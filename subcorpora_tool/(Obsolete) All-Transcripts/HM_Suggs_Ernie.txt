Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My name is Ernie Terrell Suggs, E-R-N-I-E, T-E-R-R-E-L-L, S-U-G-G-S.
Speaker 1: Now is there a story behind your name?
Speaker 2: Well I think--it's funny because I was asking my aunt about this the other day and my father's name is Shepherd [York] and I asked why wasn't I named after my father?  She said my mother [Thelma Suggs] just wanted to basically name me after what she wanted to name me.  So my name is Ernie Terrell and from what I understand I was named after a boxer named Ernie Terrell who fought Muhammad Ali. I'm not sure what year.  He didn't win obviously so I'm still not sure why I got named Ernie Terrell.  I don't know if he was a famous guy or something but yeah, I'm--supposedly I'm named after a boxer named Ernie Terrell.  Why not Cassius Clay or you know, someone else, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Ernie Terrell was not only a boxer.  He was a pretty good boxer.  He lost to Ali, but a lot of people did.  He was also an entertainer, a singer.  His sister was in The Supremes.
Speaker 2: Was his sister Tami was--not Tami Terrell but--Jean Terrell (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Jean Terrell so he comes from a very talented family.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah so you know there was something there (laughter).
Speaker 1: I thought that was you know--thought I'd ask.  Sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: March 18, 1967 in Brooklyn, New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: My occupation, I am a reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Is it February 18th--yeah February 18th, 2014 (laughter).
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: Oh, we are in Atlanta, Georgia--well technically--well yeah we're in Atlanta, Georgia at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
Story_ID: 159238
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth there are five lightweight questions we always ask as a warm-up and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Okay, oh okay. I would imagine steak. Yeah I love steak. I love a good steak, Ruth's Chris Steak House.  A nice savory steak is always good.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color is probably gold, gold.  Yeah, I like gold. I've always liked gold. I like--think it looks good on me.  I'm not wearing gold today but I've always liked gold.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of the year is probably spring.  It's not too hot, not too cold although that's when all the pollen comes out, I guess but I like the temperature of spring better than summer.  I like fall too. I like the leaves coming down.  I'm not an extreme person so I don't like the hotness of summer or the coldness of winter so I guess I'm a spring, fall guy.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Paris [France], I've been to Paris a couple of times.  I like going places where I can go and kind of see history, kind of not necessarily go to the beach and relax.  I just want to--if I'm going to go somewhere I want to go somewhere that's going to have some merit, some educational value.  So Paris is that place and it's also a very beautiful place.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: A favorite phrase or saying, that's a good question.  I don't know if that's a softball question or not.  A favorite phrase or saying probably just do your best, be the best you can be.  Try to just live my life--live your life the best you can live it for, for who you are, for who I am.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Something along those lines.
Story_ID: 159239
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side but separately and then we'll put them together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Thelma Suggs, T-H-E-L-M-A.
Speaker 1: Her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Well Suggs. She was never married, Suggs.
Speaker 1: What is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Battleboro, North Carolina and her date of birth is January 9, 1949.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Battleboro?
Speaker 2: B-A-T-T-L-E-B-O-R-O. Battleboro there is no S.
Speaker 1: Oh Battleboro, North Carolina and what is her date of birth again?
Speaker 2: January 9, 1949.
Speaker 1: Alright, now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what kind of stories (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: We can go back a couple of generations.  A couple of--my mother's mother was born in 1930.  Her name was Rosana Suggs.  She died early. She died at the age of twenty-four and she was also from Battleboro, Edgecombe County, North Carolina.  Edgecombe County, North Carolina is a kind of a rural section of eastern North Carolina.  A lot of farms there, a lot of tobacco farms, peanut farms.  So she grew up there and she had, Rosana my grandmother, had three children. My Uncle Richard [Suggs] who is the oldest and my mother and her twin brother, Thurman [Suggs].
Speaker 1: Okay, now are there any stories in your family that were passed down about slavery or emancipation or Reconstruction or any of that?
Speaker 2: Not that I, no. Not that I know of because I'm in the process now of tracing my family back.  We've gone back as far as--and we have, we have--the problem is that my grandmother died so early and that my mother and her siblings were--spent a lot of time with different people.  Different family members raised them.  My mother was five years old when her mother died.  So that part of--that part of our lineage is kind of split a little bit because we have so many different people.  There were three people at least in my mother's life that she called mother because she was raised by these--all these different people.  So as far as tracing our family back it's a little difficult because there is a lot of different parts to kind of sift through and I'm kind of going through that now.
Story_ID: 159240
Speaker 1: What did, what did your grandmother [Rosana Suggs] do for a living?
Speaker 2: I don't know. She was twenty-four when she passed away so I'm not sure what or much that she was able to do.  I mean as I said she was--I would imagine worked in the fields.  She went to Bricks School [Joseph Keasbey Brick Agricultural, Industrial, and Normal School] in Whitakers [North Carolina] and Bricks was a, was a all-black kind of boarding school so it was actually a pretty good school, but I'm not sure exactly what she did up until her death.  She had an uncle or she had a brother Uncle William who is still alive who served time in the military.  A couple of other uncles who were in--when I was a child were still in North Carolina either doing farming or you know, just regular kind of labor.  So I'm not sure exactly what my grandmother did before she died and my mother [Thelma Suggs] as I said she was five years old when she died.  So she's not clear as well as to what she may have done.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you tell us anymore about Bricks School?
Speaker 2: Bricks School, it's a school that actually closed from what I understand.  It's now a kind of a research center in Whitakers, North Carolina, but it was a school for black kids in Whitakers, North Carolina.  Obviously there was segregation so blacks weren't allowed to go to integrated schools.  So Bricks Schools--Bricks School was a small country school on the side of the road that blacks were able to attend to--blacks were able to attend.  It was supposed to be a really good school, but it closed somewhere in the mid '30s [1930s] and I think at that point they started building probably public black schools for--public but still segregated schools in Edgecombe County [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Bricks School so there is no idea who was the founder (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Actually it was a guy named Brick [sic, Thomas Sewell Inborden; land donated by Julia Elma Brewster Brick]. I don't know who Brick was, but yes some guy named Brick in Whitakers or Edgecombe County who started the school for black kids.
Speaker 1: A black man (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: And now as I said it's kind of a research center.  Kind of a place where you come and have research and you know come for meetings and things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay so there is an edifice still there?
Speaker 2: It's still there, yeah.  It still has a website and everything.
Speaker 1: Brick was black?
Speaker 2: I believe so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's a heck of a story, I mean it's kind of the story I think a lot of people forget there was a time when states didn't provide hardly any public education for black people.  So black folks would have to establish their own schools.
Speaker 2: Exactly and this is exactly what that was.
Speaker 1: So these people are part of a heroic effort to do that, you know.  So your grandmother had a chance to go--she went there (unclear).
Speaker 2: She went there, yes but that was a, that was not a college. It was, you know, a secondary school--primary school rather.
Speaker 1: Okay so did she--do you know if she had eighth grade education or high school?
Speaker 2: I think she probably went up to high school but I'm not a hundred percent sure.  She didn't go to college.
Story_ID: 159241
Speaker 1: Now what about your grandfather is--?
Speaker 2: My grandfather is from Edgecombe County as well, Battleboro [North Carolina]. His name is James Odom.  He was born, I guess, in 1922, I believe, and he was an [U.S.] Army veteran, worked for a long time in Rocky Mount [North Carolina] when I was a kid as a taxi driver.  He had his own cab in Rocky Mount, North Carolina and he died in 2005.  So we did get a chance to know him pretty well.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I take it they weren't married but--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Thelma Suggs], you know, see her father?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we saw him quite often when we lived in North Carolina.  As a matter of fact when--there was a time when we lived together.  So there was a kind of three generations in the house.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was your mother raised by her father after her mother--
Speaker 2: No, she--somewhat after my mother died she was raised by my grand--her father, her Aunt Clarene [ph.] who was my father's--my grandfather's sister and another woman named Alice Wells [ph.].  Who like I said, you could say that three people were considered my mother's mother figuratively speaking so Aunt Clarene, my grandfather and Alice Wells.  Alice Wells in a weird--well not in a weird way but Alice Wells is the person that I most consider my maternal grandmother.  She's the person that I know or that I knew as my maternal grandmother growing up as a child because she raised my mother to a certain point in her life.  And then once we came of age, we would go to North Carolina to visit her as our grandmother and all of my cousins on that side of the family consider Alice Wells as our grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay, did your mother have the closest relationship with her of all the other people that--
Speaker 2: I wouldn't say closer because I mean we were very close to Aunt Clarene.  Aunt Clarene is her aunt.  So I wouldn't say it was a closer relationship but I think that Alice--the Alice Wells relationship was significant in that Alice Wells didn't have any children of her own and was able to take in these three kids from I'm not sure how long and raise them as her own.  So she became that mother figure for my mother and her siblings and a grandmother figure for us.  Now Aunt Clarene, you know, she was a mother figure to my mother but she is still an aunt.  So she's my Aunt Clarene and we cherish her as our Aunt Clarene.
Story_ID: 159242
Speaker 1: Now, now did your mother [Thelma Suggs] have any stories about growing up that she shared with you?
Speaker 2: Just growing up, you know, she grew up in Edgecombe County [North Carolina] which is a very--Edge- if you're, if you're familiar with North Carolina, Rocky Mount [North Carolina] is a city divided into two counties.  It's the only city divided into two counties, Edgecombe County and Nash County and it's literally divided by a train track.
Speaker 1: So the city of--town of Rocky Mount actually divided by train tracks between two counties.
Speaker 2: Yeah the only county--the only city in North Carolina that's divided into two counties and literally by a train track.  Edgecombe County was generally the poor black side and Nash County was the richer white side.  So she grew up in Edgecombe County up until her teenage years and you know, it's obviously a very tough existence growing up without a mother.  So she and her brothers, you know, they went from house to house.  I imagine it was a struggle there.  In terms of stories, you know, I--stories were--never any bad stories.  I remember there was one time she talked about--it's kind of a funny story. Well, not funny but she was talking about she was walking to a--walking around the corner to a store or something and this white man spit in her face and this big glob of tobacco, southern spit right in her face but it was an accident, but it was like this huge, big glob and everybody saw it and she was mortified obviously and the man was actually very mortified by it because it wasn't intentional although that would not have been out of the norm to be intentional at that time in the '50s [1950s].  She just kind of always talked about how that happened and how the guy was very apologetic and how he, you know, bought her candy to try and make up for it.  She was somewhat surprised because he did apologize, he did say, "Oh this was an accident. All of us are not like that although I may look that way. All of us are not like that."  And you know in the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s] North Carolina was the hub of the [Ku Klux] Klan [KKK].  It wasn't as virulent as say Alabama or Mississippi, but Alabama, I mean North Carolina had one of the largest Klan populations in the country especially in eastern North Carolina.  So it would not have been out of the picture for her to be spit on by a white man on purpose.
Speaker 1: Right, North Carolina--we've had some interesting different interviews from North Carolinians.  Some paint a picture of almost Andy Griffith North Carolina with black people in it and others, it can be mean too.  You know, it's different. It's both sides seem to be true.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I really enjoyed growing up there.  I never really--I didn't have any trouble there but you know.  It's--it was still the hub of--the most populated Klan population in the country was in North Carolina.
Story_ID: 159243
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Thelma Suggs]--now growing up in these circumstances did your--was your mother able to finish school?
Speaker 2: She finished school--no she got to the eleventh grade, yeah she got to the eleventh grade and then she moved to New York [City, New York].  So yeah she got to the eleventh grade and then moved to New York.
Speaker 1: Now what arrangements had she made in New York? Or was she taking a chance or did she know somebody there?
Speaker 2: We had cousins--she had cousins there and she moved to New York with her cousin around the same time as her cousin, Vivian--Vivian Davis [ph.].  They moved to Brooklyn, New York.  She was seventeen years old, sixteen, seventeen years old when she moved.  Vivian, we call her "Wuss," was probably around the same age.  So two young girls basically moved to the city where they had relatives there, but basically they were on their own in the 1960s. And New York, you know, North Carolina--going from North Carolina the South in the '60s [1960s] to New York is you know that's a, that's a huge adjustment, so.
Speaker 1: Yeah but it was a move that was commonly made though, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, of course.
Speaker 1: Of people going up North.
Speaker 2: They were just basically part of that reverse migration back--or that migration back--or that migration to the North in the 1960s.
Speaker 1: So now, what was she able--what did she do?
Speaker 2: When she first got there?  Just, I guess just well you know she was sixteen years old so I--just found jobs around town.  Secretaries, retail just things of that nature just different kinds of jobs just to get by.  As I said she wasn't a college-educated person but she just, you know, got jobs to get by.
Speaker 1: So now what did your mother--did she have an aspiration, I mean something that she shared with you that she wanted to do or a career goal at that time?
Speaker 2: No, I mean--I don't know, you know, with the rockiness, the difficulty of her childhood I'm not sure if college was ever part of the picture.  My mother is very intelligent, reads a lot but I'm not sure if college was ever part of the equation growing up in that time period.  You know, at that point, you know, there weren't a lot of people going to college especially from Edgecombe County, North Carolina.  So I don't know if that was ever part of her plan.  So I think part of her plan was just basically to get a job whatever that may be, get away from North Carolina as quickly as possible and to establish something on her own and I think that was the goal in going to New York City.  Just to try to do something different with her life.
Speaker 1: What did she end up doing in terms of careers?
Speaker 2: Just different things.  It was always something--I can't say that my mother had a particular occupation in her life, but just retail, secretarial work, working in hospitals just different things.  She just basically--she just retired from-she lives in Raleigh [North Carolina] now, just retired or left Wake Medical Center [Raleigh, North Carolina] where she worked for about fifteen years in the--
Speaker 1: So she went back to North Carolina I'm assuming?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah.
Story_ID: 159244
Speaker 1: Let me, let me go to your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, his name is Shepherd York, S-H-E-P-H-E-R-D York.
Speaker 1: Y-O-R-K?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Is there a story behind that name?
Speaker 2: He was named after his father.  So that's why I was asking my aunt why wasn't I Shepherd York, III.  So he was named after his father Shepherd York, Sr.
Speaker 1: Okay so would he be Shepherd York, Jr. at this--
Speaker 2: I don't think he was ever called that. I'm not sure if he was, but I wouldn't put that beyond belief that that was his name.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in South Carolina.  My father's side of the family is from South Carolina, and he was born in 1947.  I can't recall the birth date. I have it.
Speaker 1: Well, that's okay, do you know where in South Carolina?
Speaker 2: Sumter, Sumter County, Sumter County South Carolina is where my father's side of the family is from.
Speaker 1: Yeah I've heard of that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Fort Sumter that's where Fort Sumter is.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what can you tell us about your father's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Probably about the same distance or the same length.  My grandmother is a great woman named Willa Mae York, and she raised a lot of kids.  I think I have probably about eight aunts and uncles that she had, children that she had in Sumter, South Carolina all of which were--that she raised pretty much with her and her first husband and then raised by herself.  But she was a great woman very outspoken woman who was basically in charge of the family.  Who was definitely, you know the leader of the family and we all knew that and we all respected that and looked up towards that and gravitated towards that.  She had an amazing capacity to get her family surrounded--to surround herself with family.  So we all basically kind of gravitated toward her.
Speaker 1: Okay, now so your father did he actually grow up in South Carolina before he moved to New York [City] or did he--
Speaker 2: Well similar to my mother's [Thelma Suggs] moving to North Carolina [sic, New York City], my grandmother at some point, Willa Mae at some point moved the family to New York.  So I'm not sure exactly when this happened but sometime in the '50s [1950s] or '60s [1960s] she moved to New York and brought all of her kids.  So my parents met in New York while he was living there.  He had already been living there.  My father was a couple years older than my mother, two years older than my mother.  Real cool guy, kind of the prince of the city somewhat and they met and had me, but my grandmother moved to New York, she moved her family as part of that migration as well from the South to a better life in New York City.  So we all kind of--all the kids--the grandkids were pretty much born in Brooklyn, New York.
Speaker 1: Okay and your father had a big family there, you know (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, his aunts--oh, I mean, I'm sorry, his sisters, his brother.
Speaker 1: Eight or nine of them or something.
Speaker 2: And they were all pretty much in New York.
Story_ID: 159245
Speaker 1: Now did your father [Shepherd York] have a chance to finish school or what, what did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: That's interesting because my father-I don't know a lot about my father.  It's interesting as I mentioned that my grandmother [Willa Mae York] had a capacity to bring family together but she had several--she had probably five daughters that I grew up around, aunts.  My father was the only guy--my father and his brother Thomas were the men, but all of the women--all of my female aunts kind of lived around each other and raised their kids around each other but my father was not around.  So my mother [Thelma Suggs] kind of became a surrogate sister.  So my mother and her kids basically grew up around her sister-in-laws and my cousins.  So it was kind of a weird existence that I was very close to all of my aunts.  My Aunt Flora [ph.], my Aunt Mat [ph.], my Aunt Trish [ph.], Ruth [ph.], Bessie [ph.] very close to all of these aunts on my father's side.  But my father was not around that much.  So I know them better than I know my father.  I know their lives--I'm still in contact with them all the time.  But it's just--it was one of these weird things where my father was not around as much.
Speaker 1: So you say he was like a prince of the city type.
Speaker 2: I mean he was a player, you know.  He wasn't a criminal or anything but you know he had girls.  My parents weren't married, but he had girls and other women and things like that.  You know he did--the things I remember about him and he's dead now but the things I remember about him, you know he was always cool, always dressed well, always wore hats and he was just--whenever he came around it was just always this big event because my father was coming around and even for my cousins because Shep's here and Shep's cool and you know all the stuff like that.  So he was--that's why I say he was a prince of the city in terms of just being kind of this larger than life figure in my existence.
Speaker 1: The stories I've heard--I've heard a few stories about family members that young men in New York [City] you would hustle for a living, basically.  Not necessarily doing anything terrible but--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah especially during those times but his sisters, you know--all of his sisters, all of my aunts you know, we are all very close.  They raised me pretty much.  It was kind of weird that he wasn't around yet his family still, you know had a huge part in my development as a person.
Speaker 1: Now what did he do for a--did he doing anything specific for a living?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I mean I just think--there are very few times--I can count really the number of times that I and I'm sure there is more and I have photos of all of it but I can count the very few times that I've actually had conversations with my father as a child.  So I'm not sure exactly what he did. I do remember--I mean he had a big influence on my life obviously because he is my father.  I remember vividly one of the early conversations not really a conversation but he had come by, he had taken me out and I think one of his friends asked what was I going to do when I got big and I said I was going to be a pimp and you know in the 1970s that was the aspirational goal in New York City.  I remember him stopping in the middle of the street and saying you know, "You're not going to be a pimp, you're going to be a scientist."  He said I was going to be a scientist and I think you know when I said that--when my mother was growing up it wasn't--I don't think college was something that she thought about or that generation thought about.  When I was growing up I was always the kid, the one kid in my family of all these kids who were growing who everyone knew was going to college.  So at that point he specifically said--he crystallized it and said, "You're not going to be a pimp" and I wasn't going to be a pimp.
Speaker 1: I just wondered if you were using that and did you really understand what being a pimp entailed--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, I just--
Speaker 1: --Or were you just saying it in the vernacular of the street that you were going to be cool and such?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't know what it meant. I didn't know if I meant that I was going to be cool, I just thought it was a person who had nice clothes and a nice car.
Speaker 1: I just want to clarify that because I know in the black community people used to say that, that their aspirations were, I'm pimping now because I'm dressed up but it didn't necessarily mean they were actually doing the activities of a real pimp.
Speaker 2: I wasn't going to trade women and drugs but I wanted to be cool and have a nice car, a Cadillac and you know I wanted to have women.  But I was like five or six years old so I didn't really understand what it meant to be a pimp.  So he said, "No you're going to be a scientist, you're going to go to college," and you know, I think that right there is one of the you know--as I said we didn't have a lot of conversations that I remember but that right there basically was this conversation that I always remembered.  It was very quick, very succinct but I always remembered that.
Speaker 1: It does indicate that he was looking out for you.  He was looking out for you--he projected for you some kind of a positive, you know--
Speaker 2: And you know, I don't doubt that he was always looking out for me and I don't have any resentment toward my father or anything like that.  It was just--and I think I don't have any resentment towards him because of his family.  His family was always so embracing of us and you know as I said, we grew up--I grew up in that family.  So I don't have any resentment towards him at all.  It was just the way things were in those times.
Speaker 1: Do you know if he supported you financially or not or if--
Speaker 2: No well not you know I think probably early on when I was a kid, yeah I'm sure and as I said we were part of his family.  We became a part of his family so if not him than his mother, his aunts.
Speaker 1: What you have is a real extended family.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: Them, them taking on the responsibility of raising his son.
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly and I, and, and my--as I said my aunts, they all live-- pretty much live in South Carolina now, you know, but my aunts I love them to death, you know, because they really, really helped me in my development.
Story_ID: 159246
Speaker 1: When you consider your parents [Thelma Suggs and Shepherd York] meeting, is there a story that they tell about how they met or, or how they got together?
Speaker 2: No I just think they met--you know they were both young.  They met at a dance or somewhere or maybe introduced by one of his sisters or something.  So I'm not sure exactly how they met, but you know, they were a couple for a few years and they've always remained friendly.  They never married obviously, but they always remained friendly up until his death.
Speaker 1: Okay, now when you consider their personalities, their dispositions, their sense of humor, how they walk, talk, what they look like, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Oh I think my mother, yeah.  Everyone says I look exactly like her.  So yeah I think I take after her.  My mother is very kind, giving. I think I am.  I grew up with her. I was raised by her so I think you know most of my mannerisms are probably from her.  When I go visit my aunts they say things about things that I do that remind me--remind them of my father, but I think personally--I think I look like my mother and I probably act like her.  So I think probably get more from her.
Speaker 1: Is your mother tall?
Speaker 2: She's tall for a woman I would imagine.  She's probably about 5'7".
Speaker 1: And you're about what?
Speaker 2: 6'2", 6'3". My father was tall so I get that from him and his, his brother Thomas was tall.  My mother's brother--twin brother [Thurman Suggs] is tall as well.  So I probably get some of that height from them.
Story_ID: 159247
Speaker 1: Do, do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have a brother and a sister.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you name them beginning with the first one and, and just tell us a little bit about your brother and sister?
Speaker 2: Well, Stephanie Jones, my sister and Eric Suggs is my brother.  Now the thing about and you can ask me if you want, but I was pretty much raised--there is a weird story about my sister.  Well, not a weird story about my sister, but I was pretty much raised with my brother, Eric.  So Eric--it was always me and Eric.
Speaker 1: Are you the oldest?
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest.  Eric is the youngest.  So I guess I'll jump to 2009 if you want.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's a pretty big jump. Now we're gonna have to jump back.
Speaker 2: Well when you asked about the siblings.  Well in 2009--all of us are one year apart.  So I was born in 1967, Stephanie was born in 1968, Eric was born 1969, and Stephanie didn't grow up with us and in 2000--Stephanie's existence pretty much disappeared.  She just basically disappeared from our lives.  So she was gone, probably, I don't even remember.  It was that--and I don't think my brother ever even had any acknowledgement of her.
Speaker 1: She wasn't mentioned in the family at all or anything?
Speaker 2: No, well she was mentioned.  When you have kind of like childhood recollections you know there was always something in the back of my mind about someone else and sometimes my aunts would say things that would suggest there was someone else, and I think even as a child, even probably as a child in New York [City], there was probably--I probably remember references to Stephanie, but as I said my brother didn't because my brother was--Stephanie was gone by the time he was born.  But I still kind of remember people making mention of a sister and then it just kind of vanished.  We never talked about it. No one ever mentioned it.  As I said there may be some mention of it, you know some old person may say, you know, whatever happened to that girl or whatever and I wouldn't pay any attention to it.  So then in 2009, I got a message on Facebook asking me, am I Thelma Suggs' son and did I go by Punky. Punky is my nickname.  At that point, you know, I went to public high school in New York City, PS 241 [Emma L. Johnston School, Brooklyn, New York].  That was in a gifted program and I'd been sending out inquiries about people who were in my class.  I was thinking about writing a book or an article about the people who were in that gifted program in this school.  To try to I don't know write a book about whatever happened to these gifted black kids in this poor school in Brooklyn [New York].  So I had been sending out inquiries for about a year. Nothing really had happened.  So I assumed when I got this message on Facebook--this random Facebook message that it was somebody that I went to school with and I said, "Yeah I'm Ernie Suggs. Who wants to know?"  And as soon as I sent it, something--something told me that that was my sister.  It was just like, you know--I think I said this is it and so she sends me a message back on Facebook it's like you know, "I think we're related." You know, "I've been looking for you guys."  You know, "I would really like to talk to you."  And I had no reason to believe--it's weird because having never had a conversation--a full conversation about her I had no reason to not believe that this was my sister because there was these kind of childhood memories kind of coming to fore--coming to bear.  So we exchanged numbers, and she called me, and she told me basically the story about where she had been and her life until then, and I called my brother at first and was like you know, "This woman called and said she's our sister and do you remember any stories about this at all?"  He was like, "No," 'cause as I said he was younger.  So I said well, "When mommy [Thelma Suggs] gets home, have her call me. Don't tell her but just have her call me."  So my mother called me and I told her. I said, "Look this woman called saying she's your daughter, and she wants to talk to you and what do you want me to do."  There was silence on the phone and she's like, "Well, give her the number and have her call me," and she called and we had this reunification of family, 2009. I think it was 2009 and we've been in touch ever since and you know, we've kind of--I don't want to say picked up the pieces where we left off but you know kind of getting to know each other--
Story_ID: 159248
Speaker 1: --What happened [to Suggs' sister, Stephanie Jones]?
Speaker 2: Well, that's the, that's the thing.
Speaker 1: Is she a full sister of yours?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's a full sister.
Speaker 1: What happened? Why did she disappear?
Speaker 2: There, there are several theories. I think--I don't know exactly what happened, but I think each side of it has its own version of it and my mother's [Thelma Suggs] side of it is that she--as I said my mother was young when she had me. She was seventeen when she had me, eighteen when she had Stephanie, and there was a family that would look after her or they would I guess kind of look after her.  They owned a store or they owned a laundry mat or some kind of store or something and she would go in there and talk to them, and they would see me and my sister and talk to us.  They knew my mother as this young woman with two kids, pretty much on her own although we had--but she was kind of on her own.  At some point my mother, left Stephanie there and she came back and they were gone.  The store was closed, they packed up and left. They had vanished.  I don't know to what involvement did the police have or any other of my relatives had or my father [Shepherd York] had in terms of finding her or finding these people.  They had just vanished, and they were gone.  So you have an eighteen year old woman--eighteen year old woman with two kids, poor and you know my Aunt Flor [ph.] who was my father's oldest surviving sister would often say my mother was so young that--not these things happen but she was so young that she didn't know what to do or she didn't know or no one really knew how to handle the situation or what to do about the situation.  So I don't know in terms of what kind of police investigations there were into it at all.  But Stephanie's side of it--Stephanie was raised very well.  She is a probation officer in New York City now, but her side of the story is that--her parents' side of the story is that--she was dropped off, and she was given to them and raised--given to them to be raised.  So I think there is probably both sides believe there is truth in both stories but I don't know if we'll ever know the full answer.
Speaker 1: Did her parents like--they lived in New York City too, right? They lived in New York?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) they moved from Brooklyn [New York].  Stephanie was actually raised--they moved from Brooklyn to Long Island [New York] so she was raised in Long Island not Brooklyn where the rest of us were.  So I guess they packed up and moved to Long Island.
Speaker 1: Okay, rural part of Long Island (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah so they moved to a place where we didn't know where they were or no one knew where they were.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and you know--for an eighteen year old girl from North Carolina, New York City is this huge, big place and these two, you know, these adults vanished so you don't know what to do.
Speaker 1: So there were no legal papers that she signed or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, there was no legal turning over of Stephanie to these people.  They just--I don't want to say took her but they took her.
Speaker 1: That's what it sounds like.
Speaker 2: Yeah but you know, I don't, you know--they say that they were--Stephanie was given to them so.
Speaker 1: I don't think they would say anything different now.
Speaker 2: Well yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know that's, that's interesting, that's an interesting story.  One of these New York stories.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Like they say.
Story_ID: 159249
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I mean, but you know, Stephanie [Jones]--it's you know, it's been great getting to know her.  She, we talk all the time.  She and my brother [Eric Suggs] talk like every day.  She and my mother [Thelma Suggs] talks every day.
Speaker 2: So she is a probation officer?
Speaker 1: Yeah so she basically had a pretty good upbringing, but she always had this nagging feeling about something was missing in her life, and I think, I think early on--I think early on, she sensed that she was different from her parents or the people that was raising her.
Speaker 2: Did she have any other siblings when she was being raised, I mean did she have--
Speaker 1: No, no, the people were older so they were older, an older couple.  The man just died probably two years ago, the person that was her father figure just died a couple of years ago and my mother actually went to the hospital and visited him after all these years and they talked.  But yeah, so she had a feeling that she was different early on and just didn't know how to, how to approach it.  I think as she got older and as that father figure got older he started telling her things and said, "Hey there is this woman named Thelma. She had a son named Punky. I don't know what his real name is."  And she, you know, Facebook--she found me through social media.
Speaker 2: What happened to her adopted mother?
Speaker 1: Her adopted mother is still alive and still living in New York [City].
Speaker 2: Is there any kind of interaction between the adopted mother and your mother?
Speaker 1: No, no, no there was not--I don't think so.  As I said my mother did go and visit the father in the hospital when he was sick and had a conversation with him, but I don't think she's had any kind of relationship with the mother.  I imagine there is probably some guilt on both parts there.
Speaker 2: Yeah I would just imagine the actual action whether it was the way she describes it or not was precipitated by the adopted mother rather than the father. I'm sure of that.  Not even knowing I'm sure that's probably what happened.  Most men are not going to adopt a baby or convince their wife (laughter) so that accounts for the no contact, no discussion today.
Speaker 1: So yeah, but it's one of those weird things.  I haven't really talked about it a lot.  As soon as she called, I just knew she was my sister.
Speaker 2: That's an interesting story. That's an unusual story but it's got a happy ending at least.
Speaker 1: Things are fine. She was going to come down here a couple of weekends ago but her son just got accepted into Buffalo State [State University of New York College at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York]--she has a son--so she had to go up for a visit so she had to miss that, but--
Story_ID: 159250
Speaker 1: You were born in Brooklyn [New York]?  Were you raised in Brooklyn (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Until I was twelve--until I was, yeah, until I was about eleven or twelve then we moved to North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, I didn't know that. Okay, so what are some of your early memories of your neighborhood in Brooklyn?  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: I really enjoyed Brooklyn.  Brooklyn was--that's all I knew up until I was twelve years old so that urban city life was all that I knew.  And as I said, growing up around all my cousins was great, kind of knowing all them and getting to know them all.  The [New York] Yankees were a big part of my life.  In the '70s [1970s] the Yankees won the World Series in '77 [1977] and '78 [1978].  So they became a huge part of my life.  Coney Island, subway trains, how loud the trains were at that time even kind of like--even in the late '70s [1970s] early--or I guess the late '70s [1970s] even the kind of the changing of the music in terms of like you know going from soul music to kind of disco music to--which became hip hop.  I was kind of there when all that kind of stuff was happening and I remember block parties when people would steal power from the light post to power their turntables and they would just play these disco, hip hop songs.  So I remember that kind of coming of age during that period of time which is kind of, pretty cool.
Speaker 1: So you were about--you were ten I guess when the Yankees were in the World Series? Ten and eleven (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah well they went in '76 [1976] as well. They lost in '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Yeah to the [Cincinnati] Reds. I remember to the Reds. Being from Cincy [Cincinnati, Ohio]--being from Dayton [Ohio], I remember the Reds.
Speaker 2: So yeah, '77 [1977], '78 [1978] that's when Reggie Jackson came.  Reggie Jackson is my favorite baseball player of all time still.
Speaker 1: Yeah Mr. October.
Speaker 2: Exactly, so the three home runs in '77 [1977] World Series.  So yeah so that time, you know, going to Coney Island just being--you know, that's all I knew was New York City.
Story_ID: 159251
Speaker 1: So, you know, and all I knew was Brooklyn [New York].  I went to this PS 241 [Emma L. Johnston School, Brooklyn, New York] and I was in the as I mentioned before I was in this intelligently gifted program, IGC.
Speaker 2: Now this is at PS 241?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So what were you--what made them think that you were intelligent in that period of time (laughter)?  What kind of activities were you engaged in as a kid and what did you like?
Speaker 1: I was always reading, you know I was always--I was somewhat different from my cousins because I was always reading, reading comic books. I was always reading comic books, and I never really got in trouble.  Not necessarily crime trouble, but I just never got in trouble.  I was just always kind of the kid who'd sit around reading and I remember one instance where I would steal newspapers and that was the extent of my life of crime growing up in Brooklyn.
Speaker 2: Explain this, now you liked comic books. Was that the literature available?
Speaker 1: Well yeah literature that's available for fifteen cents, ten, fifteen cents, and you know, obviously books as well.  We lived--I mean one of the great things about Brooklyn is that we lived right at the cultural center of Brooklyn.  So we lived near the botanical garden [Brooklyn Botanic Garden], lived near the Brooklyn library, near Prospect Park, near the planetarium, that's all in our neighborhood.
Speaker 2: That's--I've only been in that area once and that museum is just huge, blocks and blocks of stuff in there.
Speaker 1: Yeah so that's our neighborhood. That's where I grew up.  So I would go to the library everyday and check out books.  I would go to the [Brooklyn] Museum every day and just walk the halls just to look at the art, just look at the sculptures and the exhibits, go to the planetarium, the botanical gardens, Prospect Park, again that's all our neighborhood.  So I would take--I guess I was smart enough to kind of take advantage of these cultural outlets that were there for me in Brooklyn.  So when I got to PS 241, I guess I tested well or did well to be placed into this gifted program.  So from the third through the fifth grade at the school I was in this intelligently gifted class so to speak.
Speaker 2: I wonder now is there anybody that basically encouraged your activities in reading and going to museums?
Speaker 1: As I said my mother [Thelma Suggs] was always very well read and still is and my aunts.  Again I give a lot of credit to my aunts who you know--they--I don't want to say struggled but you have all these women who are raising all these kids and they're trying to do the best they can for all these kids and trying to--seeing what's out there.  The fact that we grew up in this kind of cultural garden but all around us you know right down the street people were getting killed and shot doing whatever God knows what.  So they tried their best to kind of keep us focused and on a path to something and I was one who kind of took to that.  I knew that I--I don't know how I knew or why I knew, but they encouraged it as well but I knew I was going to go to college from the third grade when my father [Shepherd York] told me I was going to be a scientist.  I knew that I wasn't--high school wasn't going to be the last step for me.  I remember like there was commercials in the '70s [1970s] about you know getting a high school diploma. That was like the big thing you get a high school diploma, but I knew that I wanted to go to college at some point and do something.
Speaker 2: But up to this point, no one in your family had gone to college?
Speaker 1: No, no one in my family had gone to college.
Speaker 2: None of your cousins or any of them?
Speaker 1: No but I knew that I was--I knew that that's what I wanted to do and I you know, I, I guess I kind of prepared myself for it early on by reading and not getting in trouble and you know, focusing on sports and not doing drugs things like that so.
Story_ID: 159252
Speaker 1: So did you play a lot of baseball yourself or?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, in New York [City] particularly.  New York, I mean, we didn't--I didn't play organized baseball in New York.  I played stick ball, of course in the streets, basketball street games.  I didn't play--I didn't start playing organized sports until I moved to North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's a lot been written about street basketball in New York, in the playgrounds.  They did a movie ['Rebound: The Legend of Earl 'The Goat' Manigault'] about Manigault.
Speaker 2: Yeah, "The Goat."
Speaker 1: "The Goat" and the Rucker League.
Speaker 2: Well I wasn't that good (laughter).
Speaker 1: But did you--you had to have been a little kid, I guess.  Did you go and watch his games?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I would see those--in New York you're always immersed in all these activities.  So this Rucker League, street ball in those times was huge. It was just as big as the NBA [National Basketball Association] is now especially to those who don't have access to the NBA.  This is what you have access to so that kind of stuff was huge in my growing up and development.  You know but street games, just hanging out with my cousins some of whom were part of that Rucker League or playing street ball or whatever because I was one of the younger kids in the family.  So it was all part of it and I saw this going to Coney Island.  It's funny because when I was a kid I never remember going to like Times Square or anything like that.  I remember going downtown was like downtown Brooklyn [New York] so I don't recall ever going to Manhattan [New York]. I'm pretty sure I did on school trips or whatever, and I think I went to the Empire State Building, but I don't ever remember--I think I have photos of me at the Empire State Building as a kid but I never remember actually going to Manhattan 'cause Manhattan was like the city and Brooklyn was kind of like our neighborhood.  Manhattan was like this world away.
Speaker 1: People don't--I don't think most people realize now the size of Brooklyn.  Brooklyn is like-Chicago [Illinois] is like three and half million people, Brooklyn is six [million], just in Brooklyn.
Speaker 2: I think Brooklyn would be the fourth largest city in the country if it was on its own so it's huge.
Speaker 1: Yeah it's a huge place.  Well city life in Brooklyn is a whole--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a whole different culture so there is no real reason to go to Manhattan or Queens [New York] or Staten Island [New York] or wherever.
Speaker 1: You've got like a melting pot of people and especially black people.  You've got like the Caribbean meets North and South Carolina and Virginia.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean one of the things about in terms of diversity growing up in Brooklyn, I just met people--went to school with people of all--Jewish kids, Jamaicans, Dominicans, Asians.  You look at my class pictures, and there was just every--it's a melting pot and that was so totally different than when I moved to North Carolina.  It was basically black--a black and white existence.  So, so Brooklyn was--played a huge role in my life.
Story_ID: 159253
Speaker 1: Back to the newspapers though, you would--why would you be so desperate to get a newspaper?
Speaker 2: I liked to know what was going on so I would--you know, back in those days and I'm sure it's still now they had the newsstands where the newspapers would just basically be out and I would just walk by and pick one up and just keep walking (laughter).  So that was my--that was the existence of my life of crime.  So I would steal the [New York] Post, the [New York] Daily News, the New York Times to just kind of read what was going on.  I enjoyed--I think I was able to understand the Post and the Daily News a little better because it was about New York, and it always had those spectacular headlines.  The New York Times is a little bit high-brow for a preteen.  But yeah I would just read it, pick it up and take it to the house, let somebody else read it but you know that was one of things I would do, steal newspapers.
Speaker 1: So there wasn't a particular part, I know you were a sports writer at one point in high school.
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't anything--
Speaker 1: It wasn't because of the sports necessarily.
Speaker 2: No, I would read everything.  I would read what was going on in the city, you know, the blackout.
Speaker 1: The blackout was yeah go head.
Speaker 2: The '70s [1970s] there was so much stuff going on in New York City with the blackouts with the bankruptcy, the Bella Abzug and [Mayor] Ed Koch.  For me it was a very exciting time.  There was always stuff happening.  So I would want to know what was going on. I would want to know what was actually going on in the city in terms of murders, the [New York] Yankees of course, TV shows.  I loved watching television so reading was probably an extension of that.  So yeah I wanted to read everything. I wanted to know what was going on particularly in the city.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I imagine I stole the Post and the Daily News more than the Times.
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite writers in the newspaper?
Speaker 2: No it wasn't any--it was just like what's going on in the news today.  I would just go by and snatch it and just keep walking and that was it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I wasn't trying to go see what Bill Madden wrote or anything.
Speaker 1: So at P.S. 241 [Emma L. Johnston School, Brooklyn, New York] you're in a gifted program and like who's in school with you? Is it mostly African American or is it mixed?
Speaker 2: It's mostly African Americans. It's a Brooklyn neighborhood so it's mostly African American but it was--it had a good deal of diversity as well particularly in the gifted program.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, yeah as I said the diversity was there.  I mean, I learned a lot about diversity in New York in, at P.S. 241 in terms of different cultures, languages, different types of people.
Story_ID: 159254
Speaker 1: At P.S. 241 [Emma L. Johnston School, Brooklyn, New York] were there any special teachers or mentors there?
Speaker 2: The only teacher I remember is my fifth grade teacher, Ms. Isaacs [ph.].  I remember Ms. Weiss [ph.] and Ms. Niabongo [ph.], she's our music teacher. She was really good.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Ms. Niabongo.
Speaker 1: Is that--was she African?
Speaker 2: No, I think she was either Jamaican or Bohemian--Bahamian, but yeah she taught us music.  She taught me how to play the violin so I played the violin for a while.  So she was probably--those are probably the three most influential teachers there.
Speaker 1: Alright so now at this stage did you--your father [Shepherd York] said you were going to be a scientist. Were you actually drawn to science or were you more--
Speaker 2: No I think he said scientist just to--
Speaker 1: To elevate the discussion.
Speaker 2: But I don't think I was particularly drawn to science or had aspirations to be a doctor or anything like that.  I just think he just said scientist as kind of a catch all for you're not going to be a pimp (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay so what were you drawn to? Were you drawn to literature in terms of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was drawn to literature. I probably was drawn to history, sports, but yeah I, I enjoyed reading. I enjoyed--I said I enjoyed comic books so I guess I liked the literature of comic books--
Story_ID: 159255
Speaker 1: Now what about com- now comic books--we could, could get real specific with comic books today and not be considered you know, doing something wrong or something, but who--what comic book characters did you like and what, what authors? I mean, can you name some authors and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I was a Marvel guy so you know there is Marvel Universe and DC Universe.  I was a Marvel Universe because Marvel Universe the characters were--a lot of them were based in New York [City, New York], obviously and it was actually New York instead of Gotham City or Metropolis and a lot of them had issues or they had real life issues. The alter egos had real life issues.  So I liked Spider-Man, of course, the Avengers, the X-Men because X-Men were kind of these mutant figures and there is this whole theory that the X-Men and Magneto or Professor X and Magneto who was his arch villain--and this is getting real deep--were supposedly representations of [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] and Malcolm X because the X-Men were mutants and they were outsiders who were trying to gain equality and Martin Luther King and Professor X had the same kind of pattern towards that whereas Magneto was also a mutant but had a different kind of fight first kind of attitude towards equality.  So the comic books had that kind of realist- realism in it kind of hidden within the fighting and buildings being blown up.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's right, that's true it took me some years to figure that out.  I read them when I was in high school, but story lines kind of changed over the years.  When I wasn't reading them this thing develops between the Professor X as being like the Martin Luther King type.  Let's all trying to integrate into the, you know, thing.
Speaker 2: And Magneto was by any means necessary.
Speaker 1: Let's pull, close ranks and defend ourselves, basically.
Speaker 2: And they both wanted the same thing ultimately is equality for the mutants, equality for the African Americans.
Speaker 1: Right, right so those are your favorites of the--X-Men--
Speaker 2: Yeah the Avengers. I liked the Avengers.
Speaker 1: --Avengers story. What about the Avengers what was--
Speaker 2: I just liked the team aspect of it.  As I said it was still based in New York.  I liked the characters, the Scarlet Witch, Vision, Ant Man, Giant Man, the Wasp.
Speaker 1: Now, he was a controversial figure from what I understand.
Speaker 2: Which one?
Speaker 1: Ant Man or Giant Man he got into really--he--
Speaker 2: Yeah he was abusing his wife or something at some point (laughter).  Yeah, it was--it got kind of weird, yeah that he was like--it was like abuse going on there.  So it got kind of weird and I think he died eventually or something?
Speaker 1: I think so. I think they killed him off, but you know how comic book death was.
Speaker 2: He becomes a--they save part of his DNA, and he's something else (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, okay so did you pay attention to who was writing these comic books and drawing on them?
Speaker 2: I kind of paid attention a little bit to who's drawing them like Steve Busemi [sic, Sal Buscema]. I think I remember him.  Kirby, King Kirby.
Speaker 1: Jack Kirby.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Jack King Kirby.  Those are the ones--I haven't read a comic book--I still--if I go to a comic book store or something I may pick up a couple, but I haven't read them regularly in years.  So I don't subscribe to them now, but if I go and see something that's kind of cool--a kind of new series I may pick that up.  There was a series I bought a few years ago about what DC characters were merged with Marvel characters and they had like a twenty book series of that and I bought those so it's kind of cool.  So there would be something special that I'd buy.
Speaker 1: Okay, you know in the early days they said comic books would deteriorate the minds of youth (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh I know, yeah.
Speaker 1: They've got a comic books code to try to you know dictate what can be done in a comic book and said.
Speaker 2: But I think it is especially for--I don't think you should discount comic books as a part of literature and it's something that kids are reading.  If you look at one of my favorite shows, 'The Big Bang Theory.'  It's a show about these four nerds and one of their biggest thing--these four Ph.D.s, one's an astronaut and they've done all these things and they go to the comic book store every Wednesday to buy new comic books.  It's part of literature and it's a part of a kind of mythology, and I think it should be encouraged.  Or not necessarily encouraged but I don't think it should be discouraged if you kid wants to read comic books.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember Stan Lee would--a lot of his titles back in the '60s [1960s] when he was writing would be references to classical literature.
Speaker 2: Oh sure, yeah.
Speaker 1: The Iceman Cometh! you know the Shakespearian titles and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: I mean he--a lot of Marvel comics are based in history and mythology, Thor, Hercules and a lot of--even some of the contemporary things are based on kind of stories or themes that we all kind of grew up with.  The Malcolm X, Martin Luther King one is a prime example.
Speaker 1: Yeah black characters I think Marvel had two black characters.
Speaker 2: They had Luke Cage Hero for Hire, they had Ahura [Boltagon], Storm, the Black Panther, of course, the Falcon--I think he was the first.  Captain America and Falcon he was a falcon (laughter) but I think he was kind of the first.
Speaker 1: Did you pay particular attention to how the African American characters--
Speaker 2: Oh sure, yeah.  I wasn't a big Black Panther fan, but I did like the Falcon. I did like Storm and Luke Cage had his own title book so I bought his comic books. He was pretty good.
Speaker 1: He was almost like a sports figure in free agency or something, in some ways he had--you had to pay him or something or was that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was basically (laughter) he was like--I think he was a thug or something and somehow got super powers and became Hero for Hire.
Speaker 1: It's like they pay him. It seems kind of like analogous to some sports figures.  They have certain powers and you have to pay them if you want to see them.
Speaker 2: Well, he was good, I really enjoyed his books.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he, you know he, I think he worked in Harlem [New York], you know, so it was, it was definitely a book that was designed to get black people you know and it worked.  I thought it was a good book.

Speaker 1: Now, when you're thirteen now did, did you go to the eighth grade in New York [City] or in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: I went to the seventh--seventh grade in North Carolina, no part of the sixth grade and the seventh grade in North Carolina--part of the sixth grade and full seventh grade.
Speaker 1: Now what precipitated the family--your mother [Thelma Suggs]--now did your mother just move you and your brother [Eric Suggs] there?
Speaker 2: All of us moved.
Speaker 1: Okay so the three of you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the three of us. You know as I said my mother is from North Carolina so she decided you know--at that point New York was probably getting a little rough.  We had crack coming in.  Crack was still a couple of years away but you know it was getting a little worse than what we had been used to.  So I think she decided to just kind of go back to a calmer life of North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay so this is in 1980?
Speaker 2: 1979.
Speaker 1: Seventy-nine [1979].
Speaker 2: Yeah '79 [1979] 'cause I was part of the sixth grade.  I was part of sixth grade in New York, part of sixth grade in North Carolina.
Story_ID: 159257
Speaker 1: So before you left New York [City], as you were saying before, you had a chance to see this music change and Brooklyn [New York] is--I guess that's the home of hip hop, right in terms of--and you saw the disc jockeys in a--(simultaneous)--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: I saw it kind of starting. I saw it kind of coming, yeah.  You know as I said, at the block parties these guys would have these records and Kraftwerk and Africa Bambaataa and all these kind of guys--Blondie.  This was kind of like the shifting of the winds kind of music away from Marvin Gaye and The Manhattans toward this kind of funkier dance kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you actually saw these guys, Afrika Bambaataa and others.
Speaker 2: Yeah I remember these guys very well.  You know we used to have block parties and people would come and have turntables and people would get on the mic [microphone] and rap.  You didn't necessarily know what they were doing particularly.  They were talking and kind of chanting and doing the call and response but basically they were rapping and that's what they were doing.  It was like becoming this whole new genre of music that we weren't necessarily sure what it was but you know it was something different.
Speaker 1: Sugarhill Gang and all them. Now were you still in New York when Stevie Wonder started a [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] birthday campaign?
Speaker 2: No I think that was--no I think I was in North Carolina by then.  I think that was probably--
Speaker 1: I know that was in early '80s [1980s].  It was either '80 [1980] or '81 [1981].
Speaker 2: 'Cause it was under [President Ronald] Reagan.
Speaker 1: When Ronald Reagan was president that's right so it had to be after 1980 'cause--
Speaker 2: Yeah after '81 [1981] or something.
Speaker 1: Reagan took office in '80 [1980] I think or--
Speaker 2: And it became a holiday in '86 [1986] fully I think it fully became a holiday in '86 [1986].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 159258
Speaker 1: Now where did you go to school in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: I went to school in Rocky Mount, North Carolina so I went to Parker Junior High School [J.W. Parker Middle School, Rocky Mount, North Carolina], Edwards Junior High School [Rocky Mount, North Carolina] and then Rocky Mount Senior High School [Rocky Mount High School, Rocky Mount, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Now why two junior high schools?  Did the family move?
Speaker 2: No we just had two junior high schools in our town.  Rocky Mount as I said before Rocky Mount is a city, kind of a small city of about fifty thousand people and it's broken up into several different--at the time it was broken up into where the city school system.  So all the neighborhoods had their own elementary school and as you graduated you went to--we all kind of went to our own elementary schools or they did. I wasn't there.  Then you went to Parker Junior High School which for some reason was only--that year was only one grade, seventh grade.  I think that was probably because some kind of transition and then we went to Edwards Junior High School which was eighth and ninth grade and then we graduated to the senior high school which was tenth, eleventh and twelfth grade.  So Parker and Edwards were just basically step schools.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright so since they were both called junior high school, I thought they were the same.
Speaker 2: No they were--Parker was just a seventh grade school.  So we all went to this--we were just there by ourselves (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay and what was the high school called?
Speaker 2: Rocky Mount Senior High School.
Speaker 1: Okay, Rocky Mount Senior was the level of education the same as when you were in the gifted program in Brooklyn [New York]?
Speaker 2: It was probably a little bit higher in Brooklyn because it was gifted.  I went to a pretty good school anyway and it was a gifted program so I guess it was a little bit harder in New York than it was in North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Did they have a gifted program there in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: You know they did.  Well they had this--it was weird because they had three sets of tracks.  Modified, regular and accelerated and those were obviously self-explanatory, but I was always in the regular track and I could never--once you got in a track you know there is this tracking program or whatever, it was hard to get out of it unless you were--
Speaker 1: Now wait a minute you were in a gifted program in Brooklyn, New York with all these kids, millions of kids and you're in a gifted program but in North Carolina you're in a regular track?
Speaker 2: Yeah and I couldn't get out of it.  I mean I made A's. Yeah it was a very interesting system they had.  I think there were stories about it and there was talk about it.  It's tracking, basically tracking, and I don't know if it was because of where I lived or if I was black but I could never--(simultaneous)--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: Race-based.
Speaker 2: I think it was a lot of race. I mean, obviously a lot of the accelerated kids were white and a lot of people in the accelerated classes--it was like the people in accelerated classes were either white or affluent blacks.  So I think that that had something to do with the tracking system.  I think there was an expectation that these kids would do better or could do better or it would be better politically for them to be in these programs than the majority of us who were in the average program.  So I remember once--I remember several times making all A's in English and making all A's in social studies and just never being able to get into the accelerated track.  I don't know what that was all about but--
Speaker 1: It may be about the clout your parents have.
Speaker 2: And I think that--
Speaker 1: Their ability to show up at school and agitate the teachers.
Speaker 2: No, I think that has a lot and I think that's a part of it and about where I lived or who my father is or who my mother is and if my mother is a teacher there or is in the Rotary Club or whatever.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's really like a horror story of school in some ways that you could be trapped, not based on merit necessarily but just based on--
Speaker 2: And that affects your grade point average, and you know, I imagine there were people in the modified program who were, you know, should have been in regular or accelerated who couldn't get out of it and therefore their grade point averages were weighted differently.  So it was a very, very you know, weird kind of system.
Story_ID: 159259
Speaker 1: In high school [at Rocky Mount High School, Rocky Mount, North Carolina] did you take any college prep courses at all like I mean, chemistry and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh sure. I mean, yeah, so I mean I still, you know, I--although I was always in regular classes, I think I probably--I think I did take accelerated English, but that was it.  I wasn't in the full accelerated program. All my classes were accelerated or AP [advanced placement].  So I took accelerated English, but yeah I took all the classes that were preparing me for college.  So the--I guess the four Englishs, the three maths, the three sciences all in preparation of going to college.
Speaker 1: Okay so people from the regular track could go to college?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, and I imagine people from the modified track can go as well, but I think that just like AP English is weighted higher than regular English.  I think the accelerated is probably weighted higher than regular.  You're not going to get--if I make all A's in regular classes and someone else makes all A's in accelerated, I'm pretty sure that person is going to be the valedictorian other than the person who made all A's in modified.  So I think that's what it is, but yes I still was able to take as a regular student all of my required courses for college.  So I didn't have any trouble getting into college or anything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 159260
Speaker 1: Now were you pretty active as a student [at Rocky Mount High School, Rocky Mount, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I was--I mean, I played--I was active in sports. I was active in the school newspaper.  You know, moving to North Carolina was actually good, you know, I really--because as I said New York [City] was--it could be a tough existence in terms of living in a dense, urban environment and moving to North Carolina where it's wide open spaces kind of so to speak. I mean we lived in--we didn't live in the country.  We lived in the city.  Rocky Mount is a city kind of a suburban type city as far as that goes.  Not Mount Airy [North Carolina] but you know it's a city.  So you know you were able to play sports, play pony league baseball and play in city basketball leagues and city football leagues and walk home--just walk home from school and just feel that you're walking home and you're safe and nothing's going to happen to you.  So the question was I active, yeah. I was very active in high school in every aspect of--I was never home basically after school.  I was always doing something.
Speaker 1: Okay and you wrote for the school newspaper?
Speaker 2: Yeah I wrote for the school newspaper that's called The Gryphon.  My high school was called Rocky Mount Senior High and we were the Gryphons--that was our mascot--and our school paper was called The Gryphon.
Speaker 1: Okay, now how did--did you play any varsity sports?
Speaker 2: No, well I was a trainer on the basketball and football team and I was on the baseball team.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: But I was the manager/trainer for football and basketball.
Story_ID: 159261
Speaker 1: Were there any special teachers or mentors there [at Rocky Mount High School, Rocky Mount, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, Mr. Davis [ph.].  Mr. Davis was our principal, black guy, and we had a little bit about--when you talk about the track system we had a weird system where we had a black principal and a white principal at our high school and we had--
Speaker 1: Of equal status?
Speaker 2: Of equal status, yeah.  It was a black principal and a white principal.  Mr. Davis was the black principal, and he didn't necessarily have jurisdiction over the black students, but he was just a black principal.  And we had black queens and homecoming queens and white homecoming queens.  So every year there would be a black queen and a white queen and a black court and a white court.  So I think that's kind of a remnant of integration and how--when the schools integrated in the '60s [1960s] as part of a compromise to have all these queens and just have equal representation for everything.
Speaker 1: So what you're really saying is that the social lives of the black and white students were still very, very divided.
Speaker 2: Yeah--well yes and no because I think that we for those of us who were active, I don't think there was a big color separation or racial separation rather.  I played sports with white kids.  One of my best friends--he's passed away now--was a white kid named Juan Jessen (ph.).  So for some of us it wasn't a big deal, but I think for systemically race was still big and race was still part of the school's dynamic.  As I said, we had--the fact that we had a black principal and a white principal tells you that right there that there was some kind of compromise that had to be set in the '60s [1960s] or '70s [1970s] to make the school work because this school obviously during integration--when integration came the black kids who went to Booker T. Washington [Rocky Mount, North Carolina] were bused to Rocky Mount Senior High School and it became Rocky Mount Senior High School, and they actually did a pretty good job because there was never any violence.  There was never any protests or anything like that.  The kids all kind of got along even merged the colors.  They merged the mascots to make the Gryphon, but they had left these kind of things in place to have--"Okay, we're gonna have black queens and we're gonna have white queens."  I don't think we had black and white presidents but we did have that queen structure and the principal structure.
Story_ID: 159262
Speaker 1: So on the verge of graduation [from Rocky Mount High School, Rocky Mount, North Carolina] what kind of counseling did you get for college?
Speaker 2: None. I got absolutely no counseling, and I, I imagine that I'm probably being hard on my guidance counselors, but I didn't get any.  I was the first person in my immediate family to go to college so I was on my own a lot.  But you're seeking official counseling from my guidance counselors was not--was not something they seemed to be very interested in.
Speaker 1: Were they black--were there any black guidance counselors? Well not that they had to be, but I'm just saying.
Speaker 2: Well we had--I'm pretty sure we did but whoever my guidance counselor was, was white because we had the same guidance counselor throughout our high school career.
Speaker 1: He didn't advise you to go to college or about what college to go to?
Speaker 2: I can't remember him advising me to go to college or not.  I don't think he--I don't think he--no he didn't advise me to go to college.
Speaker 1: When you consider this now as an adult, you're in a high school, you're making A's, you're active, everybody knows you and your guidance counselor doesn't advise you to go to college.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: The principal doesn't--did the principal intervene?
Speaker 2: Well, the principal, Mr. Davis [ph.]--well I mean in terms of--you asked about guidance counselors.
Speaker 1: Yeah but somebody--Mr. Davis.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Mr. Davis, other teachers knew that I was going to go to college.  That was obvious. Like I said that was always obvious but in terms of guidance--official guidance from a guidance counselor who was suppose to help you with applications and financial aid and things like that was pretty much nonexistent for me.  So you know I would probably run my applications by him but it wasn't any kind of help that he was giving me or advice that he was giving me.  I remember him telling me some school like East Carolina [University, Greenville, North Carolina] about he didn't think I would make it there or get into East Carolina. I'm like you know--I don't know.  So I immediately kind of separated myself from the process--the official process and did it on my own or help from teachers like Mr. Davis or other--my homeroom teacher Ms. Batts [ph.] who helped me with the applications and things like that and there was a guy at the former high school, Booker T. Washington High School [Rocky Mount, North Carolina] had become a place called the OIC, the Occupational something.  It's called the OIC [Opportunities Industrialization Center] of the Booker T. Washington [Community] Center and they had--they would have--there's a recreational center and they would also have kind of community outreach programs.
Speaker 1: Sullivan's--Reverend [Leon] Sullivan's group [Opportunities Industrialization Centers] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: So they would have social outreach programs and one of them was helping kids get into college.  So I actually took my "college recruitment" outside of my high school.  Well not necessarily my recruitment but the help that I needed, the advice that I needed I got that from the OIC and this guy named Mr. Gillum (ph.) who helped me with my financial aid papers, my applications.  All of that stuff that my guidance counselor should have been doing.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright Mr. Gillum. I know a Gillum it wasn't Virgus Gillum was it?
Speaker 2: No his name was James Gillum, no, no that's, that's a football player.  I forgot what his first name was. Mr. Gillum, everybody knew him.  He helped a lot of people get into college.
Speaker 1: Yeah 'cause the Gillum I knew is--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah, I don't think he was in North Carolina.
Story_ID: 159263
Speaker 1: North Carolina Central [University, Durham, North Carolina] was the school.  That was your choice.  Did, did you have a choice amongst schools?
Speaker 2: Well yeah, several choices that I was--several schools I was considering.  East Carolina [University, Greenville, North Carolina] but actually it's a funny story that Mr. Gillum [ph.]--I had actually chosen North Carolina A&T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina]. I was going to go to North Carolina A&T and it was pretty much--I wanted to attend a historically black college [HBCU] because I thought that that would be the best path for me in terms of what I wanted to do and who I wanted to develop as a person.  I thought an HBCU would be perfect for me so I chose North Carolina A&T and I wanted to major in English and literature.  So I talked to Mr. Gillum about it and he was like well--I came to Mr. Gillum to get the financial aid packages. I had already been accepted, and I had been accepted to A&T and several other schools, East Carolina, UNC [University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina] and he said, "Where are you going to go," and I said, "North Carolina A&T," and he said, "Well, why are you going to go there?" and I said, "Well I'm gonna major in English."  And he said, "Why are you going to A&T?" and I said, "well, I don't know."  That was part of the problem of not getting guidance because I didn't know.  I just wanted to go to A&T because A&T was a black college and everybody talked about it.  So he gets on the phone and calls North Carolina Central while I'm sitting there in his office, and he calls a woman named Nancy Rowland who was the director of admissions and he says I've got this kid who's a pretty good student at Rocky Mount Senior High [School, North Carolina] which everybody knew what Rocky Mount Senior High was in North Carolina.  So they knew it was a good school that had produced good students.  Rocky Mount had a good track record at North Carolina Central of sending students there and while I'm sitting there in his office he's telling Dr.--Ms. Rowland that he has a student that he's going to send to Central who makes good grades who wants to major in English and we got a financial package for him.  He's coming to Central, and as I'm sitting there I never applied to Central. I'm pretty much accepted over the phone.  Walking into his office fifteen minutes earlier I have no inclination about going to Central at all but here it is fifteen minutes later and I'm going to Central--to North Carolina Central.  A school that I had never even set foot on but I did know that there were a lot of older students from Rocky Mount Senior High, black students who had gone there.  So I knew, I knew about it but I never really thought about it and I said okay, I'll go there.  So it was just that quick that I just decided I was going to go to North Carolina Central.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just at the spur of the moment.
Speaker 1: Alright, this is 1985, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I graduated from high school in 1985.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 159264
Speaker 1: So 1985 now this is as Stevie Wonder's campaign of you know, the birthday thing [to make Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday a national holiday]--the reason that I'm raising this is because you, you've you have covered a lot of the [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] fam- family.  Were you thinking about that at all in those days?  Were you thinking about the, what the, about the King holiday and about--
Speaker 2: I think a little bit. Not a lot.  I mean obviously Martin Luther King was someone whose presence was always big in my life.  I wasn't around--I was born a year before he died so I never really kind of fully embraced who he was because he was this figure in the past.  But I think that around that time in 1985 I was probably getting a little bit more political.  So the Martin Luther King holiday thing was something that was starting to raise itself on my radar.  In 1984, of course, is when [HM] Jesse Jackson ran for president for the first time and in '88 [1988].  So those things were kind of coming to bear for me.  I can't recall how deeply involved I was on the King holiday considering I was in North Carolina not here in Atlanta [Georgia] at that point but I was really, really interested in what Jesse Jackson was doing when he was running for president in '84 [1984] and '88 [1988].
Speaker 1: Okay yeah the '84 [1984] run, I mean he was able to--he had tremendous presence on the campaign trail.  Nobody felt that he had a chance.
Speaker 2: Oh no.
Speaker 1: Not even black people.  They didn't feel he had a chance but he was able to raise issues.
Speaker 2: He was able to--I think he won--I can't remember if that was when he won South Carolina or was that in '88 [1988] or '84 [1984] but you know--
Speaker 1: I think it was '84 [1984].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it might have been '84 [1984].  So yeah that was kind of one of those times where you go okay a black guy is running for president.  He's out on the national scene.  This is something I'm interested in.  I remember going to see him speak at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Rocky Mount [North Carolina] in '84 [1984], I guess '83 [1983], '84 [1984] when he was running for president so that was huge.
Speaker 1: What intrigued you about it?
Speaker 2: That he was an disciple of Martin Luther King.  That he was a great speaker and that he was a black man running for president who, while he was not given a great chance, he did seemingly have a shot.  He was out there on the scene so he was one of the top three or four Democratic candidates, I believe.  So we felt as young African Americans at that time that here's a person who could legitimately have a shot at becoming the president of the United States and who is a guy who we kind of know.  Who we've seen, we've kind of grew up with, who is from the South. He went to A&T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] for a little while.  So he was a guy who was one of us or not one of us but you know kind of one of us who was on this national stage doing some very important things.  So that's why I gravitated toward him.
Speaker 1: Did North Carolina of sort of claim him?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, of sure yeah, I mean he was--like I said he went to North Carolina A&T I think for maybe one or two years.  He is from South Carolina, of course.  So yeah North Carolina claimed him very big time.  I remember when I was in college [at North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina] in '88 [1988] when he ran in '88 [1988] he would come during the campaign.  The first time I voted for president was in '88 [1988] and I voted for--in the primary for Jesse Jackson because he was the guy and did we think he was going to win in '88 [1988]?  I think '88 [1988] was [Michael] Dukakis?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, did we think he was going to win, probably not but you know this is Jesse Jackson.  He's one of us, he's a HBCU [Historically Black College or University] grad, he's from South Carolina, he's a brother so you know, we were going to go out and support him.
Speaker 1: How did he compare do you think on the stump with the other candidates?
Speaker 2: Well at that point when you're in college you look for different things and we looked for presence and appearance and excitement and Jesse Jackson on the stump is--no one had a better presence, no one was more exciting, no one spoke better than Jesse Jackson.  I mean you know look at him and Dukakis now.  It's like night and day.  If you're looking at it from that standpoint, you're like how did this guy lose to Dukakis in the primary.  So that's what we saw and we saw also a black man.  Someone who looked like us who came from the same place we did and we were very excited about that.  Whenever he would come to campus it would just be a madhouse and I remember he had this big voter registration thing and we all went out and voted for him.  I remember 'cause I was on--this is in '88 [1988] I remember he came and I was, you know, the editor of the newspaper [Campus Echo] and myself and a woman named Sonya Laws who was Ms. NCCU presented him with a NCCU [North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina] jacket and I have this great photograph of me putting the jacket on him, you know.  So you know, he was just a great figure in all of our lives.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Particularly in the, in the, in the, in the '80s [1980s].
Story_ID: 159265
Speaker 1: Now the name of the paper was the Campus Echo, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay and what--so did--who were some of your teachers and mentors at North Carolina Central [University, Durham, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Wow I had a lot.  In terms of journalism you had Kip Branch, Tom Scheft and Tom Evans.  They were my journalism professors and they all did great jobs in teaching me the craft.  Luther P. Jackson came over as a visiting professor from Columbia University [New York, New York] to teach journalism, but in terms of the English literature Patsy Perry, Arthurell[D.] Sanders, Phyllis Lotchin [ph.], Muriel [Jackson] Mellown.  In terms of speech, Dr. [Waltz] Maynor, Dr. [Phyllis] Randall, Dr. Chambers, Ken Chambers.  So I had--I went to speak at Central in 2009 and they were all there.  All my professors from the English Department were there to watch me speak which is kind of cool but they all played a huge role in my life in terms of--you know people talk about historically black colleges kind of provided that nurturing environment for you and they do.  These professors in the English Department were just great.  They weren't all black either so that should be said that you know they saw a lot in their students and they wanted their students to do well and I think in that we saw that they wanted us to do well and we've always appreciated that and I've always appreciated that.  All of those people that I've named I'm still very close to and talk to every now and then.  Kip Branch who's--when I was NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] vice president we were able to honor Kip Branch as the college journalism professor of the year, one year.  So he meant a lot to me.  He tried to get me into Columbia University.  He had graduated from Columbia University and wanted me to go there after I graduated from college so he played a huge role in my development as a reporter, as a journalist and as a student.
Story_ID: 159266
Speaker 1: Were there any sig- significant news stories on the campus when you were there [at North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: We covered a lot of national politics because obviously as I said that was a big time for national politics.  [HM Louis] Farrakhan [Sr.] came on campus a couple of times. Farrakhan was big.  We had at that particular point when I was editor of the paper [Campus Echo] we had a very contentious--well first of all one thing about my college paper was that we had total freedom to do whatever we wanted to do which is very rare at black colleges.  A lot of times black college student newspapers come across from the administrative standpoint as being nuisances to be dealt with and to be propaganda machines for the university.  We were never that.  We could always do whatever we wanted to do.  So we wrote stories about rape, about corruption on campus.  We wrote--we had a very contentious board of trustees and we would write very in-depth stories about how the board of trustees was dysfunctional and never get in trouble for it except for the board of trustees who wanted us kicked off campus.  So we were an independent newspaper.  We weren't independent in the sense that we were--that we funded ourselves--the school still funded us but we could do whatever we wanted to.  So we never had any fears of offending anybody or suppressing the truth.  So whatever was news there was what we wrote about.  Dorms crumbling, cafeter- bad cafeteria food whatever we wrote--whatever we saw, we wrote and they still do.  The Campus Echo is one of best, one of the best weekly newspapers in the country right now in terms of college newspapers and it still is because of that independence that we have.
Speaker 1: Now did you develop your journalistic philosophy at North Carolina Central?
Speaker 2: I probably did, I mean if you step back a little bit I--when I was in high school [at Rocky Mount High School, Rocky Mount, North Carolina] I wrote for the local newspapers.  The Rocky Mount Telegram that was a local newspaper in Rocky Mount [North Carolina], and I wrote for them.  I would cover sports stories. I would cover--write football and basketball stories for them.
Speaker 1: Now this is the general paper for the community?
Speaker 2: That's for the whole, yeah, I wrote for the--my high school paper but I also wrote for the daily newspaper.  That was my first job writing for the daily newspaper.  So I would cover--we--it was a small town so we probably only had two sports writers.  So when we would have a road game, I would write the story.  I would basically write the story about the Gryphons playing Wilson Fike [Ralph Fike High School, Wilson, North Carolina] or Northern Nash [High School, Rocky Mount, North Carolina] or whatever in football and type it up and I don't even remember how I sent it in, or I may have called it in.  So I got my first taste of newspaper writing professionally in high school.  Then when I went to college learning from Kip Branch and Tom Scheft and Tom Evans, I kind of learned the craft of journalism, how to write a proper lead, how to interview people properly because before I was just kind of doing it haphazardly or just basically trial by error but I kind of learned how to do it in college by these three guys who taught me how to do it.  So that's kind of probably where I got my philosophy from these--from--in college from these three gentlemen.
Speaker 1: Okay now you really didn't have--did you have a journalism major at North Carolina Central or?
Speaker 2: No we have one now.  There is a school of communications now at the school but no we did not have one.  We had the school newspaper but we had--we, my major was English literature, and I wrote for the school newspaper.
Story_ID: 159267
Speaker 1: Now why English literature instead of American literature? Was there any reason?
Speaker 2: Well I, I've always enjoyed English literature.  I've always enjoyed Shakespeare and that and American literature was going to be part of it as well so American literature was kind of a minor in the English literature major.  So yeah we read all of Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes, William Wright all those wonderful artists--wonderful authors, but we also read 'Tartuffe' and Shakespeare and 'Beowulf' and all those things.  So I just liked English literature.  It was different, but I learned--but I'm probably equally abreast of both of them, English and American.
Speaker 1: Now you said you like history too.  Did you take many history courses in college [at North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: No I think I just basically took the required courses because we had so many classes to take in English.  Once you start getting into your major and I had--we did have journalism track courses as well.  So between the English literature courses, the American literature courses, the journalism courses that left very little time for history so to speak, so but I did take the history courses, you know, "American History to 1863," and "American History from 1863," and, "The Black Experience," I think was another class that I took.  So I did take a share of 'em but most of my classes were in English--the English department.
Story_ID: 159268
Speaker 1: Now, now did you have any significant internships or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, 1988 I was walking past a bulletin board and I had never heard of the National Association of Black Journalists [NABJ] and Kip Branch who I mentioned before said, "Hey you should apply for this internship with the National Association of Black Journalists," and I'm like, "what is that," and he was like, "it's a journalism organization," and I applied for it and I got it.  It was like the first year that the NABJ had opened up their internship programs to a big class.  So I was one of twelve students from across the country who were chosen and I kind of applied on the fly and I got it and I got a chance to go back to New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I got an internship sponsored by NABJ, funded by NABJ to work for Gannett Westchester Newspapers and I worked in their Yonkers [New York] office.  So I lived in Yonkers.  No I lived in Whiteville [Whitesville, New York].  No, where did I live, Manhattanville, I lived in Manhattanville, New York.  I went to--I stayed at Manhattanville College [Purchase, New York] during that summer which is in Purchase, New York which is not, you know, probably about twenty minutes from New York City.  So I would go see my relatives every now and then who still lived in Brooklyn [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that was that first--my internship. That was my first and only internship was in New York City or in Yonkers.
Speaker 1: Now did you get a chance to do any foreign travel in college?
Speaker 2: No, not in college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Story_ID: 159269
Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduation [from North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina] did you have like--were you sure you wanted to be a journalist or did you want to teach English literature or what?
Speaker 2: No, no I knew I was going to be a journalist.  Well, I knew I was going to be a journalist because after my internship I got a job.  So after my internship I had a very successful ten week stint in New York.  I covered the [New York] Yankees, I covered desegregation of the school system.  The Yonkers [New York] school system was going under desegregation.
Speaker 1: So this is NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] internship?
Speaker 2: It was a NABJ internship but they put you--NABJ selected you and they put you in different places or different newspapers across the country would select you.  So I went to Gannett Westchester.  So I had a pretty good ten week stint there and they said well look, once you graduate, it was a different time, they said once you graduate if you want to come back to us you can come back.  So I go back to college for my senior year, and I know that I have a job after I graduate from college and I go back to Gannett Westchester after I graduate from college.
Speaker 1: Okay so you came out in eighty--
Speaker 2: Ninety [1990].
Speaker 1: 1990, I'm sorry. 1990 and anything significant about graduation?
Speaker 2: It was a great day (laughter).  It was a great accomplishment, I think, just to kind of finally graduate from college to achieve a dream that I had since I was a kid.  To know that I was the first person in my direct family to go to college and graduate from college and then graduate from a historically black college [HBCU] that had some--with a bunch of--I mean to go to a historically black college and to say that I'm going to be the first person in my family to graduate from college is not rare.  So I'm there with a lot of other kids who are in the same boat that I'm in who had the same circumstances that I had--that I was in or worse and to see us all kind of get this and to achieve this and graduate was special and it's something that's always special and dear to me.  Being able to graduate from college--begin able to graduate from a college like North Carolina Central University where I had the best years of my life, I think.  I met all my really good friends there, I pledged there, I learned a lot about myself there, you know.  My best friend from high school [Rocky Mount High School, Rocky Mount, North Carolina] was my roommate for four years.  We graduated together.  So it was a perfect situation there the whole time.
Story_ID: 159270
Speaker 1: So after graduation [from North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina] you, you go to Westchester [County], New York?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And work in--so what was going on.  What role did you play when you showed up [at Gannett Westchester Newspapers]?
Speaker 2: Well when I went to Westchester?  I was just kind of like the low man on the totem pole (laugher).  At that point I was--it was my first professional job.  I worked--I wasn't in the Yonkers [New York] office anymore. I was in the White Plains [New York] office and I covered the town of Tuckahoe [New York].  The town of Tuckahoe and the villages of Scarsdale [New York] and Bronxville [New York] and these are very, very affluent communities in Westchester County.  Westchester County is one of the most affluent counties in the world or in the country, at least.  So I was there covering these very affluent villages.
Speaker 1: How did that feel being in the--
Speaker 2: It was difficult at first because I'm kind of like a fish out of water coming from a historically black college [HBCU] even coming from Brooklyn [New York] to North--rural or not rural, suburban North Carolina from a black college to this ultra rich society of Westchester County covering government and municipalities there.  It was a culture shock somewhat but I think I was prepared for it.  So I looked at it as a job, but I saw myself doing different things.  I don't want to say that I was not impressed with my first job because I was, but I didn't see myself covering rich communities the rest of my life in New York City [New York]--outside of New York City.
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of the paper again?
Speaker 2: Gannett Westchester Newspapers.  Gannett Westchester was kind of the parent company and it had newspapers and all the--it was weird because they had newspapers in all the different cities in Westchester County.  So there was the Herald [Statesman, later The Journal News], there was the Daily Yonkers and the Herald Statesman.  All these different newspapers--all these different towns had different newspapers but they were all the same newspaper.  It was kind of weird they just had different mastheads.  So I worked for the--and they just had different layouts but it was all the same content.
Speaker 1: Slightly tweaked at all in terms of--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Slightly tweaked, yeah, yeah.  So I worked in the White Plains office covering these--this town and these two villages.
Speaker 1: So was there a philosophy that they were just covering certain kinds of news or were they--
Speaker 2: No it was just basically just kind of churning it out.  It was kind of the old model of newspaper coverage, just kind of churning it out.  So I knew every--I covered these whole--I covered everything so I knew when I had city council meetings or town hall meetings. I knew when I had school board meetings.  So I would basically be in charge and it was good experience because they kind of threw me in there saying you're in charge of this area so you cover it all.  So it was a learning experience and I learned how to cover government, I learned how to cover schools, I learned how to cover school boards, I learned how to cover crime.  I had to go every morning and check out the crime reports.  I had to go every Tuesday night to school board meetings, every Wednesday night to city council meetings.  So it was a very diverse existence, but it was also very good because it was enriching that I was able to kind of learn all this kind of stuff on my own.  And yeah I did, I kind of learned it all on my own.  I was the youngest guy in the office.
Speaker 1: Were you the only black student--or person (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: No, I had a black editor, Lawrence Ehring [ph.] and there was another black reporter there as well.  But yeah it was a bureau. I was in the White Plains bureau and there were a couple of black people there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was definitely the youngest person there.
Speaker 1: Alright, okay.  So okay, so but you were there like two years?
Speaker 2: Two years, yeah.
Story_ID: 159271
Speaker 1: Then you went back home to North Carolina, right to, to Durham [North Carolina] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah as I said working in New York [for Westchester Gannett Newspapers] at that time was not and I was probably a little bit more ambitious than I probably should have been at that early age.  When you're young you think you--I was writing--I was the man working for my college newspaper and I thought I should have been the man working for my first newspaper job in New York City [New York] or outside of New York City and I wasn't.  So I was writing briefs that the city council shifted money from one department to another.  That was kind of the extent of the news that I was covering or high school graduations.  So I felt I wanted something different so I went back to North Carolina to cover higher education for the Herald Sun in Durham, North Carolina which is where I went to college.  So I was kind of going back home to cover a familiar area to be in a town that I knew very well that had a lot of people that I knew so I was kind of going back home.  So it was kind of the perfect situation for me and a lot of people say in the newspaper business you kind of go up.  You go from small town to bigger town to a bigger town to a big city.  I went from a big city, Westchester County, New York outside of New York [City] and if I had stayed there who knows where I would be now.  But I went from this big city and I went back down because I thought it was a better job and it was a better opportunity for me.  So sometimes you've got to go where your heart takes you and where you think your life will be best so I went from New York to Durham.
Speaker 1: So this is the Herald Sun in Durham, right?  You covered higher education so you covered colleges there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I pretty much covered historically black colleges [HBCUs] across the state.  We had a reporter who covered UNC [University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina] and public schools.  We had a reporter who covered Duke University [Durham, North Carolina] a guy named David Folkenflik who is now the media correspondent for National Public Radio [NPR].  He and I were hired the same day.  He covered Duke University and kind of private schools, and I covered North Carolina Central [University, Durham, North Carolina] and historically black colleges.  We had eleven historically black colleges in North Carolina, five of which are public so I was that guy.  So North Carolina Central and all of the educational activities that happened around HBCUs I was in charge of.
Speaker 1: Does North Carolina have more black colleges than any, any other state?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: I thought that might be the case.
Speaker 2: Yeah, eleven yeah, so six private so they have a lot.
Story_ID: 159272
Speaker 1: Now this is the year too that [William Jefferson] Bill Clinton wins the presidency.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I don't know how that impacts. I just thought I'd mention that (laughter). In '92 [1992] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: No, no, no that was a pretty significant year, obviously.  He came to--I remember he came to North Carolina Central [University, Durham, North Carolina] when I was there or not while I was there but I was covering it and I met him and I met Hillary [Clinton] and I met--it was funny because all four came.  Hillary, Bill, [Al] Gore and Tipper Gore, they all came and we all sat down for an interview with them.  So yeah that was a huge deal as well.  Just having a--going from twelve years of Republican leadership to Bill Clinton, a Southerner in a Southern state--living in a Southern state who kind of brought a different philosophy and change to the country.  So that was a very exciting time and to get a chance to kind of meet him ever so briefly when I was covering higher education when he came to campus was great.
Speaker 1: So what were the big stories in higher education when you were at the Herald Sun [Durham, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: The big story when I first got there was a big scandal at North Carolina Central about double billing which is kind of weird and it was a professor who I never took or it was a program that I never took so I never even knew the guy.  But that was the big story that was going on at the time.  So I kind of jumped in and covered that.  There was a lot of change going on at North Carolina Central University and there was a lot of change going on for historically black colleges [HBCUs] in general because there was a point where people were questioning whether or not they were relevant or not.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So that became a big overriding theme as to whether or not they were relevant particularly whether or not they were getting funding--adequate funding.  What kind of students they were recruiting and you know just are people still attracted to these schools when you can go to UNC [University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina] or East Carolina [University, Greenville, North Carolina] or North Carolina State [University, Raleigh, North Carolina].  So those were kind of the big overriding themes.  So I was there for five years covering all of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All of that stuff particularly from North Carolina Central University's point of view.
Story_ID: 159273
Speaker 1: In 1995 or '96 [1996] I did this--I won a fellowship with the Education Writers Association to travel the country to write about historically black colleges [HBCU].
Speaker 2: So this is an extension of what you were doing in North Carolina, I guess?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah and you know, the fellowship was basically an extension of my work for the Herald Sun [Durham, North Carolina].  So I was able to take several months off to travel the country to kind of write these bigger, broader stories about historically black colleges and universities.
Speaker 2: Now did you get to all of them?
Speaker 1: No 'cause at that time there was 103 historically black colleges that were recognized by the White House Initiative of Black Colleges [White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities].  So I probably went to thirty-five.  I came down here to Georgia, Virginia, of course, South Carolina, North Carolina, of course, Alabama, Florida, but I went to about thirty-five colleges.  I didn't visit all of them, but I went to certain ones that I would pick up on a theme on or one college may represent something I was writing about that I would go and visit.
Speaker 2: So through this Education Writers Association fellowship you went to these colleges and you--the end product was an article called 'Fighting to Survive: Historically Black Colleges and Universities Face the 21st Century.'  So what did you learn in relation to the questions you raised about whether they're relevant or not and how they're being funded and supported. Are they affective?
Speaker 1: Well I learned that they are relevant and I learned that they are not monolithic and that every historically black college is not the same.  Everyone has different issues, different problems, different strengths, different weaknesses.  Howard University [Washington, D.C.] doesn't have the same problems that North Carolina Central University [Durham, North Carolina] has which doesn't have the same problems that Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia] has or Barber-Scotia [Concord, North Carolina] has.  So they are all different and they all have different set of circumstances, different set of histories and they all should be treated as such.  So in terms of the relevancy, yes they are relevant--they still are relevant because they're still outlets for people who need that place to go.  They're still outlets for people who want to do that.  I think that you can't negate someone wanting to have that experience, not necessarily needing that experience but wanting that experience.  I didn't need a historically black college experience but I wanted one and I think as long as that want is there then there is a relevancy to them.  Now can I go or can any kid go to any college that they want to go to now, sure.  But do you want to go to that college is the question and as long as there is a place for you to go that you can have people who look like you, who have presidents and chancellors who look like you, who have all your classmates look like you, I think that's fine.  I think that's no different from all-women's schools or all religious based schools.  I don't think there is any kind of difference and I think that one thing that I learned is that in terms of democracy, historically black colleges are probably more democratic than majority schools because anybody can come into the school as a freshman and legitimately feel that they can be the editor of the school newspaper or the president of the student body or the queen or the head cheerleader because you're all based--'cause your talents are based on who you are not what you look like or what your color is which I think is probably the point of contention at predominantly white schools is that you can go into a place and have the same qualifications but not a legitimate shot as to achieving these high goals.  When I was at Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts], 2009, 2008 was the first year that and I'm not sure how long The Crimson has been going on, but it was the first year in The Crimson's two hundred years of existence that they had a black editor.  Now you're saying that two hundred years there has not been a black kid qualified to be the editor of the school paper.  So that's what I'm saying, you know.  So I think that, you know, when you go to a black college everyone's on the same playing field.  As long as you can do the work, you can achieve anything there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 159274
Speaker 1: From your, your tour of the black colleges [HBCUs] and from your paper ['Fighting to Survive: Historically Black Colleges and Universities Face the 21st Century'] can you--I know you said they all have different issues and have different origins and that sort of thing but can you generalize about--you know, is there a generalization, I guess that can be made about the problems of black colleges in those days and today?
Speaker 2: Well I think that probably that well it's probably two main problems is leadership.  Getting good leadership is always going to be the key to any good, good development of any college or any institution.  So I think we have to kind of figure out a way to develop good leadership.  I think we are now there's been a really good crop of leaders who have come up now but a lot of the problems that they've inherited have come from bad leadership.  You look at places like Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia] which had horrible leadership now it's basically dead.  There are other, several other colleges around the country who are struggling now based on bad leadership and people are having to come in now and try to clean that up or try to salvage the university in any way they can.  And the second thing is money, is funding.  These schools are not getting the same levels of funding that white schools are getting.  They're not getting the same level of fundings from federally, privately or from alums that other white schools are getting.  So they have a higher overhead based on the fact that they're getting less in.  So we have to figure out a way to kind of reconstruct that funding model.  I think that's probably the key is just getting more money into 'em.  When I covered colleges in North Carolina, as I mentioned there are eleven--there are five black colleges--public black colleges and the funding formula for the sixteen state schools in North Carolina when I was there and I'm pretty sure it's the same way--it's the same now, the five lowest funded schools in the state--public schools in the state were the five historically black colleges and universities.  So that just tells you right there that funding is always going to be down or funding is always never going to be at the levels in which it is.  But you know like--
Speaker 1: It corresponds with political power?
Speaker 2: Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah but North Carolina Central University [Durham, North Carolina] where I went to school when I was there it had five thousand students.  We had one male dorm which is where I lived, Chidley [North Residence] Hall.  Now we have ten thousand students.  We have a whole new campus across the street where we bought all this property.  So there are schools that are doing well.  We're doing well, Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] right here and Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] are doing well.  There is some talk that Howard University [Washington, D.C.] which is the flagship university is doing--is not doing so well financially.  So if Morris Brown College here in Atlanta is just--you drive by that place and you just tear up because it's just--you can't believe what has become of that place because of bad leadership and no money.
Speaker 1: Bishop College, I think down in [Marshall] Texas is closed.
Speaker 2: Knoxville College [Knoxville, Tennessee] has lost its accreditation. I think Knoxville College has lost its accreditation. Yeah because I visited--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] is in trouble I know.
Speaker 2: Yeah Wilberforce, Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] had some trouble even FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] they had accreditation problems.
Speaker 1: Yeah Fayston [ph.] is thinking of selling their art collection.  I think they are still--
Speaker 2: Yeah or Fisk.
Speaker 1: Fisk, yeah Fisk is selling an art collection.
Speaker 2: So yeah when you have to basically try to sell your art collection for a couple of million dollars to kind to keep your school afloat then you know that there is a really, really larger problems there and that's just kind of a bandage to a deeper wound that's there.  I hope these colleges can survive, I think the public schools will survive to some extent.  I think that the larger private schools will survive like the Spelmans and Morehouses and Howards but these small particularly these smaller private schools that are not getting any kind of funding--steady stream of funding are gonna always be suffering.
Story_ID: 159275
Speaker 1: We've, we've been discussing like traditional black colleges [HBCUs] that were formed after Reconstruction as being in jeopardy.  Are there any new black colleges on the horizon?  Is anybody thinking of, you know, creating (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The whole concept--the definition of historically black colleges, college means a college founded before 1964 specifically to educate the sons and daughters of slaves.  So there are technically no new colleges created after 1964.  The last--the newest HBCU, I think is the University of the Virgin Islands [U.S. Virgin Islands] which I think was founded in 1961 or something.  Clark Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia] was founded in 1988 technically but that's because of a merger of two colleges, Clark College [Atlanta, Georgia] and Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia].  So there are no new HBCUs on the horizon because that HBCU name or that HBCU distinct- designation doesn't exist anymore for new colleges.  But you do have, you know, you have colleges that are predominantly black like Atlanta Metro College [Atlanta Metropolitan State College, Atlanta, Georgia] here in Atlanta [Georgia] or Atlanta Tech [Atlanta Technical College, Atlanta, Georgia] that are predominantly black, but they are not historically black.  They just happen to be 90 percent black.
Speaker 1: I think UDC [University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.] got a HBCU designation at a certain point even though it was not really created--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah well UDC was a merger of like several different colleges.  So yeah I think they are one of the newest "HBCUs," but they--that was because they merged all these different little colleges together to create this one college, UDC.
Speaker 1: I guess what I'm getting at is it's hard to change something that's been around for a long, long time and sometimes it's easier to start something fresh that--to address specific needs.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that unfortunately we will lose more HBCUs probably in the future than we will gain just because of the times--the sign of the times and you know as I said you know, Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia] is pretty much gone, Knoxville College [Knoxville, Tennessee] is pretty much gone so.
Story_ID: 159276
Speaker 1: So this is like a landmark event [publication of 'Fighting to Survive: Historically Black Colleges and Universities Face the 21st Century'].  I mean, you're writing this paper--this is the first, I think, real study of HBCUs [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] that had been conducted in a long, long time--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --by any, any investigative writer.
Speaker 2: At that time--at the point it was the largest undertaking of--that any newspaper had taken to look at historically black colleges and I really appreciate the people at the Herald Sun [Durham, North Carolina] giving me that chance and that freedom and that space to kind of do that and the time and effort it took me to travel the country and to come back with this series was very, very special.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was the leadership like at the Herald Sun when you were there?  Who, who--(unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The editor was a guy named Bill Hawkins.  He was kind of the editor.  He was kind of the guy who gave me the go ahead to do it, really good guy.  Bill Stagg was my direct editor.  So these are the guys who kind of gave me free rein to kind of go out there and do that, and they trusted that I could do it 'cause at that point, it was just like, okay we are going to let you out there on your own and kind of do it and I'm still a young guy to be able to go out there and just kind of write on my own and kind of be a freelancer for three or four months travelling the country writing about this.  So they trusted me and they, I think they were pleased with the results. I was pleased with the results.
Speaker 1: Okay the series is nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.
Speaker 2: Yes, I was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, which very fortunate enough--I didn't win (laughter) but it did win--it won pretty much everything else.  It won every state award.  It won several other national awards in terms of from the NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] from other educational based organizations and print organizations.  So it won pretty much everything that it was up for.  It was--although I did this in 1996, it's still probably the best thing I've ever done.  It is probably not the best--I've probably written stories that have been better.  This was a seventeen story series.  I've probably written things that have been better, but in terms of impact and in terms of creating something, this was--I don't think I'll ever duplicate that in a newspaper again, but I did it.
Speaker 1: You were twenty-nine when you wrote, wrote this series--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah I was a kid (laughter).
Story_ID: 159277
Speaker 1: Now '96 [1996] was also the year that the [1996] Summer Olympics were held in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you have any, any responsibilities in terms of the Olympics (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well actually and again I worked for a great paper.  The Herald Sun [Durham, North Carolina] I would never say anything bad about it during my period there because they were always very supportive of me.  At the Herald Sun--there is a guy named Leroy T. Walker, I don't know if you've heard of the name.  He was a chancellor of my university [North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina] when I was a freshman and he's a hall of fame track and field guy and when I was a freshman, they opened up the Walker Complex on campus.  So he's--but to get back to the story, I think in 1996 he was the coach of the US Olympic Track and Field Team [sic, president of the United States Olympic Committee] and he wanted to make sure that North Carolina Central University had a presence at the Olympics so he made sure that we--that Central graduates and Central people were there.  So I was there kind of as a volunteer, working the Olympics.  So I basically took two weeks off from work to go--to come to Atlanta.  I was still working in Durham [North Carolina] to kind of work as a volunteer for the Olympics covering or doing basketball.  I did basketball and a little track while I was here.  So I was off pretty much, I was off the whole two weeks, sixteen days kind of here but I was also here during the bombing of the Centennial Olympic Park.  So I switched from my volunteer role to reporter role.  So I covered the bombing for my paper [the Herald Sun] in Durham, and I found people here obviously who were here in Durham whether athletes or people from Central or who were watching the games or volunteering to write their stories--to tell their stories about being in the park when it bombed--when it blew up or just what that experience was like.  So I did actually kind of work, I volunteered.  So I was here the whole sixteen days, partly as a volunteer and partly as a reporter.  But I was never--they never assigned me to cover the Olympics.
Story_ID: 159278
Speaker 1: Now, you know, I, I started to raise this and it got past me but the fact that North Carolina Central [University, Durham, North Carolina] is a track school.  I know they're a track school--I mean, I know they're a track school in terms of black college sports at North Carolina Central you can almost hear the bell half ring (laughter) when you hear the name (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah we have an incredible track and field program.  We have incredible athletic tradition there.  Basketball we won the 1989 National Championship Division Two.  We just celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the team a couple of weeks ago.  We're the first school in Durham [North Carolina] although Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina] is more like five since then but we were the first team in Durham to win a national championship in basketball.  So we're very proud of our athletic traditions there.  We always had really good football teams, always had good basketball teams and, of course, track and field (simultaneous) with LeRoy Walker.
Speaker 1: Yeah, track and field.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 159279
Speaker 1: Now you joined the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1997, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How did that come about?  Did the [1996 Summer] Olympics [Atlanta, Georgia] have anything to do with that?
Speaker 2: No not all.  I had actually tried 'cause as I mentioned before you kind of start looking, when you're at a paper, you try to start looking for bigger cities and bigger papers to go to.  So I had actually always had my eye set on coming to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and I wanted to come in '96 [1996] or '95 [1995] or whenever before the Olympics so that was kind of my goal, but you know, it was pretty busy. You know, they were--the paper was gearing up for the Olympics and not really hiring a lot of people at that time.  So I didn't get in until 1997.  But there was a guy named James Mallory who was the recruiter at the time in '96 [1996], '95 [1995] who I always kept in touch with.  I would send him my clips and I would talk to him at conventions, NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] conventions about wanting to come here and he said he would always keep me in mind.  After '96 [1996] he said that the Olympics didn't have anything to do with it, but after '96 [1996] the HBCU series ['Fighting to Survive: Historically Black Colleges and Universities Face the 21st Century'] had a lot to do with it.  That got me recognized, noticed everywhere, all over the country so newspapers all over the country were inquiring about me, inviting me up for interviews.  But I always wanted to come to Atlanta [Georgia] so I got several offers--I got several offers right at the same time and I got the offer at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution the same time I got offers at other big papers and I chose Atlanta in '97 [1997] largely because of my relationship with James Mallory.  At that point he was not the recruiter anymore but a woman named Angela Tuck who is editor now, she's education editor now, was the recruiter at that point and we struck up a really good relationship, a good correspondence and they hired me in '97 [1997] right after the '97 [1997] NABJ convention.
Story_ID: 159280
Speaker 1: So NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] was here now?
Speaker 2: No it wasn't here.  It was in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Oh okay, it was at Chicago but okay, it was right after that convention (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah it was in Chicago.  I think it was--yeah it was in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay, when did you start--when were you first involved with NABJ?
Speaker 2: Well, in 1988 when I was an intern.  That was my first knowledge of it.  So that was my first knowledge of it but you know, when I got--when I moved back to--we had--there was a little presence of it in New York when I was there working.  There was a chapter there and I would go to a couple of meetings.  When I moved back to Durham [North Carolina] I started the Triangle Association of Black Journalists.  So I started a chapter there and in '97 [1997] to be honest right after '96 [1996], '97 [1997] right after my series [Fighting to Survive: Historically Black Colleges and Universities Face the 21st Century] and I won a NABJ award, I went to Chicago--the paper flew me out to Chicago to get the award and then at that point, I became a consistent member.  I guess in '97 [1997] in terms of going to all the conventions, being very active in local and national politics of the organization and just being a full fledged member of NABJ.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that came--although I started the chapter--although I started the triangle chapter, but it was '97 [1997] that it really just kind of all came together and I became this full member of it.
Story_ID: 159281
Speaker 1: I know you said James Mallory was here already at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution but what else attracted you to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution?
Speaker 2: Atlanta [Georgia], you know Atlanta at that time was the black mecca, so to speak, Atlanta and Washington, D.C.  It was only five hours away from North Carolina--my home in North Carolina so I can drive quickly.  I had a lot of friends who were moving here and people were always just talking about Atlanta as this place that people were coming to that you can make a lot of money.  There was a big music scene that was coming about that was kind of changing.  Atlanta was becoming a focus of that.  Not that I was a music person but Atlanta was becoming the focus of a lot of things and it was a place that--it was a big city and you know as I said, you always want to go to a bigger city when you work for a newspaper.  So Atlanta was at the top of my list.  It was always at the top of the list and you know New York [City], of course, going back to New York to work in the city.  But Atlanta was a reasonable place that was close and it was kind of southern and I had kind of gotten used to the whole southern thing living in North Carolina so this was the place where I wanted to come.
Speaker 1: Okay what were some of the notable stories that you've been involved in with your writing here in Atlanta?
Speaker 2: Well I've been here since 1997 as you said so that's about seventeen years so I've covered everything.  I came here as a night cops reporter.  So my first job--it's weird because after covering all this great stuff in Durham where you're kind of the big fish in the little pond, you become the little fish here.  So my first job for the first six months was night cops.  So I would come in every day at 3:00 and work until 12:00 until after the news went off covering cops.  Shootings, accidents, traffic jams just you know you name it, I did it.  So I did that for about six months then I moved on to education, covered higher education and then K-12.  So I've basically covered everything at this paper that you can cover.  I've covered cops, education, I've done some sports, I've done some features.  I've done crime, of course, but the thing that I cover that's kind of always been an overriding theme of all my coverage has been race.  I've covered government politics, elections but race has always been kind of the main area that I've become--that I've become an expert in, that a lot of my coverage always kind of goes back to.  So if I'm  covering government or if I'm covering politics and something racial happens or there is a racial or an event that happens or some situation that involves race, I'm usually the guy that gets pulled in to cover that because of my expertise and because of my interest in it.  So with Atlanta being the home of the Civil Rights Movement because of the people who live here.  So I've covered [HM] Joseph Lowery and [HM] C.T. Vivian and Hosea Williams and [HM] Andrew Young and [HM] Fred Shuttlesworth and you know, [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], his life and legacy hovers over all of that.  So I've covered everything about the King legacy since day one.  Since I've gotten here that's kind of been what I've been in charge of doing.  So I'm that guy who covers all of that and it's been great 'cause these are the kind of people when you talk about the history, I've always had a keen interest in history, these are the kind of people I read about growing up.  These are the people that I--and to be able to meet Coretta Scott King and [Andrew] Andy Young and Joseph Lowery--Joseph Lowery performed my wedding.  So these are the kind of people that I've read about who I kind of consider the second founding fathers of the country that I'm covering now on a regular basis who call me every now--it's funny we talked about [HM Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson and my first kind of experience watching his campaign.  You know, Jesse Jackson has my cell phone number and I--sometimes I look on my phone and I see, oh man Jesse's calling and I don't have time to talk to him right now (laughter).  You know what I'm saying so it's kind of weird that you know, this guy that you grew up idolizing now becomes kind of a peer or someone that you kind of can, you know, feel comfortable talking to and kind of reaching out to and, and associating yourself with.
Story_ID: 159282
Speaker 1: Okay, so race--here we are 2014 and race is still a factor in this country and we're in Georgia here--Atlanta, Georgia which is still seen as a mecca for black people, businesswise and in fact, one young person described it as black Hollywood now.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: The movie industry is here and you know what I'm talking about?
Speaker 2: Real Housewives?
Speaker 1: No, no not the Real Housewives but--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Tyler Perry?
Speaker 1: Tyler Perry, Tyler Perry.
Speaker 2: Yeah it's kind of had a shift from kind of the music to Hollywood, to black Hollywood.  Atlanta and Georgia has huge tax incentives to shoot here--to shoot films here.  So every movie--you go to any movie and you see backgrounds of Atlanta whether the movie takes place in San Diego [California] or Florida or whatever.  It's shot in Atlanta.  And there is always--I live in downtown Atlanta and this really kind of funky little neighborhood and there's--every night I go by--I go home there is a movie truck shooting something.  So it's kind of like little Hollywood.  It's a place where people have come to kind of try to make their fortune.  We have a really strong black political base here started by Maynard Jackson in 1971, 1972 which has still gone forth through Kasim Reed who is the youngest--who is a young man who is in his forty who's the mayor--who is in his forties who is the mayor now.  So there is always been that strong African American presence here.  Does racism exist, sure but Atlanta, I think, is a place that you can come to and as an African American and if you're willing to work and if you have the right connections, the right job, you can do well here.  I don't advise people moving here because I've seen it a lot.  People move here without a job or without any kind of support system and they flame out.  You can't do that anywhere especially not in this day and time.  So but if you come here with the right attitude and the right job, the right connections, you can do well here for a little while at least (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 159283
Speaker 1: Now who, who was mayor [of Atlanta, Georgia] when you arrived?  Was it--
Speaker 2: When I arrived?  [William] Bill Campbell was the mayor and Bill Campbell--it was interesting because I was--my first year here was also the 1997 election and you talk about coming to a big city and that was a very exciting election.  It was a very contentious election.  He was running against a guy named [HM] Marvin Arrington [Sr.] who was the president of the [Atlanta] City Council at the time.  That election taught me a lot about big city politics which is totally different from what I was seeing in Durham [North Carolina] in terms of political campaigns and political maneuvering.  Bill Campbell won but Bill Campbell faced his own troubles later on.  Then Shirley Franklin became mayor.  She became the first female mayor of the city also a black woman in 2001.
Speaker 1: Right and--
Speaker 2: And now we have Kasim [Reed].
Speaker 1: So did you cover the, these elections?
Speaker 2: I did not cover the '97 [1997] election because I had just moved here and we had a huge staff and we had obviously people.  But I did cover Shirley Franklin's 2001 campaign.  She ran against Rob Pitts. I covered that.  I covered her 2005 campaign was kind of--she ran against a non-opponent so I covered that, and I covered the 2009 campaign that Kasim Reed against Mary Norwood.  So I covered his first campaign as well as his second campaign.  So, I guess, from 2000 until now I've covered every mayoral campaign in the city.
Speaker 1: So in your opinion what's the condition of black political strength in Atlanta today as opposed to when you came?
Speaker 2: That's a great question.  I think it's still very strong but the political strength may be changing.  Kasim Reed barely won in 2001--was it, no 2009 I'm sorry.  He barely won in 2009 against a white opponent.  He won by like three hundred votes [sic, seven hundred] and the person he ran against ran a very formidable campaign that was very--wasn't very well-funded or wasn't very well-organized.  I think a lot of people would admit, but she did, she did lose by only a couple hundred votes. So people are predicting that in the next couple cycles, election cycles that there may be a political shift in which we may see another white mayor or a white mayor for the first time since 1969.  So that may be something that's on the horizon, we don't know.  There are a lot of people--you know this is Kasim Reed's second term and there are a lot of people in the pipeline who are ready to come in and take over, a lot of young black politicians, but there are also some white politicians out there as well who are seeing this opportunity as an open seat to come and challenge this and there's--like the neighborhood that I live in Castleberry [Hill, Atlanta, Georgia], used to be a black neighborhood. It used to be a black kind of industrial kind of neighborhood, but now it's become this kind of funky cool neighborhood with art galleries and restaurants and all this stuff and white people are moving into that neighborhood that used to be all black.  All these black neighborhoods around town that used to be all black are now becoming white, and they're becoming mixed.  So you have more white people moving into town and that's changing the political mix.  It's changing the political mix of the schools, it's changing the districts in terms of political council districts.  There are more gays coming into town or the gay population or the gay political voice is becoming stronger in the city.  So in the next election who knows who will be the mayor.  It's going to be an open seat so it's kind of wide open.  It could be anybody, it could be a black female, it could be a white female, it could be a gay man. Who knows?  If you ask me to predict I would imagine it would still be an African American but as some point there will be a change in Atlanta.  There will be a political change.  Whether or not it will change the culture of the city is a different story, but there will be a political change at some point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But there also may be another political change statewide because as I said Kasim Reed is leaving but he's seeking higher office or he has higher aspirations to become senator or the governor.  So you may whereas Atlanta may see its last black mayor, the state may see its first black governor.  So you have these things that are shifting tide.
Speaker 1: Is that possible in Georgia in terms of the numbers to have a black--
Speaker 2: Well it hasn't been possible before. [HM Andrew] Andy Young ran for senate and the governor, I believe and Andy Young is as popular as anybody and didn't even get close.  Kasim Reed, if there is anybody right now that you can point a finger to who could have statewide appeal is Kasim Reed. But you never know.  I mean Atlanta is like the hub of the African American vote in the state and everything else is white and Republican.  So if Kasim--if anyone can do it right now, it's Kasim Reed but--
Speaker 1: [HM] Steen King Miles is running for [U.S.] Senate now against Sam Nunn's daughter [Michelle Nunn] whoever that is.  Do you think she stands much of a chance?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head) no is this part on the record (laughter)?  No that's a Republican seat that's been held--I can't remember which seat that is.  I don't know if that's Saxby's [Saxby Chambliss] seat or--I can't remember whose seat it is but it's going to be tough for even Michelle Nunn to win that seat.  Jason Carter is running for governor. He's Jimmy Carter's grandson and you know, Jimmy Carter's grandson, it's going to be tough for him to win a statewide election because he's a Democrat.  So it's not only race but it's also party and Georgia's since probably 2001 has become this red state and the [Georgia] House [of Representatives] is Republican, the [Georgia State] Senate is Republican, the governor's mansion is Republican so it's kind of hard to kind of break into that.  So it's not necessarily a black, white thing, it's kind of a Republican, Democrat thing.
Speaker 1: Well the Republicans tend to be mostly white, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah but when you look at names like Jason Carter and Michelle Nunn who are legacies, whose parents are legends and you know, you would think that they would win without their parents' names but you know, even for them it's going to be difficult to break through that ceiling.
Story_ID: 159284
Speaker 1: I want to ask you now, you, you have covered the family of [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King, Jr.?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The, the children and his widow [Coretta Scott King] and her struggles to preserve his legacy and to--there's a crisis in 2001 and you appeared on Morning Edition to discuss the controversy around Martin Luther King, III ascending to the leadership of SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I guess you kind of intimated that if he wasn't Dr. King's son he would never be in the position to do that.
Speaker 2: Well I'm not sure if I said that or I probably did (laughter).  There's been so much stuff about the--that I've covered about the Kings since I moved here [Atlanta, Georgia].  The King family has for me been the primary source of my coverage as I said. They've been the overriding source of my coverage since I've been here.  So I've pretty much covered every aspect of their lives.  I covered Mrs. King. I met her.  It was an honor to have met and covered her.  I covered her funeral which I think to this point was probably the biggest event I've ever covered in my life.  Her funeral, Rosa Parks' funeral, James Brown's funeral, but Rosa--I mean, Coretta Scott King's funeral was just this amazing display of humanity.  So I've covered the family extensively, every aspect of their lives since I've pretty much been here and every day something new happens.  So I think that the 2001 incident you talk about was when Martin [Luther King, III] left the SCLC, I believe.  He had a tumultuous time there.  He had been appointed the SCLC president, obviously because you know, his father was the founder of the SCLC.  His father is Martin Luther King, Jr., and it was time for Martin Luther King, III to assume the ranks of his father's organization and he had a horrible time there.  Probably part of it brought on by himself but part of it brought on by a changing dynamic that saw a shift of the SCLC's power from the presidency to the board of trustees with [HM] Raleigh Trammel.  People like that who from day one tried to get him out of there.  So he had a horrible time there and he eventually left.  The SCLC subsequently has not fared well since then.  It's had its ups and downs as you can imagine.  It hasn't really had any kind of ups.  Well there were several ups but since [HM] Joseph Lowery retired in 1997, the SCLC has kind of been a nonentity, so to speak and it's been--had these fits and starts of several leaderships.  [HM] C.T. Vivian was the president for a while. [HM] Fred Shuttlesworth was the president for a while.  Charles Steele [Jr.] is the president now.  So you had all these people who were coming in and kind of shuffling in and out of the presidency since that. And Martin Luther King, III's presidency could have been significant, I think 'cause he's young, he had some good ideas, but I think he was just overwhelmed with the prospect of leading this organization and overwhelmed with the presence of the board of trustees and the people who were trying to get him out.
Speaker 1: Now SCLC came together as like a--sort of a confederation of ministers working on civil rights--actively working on civil rights issues.  They were doing demonstrations, sit ins--
Speaker 2: Well basically, 1957 Martin Luther King needed an organizational base to do his work.  So he founded the Southern Leadership Conference right here in Atlanta [Georgia] or it was founded in New Orleans [Louisiana], but it was based here in Atlanta and it was founded by him and Ralph Abernathy and Fred Shuttlesworth, Joe Lowery and all these great ministers to kind of give themselves a base.  You had SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], you had CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], you had the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], of course, you had all these other organizations, but SCLC was King's organization and he led it until his death in 1968 then Abernathy took over and then Abernathy ran for office and Joe Lowery took over for twenty years from '77 [1977] until '97 [1997].  So that was kind of the heyday of the organization between '57 [1957] and '97 [1997] that first thirty, forty years.  Then afterwards it kind of fell into kind of a little bit of disarray.
Speaker 1: Is there not still a need for the SCLC?
Speaker 2: Well I think there's still a need.  There can still be a need for the SCLC.  We don't--we no longer have CORE.  Well I guess we do still have CORE.  We no longer have SNCC, for example.  I think there is a need for it, but I think it has to be the right need for it or I think it has to have to serve a certain purpose and I'm not sure if the SCLC serves a certain purpose now.  The NAACP is still active and still relevant and is still doing things and it still has a national stage to do things on and SCLC doesn't anymore and I don't know--you know, I don't know, maybe it's an organization that has outlived its course.  After--maybe it outlived its course after the death of Martin Luther King, Jr., but we do know that over the last twenty years or so that it has veered off not veered off necessarily in an evil way but it's kind of lost its way and you have to wonder whether or not it's relevant or not in today's society because I can't see where it's raising money. I can't see where it is particularly helping people on a national grand scale.  Maybe some local chapters are doing things but I can't see where there's been something that's happened nationally and the SCLC has had a huge hand in it--has had a huge hand in--has had a huge voice in some national appeal for something whether it's Trayvon Martin or you know, profiling or whatever.  I just don't see them doing anything.
Speaker 1: So we still have issues but SCLC doesn't seem to be on top of those issues.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Story_ID: 159285
Speaker 1: The other factor, I mean, I guess the core of what--you've covered the King family and their activities and you know, [Reverend] Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.] is often profiled you know, on television as someone trying to love everybody and that sort of thing but he was an activist, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He shook things up. He challenged authority and that has not been the activities of the King family since he passed away (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: No, and well, I look at that in two different ways, is that sometimes I think that the King family is probably unfairly labeled or I think they take an unfair burden of trying to--or having to be their father.  If you really look at the four kids, Yolanda [King] died in 2007.  If you look at the four kids or three who are left, they have that burden of not really knowing their father.  Yolanda was four years old [sic, twelve years old] when he died. Yolanda's the youngest [sic, oldest].  So they didn't really know their father.  They were raised by a single mother [Coretta Scott King] like so many African American kids are now and they have had that burden of living up to their father's legacy.  Now on the other hand that they--I don't think that they have--I think that on one hand that they've tried to accept that legacy and it's been very heavy on them and they've done things that have made them look bad.  All the stuff that you are going to probably ask me about are the things that have made them look bad and as a reporter who covers them, I'm--it's my job to kind of bring that out.  Not necessarily make them look bad but just to kind of chronicle what they're doing.
Speaker 1: They're under a microscope--
Speaker 2: They're under an intense--
Speaker 1: --All the time because of who they are.
Speaker 2: In America, aside from the Kennedys, the King family is probably the biggest family in the country in terms of recognition and notoriety and name recognition and whatever they do, whenever they sneeze or they try to do something, we're going to write about it.
Speaker 1: And it's not just national or local, it's international.
Speaker 2: It's international, yeah oh yeah.  The controversy now and I don't know if you were going to ask about it is that there's an attempt by the brothers--right now Coretta Scott King died in 2006. I covered her funeral.  Yolanda died in 2007. I covered her funeral and since then the remaining siblings have had this kind of--and I've covered--this kind of dysfunctional public relationship where they have kind of fought for control over the rights of King's legacy.
Speaker 1: Let me go back to--I referred to this before we started.  We interviewed [HM] Calvin Morris, Reverend Calvin Morris who is now in Chicago [Illinois] maybe seven, eight years ago.  Calvin Morris is the first director of The [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] Center [for Nonviolent Social Change] and he really basically said he wanted to make it an activist organization.  A continuation of the activism of Dr. King, but he was basically thwarted by the King family who wanted to not--they didn't yearn for the days when they were in constant trouble.  They wanted to talk about what Dr. King did but not necessarily do it.
Speaker 2: I think that one of their hurdles is that they kind of--if you listen to them and you listen to their talk--listen to them talk, it's a lot of parodying of what Dr. King said.  A lot of, "Dr. King did this, he did that, this is how we should be living" and I think that they at some point need to have someone in their--or someone in their circle who can tell them how they can live modern or how they can develop their platforms in a modern way to raise money, to develop programs that are going to further the message that they're talking about 'cause right now it's basically just a message and it's not being carried forth.  It's just kind of the message.  Here's the message.  This is what Dr. King said.  This is the King way of nonviolence and here it is, but how do you move that forward and when you have constant fights over money, over property, over possessions and over the rights of this person then that just diminishes what you're--whatever you're trying to do and it just makes you look a certain way in the public eye.
Story_ID: 159286
Speaker 1: From the outside and just reading the articles and even hearing people talk about losing probably including you and [HM] Roland Martin and a lot of other people it seems to me that a lot of the conflict's over money.
Speaker 2: Yeah well they would say no.  They will say it's over other things and that their brother and sister and they fight just like all brothers and sisters but the bottom line is money and control.  In 2009, I wrote a series of stories about how Bernice [King] and Martin Luther King, III were suing Dexter [King] over access to the King estate.  The King estate is a for-profit arm of the family's business that controls the licensing of their family's name.  So they were fighting for control of that because they weren't getting any kind of receipts for that or they didn't know what kind of money was coming in.
Speaker 1: Who is in control of that? I mean, who is in control of that?
Speaker 2: Well technically--well, there's two entities in the King--let's say the King empire is this--look at the King empire.  You have The [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] Center [for Nonviolent Social Change] which is a nonprofit and then you have the King estate which is a for-profit. Right now Bernice is the head of the King Center.  Martin is the head of the King estate.  Now all three of them are on both boards of trustees of both of these organizations.  Whereas they have different presidents they all still control everything, but they have--because they have different presidents who are the same people, they have conflicts so it's kind of weird.  So you have these two siblings suing the third one over control of the King Estate.  Then you have Martin III who comes and joins with Dexter to sue Bernice over property that the King Center has that the King Estate wants.  So it's just like this whole convoluted system of who owns what property and who is entitled to this property. Whereas they all own it, theoretically, it's who is in possession of it and who should be in possession of it and who should dictate what happens to it.  That becomes a problem.
Speaker 1: From what I understand Dexter King and Martin Luther King, III want to acquire property that the King Center has--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --So they can sell it through the King Estate (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: They want to take it--they want to take that property--well there is a 1997 agreement that all heirs to [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King, Jr. had to relinquish their rights to that property to the King Estate.  So that would include papers, intellectual property primarily, and physical property, I would imagine.  So the Bible that--Martin Luther King's travelling Bible which was also used by [HM President] Barack Obama for his 2012 inauguration as well as their physical Nobel Peace Prize are in the physical possession of the King Center and Bernice King.  She has that in her possession.  Her brothers want that at the King Estate so that they can sell it because it has to be sold through the King Estate.  It can't be sold through the King Center.  So they want to take that physical property from her, transfer it to the King Estate so they can sell it.  So that's the latest conflict and Bernice is like, "We're not going to sell my father's Peace Prize" and the irony is that they are fighting over a Peace Prize which is the greatest irony in the world.  This guy--the second black man to win a Nobel Peace Prize, the youngest person to win a Nobel Peace Prize at the time who wins a Nobel Peace Prize for challenging America's system of Jim Crow and segregation and inequality, his kids are in court and there's a hearing tomorrow--well there's a hearing coming up that is going to start the process of determining who this prize belongs to and whether or not these brothers can sell it.
Speaker 1: It cannot be settled in-house? This is kind of an out-of-house--
Speaker 2: It can be, but it's not going to be.  Bernice to her credit is like, "We're not going to sell it" and you know all the King kids have been--you can criticize them all for profiting from their father's name which I would never do because that's their father.  If my father had a stash of money somewhere, I would rather profit from it than or if my father had a stash of something, I would rather profit from it than someone else profit from it.  So I think you can't criticize them for that, you know, but I think that Bernice to her credit is like, you know at some point it goes too far and we go--we've gone too far with this, and you guys are trying to go too far with this to physically sell his property.
Story_ID: 159287
Speaker 1: I know before this story hit in 2013 before the, the year changed over, I think [HM] Harry Belafonte was being sued by the--or was suing them--or was he suing--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Harry Belafonte--
Speaker 1: --how did that work?  Harry Belafonte who had supported the King family with his wealth from the entertainment industry when hardly anybody else would.
Speaker 2: When nobody else.
Speaker 1: The money that paid their rent, bought 'em food--
Speaker 2: Bought 'em food.
Speaker 1: --And sent them to school and everything else.  A lot of it was coming from--
Speaker 2: Harry Belafonte.
Speaker 1: --Harry Belafonte.
Speaker 2: Well they've sued--they've been very litigious--I mean they have--one of the criticisms is their litigiousness and the fact that they have sold like [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King's [Jr.] voice to commercials.  They've sued newspapers and TV shows and movies for using extended clips of his videos. They've blocked things from happening.  There's several movie projects out that are in development now that they've blocked because they won't give the rights to speeches or likenesses, things like that.  There are some documentaries that have been produced that were never out because they wouldn't give that permission without a substantial payment so some of the criticism is well deserved.  They have attempted to sue people who have found things who--there was a former secretary of Dr. King's whose--who Dr. King gave a lot of stuff to and she tried to sell it--I'm not sure if she tried to sell it or what but the King family tried to take her stuff basically saying that it belonged to them.  That everything that King has ever produced belongs to them, and they tried to take this woman's stuff and the federal courts said, "No this belongs to her," and now Harry Belafonte he had two items--I can't remember exactly what they were but he was going to auction them off and use the money to benefit some kind of educational fund or something and they sued him.  So like you said here is a guy who basically supported this family for years after their father died and now these kids are suing him.  Also, you know he didn't, Harry Belafonte--the last time I talked to Harry Belafonte was in 2006 at Coretta Scott King's funeral, which he didn't attend because he was supposed to speak and because [President George W.] Bush was on according to him because Bush was on the program he was taken off the program.  So he's like, you know, "I'm the guy who--"
Speaker 1: 'Cause he had said something that offended the Bush administration (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, so allegedly the Bush--the Bushes were like, "We'll speak but Belafonte is not going to be on" or they took Belafonte off.  Anyway Belafonte, the one person you'd think would have spoken at Coretta Scott King's funeral wasn't even there, and he was very upset about that. So he's had--he was upset with the kids about this.  So now several years later they're suing him for property that was rightfully given to him because he wants to auction it off. So this is the kind of stuff that gives them a bad im- that leaves--gives people a bad impression of who they are but I think at this point though Bernice [King] has said, "Maybe we have gone too far and if we do sell this stuff and if my brothers sell this stuff we have gone over a cliff that we're never going to be able to come back from."
Speaker 1: What do you think--do you think that all of this is--all of this is distracting, I guess, in terms of focusing on the message and works of Dr. King?
Speaker 2: Yeah, especially--you know it's interesting that it's distracting because it comes at a particular time.  The sister, Bernice learned about this on January 20 [2014] which is Martin Luther King [Jr.] Day.  She learned about it on a national holiday that her brothers were going to sell this prize.  On the anniversary of the March on Washington, the very--the same day her brothers filed a lawsuit demanding that she be kicked out of The [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] Center [for Nonviolent Social Change].  So it's just like--I don't know if they're doing this on purpose or not but the symbolism of them picking these two days to publicly take their sister to court is just amazing.  So yes it is very distracting because on these days on which we should be celebrating King and his works, we're writing--I'm writing stories about dysfunction amongst his children so it is very distracting.
Story_ID: 159288
Speaker 1: Do you have a sense of the contributions of the, the King brothers [Martin Luther King, III and Dexter King] to their father's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] legacy at this juncture?  I mean are they--how valuable are they in terms of--
Speaker 2: How valuable are they?
Speaker 1: Yeah to the public in terms of spreading the ideas and legacy of Dr. King?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, all of the King kids, if there is a criticism of them is that their, their, their adult lives have been about their father.  About--we talk about Martin [Luther King, III] being the head of the SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] which is his father's organization.  All the kids have taken turns being president of The [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] Center [for Nonviolent Social Change] or the King estate.  So all of their professional lives have been surrounded by their father or all their professional lives have been encompassed by their father's work for the good or the bad.  They--I guess they haven't developed independent lives amongst themselves of you know doing things amongst themselves, setting their own legacies and agendas.  So it's a difficult question as to how far they've carried their father's legacy because their father's legacy is set--especially here in Atlanta [Georgia], it's always going to be strong despite what the kids do.  I think that their, their, their shortfall is that they have not established legacies of their own that have been significant.  It's all been based on their father's work.
Speaker 1: Do you think as a reporter covering this, do you think that they really--they must sell Dr. King's Bible or the Nobel [Peace] Prize in order to just have enough income to live?  Is that--do they get paid from the--I mean do they get paid? How do they earn their--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so. Well, the King Estate as I mentioned. The King Estate is the financial arm of the organization.  So all of Dr. King's work, his writings, his books or--it's intellectual property that the family owns. So they get royalties on all that stuff and in 2006, I believe, 2006-2007 the City of Atlanta purchased thirty-three million dollars worth of King's papers from the family, thirty-three million dollars-worth of the papers that--physical papers of all of King's writings or most of his writings.
Speaker 1: So what this suggests is that they do have an income stream.
Speaker 2: Yes, they have a large income stream (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well this makes this even sadder.
Speaker 2: So they have an income stream.  They have that bulk thirty-three million dollars and they have a steady income of royalties.  So selling the Pulitzer Prize--selling the Nobel Prize and the Bible are just added to that--on top of that.
Speaker 1: What is the lifestyle of the King children in terms of their--
Speaker 2: I think Bernice [King] pretty much is--Bernice doesn't get paid.  She's the head of the King Center.  She doesn't get paid.  Martin he has a, I guess, a relatively middle class lifestyle. He recently got married, has a daughter, lives well.  Dexter [King] lives in Malibu [California] so we don't know where he lives.  We know he lives in Malibu but we suspect, you know, he doesn't have a job, that we suspect he lives very well out there.  Malibu is probably more expensive living than Atlanta.  So he lives out there.  He just got married.  So I think he is living pretty well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As far as--none of them have a nine-to-five job.  So obviously these royalties and this thirty-three million dollars that they got is doing them well.
Speaker 1: At least the public face of their concerns have to do with selling off pieces of their father's legacy, basically, you know, I mean, I don't--
Speaker 2: And the King Center, you know, I mean the King Center just basically had their salute to greatness dinner which is very well-attended and that's kind of one of the big galas for the year.  They did a pretty good job with that.  Muhammad Ali was honored this year.  He didn't come but his daughter was there. So that's--and I think Bernice to her credit is trying to do the right thing.  I think a lot of people are seeing that Bernice is trying to do the right thing.  She's the youngest.  She's always been considered the brightest or the boldest or the most like her father, and I think she is trying to do the right thing.  So we'll see, you know, we'll just have to see how this all plays out and whether or not she is going to win or not.
Speaker 1: Now in terms of you do you have--do you still have pretty, I guess, ready access to the King family and to--in terms of discussing--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The access, yeah it's pretty good.  I mean it's, it's for this--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I could see them not really liking reporters after some of the things that have gone on.
Speaker 2: Yeah they've been burned by reporters.  We've burned them. I've burned them.  Well I haven't burned them but I've written stuff that they haven't--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well if you tell the truth--you know the articles appear--I haven't seen much to the contrary.  It looks like they're--it doesn't look good.
Speaker 2: They, you know, I still have pretty good access to them.  For this particular story--the access to them comes and goes depending on the wave of the stories, what kind of stories we're writing.  For this story for the latest about the Nobel Prize I have a hundred percent access to Bernice but no access to the brothers.  They are just not talking.  So they may see me somewhere and they say, "You haven't written our side of the story," and I'm like, "Well call me back and then I'll write your side of the story," (laughter).  So I think you've been a reporter, you've done this before a lot of times people think if you don't--if they don't call you back you're not going to write the story or if you don't talk to them then there is no story.  Well you know, you learn very quickly that if you don't talk, you're, you're narrative doesn't get told.  So Bernice has you know, has mastered the media in this whole thing.  She's been out there, she's been on the radio, she's been on NPR [National Public Radio], she's been talking to me so she has gotten the message whereas the brothers they are not talking to anybody and they, they become the bad guy in this whole thing.
Story_ID: 159289
Speaker 1: Well, from, from your perspective what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community in Atlanta [Georgia] today?
Speaker 2: Hopes and concerns, that we you know, we will remain politically active.  That we remain politically strong and viable and that--I think Atlanta kind of sometimes falls into this whole commercialism trap of 'Real Housewives [of Atlanta],' of clamor.  Atlanta has a huge or Atlanta had a huge rate of foreclosure because people are living beyond their means.  Moving to Atlanta, buying these homes, buying these cars they couldn't afford, watching these TV shows, you know people are watching these TV shows of people who are living lives that they can't afford either and thinking that that's what Atlanta is.  I think that if there is anything that I wish we could change is that if there is a real perception of who real black people in Atlanta are and represent--who we represent and who represents us.  It's not what you necessarily see on TV with people with their pants hanging down or living in some--going to all these fancy events and they don't really have a job.  Those are the kind of--I tell people all the time--people ask me all the time do I know these people on TV, who are on these TV shows?  I'm like no because they don't go to the events that I go to.  I go to the real events that you see the mayor at, Shirley Franklin or Tyler Perry. I'm at these events. I don't see these people because they are not real people.  You know what I'm saying? They are not the real people who are the movers and shakers. They are kind of these fake kind of faux Hollywood celebrities that are celebrities that their fifteen minutes have gone on but they don't really represent Atlanta.  One of my coworkers was telling me yesterday about the big gala at Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] Saturday. I wasn't able to attend. I was sick.  But she was telling me about all these people who were there.  These are the--this is the real Atlanta. This is the real black Atlanta in terms of the middle class and the upper middle class that people don't necessarily know because the world is getting a glimpse of another part of this whole black experience.  We have rich culture here, we have rich history here, we have great politics here, we have a good newspaper, we have good media here, a lot of really good black reporters and editors and TV stars--TV reporters here.  Those are the real--that's the real black Atlanta.  And you know we have you know, just these people who have a line brother--fraternity brother here who is from Atlanta and his parents have lived here all their lives, just good solid people. You know, those are the kind of people that, you know, we need to be talking about and focusing on.
Story_ID: 159290
Speaker 1: If you could do anything you wanted to do in the next couple of years, what, what would it be?  Do you have a dream next step?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, I really enjoy working here [at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution].  I enjoy being in a newsroom.  But you know if there's a next step for me it would be somehow in a management position in terms of not necessarily an editor but the editor of the paper.  I want to run the whole thing or I want to go back to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and run the Neiman Foundation [for Journalism, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or go back to Rocky Mount [North Carolina] and be the editor of the Rocky Mount Telegram.  So those are the kind of things that I kind of see myself--I could see myself being a reporter for next five years which I love but in terms of doing something else those are kind of, some of the things that I wouldn't mind doing.
Speaker 1: The title of the piece you wrote when you were a Nieman fellow is really intriguing.
Speaker 2: Which one was that?
Speaker 1: The narrative of the--or the life of. (Unclear) read it back--give it back to us. From Chidley to Harvard.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'From Chidley to Harvard: The Narrative of the Life of An Interesting Fellow.' What is it?
Speaker 1: 'From Chidley to Harvard: The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Ernie Suggs, an African-American, Written by Himself.'
Speaker 2: Yeah, well you know that's from a book.  So that's not my original (laughter).
Speaker 1: It sounds like a lot of the fugitive narratives that were written back in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly. That's from--
Speaker 1: [Frederick] Douglass and a lot of people.
Speaker 2: No it's not Douglass.  It's Olaqundo [ph.] [sic, Olaudah Equiano]?
Speaker 1: Olaudah Equiano.
Speaker 2: Exactly, I can't take credit for that.
Speaker 1: The whole--I guess the 18th century written by himself.
Speaker 2: I think like 'Twelve Years a Slave,' I think that has--I think 'Twelve Years a Slave' like this long title like that as well.  So I kind of wanted to kind of riff on that when I was putting that blog together.
Speaker 1: Okay that's a blog that came out of your Neiman Fellowship, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was--the Neiman Fellowship was a--I got that in 2008 to go study at Harvard for a year and the blog was just part of that experience.  An attempt by me to kind of capture that experience.
Speaker 1: Now you wrote about the [HM President Barack] Obama victory too.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What were your thoughts about the Obama victory in 2008?
Speaker 2: Well I was at Harvard that whole year, 2008 leading up to the election. So I wasn't here, I didn't actually cover it. So I kind of missed covering the election but I was at Harvard the whole time.  It was actually kind of cool to kind of be there, to be somewhere different, to be in an academic environment because we were talking about it every day.  People were--people were talking about it every day in classes and on, you know--people were speaking--speakers were coming and they would talk about it.  We would bring speakers in to talk about it and then on the night of the election to be able to kind of watch this and witness the first African American being elected president and just to kind of go out, spill out onto the streets and celebrate in the middle of Mass Avenue [Massachusetts Avenue] in Boston--in Cambridge, Massachusetts was amazing and just to see all the African students come out with their Nigerian flags and the Kenyan flags, just waving these flags and all these white people, foreigners just out there in the middle of the street just kind of celebrating this historic achievement.  And I had a classmate from Russia who was writing a piece for a Russian newspaper about the election and he quoted me and I told him it was the greatest day in the history of America that this country that was built on slavery could one day elect a black man as president and I just thought it was the greatest day ever.  Just to be there--it would have been kind of cool to cover it but just to be there to not cover it so I can kind of be there as a fan, as a spectator to kind of watch this whole thing unfold was amazing.
Story_ID: 159291
Speaker 1: Tell us something about your family?  Do you have children? Are you married?
Speaker 2: No I'm divorced.  I got divorced in 2009, no children so it's just me.
Speaker 1: Okay, because you mentioned [HM] Rev. Lowery performed the ceremony.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah well he performed--I got married in 2004, and he performed the ceremony. We had a pretty big wedding so to speak.  That kind of typical Atlanta [Georgia] wedding but you know, it just didn't work out so no children not yet.
Speaker 1: And what does your--being the first college graduate in your family what does your family think about your success?
Speaker 2: Oh they are very proud.  Whenever I'm on TV or radio they all kind of gather around and make sure they see it or hear it.  I send them my articles and you know, it's a, it's a--it's interesting how what I did was kind of--I can set the kind of tone--change the tone of my family's course of history.  With me being a college man, kind of setting--changing the agenda and my family's course of history is going to be changed forever for that.  My wife was a college graduate. She had gone to North Carolina Central [University, Durham, North Carolina] as well.  If I ever get married again, she will be a college graduate and my children will go to college no doubt. So we've pretty much changed the course by me and Mike [ph.] going to North Carolina Central kind of changed the course of my family's trajectory so to speak.  So they're very proud and you know, hopefully it can keep going.
Story_ID: 159292
Speaker 1: Today when you look back on everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think just kind of surviving, you know, just kind of making it to--this far, this far.  You know growing up in Brooklyn [New York] and growing up around--you know a lot of people--a lot of kids that I grew up with are probably dead or didn't make it or still there or in jail or something.  I was able to make it out of there, out of Brooklyn.  Getting out of Rocky Mount, North Carolina which is kind of a suburban, rural town. A lot of people are still there, still in Rocky Mount.  So I was able to get out of there and just, maybe about five years ago Rocky Mount was listed as like the poorest city in the country and up until now the murder rate in that town is just gone through the roof.  I think that in 2012 the murder rate in Rocky Mount, North Carolina which is a tiny town is larger than the murder rate of New York City.  And it wasn't that way when I was a kid growing up there.  So to be able to survive Brooklyn and to survive Rocky Mount, I think was a great achievement and to go to college and to know I was going to go to college.  I think that's probably been the best achievement I've done in terms of professionally, I don't know if I've reached my peak yet. As I said, I think I will probably never duplicate the work that I did on the Fighting to Survive series ['Fighting to Survive: Historically Black Colleges and Universities Face the 21st Century'] but I think there's still a lot left in me in terms of other projects, books, other aspirational goals in the media in terms of management, leadership roles.  So I don't know if I've reached my peak yet in that sense.  So I think there is still a lot to do so I would imagine just being here is, is, is a legacy enough for me, surviving being an eagle and an Alpha [Phi Alpha] and all that stuff.
