 Little Thunder My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Thursday, September 24,  2015. I   m interviewing Choctaw artist Patta Butcher for the Oklahoma  Native Artists Project sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral Research History  Program at Oklahoma State University. Patta, you are painter Terry Saul   s  niece and you   re sort of like Oprah in the sense that everybody knows you  by your first name. You   ve been on the Native art circuit for many years,  selling paintings and painted art that   s sometimes abstract and sometimes  draws upon Native motifs. You have a studio at the Artesian Gallery in  Sulphur where you   ve been teaching silk painting for almost a year. Thank  you for taking the time to talk with me. Tell me a bit about your professional  name, Patta LT.  Butcher I   m probably a little late coming into the artist circuit. I really think I was  born an artist. I think my mother has the heart and soul of an artist. Her  name was Lillian Thomas. I was born Patta Lauren Thomas. One of my  funny friends said when I entered the art business, he said,    Oh, you   ve got  to have a cool name.    I thought, okay, I   ll have a cool name. So I shortened  my initials and it became Patta LT and everybody knows me by that. If my  last name shows up, it   s strictly by accident. I always wanted to question  somebody and say,    How did you find my last name?    But it has been very  much a good luck charm for me and so I   ve just kept it. We come from a  long line of women that like to mess with your mind and this does it.  (Laughter)  Little Thunder Where were you born and where did you grow up?  Butcher I was born and raised in McAlester, Oklahoma, and I graduated from  McAlester High School. My mother   my grandmother lived in Tuskahoma,  way down in southeastern Oklahoma. We are members of the Choctaw  Tribe and just have such fond memories of my grandmother and her land. I  was recently at Indian Market, and my sister and I were talking about  (somehow we got off on this thing) we were talking about growing up and  5  playing on the railroad tracks when we were little. We had a summer home  in the forest with moss on the ground and we had a winter playhouse on the  rocks, overlooking the river. The way Mother would call us, she   d either  whistle really loudly or she   d honk the horn and we knew we better be  hauling it back to Grandma   s. I think that gives me my sense of place, my  sense of place.  Little Thunder So you have a sister. Any other siblings?  Butcher I have two sisters. I   m the oldest of three. Our parents have passed away, so  it   s really just the three of us.  Little Thunder What did your mother and father do for a living?  Butcher My father worked at the Naval Ammunition Depot; he was an electrician.  My mother was a registered nurse and worked at both hospitals, St. Mary   s  Hospital and McAlester General Hospital in McAlester and then later  transferred to Lawrence, Kansas. She was the school nurse for Haskell. At  the time, it was Haskell Junior College.  Little Thunder Right. You mentioned your grandmother   s land being a real source of  inspiration. Did you have other family members (of course, your uncle was a  famous painter) but any other family members who were artistic?  Butcher It seems to run all through my family because Uncle Chief   s sons were both  creative. One of them is an art photographer in California and his daughter,  Terri Saul, is a painter. Terri Ann Saul, she is an artist also. Bill   s wife, Sue,  she is an artist also, so artists are sprinkled throughout my family. That was  never an unusual thing in our family. We just had artists in our family. I  remember growing up and going down to my grandmother   s house and  when Uncle Chief would come through, there would always be a basket of  goodies. Little pots or drawings or something like that. He was always  bringing his artwork home to his mother, and those things were just  sprinkled throughout our family.  Little Thunder That was probably your first experience with Native art, it seems.  Butcher Yes, but it was at such a young age that I never really made the association  that it was Native art. This was just art that we did. And coloring books, you  know, all the wonderful coloring books. We had to draw our own pictures.  We didn   t have regular coloring books. To this day, there is nothing that  smells better than opening a box of brand new crayons. The smell of that  wax is just a wonderful childhood memory.  Little Thunder What was your first experience of making art?  6  Butcher I think I was always   I loved cutout paper dolls. I loved clothing from an  early age. I used to cut out paper dolls. I used to draw my doll clothes for  my paper dolls. We used to cut out their clothes from the Sears-Roebuck  catalog and we made the tabs on them and everything. That, to me, was  probably my first instance into it and yet I had a love of fabric and design  very early on. The Sunday afternoon movies was our babysitter. We saw all  those wonderful old movies with the beautiful clothing. That just nurtured  that love that I had for beautiful clothing.  Little Thunder And you got some sewing experience from your mom, or     Butcher My mother, my grandmother. I studied it in school, also. My college degree  at OU, it   s a bachelor of arts degree with   at the time, it was fashion arts,  clothing, and textiles. I started out in nursing at Texas Woman   s University.  My mother was nurse. You always kind of like to follow in your mother   s  footsteps. Then I transferred up to OU and I had the most wonderful advisor.  Her name was Dorothy Killian. She sat me down one day and she said,     Now Patta, you   re just not going to be a nurse,    and I said,    Okay, so what  are we going to do?    She said,    I think you should transfer over into the arts  through home ec.     It had split at the time. It was kind of fashion and then it was kind of  cooking and things like that, and I thought,    Yeah, I   m on there.    (Laughs)  She said,    You can be in fashion, illustration and design.    I thought,     Okay.    I said,    Now who   s going to tell my mother?    She said,    You are.        Okay, we   ll try.    I remember when I told my mother that, I think the first  thing out of her mouth was, she said,    How are you going to make a living?     I remember thinking,    I   m going to do whatever it takes to do this.    So  there really wasn   t any discussion further than that.  Little Thunder Had you had any experiences like in elementary or junior high or high  school that were showing you maybe you needed to use your artistic talents?  Butcher I created and sewed all my old clothing growing up. When I was little-little,  my grandmother taught me to sew on her treadle sewing machine. I must tell  you, I stood there and watched her and thought,    I cannot wait until I am tall  enough for my foot to reach the pedal on that sewing machine.    I loved the  sound of it. I loved the clicking that that treadle made. I loved all of it, and  my grandmother would help us hem our little dresses that we wore to  Revival and all that kind of stuff. I really thought I was a hot trick.  (Laughter) That probably was the early seeds for it. I discovered very  quickly if I knew how to sew my clothes, I could have a lot of it.  Little Thunder What did you do after college, then?  7  Butcher I worked for a men   s clothing store for a while. When that went out of  business, one of my friends   we had done some little something with Lou  Anthony. She said,    If you   ll make these little things, I   ll be sure that you  get paid.    I thought,    Okay, because my house payment is three months past  due, so I   m really hoping you   re telling me the truth.    We did that and one  of my friends after that said,    You know, Patta, you really ought to start  showing at some art shows and start living like that.    I thought,    Great  because I   ve sold all my diamonds and my jewelry and I   m going to need  something that kind of sustains me here.    I did some research and there were  not a lot of art shows at the time for us to show in.  Little Thunder Was this the early    70s?  Butcher This probably was    80s, early    80s. I think the very first art show that I did  was Colorado Indian Market  Denver, Colorado . I started out   I did  these   I always loved the finger weaving. Loved that. I just thought that  was really interesting and challenging. I did a version of that. I did very  large leather and nickel crow bead necklaces, and these were massive. They  came down in the front and the back. I had feathers on the bottom of the  tassels and they were highly decorative.  Little Thunder Almost like, sort of   breastplates?  Butcher It was almost that breastplate version, yet it was mine. Nobody had seen  anything like that, and I really hadn   t either. I don   t know where that came  out of, but it did. The bigger they were, the better I liked it.  Little Thunder What was the reception for them?  Butcher It was wonderful, it was wonderful. People bought up everything that I had.  I did not have a little tiny price on them. I was not going to be shy about  that, because I thought,    Wow, these are hard to do to lace that leather  through those beads and you had to pull it by hand.    It was challenging and I  thought,    I don   t care. We   ll see what happens. If it doesn   t sell, I   ll mark it  down, but this is where we   re going.    I put big price tags on it and they sold.  They sold really well, but I didn   t want to duplicate anything, so that was  wonderful for me also. Somebody says,    Can you make me another one like  this?    I said,    No, I can   t do that because I can   t remember. You get to pick  the color, but that   s it.    I did that for a number of years and just loved it.  Then I began to incorporate my clothing with it. My stepfather came to me  one day and he said,    You know, your mother is probably turning in her  grave because you have not done clothing and that   s what your college  degree is.    I said,    You   re right.     I made up about twelve pieces to come back to Colorado Indian Market.  This market was enormous. I had never seen this many people coming into a  8  convention center to look at art. It was just overwhelming. I had about  twelve pieces of clothing along with my jewelry and things like that. I sold  ten of them the first day, ten of them, and I thought,    Probably onto  something here, Patta. Then I thought,    Well, I can keep going and I can  keep doing that.    One year, I did dresses that had the necklace that went  with it. It was in the same color tones, or it was the skirt and blouse and a  shawl and it had the necklace that went with it and I did the belt that went  with it. Sold through a lot of that. That was closer to looking like Native  clothing and then I     Little Thunder But you   re not painting on anything yet?  Butcher I   m not painting on anything yet. See, I reinvent myself a lot. Then I moved  on to something. I thought,    Well, I   ve got to have something kind of fall  and winter.    That   s when the coats began to appear. I did the beautiful  applique coats that I quilted the linings and I sewed the appliques on them.  Then the Oklahoma City bombing happened somewhere in there and I was  really kind of paralyzed after that. I just couldn   t believe it happened to  begin with. I didn   t know anybody that died in that bombing, but I could not  believe that it happened this close to where I live. I really kind of struggled  with that for a while and I just couldn   t get going. I remember I mentioned it  to Harvey Pratt and Harvey says,    Oh, Patta, you just got to work it out in  your art.    I thought,    Okay.    I mean he was just that matter of fact with me.     Just work it out in your art and get on with it.    And I thought,    Okay, I  will.    So I did. That   s when the big wool   I called them the Aiitaiyokoma  coats. Aiitaiyokoma is Choctaw for puzzle, coats. They looked like pieces of  a puzzle that went together in the coats. I sold them in the heat of the street  in Santa Fe.  Little Thunder At Indian Market?  Butcher At Indian Market.  Little Thunder Was that your first Indian Market?  Butcher No, it wasn   t I   ve been going out to Indian Market for almost twenty-five  years, which makes me close to a hundred by now. (Laughter) I don   t want  to sound like I   m long in the tooth.  Little Thunder To sort of get an understanding, you had this first successful Colorado  Indian Market. You decided to go back. Were you doing shows in between?  Butcher Yes, I   m sure I was, but I probably couldn   t tell you what they were. I  remember when Red Earth first started, I started with them the first year.  Somewhere in there, I started going to the Heard Museum in Phoenix. I did  a couple of shows in Aspen when they were trying to get the new museum  9  opened up. I did Gallup   but in there, I did some fundraising. I did a show  with a friend of mine who was working with the genealogy department in  Pagosa Springs  Colorado . Woyneve Cassidy, she said,    Come up, let   s do  a fashion show and raise some money.       Okay.    (Laughter)  Little Thunder Had you ever done a fashion show before?  Butcher Briefly, briefly. I participated in the ones that Joanne Fullerton did with Red  Earth when they first started out, when she and Madalynne Norick and their  group did them at Red Earth. That was really my venture into a higher  fashion look. I had not seen Native clothing that took on a more  sophisticated flair, which was my love and my passion. My design theory  was really the little Choctaw girl that went to Paris. I wore one of my coats  in Paris in 1995. It was interesting, the reaction. There were men and women  that were driving down the street and they drive on the wrong side of the  road anyway. The woman was pulling on her husband   s arm going,    Look,  look, look.    He   s trying to turn into a light pole and she   s trying to get him  to look at my coat. (Laughter) It seemed like after that, I started seeing the  Paris fashions. They were doing some interesting collections. I think some  of them were showing up at March powwow to kind of get some ideas  because there was a huge influx of Native art clothing about that time. I  don   t know whether I started it or not, but I certainly created a stir.  Little Thunder That   s wonderful. How did you happen to get to Paris? How did that come  about?  Butcher My sister and her husband were in Holland.  Little Thunder Living in Holland?  Butcher Briefly, he was stationed over there. He   s a senior marketing executive out  of Silicon Valley (I think he was with Oracle at the time), and they were  over there for a year. My other two   my other sister and I were invited to go  over there, so we were there about seven or ten days. Amsterdam was kind  of really our point of origin. We would go to different other places from  there, and we spent three or four days in Paris.  Little Thunder What was your first important award? I don   t know that there were  categories necessarily early on in Native fashion.  Butcher There weren   t. I think some of the first awards I won were at Indian Market.  I think I floated in under a textile category somehow. Indian Market had  more categories than I have ever imagined for art. I mean they had a  category for glass when the only glass that was happening at the time was  stained glass. I think that was an important award for me at the time. I also  won an award in a wearable art competition out of Fort Collins, Colorado. I  10  showed out there for several years, but I won a Best of Show out there for  one of my pieces. That was not Native art at all. Not at all. If there was any  Native art that was out there, I was probably the only one.  Little Thunder When did you first get into silk painting?  Butcher Well, I was   my fashion career lasted about maybe ten or fifteen years. I do  that in blocks of time because I couldn   t tell you exactly when it all started  and when it all ended. The switch came one year when we had been to  Indian Market and Norman got like eight inches of rain in six hours or six  inches of rain in eight hours, something like that. My husband had gone with  me and I had clothing at the time. We had a great show at Indian Market, but  we came home and my studio had been flooded. There was carpeting on the  floor and we walked in, you could feel the splashing on the carpet from  where the water had come in. Heat, water, dark, closed up, not a pretty  picture. (Laughs) My husband said,    You know baby, you were thinking  about making a change. This might be the time.    And I thought,    Okay.    I  had taken some silk painting classes. I started     Little Thunder Where did you take them? At OU?  Butcher No, it was a private teacher. I had read about it in the paper. I thought,     Gosh, I always really wanted to do that.    I did some sewing a long time  ago for Lori Bacigalupi of Kiss of the Wolf here in Norman. I started out, I  was one of the first people that did her sewing for her and just loved it. I  thought,    Maybe I can do this one of these days. Might want to make a  change, okay?    You know how it all falls into place for you. I saw the ad in  the paper, six classes, so I signed up, took them, loved it, came back, and I  said,    I   m going to take the advanced classes.    He said,    What   s that?    I  said,    Seven through twelve.    He said,    Sure.    Had a real flair for it. I don   t  measure anything, I dump and pour. Paint comes out right, I don   t waste  very much. Then my teacher pulled together about five of us and we painted  together once a week for six years in a studio situation.  It was a wonderful experience. You   re watching other people, you   re  drawing on lots of things and then everybody had to seriously go to work  and I thought,    Okay.    I had been selling my silk pieces all this time. I  thought,    Well, isn   t this great? People just loving this, buying it.    I thought,     Okay, I   m good to go.    I   ve been painting now for about seventeen years,  and I   ve brought wall art into it. I   m doing wall art. I just made the deal  yesterday to get a real tall upright steamer, so I   m going to do yardage. I  think clothing is coming back into my life again. Everything kind of comes  full-circle, but to me it   s still about clothes and the art. Yet the scarves have  been such a wonderful addition. I get too much joy helping women: showing  them how to tie it, helping them pick it out. Everybody says,    I just don   t  11  know how to tie a scarf.       Sit here with me   show you about five or six  ways right here.     Think about it. This is one way that you can make your wardrobe go a really  long way. All you have to do is change your jewelry, change your  accessories, and that black dress will go to work four days a week. And they  loved it, but they loved it more because I could show them how to wear it.  It   s not any fun to buy something and you don   t know how to wear it. I was  going to show you how to wear it. That   s still part of my clothing design  training. I   m going to show you how to wear it so that you really do enjoy it  more. Have a lady customer in Georgia. She bought from me a number of  years ago in Santa Fe Indian Market. Still sell to her. Put those images, those  attachments on the email, send it to her. She says,    Number four in the first  slide. I want number three in the second one, number two in the third one.     That   s kind of the way I   m developing my marketing.  Little Thunder I think you probably answered a key part of this question because a lot of  people were doing painted scarves. I was wondering what made your work  so different.  Butcher I think you   ve got to fall in love with the artist. I think that   s an essential  part of any type of art is to fall in love with your artist first. But I did  different things. People that come to Native art shows love Native art. They  love all the aspects of it, and they love the stories about it. I would tell them  the stories about my work, and how I produced it, what it meant, how they  were going to wear it, how easy it as to take care of, and it was a natural, it  was a natural.  Little Thunder What was the best business advice you got starting out?  Butcher Do it my way.  Little Thunder That you gave yourself?  Butcher That I gave myself permission to do it my way. I was going to do it my way,  I didn   t care. Maybe that   s because I   m the first child. I   m not sure, but  periodically throughout my life, I   ve probably worked for four different  people outside of the home. Most of my life has been involved in art. I  found one common denominator in the workplace out there. If anything is  the downfall, it   s they want you to do it the same way every time. I   m an  artist, and I can   t do it the same way twice. Tell me what you want done and  let me figure out all these different ways that I can have a good time doing it  and I   ll get you to the same place. I just don   t want to do it the same way  every time.  Little Thunder What is one of the most fun places you   ve traveled with your art?  12  Butcher Gosh, they   re all fun and there   s probably a scary story that goes along with  nearly all of them. I don   t know, probably it   s Phoenix. Probably Phoenix is  the most fun place that I go to.  Little Thunder What do you like about it?  Butcher That my sister has a home out there. (Laughs) I have my own bed (Laughs),  but that   s just been recently. I   ve stayed with friends and I have lovely  friends out there. I like the climate out there. The first of March, it   s warm.  You get to get out of the cold in Oklahoma. I like that.  Little Thunder What is one of your, I guess, best or worst show memories?  Butcher Best and worst are the same; best and worst are the same. A number of years  ago, it was Santa Fe Indian Market and it was early Saturday morning and I  was up on Lincoln Street. I   m not sure how many people realize how Santa  Fe is laid out, but I was up on Lincoln Street and I had shared a booth with  another woman. SWAIA  Southwest Association for Indian Arts  had come  by and they wanted to take pictures of everybody and they kind of lined us  up next to our work and that later became badges that we would wear. I  could see people gathering out of the corner of my eye. They were kind of  gathering behind the photographer as they snapped three or four pictures.  They   d move your scarves and reposition you to kind of get the best look.  After they moved on, those people moved into my booth and by two o   clock  in the afternoon, I was down to one large sarong. I had never seen anything  like that. I had plenty of inventory and this was Saturday.  The lady that I was sharing with, she said,    Patta, I   ve never seen anything  like this.    I said,    I know. I haven   t either. I don   t know what I   m going to  do about tomorrow. I just have one piece left.    She said,    Just take your  sign, and go check out and leave.    I said,    Oh, okay.    At the very last  minute a lady came to me, and you can always tell when they   re going to  buy something. They just have a look in their eyes and they   re just walking  right toward you like a tractor beam is drawing them in, and they   re pulling  out their credit card or their money. They   re looking at you, and they   re  taking the scarf, and they   re putting it on, and they   re looking on the mirror,  and they   re on their way. I thought,    Wow.    So I waited until about three  thirty or four, and I took my sign down. I went down and I turned in my  paperwork.  I said,    Am I going to lose my spot next year?       Oh no, you won   t. If you   re  juried back in we   ll put you in the same spot up there,    they said.     Congratulations.    I thought,    Thank you.    I was so elated for like a couple  of weeks. I thought,    Oh, my gosh I   ve had a sellout show.    Then reality hit  me. It was like,    Oh my gosh, I   ve sold everything that I have.    You have to  13  begin to start over to build your inventory again. I thought,    I   ve got to have  a better plan here.    That   s when I decided that I was going to have plenty of  inventory. Now I had a lot at the time, but apparently that was not enough  for that particular time. So now I really   I am very productive, I paint every  day, and I have plenty of inventory going to a show. Somebody says,    Don   t  you want to sell out?       No, I   ve done that.    (Laughter)  Little Thunder Done that experience. I understand you work on Habotai silk pretty much  when you   re painting.  Butcher Yes.  Little Thunder Can you tell us what that is and why you like using it?  Butcher Habotai is   you may hear of the name China  mommes . It is a very   it   s a  lighter weight silk. Silk is measured in what they call mommes and this is an  eight or ten momme and it   s a very lightweight silk. I like the hand of it  and     Little Thunder That   s a neat term. Does it mean just the feel?  Butcher The feel of it. All that textile stuff, you can   t get that out of me. (Laughs). I  also did a lot of work in silk crepe. That has characteristics to it that I like,  but most of the work is done in Habotai silk.  Little Thunder Did you ever have a storefront?  Butcher No, never did want one, never did want one. The Internet has not been  around forever, and my dream a long time ago was to be able to create and  sell my work from anywhere. Now I didn   t know how I was going to do  that, but that was a dream that I had. Then the Internet happens. Goodness  sakes, FedEx and UPS can stop at the door every day. That was really just  kind of what I wanted to do. I never wanted to have a storefront. I was a  floral designer for a while and the one thing you can   t do and leave is the  cooler and go out of town because that thing will quit while you   re gone. I  wanted my life to be easy. I didn   t want to be nailed down to it. I just  wanted that freedom.  Little Thunder How did you become interested in sarongs?  Butcher The many different ways that you can tie them and wear them.  Little Thunder Maybe we should explain, just briefly, what a sarong is.  Butcher Sarongs   the measurement on a sarong is about a 42   , 45   , by 72   . So  that   s what? A yard and a half by six feet. It seems to be enough fabric that  14  you can wrap and tie into a skirt. You can tie it up and you can make it into  a jacket, and you can throw it over your shoulders and wear it as a shawl. It  really is kind of that one-stop-shop item that I don   t think you should ever  be without. In the Habotai silks you can fold them up and put them in the  handbag, in your handbag, or in your briefcase, in your luggage, and you   re  good to go for a lot of occasions, lot of occasions.  Little Thunder Wearable art is kind of a challenge to display in a booth. How do you  handle that?  Butcher In the past, I had some mannequins and dress forms that were a little  unwieldy to use. I   ve found some that are the half-mannequin now. It comes  with a stand, so the display is probably twelve inches wide and it   s six feet  tall. I can wrap, and tie, and drape around this half-mannequin. It   s very  effective for me. It   s a good teaching aid to show you how you   re going to  wear your scarf or your sarong. It   s vital for wearable art artists. You just  almost can   t go without it. You can kind of get an idea what it looks like  hanging on a hanger, but if you   re talking about a square piece of fabric that  you   re going to wrap and tie and make into a sundress, got to have a little bit  more going.  Little Thunder For sure. What role does Dennis play in your business?  Butcher He babysits the dog and the babies. We have a dog named Molly, and we  have two Manx kitty cats named Jac and Diane, and somebody has to be  home with them. He keeps the home fires going. He has some health issues  right now. He has emphysema, so it   s really very challenging for him to go,  but I remind him how important it is for him to stay here and take care of  things so that I can do the things that I love to do. He   s very happy to do  that. I took him with me to Santa Fe with me one year, and I thought he had  a better time than he really did. So I asked him next year, I said,    Well, you  want to go back to Santa Fe next year?    He said,    No.    I said,    No?    He  said,    No, that is too much work. I don   t know how you do it. That   s a lot of  work. I don   t ever want to do that.       You mean you don   t want to buy the  RV and we can run up and down the highway and sell art?    He said,    No, I  don   t want to do that.    (Laughter)  Little Thunder How do you think the Indian art scene changed from like the    70s to the     80s? I guess you weren   t really working in the    70s too much.  Butcher I wasn   t really working in the    70s too much.  Little Thunder Let   s do    80s to    90s. What were the changes during that decade?  Butcher I don   t know whether it was the    80s to the    90s, but I noticed a shift when  more younger Native artists were coming on, and they were doing their  15  version of Native art. Now it might   ve been the Ninja Turtles with  traditional attire done, or it might   ve been   Ninja Turtles weren   t around  then, but it was probably the Peter Max. Maybe Peter Max with all the  colors he did. They did it Peter Max, Native style, but truly 180 degrees  from traditional, 180 degrees.  Little Thunder In 1990, the Indian Arts and Crafts Act was passed requiring artists to be  enrolled with their tribes or certified by their tribes. What impacts did you  see?  Butcher Those that were not, it was challenging for them. I didn   t have any issues  because I had all of my paperwork and documentation. I couldn   t understand  why there was such an upheaval for it. Even today, (I said something to  somebody) I asked an artist, I said,    Are you going to show in this show?     He said,    No, I can   t do that because I   m not federally recognized.    I  thought,    Oh.    So I said something to somebody else that was putting on a  show, I said,    Why are we discriminating against those that have and those  who have not paperwork? I think the quick answer was,    We get federal  money for doing some of this.    I thought,    Really? Do we need it?    I  thought, we   ve got to quit discriminating against our own people. We   ve got  to stop that as artists. They   re artists.  Little Thunder How has the Native art scene changed from the 2000s to now?  Butcher I think there   s a more established art circuit for young artists to come into. I  think the categories are broader for artists to show and develop in. I think  that   s one of the biggest changes.  Little Thunder Lots of wearable art categories now.  Butcher Yeah, a few more, a few more. Years ago there were none, but there   s a few  more. There   s a few more now. I think they call it contemporary fashion,  and I   m happy to see that. I   m happy to see that.  Little Thunder The Chickasaws seem to really be promoting their artists and Native art in  general. How has that helped you?  Butcher I teach down there at the Artesian Gallery. I have a studio space down there.  I think Governor Anoatubby decided that it was important to do that. I have  to applaud him for that. We   re grateful that Chickasaw Nation has a lot of  money to put toward the arts. The cultural center down there is amazing, but  I think in ten years it   s going to be unbelievable. I think he thinks it   s as  important as we think it is.  Little Thunder What was most surprising to you about teaching? Any discoveries that you  made?  16  Butcher That I was terrified. (Laughs) Mark Milligan with Arts and Humanities  down in Chickasaw Nation, he and Lona Barrick had been courting me to  come down there, really, and to show in some of the galleries. Establish a  gallery or something like that. I thought,    I really don   t want my work in the  casino because of all the smoke.    I really hadn   t been down to see the  Artesian Galleries and studios. Then a year ago on Memorial Day, I did the  show down there.  Little Thunder The Southeastern  Art Show and  Market? SEASAM?  Butcher No, it wasn   t SEASAM     Little Thunder Oh, it was the Artesian show.  Butcher It was just the Artesian show and this was the second year for it. Mark said,     Come let me show you this building. We   d love to have your scarves in the  gallery.    I thought,    Okay.    He said,    Come let me show you this.    He  opened   there was a great big teaching room down there, but I tell you the  hook that got me was the two sinks with hot and cold running water. I know  that sounds shallow, but if you   re working in textiles and a lot of water, you  really need that. He said,    Why don   t you think about teaching down here?     I thought,    I don   t know whether I   ve got anything to say.    He said,     You   ve always got plenty to say, Patta.    I thought,    Well, I guess I do.    I  wrote them a proposal and told them what I wanted, how I wanted to set it  up, I needed to get paid. They think it   s important that artists get paid, so we  were on the same page there. I wrote this proposal to them and they said,  yes. We knew we wanted this to be an outreach to the community and to the  tribe to expose you to new art forms.  We really didn   t realize that it was going to take off and be as successful as  it is. My classes meet twice a month, and I   m booked full until the end of  February   I mean, end of December. We   ve even had to divide classes. I  now have an advanced group, which is always something that you hope for,  that you will connect with somebody that is as passionate about it as I am,  and sure enough, I did. I have nurtured them; I have moved them along. I  have taught them more advanced ways in silk painting. Now they are a  group unto themselves and they come over once a month. We   ve divided it  up. We have beginner students in the mornings. I have an advanced group  once a month in the afternoon, and we split the second day up to two  different beginning classes.  I think I get more out of it than they do. We laugh, we have a great time.  They leave with a beautiful product that they can be proud of, and they can  wear, and they can talk about to their friends. I don   t have to fill the classes.  That   s their job and they do that. They do it really well. They have an  17  amazing team that works down there and they like each other, they work  well together. It   s a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful atmosphere. I   m  thrilled. I   m just thrilled beyond belief how successful this has become for  other people to enjoy this art form that I   m passionate about.  Little Thunder That is wonderful. How much of your work revolves around commissions?  Butcher None. Don   t do them. Don   t care. Not going to do it. Out of 400 scarves if  you can   t find something that you love, I   m not your girl. (Laughter)  Little Thunder What   s an exciting project that you have coming up or perhaps another  clothing item that   s new that you   re tackling?  Butcher I   m going to get back into some wearable things. Maybe some jackets,  something like that. I   m really looking to expand some of my wall art, too,  but I really think clothing is coming back into my life to do.  Little Thunder That   ll be fun to see. Let   s talk about your process and your techniques a  little more. I imagine you use special fabric paints or dyes?  Butcher I use a dye. I use two different kinds. I use a silk dye that has the viscosity of  ink. I use a pigment dye, which is an acrylic, but it   s a very liquid acrylic  that does not need to be steamed. The silk dye does need to be steamed set  for permanence, so that you can wash it.  Little Thunder How would you describe your palette? And what are some of the influences  on your choice of color?  Butcher I paint with limited number of dyes. I paint with about five or six colors and  I mix everything else. I very quickly discovered that I like color better than  anybody and you have to be really careful, or pretty soon you send off this  order and it   s  1,000 and you can   t make the house payment. (Laughter) I  also discovered the beauty of mixing the dyes. You get an undertone of  color in there and I think they   re prettier. I think if you use dyes directly out  of the bottle, you are missing the boat on some other layers of color that  come out and will work. I use a limited number.  Little Thunder Which is a painter   s approach pretty much, too.  Butcher I think so. I think so.  Little Thunder When I heard that you had had a background in floral arrangements, I  thought   because for me you have a very floral palette, too. Do you use a  brush at all? For example, on your silver     18  Butcher I do strictly brushes. I don   t dip anything or vat dye anything. I paint all of  the color on with a brush. My frame is very much like your grandmother   s  quilting frame, only mine adjusts to a narrow width, and it will expand. My  husband made it for me when I started out fifteen, seventeen years ago. I   m  still using those frames, but I can paint up to nine feet, which is three yards  of fabric. I   m still using those frames all those years. I explained to him I  said,    I need this to happen to make this work this way, to add on to this.     He understood how to do that, being a carpenter by trade. He knew how to  do it. He made me the most amazing frames.  Little Thunder Now are the brushes you use, are they special fabric brushes or are they  paintbrushes?  Butcher Paintbrushes.  Little Thunder In all widths.  Butcher All widths. My favorite ones I bought not long ago and the hair on them is  squirrel. They are wrapped and I had never used anything like that. I bought  them and they came in a set, but three sets were a hundred dollars. I thought  this is so expensive I don   t know whether I can use it or not, but I did. I  think brushes make the difference. I think brushes make a big difference. It   s  like watercolor paper. You can get the student grade or you can get the  really good stuff. I like to do the really good stuff because you never know  when that   s going to be a masterpiece.  Little Thunder Do you use stencils at times?  Butcher I do, and I made my own. When I first   I used stencils in my clothing  designs. I had cut them out of sponges. This was years and years and years  ago, right when computers were coming in. I went with some friends of  mine that were teachers to one of their conferences.    Come on, let   s go.  We   ll have lunch and all this kind of stuff.    So I walked out of this  convention and I had an armload of mousepads. Somebody said,    What are  you going to do with all of those? You don   t even have a computer.    I said,     I don   t know, but I just felt like I had to have them.    What I did was, I cut  my stencils out of these mousepads. I would fix (Laughter) a safety pin on  the back of it so I could dip it into the dye and I could transfer it onto my  silk and I used them for years. These were designs that I used on my  clothing and then I moved over and I transferred them. So many of my  images come from way back with me. I don   t ever really give anything up. I  just kind of reinvent some things with it. (Laughs)  Little Thunder Find a new use for it.  19  Butcher The teachers were looking at it and they      Oh my God, this is such a great  idea.    I said,    Yeah, you can take it and teach your kids to do it on brown  paper bags.    They thought,    Oh my God, we   ve never thought of that.     Little Thunder Do you ever sketch anything out on paper for your paintings? For example,  your silk paintings?  Butcher Rarely. Rarely. If it   s an idea I see some place, I   ll take a picture of it on my  phone. I don   t want to waste that time doing it   the sketch and all that kind  of stuff. Because I   m kind of obsessive. Then I think I have to finish out the  sketch, and I don   t want to do that. I took draping and fashion illustration at  the same time in college. My draping is better than my fashion illustration,  but my descriptive powers are amazing. It may be stick people, but there   s a  paragraph written of what it   s supposed to look like. You go with your  strength.  Little Thunder Right. What kinds of research do you do for designs?  Butcher Early on I was looking at a lot of really old, old, old things. One year, I was  at Colorado Indian Market, and a man named Dick Conn was at the museum  in Denver and I met him. He let me get behind the doors and the walls to see  those collections, and he didn   t know me from Adam. Walked up, told him  who I was, what I was doing, and would he let me in? He said,    Sure, I   ll  get somebody to go with you to do that.    They showed me all this historical  and traditional clothing that Native people wore. Then I even went further  back. There are images of Mayan influence and things like that. There was a  whole series that I did on sterling. That came from that. Very early on. The  men, of course, were still more elaborate than the women, always. It   s  always the way it works.  It works in birds; it works in men. But the men wore these fabulous  hammered pieces of metal and I think it was copper at the time and copper   s  making a resurgence now. I thought,    Wouldn   t that be interesting?    So I  did a sterling collection where sterling was part of the clothing. We did a  sterling silver bra and we did feathers where the feathers held the dress on,  and Greg Grey, an Osage silversmith (I think he and his brother Clancy are  two of the finest silversmiths to ever come out of the state of Oklahoma).  Greg was my hands. I did the pattern work, we used a mannequin, and we  got it how we wanted.  Little Thunder It was a collaboration.  Butcher Yes, and it was a wonderful, wonderful collaboration. I took him to the  luncheon at Red Earth to see the fashion show when we showed it. It was  breathtaking. It was so exciting for us. I hadn   t seen anybody doing anything  like that.  20  Little Thunder How fun. What year was this, approximately?  Butcher Probably in the    90s, early    90s.  Little Thunder What is your creative process from the time you get an idea for a design?  Butcher It   s pretty quick. It   s pretty quick. I usually see it in my head and I may  make a quick sketch so that I don   t lose it. I don   t pick out colors at all. I let  my paintbrush lead me on that. It seems to flow out of me, but it comes out  of me very quickly. I think that   s practice because I paint every day. I   m  always in that creative mode. Even now, I have gotten a little more  organization with it and I am organized by colors. If you come into my  studio you see all of the pinks, and then you see the purples, and then you  see the greens, and the reds, and the blacks. Visually, I can see where I need  to add more pieces into a particular color palette in there. It comes out very  quickly.  I   m not big on sketching, particularly since I had to throw all of it away after  it all got wet. I thought,    I   m just not going to do that anymore. I   ll let my  paintbrush lead me.    I   ll do a lot of beautiful backgrounds and then do a  chemical treatment to it, whether it   s salt, Epsom salt, sugar, whatever it is  (alcohol) whatever I want to do. Then go back in and put images over it with  a metallic paint. I love that. I love the bling that brings to it, and yet that   s  very different from wall art that I do. Wall art is definite images. It   s really  kind of two different sides in my brain.  Little Thunder How about how you sign your work? How did you figure out how to do  that?  Butcher I just sign it, Patta LT.  Little Thunder Somewhere on the piece.  Butcher Somewhere on the piece. Sometimes it   s buried in there some place, but  usually it   s right down in the corner and I sign all the pieces unless  something happens and I miss one, but I try to sign all the pieces. (Laughs)  Even my clothing, my clothing label was Dancing Rabbit, designs by Patta  LT. Sometimes I put them on the outside of the clothing, sometimes not. It  just kind of depended on what was going on in the fashion industry at the  time.  Little Thunder Right. I forgot that Dancing Rabbit was yours. Looking back over your  career so far, what has been a fork in the road for you?  21  Butcher Gee, probably been several. I think the fork in the road would come when I  would need to reinvent myself. I always want to stay rel evant . I want  people to enjoy   and I   m sure as we age, so do my design styles. I  remember looking at a piece I had finished for an upcoming show, and it  was tied on a mannequin, and I had creatively tied the scarf on the top. I  thought, yeah, I remember when my body looked like that and remember  when I wore that kind of stuff. It   s not now, but I remember when I did. I  still want my work to be relevant for a long time. I want people to go to it  and say,    Oh, I remember Patta. She   s that lady with that wonderful sense of  humor, and she told me a story about this.    There are men that have bought  my scarves, and I really kind of had to change my delivery on that.  I was talking with a man at Indian Market and he was looking through  things, and I said,    So is this for a significant other in your life?       No, no.     Just really wasn   t giving me any kind of feedback, and I thought,    Well, I   m  going to drag it out of you. I   m determined.    The more he spoke, the more I  realized that he was not from around here, and I finally nailed it down that  he was from the Northeast some place. I was showing him different things  and I was telling him about the scarves and he was kind of looking through a  petroglyph series that I had done. Now I have my own cartoons that run  around in my own little head and those are what shows up on my  petroglyphs. I   ve not crawled around in any caves or anything like that to  get any of those images. Sometimes my dog, Molly, is in my scarf.  Anyway, he was talking and he finally picked one out and I was telling him  about it and I said,    Where are you from?    He said,    I   m from New York. I  work on Wall Street, and I want a power scarf to wear under my topcoat to  work.    I thought,    Okay. For work.    I sold another one to an engineer, and I  thought this was going to be for a significant other and he said,    No, I just  like it and I   m going to buy it.       Okay.    But even my sarongs had to have a  different tune, also, because I   m thinking about how you   re going to wear it  and he   s thinking how he   s going to hang it on the wall. So I thought,    I  need to stop limiting things here and broaden my horizons. I need to up my  game a little bit and be a little more creative in my delivery, so they will feel  comfortable to buy that to put on their wall.  Little Thunder Right. What   s been one of your career highpoints so far?  Butcher That I   m still in the business. That I   m still in the business and I   m grateful  for that every day.  Little Thunder How about a low point?  Butcher Certainly, the floodings in my studios. As I look back on that, I always try to  see where the positive is in it. Because you can be standing there with the  water running across your feet and you   re thinking,    Okay, where   s the  22  good part in this? Like my husband said,    Maybe somebody   s trying to get  you to move. They need to get your attention because you   re not supposed  to be in this space any longer.    I thought,    You know, you   re right,    briefly  forgetting that moving on is not bad, it   s good. There   s better to come, so  that   s been a part of that. And hit the reset button.  Little Thunder Is there anything else you   d like to talk about or we need to add before we  look at a couple examples of your work?  Butcher Gee, I don   t think so. Have we covered everything?  Little Thunder I think we   ve done a good job     Butcher Let me tell you how honored I am that you   ve selected me to do   oh, one  other thing. One of the things that I wanted   I   ve always kept careful  documentation of my work. I recently put together a lot of scarves for a  book about my work and had that printed. I am currently the president of our  Silk Painters Guild of Oklahoma, and I have put together a book of all of our  members    work and I am particularly proud of that.  Little Thunder How cool.  Butcher So we   re almost a coffee table kind of book. (Laughs)  Little Thunder That   s wonderful.  Butcher I think that   s it, but thank you for thinking about me. I was looking through  all the names you have come up with so far and I   m the first clothing  designer that you   ve probably talked to.  Little Thunder Well, I have talked to Margaret Wheeler, Margaret Roach Wheeler.  Butcher I love her.  Little Thunder She   s not online yet, so     Butcher I love her, I met her     Little Thunder There aren   t a lot of you.  Butcher Margaret and I go back twenty-five or thirty years. I was so fascinated by  her work. I just thought she was amazing, and she   s just as loving, and  giving, and sharing. We share studios down in Sulphur. I have one and she  has one. She has the big one. I don   t think I ever got my brain around how  big those looms are because I looked at that and I thought,    Not in a  thousand years would I be able to thread that up and do it.    She is amazing,  23  but I think that is not for me. (Laughter) I love her so, and she   s just been  loving and giving and sharing all these years and I have really cherished that  friendship that we have.  Little Thunder That is great to be close together down there, too. We   re going to pause this  a minute and take a look at your work.  Butcher Okay.  Little Thunder Patta, you want to tell us about this piece?  Butcher The name of this piece is The Place between Today and Tomorrow. It   s on  silk crepe. It   s a sarong. It   s 45    by 72    and this has dragonflies and  lightning bugs and all of those things on it that remind me of my  grandmother   s place     Little Thunder A turtle.  Butcher    the beautiful colors, the turtles. If you need me to move it     24  Little Thunder It   s so beautiful. No, this is great. It   s done on the same kind of silk? Is this a  crepe?  Butcher Silk crepe. The nice thing about silk crepe is that it has a hand to it where it  clings. It   s not slick feeling, but it has a hand where it clings to itself.  Little Thunder And one that you can just throw in a bag.  Butcher Throw in a bag. And I can wrap it.  Little Thunder And here it   s tied a different way.  Butcher Tied a different way. You can put a pair of leggings on with it, go to a  summer dinner out on a patio some place, but you get to see more of the  lightning bugs and dragonflies in it. I still do a lot of my Southeastern  images in all of my work.  Little Thunder That is really neat. All right, Patta, you were going to tell us about this  particular piece.  25  Butcher This is the same sarong that we have wrapped a different way, but we were  talking earlier about the sterling silver bra and the hammered clothing that  our ancient people wore. This is the bra, this is the one that I   ve had all these  years. This is the one that won a national award in a wearable art  competition, and I   m keeping it in my private collection.  Little Thunder Wow, good for you. And the one that Greg collaborated with you?  Butcher And the one with Greg, yes. I always want to get his name in there that we  collaborated on this because he was amazing.  Little Thunder Patta, would you like to tell us about your scarves?  Butcher Yes, the pieces we have laid out on the table, the first one is my Spanish  mustang Choctaw ponies.  Little Thunder They   re great.  Butcher I love them. The Choctaw ponies, the mustangs had a slightly larger head  and smaller body. Some were solid, some were spotted. I do a whole series  of horses.  Little Thunder They   re beautiful.  Butcher This piece also has a chemical treatment of salt underneath it to make the  speckled, splattered look in it. The second one is feathers.  Little Thunder Yes, highlighted with silver.  Butcher Highlighted with silver. The silver is Lumiere, L-U-M-I-E-R-E. It is the  finest iridescent textile paint that I can use. If you make a mistake and put a  26  drop of it some place else, it   s there forever. The next one is batik and the  images are saved with wax. They   re turtles, so you see a slight variation in  the colors on them.  Little Thunder Now we   re looking at something new for you, I guess.  Butcher This is a new series that   s coming out from me. It   s a very graphic black and  white. There were some influences of pottery in there, so these are pottery  designs. Our Southeastern culture, they were always very curvilinear in the  design. Yet, it looks very bold and contemporary to me.  Little Thunder Right. Now is this Habotai silk?  Butcher This is Habotai silk.  Little Thunder Beautiful. Thank you so much for your time today, Patta.  Butcher It has been my pleasure. I have loved this.  -------  -------
