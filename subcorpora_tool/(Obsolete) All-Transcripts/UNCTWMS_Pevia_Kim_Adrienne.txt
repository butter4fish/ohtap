MEG FOSTER: Today is Monday, July 7th. This is Meg Foster with the Moxie Project. And I&#8217;m interviewing Kim Pevia. Is that how you say it?  KIM PEVIA:  Correct.  MF:  In her home in Red Springs, North Carolina. So can you start by telling me a little bit about when and where you were born and grew up?  KP:  Sure. I was born in Baltimore, Maryland September 24th, 1957, and loved it there. We had a little house out in the county, and then a mall was going to be built. So we were renting that house, and they moved us into the city, and we lived in the city for a while, which was really cool because there was an enclave of Indians in the city, and it was the first time I&#8217;d lived around a whole bunch of my people. And then it was around the time that MLK and Kennedy were shot, and there started to be riots in the city. And I can actually remember hearing gunshots when I was laying in the bed, and it was right after that that Dad moved us out to the county and bought a house and moved us out to the county. So we moved away from the Indians in the city, but he felt it was safer to move us out into the county. So I spent most of my teenage years in Baltimore either in the city or in the county.  MF:  What did your parents do?  KP:  My father worked for General Motors, and so he worked on the line and eventually worked himself up to be a maintenance man and loved that because it wasn&#8217;t   as hard as it was in the beginning. And he&#8217;d tell stories about how hard that work was in the beginning. And my mother was a seamstress. She worked for Misty Harper, and I remember being so impressed with her because she didn&#8217;t learn how to drive until I went away for school because I guess then she had to. But for the first part of her life she would take a bus that would take about an hour and a half in brutal cold weather across town to work to make sure that we had what we needed. They were very hard workers, but they were raised here on the farm, so they understood the value of hard work and transferred it to more industrial jobs in Baltimore eventually.   MF:  Did you have any siblings?  KP:  I do. I have two younger brothers. I&#8217;m the oldest and the only girl. And I have a brother who is two years younger than me named James and a brother who is seven years younger than me named Sean. And James [was] in and out of the family a lot. By the time I left to go to college and came back he developed a substance abuse problem and still carries that with him. So we go great periods of time not hearing from him. And recently he was clean for about a year and then fell off the wagon again. So it&#8217;s been a real journey for him and for us and this whole thing of how to support and be strong and all that at the same time.   And then my baby brother Sean is a general manager here at Peterson Toyota and does extremely well and is very well received and loved in the community, and selling cars is not something that most people would love to do. But he loves it. If there&#8217;s such a thing as a calling for selling cars, he does. And because of that he&#8217;s done very well. People come back all the time. So my two siblings.  MF:  Where did you go to school?  KP:  I went to high school at Woodlawn Senior High School in Baltimore, Maryland, and then left to go to Lee College which is now Lee University, which is a Church of God college because my parents at the time were only willing to pay for me to go to a Christian school. And I've always been a rebel of sorts. So I went to the Christian school and stirred things up there. [I] came back with my hair cut and my ears pierced and wearing makeup and pants and all the things that in the Church of God you&#8217;re really not supposed to do, especially way back then. So they thought it was better that I not return to Lee College. [Laughter] So I ended up finishing my education at University of Maryland College Park.  MF:  Oh okay. [Laughter]  KP:  Yeah, every time I tell that story people are like, &#8220;Really?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah,&#8221; I was always a rebel a bit. So yes.   MF: Was there a heavy influence of religion growing up?  KP:  Yes. I was in church Sunday morning, Sunday night Wednesday night, often Saturday afternoon. My parents really were very involved in the Baltimore American Indian Center was well as the church. Those were the two places they did their volunteer work. They helped start the Baltimore Indian Center. And then the youth activity committee, we called it YAC at the church. So they kept us doing things engaged and involved. And it was extremely heavy duty religion. And again I was always a rebellious--. I remember going to high school, and I would leave my house looking very typically Church of God, and by the time I got to high school I had my pants on and my makeup on. [Laughter] So yeah, it was fun, skirting the issue. But I still appreciate the grounding in such a thing. But yes, it was extremely, and still is--. My parents are extremely tied to their faith and to the church, as is my brother. I found other ways to reach for a creator, but that&#8217;s still important to them.  MF:  Was most of the Indian community connected to the church?  KP:  Different ones but yes, church. It&#8217;s really interesting for me. Some of my people actually struggle with Native American spirituality and Christianity and don&#8217;t feel that the two merge. I've found a way to merge the two very easily. But the church has always been extremely important to the Lumbee culture here and in Baltimore. The Baltimore Indian Center used to actually be in the back of the church. It was maintained in the family center of the church for a really long time. That was a Baptist church. But that&#8217;s typically the way the Lumbee culture runs, is along some sort of religious lines--Methodist, Baptist, especially Southern Baptist. And then quite a few adopted Church of God because of the camp meetings that were held here for a really long time.  MF:  What was the role of the Baltimore Indian Center? Was it a resource center or--?  KP:  Yes. And a gathering place and a place to express culture. We would work on regalia and beading and have different people come in and speak, and [it was] a way to gather because we were so--. At that time there were still some of us who were spread out in the county, and there was an exodus from here to different industrial cities around that time. There was always a need for a sense of home and community, and that&#8217;s what the Indian Center provided. There were elder circles that would gather to quilt. It was very intergenerational. I remember it being my salvation a lot when I was younger. The first piece I ever wrote I wrote sitting there, and it was being read in a black and white society because that&#8217;s what Baltimore was. They hadn&#8217;t seen too many Indians, and then we developed this little enclave in Baltimore city that became such a salvation for all of us. I was there a few weeks ago after I returned from DC. We decided to go through there. And I pulled up to that little house in the city and took a picture, and I started weeping. I was like, &#8220;Oh my gosh. I remember being here,&#8221; and all the things that meant because this was home for my family, Robeson County, and dad would always talk about, &#8220;We&#8217;re going home.&#8221; And we did every holiday, every summer. But that was a temporary home until we could get back here.  MF:  What brought you back to Robeson County?  KP:  Me or my parents.   MF:  I guess both.  KP:  Okay. My folks, it was always part of their deal. My parents, when we were young they would bring [us]. Every time we would come, which was every holiday, every summer, every vacation--. We rarely did anything that didn&#8217;t include coming here, and if we did it was visiting family somewhere else, but it was always very family oriented. And they would take us by the piece of land where their home is built now and say, &#8220;This is where we&#8217;re going to retire.&#8221; And they&#8217;d walk us through and [say], &#8220;Your bedroom is going to be here&#8221; and this, that and the other. And we were like, &#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;s just tall grass.&#8221; It was just a piece of land then. We were kids so we didn&#8217;t really know. So certainly as soon as they retired they--. Actually before they retired dad started building the house. So he would come down and work on it, and they built their home here.   For me--and I&#8217;m always fascinated by how life takes you&#8212;this was never in my radar. Actually I was the anti-Robeson County person. I never, ever wanted to live here, ever. I lived in Baltimore, lived in Delaware, lived up and down the eastern seaboard, lived in Florida and was there for fifteen years. And eight years ago I was coming home for different funerals, and I could feel a piece of my spirit being left here. And so I knew I was being called to come back home. And I was not happy. [Laughs] I was angry and like, &#8220;Really, Creator, you&#8217;re going to make me go back there?&#8221; But yes, I knew in my spirit this is where I needed to come and do. Two messages I received. One is, &#8220;Go back home and do what you do in Florida back there.&#8221; And two is that we&#8217;re standing knee deep in a river here and we&#8217;re dying of thirst. So I came back home kicking and screaming eight years ago. But now I love it. I mean I can&#8217;t imagine that I was ever so resistant to coming here. And I thought I came for them, and now I think I came for both, for me too. It&#8217;s been so deeply spiritual and healing for me to be here as well.  MF:  So your whole family is from Robeson County?  KP:  Yes.   MF:  Okay.  KP:  Strong roots here. But then again because of the racial issues when my father returned from the military, he moved his family to Baltimore because he was really afraid, and sometimes I think there might have been a little PTSD. Now we&#8217;re learning words we didn&#8217;t have in the [19]50s, but when he came back from the military and had fought for his country and was not allowed to drink at the water fountains and not allowed to&#8212;. He ordered a soda and couldn&#8217;t sit down and drink it. Right after he returned he said he knew that if he didn&#8217;t get out of here that there was going to be a problem. So he moved his family up there, his family being his wife and his kids, up there. And then eventually a lot of them went up there, but this was always home because the roots run deep here and the community is so strong here. We just came off Lumbee homecoming where there are ten to fifteen thousand Lumbees that come back home and spend a week here of activities and festivities and gatherings. And a lot of people tie their family reunions to it.   So yeah, my first year back home. I taught for a living. I do keynotes and workshops, and I didn&#8217;t really know what I was going to do here and couldn&#8217;t find a job. It was very interesting. I came at one of the--. The housing market had just collapsed. And so for a year I just drove around and I could feel the blood ties here and the strength in the community and even the ties to the land. It was really quite spiritual to me. And I threw a kayak in the river and went down the river, and that was again very powerful for me. I would weep because I could feel the spirits of my ancestors here. It&#8217;s home because family&#8217;s here, and it&#8217;s home because the roots go so deep. They&#8217;re tied to the land here from farming and literal bloodshed back in the day. Deep, deep ties to Robeson County.  MF:  (          )   KP:  Yeah.  MF:  So you said your dad wanted to move because of racial tensions. What time was that, the [19]60s?  KP:  Well, early [19]50s.  MF:  Between the Native American community or--?  KP:  Well, it was still in the day [that] it was white or not white. &#8220;White only&#8221; was the term. So there was a lot of racial tension. There still is. We have a New South, but it&#8217;s still&#8212;. It&#8217;s there but more subversive. And at the same time there are so many progressive whites and other races who are looking to make change here. But it&#8217;s the South. It&#8217;s the South. And dad had been away and been in other countries where he didn&#8217;t have to experience this kind of thing, and when he came back here, it simply wasn&#8217;t acceptable for him to be that way. And yes, that was right at the cusp of the racial tensions, without a doubt. The Natives had been slaves for a while, as had everyone who wasn&#8217;t white. So they had been freed at that point in time but not allowed--. At that time a Native American couldn&#8217;t own this house in Red Springs. And it might even still be on the books, I&#8217;m told. So there was a lot of that back in those days. The stories that my parents tell. And I recorded quite a few of his stories around that--that there was no medical care. He watched his brother die in a ditch because he couldn&#8217;t get treatment. So a lot of historical trauma, deep wounding, and that&#8217;s part of why I came back to help move us through that process and heal. And that&#8217;s tied to that saying, &#8220;Deep in a river and dying of thirst.&#8221; We have these four distinct races here who are all caught up in the same economic and violent situation, and we have to work together to move beyond it, but it&#8217;s challenging when you have all those old wounds from way back when. And so how to move through that? And it&#8217;s interesting for me being raised away from here because I can see many of the people who have been here so long almost acting out of their teenage relationships because we&#8217;re still not that far removed from it. We&#8217;re still not that far removed from it. That&#8217;s my dad&#8217;s generation, where they were not allowed to drink and eat in the same places as whites. That&#8217;s just one generation ago. It&#8217;s still here in the psyche of our people for sure. For sure.  MF:  So you were in Florida for fifteen years.   KP:  Yes.  MF:  And what were you doing there?  KP:  Loving my life, [laughing] living in Fort Lauderdale. I&#8217;m an odd bird. I got a degree in psychology, but because I had done my own healing from my own childhood traumas, [I] knew that you couldn&#8217;t, for me, heal the psyche without healing the spirit. It was very clinical. That was not what I was interested in. So I ended up using my understanding of the human dynamic in sales and in management and that sort of thing. I was living with my eventual husband, but we met and fell in love in Baltimore, moved to Pittsburgh, which is where he was from, and one winter there was so brutal that I said to him, &#8220;I love you but if I don&#8217;t get out of here my spirit will kill my body.&#8221; It was just too cold. He said, &#8220;Where do you want to go?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Florida.&#8221; He&#8217;d never been. And we packed up our bags and moved to Florida because I did sales management and he was an accountant. We knew we could find jobs. It was a good economy then. So we moved to Florida and I ended up selling real estate and loved it. Then we started flipping real estate and loved it. And he was an accountant.   And then I was watching TV one day. I've always had somebody on the other end of my couch talking to me. I was always that person. I guess the psychology degree came in handy. But I was flipping through television and saw a gal on TV and something about her mesmerized me and I stopped. Her name was Cheryl Richardson and underneath her name was life coach. I was like, &#8220;What in the world is that?&#8221; It was like the Creator whispered over my shoulder, &#8220;That&#8217;s what I brought you here to be.&#8221; So immediately [I] found out what that was and became a certified life coach. I'd been shifted away from real estate and started doing trainings, leadership development, community development and economic development, personal development. And that&#8217;s where this whole other part of me came in. My dad used to say to me, &#8220;You need to pick one thing and do that.&#8221; But I never felt that was my path. And now I understand why, because whenever I need to do something I have that skill set, ironically enough. I can reach back there and pull that arrow out of my quiver and [arrow shooting noise] I&#8217;m good to go.   MF:  Yeah. Can you explain to me a little bit about what a life coach does?  KP:  Sure. I describe it as: a life coach helps you get from where you are to where you want to be.   MF:  Okay.  KP:  And sometimes when people are on the other side, they&#8217;ll say I can&#8217;t believe I paid you all that money to help me get there because sometimes it&#8217;s really simple steps. Sometimes it&#8217;s very complex steps. But the truth is most of us aren&#8217;t self-actualized in the way that--. We don&#8217;t live into our dreams. Mostly fear. Most of our decisions are based in fear, and sometimes its resources. Sometimes it&#8217;s critical thinking skills. Sometimes it&#8217;s strategic planning. So it depends on where you might be stuck. Literally I call it like what--. If you play a sport the coach helps you do the things you don&#8217;t want to do to get the things you do want to have. That&#8217;s pretty much what life coaching is. It&#8217;s evolved over the last twenty years. For a while we did it mostly around life skills. If you were [thinking] anything about maybe leaving your marriage or getting married or starting a business or whatever those things were, to now into helping employees work better, executive teams work better inside corporations. I do some work with some corporate America here [and] with a lot of the local governments here. I do a lot of volunteer work with community development and youth development, in helping them understand that your life is determined by the quality of your mind. It&#8217;s not your education. It&#8217;s not your skill set. It&#8217;s not your past that determines your future. It&#8217;s the quality of your mind. So I work in that arena. It all came back full circle, which in the Native way is typical, that you start and it&#8217;s not linear. Everything is circular. Isn&#8217;t that interesting that I ended up back there? That&#8217;s basically what a life coach is.   MF:  Okay. Is that when you started your motivational speaking?  KP:  Um hmm.  MF:  Okay. You talked about a variety of things or&#8212;?  KP:  Yeah, and a lot of it came out of the private coaching sessions that I would have where I would see people stuck and you start to notice themes. So the first one I did was around the fullness of expression, which was really the gift of conflict because--. A lot of it was liberating for me too. I came to understand the things are rarely black and white. If you and I get in a conflict not one of us is right and not one of us is wrong. We&#8217;re both trying to express where we are and how to do that and hold sometimes paradoxical statements at the same time, both being true. There&#8217;s a truth in you and a truth in me. But if we have to insist on black and white or right or wrong, we&#8217;re going to stay stuck in the struggle rather than really learning emotional intelligence. Allowing you to speak and me to feel whatever I need to feel and let that be and then me to speak and you to feel that. For the first few years I did it, it was mostly talking, and in time I decided to be brave and have practice inside the space. Now my workshops are actually less me talking and more allowing people to experience or practice or apply what they need to inside the space. Most of us know what we need to do. This is my easy descriptor of it, since I gained like fifty pounds since I moved to Carolina from Florida&#8212;a whole different lifestyle. But I say I know how to lose those fifty pounds, but unless I&#8217;m applying it, it doesn&#8217;t really do any good. So most of us have been through enough of this, read or learned or leaned into what it is that we want to do, but we haven&#8217;t yet because we haven&#8217;t applied it. The work I do now is a lot of application right in the space. So instead of telling you about this fullness of expression conversation and how to have conflict resolution, I would put couples together who could then practice this dynamic inside the space and ask questions.  MF:  Okay. Can you tell me about a specific workshop or talk that sticks out in your memory?  KP:  Oh my goodness; there are so many. Some of my favorite work is this notion of collapsing the perceived divide between us. I love doing cross the line exercises. Are you familiar with cross the line?  MF:  Uh uh.  KP:  Cross the line exercises--I just did one with 200 kids at the North Carolina Native American Youth Organization a few weeks ago. And what was funny is I did it as part of a healing workshop last year. And they said, &#8220;Miss Kim can we play that game?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Game, what game are you talking about?&#8221; They said, &#8220;That cross the line game.&#8221; I said, &#8220;What do you mean, game? That&#8217;s an intense exercise,&#8221; and they were like, &#8220;But we loved it.&#8221; And so what it taught me is that people really want to know about each other, but we don&#8217;t know to have that conversation. We don&#8217;t know how to ask questions or we don&#8217;t know how to be if we ask a question that makes the other person uncomfortable and we&#8217;re uncomfortable. But that&#8217;s how intimacy develops. Cross the line, I've done it many times here. I did it in American Women Indian Proud Nations conference. I did it in Florida. I've done it everywhere. I do it inside organizations. But it&#8217;s a silent exercise where you line everyone up, and you start with simple questions and cross the line is literally this. There&#8217;s a perceived line in the room. We&#8217;re over here. And I&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Cross the line if you&#8217;re a male.&#8221; So the guys would walk over. They&#8217;ll look back. It&#8217;s done in silence. And they&#8217;ll come back. I&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Thank you.&#8221; They&#8217;ll come back to the side. But then the questions begin to go deeper. &#8220;Cross the line if you&#8217;ve ever witnessed domestic violence in your home or by someone you love.&#8221; So they&#8217;ll cross the line and stand and come back. &#8220;Cross the line if you&#8217;ve ever felt insecure that you were too ugly or too fat or not good enough.&#8221; Everybody crosses the line. It gets deep. People begin to drop this perception that we&#8217;re separate and come to understand that we&#8217;re so much more alike than we are different. And if we can collapse this perceived divide, how different our lives could be. So that&#8217;s a thread throughout my workshops that I really (              ).  I've done keynote speaking for the Domestic Violence Coalition, and I love working with women in particular. We do a lot of healing workshops with the Native American women and I call them the &#8220;I Am&#8221; workshops where we get them--. If you really listen to what they&#8217;re saying to themselves about, &#8220;I am worthless&#8221; or &#8220;I don&#8217;t have any value.&#8221; And they change that inner dialogue to &#8220;I am beautiful and I am powerful and I am amazing.&#8221; And I do it with mirrors. It&#8217;s fascinating how many women won&#8217;t look at themselves in the mirror and declare their own amazement, amazingness, beauty. The Marianne Williamson thing. Who are we to be beautiful and smart and talented? Well, who are we not to be? We are supposed to shine.  MF:  How did you get to that point of embracing that idea and being drawn to helping women?  KP: I think it&#8217;s--I have chills all over me now--I think that our life comes to serve us if we allow it. And because I had to do my own healing work and was willing to sit with people in that space and that again is the difference between knowledge and application. I love social work and I think it&#8217;s brilliant, but what concerns me is we have a lot of academics who&#8217;ve never done their own process work. You can only lead a person to heal as far as you&#8217;ve allowed yourselves to heal. And because my whole life is about churning up my own stuff, looking at my own stuff and applying it and seeing how it can serve the world, it really became about trying to take the things that I was trying to hide about myself my whole life and talk about them and give them to the world. It opened up this whole other work because all of our stories, while they might seem personal, are really universal. I mean everybody can apply the same lessons. And it really became that. It became being courageous enough to offer people that I knew were hurting the tools that had helped me out. Mirror work is something&#8212;I have a mirror hanging in my hall now. When my marriage fell apart, a friend of mine made me a mirror that says &#8220;Beautiful, angel, inspiring.&#8221; For a couple of years I would look in that every day and connect with my own self. And came to really understand my own value. Does that mean that I don&#8217;t have my own insecurities and still go through my stuff? Of course I do. But it&#8217;s having tools to use every day that has helped make the difference. I know that I--. Had I not had those things I can&#8217;t imagine who I would&#8217;ve been today or what my life would&#8217;ve been like. It&#8217;s gratitude to the universe and the Creator that became my way, and to offer them to anyone who is willing to use them. It is the impetus for my work.  MF:  Can you tell me about your current role as president of Chamber of Commerce and how you came to that?  KP:  I wish I knew. I was telling a cousin of mine yesterday. Saturday we were walking around Lumbee homecoming. I said, &#8220;If somebody had told me when I came here that this would be my life I would&#8217;ve laughed. I would&#8217;ve been like, &#8216;There&#8217;s just no way. That&#8217;s not at all who I am.&#8217;&#8221; But there&#8217;s something interesting that happens in our lives that we are who we originally are. And when we are authentic doors open that we didn&#8217;t even know were there. It&#8217;s almost like you don&#8217;t even have to knock on them. And so I was invited by a few presidents ago to come and deliver a prayer for the annual banquet, and I delivered the prayer and then I was invited to come and speak. At one of their meetings I came and spoke, and from that the university asked me if I would administer a three-year grant that became a four-year grant that they had around entrepreneurship. And I did. As a member of the university I was invited to the Chamber meetings and so I would go. The next thing I knew they said, &#8220;We would like for you to be our president.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never even served on your board. I don&#8217;t know how this operates.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;We know you can.&#8221; I have done it in other places before, served on the board, never been the president but served on the board when I was in Philadelphia for a while. So I decided to take it on. Why not. Let&#8217;s try it. It&#8217;s typically a one year tenure. I&#8217;m in my third year now. And so it&#8217;s been a lot of fun. We&#8217;ve grown the membership from about seventy-five to we&#8217;re hovering [at] about 120 now, which is nice considering Pembroke is fairly small. We&#8217;ve really improved the relationship between the town and the gown. We started an annual street festival. We drop the pine cone on New Years Eve now. We built an eight foot tall, six hundred pound [pine cone].  MF:  I just saw that in the newspaper.  KP:  It&#8217;s really cool. We love that. And I do workshops with them and we have a board retreat, which is new. And we participate in all events, the homecoming for Lumbees and for the university. And we love to ride on the floats and be--. One of the things that I love to do is sit at lots of different tables and leverage those relationships that we partner with Peace in the Park. We partner with the arts council. We should make it to our 501(c)6 this year, but it took us a while to get a lot of those old financial records together because you have to have that in order to apply for that. We should have that completed throughout the summer and be able to apply for that, which were really the two things I wanted to do during my tenure. Use the platform to raise the conversation of local economy, creative economy. Again tied to the whisper, &#8220;Standing knee deep in a river dying of thirst.&#8221; We have four races here, all of whom have rich history and culture and craft. We have rivers like exist nowhere else. We have the culture center. There&#8217;s so much and land. More than eighty percent of produce is imported in Robeson County, which is ludicrous. Our kids are fat. We&#8217;re all fat. We&#8217;re not planting stuff. We&#8217;re eating GMO food. The farmers that are planting are doing soybeans that are taken out of here. We can rethink our resources and make sustainable lives for ourselves. We just have to wake up and work together to do it. So those are the two things I wanted to do; raise those conversation of local and creative economy and cultural tourism, ecotourism, agro-tourism, all those buzz words that this county doesn&#8217;t always get access to because we don&#8217;t always get a seat a table. People really have a perception of us because the statistics say we&#8217;re most poor--top three maybe in the country, often number one, and most violent, which isn&#8217;t really true and is at the same time. There&#8217;s considerable domestic violence here still and because of the location, there is some drug violence from time to time. We&#8217;re midway between New York and Florida. So drugs and drug money has definitely infiltrated here, but it&#8217;s not everything. It&#8217;s not everything.  MF:  So has that conversation been raised do you think since you&#8212;  KP:  Creative economy.  MF:  Yeah.  KP:  Oh yes. Yes, people now understand what it is, and it&#8217;s very interesting. During homecoming I&#8217;m feeling it being dropped in my spirit to be the change I wish to see. I keep hoping that other people will take it on. I&#8217;m an entrepreneur. I start lots of little local businesses and that sort of thing. Yesterday I sat back on the patio and sketched out a strategic plan of how I would tie these conversations together because I've been waiting for someone else to take it on. Now they understand it. They know models of it. They can point to it. They have statistics around it. They are getting it now. They being the whole county and even for me beyond that, the region. I've done a lot of workshops at Unity Conference to inspire our Native Americans to do it and even the Native American Youth Organization that I just did workshops with. They always have me come in and do entrepreneur workshops, and I talked to them about this very thing hoping to raise another generation of folk who will take what it is that we already have. I think the Creator is so wise and that often the medicine we need grows right outside our door, which is one of our proverbs or sayings. But to me it means look closer to home, inside yourself, around you for what it is to help make your life better versus going so far away. When we start looking for what we have&#8212;what is it that you love to do? It&#8217;s amazing what these kids come up with for ideas of how they can make businesses. And it&#8217;s also interesting to see them come back year after year having talked to people about it who are fearful for them who believe that you have to go get a degree. And believe me, I&#8217;m not against academia, but I&#8217;m an entrepreneur. Does everybody have to come out with $200,000 worth of loans and not be able to get a job? Or could some people start business? I can name quite a few who did very well. We have to raise both. We have to raise both conversations.  MF:  Yeah, I remember during the Women AdvaNCe roundtable something you said about women needing to be less reluctant or fearful of entrepreneurship. Why do you think that is? Why do you think so few women are willing to go into that or that direction or even see that as an option?  KP:  I think it&#8217;s our general innate insecurity. I also raised the conversation there that women come sixty percent confident where men come over confident to any situation. So they&#8217;re going to jump into it and try it and be competitive where that&#8217;s not our nature. We&#8217;re really much more collaborative and insecure by nature. Honestly I think it&#8217;s hormonally and chemically our brains operate differently and we don&#8217;t have that &#8220;ooh&#8221; thing to push through. And yet at the same time we have all the skills we need to be entrepreneurial because we tie them in our thinking to the male way of being, which is nice but really hasn&#8217;t served the greater collective. How much do you have to pay a person to move a ball down a court, or really would we do that? No. But I think they have a ball thing [laughs]. Somehow it&#8217;s all tied. I don&#8217;t really know.   It&#8217;s interesting for me especially as a Native American woman. There was a time where we were very matrilineally driven, and the clan system was based in the women. And then when Christianity hit us, we took on the patriarchy and [it] hasn&#8217;t necessarily served us so well. [Laughs] &#8220;Rut roh,&#8221; maybe not the best decision. And so then as women are now becoming breadwinners again and that sort of thing it&#8217;s that how to balance the masculine, the feminine even inside relationship because you do have to have both. But they can go back and forth, and he can even be the feminine energy, which isn&#8217;t being gay or a woman, not that there is even anything wrong with any of those things. Don&#8217;t hear that. But energetically that&#8217;s the way attraction happens, that somebody has to be in each of those roles.   Women sometimes struggle to be their most powerful self, and my closing comment that day was women have to really practice leading with our vaginas that we do have and not the penises that we don&#8217;t. It throws us off balance when we try to lead the way that they do. We don&#8217;t know that we can actually have businesses based in who we are, in collaborati[on] and born of the things that we love and [that we don&#8217;t] actually have to suffer at work. So there is a paradigm shift that has to happen for us to be more wooed into it. And as we come to understand it and too the structure--. The infrastructure isn&#8217;t built for us to be able to have it all and be able to take care of our kids and our parents and start businesses, or we don&#8217;t think it is. But as we begin to ask for those things or insist [on] those things and vote for people who will make sure we get those things that that can all shift. I keep reminding myself and others, we&#8217;re just one generation away from really severe racism and just a couple of generations away from the women&#8217;s movement where we go the right to vote. While it seems like we want it to be a lot, change happens slowly. It really happens slowly. So we all have to make our deposits in there and trust that they will keep going.   MF:  What was the dynamic like in your family in terms of your mom or dad? Was there a balance between your patriarchy and the matriarchy?  KP:  Good question. My mother certainly was able to speak her mind. Very opinionated, strong woman as she, she passed away from cancer in 1997. One of the things she said to me as she was dying was, &#8220;Remember you came from a long line of strong Lumbee women.&#8221; She would say that to me over and over and over again. At the same time it was a good dynamic. It worked for them and it worked for us as children to give us a sense of security that Dad always had the final say. He did the money piece, balanced the checkbook. Well, he didn&#8217;t really balance the checkbook, but he handled the money and I say that because neither one of my parents were very educated. My mother didn&#8217;t get her high school diploma until after--I don&#8217;t know, it might have even been here. It might have been after she retired and they moved here. It was way beyond, and my father never did. So by the time I was in third grade I was educated beyond them, and I would write the checks and my dad would sign them and I would do all that in the house. But as far as their family dynamic, as far as their leadership of our house [went], they were pretty unified in it. And Dad would support what Mom would say. As the only girl, sometimes I could get a few things out of Dad if Mom had said no. The boys the same but mostly pretty consistent. And one of my favorite Mom and Dad stories was Dad--. Lumbee men are very, &#8220;I&#8217;m the guy in charge.&#8221; But my mother had moved to the city, and she was taking on some of the northern ways of being. My dad would always come to the dinner table with his shirt off. My mom would be like, &#8220;Please put a shirt on when you come to the dinner table.&#8221; He was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to wear a shirt.&#8221; So she came to the dinner table with her shirt off. [Laughs] Boobs hanging out. And so my dad&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay I get it.&#8221; She had that way of being with him that was really quite lovely, and they shared the leadership role pretty much. But if push came to shove, it was Dad&#8217;s way. It wasn&#8217;t necessarily bullying. He would explain it, these are my reasons why.   MF:  Okay.  KP:  It worked well.  MF:  Did that influence you later on in terms of your relationship with your husband?  KP:  Perhaps. The interesting thing about my husband and I is we lived together for ten years before we ever married. And marriage never interested me, nor children. I said that very early on. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see myself ever married and I don&#8217;t see myself having children.&#8221; Of course my mother would say, &#8220;When you meet the right man, you&#8217;ll change your mind.&#8221; Well, I met the right man. He was wonderful and we lived together for ten years, and then we married and only stayed married for about five. And in the Christian point of view they don&#8217;t really understand this. But I&#8217;m much more spiritual than Christian, and we had gone as far as we could because I knew my path was to come back here, and it was not his. And his is to stay where he is and we&#8217;re still great friends. We keep in touch. Whenever I go to Florida, we have dinner. I&#8217;m in touch with his family, and the divorce was amicable. We opened up a bottle of wine, walked around the house. I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take this, you take that.&#8221; In my Christian family&#8217;s point of view that doesn&#8217;t--they still struggle with that because it was an amazing relationship, very much built on mutual respect and friendship. One of the stories I tell about it--and then sometimes I say maybe that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re not still married. But when we first got together and lived together he came to me. He said, &#8220;I just want you to know I want to be a good partner for you and I really want to help you around the house and you let me know what you need to do and I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;The first thing you need to understand is this is not my house and this is not my responsibility. So you&#8217;re not helping me. You don&#8217;t get any extra credit [Laughter] because I work too.&#8221; So and we both laughed about that, but that was always our way. Whoever got home first started the meal and whoever cooked the meal didn&#8217;t have to do the dishes and so we negotiated things. Probably because I saw my mother&#8217;s ability to have a voice in the house I knew that that was possible. But like I said, I always had that rebellious part in me. &#8220;Here&#8217;s the rules and let me see if I can go here, just get a little bit on the other side of the rules.&#8221; So both/and, I think.   MF:  Okay. You&#8217;re also president of the board of the Southeastern Family Violence Center. Can you tell me a little bit about that?  KP:  Again you never know where these things are coming from. My cousin James Locklear is the editor of the Native Visions magazine, and he called me one Sunday and he said, &#8220;I want to take you around and show you some of the graves where your people are.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Great, cool.&#8221; So we&#8217;re out and about and we&#8217;re talking about things that stir me. And I was talking about this issue of domestic violence among our people and how I believe it&#8217;s tied to historical trauma and too this thing that for a long time because of the social injustice our women wouldn&#8217;t turn the men in because if they did, then they were turned over to a culture that was just brutal. And so as Natives we understand that the collective has to be healed. Him and her, not ostracizing him and sending him in a way in a system that then when he comes back he&#8217;s even worse, and alienating him from the kids and all that. So my cousin James said, &#8220;Well, I serve on the board of the Family Violence Center. And I think you&#8217;d be a great addition.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; So I went and served on the board, and I don&#8217;t think he ever came to a meeting after that. I think his job was to deliver me or something. So I serve on the board, and it&#8217;s only been maybe three months now that our board president resigned. And because I headed the personnel committee and served on the finance committee, but when she resigned that night, &#8220;Will you take the role?&#8221; because there had been some interest in me doing it for a while. But I wasn&#8217;t really sure. I didn&#8217;t want to dethrone anyone but so we had all been in stillness or prayer or whatever you want to call it about it. And again the door opened and there you had it. Yeah, it&#8217;s a miracle.  MF:  How do you balance it all?  KP:  Yeah. Balance, that&#8217;s an interesting word. That&#8217;s a very interesting word. When I came, it was really a deal with the Creator that whatever door he opened I would walk through and like I said, for a year I had no income, and it took me deeper in a way of trusting life. I mean I use the word &#8220;Creator,&#8221; but really I think life itself is working in our favor if we could really learn to trust in that. And I believe in the design of it all. I believe that there&#8217;s someone for everything if we don&#8217;t live into our fear that things really do work out. My favorite saying is--but not my favorite. I have so many favorites but another one is, &#8220;Everything works out in the end; if it hasn&#8217;t worked out, it&#8217;s not the end.&#8221; So then when I finally did, then the tribe came to me and said, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re starting a vocational rehab program. Would you help us get it set up? And we don&#8217;t have a lot of money,&#8221; but they know how to do the vocational rehab part. No one&#8217;s ever--. You have to negotiate leases and set up systems. So I did that for a while.   That leveraged the job at the university. I have yet to apply for a job. I have yet to ask for anything. It&#8217;s all come. Yeah. And so then working with the university made lots of great relationships and because of that would have to go out and speak to people, and people would say, &#8220;Do you speak on other topics?&#8221; And so then this and then at the same time I was doing healing circles here at my house and women&#8217;s circles, and so it all has  tied together, and life here doesn&#8217;t cost a whole lot so I don&#8217;t need a whole lot of money. And I charge a pretty good day rate. So if I work three or four days a month, then all my bills are paid, and I can put some money away and then give the rest of the time to the community. At the same time I do have to watch and monitor myself because there&#8217;s so much work to be done here that it can be consuming. And there are times when I&#8217;ll catch myself, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m really pretty far down at the bottom of this list. Let me do something about that.&#8221; So I have to practice what I preach, use my own tools and make space in my calendar to remarket myself. But a lot of it--. I don&#8217;t really have to have a website. I don&#8217;t even have business cards other than the chamber stuff, but for my stuff it's all word of mouth. Yeah. Somebody will meet me and say whatever they say about me, but, &#8220;Can you come?&#8221; I&#8217;m still when you reached out--. I was saying well, what&#8217;s that all about. I never know, but I listen and intuitively if it feels right then I go, and if it doesn&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t. And that way I can release the outcome and not worry about [it]. I use my mind in service to my spirit, not the other way around. And I think instinct and intuition are something that we have put away, and it&#8217;s not a psychic thing. It&#8217;s an innate thing in all of us. I hear people talk about it very cavalierly like, &#8220;Oh my gut told me this,&#8221; or &#8220;I had a feeling.&#8221; So it&#8217;s there. We just have to listen. As we do I think we would all be slotted into exactly the right place that we&#8217;re supposed to be in instead of trying to fit into somebody else&#8217;s slot.  MF:  So actually I saw your name come up for when I was on the Apples website because I&#8217;m, I have (              ) winter.   KP:  I&#8217;m in the strangest of places, am I not?  MF:  So did the one of the break teams come here or did you talk to them?  KP:  Yeah. I've had three teams now. The first team happened as a fluke because the person who usually gets them, Mac Legerton from Center for Community Action, was going to be out of town, and it was a family emergency. So he called me and said, &#8220;Hey, I have fifteen kids coming from Chapel Hill. Can you meet with them tomorrow and tell them about the community and that sort of stuff?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, sure.&#8221; So I met with the first group. Like I said I&#8217;m in a circle and I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t really know why I&#8217;m here. But I&#8217;m going to tell you about the work that I do and about the community.&#8221; And so we stayed connected and several of them are my Facebook friends and we keep in touch. So the second group came through, and I had learned so much about being real with that first group because really that&#8217;s my thing. If we could all understand to not be fearful of one another this world would change. And I honestly think that the person sitting next to me at the coffee shop probably has some insight into what I&#8217;m dealing with or maybe even connecting me with something that I need to be connected with or me for him. But because we&#8217;re not talking, we don&#8217;t know.   So that first group we had such--. None of us wanted to leave. We were so enjoying that conversation. I didn&#8217;t know that they didn&#8217;t know each other. I&#8217;m thinking everybody&#8217;s great friends. But we were by the time that ended. So then the second group came, and I had talked with them based on the first conversation and decided to be intentionally deep with them. And they loved it and ate it up, and so then this last group came and ironically enough it was two groups, one from Georgia and the Apples group. We had thirty-five kids in a space and we&#8217;re sitting on the floor and having this deep level of conversation. And the Apples group--and this was new this last time which I will now insist on--every time said, &#8220;Can you come back and meet with us at the end because now that we&#8217;ve been in your community we have some questions and we know you&#8217;ll talk to us from a deep place?&#8221; So I came back and we had this lovely closing conversation again that really solidified some of those friendships and from that they invited me up to Chapel Hill to speak up there. So that&#8217;s the Apples connection. Again don&#8217;t even know how it happened, didn&#8217;t look for it, there it is.   MF:  Do you think it&#8217;s helpful to have people from outside of the community come in and observe it and try to understand it or do they stay connected?  KP:  Yeah, it&#8217;s helpful for both. It&#8217;s helpful for us because it brings people in and there is again the historical trauma thing here, that apathy sets in. You get a sense that people don&#8217;t know or care about us here. And the Lumbee people themselves, ourselves are still trying to figure out ways to be with the greater world because we&#8217;ve been so isolated, so insular here. So I think that for my community it&#8217;s really good, not to mention the service that they provide. They do things while they&#8217;re here. And also I believe one or two will be wooed enough to want to come here and make an impact. And for you guys coming here I think having access to an Indian community that&#8217;s not your stereotypically western Indian community is eye opening, and any time again we can collapse this perceived divide between us, especially this ludicrous thing called racism. I heard a DuBose quote the other day saying something like, &#8220;What if racism is a unicorn?&#8221; I was like, wow. And then he went on to say, &#8220;But if we&#8217;re not careful the horns of the unicorn will bloody us.&#8221; And again that&#8217;s tied to my belief that this is a perceived divide. We spend a lot of time imagining the great divide and then spend our precious energy trying to cross it, where if we could just know that there&#8217;s no divide, it would be different. Yeah, it would be so different. So I think that there&#8217;s great value in it on both sides. I really do.   MF:  Okay. Can you tell me about your Women AdvaNCe team and how that started and what you&#8217;re hoping to accomplish with that?  KP:  Yes. The Women&#8217;s AdvaNCe team was a byproduct of going to Women AdvaNCe last year. Don&#8217;t even know how that happened either. Somehow it was dropped on my Facebook and I&#8217;m clicking through it, and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; And so I then said [on Facebook], &#8220;Anybody here interested in going?&#8221; These two gals I'd never met before that are now my great friends said, &#8220;Yeah. Let&#8217;s go.&#8221; So we jumped in a van together, in her little Mazda thing, went up there, and it was interesting because a lot of the statistics they were talking about are our county. Because they&#8217;re talking about the most poor and the violent&#8212;our greatest ends of the spectrum. They&#8217;re talking about us. So we stood up and spoke. Were you there?  MF:  No, I wasn&#8217;t there last year. No.  KP:  Okay. So we stood up and spoke and that started this whole relationship with us and the Women AdvaNCe group and that&#8217;s how I met Mary and Kim Marie and Laura and all them. Because we stood up and spoke and said, &#8220;We need help down there.&#8221; Deborah&#8217;s husband is a retired military--. All three are Lumbee. Deborah&#8217;s husband is a retired colonel from military. So if you ever watch Army Wives she was like Claudia Joy,  only in Lumbee form. And then Enid was in charge of the jail and lived away in California and I lived away. So we know what&#8217;s possible. And we know that if we can shake people out of their apathy, move them beyond their fear, connect them to resources, create actionable steps, we can make change.   So we were like, &#8220;Are you guys going to take this on the road? Will you come down and share this information with us?&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;re just starting. We&#8217;re not really sure that we can do that.&#8221; But then when they said they wanted people to start local chapters, we were like, &#8220;Great.&#8221; So we came back knowing we were going to start one and shortly after that [Meda Gao?] who wanted to run for county commissioner, and she&#8217;s the first women to ever run for county commissioner--not the first one to be one. There was one who serve[d] out the end of a term for somebody else.   We know Women AdvaNCe is not partisan, but as part of our own work we wanted to work with her. So we tied a women&#8217;s event sponsored by her because she&#8217;s a local businesswoman [with] no partisan experience at all, but just to talk about it. We had a panel talking about different women&#8217;s issues. And we did that in December so we&#8217;ve met monthly after that. July 23rd we&#8217;re doing a big roll out event tied with the North Carolina Women&#8217;s Council or Council for Women, their report The Status of Women in Robeson County. And again what&#8217;s so fascinating--it always gets interesting because to me those two organizations need to work closely together. But politically it&#8217;s hard for them to. So I developed a friendship with this gal from the Council of Women who wanted to roll it out here. I said, &#8220;Great, but we&#8217;re tied to our Women AdvaNCe work.&#8221; And she said, &#8220;I really like that.&#8221; She said, &#8220;I&#8217;m really glad this is going to a deposit of stuff.&#8221; So we&#8217;ll see when everybody picks it up. But she said, &#8220;I&#8217;m getting a little push back because some of the women in Women AdvaNCe have said some things against our governor who is the one who funds my organization.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Therein lies our challenge: we as women keep doing this women&#8217;s work in nonprofit ways. We have to figure out how to set up for profits that we can then fund on our own and have our own rules and regulations around how this is going to be done.&#8221; And she has two years left before her retirement, and so she&#8217;s fearful of losing her job. And yet her job is to be involved in the interest of women. So I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Wow, still a man&#8217;s world.&#8221; So that&#8217;s really deep and intense.   So for us the reason we started this is women outvote men six to one in Robeson County and yet we continue to elect leaders who do not have our best interests at heart. To bring that conversation in a different way and to help women understand how powerful they are and give them steps, whether they be five-minute things that they can do or really become an activist to effect change here and be supportive of each other in that way. And for me tied to that too is bringing real gifts of conflict resolution because old stuff does come up. When you get enough women around a table over a period of time, like we had in that space that day, we talked about [how] there is an inner mean girl in us. We haven&#8217;t figured out how to deal with that. And if somebody is cuter than us, our little girls are going to act up. For us it&#8217;s to be really conscious in that way of moving women&#8217;s issues through regardless of race, socioeconomics and even gender because we do have some men who want to come that day who are on our side who get it. There are some progressive men who are like, &#8220;Can we come?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Can you sponsor the luncheon? Because we&#8217;re trying&#8221;&#8212;not trying. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to find sponsors for that luncheon. I need four and I have two, but I just started looking for them.&#8221; So they&#8217;ll come out. But that&#8217;s really what we want to do is create a real network among women where we help each other find the jobs and the resources and encourage each other to start businesses. There&#8217;s an opportunity for microenterprise lending here. There&#8217;s so many women who do crafting but don&#8217;t have the $200 that they need maybe to set up at a festival or to create the display board. And so some of these women who have big businesses can create an opportunity for women to do that but don&#8217;t really know that they need it or how. So to be better together and to be collaborative and not competitive. Again, to operate with our vaginas and not with our penises, just saying.  MF:  Have you seen within the Women AdvaNCe team and this women&#8217;s network that it has been crossing socioeconomic and racial boundaries so it&#8217;s&#8212;?  KP:  Yes.   MF:  It is?  KP:  Yeah, it was so much fun. We had a planning meeting at the family violence center because Linda Murphy from the Council of Governments knew where it was. When we had the planning session last week, I looked around the table and it made my heart swell because there was a Hispanic lady there, Gail Fernandez; there were two African American women there; there were two Caucasian women there and there were four Native American because we only had room for twelve people around the table. And we were actually bursting at the seams because so many people showed up to be part of that conversation, just to help plan it. And they were from every end of people needing the services to businesswomen and the woman who had run for county commissioner. I found that very self-satisfying in that moment. I was like, wow. I keep tearing up and having to stop myself, but I know for myself had I not really done the work to know who I was and how I could effect change and still have to reckon with myself in that way, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to have an impact. I know there are people who are even smarter and more powerful than me [and] if we can remind them of that, what we can do around here is going to be incredible. It&#8217;s absolutely going to be incredible and help the babies and the elders, and there are way too many people suffering here in Robeson County with the resources that we have. So yes, people are getting stirred up and want to make a change and not by way of being militant. When we have to be, yes, but there are other things that we can do in the meanwhile. We had a gal there from the arts council, which was really exciting because that&#8217;s part of it too. We have to tie all these things together.   MF:  That&#8217;s great.  KP:  Most of those meetings I end up chairing or facilitating. And I love to create vision stories, like what would it be like if we had this, a world that did this and a world that did that? And do we have the resources? And I&#8217;ll ask them, &#8220;Do we?&#8221; And they&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;Yeah, we have the Arts Council, and yeah, we have the university and yeah, we have craft people and yeah, we have rivers and yeah, we have land. So what&#8217;s stopping us?&#8221; And they&#8217;re fully aware that it&#8217;s us. It&#8217;s us. It&#8217;s not that we don&#8217;t have resources. We&#8217;re just not resourceful. Big difference, big difference.  MF:  So you went to the White House Summit.  KP:  Wow! [Laughter]  MF:  Were you the only one from&#8212;  KP:  No, the other two gals went with me.   MF:  Cool. What was that like?  KP:  There were twenty of us from&#8212;  MF:  From Women AdvaNCe.  KP:  Yeah, from North Carolina from Women AdvaNCe, yeah. It was amazing. It was so empowering. I don&#8217;t know if you had a chance to read the article.  MF:  I did.  KP:  Which one?  MF:  I read the one the Robeson&#8212;  KP:  The Robesonian, okay.   MF:  Yeah, Robesonian, yeah.  KP:  I didn&#8217;t know how that was going to turn out because I was literally still processing it when she got me. It was a phone interview with a guy I'd never met before, and you don&#8217;t know what your stuff is going to turn out to be. But I thought she did a pretty good job. What was so powerful for me was one, being in a space with so many progressive thinkers that--. I&#8217;m probably the visionary here but to be with people who are like, &#8220;Oh I hadn&#8217;t even thought about that&#8221; was stimulating and soul stirring to me in a big old support group in many ways. But then to try to break it down and figure out ways that those things could serve here too, and  reminding myself of the value of empowering women to step into their roles as I watched all those women in leadership there became extremely important to me here. And what will happen as we value family and taking care of elders and taking care of kids and family medical leave and including that for men too? Being able to fold all of that in to support family and so many things--. That change happens slowly and incrementally was really a great reminder for me because I want it all.   When I took the chamber for one year, I thought, &#8220;Oh, I can get all this done in a year.&#8221; Well, it&#8217;s two and a half years, and I&#8217;m still working on [it]. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, great reminder for me.&#8221; And hearing other people&#8217;s struggles too--it&#8217;s not a success only thing, and you have to really prepare yourself for that. It was amazing. Joe Biden&#8217;s story, I didn&#8217;t know any of that. I lived in Delaware for a while. I don&#8217;t know how that wasn&#8217;t part of my consciousness, but honestly I was a capitalist before I came back here and did this work. So this is fascinating to me, doing this work. And yet, here I am. And staying in the room with the two of those gals that I didn&#8217;t--. We built a friendship, and then something happens when you travel that far in a car, and it was fascinating because this is a very conservative climate and even though those two women are progressive, they&#8217;re probably not as liberal as I am. And so some of the things that&#8212;don&#8217;t worry about the water. That&#8217;s why I love this table. So some of the things that were being discussed there we had debate about in the ride back. And even had to learn to practice--. We decided to use ourselves in that conversation as a model of how to practice the conflict and the challenge we know is going to happen inside of our organization because there are some old stuck ways of thinking here in Robeson County. And so how to be respectful of those and how to agree to disagree and how to genuinely listen to another person&#8217;s point of view. So that&#8217;s all really good. We did a practice where Enid in particular and I were debating a point hot and heavy, and I was like, &#8220;Okay, first of all I can feel my body chemistry changing as I&#8217;m sure [you] can too. So let&#8217;s wait a minute and let the chemicals abate, and then let&#8217;s come at this from a challenge where maybe you&#8217;ll argue my point of view and I&#8217;ll argue yours. And let&#8217;s see if we&#8217;re really hearing each other.&#8221; That was so cool.  MF:  Did it work?  KP:  Yes!   MF:  It did.  KP:  Yes, so we really did, although we still both held our own points of view at the end. We had a different understanding and value for the other&#8217;s point of view. And I actually did realize they both could sit alongside of each other because they have to. I mean they have to. We&#8217;re not going to shift everyone everywhere, but if we can get to the parts where we agree and operate from there instead of going our separate ways because of the parts we disagree, that&#8217;s how we&#8217;re going to be able to keep our group together.   MF:  Yeah.  KP:  It was a beautiful exercise. Beautiful.  MF:  Do you find that you&#8217;re more liberal and progressive&#8212;  KP:  Hello.  MF:  Does that bring up a lot of conflicts, living here and the work that you do?  KP:  Yes, and at the same time it&#8217;s driven me to a deeper part of myself because one of my personal beliefs is that no matter the question, love is the answer. And that love is the most transformative power of all and that exists in every good work, every theory, every philosophy, every religion. So if we can meet there we can be okay. So it&#8217;s a practice for me. When I want to be militant and push my point of view through to find a way, to find the way to love, and then that love for the other person and their point of view can help us both transform in ways that even if we agree to disagree it&#8217;s a loving agreeing to disagree.   I lived in Fort Lauderdale at Wilton Manors and helped transform that economic landscape by helping many gay men buy houses in a place that they couldn&#8217;t have afforded them or there wasn&#8217;t funding for. And so there became a whole gay community there of men and here that&#8217;s a real problem because of their Bible belief. So it&#8217;s been extremely interesting for me, and this is where I get to see if I have courage that I&#8217;m always encouraging others to have is that coming back--. I was raised in the church. The scriptures that were taught to me as a child are being delivered to me now with a very different interpretation.   And I write every day. My deal with myself is a thousand words minimum every day, and so I probably have four or five books queued up some day I might put out there. I don&#8217;t really know. But they&#8217;re very bizarre. And one of them is the Bible as self-help because I keep getting these odd&#8212;I&#8217;ll be experiencing something, and then a scripture will come and it&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;That&#8217;s what I meant by that. That&#8217;s what I meant by that. That&#8217;s what I meant by that.&#8221; So I have been jotting them down and elaborating on them.   It&#8217;s interesting. It&#8217;s very interesting because I still go back to Florida and do workshops. And those are very progressive different workshops than here, and at the same time the more healing work that we do here, which was challenging too because when I produce the word healing, for many people here healing only comes from God. But yet we go to doctors and get pills. So it was how to find the language and the energetic way of being that would woo them to a space where they could hold something different for a moment. Cognitive dissonance when you have to break from what you believed for a long time is painful, and I went through it myself. I have crazy stories. I was molested in the back of a church as a child by a person who then came out and spoke in tongues, and there was a message delivered. So you can imagine the stories that I told to myself, and this happened for a long time as a child when I would come here for summers. And yet something deep always wooed me to be healed.   Whether it was walking by the rivers or just quiet. I say I am as comfortable in a Holy Ghost-filled church service as I am a camp meeting, as I am an ashram as I am with my Jewish friends at synagogue, as I am on my patio because it&#8217;s not about the process or the path to that place. It&#8217;s about the place itself. And so that&#8217;s what I find is so interesting about me then coming back here and helping build these bridges between in these different places. Because as I was going through my own healing process I can remember what it was like for me to break away from what I had been taught traditionally and how it was so deeply disturbing that many times I called out, &#8220;Please help me to understand.&#8221; Because some of the things I now believe I was taught back then were evil. And yet there was something deep inside me that was stirring me, and it didn&#8217;t feel bad; it felt good, and so I would cry out and again the chills of, &#8220;Help me understand.&#8221; The words of &#8220;I am the same God&#8221; keep coming to me all the time. They get dropped in my spirit. &#8220;I am the same God. I am the same God.&#8221; So I live and operate from that place and offer that to those who are open to hear it because there are some we know will never be swayed. There are some who are looking for help out of that thing because they&#8217;re having questions too. And there are some that are like, &#8220;Oh yeah, I&#8217;m there.&#8221;   So I work in the &#8220;Oh yeah, I&#8217;m there and I can be swayed,&#8221; and the rest--that might be the next generation&#8217;s work or they may never be or they might be the thing against we have to push so we get our chrysalis muscle. I don&#8217;t know, but I try to stay in that space and have enough courage to speak my piece, but most truth and most love is really important to me versus taking a bat and trying to shatter people&#8217;s belief systems. Because I felt my own cognitive dissonance, and I was being wooed out of it because of my own pain. Imagine if that&#8217;s not true for somebody else, and I&#8217;m trying to get them to try to see something different. And the issues are like spanking children. I mean it&#8217;s still very prevalent in my community and in Robeson County. I&#8217;m surprised, it&#8217;s probably even allowed in schools here. And the whole issue of homosexuality and just letting people be. Those are really big things here as well. And abortions and taking control of our own body. It&#8217;s really mostly anything that&#8217;s tied to scripture that they interpret differently. And yet at the same time there are other scriptures like not gossiping and taking care of our bodies. There&#8217;s a lot of really fat people here. Me, I can&#8217;t believe how much weight I gained since I've been here. But I just got my NutriBullet. [Laughs] You wait.   MF:  My roommate just got one of those too.  KP: It&#8217;s coming off. I&#8217;m taking it off. I decided to let myself eat all the collard sandwiches I wanted during homecoming. And now I&#8217;m going to get serious about it. It&#8217;s time. And too I want to again use my life as a model for other people. So I&#8217;m like if I&#8217;m going to be practicing this whole thing of, &#8220;Look, let&#8217;s be different with ourselves and each other and be holistic,&#8221; and so I&#8217;ve put a little container garden in my patio back there, and I want to lead the way of healthier eating, and again I&#8217;m really about practicing what I preach. That&#8217;s in the mind, body, spirit conversation, the body since I've been here is the one thing I've been neglecting. So I&#8217;m going to give it a little more attention.   MF:  Yeah. Do you think that you were able to heal and then come back and have more success working with community because you were able to step out for a while?  KP:  Yes. Yes.  I would&#8217;ve said [this] before I came back. [I think it helped me] very clearly understand what people here dealt with because I had been through it myself, but when I came back and still even now sometimes I&#8217;m aware it&#8217;s even deeper than what my experience was because I did get to go away. I didn&#8217;t have to see him all the time. For people here, especially the women many times go to church with or have family reunions with people that have hurt them the most and not only around issues of sexual violence but domestic violence or even [that] your father stole the land of my father. I say that we swim and poop and eat all in the same water. Then we have to run into each other at Food Lion and Wal-Mart.   Even now I feel I know I&#8217;m reckoning with things and that reckoning I use to have compassion and empathy for what others must be going through and at the same time know we can&#8217;t stay stuck there. That is the path. That is the journey. That is the role, to continue to move beyond that in ways not just numbly, blindly saying it&#8217;s okay. But finding deep forgiveness. And forgiveness does not have to mean restoration. We don&#8217;t have to allow that to occur again but [we have] to move beyond the stuck places. Yes, without a doubt, the modalities that I use in practice, I would never have learned had I stayed here. And it&#8217;s hard, I still am very selective who I share those with. But I&#8217;m feeling a deeper willing to talk about them in much larger ways. It&#8217;s interesting that many of them are also tied to my culture, but yet Christianity still pushes some of those away. When I came back and told Dad I wanted to start doing sweat lodges he said [grumbling noise]. &#8220;Dad, I can do both. I can do both. I can go to church with you on Sundays and still do the sweat lodges.&#8221; Since we&#8217;ve done them it&#8217;s been interesting who comes and women who are nervous to come but yet feel a wooing. That&#8217;s what I say. If you feel like it&#8217;s for you, then come. And you might not go in the sweat lodge. You might just tend the fire or be part of food at first. Let your spirit guide you, let your intuition or your instinct that exists in all of us be the one that pulls you towards whatever it is that will save you.   MF:  For all the people that can&#8217;t step out, the people that have been here for years, what do you think is going to be able to push them to change? What do you think that their solution is if they have been stuck in their ways?  KP:  I think it&#8217;s those of us who have been able to get away and learn and heal to come back and be vulnerable and share those stories and provide a bridge and safe places for them, and that&#8217;s why I do the healing circles. I have women&#8217;s circles here at my house. I go into communities and do them. I&#8217;ll go in churches and do them. A lot of forgiveness, family forgiveness work, community forgiveness work. For me my next progression will be, because I&#8217;m trained in nonviolent communication--. I've done work with Jews and Germans in Florida. So I've done the work, but it is very interesting to be here where I could be in a circle with someone and see them at Wal-Mart or Food Lion after I&#8217;ve just seen them and held all of their stuff. So it&#8217;s different. And at the same time  from having been here for eight years and people sniffing me and smelling me and knowing that I am exactly the same person that I said I was no matter where I am and that I am open about my own stuff too. I&#8217;m not setting myself up to be some savior of the world. No, these are tools that I use, and I still have to use them most days. And being completely as vulnerable as I can which was hard because it did lend itself to, if somebody had decided they were going to hurt me, I&#8217;m giving them the ammunition to do so. But what I've found is when I did that, they chose not to, and if they did, then it was something else that I could heal because the wounding had already happened, and I wanted it to serve. And once you really get that, that the very things you thought were here to destroy you--which is actually scriptural--can be used for good, then it can empower.  MF:  Okay. So anything that I've left out that you would like to talk about?  KP:  I think you've about pulled it off. [Laughing] Not really. For me as a woman, I&#8217;m intrigued by my own particular journey and can&#8217;t wait to see what the end story will be. If you do this kind of work, does it mean you have to do it alone or is there a male partner who can be with you in this dance? Because again my ex-husband was my very best friend, and we still have the best conversations. But it was interesting, I had the folk life people here this last week, and one of them was a guy who we would come home from the activities of the day and have these great conversations. Now he was way too young for me or anything like that. But I said to him, &#8220;It&#8217;s been so beautiful for you to hold the space for me in that way,&#8221; because I've been home now for eight years and divorced for ten and I had felt, &#8220;Well, this work must be solitary and so I&#8217;m going to be--.&#8221; It&#8217;s part of the chapter yet unwritten that we&#8217;ll have to see if there&#8217;s a space to give as much time and energy to the work and then still have relationship with someone. But if that doesn&#8217;t come, my soul&#8217;s fed a lot. I still miss that in some ways and at the same time could probably be okay if it never came, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s true of everyone. I think that other people get to have different things but also know that they don&#8217;t have the flexibility. There&#8217;s never anybody I ever have to answer to. And that&#8217;s nice if I want to go to--.   That&#8217;s the interesting thing for me right now, and for me the next steps are--. Definitely I preach all the time, &#8220;Be the change you want to see in the world.&#8221; And I've been pushing others towards this conversation of cultural tourism. But I have a sense that I&#8217;m being led to be the one to get everyone to the table because I sit at all those tables. And that&#8217;s my thing is leveraging resources, and even one of the gals last week said, &#8220;This is so interesting to see the people at this table that are also at this table and this table,&#8221; because we now understand that we have to leverage those resources. So if I work with you in domestic violence and [I&#8217;m] doing the food movement conversation over here, you probably need to be over here too because those women can feed themselves and their children from local food options and understand that their kids aren&#8217;t getting as good grades because they&#8217;re being fed sugar and their brains are being fried--that it&#8217;s all tied together. It&#8217;s a holistic way of being, not self-silos. Did you run out of tape? [Laughs] Not so bad.  MF:  Yeah, that&#8217;s all I have.  KP:  Cool. Cool. I want to talk about you.
