No electricity.  Running water?  No running water. Had a well out there. You know you   d draw it up  with a big long bucket.  And an outhouse?  Yep, yep.

Then my mother  had a big garden, and we had all kinds of fruit and stuff. She canned and  everything, killed hogs and cows and stuff, you know. The only thing we  ever bought would be sugar, coffee, and pepper and that   s about it.  And where would you go to get those things?  Store.  But in Pryor or     Well, yeah. Mostly every Saturday we   d go in the wagon from there and  down to Pryor. It   s about twelve or fourteen miles.  And that would take you all day to do?  Yep.  Hmm     And we   d all have lunch while we was there. Then in the summertime  on Saturdays we   d take ice back and have about four gallons of ice  cream. (Laughs)  That sounds good.  It was.  Was it the crank?  Yep.  Had the crank.  Yep. Crank and somebody would set down on it. Yep.  What flavor?  Vanilla.  Well, what were some of your chores?

I helped bale hay, ride  a horse around the thing, you know. Them times, they had one guy on  each side of it putting the strings in. It was wire then but it   s string now,  and he   d push it through and the other guy, the guy up there you know  chomping the stuff in and the thing going around with a plunger. I   d ride  a horse sometimes on the plunger, and sometimes the go-devil  sweep-rack   would get clogged and I   d get down and bring the grass back up.  And I picked cotton and I done anything.  Hmm     Yep. Rode a horse to get the cows back in, you know. Yep.  How early in the morning would you have to get up?  Oh    Early. Yep, when you had to milk and stuff and feed.  And do that before you went to school?  Yep. Yep.  Where did you go to elementary school?  Right over here at the little old school of Welch, where one teacher  taught eight grades.  And how many kids in the class?  Well, there was a lot of kids, you know. All the farmers    kids and stuff,  up to eighth grade.  How would you get there?  Walked. (Laughs)  And how far was that from your house?  Uhh    well, I   d say it was about a mile, a mile and a quarter.  What would you take for lunch?  We   d take sandwiches.  Well, with fifteen children...  8  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Yep.     your mother would be quite busy wouldn   t she?  Yep. Yep. Yep.  How did she do laundry for that many?  With a rub board, like this. (Gestures)  Rub board  Hanging clothes out in the wintertime, you   d freeze you know. I don   t  know how she done it all myself.  And bath time?  Yeah, we   d either take a bath out in the tub or go down to the river. It  wasn   t but about a quarter mile or so down there to the river and we   d  jump in there and take a swim in the summertime, but you couldn   t go  down there in the wintertime, you know.  So how would you do it in the wintertime?  Well, you   d have to boil the water and get in the tub. (Laughs)  Like one of the round number two tubs or whatever?  Yep. Yep.  Well, what was your favorite subject in school?  God, well you learned more by listening to what the grades ahead of you  did, you know.  That   s true.  But if you done stuff then you got your tail whipped, but now they can   t  even touch a kid.  No paddling.  Yep, that   s not right. That   s what   s the matter with kids right now.  Did you get paddled?  9  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Yep, lots of times.

Where did you go to high school?  Yeah, well when I was ten years old we moved to the big town of Salina.  All my brothers and stuff all got married away from the farm and I was  the oldest one there so my dad didn   t want just him and I doing all the  work so we got rid of the farm and moved to the town.  Oklahoma?  Well, yeah. Salina, over here, you know, over here about ten miles.  Okay, well let   s back up then. How did your parents come to be in  Oklahoma?  My dad   s mother was on the Trail of Tears. Cherokee.  Cherokee.  Yep. He was born down in Fort Gibson.  Okay.  That   s how come I   m here.  And then the farm was allotted, allotted land for them?  Yeah, they got land from the government. My dad and three of my  brothers and  one  sister all got land. I was born six years too late to get  any. I was born in    13 and they closed the roll  Dawes Rolls  when it   Oklahoma  became a state in nineteen      In     07.  Nineteen something. It was, I know, I think seven.  Well, were you in FFA or 4-H when you were in high school?

No. There was a club back then. It   d make quilts and stuff, you know.  Hang them down from the ceiling, you know. Go to one another   s house,  farmer   s house, and do one. Then they   d go to their house and do  another one. Yep.  So she sewed a little bit?  Yep. Yep. Well yeah, she sewed. You don   t have like these people  running around with all these (laughs) pants with holes in them and  stuff. She   d fix them. If I knew now, I could have made a fortune by  saving some them clothes. (Laughter) They cost more than regular ones  do. They do.  They do.  Yep, right.  Well, do you remember your first tractor?  My first what?  Tractor?  Well, we never had a tractor.  Sold the farm, okay     Nope, but I worked doing wheat harvesting, and they used tractors.   They used them to  grind the stuff up, the wheat, but we never had any.  What about your first car?  Model T. (Laughs)  New or used?  Huh?  11  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  New or used?  Used.  Used.  Yep.  Was church an important part of your childhood?  The Cherokee   s then?  Church?  Oh, the church.  Yeah.  We always went to the Methodist back there. It finally burned down and  they built another one. We only had two churches back then when I was  in school, but now they got, oh I don   t know, about fifteen or twenty.  Well, after high school what did you do?  Well, I quit school. I lacked what, two or three years, two years of  staying long enough. All three of us,  two friends and I , joined the  army. Well we didn   t have nothing to do, no way to make any money.  We didn   t make any in the army anyway, nineteen dollars a month. That  was a lot of money then.  Where were you stationed?  In Cheyenne, Wyoming.  That   s a little ways from Oklahoma.  Yeah. I was in there, and I didn   t like it and I wanted out. So I got out  five months and twenty-nine days. I got eighty-seven dollars travel.  Almost more money than I   d ever had in my life.  Did it take all of that to get home?  No. I rode the bus. (Laughs) It didn   t cost that much. You could buy  stuff cheap them days. Coffee you could buy for twenty-five cents a  pound and stuff.  12  Finchum  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  So, what year was that? That you were in the army.  Uh, let   s see. What was it?  Don   t look at me.  We left Salina in    36. It must have been thirty-two or three.  Kind of during the Depression time?  Yeah, well it was the Depression all the time I was raised up in. I  worked a lot of days driving a truck hauling gasoline for a dollar a day.  What do you call that?  You did what you had to do. Didn   t you?  Yep. Yep. Yep.  So World War II, you weren   t in the service during World War II.  No. I was building B-17 bombers.  Where were you doing that?  In Long Beach, California.  And how did you get from here to there to do that?  Well, we left Salina over here in 1936 and went to California. I had two  brothers out there. My dad wasn   t doing nothing here so they said come  out there. So we went out there.  So you were Okies from Oklahoma?  Okies from Oklahoma. Yeah. (Laughs)  And what was your job?  Out there?  Uh huh.  Oh God, I can   t tell you. I   d have to settle down and write you a whole  string. When I first went out there   my brother worked at the sugar mill.  We got out there on a Sunday, so he got me a job and I went to work the  next day, handling hundred pound sacks of sugar all day. Oh God, I  13  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Rod  don   t know. I picked oranges and lemons for twelve cents an hour and  ten cents a box. I picked walnuts. I done everything in the world. My  sister and I had a cleaners, and I was in the concrete business once. I   ve  done a lot of stuff.  Well when you were making the bombers what was your job? What part  were you doing?  Oh, I don   t know. I was doing four or five different parts. Sometimes I  was the boss and sometimes I was working   when they quit making,  you know during the war, that   s where I made my mistake. I was sent  down, only one out of the whole bunch that was working, to a guy down  there. They had just started making passenger planes. I sat down there  for two or three days and didn   t do nothing so I just said,    Why, I quit.     That   s where I should have stayed. That   s where I made my mistake.  Making more planes?  I could have had a lifetime job right there.  What did you do when you quit?  Well, I went to work for one of my wife   s brothers doing carpenter work  and stuff, in the concrete business.  We should back up and talk about how did you meet your wife?  Well a friend of mine, we went to a dance in California at the American  Legion one night and a friend of ours introduced us to a couple girls and  stuff. She was born in Arkansas and then moved to Elk City then they  moved to California and I met her. We was married for seventy-one and  a half years.  What year did you get married?  I don   t know. Go in there and look on the wall   then you can tell.  (Laughs)  June 8, 1939 in Yuma, Arizona.   When did you move back to Oklahoma?  Oh let   s see, 2002 I think.  So where did you live before you moved back here?  Yuma, Arizona.  14  Hampton  Finchum  Rod  Finchum  Rod  Finchum  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Rod  Finchum  Hampton  Yeah. I had insurance, and she didn   t have no insurance. I said,    We   d  go back here.    We   d move back here so we can get Cherokee insurance.  So that   s how come we   re here.  So you moved back to Oklahoma in 2002?  Four.  Two thousand and four?  November the twenty-second or third, after the...  So you were in California up until that time?  Yep. Yep.  No.  Well, no. We was over in Arizona and we was up in Oregon. We moved,  oh I don   t know, three or four times.  But Oklahoma   s home?  Yep. Yep. Yep. But people are sure a lot different now than they was  them days. Yeah. Them days if somebody got sick or something on the  farm, everybody went to help doing his work and stuff. Now they won   t  even do nothing. I got tired out there one day walking up to the corner  and back, and I leaned over my mailbox out there and four cars went by  and didn   t even stop or nothing. I mean the neighbors around in here,  they don   t care about you anymore.  That   s kind of sad isn   t it?  But them days, everybody helped one another and if a guy told you,    I   ll  be at your house at a certain time of the day,    he   d be there. But they  won   t do that now.  What would you do for entertainment and fun?  I don   t know. A lot of time we went to dances and stuff.  Barn Dances.  Barn dances, square dances?  Square dances, yep.  15  Finchum  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Rod  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Not ballroom dancing.  No, no. Square dancing. (Laughter)  Don   t know in Mayes County where you   d find a ballroom to dance in.  Square dance. (Laughter)  Even today you couldn   t find one.  And what was the music? I mean, did they have a band or     No. You   d have a guitar and a fiddle.  Oh, the fiddle.  Country and Western.  Old country music. (Laughs) Yep. You know you   d have so many in a  ring and stuff and have a caller. When we was in American Legion over  in Salina, we always   everybody had their own caller, you know. They  done their own calling stuff, but a lot of times they   d only have one  setting up there on the stage calling all of them, but we didn   t.  Sometimes you   d go to somebody   s house and they   d take out all the  furniture and dance all night. You ever do that?  No.  No, used to. Yep. They don   t do that anymore either.  She   s too young for that kind of stuff.  Huh?  She   s way too young for that kind of stuff. (Laughter)  I went with my grandmother clogging a couple of times.  Oh did you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they don   t do that much anymore either.  16  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Rod  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Rod  Hampton  Finchum  Rod  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Yeah.

He belonged to a bowling league.  Fishing and stuff.  So where in California were you?  Well, we moved to Orange.  Okay.  It was population five thousand people when we moved there and now it  must be what, half a million. (Laughs)  Too many.  You can   t tell when you get out of one town into another. Yep.  There   s probably five thousand people in that apartment building that   s  down the street from Wilson.  Yeah, I know. Yeah.  17  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Rod  Finchum  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Finchum  So when you retired, what were you doing?  I was doing heating and air conditioning.  Do you remember about what year that was, when you retired?  Let   s see. Seventy, seventy something I think.  Yeah, you broke your foot in     Yeah.  Let   s see. I was at Robinsons in Anaheim.  I worked in a factory that made heating and air conditioners.  Those came in handy in Oklahoma     Yep.  As hot as it   s been.  I haven   t done nothing since. (Laughs)  Probably    78, I think, is when he retired. Somewhere in that neck of the  woods. The first time.  The first time?  Yeah, he got a part-time job working at a car auction.  Yeah, after that.  Just for something to do.  The guy second door from me, worked over there where they had a car  auction, over there you know. He got me to go over there working one  or two days and then finally I got to working four or five. You know,  part-time and stuff, but something to do. Making a little extra money.  Then when he moved to Arizona, he quit and they   ve sent him a pension  check every month since, which he didn   t expect. He didn   t know he  was going to get that.  So in Arizona, were you in a retirement community?  18  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  No, we had a house. Yep.  And you picked Arizona for any particular reason?  Huh?  The reason you chose?  Oh yeah, well because a barber friend of mine was going to move out  there. He got me going out there one time, and my wife went out there  and we played golf and stuff. He bought a house out there and he got me  to come out there so I bought one and moved out there, too. And one  year out there it was 128 degrees, but he   s still there.  One of your niece   s husband     Huh?  Who was that guy that did the tile work with Joe? He   s related to Elmer  wasn   t he?  Elmer, yeah. I don   t know, yeah. But that   s it.  So sort of some family sort of, kind of.  Yep.  Kind of, sort of.  So it finally got too hot for my wife so we moved back to California.  Then from there we moved here.  It was cooler there than it is here.  Well, yeah. So that   s it.  How many children did you have?  That one  Rod  and a daughter. I got two granddaughters and one great-granddaughter.  That   s enough. (Laughter) Nobody got in trouble so  can   t ask for anything better than that either.  No.  Nope.  19  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Rod  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Who was the disciplinarian?  Huh?  Who did the discipline?  Well, there wasn   t very much, but    (Laughs)  Mother.  They were good kids.  Yep, yep. We never had any trouble at all. If one of these kids, if one of  them ended up being arrested and starts crying and stuff, out the door  they   d go. But now they turn them loose or let them cry or get out on the  floor. Get down there with their hands on the floor and then put their  hands in their mouth and stuff. They don   t know that they could pick up  stuff off the floor. Mine never done that. Yep.  Teach them right.  I   ve got two good kids, two good granddaughters, and that one up there.  (Gestures to photograph)  And they keep you on your toes.  Yep, yep. That one up there calls me Papa. (Laughs)  Well did you ever think you would live to be one hundred?  Nope. Nope.  Nope. Not at     Nope, not when I was growing up.  Well when you reached ninety-nine did you think    I   m going to do it   ?  Well, yeah I figured then, but   (Laughs)  Of all your brothers and sisters did any of them make it to one hundred?  No, let   s see. My dad was ninety-four and my mother was ninety-six,  and I got one brother that was ninety-seven.

Well, I don   t know, but they   ll go over there and one of these days  they   re going to do like that airplane that they can   t find. When they lost  it, I said they   d never find it.  Well, today on a typical day what do you do?  Do what?  On a typical day today, what do you do?  Like I   m doing right now.

His great-grandfather.  Did I miss a great? I may have. Great-grandfather.  You have any fond memories of your mom or     Any what?  Any fond memories of your mother or father or anything you  remember     Well, only thing, my granddad always done for breakfast, he always  drank a hot cup of water. Now why, I don   t know. He wouldn   t drink no  coffee or nothing else just hot water. Every morning. Now what that  does, I don   t know.  I guess you can   t afford the coffee. (Laughter)  How old did he live to be?  I don   t know. Rod do you remember how old Granddad was?  Which one?  Your mother   s dad.  My mother   s dad?  Well no.  Your mother   s dad?  My mother   s dad? Grandpa Roberts.  26  Rod  Finchum  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Bishop  Hampton  Bishop  Hampton  Bishop  Hampton  Bishop  Hampton  Finchum  I think he was in his nineties.  So that may be the secret then. Drinking hot water     Nobody else did it.  Yeah, well there   s some other people that does, too, I found out. Why  they do, I don   t know.  None of your family did though.  No. No. I know that. You can take my dad into a restaurant in the  morning and he   d always want coffee but tell them,    Don   t bring it until  you bring my food.    (Laughter)  You had a story last time I was here about your father and a hat?  (Laughter)  Oh yeah. (Laughs) What that guy did that night would   ve got him  thrown in jail.  What did he do?  Well, over there in Salina, him and another friend over there used to go  quail hunting. So one day they came back from quail hunting and they  was right in the middle of town over there. There was a whole bunch  standing around, you know, and everybody got to talking and stuff. Dad  had a shotgun. Well, the other guy did, too and one of the guys had a  brand new straw hat on. So one of the guys there picked this guy   s hat  off his head and throwed it up in the air and said,    John, lookie there.     And Dad shot the whole top out of it right in the middle of town and  pretty soon this guy got Dad   s hat and put it up there and set it on fire.  (Laughter) Now they   d been throwed in jail for shooting it right there in  the middle of town, wouldn   t he? Yeah.  Did he get him a new hat?  Huh?  Did he buy him a new hat?  Nope. He bought his own. Well, I could have took a shotgun or anything  with me to school if I wanted to in those days. You don   t bother nothing.  We took knives and played mumble peg and stuff, you know.  Played     27  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Finchum  Hampton  But now, mumble peg, you know? You put the knife and open it up. You  know, you flip it down and stick in the ground and stuff. Oh you know,  your nose or head or stuff, you know. You never did that?  No.  Oh God, that   s a lot of fun. (Laughter)  I keep telling you she   s not old enough for that stuff. (Laughter) She  may not have even pitched pennies.  Huh?  I said, she may not even know what pitching pennies is.  Nope, no, no. No, you just take a knife like this, you know and put like  this and drop it down there and you stick it in the ground, you know, and  stuff. Or anything you wanted to.  And how did you know if you won or didn   t?  Well, if you didn   t     It stuck in the ground for one thing.  Yeah. (Laughs)  Huh     Oh, we played a lot of things at school. Throwed snowballs and  everything else, you know. Now every time it snows that deep they  won   t have no school. God, we went to school when snow was that deep  (gestures) and we   d walk.  It doesn   t snow as thick as that thing is thin around here and they cancel  school.  Well, I know that. Why, I don   t know.  Bunch of wimps.  People don   t carry pocket knives anymore either.  No, I know it. I know it.  28  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Finchum  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Finchum  Rod  Hampton  Bishop  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  TSA owns them all.  See you   re not supposed to carry one like that, that won   t open without  you doing this, you know, but I already got one. But I have a big one  down there. Same way.  Grandpa and Uncle John use theirs to clean out their pipes.  You got to press that before you close it.  Clean out their pipe?  Yeah.  Yeah, my dad used to smoke a pipe. Cigars     Spent more time messing with them than they ever did smoking them.  (Laughter)  They   d puff a couple of times then they   d go out. Then they   d set there  and play with it for five minutes or so. Then they   d go again.  None of my kids smoke cigars, pipes, or tobacco.  Did you ever have any family traditions or customs that go back to the  Cherokee, your Cherokee heritage or anything?  No. We never had nothing. Nuh-uh. No. I   ve been back to where the  Trail of Tears is. We   ve got some kinfolk still buried back there. In that  track that   s got all them houses in it now just out of Atlanta, Georgia.  So that   s Duluth?  They owned a whole bunch of land there. The government took that  away from them. Her and two of her kids are buried on one lot out there.  Our line through his father and then grandmother goes through the  Cordery line and up the Cordery line comes the Rogers, which is Will  Rogers, that line. And she, this lady that   s buried there and I can   t think  of her name now, but it will come to me maybe before you leave. She  was married to one of the Rogers and her and two of the kids are buried  on this little     Little hill.  29  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Rod  I call it a little knoll, and they put all these expensive houses in there.  Well, they was going to tear  the graves  up, but a guy in genealogy  there in town went to the state and got them to fix it where they can   t  build on that lot. So there   s one lot among all the houses setting there.  Well, some guy was going to build a house on it, you see.  They   re marked by flat stones.  My wife and I was back one time, and I stopped and talked to some  policemen there and I asked them where the street was and they told me.  So I was down that way looking and one of them came down and he  said,    Follow me and I   ll show you where it   s at.    So we got down there  and it was up on a little knoll. My wife said,    Well I can   t get up there,     and the policeman said,    No. I   ll help you up there.    He said,    I never  knew this was up here. I   ll have to tell my kids.    And they   re still buried  there. It didn   t have no stone, you know. It had rocks and stuff in there,  and some guy was gonna build a house on that one, but they can   t now.  That Rogers had something like twelve hundred acres there.  They   d do anything to deal with the Indian. They took all that whole  thing away from them and it   s just houses all in there.  It   s just across the river there, the Chattahoochee.  Well, my grandmother and great-grandmother was on the Trail  of  Tears  and my grandmother was what? Two years old, wasn   t she, I  think.  Somewhere around there  And her mother carried her most of the way.  Did they pass any stories down to you from that experience?  Well, no. I didn   t know anything about it for years and years so. He done  most of the     Research?  To find out about it. Yeah.  There was a lot of stuff that never got talked about. I found out all kinds  of interesting tidbits after the fact. I mean, you thought a cousin was a   full  blood cousin and turns out it was half instead of the whole. Part of  30  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Finchum  the picture wasn   t like you saw it, but nobody ever said nothing about it.  I mean, all kinds of stuff.  And then the government, to build a railroad back there on the land, they  gave the railroad every section of land, every other section of land they  build a railroad on there. After the Cherokees, they took them out of  there and they finally got settlement on it. They sold all that land for  three cents an acre. My dad and my brother and sisters got, I think, a  hundred and some dollars a piece out of it. (Laughs) That   s what you  call a government. Then they come out here and give them fourteen  counties in this whole state and they said this is yours as long as the  grass grows and the water flows. It   s still growing and the water   s  flowing, and they took all this away when they had that Run out there.  That   s the reason they   re called sooners. That used to belong to the  Cherokees, and they took all the land, most all of it here. The only one  that got the land is the Osages up here. They got the rocky land up there.  Well, nobody wanted that land. That   s why they got to keep it.  And they got oil  (Laughter) Each one up there gets a check every  month.  You can   t plant nothing up there.  No, but they got oil. They got money. Used to buy a car and something  go wrong with it, they   d just dump it and buy another. They did, you  know. You   d find cars along the side of the road and stuff.  That was back then when you could buy a brand new Model T for what?  Four hundred bucks.  Yeah, well yeah. When I was growing up you could get a new car for  three or four hundred dollars. That is if you had the money. Yep.  Well with fifteen kids in the family, you guys didn   t have the money.  Why no, we didn   t.  And they didn   t sell buses then. That   s what they   d have needed was a  bus. (Laughter)  Well, the way my dad done back there he gave each one of us kids so  many rows of cotton, and we picked the cotton. The price we could get  for that cotton, we got a little spending money.  Where was the cotton gin?  31  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Bishop  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Bishop  Hampton  Bishop  In Pryor.  In Pryor.  And they had one in Salina, but mostly they had one in Pryor. They  don   t have them anymore. That   s the reason they don   t raise corn or  cotton or wheat or nothing around here anymore.  Yeah     You go out in the western part over here now, they do that.  What would you spend your money on?  Well, I don   t know. I didn   t have too much, you know. My brother  would get part of it. One of my older brothers would get part of it.  I thought you just said Grandpa give you     Well he did, but Mom would take care of it and they   d get money from  her and probably never get it back. We wouldn   t get a whole lot, but you  know.  Well you   ll never get it back. She   s dead and so are most of them or all  them are too.  Yep. Yep. Whatever.  You talked last time too about a, in Salina, about a bank robbery.  Yeah well, yeah the bank robbery, the little bank over there. Oh, I don   t  know how much money they had. They don   t have a lot of money  anyway. I had another friend who walked in there one day when it was  being robbed, and he was the first one in and found what it was. He  ducked under my arm and out the door he went. He went hurrying up the  street hollering,    Bank being robbed. Bank being robbed.    So they got  the money and took off. Got one of them, the driver, coming back  through town that afternoon and they had him tied in the bank, you  know, asking him all those questions, you know. He finally told them  where the other two would be, his brother and some other guy, and they  caught them in up in Saint Louis  Missouri  somewhere up there asleep.  Then, the next time it was being robbed we was back behind the bank on  the corner down there watching it, you know, when they come out. Yep.  Was Salina kind of a crazy criminal town back in the day?  32  Hampton  Bishop  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Bishop  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Well, it was a pretty rough town.  Was it?  Yep. Yep. There was a lot of fights going on and stuff. A couple of guys  down there one time, was about five or six of us setting on the curb  down there and a couple of them was drinking a little bit. They got in an  argument and stuff and one of them took a knife and just done this away  (gestures across stomach) and it just fell out. He had to hold him like  that until they brought an ambulance from Vinita  Oklahoma  to pick  him up.  That   s not a very good conversation piece. (Laughs)  Huh?  I said that   s not a very good thing to bring up for a conversation.  Well, I was just telling you how Pryor was     Just say he got cut and they had to wait for ambulance to get there from  Vinita, which was probably a day or two back then. (Laughter)  That happened, so.  The times were really different back then.  Absolutely. Yep. Yep. Yep.  Well, when he was a kid they had telephones, but the operator knew  everybody in town and she knew where everybody was, too. You say,     Ring Joe   s house for me,       Oh Joe   s over at Martha   s.    Then she   d just  connect you over there, you know. (Laughter)  Well you do. You just did this way and said    Miss, give me so and so   s  house.    That   s all you had to do. And when we lived on the farm  everybody had phones but it was all one. Every time when it would ring,  it was all one and you couldn   t have no secret. Every time the phone  would ring, everybody would get on there and listen to who it was.  How would you know if it was for you? Two rings and one long     Oh my God, I don   t remember.  A long ring, two short or something?  33  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Bishop  It was just the rings.  Oh, I don   t remember.  Pretty much everyone ignored that and picked it up just to see what was  going on.  Yep. Yep. Same way with Salina. You called there and said,    Give me  so and so   s house.    They didn   t have no street numbers on the streets  down there either.  No street names.  No names. The guy said,    Where does so and so live?       Well you go  down there to so and so and see the brick laying there and that   s where  you turn and lives down there.    That   s the way you do it. Nobody locked  their house, didn   t have locks on the door even. Nobody stole nothing.  If they did they wouldn   t live long enough to tell about it.  Yep. Well     Especially if they stole an animal like a cow or a horse.  You had a lot more fun them days than you do now. You could do a lot  of stuff, firecrackers and stuff you know. You could buy a whole bunch  for  a little . If you had quarter you could buy ones to shoot all day. Now  what? You can   t buy one for a quarter anymore. And they won   t let  them shoot a firecracker works on the fourth of July in the state of  Oklahoma.  No, you can   t have a public display. Now I can   t understand that one one  iota. There   s a lot of stupid laws in this state but that one I don   t  understand.  Fireworks during the Fourth? Supposedly you can   t have one on the  fourth of July in the state of Oklahoma.  Well, the whole idea of the fourth of July is to celebrate it, not the day  before or after. I   d like to meet that yea-who, but I   m sure he   s dead or  her or whatever it was.  Same way when beer first came out you know.  Do you remember those prohibition days?  34  Hampton  Bishop  Hampton  Rod  Bishop  Hampton  Bishop  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Finchum  Yep. You could buy a bottle of beer for a dime, and if you was in a place  where every time the guy came around delivering with the beer and stuff  he   d give you all you could drink for nothing.  Now was bootlegging a problem up in through here?  Yep. Yep. There was bootleggers all over the country. Go up there and  buy whiskey for a dollar a gallon.  So that   s big business.  Yes. Muskogee was big.  Huh?  Muskogee was a big bootlegging area.  All these places was, you know, around here. Yep. And some of them  made home brew up there, too. You could buy that for ten cents a bottle.  Yep.  The guy up there in Salina was the bootlegger, plus he owned the liquor  store in town.  Yep, yep.  So he covered both sides of the tracks.  I run around with a friend over there all the time, and he sold a little  liquor every once in a while and stuff, and him and I drank and stuff. I  found out his son lived here and I   d never seen his son before, so he met  me down at the restaurant one day and he asked me what his dad done. I  finally got around and I said,    Well he sold a little bump.       My dad was  a bootlegger?    I hadn   t seen the guy since. (Laughter)  One of your uncles got arrested over in Arkansas for running     Yep. He was a boozer. Yep.  Running moonshine.  That was no   no shame about that. A lot of people sold it.  And you called it what?  35  Hampton  Finchum  Bishop  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Bishop  Hampton  Rod  Bishop  Hampton  Bishop  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Bootlegging.  No, you said he sold a little     Moonshine.  Moonshine?  No, you called it something else. A little     What?  Oh, homebrew?  Homebrew. Yeah. Homebrew yeah.  That   s beer. Two different things.  Yeah, that   s two different things. My dad made the homebrew one time  and he told me he bottled it a little bit too green. It exploded in there,  and it had foam in there about that deep. (Laughs) Yeah     I don   t think they probably did much bathtub gin in Oklahoma, but     A lot of people sold whiskey and stuff in the days and stuff. They   d do  anything to make a living.  Now did they have pop-up little flea market stores around this area?  No. No.  Are you talking about the bootleggers?  Well, some people would have     No.     down in Muskogee, I think, would have     No, I think it was more the    you had to you know somebody that knew  somebody    to tell you where to go.  Yeah.  Like you said, like the woman     36  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  If you want to know what   s going on in a town, just ask a guy driving a  cab. He can tell you. They can. If you want to know anything and you  drive in a new town then you ask him what does he know and he   ll tell  you.  There was a taxi cab in Salina?  No.  I didn   t think so.  What I mean, that   s got them, you ask one and he   ll tell you what   s  going on or where stuff is and everything else.  Don   t try that in New York.  They got to know. Yep.  What was your favorite meal that your mother cooked for you?  I don   t know. Anything, I guess. (Laughter)  Had to be chicken?  Well yeah, she cooked chicken. Cooked steak, you know and if you   d  want some ham or something she   d have a big sack like that and put all  that in there and hang it up in the smokehouse and cut you off some and  go in and cook it. Eggs, when we had chicken and all that stuff, you  know.  You actually had a smokehouse?  Yep. Yep.  Smoked it.  Yep and every time one of the farmers would start either killing hogs or  cows, well everybody would come and help him, and they   d get part of  the meat. Then they   d do the same thing so they just keep on doing it  you know. So everyone helped one another. Now they won   t help  nobody. They won   t.  Well for refrigeration, what would they use?  Well, we didn   t have any.  37  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Finchum  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  That   s what I thought.  Well, a lot of people had cellars and stuff and they   d put it in there  because it   s a little cooler and stuff down in there.  Or can it?  Yeah.  Canned the meat, too?  Yep. Yep and they   d smoke it in the smokehouse and you wouldn   t need  nothing. It   d all be in the smokehouse.  Well your mother had to can quite a bit in order to feed that many kids  in the winter.  Absolutely. Yep. She done it all by herself and washed all those clothes  with a rubboard. I don   t know how she done it.  That   s probably the reason she      I bet you couldn   t get women to do that now.  You bet she what?  I said I bet you couldn   t get women to do that now. (Laughter)  The Amish do.  A rubboard?  Yeah. Huh?  Amish do.  Who?  Amish     Well yeah. They   re different I guess, but I mean     Well if the electricity would go away it wouldn   t bother the Amish one  bit.  Well no. It wouldn   t bother them.  38  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Bishop  Hampton  Bishop  Hampton  Bishop  Hampton  Bishop  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Bishop  They   d still eat and thrive just like they have been for eons.  Well their housing and stuff they use them for churches. They don   t  even pay property tax on that house. Maybe I   ll turn this into a church.  (Laughter)  So you   ve been told.  You never seen nobody like me, have you? (Laughter)  What   s your motto in life?  Oh I don   t know.  Or your philosophy? Do you have something, a philosophy you live by  or a motto?  No. I just like to have fun. (Laughs)  If history were to be written today, what would you want it to say about  you?  Would what now?  If history were written about you today, what would you want it to say?  Well it could say that I never done anything that I was ashamed of, but  I   ve done a lot of stuff I wouldn   t do, but I   m not ashamed of it. I don   t  know. I   ve had a good life.  Sounds like it.  I   ll tell you, I   ve always said you can always see somebody worse off  than you are. Younger. He hadn   t had to take me to the bathroom or  push me around yet. I don   t know. (Laughs). I hope he will or I hope I  don   t have to. I like to have fun like anybody else.  Did you play practical jokes on people?  Well some, yeah. (Laughs) Yep. I   ve got a lot of stuff I could tell you,  but I better not. (Laughter)  And it   s obvious that you   re still a parent. Even at a hundred you   re still  a parent.  39  Hampton  Bishop  Hampton  Bishop  Rod  Bishop  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Finchum  Hampton  Rod  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Rod  (Laughs)  Right?  Yep. (Laughter)  I think you   d agree, right?  Well, now who   s the boss?  Who   s the boss? (Laughs)  She   s up there.  This here would be the boss. My younger sister. (Laughter)  Or she thinks she is.  If she   s not available, then let   s see. This one here will take over and this  one here thinks she   s the boss, but I   ll leave the rest of that alone about  her. (Laughter) It   s not good when you have three A personalities. All  three are always right.  Yep.  My sister still thinks to this day that I   m making it up that Oklahoma has  three/two beer. She   s says,    Why in the world would a brewery make  beer just for one state?    I said,    Don   t ask me. I wouldn   t.    She says,     That can   t be. That   s just not right.     Anything you want to add before we close out?  No, that is enough I think.  He   s looking at you for a prompt like,    Do you have anything else?     She   s running out of questions.  Did they treat you pretty well in California being from Oklahoma?  Yeah, far as I know.  Okie wasn   t a derogatory word?  Well for a lot of people it was but it didn   t bother me.  It depended on where you were.  40  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  Rod  Hampton  They always say,    Okie       what is it? Okie from Muskogee, that   s a     That was written on a bus on a napkin.  Yeah. Another guy and a friend of his were on a bus going towards  Muskogee one day, and this guy happened to look over there and said,     Muskogee.    So they started writing that song and they got it wrote  before they got to Muskogee.  On a napkin.  Yep. Okie from Muskogee. Yep. Merle Haggard.  There were signs all over California about Okies.  Merle and a friend of his     He already had brothers out there and that made a difference, you see.     wrote that on a napkin on the bus.  They weren   t camped out on the shoulder of the road and stuff, see.  Yeah.  It   s just like when he was a kid, they had signs over there in Salina, I  think Pryor ,too that said, I won   t use the wording they used but the  black people better be gone before the sun goes down.  They did too. The only ones that we ever seen over there, they come  over when they had ties that go under the tracks to be loaded on the  boxcars. They   d come over and load them. Before that sun went down  they was gone, Pryor and Salina both. They still got I don   t know how  many towns in Oklahoma that   s black.  Not as many as there used to be.  Well no, but there   s quite a few yet. Yep.  There is.  There was a big KKK  Klu Klux Klan  outfit here in Pryor.  What got me about the blacks, they   re just as good, I guess, as anybody.  They   ve got to make a living and stuff. We had some my wife   s kinfolks  41  Finchum  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  over in Arkansas. We was over there one time and we was down at the  courthouse and the drinking water on one side of that in there was for  the blacks. It was hot water. The other side was cold for the whites.  That   s not right either.  No.  But they done it.  That was in the fifties.  Yep.  Or the early sixties, one of the two.  And used to my wife   s dad and them when they lived here, they   d go  back to Arkansas on a train. When a train pulled into Arkansas the train  stopped and all the blacks had to get up and go to the back. That wasn   t  right either, but what could you do about it.  How about the porters on the train because there was a lot of blacks that  were porters on the trains?  Well, I don   t know.  Did they have to quit working and go in the back?  I guess they did.  That makes no sense.  That   s what they said. I never rode it, but they did all the time and stuff.  Said it always stopped before it got to the border and     You rode the train just not inside.     sent the blacks all to the back. Same thing with streetcars and stuff. I  rode streetcars a lot of the time and they   re in the back.  He didn   t tell you about his freight train ride?  But what could you do about it. Nothing. Yeah, I don   t know how many  black towns there are now. They   re griping but we never brought them  over here. Their own people got them over here and sold them for  slaves, which they shouldn   t have done but they did.  42  Rod  Hampton  Rod  Hampton  Finchum  Hampton  Finchum  You see that   s the problem. They brought them over here to sell them  and then who bought them?  Well, yeah.  That   d be white people.  Well, whatever.  I think that   s a topic for another day. So I will thank you for sharing  your story with us today.  Well, a lot of people probably wouldn   t want to read that.  It was great.  -------  -------
