Speaker 1: I wanna start out by asking you about your mother, her name was Winnie?
Speaker 2: My, my mother is a wonderful woman.  She--her name is Winifred Adams Riggs.  Her middle name is Doris.  Adams was a maiden name, Riggs.  She's still alive today.  She is going to be ninety-one next month.  She is a gorgeous woman, and she's just a fabulous person.  She, she's got a lot of energy.  She lives by herself.  She lives in New Jersey, right, right across the bridge right by the bridge and she gets up and goes and takes the bus and comes to Manhattan and goes downtown on the subway, takes the buses.  She likes shopping.  She likes to spend money.  Gorgeous lady.
Speaker 1: Now can you--do you know about her back--did she ever tell you about her growing up in Pan, Panama, right?
Speaker 2: Right, that's right.
Speaker 1: Does she talk about that at all?  I mean, you were born in Panama yourself?
Speaker 2: I was born in Panama as well.  And the thing on how that all came about, my, my, my, my paternal and maternal grandparents came to Panama to build a canal.  That's where the only work was in the Caribbean region.  My maternal grandparents came from Barbados, and my paternal grandparents came from Jamaica.  So, I've got this wonderful mixture of being half Jamaican and half Bajan, born in Panama and I spent most of my life, not all of my life right here in Harlem [New York, New York], so I think the best of all worlds.  Regarding what my mother told me a lot about her upbringing, she's told me quite a bit of things about that and we, we handled some of the things that she's told us.  A little bit about her upbringing, her brothers, her one sister who we lived with for a little while when she was here.  She brought us up here, actually, back in '50 [1950] and it was an interesting background.  The thing that I really remember about what she talked to us about is how her mother really didn't like my dad [Eric Riggs] at all.  She used to chase him away with a broom.  She didn't want this guy messing with her daughter, you know.
Story_ID: 179081
Speaker 1: How would you describe your mother [Winifred Adams Riggs]?
Speaker 2: She's, she is a very energetic woman, very family-oriented.  She was a seamstress, I think she only went to eighth grade, and very, very wise woman, very wise.  A lot of proverbs.  You know we grew up with a lot of verbs, so we know about all these little symbolisms that they use all the time.  So you hear them from time to time.  You hear them and you listen to them and you say, you know, you grow up thinking and my sister and I said what is she talking about.  Even my dad what's he talking about, what.  All of a sudden it starts making sense when you start getting older.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me what some of those were?
Speaker 2: Oh, some of them were, for instance we were just talking about something the other day about the yields of the parents will always fall back on the kids, and we never really knew what that meant, but we started having our own children and moving on we started seeing things with our friends and other relatives and then you start to see how it all makes sense.  That's one of the things.
Speaker 1: Any others?
Speaker 2: African proverbs.  A man that has no history has no future.  This was their way of telling us that education is the way to go and to motivate you to get into the flow of trying to make life better for yourself down the road even though you can't see it, but you should be working towards some goal.  So, those are some of the kinds of things that--there's a lot of Caribbean and Western Indian symbolisms and, and that you hear.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me?
Speaker 2: They, they, they don't all come to mind right now, but probably a lot of it is something that we do every day so, and we talk about it every day so it's not as though you could just pull it out of the air and, and say this is what it is.  You see, but it has given us a lot of pause over the years and in a lifetime of growing up.
Story_ID: 179082
Speaker 1: Now, your father, can you give his name?
Speaker 2: Eric Antonio Riggs.
Speaker 1: So are you a junior of sorts?
Speaker 2: No I'm not a junior actually.  My--I had a brother who was a junior.  He was the first of three children born in the marriage between my mother [Winifred Adams Riggs] and my dad.  And it was an unfortunate situation with him.  He was being brought to my mother's bedside in the hospital and somehow, and we don't know what the details are today, somehow he happened to slip out of the nurse's hand and he fell on his head and that killed him instantly.  So, he was the first.  He was Eric Antonio, Jr.  Then my sister came two years after that, and I came two years after she did.  We say two years, it's been about a year and eight months and my dad never wanted to go that route again to name me Eric, although that's a name that I just absolutely love.
Speaker 1: So you were--
Speaker 2: I'm not a junior.
Speaker 1: So you were the, the youngest of that union, you're the baby?
Speaker 2: I'm the baby.  I'm the one.
Speaker 1: And your father do you know much about his background?
Speaker 2: Sure.  He was a, he retired here.  He used to be a longshoreman.  He was a dental technologist actually.  He was a dental technician for many years, and that didn't have any influence on me going into the field of dentistry.  It didn't at all.  He didn't want to force that on me, although that's what he really wanted, but I came upon it.  Honestly, I came upon it on my own, but he had left that business and wanted to be a longshoreman because he was paying the bills and he felt that he needed additional monies to do those things.  We were getting older, and we were growing up and shoes were getting more expensive and clothing was getting more expensive and I used to be a chubby kid, you know, and I used to eat a lot.  You know they always used to tell me that I need, they needed to buy a whole cow for me because I used to drink milk all the time incessantly, all day long, just drinking milk; that's all I drank.  So, he became a longshoreman in his early days back in Panama as much as he would tell me and I know that this is--he wouldn't tell me a lot of things because of the nature of what he was involved in.  He used to be on, on the staff of one of the dictators in Panama many, many years ago and although he never really came out and said exactly what he did I know what he did.  I'm a military guy, so I know what happens in what we have to do in going about doing what we do on a daily basis on the military side of things including this conflict that we're going through right now.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: And you don't talk about those things.  You know, you hear the jokes in movies sometimes, you know, if I tell you I have to kill you, you know; you hear those things.  So, he never said a lot.  Even my mother didn't know.
Story_ID: 179083
Speaker 1: Now both--are--am I correct both, were both of your parents [Winifred Adams Riggs and Eric Riggs] born in Panama, but they came from--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --they were born in Panama.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: But their, their parents were--
Speaker 1: --from other
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: --from, from other, from --(unclear)--Jamaica.  So you lived there until you were seven is that correct?
Speaker 2: Five.
Speaker 1: Five, okay, I thought you--so do you have memories of Panama?
Speaker 2: Very little.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very little and it's, it's the one country that I have always wanted to visit and go back to and I have never gotten back, not even in the military.  And it's so ironic that the entire family, my family has all gone back.  They've all gone back for one reason or another.  I have cousins who go back every year.  For whatever reasons, I just never went back.  It certainly wasn't because I didn't want to.  It was just that it's circumstantial that I never went back.  I've been all over the world, but and I haven't been to Panama.
Story_ID: 179084
Speaker 1: So, your earliest memory is of what?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory in Panama we lived on a street called 21 Street.  It's not like 21st Street here, right, right in Panama, right down in the middle of the street there and I remember us living upstairs only one flight up and it was a bal- it was a balcony up there and we used to, my sister and I used to peer from the balcony as you know how kids do and look through the little posts there and, and we used to watch the traffic and watch people and we'd go downstairs and play on the street corners.  They were really narrow street corners; I remember that.  And we lived half a block away from one of the large streets there called Central Avenue and we were really under controlled in terms of not going up there because of the traffic.  We could have gotten killed real easy.  Of course during the period of time it wasn't what we know it to be today.  The crime was, was not an issue.  Today's a different ball game.  This is really right after World War II [WWII], so during, during that period of time everybody was friendly.  Everybody loved you.  And I remember also the big thing that I really remember is going to the beach with my dad [Eric Riggs], and he used to put, sit on this, the banisters overlooking the sand.  It used to be so hot.  I remember dancing trying to get away from the heat and those are really good times.  And at a young age I, you know, those are some of the things that I remember.  I remember going to Catholic school.  I was going to Catholic school down there, and I also remember saying something sometime in one of my classes.  I don't know what it was that I said to this day, but I still remember how soap tastes (laughter).  I still remember how soap tastes.
Speaker 1: So you really--
Speaker 2: Whatever I said must have been, must have really been something.
Story_ID: 179085
Speaker 1: Now, do you remember--do you know what circumstances under which your, your family moved to New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: No, not, not really except that there was going to be as I found out years later, there was going to be a change in administration in the, in the running of, of the government in Panama and apparently it was not going to be a good change.  So, my dad [Eric Riggs] did what he had to do with his connections, was able to get passports for us and got us out.  Actually the three of us came up and my, my mother [Winifred Adams Riggs] and my sister and I came up in March, March 19, 1950; I still remember that day.  And my dad didn't come until October or November of that year.
Speaker 1: Okay, at--
Speaker 2: But other than, as far as the circumstances I really don't know.
Speaker 1: Was there any other, or were there any other family members already here when you came?
Speaker 2: My aunt, my mother's sister and that's who we lived with, right here on 117th Street.
Speaker 1: Do you know how, how, how much in advance she had come before you?
Speaker 2: No I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I think she had been here as best as could piece it all together she had been here about four or five years prior to that.
Speaker 1: Do you remember actually coming?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you describe that?
Speaker 2: We flew on a propjet, Braniff Airlines and one of the toys that I had growing up that I refused to get rid of for a long, long time until I was a teenager was a wooden plane and I used to take pencils and, and just try to emulate Braniff on the side of the pencils and you know pens, pens don't work well--(unclear)--pencils, but I did the best I could.  But, that was my toy, Braniff Airline, twin engines.
Speaker 1: Do you remember there being much anticipation on your part, you're going to a whole different country and--
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: --you don't
Speaker 2: I don't remember at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was all, it was all a trip, you know, everything is--
Speaker 1: Well you were young.
Speaker 2: Everything was a party, you know, when you're young.  Every time you're going out it was a party no matter where you were going and this was another one of those, those episodes.
Story_ID: 179086
Speaker 1: So, now where was your aunt living?  What was the address?
Speaker 2: She lived at 6 East 117th Street [New York, New York].  That's between 5th and Madison, which was an interesting block.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Sure.  In, in Manhattan [New York, New York], in Harlem [New York, New York] specifically, now there's Central Harlem where we are now and you know we pretty much live all over Harlem, but in that particular block and in some of the other blocks around there there's a de, demarcation between Harlem where African Americans live and on the other side of that where Hispanic community lived at that time.  We're talking about Puerto Ricans because those were the largest Hispanic immigrants at that time.  Today we're talking Dominicans and we're talking Mexicans and we're talking Salvador's and, and you name it, you know, they're here.  But, at that time, that street that I lived on the upper half of the block was pretty much Hispanic between Madison and Fifth.  The lower half closer to Fifth Avenue was pretty much African American and a lot of Caribbeans and West Indians as well.  The top half of the block they were black Hispanics.  There were white Hispanics or lighter Hispanics and they used to fight each other because of the whole racial connotation of light skinned, dark skinned, you know, that conflict was there on the Hispanic side of the block.  We went to school on Madison Avenue, which meant we had to go up--we lived on the bottom half of the block--we had to go up to the top half of the block and not only did the light Hispanics and Black Hispanics fight each other up there, but the whole top of the half of the block Hispanics used to fight the whole bottom half, which were blacks.  We had a different problem.  We were black as you can see who lived on the bottom half of the block, not a problem, but we didn't speak English.  We spoke Spanish.  So, we had a problem on the bottom half of the block.  We had a problem on the top half of the block and we had to go up to the top half to go to school.  So, we learned how to juggle.
Speaker 1: Oh what were--do you remember your neighbors or you know who else was on the block?
Speaker 2: There was, there was a guy who lived in my building who we became best friends.  We found out that we were born the same day, the same year.  We became best friends.  We were in Cub Scouts together.  We used to go to church together and as we started getting older, became teenagers, we started doing different things.  He started working downtown, and I started playing music.  I started playing football.  I started playing--running track.  My life took a different turn, and his life took a different turn, and we grew up and got out of high school again we went different directions.  I came out of high school playing music, and that's what I used to do.  I was a jazz musician.
Story_ID: 179087
Speaker 1: I wanna take you back though to that block, you know, in your sort of early years here in which you were still, you know, young and I want you to tell me what sights, smells, you know, and sounds--or sounds--remind you of growing up in Harlem [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: My block also was a diversion for public transportation.  Every now and then buses would come through my block.  They would come from downtown, come uptown to Madison Avenue and maybe 116th was the last stop.  They'd come up to 117th street, then make that U-turn and turn around and get back on Fifth Avenue and keep going back downtown, so I'd hear buses all the time.  We used to hear that all the time.  We used to play stickball.  We'd play football.  We ran track, played ringalevio, tag, all these games that kids play up and down the streets in between all of this traffic.  In fact, we used to use the buses as part of our camouflage either by running alongside the buses on the other side so that you couldn't be seen or dangerous activity is getting on the back of the bus.  A lot of us did that too.  So we used all of those sounds it was traffic.  The thing that reminds me more about, one of the things that really got me into jazz in the first place we're talking '50s [1950s] here.  We used to see, I used to see these guys coming up and down the street in trench coats, not buttoned, they were just pulled together and they had their belts just tied and their coats were not pressed they were just kind of ruffled.  They had what we learned later on to be afros.  They were wearing tams.  It was a totally different look, something that we weren't used to seeing or something I certainly wasn't used to seeing, but I liked it, I liked it.  They always had these bags, you know, these cases with them.  I didn't know what was in those cases.  As I found out later on, these guys were, they were jazz musicians.  They had their horns in the bag or they had their trumpets in there.  Even the bass players they were carrying their basses and rolling them up and down the street.  I liked that look.  There was something about that that just grabbed onto me, and I didn't know what it was until years later.  My father [Eric Riggs] got me involved in jazz when I was eleven.  I didn't know what it was.  I listened to it, and I just liked it.  I just liked the way it moved.  I liked the way it made me feel, and it's one of the things that just grabbed a hold on me and it has a hold on me today, to this day.  I don't play anymore.  Every so often I do, but it's just one of those things.  That's, that's something I'm gonna die with.
Speaker 1: Now, any smells?
Speaker 2: Yes, we had a lot of Caribbeans in our, in our community from different islands and then of course the Hispanic influence from upon the top of the block.  The Caribbean flavors, I mean, it was just, it was pungent.  Not pungent in the negative way, just pungent.  I mean, and you just loved coming in that block because you could--you got hungry coming up that block, up or down.  I mean, you come into the block and the aroma, the odors they were just coming and they just welcomed you into the block and you just wandered where is this coming from?  So, you do smell those foods and, and that's one of the real positive things about growing up on that street that stuck with me.  I spend time in the kitchen, not just eating.  I spend time in the kitchen.  I do, I, I love cooking.
Story_ID: 179088
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Winifred Adams Riggs] teach you how to cook?
Speaker 2: My mother taught me how to cook.  I picked up a few things just watching her.  Cooking is experimentation as you know.  Most people don't realize that.  It's experimentation, and it's a matter of blending seasonings and flavors and all kinds of things together.  We eat the same foods all over the world.  I've been all over the world, not all over the world, but I've traveled to many places and we eat the same foods.  It's prepared differently and each time you, you sample something from another side of the world it's the same thing, but--(unclear)--using other seasonings and it just really enlightens your, your, your reservoir, you know, for what you want and what you wanna do, how you like to do it.
Speaker 1: Now, you, your family did it take much adjustment, you know, I mean do you remember any period of adjustment?  I know you were young and kids can adjust earlier.
Speaker 2: Young, I was young.  Kids adjust to anything.  It doesn't take us long, but as far as my parents were concerned you could see that there was, that things weren't always happy like we used to know, but, you know, we became, we got into a flow and you noticed that life was a little difficult for them, just from seeing and hearing them saying that it's difficult and when my dad used to have to come in and work two jobs and then he started working three jobs and then my mother started working and she started working two jobs.  Then we realized this is a different situation, but we got used to it.
Story_ID: 179089
Speaker 1: Now, can you just share some childhood memories, you know, of growing up, you know, whether it's around, you know, just family times or holidays or, you know, just some memories.  I'm looking for before you were sort of in high school, but in that sort of period.
Speaker 2: Oh, we had a lot, a lot of experiences then and my friend Bobby [ph.] and I we got to be so close.  He was on a different plan.  I didn't understand what he was doing, but I just wanted a friend, and we were so close.  This is, this is something that you, you kind of go back to.  At six years old, you know, we stole our first box of cookies.  We went in the store, we wanted these cookies, and we just picked them up and walked out of the store.  We didn't think we had to pay for 'em, but we were so cute, you know.  My aunt came home from work and the guy down at the store told my aunt you know your nephew came in here and he got these cookies.  He and, he and that other kid that he's always hanging out with got these cookies and didn't pay for it.  It must have been about a dime.  Well, that was the most expensive box of cookies we ever stole.  I still feel it to this day.  She wore me out.  Bobby's mother wore him out.  And when my mother [Winifred Adams Riggs] came home she told my mother she wore me out.  My dad [Eric Riggs] came home and she told him.  Oh, I remember that.  It was a good lesson.  I remember we had our big first snow storm, the first snow storm we ever had.  Because in the Caribbean there's no, in Panama there's no, there's no snow, no changes in the weather.  We had snow and I didn't know what this was.  This was fun.  This was wow what is this.  I put on a pair of galoshes.  No shoes, no socks, nothing.  I didn't know.  Froze to death almost.  I remember that.  I did remember the, the games that I mentioned to you earlier ringalevio, stoop ball, stickball, all of those games.  We used to sit outside on the stoop sometimes like holidays, Fourth of July and just sit out on the stoop and just watch all the fireworks.  Kids across the street, up the block, down the block firecrackers and cherry bombs.  You know put the little cherry bomb on the ground and you put a soda can on top of it, you light it up, bomb and watch the can go up.  All those things were kind of fun and in summer months as well it was really, really hot and someone would turn on the, the fire hydrant.  They still do it today.  But, we didn't know where the beach was or how far it was to go to the beach.  We'd put on our bathing suits and just go right down to the corner where the fire hydrant was and that was our recreation.  That was our recreation.
Story_ID: 179090
Speaker 1: And what was family life like, you know, in your household?  You know you say your parents [Winifred Adams Riggs and Eric Riggs] were working, you have older siblings--
Speaker 2: --(Unclear)--and my, my sister and I basically kept each other going.  I had a cousin.  Oh, and my, my aunt's son.  He was older and he was a little different.  He was a little different.  He liked being in the streets, and at my young age I always knew he was always going to be trouble.  I came home one day, and he wasn't there because he got arrested breaking into somebody's car.  We didn't know what that was all about, but you know we always knew he was going to be different.  And I had another cousin who lived across the street between 5th and Lenox, lived in my wife's block.  And he was--his father was a musician, called himself Black Ben the Great. He used to be the number one calypso bandleader here in New York City during that time, and his son, my cousin, Ralph was musician.  After high school he went on with [HM] Harry Belafonte for twelve years, and I was playing music as well.   I was playing drums as well.  Ralph was more on the Caribbean commercial side, and I was really strictly on the jazz side, and Ralph went on to stick with it and he did very well.  Ralph MacDonald, Where is the Love, Mr. Magic, Just The Two Of Us.  That, that, was his thing.
Speaker 1: So, that your cousin?
Speaker 2: That's my cousin.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we had drummers in the family.  He was a drummer.  I was a drummer.  His father was a drummer.  My mother was an organist in the church.
Speaker 1: What church?
Speaker 2: In Panama, St. Paul Church in Panama.  And we got our piano lessons because of that, my sister and I, and my sister went on to play violin.  She was really very good.  She was better than I was, but I played more instruments than she did and very fulfilling kind of growing up.
Speaker 1: Do you remember when you had your first set of drums or you played your first?
Speaker 2: I had my first set of drums I must have been about twelve.  I had a set of red sparkle Gretsch with Zildjian cymbals.  You wouldn't know what that is unless, unless you were a musician, but I just had this vision in my head of these red sparkled drums.  When, when you go somewhere and the light hits the drums the sparkle just seem to glitter like diamonds, and when you hit the drums every time you hit it the vibration just made the light just kind of glitter and it was just really nice.
Speaker 1: Is that how you were introduced to music with your drums?
Speaker 2: No, I was introduced to music when I was seven playing piano.
Speaker 1: Piano, okay.
Speaker 2: And I didn't like playing piano because I had, I had a piano teacher that, and I think you can relate to this, and the piano teacher whenever you'd make a mistake he had a ruler and I said no I don't like this, I don't, I don't wanna do this anymore, so I just stopped playing piano for a while and when I went to junior high school I wanted to play trumpet because my dad used to take me to Lewisohn Stadium, which was the, a collegiate stadium for City College [of New York, New York, New York], which was right up the hill.  On the Fourth of July every year that was Louis Armstrong's birthday, and Louis Armstrong would always be there to play for his birthday.  I don't know if that was actually his birthday at that time or not, but it turned out it was.  Going to Lewisohn Stadium all I knew at eleven years old was that I wanted to play jazz, and I wanted to play a trumpet.  I wanted to play just like Louis Armstrong.  So, I got to junior high school, and I went right away to sign up for a music class, music for the band, and they told me that there weren't any more trumpet slots, everybody's gotten, gotten the trumpet spots and, but I do have this spot for a drummer, you might wanna do that for a while and maybe someone who's playing the trumpet may not like it in six, six months or six hours even, you might be able to switch off then, so I said well okay I'll do that with the intention that I'm gonna switch off and be a trumpet player in the six hours or six weeks, but the moment I got those drum sticks in my hand you couldn't tear me away from them.
Story_ID: 179091
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were talking about your first set of drums, you know, and that you were hooked from that point on, and I was asking you, you know, what hooked you?
Speaker 2: I was hooked from the first time I held the drum sticks in my hand.  I didn't even have drums then, but the moment I had those drum sticks in my hand and it started telling me how to play them and how to use the drum sticks in order to elicit different sounds there was no way that you're gonna get me away from playing drums, no way.  And I spent all of my time basically learning how to play this, these drums and learning how to read music and by that time I was just totally co-opted, totally.
Speaker 1: Your, your music lesson--were you in music lessons at school or did you have both?
Speaker 2: This was all in school.  The, the private lessons were the piano lessons that I stopped after getting my wrist smacked a couple of times; I stopped that, but this was, this was junior high school.
Story_ID: 179092
Speaker 1: First let's get--now you went where for elementary school?
Speaker 2: The, the--I went to public school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what P--
Speaker 2: PS 103 [Hector Fontanez, New York, New York] and that was on 119th Street and Madison Avenue, my neighborhood school, good school.  I can't tell you what I learned there, but good school.
Speaker 1: And then--
Speaker 2: --a lot of nice kids there.
Speaker 1: and then junior high school (laughter) where was that?
Speaker 2: Junior high school was Booker T. Washington, that BTW 54, J.H.S. 54 [New York, New York] where my, my musical--that's on the Columbus Avenue at 107th Street.
Speaker 1: That's a famous junior high school.
Speaker 2: Probably never see it at BTW.
Speaker 1: No, but there's, okay.
Speaker 2: Junior high and high school.
Speaker 1: Right, but I talked to someone who was president of Booker T. Washington, I mean principal.
Speaker 2: That's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Later--
Speaker 2: I, I wouldn't know who they are now.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: But that was the school that I credit with getting me into music, really getting me to a point at a stage where I was comfortable, out of that experience--
Speaker 1: Who was the bandleader then?  Who, who, do you know who it was?
Speaker 2: Mr. Roth, R-O-T-H.
Speaker 1: And, and what was the racial makeup of the school?
Speaker 2: It was, I'd say it was probably about 50 percent white and probably 25 percent Hispanic, and the other 25 percent blacks.  So, it was a predominately white school, although there was a mix.  It, it was good.  It was good.  I had my first episode in that environment, which I never had before where they, a teacher--I had this teacher for the social studies class and also for the English class and because I was in the band and then I was good enough to be brought into the senior band I had to miss classes on order to practice with the senior band because as you know music is about timing.  It's like athletics, it's all mathematics, it's timing and you've gotta be there with that timing, particularly if you're on the, in the rhythm section you needed to be there.  So, I had missed a few social studies classes.  But, every time I showed up for class there was a quiz.  Everybody knew whenever I showed up, after a while they knew whenever I showed up there was a quiz 'cause this guy had a bone about me missing his classes and coming in and what got me in trouble was that I probably was the smartest kid in the class.  If I didn't get the highest score on that test, I always got close to it.  He couldn't figure it out.  This kid is never here how can he pass my test?  Some, somehow he flunked me in both courses.  The English course and the social studies course, and my dad was furious.  He came in ready to fight.  He didn't come to talk he came ready to fight.  So, I stayed in that school for a year and a half and I left there and I went uptown to the school by the name of Stitt Junior High School [New York, New York], which was a predominately black school as well, but we also had a good mixture, we had a good mix there and--met a lot of people there.  Leslie Uggams used to kind of hang out and she lived across the street from the school so you know we knew her and I got to know--
Speaker 1: When you say she hung out there, what does that mean?
Speaker 2: She lived across the street from the school, and she was kind of protected.  Her parents would keep her from fraternizing with those kids too much across the street there.  Frankie Lymon was in school then, Frankie and Louie Lymon.  His brother was, was behind me, but I was one of the first group of Teenagers, Teen Chords.  Frankie was a Teenager.  Louie was a Teen Chords.  And I quit that group before, before they got into the recording mode.  I, I was being probed more by this jazz, this jazz thing and that still has a hold on me.  But we had, we had, we had a lot of fun.
Story_ID: 179093
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Had a lot of fun.
Speaker 2: So who, who, who were the people that you admired in jazz at that point?
Speaker 1: At that point?
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.
Speaker 1: In junior high school?
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.
Speaker 1: Art Blakey obviously because he was a drummer.  There was a fellow that, I never met him until years later, a fellow by the name of Mal Waldron who was a piano player.  I met him years, years, years later.  Didn't know that he was a guy who played with Billie Holiday.  I didn't, I had no concept.  He was Billie Holiday's musical director.  His nephew was one of my classmates at Howard in dental school [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.] and I met him years later and that shows you how small the world is.  We have all these connections with all of these experiences that we, that we have and he was one of my favorite people at the time.  One of my jazz drummer instructors was a fellow by the name of Ben Riley who lived across the street from me.  Ben Riley was playing with Thelonious Monk at the time and the other one lived downstairs from me a fellow by the name of Jimmy Cobb and Jimmy was playing with Miles.  So, I had these influences and I had these, these people I didn't really know how bit they were.  I just knew that they were in the business and they were helping me along.  The first time I heard Monk I said oh I don't like that.  It was different.  I don't like that, but I couldn't stop thinking about it.  It was something that just kept resonating in my brain and next time I went back to it, I said I'm gonna go back to this thing.  I went back to it and couldn't get, couldn't get away from them, not that I wanted to, still to this day.
Speaker 2: Well what happened the second time around?
Speaker 1: With Monk?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: I don't know.  I guess I heard something else from what I thought I heard the first time.  I heard something else and I started discriminating.  I started listening to with the same group, the same piece I started listening to individual musicians to see what each one was doing in each tune at that particular time, then you start, you listen to it again and then you start to put them all together and you see what everybody is doing and then you start to make sense out of it all.  And that's what got me into it all.  I used to be so good I could listen to a record and tell you whether it was East Coast or West Coast musicians.  I could tell you who was playing without looking at the album cover.  I can't do it today.  Some of them I can, but not for the most part I can't now.
Story_ID: 179094
Speaker 1: So, your music that you were being exposed to was it in, you know, just in the neighborhood or was it in, on the radio or through records?
Speaker 2: It, it was, it was sort of diverse.  When I started playing at school, I was playing school music and I was good enough to get put into the All-City Orchestra as well.  The All-City Orchestra here, I don't know if it exists in any other city, I think it does, that you get the best musicians pretty much from most of the schools and you come together as one central orchestra and they call it Al--City Orchestra and that was very exciting.  We were playing classical music, Shostakovich, Beethoven.  We were playing all these, all of these classical kinds of things and that was a totally different orientation.  You didn't hear that on the radio where we were and you didn't, certainly didn't hear it in my community.  In my community, you heard a lot of congas and bongos and you heard it all out in the street, which was, which was just really wonderful, wonderful music, you know.  All of it's coming in here and then you're listening to this other thing, you're playing this other thing.  The thing that used to kind of get me about classical music though in playing, in particular percussion side, you're very active for the first maybe six or seven measures and after that you got maybe 24 measures of rest over here and then after you cut the 24 right next to that you got another 32 measures of rest, so you're wondering well when do I hit (laughter).  There's always an inflection, bang, you know that's your time.  So, you play around with that.  So, I was playing school music.  I was playing classical music with All-City.  I joined the Drum and Bugle Corps right here in Harlem.  We had, we had a group called Minisink, the Minisink Warriors, which was a camp at, day camp in--(unclear)--.  You had people from all over the city that was a part of Minisink and that was, that was a real great situation.
Speaker 1: That was during the summers though wasn't it?
Speaker 2: The camp was during the summer, but we had continued the year around activities, and people would come back year around from all over the city almost on a weekly basis.  It was a socialization process.  It was the best way to get to know and meet people from all over the city rather than just in your little local community.  So, that worked out really very well.  So, playing school music, All-City, Drum and Bugle Corps, and then I had this jazz thing going in the background.  So, all of that, put it all together it gave me a fairly diverse arena of musical appreciation.
Story_ID: 179095
Speaker 1: Now, when you say that, you know, Jimmy Cobb was your, you know, did you say downstairs neighbor?
Speaker 2: He lived downstairs.  We lived on the second floor on 150th Street when we moved uptown.
Speaker 1: Okay and you said--
Speaker 2: He lived on the first floor; I lived on the second floor Jimmy Cobb--Ben lived across the street--Ben Riley.  In another building.
Speaker 1: So did you--how much exposure did you have with them?  You were saying at the beginning you didn't know necessarily who they, they were?
Speaker 2: In terms I didn't know how large they were in their chosen field.  I just knew that they were drummers and they were good, and they helped me.  I didn't know, you know, of course I found out after a while that Ben was playing with [Thelonius] Monk and I said JD now you don't just play with  Monk unless you know what you're doing and then you didn't play with Miles unless Miles liked what you were doing.  That's how you look at that.  A drummer's, a drummer's, a drummer, yeah but I can listen and I'm discriminating.
Story_ID: 179096
Speaker 1: So, what are you thinking you wanna do or do you wanna be a musician at that point?
Speaker 2: At that point?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah, at that point.  That was my only ambition.  I wanted to be a musician.
Speaker 1: And this is in your high school years or is this junior high?
Speaker 2: Junior high going into high school.  All through high school that's all I wanted to do, although I played sports in high school; I did all those things.
Speaker 1: Are you hanging out at clubs at all or are you not allowed?  You are?
Speaker 2: I was hanging outside the clubs.  You know, I, I, I, I always looked young.  I looked like a baby and I couldn't disguise that.  There's no way I could have gone in the clubs and, and looked like I belonged, not the way I looked, you know.  I'm sixty now; I don't look my age.  You know, but when I was younger I looked even less my age than I was supposed to.  So, yeah I hung out outside the clubs--Minton's [Playhouse].  We had a club over here on, Club Baron right over here that's no longer there.  Lickety Split up here on Seventh Avenue.  A lot of old venues that, that where you go and you hang out.  Things were different back then and you could, you could go into some clubs on Sunday, particularly where liquor was not being served on Sundays and play in these jam sessions because that's the way it was.  Unless you play in these jam sessions, you never knew who good you were or how good you could be, and that's how, that's how you grew.  Played every time you got a chance; that's what you wanted to do.
Speaker 1: And did you ever play bongos at all?  You did.
Speaker 2: I played every percussion instrument available.
Speaker 1: Every, okay, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Every percussion instrument available.  I even used to use drum sticks--I used to like to sit on a bench then that had a little hollowness on the, on the stand itself because I used to use that as one of my, one of my beats, one of my sounds.  You know you just hit the and the soul, you hit that as one of your sounds.  I used everything I could get.  Use the side of the drums.  I'd use the rimshots, I'd do everything.
Speaker 1: Steel drums?
Speaker 2: No, not tells drums.
Speaker 1: No, not steel drums.  See that's--
Speaker 2: Rimshots.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Every part of the drum was--you know you if you were a drummer you could expect to hit everywhere and that's what I would do because again I'm trying to get different sounds.  You have different instruments around you.  You have different tunes, bells, cowshells, cowbells, you name it.  Soda bottles sometimes with different levels of liquid in it and you hit.  Hold that and you hit that you get a different sound.  It was just very interesting.  It's about being creative, and that's what being a musician all about.  That's what being a jazz musician all about.  Most people turn their noses up about jazz, but you know I always like to say that there's a very thin line between being a jazz musician and being a genius, very thin line.  You know why?  Because you only talking about seven notes.  You talking seven notes.  Upper and lower case you're talking fourteen notes and how do you get all of that into these wonderful tunes that are being played in a synergistic manner that just kind of blends with everything else that's going on in the bandstand, genius.
Story_ID: 179097
Speaker 1: Let me ask you when did you feel, you know, I often ask musicians when they, you know, feel that they sort of found their, their own, their own sound or, I mean, you know got, where it became less, you know, just sort of a fling, but they got, they found themselves in the music is what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: That's a difficult question to answer because in order to get to a certain level of proficiency you're, you're gonna be listening to a lot of different musicians that are playing the same instrument that you're playing.  A lot of what you're doing while you're developing your own style is emulating what's already been done, but you get to a point where you get tired of emulating Joe Blow, Tommy, Bobby.  You get tired of emulating them and then you start to do some experimentation of your own.  In the process of playing, you start to experiment with different rhythmic patterns, different tones, different qualities, different inflections.  Some drummers just they bang it all out.  To me that's not, for my style, that was not music.  I wanted to be heard, but at the same time I didn't want to be overbearing.  That's one of the things I got from Ben [Riley].  I watched Ben.  I watch him, I watch him play and he does not move.  He does, he doesn't move, but I mean he's doing so much.  You listen to him, and he's doing so much and Sun Ra some people would say he's avant garde, he was out there, he was this, that, and the other, but if you've ever listened to Sun Ra, if you've ever gone to (you can't now because he deceased), but if you've ever gone to see a Sun Ra performance it was so exhilarating.  He was playing so much music and if you weren't listening you, you wouldn't, you wouldn't hear it, you weren't listening, you'd miss it.  He started at Saturday at 8 o'clock and wouldn't stop until 12 midnight.  It was continuous music and then it was dancing and there was visual aids and just absolutely incredible.  I started moving into a little avant garde, and during that period of time getting into the '60s [1960s] that's, that's what a lot of musicians were sort of experimenting with.  It actually--I'll tell you a funny story of avant garde.  When it started really catching on it was really more guys would get into rooms and they would start practicing and warming up and before you know it something clicked and people started doing different things and putting different pieces together.  Some of it was really very, very tasteful and some of it was a little hard on the ears, but this is what when you're asking me when do you know, you don't know.  You kind of feel your way through it.  You feel your way and then you feel into a setting.  You can play music, for instance, with the same quintet for maybe a year or maybe two years and after a while it's not doing anything for you and you move on and you start playing with other people and before you know it you're getting into a flow.  Why is it that Miles Davis' group for instance in the early '50s [1950s] they were nondescript pretty much, but then you got into the late '50s [1950s] and early '60s [1960s] and then they became groups that, I mean to be, to be reckoned with and every other group that was formed tried to emulate that group, that sound, and he took that with him for, I mean, he rode that out to the end.  To this day, people still (he's been dead how many years now at least ten years or more and they're still trying to find him.  They're still trying to find him. Coltrane they're still trying to find him.  Every saxophone player learning how to play today is still trying to play him.  Can't find their own sound.  Interestingly enough--Wayne Shorter is one of my favorite saxophonist that I listen to a lot and I remember listening to Wayne in the early days and Wayne was very disappointing to me because he was, he was John Coltrane all over again.  It's not that Coltrane was negative, it's just that you don't want two of them doing the same thing.  The beautiful sounds that Coltrane put out that you didn't want anybody else playing it.  But Wayne grew on that and in the early years he just was not someone you really wanted to listen to until he started coming into his own style, answering the questing that you were saying and now he's just really, not now, but I mean for the last several years he has been at his own sound and very distinctive sound.  No one else can play like him.  I don't care how often you try or how well intentioned you are you'll never be able to do it.  That's when you get your flow.  That's when you get your sound.  When does it happen? You don't know.  It just happens.
Story_ID: 179098
Speaker 1: Now, you were also you said playing sports, okay and, you know, what were you playing?
Speaker 2: I was a trackster and I was a football player.
Speaker 1: Did that start in junior high or high school?
Speaker 2: That started in high school.
Speaker 1: And where, where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: To George Washington High School [New York, New York] uptown.  I started running track in high school because it was this cute little girl named Mary Johnson [ph.] that I just really, really wanted to get to know a little better.  She was in my class, and I wanted her to get to look at me.  She wouldn't look at me.  I was chubby.  I was a big chubby kid, you know, so I ran track and lost all this weight, lost all this weight, and finally when she started looking I wasn't interested anymore.  It's a funny thing, but, I lost all this weight.
Speaker 1: So you--(unclear)--on the track team at the beginning with being overweight did you?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I did.  They put me on cross country.  And anybody could run cross country.  You know you run up in the hills.  You know I used to say facetiously we'll go out here and run across the field.  You run--we used up here at Van Cortlandt Park, run across the field, you go into the woods, you run up in the hills and you shake hands with the bears and you see the cheetahs over here and you just keep on running and you come back down.  But, that's cross country, and the training was good.  As a young teenager growing up you needed some form of exercise and it turns out that that was the perfect exercise for me.  So, I ran track during the track season, and I played football on football season.  I liked them both.  I was a rough kid.  I was always a rough kid.
Speaker 1: Were the teams that good at Booker, at George Washington?
Speaker 2: George Washington.  We didn't have a football team.  We had sandlot football teams.  We didn't have a football team because years before I got there some kid had lost his life playing football and the insurance from what we were told insurance provisions were just to exorbitant for them to continue to have it.  So, they kept that out.  So, we play--(unclear)--those of us who played.  The track team, we, we ran.  We were fairly decent.  We weren't the best track team in the city, bit when you look at the PSAL, Public School Athletic League, there was some awfully, awfully good tracksters and the PSAL from all over this city.  We had these track meets up at the armory on 168th Street and Broadway right across from Columbia Presbyterian Hospital every Saturday.  And the other reason you ran track is because that were all the little girls went.  They figured that's where all the guys are, so the girls were there and the guys felt, I mean it was a no-brainer, I'mma run track; that's where the women are.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: It was great--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: I, I know (laughter).
Speaker 2: Wonderful.
Speaker 1: That period of discovery there, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah--
Story_ID: 179099
Speaker 1: Now, what other things are forming you though as a young person?
Speaker 2: As a young person before going to high school and while I was in high school besides music, besides athletics, and besides young girls 'cause that what they were, I was awfully interested in fashion.  I used to model as a young, young runway model.  I used to model, and I liked that.  I did that for fun.  Never made a lot of money doing anything.  You know you did it all because you wanted to.  You did it all because you liked it.  This was another way of staying off the streets.  We didn't have a lot of people getting in trouble here growing up and all.  This was a beautiful place to grow up in because everybody was doing something.  Like if you were in high school you were either on a team or you were just a lot like being in college. At Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] everybody was doing something, you were a part of some group, some organization.  Maybe you were a thespian.  We had that element here.  Maybe you were an artist or a photographer or what have you.  You know we had that, that diversity here and it was really great and growing up in Harlem you had a lot of influences.  We had the NAACP Youth Group trying to get a foothold and, but you know as kids we were just to interested in doing other things to start getting involved in politics, and we didn't do that.  Some of us did.  After a while I got involved in it, after Chaney, Schwerner, and Goodman got killed in Mississippi.  One of the guys was a member of the youth group here at 125th Street, and I just met him briefly before he went down on that trip, and that, when, when they got killed and that's the thing that really flipped me into that arena.
Speaker 1: Now, in, in, what about subjects in school.  What were you interested in?
Speaker 2: I wasn't.  Wasn't interested in anything.  I, I had pretty much of a photographic memory then.  I could go to class, not take any notes, and sit down and listen to what was being said and I could remember.  I could remember.  I used to be pretty good, and I started getting older and I guess maybe the girls were on my mind, I don't know what it was, started forgetting some of the stuff I was hearing and I decided I needed to start writing some of this down.  I used to like math.  I used to like math, algebra.  I used to tutor some of my classmates and some of my friends in algebra.  And once I figured out to solve X plus Y equals zero, you know, once I started playing with those X and Ys and remembering the old quadratic equation, the 4AB I said you know I like this.  It was like a game.  I liked that and I liked science, but there wasn't a lot of it in the inner city schools.  Inner city schools they didn't want to lead you down that path.  They wanted you to do other things, which was not gonna push you into some sort of lasting career, career choice.  We weren't even pushed into college to be honest with you.
Story_ID: 179100
Speaker 1: Now what--how were you parents [Winifred Adams Riggs and Eric Riggs] sort of messaging at home?  You know what is the family messaging going on?
Speaker 2: They were, they were really great.  They were the kind of parents that allowed you to explore, to find out what it is you really wanted to do, anything within reason.  I mean, but they were always there to kind of guide you on the right side of the street more so than left side of the street.  I mean, they were agonizing that I was playing jazz (in the beginning I played jazz) because at the time you know we had an awful lot of jazz musicians who were Tyranids.  They were junkies and the feeling was that everybody who gets involved playing jazz is a junky or will be a junky, and so they were really agonizing about me going in that direction.  So, again it was something that, decision that I had to make, you know, to stay with or leave it.  But, they never go in the way of you making decisions.  You know my dad told me you don't want to ever get to a point in life where you haven't done something that you really want to do.  You don't want to kick yourself in the rump, as he used to say, for not doing the things that you wanna do.  How else are you gonna find out what you're good at if you don't explore these other avenues, and they were really good at that, you know.  So, what was I looking at?  I didn't know what I was looking at.  I was just trying to do different things to see which one grabbed me more than the next and whichever one that was that's the direction I was gonna go with.  But, I'm a Gemini; I'm a true Gemini.
Story_ID: 179101
Speaker 1: You know what I, what I was when I was asking about the messaging I was curious about your messaging from your family's standpoint of coming, either being a Panamanian American or Caribbean American versus, you know, traditional African Americans.  None of that.
Speaker 2: We didn't have those kinds of messages.  It was just pretty straight forward, you now, education and, and trade; that was it.
Speaker 1: So what, so education, trade, so what was trade?
Speaker 2: Trade was, it meant that being a plumber, being an electrician, being something within the trades that would provide a steady job.  Again, we're talking about in that period of time where you got a job and you stayed there until you spent thirty, thirty-five years.  Today, that doesn't happen.  You'll never be on any particular job for that long, but that's what happened back then.  But, there was never any, any discussions about Caribbeans versus African Americans, versus Africans, versus whites; we never had those kinds of conversations in my household.
Speaker 1: So what were, what were you encouraged to have as your trade?
Speaker 2: What was I encouraged?  My trade was gonna be music.
Speaker 1: We'll you, I--did your, did your parents think that that was a good trade to have?
Speaker 2: No, not at all, not at all but it was what I was good at, one of the things that I was really good at.
Speaker 1: Now, are there, are there other things influencing you?  I mean music is very central to your life you have this sports thing going on.  Is there anyone in the community that you're looking up to, any, anything related to church?  You know, we've already talked about the, the camp, you know, experience.  I'm just wondering if there were--
Speaker 2: Not, not particularly.  You know I was a Boy Scout and the usual, traditional Boy Scout stuff, went into the Order of the Arrow, which is--(unclear)--honorary society.  And the reason I went into the Order of the Arrow [OA] is because they had this, this ceremony that you know you're sitting all around in a circle and when you were eligible for induction in Order of the Arrow the whole thing is Indian, you know--you gonna wear this badge, a sash with an arrow and that sort of thing and the guys who were already order they dressed up like Indians and they'd walk around and they tap you out, you know you're kind of identified.  You're not supposed to know that you're in, but they kind of walk around and they tap you out, you know, just kind of boom hit you on the chest and guys behind you grab you and they run you off, you know, somewhere and they put you through this little ceremony and then they give you your little sash and now your OA, you know, and I just liked that.  You know, I always used to say that I liked the primitiveness about, you know, that whole ceremonial thing.  I always used to say that and I lived back in the day when there were cowboys and Indians I definitely knew I wanted to be an Indian.  I definitely knew that because they were in my opinion, from my perspective they got killed, they got massacred and all that, but you really didn't mess with that.  I mean it struck so much fear in folks, and they were able to live off the land without any frills.  There's something about that primitiveness that I've always liked.
Story_ID: 179102
Speaker 1: Well Dr. Riggs what--how did the decision come about with Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio]?  I mean that's why I'm trying, I'm trying to figure out there's nothing--how does that figure out?
Speaker 2: I got out of high school in '61 [1961].
Speaker 1: Okay that's right you went into the service, okay.
Speaker 2: --(Simultaneous)--and I'm playing music.
Speaker 1: Okay, you're playing music.
Speaker 2: I'm playing music.  There was a woman in my church--we had local draft boards--there was a woman in my church that used to be the director of that local board that I happen to be in.  She happen to catch me one day after I got off, I was an acolyte, you know, we all were.  Got off the altar one day she called me and she says come here what are you doing, tell me what you're doing, how old are you--(unclear)--.  She was one of these women, you know, Hillary Clinton stole one of our phrases about taking a village to grow a child, but I'll tell you that's what it was like growing up in Harlem and this woman grabbed me after church one day and I told her I said well I'm just playing music and this and that.  She said well you know what when is your birthday, and I told her.  She says well I work for Draft Board 16 and I didn't know that.  I looked in my wallet and I saw my draft card and my draft card there was her name big as, she signed it, never paid any attention to it.  She says well right now we're drafting 1941 and we're drafting three months per month and we're right now at March and she said you go home and do your homework and we'll talk next week.  So, I thought about it three months per month and they were at March in 1941, so I started figuring out when I would get drafted if I were to be drafted and the time came up that you would be drafted in 1965.  So, that said to me then that means in 1964 I've got to do something.  So, I started in 1963, was going to school part-time up here at Columbia [University, New York, New York].  Hated every day, every minute I had to be up there because being in college at that time and being actively involved in the music scene at that time was so incompatible.  There was no way that those could work, but I just needed an excuse and in answering your question in class one day somebody called me that name that we use in our community and not outside our community and I knew I had to get away from here because I'm gonna go to jail if I do something, so, I left there.  After high school, I had several scholarship offers and I never followed through one.  I had tried to get back on the scholarship route and JC Smith offered me a track scholarship coming from the North, you know, Charlotte--I didn't know where Charlotte, North Carolina, was.  To me that was too far south.  I didn't want to go there.  I didn't know where I was, so I didn't bother with that one.  I had a track scholarship to Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland], which at the time Morgan State had one of the best track teams in this country.  If you were a betting person, you could win place a show with them, no problem.  We're always gonna make money with those guys.  And I was honored to think that the track coach felt that I could add to their program.  I was really honored.  In fact, I was really humbled.  I went down for the interview and a try-out and they wanted me there and I wanted to be there, but I wanted to play football too.  They didn't want me to do both.  You could only do one.
Story_ID: 179103
Speaker 1: Then, I went out to Miami of Ohio [Miami University, Oxford, Ohio].  Miami University in Ohio offered me a full scholarship to play football.  Access to a car, access to money, access to an apartment.  NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] regulations did not allow that to happen other than coming this route they wanted to fly my parents [Winifred Adams Riggs and Eric Riggs] out for home games, and this was perfect except they wanted me to consider majoring in something within their department, which was physical education, and I didn't really know what that was.  So, I called my sister who was at NYU [New York University, New York, New York] at the time and I asked--(unclear)--what is physical education.  She said ugh, you gonna be a gym teacher?  I said I don't want to be no damn gym teacher.  So, I told them I would have to discuss it with my parents and let them know.  I didn't have to discuss anything with my parents.  My parents were so happy they were trying to get me out of these nightclubs and playing jazz.  They couldn't care where, care less where I went.  But, it was just purely my decision.  But, at the airport we shared the same airport, that's interesting.  University of Dayton [Dayton, Ohio], Miami of Ohio, Wittenberg [Springfield, Ohio], Cedarville [University, Cedarville, Ohio], a lot of colleges used that airport in Dayton [Ohio].  I just took a chance and called my buddy who I used to tutor in algebra when we were in junior high school.  He was at Central [State University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  He just happen to walk in the dorm just when I called him.  He wanted, he was surprised.  He wandered what I was doing out here, so I told him I came out here for an interview.  He said why don't you come over here for a day, I'll take you and introduce you to the track coach, football coach over here.  I said, Well how would I get there?  He said what do you have to do tomorrow?  I said nothing I had to just go home and practice my music.  So, he came to get me.  We went out to school, took about forty-five minutes then.  Beautiful campus and small campus, 2500 students, and you parked your car in the back and you know any, anybody who is knew on the campus, you know, you'll know who they are and the first three people that came up to Jean [ph.] were these three gorgeous women, African American woman, gorgeous.  They each kissed him on the cheek wanting to know who his friend was, mwah, and I knew right then this is where I'm going to school.  This is where I'm going to school.  Whether I get any help to play ball or run track or whatever, this is where I'm going to school.  So, the rest is history.  That's where I went to school and, and I've never looked back.
Story_ID: 179104
Speaker 1: So did you know much about the history of Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] when you went?
Speaker 2: I knew absolutely nothing about the history of Central State.  It was one of the best four years that I have ever spent in my entire life.
Speaker 1: And you started in 1964 there?
Speaker 2: Sixty-four.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And in 1964 in June, I left in July, at a point of July and then came back home and repacked for football.  There was a little mini riot, they call it a riot right here on 106, 125th Street right on Lenox Avenue and so I went to Central, then and coming from New York, coming from the North you know you're not taught certain things.  We had a course that had to be taken; it was a mandatory course.  It was called History of the Negro Before 1865; that was for a semester, History of the Negro After 1865, which was the second semester.  I didn't know where 1865 came from or the, or the significance of it.  I thought they just pulled these numbers out of their hair, but I learned in that first course, in that first semester, we had history instructors down there, two of them, that you probably might have interviewed who are still alive today and they're members of the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity] out in Ohio.  Paul McStallworth and Harry Johns [ph.] who was our business manager then.  Mark Robinson [ph.] we used to call, Mark Robinson--the history department J. T. Henry they were just excellent.  What she said--(unclear)--she says okay we're gonna talk about this topic today.  What have you learned about this?  And we're gonna talk about the things that we were, that were taught, things we learned.  She says okay let's talk about it.  We went ahead and we talked about these things.  She said okay now let's talk about the things you didn't learn, and they started talking about us from Africa when the slaves, the Africans were put on these slaves ships and brought in on trans, on transatlantic shuffle there.  It opened up a world that I never knew existed, and I think that experience and that particular course for the most part is really what put me on the map, that put me on the map to learn all there was to be learned about us, these people, you people.  It made my whole life fuller.
Speaker 1: Now was there--there was a lot--because Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] and Central State shared a history, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: One came--well Central State came out of Wilberforce, so they were, I think, one in the same at one point.
Speaker 2: Wilberforce University was started in 1847.  It's a church-supported school by the AME Zion Church.  The industrial arts division of Wilberforce University, which is ultimately what became Central State University, Central State College and now Central State University had a split in 1947.  The State of Ohio came to Charl, Dr. Wesley, Charles was president of Wilberforce at that time.  They approached him about starting a separate college, which would be a public college because Wilberforce University was a private college, and he would be the next, he would be the first president of Central State College.  So, Central State College was really a small entity that, that arose out of the industrial arts division of Wilberforce University.  We shared the same land space and land area.  The state then came in and built a separate college, and although they're two separate colleges they, they could look like one.  They were really so close to each other.  Nineteen forty-eight was our very first graduating class from Central State College, which offered a different liberal arts degree than Wilberforce University did.  That was a good class.  Leontyne Price was a member of that class.  Alma Rangel, the congressman's [HM the Honorable Charles Rangel] wife, lives right upstairs here, was also a member of that class, so was Tom--(unclear)--was the associate dean for the College of Dentistry at Howard.  He was a member of my class and a number of other--Eddie Irons [ph.] who was the first ever African American in this country to get a PhD in economics, was a former member of the, out of Florida, he's the former member of the Central Bank.  It gave us a history.  It, it just really blossomed out into the institution that it's become.
Speaker 1: Now when you arrived it was really Central State College--
Speaker 2: College.
Speaker 1: --and became university the next year.
Speaker 2: And it became university, actually no it became university in '66' [1966].
Speaker 1: '66' [1966] okay, I heard it was '65 [1965] okay.
Speaker 2: --(Simultaneous)--'64 [1964], '65 [1965], '66 [1966] they were talking about when they wanted to flip it over from college to university.  Of course, there are certain things that had to be in place in order for it to be a university.  We developed the graduate school in order to give it the university moniker, graduate school in education.  We've lost that school since that time, but it's still Central State University, great place.
Story_ID: 179105
Speaker 1: So, did you hang a lot at--
Speaker 2: Great place.
Speaker 1: --at Beacom gymna, gym [Beacom/Lewis Gym, Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: I did.  You know about Beacom Gym?  Yeah, well I, I spent quite a bit of time in Beacon Gym because as a football player we had all our practices, our indoor practices and scout session in Beacon Gymnasium and the various rooms there and as a trackster, you know, we had to be in and out of there all the time, so it's--my name is around there somewhere, somewhere.
Speaker 1: So what was--do, do--what are you thinking you wanna major in at that point?  You're not--
Speaker 2: I was, I was a psych major.
Speaker 1: But had you declared that when you came in cause that, that had nothing to do--
Speaker 2: I, I, I think I did.  I think--
Speaker 1: You did, well where did that come from because that wasn't in anything you--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: It seemed to be a natural progression, and it seem to, to really fit well with my, my personality, so and that's the reason I chose that direction.
Speaker 1: Were you thinking you wanted, I mean, you wanted to be either a social worker or psychologist?  Were you--
Speaker 2: I didn't know what I wanted to be.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I declared when I first got there that I was gonna be a psych major.  It sounded good too, you know, coming home as a psych major.  You know how you come down the, the streets here.  You go to--(unclear)--what do you mean?  Oh I'm majoring in psychology, you know, caught up in all that nonsense there for a while.  We're not having a real purpose and they were a lot of us who didn't have a real purpose other than going to school and trying to get out with a degree.  Perhaps somewhere down the road, you know, you're gonna develop an interest in something that will be productive, but you just didn't know unless you had a lot of people in the family that did that.  I'm first generation to college, so we didn't have a lot of direction in terms of which direction to go in, but you pick things up as you go along.
Story_ID: 179106
Speaker 1: Now Dr. [Harry] Groves was president, right, wasn't or was it, was that the president at the--
Speaker 2: Dr. [Charles] Wesley--
Speaker 1: Wes, oh he--
Speaker 2: --was there when I went there.
Speaker 1: And then--
Speaker 2: And then Dr. Groves came and Dr. Jackson, Lewis Jackson was the interim president and then Dr. Groves came in.  Dr. Groves came in and was president for a while and he had a tough time.  He had a rocky experience there.
Speaker 1: And why was that?  Was it because it was--where had he come from?
Speaker 2: I believe he, his experiences were dissimilar to ours.  I believe he had his undergraduate training in Colorado or somewhere in that area, and of course his master's and Ph.D. where I'm not sure.  I do not recall where it was from, but he was a lawyer, in fact.  He was a lawyer.  Very, very bright man, very bright man, good presence and these are the things you looked at.  You know you see these things and back then you, you look at your college president and you see him wearing shirts and ties every day and you say, you know, clean cut, that's the kind of person I wanna be like.  Dr. Wesley, I mean, you couldn't be any, couldn't get any higher than Dr. Wesley.  This is the man I wanna be like.  I wanna talk like him.  I wanna walk like him.  I wanna do everything like him.  He, he had just such a reservoir--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: Now do you--can you--did you know much about Dr. Wesley's background?
Speaker 2: A bit, a bit.  Not, not before I got there no.
Speaker 1: Right, no, okay.
Speaker 2: No after, after I got there I went to the library did some poking around.  I did find out certain things then.  And, and I'm an Alpha.  I placed Alpha--(unclear)--in our history books and he called in all of his football players and basketball players and tracksters who were Alphas to his office and he wanted to make sure that we understood that you're not here to run and play ball and to shoot ball or catch a ball, you're here to study.  You're here to be a scholar.  That's what I want you to be.  Keep that in your mind.  And so we really got to, to know him.  He really did work with the young Alpha brothers, and that's when I first found out about, about the Boule because on his book shelf he had the history book that we all knew.  It is written by Wesley, black book with good and it says history about Phi Alpha, Wesley.  Right next to it history of Sigma Pi Phi, Wesley, and I was confused.  I said I didn't know we could belong to two Greek-letter Organizations and all that was said to us, to me specifically, because I asked the question was that that's just another honorary organization that I belong to.  That's all that was said, and you never heard about it again ever.
Speaker 1: Well that was a time when Boule was really secretive.  I mean, not that it's, it's coming out a little bit more.  Now--
Speaker 2: People like that you are trying to figure it out.
Speaker 1: Right, I'm trying to bring it out, trying to get them to adopt us.  I (laughter), it's like I can touch it but--
Story_ID: 179107
Speaker 1: Is there social unrest going on in the campus [at Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] during those years?  When, when is the Central State--now that's was it Central State that kids--, no I'm thinking of Kent State [University, Kent, Ohio], but is there any social unrest or is it pretty conservative?
Speaker 2: No, it's very conservative.  It's very noncommittal as were all of the black colleges at that time, but there's always one event that will change the nature of the direction of the total student body, and in this case it's Central State.  It was precipitated by an occurrence that, that had the Ohio State Troopers coming up to our campus in 1967, November 1967.  They must have had at least 100 cars that were bumper-to-bumper coming on our campus, and we couldn't figure out what was going on.  We didn't know what was going on, but the unrest was coming from without, it was starting to brew in different parts of the country.  Kent State that happened and so since we had this little black college here with these, with these people that were not considered people we had to control these people before they get out of line, and at the same time Malcolm [X] was, was speaking about a lot of things and people began to listen and they didn't want that, you can't have that in this country, you can't have it on this campus.  So, it began and the, the whole wave of, of, of getting in tune with our history, our historical roots began to, to take hold and you may know that in every black college during that period of time if one group of students grabs the president and smacks the president then it's gonna be replicated in every other black college within three or four days because we all knew someone in other colleges and before you know it the phone calls came in and said you know what we did today; those things happened.  That was the beginning really, I believe, of the wave of what happened in the '60s [1960s] and then after [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] was killed in '68 [1968] that really made it worse.
Speaker 1: 'Cause that you were saying, yeah when he was, he was killed in this--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, in, in the spring of--
Speaker 2: April 4th.
Speaker 1: Right,
Speaker 2: That's right and the significance of that date for us was April 4th was the Alpha Phi Alpha [Fraternity] inauguration day.  Martin Luther King was an Alpha.  He was killed that day.  All across this nation things were happening.  We had the writers going all over the place.  That's one of the reasons I don't go to Mississippi to this day 'cause we almost lost our lives there.  It's, it was a tough time.  It was a real tough time.  We saw a number of people who were so conservative and so noncommittal just sort flip over.  They never knew before.  They never understood before and they never had these experiences before.  They never heard these things before.  Sure, we learned about history of the Negro before 1865 and then after 1865, but we didn't hear all the other things that were coming out.  We didn't listen to what James Baldwin what he was saying.  We didn't look at what [HM] Nikki Giovanni was talking about.  We didn't hear what Malcolm was saying.  We started listening until we heard it.  So, it was a tough time.  It really was a time of learning and a time of with all that happened and with all that occurred during that period of time I would say that I know for the majority of the people that were there when I was there most of us academically began to do very, very well because we started applying that to what we were being taught in school.  We started trying to make the connections.  We started trying to connect those dots, and it made us start thinking more.  It made us start really understanding what earning what and what education was and the things that we were fighting for back then.  The hoped for result is not what we got today.  It's different.
Speaker 1: What are the hoped for results?
Speaker 2: Level playing field, that's all it was, level playing field.  Open up the doors, that's all it ever was.
Story_ID: 179108
Speaker 1: Now, so it's time for you to graduate [from Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] and so what are thinking you're gonna do?
Speaker 2: Well, I was fortunate that I knew that, I knew that I was gonna do because I'd gotten picked up by the Green Bay Packer farm team.  I knew what I was gonna do.  I also--this was in April, the April draft--and I also got drafted in the Army in June.  I got drafted twice within a couple of months, so I knew what I was gonna do.  But, prior to that and prior to knowing where I was gonna be going, I didn't have a clue.  I just knew that I was going back home, and I knew that I was gonna be looking for a job that was gonna pay me at least 100 bucks a week, 5,200 dollars a year.  That was great money back then.  That was my goal.
Speaker 1: Now were--had you during Central State years were you playing music--(unclear)--or--
Speaker 2: Just sporadically.
Speaker 1: Sporadically okay.
Speaker 2: Sporadically.  In fact one of my classmates, one of my classmates kept it going and that's the way that he makes his living today, Joe Ford, played with [HM] McCoy Tyner for a number of years and really good, heck of a musician.  We've had a very strong musical tradition at Central State starting with Leontyne Price, but on the jazz side, Frank Foster is the one who used to teach English there.  I don't know if you're into jazz, if you know these people, Cecil McBee bass player, you know, comes out of there.  Nancy Wilson comes out of there.  Joe Ford comes out of there.  George Russell comes out of there.  I mean, we can go on and on and on.  Leo Corby who was, used to be acting president of some of the colleges here in, in the, in the city, bass player.  Every year we go back for home coming we used to have a jazz concert.  Every year all of the collegiates would come back to play.  Tony Williams, a guy out of Philadelphia, a master saxophonist, alto sax, Tommy Grice, tenor saxophone player.  GiGi Grice was his brother, played a lot with Horace Silver in the early years.  I can go on and on and on.  And these guys come back.  We all come back.  We all play.  And I hadn't played in about twenty years one, one, one year and for twenty years, had a twenty-year lapse and the guys said you know the only problem is that you don't want it to be twenty-one years.  So, they gave me these drum sticks and I sat behind the drums, we had a big band thing, and it just felt like riding a bike.
Story_ID: 179109
Speaker 1: Nick Burghelea is the videographer.  We have two observers today, Paul Brock and Larry Crowe.  This is a pick-up interview from 2003.  I will have Dr. Riggs restate his name, spell it out for me, and give me today's date and we will proceed.
Speaker 2: You need me to spell it out too huh?
Speaker 1: Please.
Speaker 2: All right, my name is Dr. Enrique Riggs, that's E-N-R-I-Q-U-E.  Today is Tuesday the 7th of June 2005.
Speaker 1: This is a pick-up interview that started in 2003 with Julieanna Richardson, and I [Shawn Wilson] am picking it up today.
Story_ID: 179110
Speaker 1: We will start, 1968 you were drafted by Green Bay Packers.
Speaker 2: In 1968, it was a very, very good year for me.  I was getting ready to get out of college, and I was, there was nothing that I was looking forward to just getting out of college.  It was one of the hallmarks of, of my life.  I was drafted in April by the Green Bay Packer organization and I turned around and graduated in June, but I was drafted in June also by the U.S. Army.  So, I think I might have been one of the few people in this country that can, can say that I was drafted twice in one year.  It was an interesting turn of events in my life, and during that period of time it was very stressful as well because this was towards the, the--I can't say the end of the War in Vietnam, certainly things were, were winding down, the largest offensive I think that, that we experienced during that period of time was in '66 [1966], '67 [1967] with the Tet Offensive.  I think that was the biggest push then, and just about every male in this country between a certain age was drafted or conscripted and was a part of the military and sent to places of great entry as we now know.  There were some other, other students from other colleges and not even collegiate students, but also young men who opted to go to other countries to escape the draft.  Some went to Canada, some went to the Caribbean, some went to Cuba.  Of course our relationship, the American relationship with Cuba wasn't as contentious at that period of time, so there were a number of people who went in different directions.  Some people went to Europe.  Obviously, we were limited, you know.  If we went anywhere, we could only go to the Caribbean or go to Africa and that's just the way things were.  But the reality was in the '60s [1960s] was that we didn't go anywhere.  We had nowhere to go, so we all went into the military, whether we wanted to or not and the majority of those people were sent to Vietnam.  We even had a situation where I, I remember being in, in the military with a guy who was in, in prison actually for drug trafficking.  He, himself, was an addict, but he was given an option by the government at that point if you had nothing to lose being in prison you could be released provided you agreed to be on the front line, and a lot of that happened, so, it was an opportunity.  If you had for instance someone who had a life sentence in prison, what did he have to lose?  Do I stay in jail and be dehumanized for the rest of my life, I know that there is no end to this thing or do I take a chance on agreeing to go on the front line there's a possibility I might survive, and a lot of them did, some of them did.  So, that was an--(unclear)--; it was a way.  So, 1968 for me was, was a very, very interesting and at the same time it was also a very stressful period because you never really knew which direction you were gonna go in.  So, in that regard the NFL [National Football League] was a, was a, was a welcomed addition, and it was also something that I didn't look forward to doing.  It wasn't something that I was chasing, so it worked out, worked out well.
Story_ID: 179111
Speaker 1: How did the NFL [National Football Association] come about for you?
Speaker 2: Well, I was a, I was a receiver, those names change, and I tell you I, I was called a split end.  So, now by telling you that you know what my age is, not that I'm hiding from it, but I was, I was a split end and I believe that I was recruited in my sophomore year.  The scouts were down to watch a game that we played with Tennessee State University, and they were scouting two players, a quarterback by the name of Jim Gilliam--I'm sorry, a quarterback by the name of Eldrige Dickey and they were scouting a cornerback by the name of Marsalis, Jim Marsalis, and I believe that that's when they saw me.  Marsalis, wherever I moved he moved and vice versa, and I had never played a game such as this where both players had a good day, unusual.  So, I believe that's when the ball began to roll, unknown to me.  You know when your coaches are starting to change the way that you play there must be a reason for it.  I didn't know what it was.  The game was not fun anymore, so I believe that's when it got started to answer your question.
Speaker 1: And you were drafted?
Speaker 2: I was drafted.
Speaker 1: And how long did you play for the [Green Bay] Packers?
Speaker 2: I stayed with the Packers about three months, three or four months, and I was traded to New York.  I was on a farm team, traded to New York.  How long did I play?  Two years longer than I wanted to.  There was a two-year period, but interesting in its own right.  I always tried to extract the best of out every situation, and I added to my resume of life, so to speak.
Speaker 1: So, will you briefly explain to me what the farm teams were?
Speaker 2: Farm teams basically were teams that were set up for, for the team to have a pool of players in the event that practice, prac, practice, has a practice team for one thing, but in the event that a player does get hurt you need a replacement him and you need him right away.  You can't go looking around for that person, so the farm team was set up to, to play along with and practice along with the main team.  You know the plays, you have the same play books.  You go through a series of everything that's involved in, in being on that team.  There is no guarantee that you'll be pulled to play, but that's, that's what that farm system is all about.
Story_ID: 179112
Speaker 1: We wanna actually just talk some about other black players on the Green Bay [Packers] team at that time.
Speaker 2: Oh, gee we had Willie Wood who was there.  You have to help me out with some of these names 'cause some of them I've forgotten.
Speaker 1: Larry Crowe:  Herb Adderley
Speaker 2: Willie Wood.  Herb, Herb Adderley was there.
Speaker 1: Larry Crowe:  Willie Davis.
Speaker 2: Willie Davis.  Willie Davis went on to have a very successful career in business after he left the Packers, in fact in California and L.A. [Los Angeles, California], but I believe he's still out there doing some of what he was doing.
Speaker 1: So, there weren't any black players on the offensive line at Green Bay?  Did you have any--
Speaker 2: On the team, now pretty much everyone was, was on the defense, but we did have offensive players as well.  I think back--now you're asking me to go back in time, not that I can recall that the, the Packer team was pretty much, pretty much of a lily-white situation, as, as most of the teams were at that period of time.  You wouldn't know this because you're, you're a little too young, to, to know what the setup was, predominantly the, the African American players in the league at that time all came out of HBCUs because we were not, we were not in numbers, large numbers in majority institutions.  That didn't occur, that situation didn't start changing until April 4th of 1968 after [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated and there were a lot of changes that occurred at that point.  I can recall a story of a former coach, [Paul William] Bear Bryant, from Alabama that basically Bear Bryant was the, was the model for other coaches throughout the country as far as collegiate coaches are concerned.  As Bear Bryant moved, everyone else moved where he did and I think that this happened to have changed sometime back when his team, Alabama, University of Alabama, played a bowl game against a team I think that had one or two, two black players they just demolished him on the other side.  The player that actually demolished him and, and had him change his, his focus on how he should run his team was Bam Bam Cunningham.  Have you heard that name before?
Speaker 1: I have.
Speaker 2: Okay, his brother was a quarterback in the, in the NFL for--
Speaker 1: Larry Crowe:  Randall.
Speaker 2: Randall Cunningham for a number of years.  It was that one player really that changed the direction of how these coaches were gonna start addressing the issue of black players.  Now, we had certain states in this country that had some very strong football teams, HBCU [historically black colleges and universities] teams.  We had Maryland, Eddie Banks at Morgan State.  You had Florida A&M and Gaither down there.  Tennessee at, Tennessee State, Coach Killian.  You had Louisiana.  You had Ed Robinson down there, and some of these players who lived in those states when they started getting ready to go to college on scholarships they could not get out of that state unless you spoke to these coaches first and that's why they had such strong powerhouse teams.  With the SWAG conference in particular was very strong.  SWAG was very, very strong.  We had the CIAA on this, on this, on this which was a very, very formidable conference and Florida A&M, I mean, its, its, they're world renown for all the kinds of players that they had.  In the 1967 draft, 1967 draft Morgan State had one of the strongest teams in the country.  Rather they were black, white, blue, stripped, or polka dot it didn't matter.  They had one of the strongest teams.  They sent over 11 ball players to the NFL in Canada, and I'm talking George Knott, Frenchy Fuqua, Elvin Bethea, Ray Chester, Willie Lanier, you know, on and on and on.  These are the guys who made that team, who made that conference and they went on subsequently to make the NFL and the AFL because they had not merged at that point.  That was a very, very strong statement.  Today, I'm shickering when I look at the NFL draft every year.  I look at that draft every year and I go down the names, I go down the roster and I look at the schools and where these players coming from.  This year in 2005 happens to be the first year in a series of years, in the last five or ten years, where we had more black players coming out of HBCUs than we have had in a, in a very, very long time.  This is the first year.  Hopefully, it's a trend.
Story_ID: 179113
Speaker 1: So in '68 [1968] also you were drafted into the [U.S.] Army, what was that experience like?
Speaker 2: Very interesting.  I was drafted into the Army and some deals were worked out in order for me to not be sent to the active Army at that time because there was a need for me to be elsewhere.  So, I was put into the reserve program at least until my career was over and then at that point then I'd go, gone and put in my active duty time, which is what happened.  So that was very interesting.  When I went away to basic training as a reservist, there was always this contention between the active duty and the reservists.  It was always that contention.  There was also another contention of being from the North, being a Yankee as I was called, one of the names that I was called.  You wouldn't know this, but the, the drill sergeants for the most part in, in the Army--probably [U.S.] Marines as well, but particularly in the Army (I can't speak for the Marines because I wasn't there) were mainly southerners who had a pa, particular point of view which was not consistent with my point of view actually.  So, we had a great deal of contention there.  The fact that I was already assigned to, to an NFL [National Football League] team that made a little difference, but it didn't make much of a difference.  It made a little difference, but in my mind, from my perspective, I knew I was gonna, only gonna be there a very short period of time, so I could put up with what went down.
Speaker 1: So, what would you say the Southerners' attitude towards--the drill sergeants attitude were toward, towards the northern blacks?
Speaker 2: Well you gotta, you have to, you have to understand that the Civil War is still being fought today in 2005.  I think it sums it up.  That's the way it is.
Speaker 1: So, you were in the reserves from '68 [1968] or until--
Speaker 2: Well a combination reserve from '68 [1968] until I just retired in September of 2004.
Story_ID: 179114
Speaker 1: So, what happened at the end of '68 [1968]?  You, you went into the reserves, you did your time in the reserves, what follows, what comes next for you?
Speaker 2: Well, you mean now what--
Speaker 1: I mean in 19--
Speaker 2: In '68 [1968]?
Speaker 1: I'm on '68 [1968] so--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, it was a process, it was a process.  You know '68 [1968] was getting into the reserve program, it was a sort of protection for me.  The league looked at it differently.  We need to protect you, so we're gonna get you involved in that.  So, I was in the reserve program until my playing career was over with and then I had to go on and do my active duty time.  So, I did my two and a half years and then came back out, got away from it for a while, and went back in the reserve program.
Speaker 1: So in 1971--
Speaker 2: Nineteen-seventy one.
Speaker 1: --you went to the State University of New York at Albany [Albany, New York]?
Speaker 2: Right.  1971 I finished my master's degree from the State University of New York at Albany.  My off-season job was as a counselor for what we called the EOP program, Educational Opportunities Program, which is a program that started in the late '60s [1960s] in the state system, State of New York to bring minority kids to colleges who had not been admissible at those colleges since their inception and the program was a program that was statewide.  It was designed to provide opportunity for kids who ordinarily would not have been given that opportunity.  The problem with those programs at that time was that in the very format in how the programs were structured you could not admit a kid into that program if his average was about 70 coming out of high school.  It had to be someone who had a below 70 average or below C average.  The thinking--I can go into some, some other things--but the thinking, I think, at the time was that these are the kids who need the help the most.  You don't wanna go after those kids who are a 75, C plus or B, B students because according to what we were told other colleges want them.  That really wasn't the reality, but that was the rationale.  So, if you take a pool of students who are below C average and you put them into an environment where the median average is let's say 88, the likelihood that you're gonna rise from being a below C student to a B student is very unlikely because you're not use to the type of competition and you're not use to the type of dedication that you're gonna have to, to, to instill in order for you to rise to that level so, it's balance.  My own personal feeling as I said the Civil War is still being fought.  That's just an opinion.
Story_ID: 179115
Speaker 1: So did you take anything from your experiences with Dr. [Kenneth] Clark and the dolls [Clark Doll Test]?  Were, were there any similarities between this program you were working in 1971 versus what you'd experienced as a teenager with the dolls?
Speaker 2: Actually now you're talking about two different, two different situations.  The experience with the dolls when I, I worked with Northside Center in the early '60s [1960s] that was my summer jobs when I would come home from school for the summers and I was doing a lot of the testing for what we called the in-house name for, for the, the test was the show me test.  And that was designed to, to show and to, to research to show the effects of color on children and how this would ultimately push them, in what direction it would push them in life as it related to how they, they, they believed what they believed, who they believed, and who they really basically thought they were.  That was one phase of the educational component that I'd been involved in.  We were talking about children who may have been four or five or six years old at that point.  Now in 1971 were talking about young adults, seventeen, eighteen and up who had other experiences, and I wouldn't connect the two based on the question that you asked me in that regard because there were so many other gaps that, let's just say got that kid from age six to age eighteen.  So, we're looking at some totally different situations.
Story_ID: 179116
Speaker 1: So, in 1971 when you were working in the program, what other things were happening in your life?
Speaker 2: In my life?
Speaker 1: In your life at the time?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was very, I was looking around.  I kept looking.  I'm always looking for other things.  I'm a true Gemini.  People say well what does that mean?  Well, Geminis are supposed to be twins.  We're supposed to be, we're supposed to have two personalities, but Geminis are people who have many, many interests.  We don't master any of it, but we have many interests.  We're good at all of it, but we're not great at any of it, and if we only took the time to say I'm just gonna do one thing in life we'd be better than great at it.  But, we have so many interests because we have a capacity that's probably more insatiable than most.  So, what was I doing in 1971?  I was trying to get away from playing football, which was easy 'cause I didn't have to make that decision.  I was trying to decide where I was gonna be in the next five years.  I've carved out five year incremental patterns for my life.  Every five years I had a different goal and I'd try to meet that goal and that's what I was doing in '71' [1971] trying to figure out what my next move was going to be.  Now, what did I do in order to get there?  Well, as a counselor to minority kids at a major university they need support.  They needed support.  A lot of them were at that point where they had to start taking entrance exams for graduate school, professional schools, and any other kind of school they wanted to go to.  Well, I had to go in there and take the test with them because I had to show them, well look I'm gonna take the test you might as well come take it.  If I didn't go, they wouldn't have taken it, and I just took the test.  Nothing, I didn't have any, any direction, I just took the test; I took them all.  Surprisingly, I did well on those tests.  I didn't try to do well.  I didn't try to pass 'em; I just took 'em.  Those days that I took those tests I'm not that smart.  I just happen to guess well those days.  I did well on those tests, so I had options presented to me when it was time for me to make decisions.  Do I go to medical school, do I go to dental school, do I go to law school, do I go to business school, do I go to grad school?  Obviously, I went to grad school, but I also took another shot at going to dental school.  And the reason I did that was because as a physician I didn't want to be around blood.  I didn't want to be around people who were always in pain and you're not being able to really do anything to resolve those conflicts.  I really wanted to go to law school and major in taxation and finance and get a combined MBA; that's what I wanted to do, but remember the time 1970, 1971.  Where would I go with a MBA?  Taxation and finance, so as lawyer with taxation and finance looking like I lived in the sun where would I go?  Who would hire me?  And those were the kinds of things that made me decide on the direction that I was gonna go in life.  I went to dental school and enjoyed it.  I enjoy it thoroughly today, and I'm glad that I went in that direction, but I've moved on as well.
Story_ID: 179117
Speaker 1: So, did you have mentors during the '70s [1970s]?  Who mentored you, who--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --did you look up to, who were some of the people that helped you along--
Speaker 2: I sure did, I sure did, my father [Eric Riggs].  My father was a laborer, born in Panama.  My family was born in Panama.  We'd come out of Barbados and Jamaica.  But in the early 1900s the only work in the region was in building the Panama Canal, so you would find that in Panama you had people who came from every part of the Caribbean because that's where the work was.  We lost a lot of people there.  So, that's where my family, part of my family's roots were.  My dad was--he worked in a dental lab, the United States Army's dental lab right there in, in Colon in Panama.  He's always had this thing about wanting to be a dentist.  Ironically, that's not the thing that, that made me or helped me to decide that I would go that route.  The thing that really pushed me over the ledge was that this was something that I knew I could do and from the day after graduation I knew I could start practicing without having to go through a song and dance.  I was already older, so that's that was one of the considerations.
Speaker 1: What's considered older?  What were--
Speaker 2: What was I?
Speaker 1: What--how old were you?  What's considered older?
Speaker 2: I finished dental school at 32, 31, 32, somewhere in the region.  When--you know a number of my classmates were 24 or 25, 26 even.
Speaker 1: Approximately '77 [1977].
Speaker 2: '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: '78 [1978].
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: You--
Speaker 2: You're pretty good, you're a math man.
Speaker 1: And that--and you earned--you--the dental degree was that Harvard?
Speaker 2: Howard [University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: I mean Howard.
Story_ID: 179118
Speaker 1: Howard [University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.], and what was that experience like, Howard University 1970, in the '70s [1970s] up until '78 [1978] when you completed it?
Speaker 2: Stressful, but wonderful, wonderful.  I would not have wanted to do it any other way.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your instructors and some of the influential people on campus in, in the '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: As far as dental school was concerned, there were a number of, of instructors and professors that we had in dental school that, that made an impact.  Certainly, Dr. Henry, Joe Henry [Joseph L. Henry] who was our dean, I'm sorry he was presi, he was the dean of the dental school.  He was one person who made an impact.  Well, a lot of them, Dr. [James] Stanback, who was a professor and chairman of the oral surgery department.  In fact, the entire oral surgery department was a superb group of individuals.  There was a gentleman who I was very close to over the years, a Dr. Hancock, Victor Hancock who was a Tuskegee Airmen who just recently, recently passed about a month ago, month and a half ago.  Victor was chairman of American Express, Kenneth Chenault's father-in-law.  Victor, Victor was a very, very unique man.  Dr. Marcus Moore, he wasn't a professor, but he was a doctor who I started working with when I first got out of dental school.  In fact, this was a gentleman that, that my wife and I purchased his practice when I retired.  He has now since passed on.  He was a major force and my, my first father-in-law also was a, was a dentist, that's Dr. Alfred Proctter [ph.] out of Norfolk, Virginia.
Story_ID: 179119
Speaker 1: Dr. Poxcy [ph.]--you were talking about--
Speaker 2: Dr. [Alfred (ph.)] Proctter.
Speaker 1: Proctter.  If you can just spell--oh it's Proctter?
Speaker 2: Proctter, right, right.
Speaker 1: If you can just spell that name out for me.
Speaker 2: P-R-O-C-T-T-E-R.
Speaker 1: And you were saying that he was one of the big influences--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: He was one of the, well not at Howard [University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.], but he was a Howard grad--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but he was one of the big influences as far as my pursuing a career and really going in a direction of dentistry.
Speaker 1: Now, just talk to me what was the atmosphere like at Howard in the '70's [1970s] when you were there?
Speaker 2: At dental school?
Speaker 1: At dental school.
Speaker 2: Well, you have to understand that profession school was very stressful first of all, and there's not a great deal of time that you're gonna have that's free.  You know your day start--my day started at six in the morning and I used to cut it off at two in the morning or if I got tired first because the program was just so intense you had to be in class your first lecture was 8 o'clock in the morning and you were literally going to be there in that school, in that building at least until 5 [o'clock P.M.].  Now, when you got into the clinical years, which is your third and fourth year, the sooner you start in your second year doing lab work.  Then after, after the educational academic day is over with, then you have to know start doing your lab work on patients that you may have taken your impressions on to either fabricate dentures or, or crown and bridge work or whatever the case may be.  So, it was not uncommon to see dental students still in the building in the labs up until 10 o'clock at night, not uncommon at all.  I recall in the first year anatomy is the big backbreaker, I mean, it's, the entire semester in anatomy and it's broken down.  You've got the gross anatomy which deals with the largess of the body, then you've got the structural portion.  There's just a certain portion that talks only about the skeletal portion.  It's one that talks only about the circulatory system.  There's one that talks only about the cells, and it just goes on and on and on and then you have systems within the body and even those systems are broken down into a gross aspect and then also to a histological aspect where you start to look at the various cell formations of each one of the structures and you've gotta know it.  And the gross walk as we used to call it, cadaver walk is an exam, very intense exam that you, that you have to take in order to pass the course.  You've got the whole body laid out right in front of you, and there are tags and strings on certain structures with a number on it.  You have a corresponding answer sheet with numbers and you have to identify that specimen, whatever it is.  You have maybe one minute at each station, and you walk around and they ring a bell and they ring that bell and you move on and that's how you get to learn what the body is like.  There are many people sometimes say well you went to dental school it's, it's interesting how people differentiate dentists from physicians.  Well, in Howard, the first two years you're not a medical student, you're not a dental student, you are a basic science student and for the first two years you're all together.  You know everything that everybody knows.  The difference comes in your clinical years, in your junior year and your senior year and that's going to the hospital and they start to deal with the people in the hospital who are actually complaining of about pain and, and going through all of the various illnesses that you have people in hospitals for.  On the dental side, we now have patients, okay, patients from the school, patients from the community.  You're given ten charts and you're not given much instruction after that point.  They'll give you ten charts and they'll say okay doctor go work, and this is how you begin to learn what the rest of your life is going to be, so very interesting from that standpoint.  Every day was a different day.  You never have enough time, and to this day, to this day I still function on a pretty heavy schedule, 6 a.m. to 2 a.m., so I'm up often, 1, 2 o'clock every night.  Now, part of that is my medical training.  The other part of that is my jazz life, and those things you just never get away from.
Story_ID: 179120
Speaker 1: Talk to me about your jazz life and being a musician.  What did you play?  Or what do you play (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh my jazz life.  Well, let me talk to you about my musical life and then get into my jazz life.  I started playing when I was six, started playing piano when I was six years old, and my sister and I.  And I come from a musical family.  My mother [Winifred Adams Riggs] played organ in the church and I started entering high school wanting to play trumpet like Louis Armstrong.  Why, because my dad [Eric Riggs] used to take me to Louis Armstrong's birthday concert every year up here at City College of New York [New York, New York].  There used to be a concert every year on the Fourth of July where Louis Armstrong would come and play.  It was a--traditionally it was one of those, one of those things, and my dad used to get tickets for us to go every year.  So, when I was 11 years old that's what I wanted to do.  I wanted to play jazz just like Louis Armstrong.  So, it never happened.  In junior high school, I was able to get, get on the band and my band instructor said well all the trumpet slots are gone, but I have something in drums and you know the person playing the trumpet may not want to do it after a week.  Why don't you take this, take the drum slot and maybe after a week or so someone will switch out and you'll be able to switch.  So, I bought it, I bought it lock, stock barrel, I bought it.  In any event, once he put those drumsticks in my hand and he taught me how to, how to use the drumsticks and how to play with it I was sold.  There was no way that I would go and play any other instrument.  So, to make a long story short my musical career, not the piano part of it, began and I was fortunate enough to be able to play in something called the All City Orchestra Band here in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: What is that, wha, what year?
Speaker 2: What is All City?  What year?  Ooh, '50 [1950]... the '50s [1950s], late '50s [1950s], '57 [1957], '58 [1958], somewhere in that neighborhood and I go from there to high school where I was still with the All City Orchestra Band.  At the same time, as I told you, I keep moving around.  At the same time, I played at the, with the, with the Drum and Bugle Corps, Minisink Warriors Drum and Bugle Corps.  You always had to keep your hands busy.  I always had to stay with that, and at the same time I was also beginning to play jazz, which was my love.  I was very fortunate I had two drum instructors that helped me out quite a bit.  One of them lived downstairs from me. I lived on the second floor.  He lived on the first floor.  His name was Jimmy Cobb, a fella who was playing with Miles Davis at the time.  And the other one lived across the street from me his name was Ben Riley and he was playing with Monk at the time, Thelonious Monk's Orchestra.  So, I had these two great influences right where I can reach out and, and touch them and I'd go around with them and particularly with Ben and I'd go to some of the clubs.  I was too young to get into the clubs, but they got me in by, "Here's a guy who's bringing in to carry my instruments" and so I was able to be there and reach out and touch, so to speak.  Once I started hearing that music and once I started playing that music, there was no return, none.  So, it's the music that's dominated my life to this day, and it will dominate my life until the day I die.
Story_ID: 179121
Speaker 1: What was happening with the music when you were at Howard [University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.] when you were in school?  Did you still play?
Speaker 2: School, school.  It wasn't any time to do anything else.  I stopped playing in, physically in '64 [1964] when I went to Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  I sold my drums.  I needed additionally monies to get to college, and I decided that I'd put my drums aside for a while, my musical career for a while, and when I come back I'll get back to it.  I never really did get back to it, not from, not from a perspective of playing music, but I still knock around every now and then.  If I get a chance to sit in some where I do.  One interesting thing about Central State, Central State was a beacon of light to me because there were so many different things happening there at Central State while I was a student.  Central State is a school that had a very strong musical career.  Our department, I'm sorry, which, which is responsible for a lady by the name of Leontyne Price.  She's a graduate of Central State, class of 1948 and class of '51' [1951] as far as jazz is concerned one of my guys, Frank Foster, whose mother was an English instructor there at Central State.  Frank Foster became the leader of the Count Basie band and there's a very, very famous tune that he wrote that everybody plays and it's called Shiny Stockings.  I think everyone knows that.  Whether you know Frank or not, he's the guy who did that.  We boast other people like Cecil McBee in a bass, bass player and in the jazz arena.  Cecil McBee, George Russell came through there sometime back, a piano player.  Joe Ford, who's my classmate, who is now doing quite a bit of work.  He's still act, active on the jazz scene here.  A lot of people that came through there, Stan Strickland up in Boston, another classmate of mine who, who is one of the major tenor forces up in Boston area.  I haven't seen him in quite a while.  I hear from him every now and then.  But, we've had a lot of influences out there.  Nancy Wilson is out of Central State.  We can go on and on and on, but every year at homecoming we have a group, which was called The Collegians, which dates back to the '40's [1940s].  These guys who were playing jazz there, Tommy Grice and we had a brother named GiGi Grice who's an alto saxophone player.  GiGi is no longer with us, but Tommy was his brother.  He was a tenor sax player, come out of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], he comes in.  Tony Williams out of Philadelphia.  We all come back.  Pete Stenson, a trumpet player.  We all come back and after homecoming everyone makes it over to the auditorium there's gonna be a big band jazz concert and we come from all over the country just to do that, and it's just a great, great, great scene.  That's Central State, that's part of it.
Story_ID: 179122
Speaker 1: So, what would you say--like in '78 [1978] when you were finishing up at Howard [University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.] and going into practice for yourself?  What were some of the things that were happening in the world?  Did any of, like, like were you involved politically?  Were you involved in any other groups or were you mainly working to set up a practice for yourself?
Speaker 2: I was involved in business.  I was involved in politics from afar.  That's not something that you wanna be involved in.  I didn't want to be involved in that closer than I was, closer than I am now, but business was really the thing that, that spurred me.  I know that--I read an article in Black Enterprise while was, I believe, a freshmen or sophomore in dental school about a couple in Detroit [Michigan] that owned a radio station and for some reason that's something that just kind of hit me as you know, that's what I wanna do.  Not own a radio station, but go into business.  As, as I read the articles, I read more of the article come to find out this gentleman was also a dentist, so I knew.  So, when I came back to New York I came back home in '78 [1978], I had a very good friend of mine who was a former, who was a graduate of Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] as well who was talking to me about establishing and forming a new Stock exchange.  I didn't know what that meant.  He asked me if I wanted a piece of it.  I said sure tell me where it meets.  So, even though I was involved in it for about two or three years I really didn't understand it and understand the concept, but I knew this was something that I wanted to sink my teeth into.  Well, we went ahead and we formed a new stock exchange in this country.  It was called, we called it the American Small Business Stock Exchange.  That's what we called it back then and then we shortly changed the name to Small Business Stock Exchange of America so that there would not be a conflict with the American Stock Exchange; so, we changed the name.  And I think that truly my education really began at that point; it really began at that point.  Although I had a bachelor's at that point, I had a master's at that point, I had a DDS at that point, my education really began when we started talking about starting a stock exchange because it then opened the world to me and it taught me that the rest of the world is really important and there were things about what was going on in the world that we never learned in school, it made more sense to me, more practical sense and so I've been involved in business for, since, ever since.
Story_ID: 179123
Speaker 1: So just talk to me about what this, what, exactly what the stock exchange [Small Business Stock Exchange of America] is.  Explain it to me--
Speaker 2: What the stock exchange was?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay this stock exchange--
Speaker 1: --the way it was explained to you to--
Speaker 2: I can't, I can't explain it the way it was explained to me, I can tell you what, what it is--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because as I learned it.  This stock exchange was a, a stock exchange designed for small business.  It was designed to bring to the public marketplace those small companies that could not get financing.  They couldn't get access to capital okay, the limits on capital requirements in this country.  If for instance, you wanted to open up a business and you needed let's say 6 million dollars where would you go?  You couldn't go to the banks.  The banks would say that we can't loan you that, that's too much money for us to loan.  We actually don't, we don't have that.  You could go to family and friends to raise that kind of capital, so the next place for you to go then would be to the capital markets put together in private placement, and try to sell your idea to the general public and have them finance it by buying stock in the individual company.  That's how it's done, okay.  Now, there is a lapse and there's a big gap between what one or, or a group of people can raise by way of going to the banks and what you're gonna actually need.  There's a gap in between and in that gap that's where you need to be.  You can't be there because you can only raise from here down.  If you're large enough, if you wanna set up a company called International Business Machines [IBM], for instance, and you need 60 million dollars or 6 billion dollars then you go to the New York Stock Exchange and that's where you'll get the financing for that portion there, but all in between here there's nothing.  So, access to capital has become a mantra in business, a mantra in small business.  So, we established this exchange, which was designed to do that.  We joined an international group of secondary market exchanges.  They're called secondary markets overseas.  Here we call it small business.  Over there it's called secondary markets.  We became the thirteenth member of an organization that had twenty-eight members which involved most European nations, Japan, Malta, England, you name it.  We were the thirteenth member.  We would have been the only American group that had an exchange of its size to do this.  It didn't get off the ground, didn't get off the ground, but it was an experience but again that, that's when my business life began and that's when my education truly, truly began.
Speaker 1: So what happen it didn't get off the ground?  --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: We actually just--
Speaker 1: --in the '80s [1980s] or it--
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-three, we started in 1983, incorporated in 1984, Delaware Corporation and we just put it to bed in February of last year, 2004, after twenty-one years.  We couldn't get the financing.  We couldn't get the support from Congress.  You need to get support from Congress in order for this to happen.  So, these were the kinds of things that, that happened.  These are the reasons that small businesses don't, are not successful.  Quite frankly, we didn't have enough money to pay everybody off; that's the bottom line.
Speaker 1: But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's the reality.
Story_ID: 179124
Speaker 1: But, you yourself had bought a dental practice from Dr. [Alfred (ph.)] Proctter?
Speaker 2: Dr. [Marcus] Moore.
Speaker 1: Dr. Moore.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, you were in business for yourself?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And on the side you were trying to establish also the stock exchange?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How was the private--how, how were you as a dentist?  How was that business coming along in, in '82 [1982]?
Speaker 2: Good, good, good.  We don't have enough patients from time to time.  And, and part of that, part of the reason for that is we have, we have an office in Harlem [New York, New York].  Harlem is changing now, but it, it wasn't always changing, but we have an office in Harlem whereby our patient pool is not as extensive as it would be if it were in downtown areas.  I did have an office in the downtown area at one point, but the exorbitant overhead chased me out of there and again the Civil War is still being fought.  So, I went back home where I felt more comfortable.
Speaker 1: You know what's strange I've never had a black dentist in my life--
Speaker 2: There we go.
Speaker 1: --so I'm pleased to meet you.  I'm pleased to meet one.
Speaker 2: There we go.
Speaker 1: And I, but I grew up in Mississippi, where, you know...
Story_ID: 179125
Speaker 1: So let's talk about developing the practice.  How, how did you go about doing that?  I mean you're a young man, you're straight out of Howard's dental school [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.], you buy the practice and what's the day-to-day life--?
Speaker 2: Well, that didn't happen automatically.  You come out of dental school and, and one of the things that you want to do, if at all possible, is to secure a post-graduate training program.  Then we didn't have that many post-graduate training programs in dentistry.  The difference between getting post-graduate dental training and post-graduate medical training is that every physician that finishes medical school has his name on a residency somewhere in this country.  It may be his or her first choice; it might not be his or her first choice, but they have their name on a residency program somewhere in his country.  It's sort of the next step.  In dentistry, there not that many residency programs around.  We're getting better, it's growing, but these residency programs are so highly coveted and so highly competitive and very, very difficult to get.  So, my first year out of school I worked with Dr. Moore in the office and looking around for other opportunities because you can walk into an office and see patients lined up wall to wall every day.  It wasn't like that.  It's not like that today.  So, oftentimes you found yourself sitting around twirling your thumbs looking at the four walls.  Part of that is that a lot of our patients now are not staying uptown, they're going downtown.  They're going elsewhere were we don't go because we can't go for whatever reasons.  But, you just happen to mention it's ironic that you, you don't have a black dentist, you didn't know many.  Well, that's the story that a lot of people are beginning to talk about now.  They're saying I never had a black, a black doctor before.  You know one of the patients that I had is during my residency program--I did get a residency program--Sydenham Hospital [New York, New York] on 125th Street which just really broke my heart.  I was on emergency service one day and a woman came in she was obviously upwards of eighty.  She came in on emergency basis and she had a, denture work being done there at the hospital.  She came in and she had a complaint that whenever she drank hot tea that her teeth just kept moving and I just thought gee that didn't sound unusual, that's sounded a little, a little unusual.  So, I asked her more questions and, heat sort of oriented questions, when you eat hot food do the teeth move around, you know tell me more.  She said well anytime she eats or when she drinks hot tea the teeth just seems to move.  So, I said okay well let me just take a look at, at your denture.  I had took out the denture, and you know what she was wearing, she was wearing what we call a trial denture.  This is a denture that we set in wax before it's sent to the lab to be fabricated.  Someone let this woman go out with a trial denture, the teeth sat in wax as the competed denture.  And the thing that broke my heart about it was that she said to me, she kept staring and I wondered if there was something wrong and I said well, I can't recall her name now, I said is there a problem.  She says no, she said you make me so proud I've never had a black doctor before, but she was upwards of eighty years old.  That broke my heart.  So, we deal with some of that.  But, you know, you get through it and so these are the kinds of things that, that had another dimension to your life and you try to make it better, you try to change things, if you can.  So, overall, the dental practice is one of the most positive things in my life.  I enjoy it.  My wife's [HM Carol Morales] a dentist.  She does a lot of the general work--she's a HistoryMaker as well, and I now come in and I do the difficult surgical procedures and that's what I really enjoy; I enjoy that.
Story_ID: 179126
Speaker 1: So, what are you doing as far as the business, the business you love so much?  What are you doing now, or what have you done since, I mean, while that business only, you only stopped the stock exchange last year?
Speaker 2: We stopped that last year, but I'm a true Gemini as I said, you know, things keep going around.  One deal will always lead to another.  One thing always leads to another.  Right now I'm involved with a number of individuals we're trying to build a new hospital, a teaching hospital in the Bahamas.  And in order to underpin the, the, the expense of running the hospital, we have to also build a medical school, a dental school, school nursing, and school pharmacy.  So, we're involved in that venture, and it's, it's a long-time project, but it'll work.
Story_ID: 179127
Speaker 1: So I see that in '97 [1997] you went back to school.
Speaker 2: Actually no, I went back to school in '95 [1995].  I went back to business school in '95 [1995] because at that point we were still dealing with the stock exchange, so I went back to business school and got a MBA in finance and international business with my concentration being in capital markets because that's where we were, that's where I was.  And that's another one of those hallmark decisions that you make in life that's been a very, very positive decision for me.  It's given me a totally, totally different dimension from what it is I'm involved in on a day-to-day basis.
Speaker 1: What do--
Speaker 2: So, so, it, it tells you that life, life really is cyclic, because what I wanted to do in '68 [1968] if you remember when I got out of school was to go to law school and specialize in taxation and finance and get a MBA, combined MBA, so '97 [1997] I'm right back there.  I got the MBA in finance, not in taxation, but back in there.
Story_ID: 179128
Speaker 1: A great place to start is talking about the mindset of America when you, in, in the '70s [1970s] or to just proceed.
Speaker 2: In the '70s [1970s], well I, I think I was referring back to, you asked a question as to, to the differences between, between being, being a black dentist and being some other, some other racial ethnic group, and there is no difference in terms of how we have been trained and in terms of how and, and in terms of what we know and how we achieve what it is we have to achieve.  Our specialty area is the oral cavity and as a person who has done a post-graduate training in a residency program, it seems as though the residency programs in the city, particularly at the city hospitals, always seem to feel like we need to make you a surgeon, you see, and so in all likelihood what you'll find in many of the programs, depending on where the programs are, that they will attempt to make you what they want you to be.  It just so happens that in the city hospital where I did my residency and it being in Harlem [New York, New York] we had--(unclear)--for training us to become, even though it was a general practice residency program, they had--(unclear)--for training us to become better oral surgeons.  So, from that perspective it was, it was a real good program.  It did separate us from the pool, and I have to take you back a few years to during World War II [WWII] during that period of time whereby in the early '50s [1950s] a lot of the dentists who were working at Harlem Hospital, in particular, and in some of the other black hospitals that were in inner city neighborhoods they was, they, they would, they seeked these guys out and they drafted those guys and they wanted them to be a part of the [U.S.] Army dental team.  They picked them first, and the reason for it is that we dealt with a lot of trauma.  We dealt with a lot of head and neck trauma.  We dealt with a lot of gunshot wounds.  We dealt with a lot of stabbing and, and that sort of them, you know, this, these were the hospitals when they, the ambulance picked up a lot of these people who might have had those kinds of injuries in different parts of the city they knew if they took 'em anywhere else they gonna die.  Let's take 'em uptown to Harlem because they know how to deal with these injuries.  So, the program that, that I was a part of was one of those that had that philosophy, you know, you're gonna be a head and neck specialist basically for the most part.  So, when Dr. [Marcus] Moore and, and Dr. [Alfred (ph.)] Proctter, my, my former father-in-law, would tell me stories about their experiences in the [U.S.] Army, Dr. Curry [ph.] all of these guys who all went into the Army and the reason they picked them up there, they drafted them and brought them in was because they had this experience of knowing how to deal with head and neck injuries.  So, if you have to ask me what you did, what separates us, I would say that after your basic training and, and dental school, nothing separates you.  What separates you is what you learn after that.
Story_ID: 179129
Speaker 1: Now, something that I was a part of--let me step back if I were in this city [New York, New York], if I were a white dentist downtown I had the benefit of white patients, black patients, Hispanic patients, Asian patients, stripped patients, pink patients, blue patients, polka dot patients.  That's eight, eight different patient pools.  But, I'm a black doctor and practicing in an inner city neighborhood and I had the benefits of dealing with black patients.  Hispanic patients I could count on one or two hands.  Any other types of patients they don't exist in my--(unclear)--in my practice.  That's the reality, that's the reality.  When I had an office downtown, someone called to make an appointment on the phone and I talked to them on the phone and the last question the patient asked me was doc if you don't mind what nationality, what nationality are you?  Well, it doesn't matter you won't be happy here.  That was the response because I know you're coming in with a different mindset.  I'm here to provide a service, I'm not here to deal in racial issues.  That's my situation.  So, you go through a lot of different things.  I'm very happy as a dentist, and I'm very happy doing what I do.
Story_ID: 179130
Speaker 1: I think the hallmark of my dental career is something that was totally, totally unexpected and that was with this 9/11 situation [September 11, 2001].  I mentioned that I retired from the [U.S.] military.  I was the commander of the North Atlantic Regional Dental Command.  There are six regions [U.S.] Army-wide.  We have four regions here.  We have one region in the Pacific, which is based in Honolulu [Hawaii], and we have one region in Europe, which is based on Germany.  I was the commander of the North Atlantic Regional Dental Command on the reserve side.  I had twenty-one states, all of the doctors, or reservists, dental assistants, lab techs, and I was deputy commander on the active duty side at the same time, which incorporates all of the active duty DENTAC [Dental Activity] facilities as far north as Fort Drum, New York, as far south as Fort Bragg, North Carolina, as far west as Fort Knox in Kentucky, and as far north in the Midwest as Wisconsin Fort McCoy.  So, I had a tremendous responsibility of providing backfill and in some cases troops who had to be deployed out to areas of conflict.  As a result of being the commander of the North Atlantic Region when 9/11 came by, the dental command, which is based in Texas in Fort Sam Houston, called me and told me that they wanted me to go up to New York, which was easy for me it was home and to represent the United States Army dental command and do what I can to help or see how we can help.  So, for ten months I worked at the medical examiner's office along with my local dentist society here in identifying remains of victims for ten months.  Had you told me ten years ago that I would have an interest or be involved in forensic dentistry I'd have to say to you, you drinking the wrong kind of tea.  But, you never know what direction your life is gonna go in, and this turned out to be one of the most important things that I have ever done, very significant, being able to bring closure to families from a senseless act like what occurred in 9/11.  Has nothing, absolutely nothing to do with color, which is a good thing, has nothing to do with race, which is a good thing, has nothing to do with anything else other than humanity; that's what it's all about and that's all we want is to be viewed as people as humans to do what we do.  So, we have a lot of attitudes.  We have a lot of opinions about a lot of different things.
Story_ID: 179131
Speaker 1: You mentioned Mississippi.  Not one of my favorite states, but Mississippi has a long history, very long history, and I'm told that Mississippi is a lot different today.  I don't go back there.  It's--
Speaker 2: When were you there?
Speaker 1: --something I don't talk about a lot, don't like to talk about it.  I was there in the '60s [1960s], and I'm lucky that I got out.  But, I like to think that we've come a long way; I'd like to think that.  Somehow we still haven't, but I'd like to think that.
Speaker 2: What were you doing there in the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 1: Voter registration, that's what we were doing in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: And you were working with?
Speaker 1: SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee].
Speaker 2: SNCC, and you don't like to talk about it because?
Speaker 1: Brings back too many memories, brings back a lot of memories.  We lost a lot of people.  In any event, life goes on.
Speaker 2: You were fighting for me and I appreciate it and here I stand today.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  Life goes on.  That's one of the things that we were talking about earlier about our generation and the generation behind us.  I think I started talking to you about one of the things that opened up some doors for me when I left the city [New York, New York] and went to Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  We had a mandatory course that we all had to take.  It was a one-year history course, History of the Negro Prior to 1865.  I think that's what we were called back then.  First semester, second semester History of the Negro After 1865 and coming from Harlem and New York I just couldn't figure out, didn't even know what the significance of 1865 was.  Well, we figured out and we learned from the historical approach that the emancipation, pro, proclamation was actually in 1861, so that's why the 1865 demarcation and then--(unclear)--became during that period as well.  I was taught, we were taught things that we never ever knew, we never heard before about history, not white history, not black history, history.  We were taught the things that occurred during a certain period of time were recorded in certain places and when you looked at the history books that we all had growing up, of course you grew up in Mississippi so you probably had a different interpretation yet of what occurred and the making or the growth of this country at a certain point in time and the history of, of this country.  I don't know what you were taught.  I know what I wasn't taught here in the North, and when I went to this school and we had this course it just changed my life around and opened up Pandora's Box, I guess you could say, and at that point I started really searching for a lot of meaning for everything.  If I hear something mentioned somewhere, well I'm gonna look for what that means.  I'm gonna look for the implications behind it all.  I'm gonna look for is there another side and if there is what is it?  This is how you become a learned person.  This is why I talk to older people because their experiences are much more valuable to me than anything that I can read in a book.  The book only reflects history to a certain point.
Story_ID: 179132
Speaker 1: You know we were talking about Wright State University [Dayton, Ohio] earlier and Central State University [Wilberforce, Ohio].  There, there was a law on the books in the State of Ohio which says that the state cannot support a state institution within a fifteen, a fifteen mile, a fifty mile radius of each other, fifty.  So, there were no state institutions closer than fifty miles.  Well, when I went to Central State, the state of Ohio established Wright State University, which was only fifteen miles from Central State University.  Central State University was a small black school in Ohio right across the street from Wilberforce University [Wilberforce, Ohio], which again is another small black school.  But, Wilberforce University is a, a church-supported school by the AME Church and Central State was a state-supported school, State, Central State.  Now Central State is an outgrowth of Wilberforce University.  It was the industrial arts department of Wilberforce University which moved out and became Central State College and then Central State University.  But, we had our start back in 1887.  We've never had more than 2500 students.  Well Wright State started in 19, 1964, '65 [1965], and today Wright State has an undergraduate school, they've got a graduate school, and they've got a medical school, and they've got a little under 20,000 students and we're struggling for a little, we're under 1700 students now at Central State and the state all of a sudden wants to enforce legislation which is going to wipe out the institution by cutting them, cutting the funding.  Well, we had to write to the state legislature in Ohio.  We had to write members of the education subcommittee dealing with this budgetary issue, and what I simply wrote to them as alums and then as a former national president of alumni association, what I simply wrote to them was to come back and talk to them about the Morrill Act, which was an act that was created by the state legislature back in, in 1840 [sic, 1862] which established Central State University and established the fund, which would, would incorporate that and is out of this same fund actually that the Ohio State University [Columbus, Ohio] was founded.  So, if you say to me in, in 2005 that we're cutting your budget because you're no longer relevant, well wait a minute, why are we turning back the clock when the Morrill Act specifically states X, Y, and Z.  And I'm sure that the letter that I wrote to a number of the legislatures, legislators didn't, didn't read that section and that they probably were not aware of this act, not that it's gonna make a difference.  They're gonna do what they wanna do anyway because they have a game plan.  But, you make a little bit more difficult when you put that in writing and you put it out there that you're operating under the assumption that this law doesn't exist.  It does exist because you employed for our state and you obviously employed it for Wright State.  So, you have to know history.  There's an old African proverb that says a man that has no history, if he has no history, he has nowhere to go, any road will get him there.  Think about it.  A man has no history, any road will get you there.  So, you've gotta know that in order to answer some of the questions that will pop up in modern day.  We, I think as a, as a, as an American society I believe we've lost our way.  We've lost our way.  We don't have students in schools today that can speak more than one language.  We don't have students in school today that are interested in mathematics, engineering, in the sciences.  All of that information is being drained out by other nations, other countries.  And if you look at the students in this country today, whether they're citizens or not citizens, you look at them, the ones who are making the most strides are from some other nation.  We've lost our way.
Story_ID: 179133
Speaker 1: What's different about today you feel then when you were in school?  What were, what access did you have that perhaps we don't have today?  Just what was different?  What--was the ideology different, people different, was the community different?
Speaker 2: I think the most dramatic different today is that we are a more highly technological society and as a result we're more rooted in, in going to the Internet to do a lot of our research.  You have to really be suspect of what's being put on the Internet and who puts it on there and by what authority.  No one questions any of that.  Now, let me ask you a question by talking to you about a report that we put together in business school.  When you go to business school, you know, you're grouped together in groups because that's the way corporate America has begun to work over the last 15 years or so everything works in groups now.  So, they start to train you in business school to work in groups because now this is the way you're gonna have to move into corporate America if you go that route by working together.  Well, I think, our report, my group, a group of four of us, our group was given it was an oil company, an American oil company as the company that we had to do our report on and we have something called a sweat analysis that we learned in business school, the strengths, the weaknesses, the opportunities, and the threats, and I happen to have been away when the assignments were given, or at least when the assignments were taken, I happen to be away on some military, something or the other.  I came back and I had the threat, the threat analysis, the, the entire analysis of the program and I said fine well I'll do the threat analysis, but the interesting thing about when we had to do that, give that report, every member of my committee got up there with papers of information that they downloaded from the Internet and they came in and they literally read what was there.  That's not a report in my opinion.  Be that as it may, we sat there, I sat there and I listened to it and I went on last because the threat analysis is always the last.  What are the threats and what are the imposing situations that would threatening the success of the operation of this oil company, so to speak.  So, I went up there first of all and didn't have any notes.  I had a couple of slides that I put together of all the OPEC [Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries] nations, all nations who produce oil in the world.  Before I did that, I wrote up on the board the names of five countries and I asked if they all knew the significance of the countries.  I was surprised that they--(unclear)--said yeah that was, that was OPEC nations.  I was surprised that they even knew that, but they knew that and I said these are the countries that we've heard about as long as we've been on this earth and that we are going to be hearing about these countries until the day we die and they are the OPEC nations and I went on to give a, an analysis of OPEC when and its history, historically when OPEC started, who their leaders were, and I put this slide up there that showed all of the oil-producing nations and I color-coated them and the countries that I listed in green obviously those were western nations.  The countries that were listed in red obviously those were nations that were communists, inspired a communist leaning.  The, the countries that I listed in purple they were monarchies, you know, unilateral kinds of controlling interests, and I just broke it down that way.  We've talked about OPEC.  We've talked about these countries.  We've talked about some of what's going on in the world.  I was very careful not to reveal anything that I know from my military background, but we've talked about exactly the kinds of things that is a threat, not only to this little small country here in America, but to the oil industry in general.  We talked about all of those things.  I didn't have a note because I had that reserve.  I didn't have a note, and it's very interesting that some of the same situations that I talked about back then in 1996, '95 [1995], '96 [1996], '97 [1997] were turned around and here we are.  Again, it's about doing your homework.  It's about connecting the dots.
Story_ID: 179134
Speaker 1: To me, to get back to your question as to what's different in today's educational environment than it was back then, back then we went and looked up information.  We always looked for information.  You went to sources that you knew could give you the information you needed.  Today, you just sit on a computer and you just go to the Internet.  Again, you don't know who the author is of any of the information that you are pulling up, even to the point of talking about mathematics today.  You got to--I don't know what they charge, but you go to McDonalds or you go to KFC and you, you make a purchase.  Let's just say your purchase comes up to twenty, twenty-one dollars and maybe thirty-two cents and you give that clerk thirty-one dollars and thirty-two cents and whatever the case maybe you're always gonna get the wrong change back unless the computer tells him exactly how much your change is.  They don't know how to count anymore because we went to, we went to calculators, which gives you the answer instantly, then we go the computers, which gives you the answers instantly, but if you were without computer, if you were without calculator and you had pen and pencil and paper, they'd have a very difficult time coming up with the answer.  So, I think that technology is good, but I also think that technology puts handcuffs on educational and academic creativity.  That's what's different today.  The other thing that's different today is that the educational system today is really not teaching history of the respective field like we're studying.  We get it in medicine and dentistry.  You get it in mathematics because there is no way you can offset that, you've got to get it in those areas, but you're not getting it in the social sciences.  You're not getting it in those fields, you see.  If you get into English and literature, you're getting it there because you're not gonna remake the wheel.  And in music, you're not gonna remake the wheel.  If you listen to jazz and if you're really an avid listener, if you know about music and the classics, you can hear a lot of classical rifts coming right out of, right out of some of the classics.  You hear Bach, you have Beethoven, Shostakovich, you hear all of them in jazz, but you've gotta be in tune to music and if you're not then you'll miss it.  We have hip hop music; that's not my, my thing, but you know, I don't knock it to, to some extent, but I see these electronic musicians jumping around on stage and they're breaking instruments on the stage I still struggle to hear the music and I don't hear it.  I'm not hearing it.  I don't get it.  There's no connection.  Dots are not being connected.
Story_ID: 179135
Speaker 1: So we're gonna talk about your military career.  Is '95 [1995] a good place to start when you, is that when you became the liaison between [the United States Military Academy at] West Point [West Point, New York] and the [U.S.] military?
Speaker 2: Yeah that's, that, that's, that's a fairly decent place to start, '95 [1995] yeah, yeah that's a good place to start.  The rest of it is not important.
Speaker 1: Why is not important?
Speaker 2: It's just not important.
Speaker 1: What was happening before '95 [1995]?
Speaker 2: Nothing actually.  I was the, I was the coordinator of the IMAs at Fort Bragg, but that was a very good assignment for me.  It was a good assignment.  Actually, my, my military career really changed once I came back from Desert Storm [the Gulf War].  So, it's been positive ever since then, ever since I came back.  It was good.
Speaker 1: What--(unclear)--?
Speaker 2: I came back in, I came back in '91 [1991], yeah, '91 [1991].  It was, it's pretty, it's been pretty good since then.
Speaker 1: What was the experience like when you were at Desert Storm?  What were you doing?
Speaker 2: Being away from home, you know, then what can I tell you.
Speaker 1: What were you doing?
Speaker 2: You know you got a family, you're away from home and it's, it's not a good feeling.  The worst part of it is that we left, we left two days before Christmas, two days before Christmas, so it's different.  There's some experiences that you know you don't talk about.  It's some of those, some of the things--well we didn't see a lot.  We lost, I believe we lost 101 soldiers in Desert Storm and they were all killed--they were all on R and R getting ready to get on this ferry to go on R and R and then something happened and the boat capsized and they all drowned.  That's how we lost those people.  They weren't combat injuries, but that's how we lost them.
Speaker 1: What was your job?
Speaker 2: I was stationed in the OR [operating room] at Nurnberg Hospital, [Nurnberg] Army Hospital [Nuremberg, Germany], and Nurnberg, Landstuhl [Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, Germany], and Frankfurt [Army Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany]; those were the three major hospital set up to receive all the casualties that we expected.  And since it didn't happen, it was a good thing.  So, instead of being in the OR sitting around twiddling your thumbs and you go to work right in the dental clinic, which is what we did.  So, they worked out very well, worked out well.
Story_ID: 179136
Speaker 1: So you come back in '92 [1992], [91] 1991, '92 [199]--
Speaker 2: '91 [1991].
Speaker 1: --'91 [1991] what happens next?
Speaker 2: As far as what?
Speaker 1: The military, your career in the military.
Speaker 2: Well I thought I quit when I came back, but I put papers in to get out because I just wasn't, I wasn't there.  They said, you know, you've gotta be; I wasn't there.  I put papers to get out.  Some sergeant, someone that was looking out for my interest because I had more time in than I, than I--I had a lot of time in and if you quit, though you get out, you know you lose that time.  You get no retirement.  So, some sergeant who was looking out for my interest at the time conveniently lost my papers, my request to get out, so I was still in.  I was still locked in, and there was no way I could get out at that point.  So, I went in to something called IMA, individual mobilization augmentee, which was perfect for me and I was stationed down at Fort Bragg [North Carolina] and I'd been down at Fort Bragg for a while until about ninety, '98 [1998] or so, '98 [1998], '99 [1999].  In any event, that, that position put me in line for commander position of the region and that's, that's what happened.  I got pulled from there, and I got picked up and pulled into the commander's position.  Fort Bragg was still a part of my ages.  That was one of my, my places.  So, it worked out well.
Speaker 1: And in that command position you were responsible for recruitment is when that started?
Speaker 2: You mean at [the United States Military Academy at] West Point [West Point, New York]?
Speaker 1: At West Point?
Speaker 2: No, that's totally different.
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's two separate entities.
Speaker 1: Okay so then--
Speaker 2: That's totally separate.
Speaker 1: --how did you get to West Point from the commander's position?
Speaker 2: I was placed there by, by central office in St. Louis [Missouri].  I was placed at West Point because of my close proximity to West Point, half hour away and I started off as just a liaison officer recruiting for West Point.  We recruited in the New York City area, but being African American I had also a national footprint that I can recruit from anywhere because we didn't have the numbers of minorities applying to the academy that they wanted.  So, that's how they brought people like me in to try to boost the numbers.  But, it's a hard sale.  West Point is not a hard sale for most folks, but West Point's a hard sell for minorities.  It's translated as such.  I go to West Point or Air Force Academy or Annapolis, but if I go to West Point I finish, I go in the war, I'll get killed.  That's the translation when we talk to our kids.  That's how they're thinking without knowing that if war breaks out everybody under the age of thirty-seven is gone, everybody.  But, you don't want that in front of your, but it's in front of you every day if you're in the academy.  The reality is as well if you can qualify to go to the academy you, that also means that Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] wants you, [University of] Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] wants you, UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] wants you, every other major institution wants you, so why go there when I can go to one of these other schools and I don't have this other precondition of saying that when I finish I've got a five-year military obligation because that's what it is.  You have a five-year military obligation after you finish as a commissioned officer.
Story_ID: 179137
Speaker 1: And how did you do it?  How did you sell [the United States Military Academy at] West Point [West Point, New York] to the, to minorities?  How did you--
Speaker 2: Well, I, I basically went to, to the kids who were interested in going to West Point.  I didn't try to convince anybody that West Point was the place for them no more so than I try to convince someone that dentistry is a way for you to go.  If you call me and you say to me I'm interested in going to West Point or I'm interested in going to dental school and I'll spend all the time in the world talking to you about it, okay.  I was not put on this earth to bust anybody's bubble that might be that kid's dream, and it's not for me to bust their bubble, you see, so I went the path of least resistance.  I went to those who were interested first and then we talked about it.  We talked about the pros, we talked about the cons, we talked about the career.  We talked about all those possibilities, and that's the way you can be successful.  You go where the need is.
Story_ID: 179138
Speaker 1: So, you have since retired?
Speaker 2: I've since retired.
Speaker 1: How does that feel?
Speaker 2: Wonderful, wonderful.  You know being a part of the military is, is, is like a large fraternity; it really is.  There's a lot of commonalities that we have with all of our military brothers regardless of the service, whether you're [U.S.] Air Force, [U.S.] Navy, [U.S.] Marines; it doesn't matter.  We have that commonality, that's common thread, and we all know how we were trained.  We all know what we know; we all know what we don't know.  And we also know that as far as officers are concerned, we are sort of all, we're all in the same mold so to speak.  There's some people who walk a little at the center, but you know we're all of the same mold, of the same yolk so to speak.  We're not all of the same mental framework.  We're not all of the same political persuasion.  We're not all anything, but all of that goes by the wayside when you start talking about military and military experiences.  So, it's a totally different ballgame.
Story_ID: 179139
Speaker 1: Talk to me about some of the organizations you're, you are a member of, 100 Black Men?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in fact I'm no longer a member of 100 Black Men.  I used to be a member of the board of 100 black men for about fifteen years.
Speaker 1: So you were there--when did it, when was it founded?
Speaker 2: I believe the New York [New York] chapter, which was the, the granddaddy of them all, was started in nineteen seventy--early 1970s.  I think when I joined it must have been about six or seven years old at that point.  And from that the national organization grew, first in New Jersey and then from there it spread out to the rest of the country.
Speaker 1: So, when you joined, what was the mission of the organization at that time?
Speaker 2: Keep our fingers on a pulse.  That's what it was, New York City, and we had our finger on the pulse of the city.  Whatever was going on in the city we knew about it because we had people who were working in various agencies in the city that kept us abreast.  You know, we'd get into a board meeting, we'd close the door, we talked about it and nothing came out, nothing got outside because you didn't want to read some of that information in the papers.  So, we kept our pulse on what was going on in the city.  It was a great organization for that, and at the same time it was also a good organization for getting professionals together and promoting professionals in their respective areas of expertise, and that was the real essence of, of that organization.
Speaker 1: What other organizations are you a member of?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, a fraternity that I pledged when I was an undergrad, when I was here actually.  Let's see I became a member in 1964.  Something to remember now when its forty-one years, forty-one years.  Now, I remember the retired officers association, association of the United States Army, the Boule.  There's so many groups that I've been a part of and gotten away from and that's been a process.
Speaker 1: What can you share with us about Boule?
Speaker 2: Not much, not much.  What I can share with you about the Boule is that it's the first graduate fraternity African American males, although it's not totally African American males, which was started in 1906.   It's an old organization that--I'm sorry 1904.  I didn't, I did not mean 1906.  Alpha Phi Alpha was 1906.  It's an old organization that built on familial relationships with many of those relationships going back to the turn of the first of the last century.  So, you had a lot of fathers and sons and uncles and cousins and in-laws and, that, that are members, but not exclusively not today.  There's a book out that, that's written by one of our members that I guess it's a matter of public record now, but, but his accounts may not be as accurate as, as they could be.  So, that tells you a little bit about the Boule.  It's, was found by six doctors in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] at a time when there was a great deal of political activity in Philadelphia.  You might recall and remember that [W.E.B.] Du Bois had the Niagara Movement going, and that was there in Philadelphia.  NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] was founded in Philadelphia.  National Urban League was founded in Philadelphia.  And these are the seats of, this was the seat of civilization so to speak of some of these organizations right at the turn of the century, so, that's why it was Philadelphia.  Great organization.

Speaker 1: So if we go, if we go back through the years you lived so many lives what are some of the highlights of those different lives?
Speaker 2: So many.  How much time do we have?  I've had a lot of, lot of highlights.  Growing up in Harlem [New York, New York] was, was an experience that has always been positive and then didn't know until after I became an adult how important that was and where I was and what it would ultimately mean to, to my own personal development.  So, that was a highlight.  I've had the fortune of meeting a number of people that, and knowing a lot of people that again I didn't know how important they were and either came out of the church or came out of some activity that I was a part of.  Musically I had the fortune of, of, of, of meeting [Thelonious] Monk, the whole Monk family.  I knew them and I also have had the fortune of, of, playing in the early days with someone from Chicago who wasn't really known when he came here.  Nobody knew him.  We barely knew him, a guy named [HM] Herbie Hancock.  I just knew he was one hell of a musician, you know, and I'm happy with how his career has turned out and what he has accomplished in the music business.  Played around with a number of guys when I was playing actively on the music scene.  Freddy was one.  He also came, he came in from Indianapolis.  We're going back to about '58 [1958], '59 [1959] when they first came here.  Tito Puente, I didn't play with him, but I knew him.  I got a chance to, to meet him.  I got a chance to play with [Babatunde Michael] Olatunji a couple of times, the African motif, Dexter Gordon once.  That was really a highlight of my, my entire career.  And I knew a lot, a lot of the guys on the scene, a lot of musicians on the scene and got a chance to meet some of the leaders in New York City [New York] at the time.  That's, that's why I pledged Alpha because they were all there and I thought I wanted to be where they were and went that route so because they were-- most of the, 90 percent of the black college presidents at that time were all Alphas and the fortune of meeting one of the most important Alphas ever in the history of our fraternity was Charles Wesley.  Dr. Wesley was president of Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] at the time.  He was also former national present of Alpha Phi Alpha, but he is also the historian of our history book.  He is also a historian of our Boule history book.  So, I had a, had a real good opportunity of not only just meeting, but knowing him over the years, and his family.
Speaker 1: What's he like?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What's he like?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh I would still like to grow up to be like that man.  Big, he was a giant.  He was a giant, and there are a number of giants that, you know, you meet along the way, people that you learn certain things from, and Charles Wesley certainly was one of those people.  Bedford Lawson was one of those people.  My, my uncle was one of those people.  Sam[uel DeWitt] Proctor, Dr. Proctor who was a very, very unique Baptist minister, unique, president of two colleges.  He and [Robert] Sargent Shriver together worked to write the format for the Peace Corp.  I never got a chance to meet Dr. King who was one of his best friends, but had been in his presence, but never met him really.  A lot of influences in life, lot of influences, highlights in life.  I've had a great musical career.  I've had a fabulous academic career.  I've had a, I've had a good sports life.  I've got a good business life.  I've got great family, and that's the key, a great family.  And all of the older people that I talk to those are the highlights and to see, to see my own daughter to grow to become a lawyer, you know, these are highlights.  It's almost like when I open my eyes every day the sun is shining, you know.  That's a big question.  I can't answer it all, but those are some of the influences and some of the people, and I'm, I'm not mentioning a lot because I'm just drawing a mental blank right now, but, but I've had a very, very, I've had a good life.  I've been fortunate.

Speaker 1: So, why do you, why did you agree to be a part of The HistoryMakers?
Speaker 2: Julieanna [Richardson] twisted my arm for one thing, but no I just thought it was something that was needed based on what I was told that The HistoryMakers would do.  If this is something that's going to be shown to kids and students in schools they need to see people like me who had the kind of career that I had, that doesn't have a big a name as Michael Jordan or as Michael Jackson or any of the, the educators or any of the scientists or politicians.  My name is not that big, and I'm glad that it isn't, but I think that if this is going to be shown to schools and students through this nation they need to know that you don't need to have a big name you just have to have a big impact and that there are other things that you can do in life besides doing the obvious.  So, that's why I agreed to do this.
Story_ID: 179142
Speaker 1: Why do you think history is important?
Speaker 2: History is the hallmark of our civilization basically.  That old African proverb that says, "a man that has no history has no future," that we have to be careful with history as well.  You break it down history, whose story?  You've gotta find your own story.  We've gotta find our story and it's, it's the search.  It's the hunt.  It's the connecting of the dots.  That's why history is important because the dots have been fractured as we've been taught in our early educational experiences history is--even if you look at the Bible and the Bible was interpreted a certain way.  By whom, we don't know.  It was interpreted a certain way.  So, history is very, very important.  I love it.
Story_ID: 179143
Speaker 1: Do you have any hopes moving forward for the black community, for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah absolutely.
Speaker 1: What are they?
Speaker 2: Well, my hope, my hope is that this generation that is following us will sooner or later get it, and when they do get it, I think they will be much stronger and have more ability to move the agenda forward because they have the agility ability and they have the, the intellect and they have the experiences and they have the wherewithal and they have the financial resources and they know how to get things done.  So, yeah we have, I do have hopes.  I hope, my biggest hope is that I see it before I die, but I do have hope.  No question about it.
Story_ID: 179144
Speaker 1: What would you like for your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well, legacy, I'd like to think that I've done a lot with very little.  I've done a lot with a little and if others can learn from that example I think I'd be happy with that.  I wouldn't know about it, talking about a legacy, you're talking after that fact I would know except that I'd be, I wouldn't be looking down and neither will I be looking up, I'll be right next to you, you see, so I think I'd like to see--you know when you talk to, to kids and the students there may be one thing that you might say that might change that kid's life and you may never know about it.  I have had experience of people coming up to me and tapping me on the shoulder and say you don't remember me I'm so and so and so and so and you said so and so and so and so.  Now I forget what I said, but this kid remembered that just like I remembered what [HM] Ossie Davis said to me and it made a difference to me and whatever it was that I said to this kid and it's been more than one that's done it, whatever it was that I said apparently it was important enough for this kid to be able to take it in a direction one way or the other.
Speaker 1: So, how much time do we have on this tape, are we good?  Two minutes, two minutes, good place.  What did Ossie mean exactly in your interpretation of what he said to you, what did that mean?
Speaker 2: Well, what he meant to me as I, as I, as I think back at it and as he and I have talked over the years very simply the struggle still continues.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: You're welcome.
