Speaker 1: Okay.  Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions we always ask and they just require a short answer.  The first one is ma'am, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: French bread.  I love French bread.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I love practically any kind of vegetable, and seafood.  That's my favorite.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I really like a certain shade of blue.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Any time I'm happy is my favorite time of the year.  But this last Christmas I think topped it all.  I had a beautiful, beautiful Christmas with family.  The young people in our family hired limousines, carried us downtown, actually 600 north on Michigan, to have food, have dinner.  And we had drew names Thanksgiving so that you wouldn't feel bad about not having a gift for everyone.  You only had to buy one gift, and the others were up to you.  And we had your name, so we shared our gifts.  We had food, enjoyed one another, fellowship like with one another.  And we had from age five weeks to eighty-one.  And it was a very, very enjoyable gathering.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I have one that I dream about a lot, that's Hawaii.
Speaker 1: So one day you'll go I guess.
Speaker 2: Yes, I plan to go.
Speaker 1: All right.  And the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Not that I can think of right now.  I'll think of it after you leave.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 192528
Speaker 1: Well I'm gonna ask you about your family history, as much as you know about, you know your, your mother's and your father's sides of the family.  I'm gonna ask you about your mother's side, and then I'll ask you about your father's side.  But I'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Well, her name was Mettie Johnson, M-E-T-T-I-E, J-O-H-N-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I--my mother passed when I was two and I really didn't get a chance--old enough to talk to her about these things.  I don't really know.  But I think she was around early forties.
Speaker 1: Okay, when she passed, okay.  So she may, may have been born around the turn of the century I guess, around 1900 or so.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where, where was she born?
Speaker 2: In Vernon, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now what do you know about her side of the family?  Do you know very much about her people and where they came from and--
Speaker 2: No, except that I know that she had two sisters and one brother.  And her mother passed away when she was--when, when the kids were young.  She being the oldest, sort of raised the other--the two sisters and the brother.  But I don't know of anything more about her family.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's no stories a--from that side of the family that, that they passed down about anything that happened to them?
Speaker 2: No.  It probably was but I was--I could never find anything about.
Speaker 1: Do you know how they--she got to West Point, Mississippi you know, from Vernon, Alabama?
Speaker 2: Well I think when she met her husband [George Darnell], he moved her there, to West Point.
Story_ID: 192529
Speaker 1: Well can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: G-E-O-R-G-E, D-A-R-N-E-L-L.
Speaker 1: George Daniels?
Speaker 2: Darnell.
Speaker 1: Darnell, okay, sorry.  Okay, and what's his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, I, I don't really know.  Because see when I was old enough, I used--we all would ask him how--you know he'd say today's my birthday.  We go, well how old are you?  You know how kids are, they wanna know.  Three times seven.  He stayed three times seven all the while I was growing up, so he never would tell us his age.  I find since I been, you know grown, it was a case that I knew about this young woman kept telling me 'bout her aunt.  She said she won't tell anybody her age.  And I don't know I figured this out, but it just dawned on me she doesn't know her age.  It's not that--but she got you thinking well you know I'm just not gonna tell you, you know but she doesn't really know.  And I think that was his case, I really do--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --what, you know what age he was.
Speaker 1: You think he's about the same age as your mother?
Speaker 2: I think older.
Speaker 1: Older, okay.
Speaker 2: I think like maybe four or five years older.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Than she.
Speaker 1: So he was probably born in 1890s I guess.
Speaker 2: Someplace, somewhere like that.
Speaker 1: Did you know where he was born?
Speaker 2: I think he was born in Alabama also.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right now do you know much about your father's side of the family, where they came from or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: If they were--had, had, had his ancestors been in slavery or--
Speaker 2: No.  That I would have remembered had anyone mentioned that.  They lived as farmers; that was sort of like slavery but on the books you was not a slave.  But in action, you were.
Speaker 1: So they were sharecroppers, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they say they freed the slaves.  They didn't really--when you work a man all his life and you take whatever there is that he make, then you free him with empty hands even though he's worked all his life.  How is that freeing someone?  That has always bothered me 'bout, you know who freed the slaves.  The fact of the matter is they were not free.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact they was in a worse shape because at least they could eat because they was raising they crops and all that.  They could eat and they knew they had to let 'em eat because they couldn't eat if they didn't.  But the thing about it is when you freed 'em, you didn't give 'em anything.  You wouldn't have been giving it, you'd have been letting them have what they actually earned from their own sweat.  So how, how would you call that you freed someone?
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay so did your father--did, did your father ever talk about growing up himself and what life was like for, for him when he came up?
Speaker 2: No, not--I, I was like one of the smallest in the house.  He may have talked to the older kids.  I had sisters, for an example, give you a rough idea.  My oldest sister's oldest child was older than I was.  In fact I--her youngest child and I are the same age.  So I was late arrived in there.  You know so--and he may have talked to them, but I--he, he didn't take up a lot of time talking to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did--now he moved from Alabama to Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And is there any story attached to that as to why he moved from Al--Alabama to Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Well I think during--from what I can figure out, I don't really know, that during that time, people went where they could make a better living for the family.  And if, if this guy where he moved to was--he could get he thought a little more than he was making where he was, so he would move to that next farm, you know and farm there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in sharecropping, sharecroppers had a chance to move you know, at least to a better place if they could find one?
Speaker 2: Yes, if they didn't owe--if the guy that they was living with and working for, didn't do some chopped up charges that he owed him.  You know like the crop you made didn't take care of your food and whatever he got from him.  And then he would--they would hold 'em there that way.  Now that wasn't true about you know owe--the owing part, but that's the way, that's the way they did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 192530
Speaker 1: How many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: I had six sisters and four brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Only have one sister now.  They all passed away, no brothers.
Speaker 1: So it's ten all together.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And were you--are you the youngest of that group?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your oldest sister was how many years older than you?
Speaker 2: If I make no mistake, I think she was around twenty-five, twenty or twenty-five, 'bout twenty-five I guess.
Story_ID: 192531
Speaker 1: What is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I think, even though I've been told I don't remember this, but I think I know what I remember.  My mother [Mettie Johnson] passed sudden--I mean she hadn't been sick.  And she passed like in the night.  And that following morning, undoubtedly being a little brat, I was two, I must have got out of my bed and go in her room and play with her in the morning.  I think that must have been my little routine.  Well that particular morning, they--her body was still there, but I didn't understand death and I, you know when you say my mother died, I didn't know what you was talking about, you know.  But anyway I went--I remember playing with her arm and a grown person whom I never could remember who, picked me up and carried out of the room.  And they were out there trying to explain to me about death, you know.  They was sitting on the porch and they was saying that my mother was dead and, and she's gone away.  I wanted to know when she's coming back.  And they told me that she wouldn't be back, that they was going to bury her and they--but they seemed to have second thought that I wouldn't know what they was talkin' 'bout, burying.  So they--they gonna put her in the ground.  And I remember just--I got such a lift.  I said, "They put her out there in the yard, I could go out there and play with her."  And they told me, "No you can't play with her, they not gonna put her in the yard and you can't play with her."  But that's a child's way of thinking, you know.  But that's the earliest that I can remember any, anything.  But as I--before I was old enough like to go to school or anything, I remember praying.  I remember praying.  Someone told me and I can remember a lot of things that happened to me when I was small, you know like different people, you know grownups and older kids, you know.  But I cannot remember this person, I don't know who it was that told me about God.  Undoubtedly I was very sad 'cause they told me that even if nobody loves you, God loves you.  And they went on and on explaining about God.  That stuck in my mind.  And one day I got angry because I, I must have been spanked about something.  And I left out of the house and I went out on the lawn and I remember looking up in the sky and it was beautiful blue sky.  And I prayed to God to come and get me and I told him these people down here is mean, you come and get me.  'Cause I had been told that he love me, see.  So I wanted him to come and get me.  But this is the type of things that I, you know that sticks out in my mind about when I was very small.
Story_ID: 192532
Speaker 1: Now did you grow up in West Point [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: No, I--they moved from West Point while I was yet a baby.  And I don't remember West Point except since I been grown, I've gone back and they've shown me around.  But I grew up in Cal--partially, up until I was about eight or ten, in Caledonia, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: C-A-L-E-N-D-I-A, D-O-I [sic], I believe.
Speaker 1: Caledonia, okay, okay.  Now did, did your parents [Mettie Johnson and George Darnell] have a chance to go to school much when they, when they were coming along?  Did they--
Speaker 2: I--they, they must have because I, I remember my father's handwriting.  His penmanship was I thought was nice.  So I know he had to have gone to school and it's possibly that my mother did too.  But like I wouldn't have seen her handwriting.  But I think they went to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Their parents sent 'em to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 192533
Speaker 1: So well tell me about growing up in that--in your household and in the community.  How many people were in your household when you were growing up in Caledonia [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Not, not very many because see the older kids were all out when I was born, you know married or, or if they were boys, they just like boys leave home at, at a certain age, you know.  And it was just the sister next to me, it was two, four, it was about five people or six people living in, in the house there because all the others were--all the other kids were out, you know and grown and gone out.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was you, your, your father [George Darnell] basically, and--
Speaker 2: Stepmother.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he remarried.
Speaker 2: Yes he remarried.  You know I think about that a lot, about her.  You know I try to put myself in her place.  She had some nerve marrying somebody with that many kids, you know.  And like my older--well not the oldest one, but I mean the ones over me, I don't think they were nice or, or you know what I mean like.  Well you know how kids are.  You're not my mother, you know.  They knew that she wasn't their mother.  And I think, I think she was young compared to him she was young.  And that made her closer to the kids, you know the older kids.  Well just my sister one next to me and myself were the--like the little kids in the house, you know.
Speaker 1: So did, did your stepmother raise you basically?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I stayed with her like I guess till I was about--from about two to eight or seven or eight.  And then one of my older sisters, I would live with her.  And then from then on I lived from sister--you know one of the older sisters.  I went to one older sister's there and then the oldest one, I lived with her for about two or three years.  Then the same sister--twins in the family, and one of the girls that were home when I was small, was one of the twins and her, you know her twin brother.  And she--I loved staying with her, and I loved staying with the one--next oldest one.  But I didn't like staying with my oldest sister.  And then the one that had kids older than I was, had a child older than--I didn't like staying with her.  She was, well kind of rough on children.  Then the one next to her lived in Indiana.  I was looking at something the other day that I understand that the one that lived in Indiana married the year I was born.  So I finally got to her when I became a teenager, and I liked living with her.  She was, you know, different--
Story_ID: 192534
Speaker 1: We all--during my childhood, the parents were in charge at all times.  If they said go, you go.  If you--if they say stay, you stayed.  And if you said--if they said stop, you stop now, not after while.  And if they say get up and take out the trash, you didn't wait till I finish doing whatever I'm doing, then I'll take the trash.  When they say take out the trash, they didn't tell you but once, and you took out the trash.  Because if you try it, the first time you try it, well I was--wait till I get through doing this, you know and then I'll take it out.  You'd learn from that experience not to take that time anymore.  You took the trash out.  You know you just--you were obedient during my childhood; that was the way it was.  And if they found that some of the other--your little friends, you know, didn't toe the line with their parent, you couldn't play with 'em.  You know unlike today, people will say, "He just got out there and got with the wrong crowd."  Well see it's your business to see that he don't get with the wrong crowd.  Now they'll say, "Well how do you do that?  You can't go--be with them every second.  How did they do that?"  How did my parents do that or my guardians."  You know they, they were on the case at all times.  But you know people nowadays got excuses you know why they don't raise their children properly.  And then they always say I don't know what happened, that boy--I gave him everything.  Maybe that's what's wrong with him; let him earn it.  You know you can give him a job at home, you know, and let him earn the money.  But you know people don't see it that way; they don't take the time to raise children now.  You know I, I was angry with 'em during the time when they--I'd get a spanking.  I would be mad, or they'd, you know, make you do this or that.  I was just as angry as any other kid.  But since I been--become an adult and look around me at what we got for children now, and I just look at the parents and wonder Lord, have mercy on you 'cause you gonna need mercy.  You know it's, it's, it's sad, it's really sad.  And you know every time I read in the papers about something happen to this baby or that little, little bitty little kid, something ugly happened to 'em.  I notice when I'm out, just for an example.  Lot a time I'm in line at the bank.  And a young woman will come in with a little kid holding him by the hand.  And then she go to the window to be waited on.  She never look back, never look down to see that--whether that kid is still there or not.  And sometime it's a little toddler.  They just--they get involved in their business you know, whatever the business transaction, and they done forgot the kid is there.  And then when it--when they finish and they look around, the child done disappeared.  I'm devilish at times.  I be watching the kid because I--if I thought the kid was gonna actually get hurt, into something, I would go and get it whether she got angry with you or not, 'cause some people do.  But anyway, I, I would watch and I, and I stand there with my arm folded watch her go crazy looking for that kid and I know where he is.  I've trying without her knowing, teach her a lesson.  You supposed to--you have to watch these little fellas.  They're curious because they're new here.  They--even--they see things, they don't know what it is.  To us we take it for granted because we been here a long time.  But the thing--this little child is gonna go and find out what, what, what's going on.  So they'll run off, you know.  They don't think of danger, they don't know danger.  So they'll go and investigate whatever it is that they, that they thought was interesting.  To them it's interesting.
Story_ID: 192535
Speaker 1: When I was coming up, we had somebody watching us all times.  Somebody--it didn't have to be your parents or guardian.  It could be the lady next door or down the street.  They would say--come and say to us and we were doing something or, or keeping up a lot of noise, and like gonna get into a fight or something.  See those parents felt free to come out and say now you know your mother don't allow that.  I want you to go back down there to your house and tell her I sent you down there.  Well see if a lady did that today, those parents down there would come back and beat her up.  You, you don't believe that, do you?  I, I was at work one day and I happened to be coming through the lobby where I work.  And there was a revolving door and then there was a regular door on the side.  And there were two little kids in the revolving door, going--pushing it round and round, and they were little kids.  I had seen a child foot get caught up under that hard rubber thing.  And that--and it was horrible--had to take him to the hospital.  So whenever I see a child I think might, you know be going to get hurt, I say "don't, don't do that baby, you're gonna--you may catch your foot and it'll break it".  You know, and it will.  The mother heard me, she came up there.  "You don't listen to anybody but me.  And if you wanna play in the door, go head play in the door.  And you, and, and you don't have to be yelling at my kid.  These are my kids", you know.  She told me what she felt, you know.  But I thought to myself if she get hurt, if the children get hurt, and she gonna try to sue.  I know she gonna sue.  Then I'm gonna be--I'm gonna be a witness.  I'm definitely gonna testify, I'm gonna tell the holy truth when, when I get down there.  I'm gonna tell it just like it is.  They didn't get hurt, but you know that's the way people are nowadays.  In other words, you heard, I believe it was Mrs. [Hillary] Clinton said it take the whole village to raise a child.  Well I know what she meant when she said that.  What, what--she didn't mean everybody had to get up and feed the kids and wash for 'em or nothing like that.  She meant that if I were living here with children and you live down the street and you have children, you should be able when you see my child into something that you know I don't allow, to speak to that child and then send him home and like you say, tell him that you, you told 'em not to do whatever it was that they were doing.
Speaker 2: You, you think it's better that people look out for each other.
Speaker 1: Yes, that's the only way you gonna make it.  That's how--see how that's the gangs got started.  People are not following up on who the children's friends are.  And then they have no curfew.  And I've heard people say that old boy didn't come in here till 12:00 last night, and here he fifteen years old, or fourteen.  See now those parents--you would not have did that but once.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Coming in that late.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You just come in one time 'cause you wouldn't--
Story_ID: 192536
Speaker 1: I wanna ask you about your own childhood.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well I, I enjoyed, believe it or not, like Christmas and Thanksgiving.  Now I'm not talkin' about the festivities that you're finally gonna get involved in.  You know the smell of the house.  For an example, they would have fruit--could buy--I mean get fruit and put it in bowls and set it on the table and it would just smell the whole house up.  Smell like you just--it was just beautiful.  And then when they start making pies and cakes and that aroma stays with me.  Sometime--and I, I always loved hot bread and butter.  I forgot to tell you that.  But anyway, when I'd smell the bread, the butter would automatically come into mind.  I loved butter when I was coming up.  I--so the--all these aromas I think that you--that they have in the house, was just beautiful.  And I can buy fruit here, I better not set it on the table.  Not only will it spoil in a couple of days or less, it doesn't have any nice smell to it.  You could--I can't walk in that door and smell a bowl of fruit I got sitting on--I don't smell that.  You don't smell it anymore.  But it used to--you go get the fruit and put it on the dining room table.
Speaker 1: What kind of fruit would you have?
Speaker 2: Any kind, like apples, oranges, peaches and you know when they were in season, pears, grapes, whatever.  You know it was--they were just delicious and they smell good and they didn't spoil like they do now.  I have fruit that actually spoil in the refrigerator.  I refrigerated it, better get it out of there fast 'cause it's gonna spoil.
Story_ID: 192537
Speaker 1: My sister next to me, she's only two years older than I am.  We, we was best friends (unclear) coming up.  I thought she was nice when I look back to me, as her little sister, you know.  I was thin, well I stayed thin up until two years ago.  I was thin and she was a little plump, but not fat, but a little plump.  And I was her little sister and we would hold hands.  I remember we holding hands all the time.  And we lived in a place where there was snakes.  And we went out to gather some peas for dinner, you know fresh peas.  And a snake bit her.  And I was--we didn't--we saw a snake, so we just went around, you know, but the snake probably had already bit her when we saw him, you know, because of the vines and things running, we couldn't see him good.  And when we started back home, we was carrying this--I don't remember a basket I guess, she holding one side and I'm the other.  And we goin' back home.  And I was looking at, as I say she was a little bit plump.  And one of her legs was getting bigger than the other one and I'm looking and I say one of your legs is getting fat.  She said a snake must have bit me.  Then boy, we start running, which made it worse 'cause that made the blood flow fast--and we got home and they took care of it.  And they questioned us about did we see a snake, if so, what it look like, how long, how big and so on.  And we told 'em, so they found it was not one of those real poisonous snakes.  It's poison, but not like a rattler, you know that would kill you, you know.  Well they--this was called a green snake.  It was green.  And he wasn't that poison.  You gonna swell and all that, and you have to be treated, but it wasn't gonna kill you.  So they took of, of that.  Things like--little things like that I remember.  And I notice she doesn't remember a lot of the things that I remember, or she got 'em fouled up.  If it was me, she said it was her, you know, that type.  I don't say nothing.  At first I was getting angry.  But then I, I stopped and I say I'm not gonna say anything, you know, anymore when she do that.  She does it quite often.  And then I, I--well then in our house we used to have sing-alongs.  The big kids you know would start singing and we would, we'd join in.  Start singing right with them.  And we--we used to sing Christmas carols in our house.  It was a lot of fun sometime.  But like any family, it wasn't fun sometimes, you know.
Story_ID: 192538
Speaker 1: I had pneumonia when I was about--remember I told you I was out praying asking God to take--come and get me because I was, you know I thought these people down here was mean?  Well in that same year, I was--I had double pneumonia and I went into a coma.  And I stayed I think three days.  The doctor had told them that first night that they found out I was ill, that I would not last until morning.  And of course he packed his little bag and went home or wherever.  But the--my stepmother and I don't know how they got people 'cause people didn't have--they didn't have any phones.  But they gathered together these older women, gathered together and did their home remedies on me.  And held me in their laps and wrapped in something to bring the fever down, they knew what to use.  And that's why I'm here today, other than the fact that Lord himself laid it on their minds as to what to do to save me.  But the doctor had given me over, you know.  He said there was no need of him doing anything because I was dying and I wouldn't last until morning.  But I overcame that, I had to learn to walk again.  And they had to feed me; I couldn't eat.  You know I didn't want anything to eat.  But they kept, just kept going, doing whatever they could do until they got me, you know, back 'round where I was eating and, and naturally if I eat I could regain my strength, you know.  And they just worked with me until I--okay.  But that was the only real terrible sickness I remember.  I had the regular childhood diseases, the mumps, the measles, the hoopin' cough, I had all of that.  But they knew how to handle that, those people did then.  And normally they don't run--they didn't run to the doctor every time you sneeze or something.  They knew how to take care of it themselves.  But it, it was, it was nice.  You see one of the things we had that I think is lacking today, is that we had love.  You see all the children in the house, you know the older ones took care of the little fellas.  And you looked up to 'em because they were--you know they were good to you.  They'd see that you had whatever it was you needed, and they'd carry you places.  I remember riding horses.  They was--set me up on a horse and look--I thought I was sitting on a mountain.  But you know a little kid sittin' up on a big old horse.  They set me up on a horse and, and they, and they would send the horse home with me.  And I'd sit there.  I wasn't, you know I wasn't afraid 'cause you know why, 'cause my brother put me up there.  I figure well he know what he doing, not gonna hurt me.  And I, I just enjoy, I enjoyed that.  But I could remember my little legs was so short, they didn't hardly stretch across the--you know how you sit cross on a horse and your legs down.  Well my little legs was straight out because they was so short.  I was a little--sit up there on a horse and hold on to--he walk with me.  That was dangerous, but they did it and got away with it.  But people weren't mean like they are now.

Speaker 1: And your, your, your brothers and sisters were very important I guess when you were growing up I guess the way you describe them.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  I really never dreamed that I would--they would leave before I--you know, would pass away before I did.  Now that was a silly thought, but maybe it was what you call wishful thinking, you know.  But I was very--I, I, I just--the idea that I'm going to one house was fine; I enjoyed that.  But I had to get grown and learn that everybody have a life of their own to live.
Story_ID: 192540
Speaker 1: What, what kind of little girl were you growing up?  Were you, were, were you happy you think for the most part, or did you--
Speaker 2: Yeah I think for the most part, I loved to dance and sing.  And I used to be in a lot of plays at school.  I, I, I loved that, I enjoyed that very much.
Speaker 1: Now what, what, what was the name of your school?  What school did you go to?
Speaker 2: Okay, the first school I can remember was (unclear), some kind of Spring--Cola Springs I think they called it.
Speaker 1: Cole Springs?
Speaker 2: Cola, like as in Pepsi Cola, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Cola Springs, went there, I don't know, a few years and then I went to Cedar Grove I believe was the name of the next school.  And then there was a, a private school in Vernon, Alabama called Lamont, Lamont County Training School [ph.].  It was run by two sisters, the Todd [ph.] sisters, Zeffrie [ph.] was the principal, and her sister Ruby [ph.] was the assistant principal.  And, and the--you know the, the demanding obedience at that school was at home.  But you know I, I was sort of a big girl then.  I was about seventh or eighth grade.  And--but they, they were real strict, but they were interested not only in the three R's, but in the person, you know the individual.  And they took time and talked with you and explain life, you know 'cause you, even though you may be ever so smart academically speaking, but if you don't know how to live everyday life, that academic learning really is not gonna do you that much good.  It may help you to make more money, but your happiness, your wellbeing doesn't come through, it doesn't know how.  But the--Zeffrie, that was the principal I used to laugh, you know she didn't know I was laughing.  She used to get--excuse all the boys out of our class and just keep the girls in and she would march up and down that center aisle up to the--from the teacher's desk back to the back.  She'd be walking and talking to the girls about girls, you know.  And she always wore a skirt and a top.  And she'd stick her thumbs down in the skirt waist, and I always thought she strutted like a turkey.  I didn't know I was gonna be fat one day; she was kind of big.  I used to sit back there and be thinking these things and laughing to myself.  And when she turn back around and make a, you know, back down the aisle, I had a straight face, you know.  I knew better.  But anyway, she would be saying things like you know, how to act, how to carry yourself and, and so on and so on.  But she--and she would say and while you're here, you are going to act like a lady whether you are one or not.  And you know--yeah she wore her glasses down here.  And she would be going--we--I enjoyed the school.  And when I look back on it, it was one of the best schools I've ever gone to because they, they don't--at school nowadays they can't have the rules and the regulations and enforce 'em like they did when I was going to school because they (unclear).
Speaker 1: Now were they--now how many--did they have like one school room or did they have like a--
Speaker 2: No, this was--
Speaker 1: Was it a bigger place?
Speaker 2: I don't remember how many rooms right now.  We had the lower level, that was only one room.  That was the, the what you call 'em room--I can't even--but upstairs was like we had a--like the eighth grade class had our own room.  I know the twelfth grade was right over from us.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was a pretty big school.
Speaker 2: Yeah it was pretty good--
Speaker 1: How many students were, were in the school do you think?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  And they had a dormitory right across the street from where we went to school.
Speaker 1: Now did you stay in the, in the--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See they had buses.  The kids that, you know wanted to, could ride the bus.  But there were kids farther away where there wasn't any bus.  Those kids lived in dormitories.  Or they lived with private families.  You know it was like--well see when I was going to school you could meet these people and sort of judge whether you wanna leave your kid with 'em or not, you know.  And this is how they did it.  But you never heard of anything happening to any of the children that lived in the private homes or lived in the dorm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The teachers lived in the dorms 'cause they weren't--I don't think from around there.  They lived in the dorm and there were kids that lived there and there were kids that lived in private homes around there, you know.
Story_ID: 192541
Speaker 1: This is about 1940--let's see, you were thirteen, so it's like 1947.
Speaker 2: Somewhere around there, in there.  It--but I enjoyed the--that school because you--we had to wear a uniform, sky blue dresses, white cuffs and white collars, that was our color.  We had to wear that every day.  That was good because you didn't have a lot of money to be buying, you know sweaters and skirts and different, you know like young kids like to dress.  If you have to wear a uniform, then you wasn't embarrassed, you know you was dressed like everybody else.  So that is one thing that is--I thought was good.  But you have parents, and I would, wouldn't allow their kids to be today--they holler about everything.  But anyway I'm glad I was a child when I was child, and that I'm not one now.  Now I'd like to feel good, you know like then and have all that energy and, and everything.  But--and not looking old and tired.  But I still think I came up at a very good time, era in this country where people was--parents was still parents.  They wasn't your buddy, they were parents and they were tough.  But they made men and women out of 'em.  You know I, I don't know of but one boy that I've met since we've been grown that has spent time in jail.  It's probably nobody in certain areas here that haven't been in jail for something.  But they didn't go to jail.
Speaker 1: Now were you a good student in school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: I was very good, believe it or not, I don't sound like it, but I was very good--my favorite subject was English literature.  I loved that and I was good in it.  I did pretty good in like in history.  I did all right in everything except math.  Math crowded my brain.  I don't mean the simple math, I mean you know when you move on up.  I didn't get it; I just didn't get it.  I thought my sister next to me, I thought she was smart, you know.  But I was not smart in school, but I did, I did all right in most subjects except that one.  And I did so poorly in that, that that sort of held a cloud over the ones I did do well.  I didn't--I just--math, we did not get along.
Story_ID: 192542
Speaker 1: Now, now where did you go up after Lamont School, did you--
Speaker 2: Lamont County Training School [Vernon, Alabama]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's when I moved to Indiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To Gary [Indiana] with my second oldest sister.  She has a daughter close--she and I are close in age.  As I said, she's the one that married the year I was born.  So her first child is--
Speaker 1: Now were you excited about going to Gary?  Or did--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See I didn't know her.  As I say, well when--I didn't tell you she left, but when she got married when I was born.  She went to--she and her husband moved to Indiana then, to Gary.  So I was growing up while she was here raising her children.  I had never lived with her.  I had never been around her.  And you know we had to be very mannerable when we were coming up, and I remember my oldest sister telling me not to say "yes ma'am" and "no ma'am" to her.  She said I'm your sister and you're not supposed to say "yes ma'am" and "no ma'am" to me, see you can say "yes" and "no" to me.  And I didn't say this to her, but I was thinking I don't trust you.  I had these thought, these silly thoughts, you know.  Lord know I (unclear) but I--you know a lot of things that they did was wrong, you know, in a sense.  Yet I knew better than to complain too.
Speaker 1: What do you mean a lot of things they did, they did were wrong?  I mean why would they--
Speaker 2: I don't mean they deliberately abused us or anything like that, it's just some of the things they didn't allow us to do or they insisted that we do, you know just chores and things such as that.  I thought--I still think when I look back that they were wrong, but after looking at the kids of today, that little wrong didn't hurt too bad.  You know, really didn't.
Story_ID: 192543
Speaker 1: So I lived in Indiana.
Speaker 2: Now did you go to--you--did you go to high school in Indiana?
Speaker 1: No, I went to high school here [Chicago, Illinois], right out there.  I had to go back after--because I didn't have my degree, I mean my diploma from there.  And I needed credit, so I went out here and took 'em, got 'em.
Speaker 2: I mean so did you go to school in Gary [Indiana]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I went to Roosevelt [High School, Gary, Indiana].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Roosevelt was a school that started at kindergarten and all the way through 12th grade.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is in Gary?  Okay.
Speaker 1: And I, I went there with my nieces, my sister's oldest daughter, second oldest and a son.  I went, I went there.
Speaker 2: How did you like Roosevelt?
Speaker 1: Well I'm not--I wasn't in love with it.  I didn't particularly like that.  I ran into a teacher there, a Mrs. MacMickens [ph.].  Mrs. MacMickens was a young woman, teacher I guess probably around thirty, late twenties or early thirties.  She was wearing a natural.  Now you know when naturals came in.  They did not come in when I was a kid in school.
Speaker 2: So this was about 1948, '49 [1949].
Speaker 1: Yeah.  She had on, she had a natural and she was--wasn't too bright either.  She decided to make a symbol, a negative symbol of me only because I was--see I--this is what I found, I learned through the years, not just in Gary but in the South.  Teachers, black teachers if you was light and had nice hair, you was the teacher's pet, you would get away with anything.  But if you weren't, lo and behold, you had to walk--you gonna almost go to the cross, I'm telling you.  But--so I ran into one, Mrs. MacMickens was one.  She got up and--
Speaker 2: Was, was she light herself?
Speaker 1: No.  I don't--I'm not sure she was even my color.  Face was darker, you know.  But it wasn't her looks or color that bothered me.  It was her attitude.  She was talking about people from the South, and she made me stand up and walk up, you know to her desk and back.  "Now see people from the South, they are ignorant," and she went on, this was a teacher.  So the young boy sitting in--I think I was the tallest girl in the class and he was the tallest boy in the class.  He was sitting in back of me at the last seat on the wall on the back, and her desk is up here.  And see like I say we didn't talk back to teachers and adults and things when we come here.  Okay, Marion Brown [ph.] was his name.  Now ask me how I remember that name and can't remember so long people's name.  But see Marion did a brilliant thing.  And he took a chance on getting thrown out of school.  But he--she--he stood up.  He said, "Ms. MacMickens," he say, "You have to excuse me," he said, "but I'm not gonna sit here any longer and see you make fun of that girl."  He say, "You leave her alone."  He say, "You supposed to be an example for us and teaching us and you sitting up there making fun of one of the children here in the--in your class."  He said, "Now if you wanna take me to the principal's office."  Now see normally if you did anything like that, that's where you gonna end up, in the principal's office.  Then your parents gonna be called.  Okay.  Do you know that woman dropped her head, didn't say another word, and haven't carried him to the principal's office yet.  She knew she was wrong.
Speaker 2: Now that's interesting.  That's an interesting story.
Speaker 1: He really spoke out.
Speaker 2: Do you know what happened to Marion Brown later?
Speaker 1: No, I never--after school I, I wanted--I often think about him, and I, I wonder, I say I hope--I bet he made a fine young man, you know, like when he got grown, you know and had children.  I--and he would be fair with his kids.
Story_ID: 192544
Speaker 1: You know how some people have favorites?  I don't like that either.  I've seen that.  That's ugly and that backfires in your face when you--like a person got more than one child.  But he got one over here he, he caters to.  And he brags on.  And see that hurts these other children, or this other child.  No parent should be caught doing that.  If you find yourself talking a little too much about little Johnny, get, get him, get the other one over there and talk about him sometime.  Give 'em a special trip with you to something that you know he would like.  But don't ever make difference in children.  You only hurt yourself.  And every time I have noticed this happening and witnessed this, that child that, that your--that special child usually embarrass you af--you know later on in life.  And if you don't watch him close, you--that's the one that's gonna beat your--that one that you spoiled and pet and brag on.  I've got two friends.  One of 'em is not calling me now because she found out something about her grandson that made her--it would have hurt any parent.  But she used to brag on him all the time.  She said nothing 'bout--if she said anything about the little--his little sister, it was negative.  She bragged on this child all the time and here lately she found out something that she didn't want, you know, to accept.  And I, and I talked to her, she never mentioned it to me.  Somebody else told me.  And I just said things like when God loan us these children, he loan 'em to us to nurture and to like to care for and love and to educate too.  I said but he didn't get--send you a guarantee how they're gonna turn out, whether they gonna stand up and be a man or they'll go the other way, or the young lady, you don't know.  And we have no guarantee.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You just do your job; that's all you can do.
Story_ID: 192545
Speaker 1: How long did you live in Gary [Indiana]?  I mean how many--
Speaker 2: I lived there from teen, kind early teen or middle teens up until about '49 [1949].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: And then I, I moved over here [Chicago, Illinois] and--
Speaker 1: So you didn't, you didn't finish high school when you--when you were a teenager.
Speaker 2: Over there.  No, I finished here.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And I went a little while to Triton [College, River Grove, Illinois], not long.  I didn't get, I didn't get a degree.  I went to Triton for a while.  And I lived on Washington and then--and I'm--we bought a home on Lexington [Street] in Chicago [Illinois].
Story_ID: 192546
Speaker 1: So you were at--how, how, how long did you go to Ga--Roosevelt High School in Gary [Indiana]?
Speaker 2: If I made a mistake, I think I went there about two or three years.  I don't, I don't remember now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It wasn't no bad experience, but my niece, the one that, you know, almost old as I was, my sister's daughter, was going to--all her kids was--she had three there, they was going to the same school 'cause I as I say they, they went from kindergarten to twelve, through to twelfth grade at that one school, and it was a huge place.  And she was a little bit ashamed of me.  She had the same ideas and--that this teacher, that Ms. MacMickens [ph.] had.  You from the South, so that makes you stupid.  You--I mean you think I'm just saying that.  They, they made you feel--and then when you a child, you don't know how to overcome these type things.  And so the way I found it out, one of her friends named Laura [ph.], Laura said one day, she spoke to me and I, and I--you know, responded.  And she say she out there talkin' 'bout her, she got more manners than Kathy [ph.] have.  And I thought--talkin' 'bout she's country.  Kathy said she's country.  And she had more--she had more manners than Katherine [ph.].  Katherine hadn't been to the school I had gone to.  You gonna act nice even if you didn't like the people, you know.  You just, you just act nice.  That's what you did.  But anyway she was--would get angry or she was a jealous person, bless her heart.  She was--would get on her mother about me living with them, you know and all that stuff.
Speaker 1: So you kind of felt kind of squeezed out.
Speaker 2: I was, I was.  But what I think gave me a whole lot of hope and trust in myself, faith in myself is that after I went through with what I had gone through with the Contract Buyers League, I faced people I never would have spoken to.  I mean people in high places--
Story_ID: 192547
Speaker 1: Now, now you met a young man [James "Ira" Wells] in high school [Roosevelt High School, Gary, Indiana], right and got married.
Speaker 2: Well I didn't meet him in school.
Speaker 1: Right, right, but while you were in there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I got married.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was--where'd you meet him?
Speaker 2: At one of my sisters' houses.  I think he was a, you know like a friend come around sometime, and that's how I met him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay so you got married, you were about what, about fifteen or sixteen?
Speaker 2: No, I, I didn't, I didn't get married like--like say I left school today and got married next month, it wasn't that, like that.  I got married--I was look like to me about twenty-one or something.
Speaker 1: That's a long time, yeah.
Speaker 2: But we, we stayed together a pretty good while before he passed.  He passed in '81 [1981].
Story_ID: 192548
Speaker 1: Did you have a job when you stopped going to school, or--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I always, I always worked.  And I had a job one time at Standard Oil in Whiting, Indiana as a teenager.  At the time, they would hire black men, but no black women.  And they had, they had a, a factory there, that's a oil refinery.  You know that.  But they had a factory there where they made candles, you know all kinds of candles, but they wouldn't hire black girls.  So the gov--they had government contracts, naturally.  And, and the government said hire the black girls or lose the money.  And they probably figured they could talk them out of some kind of way.  But they negotiated and the government stood pat.  You know they gonna take--pull the contract.  I can't make you hire, but I can do--take my work, my--you know-away.  So they, they hired, started hiring black.  But when we went there, they put the ad or somehow they let us know.  So they put the ad in the paper or something.  And we got--like a bunch of us went over there this Monday morning early, you know, going to get hired.  We got in line.  Now they didn't tell you anything about the condition of the hiring, it was just that, you know, black girls gonna be hired.  We got in line and I was like down here and the first girl in the line was probably at that door, front door.  That's, you know, long line and I'm all the way back here.  In the front of me, this woman that was sitting at this desk would do a little short interview.  And if you didn't have your high school diploma with you, not just say I got one, you had to have it with you, she turned you down.  If you had it, then you go in the back to the physical, and take a physical.  If you pass the physical, you're hired.  Okay I, I'm looking at this.  All this--I don't have a diploma, you know I told you at that point.  Walking up there and one mind said well you might as well turn around and go on back home.  You ain't got no diploma and they, they would tell the ones that they sent home.  Well if you have a diploma, bring it back, be here at 8:00 in the morning or 7:00 or something like that, bring it with you and just go on back and you know, show me the diploma and go on back, take your physical.  If you pass your physical, you got it.  In other words, they had to do something.  They could have told the girls that, you know, bring your high school diploma, but they didn't.  So when I got up there, I'm gonna tell you 'bout this Lord I believe that I serve.  I--and my mind told me well stay on up there; let her send you home.  So I stayed on in line, went on like that.  She took one look at me, she said go on back and take your physical.  She haven't asked me for a diploma yet.  Everybody in the front of me had to show a diploma or come back tomorrow.  So I know that as--we have a song we sing now, 'The Angels are Watching Over Me.'  Had to be because I'm not the light one with the little--well I had long hair but it wasn't, you know how they look, pretty hair.  I didn't have it.  So I--this was a white woman of course.  Maybe she--that didn't do anything to her, but I don't know any other reason that woman sent me for my physical.
Story_ID: 192549
Speaker 1: This is around 1948 or '49 [1949] or what do you think?
Speaker 2: I guess, yeah.
Speaker 1: Were you 'bout fifteen or, or--
Speaker 2: I was older than--
Speaker 1: Sixteen.
Speaker 2: I thought I was--I probably was sixteen.
Speaker 1: Sixteen, okay.
Speaker 2: But I was with--I could have been fifteen, could not have been before my birthday.
Speaker 1: Sixteen by 1950.
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty [1950].
Speaker 1: Was it that late?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't '50 [1950].  It was earlier than--
Speaker 1: Forty nine [1949]?
Speaker 2: It was like '48 [1948] maybe, '47 [1947], somewhere in there.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: I keep, I keep the years all mixed up now.  But I got hired at Standard Oil and learned to make candles and they had told--the white girls decided to boycott if they bring black girls in.  So when we got there--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: So they paid, I don't know what size bonus, to the few white girls that will accept it, to train the black girls.  So that's how they got the ones that were there to stay.  So when we came in and they, they train--they was training us, and one girl came in all flustered.  The one that I, you know, kind of had got to know, you know.  And I asked her, I say--you, your face is all flush.  I say what happened?  I said somebody bother you or something?  She said no.  She said I had a fight with my mother.  I said you better not be fighting with your mother.  She said you'd fight with her too if you know what we was fighting about.  I said what were you fighting about?  She said--then she told me the story about what had happened.  They were paid.  I don't mean paid for your regular work, extra bonus to, to stay there and not to walk out like the rest of the white girls.  She said a lot of white girls here and they, they all left because they heard you all was coming.  She say and they paid me and these other white girls you see 'round here, they paid us to stay here and teach you all the job.  She said and they been talking about y'all and I told 'em, I told 'em about you all were coming over and you all was this and that.  You know everything negative.  And I said well did they explain that some of us are.  But there are others, other ones that are not like that; same thing in your race.  I say in your race you got some people you don't wanna live by.  I said in my race I have some I'm not gonna live by.  I say but you know you can't put us all in one little mold and squash us together and say that's it.  Some are good, some are bad.  I said same thing with your race.  She said well I like a lot of these black girls than I do some of them white girls.  She say 'cause they nice, they funny and friendly.  She said and they ain't nothing like my mama told me they was.  I thought all y'all had like bear claws, gonna come in the way they described you.  I said well, I said that's been the thing for generations, and I said you have to learn, meet people, sort 'em out yourself.  I say you don't just push a whole group of people into one little stall and say they all belong in there; that's not--never gonna be true.  You're always gonna have nice people and you're always gonna have bad people.
Story_ID: 192550
Speaker 1: How long did you work for Standard Oil [in Whiting, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Let me see I worked there--I'm trying to think why did I leave there.  I seem to have worked there for about two years or so.  And--
Speaker 1: Were you treated pretty good there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they--you didn't have any problem.  I mean we didn't have any probl--and a lot of those girls that were paid to stay for a certain length of time, stayed.  And, let me tell you this.  Now okay I told you 'bout the black girls had to show their diploma.  We get hired and here's a girl named Stephanie; couldn't even sign her name.
Speaker 1: A white girl.
Speaker 2: She's a white girl.  She could not write, couldn't read or write.  I used to sign her paycheck every time we got paid.  See she'd initial it, you know put her little scrabble thing, little mark down there, and I would sign her name on it, on the check you know.  'Cause this is, this is--you talkin' 'bout Jim Crow there, this, this was Jim Crow, you hear me?  They--but they didn't bother us, you know at all.  I mean they--there were no callin' name calling or--there was some that didn't like each other, but that's anywhere you go.  If they all black or if they all white, it's gonna be somebody there that's not gonna get along, they just don't get along.  But that's the human race as we know it, anyway.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you don't remember why you left Standard--?
Speaker 2: No, I can't remember.  I don't know--it's a possibility I could have been laid off.  I'm not sure and I don't, I don't remember why.

Speaker 1: But you know what?  I remember working at the Y, YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] in Gary [Indiana].  That was a interesting place.  The YMCA, if you walked in the dining area, was just as clean as anything you would want to see.  Floor, they had tile or linoleum I think on the floor, and it was just glassy, looked glassy it was so clean and shiny.  Okay they had linen tablecloths on the table.  They had beautiful china, I mean and glassware and silverware.  You could--it was just--made you wanna eat maybe just to go off in there.  You wanna eat 'cause it was really beautiful.  I mean real--it wasn't fancy.  It was nice, but not real fancy, but it was clean.  And I worked there for a while and the--when they dropped--see restaurants is a big fooler.  Okay like I tell you 'bout how clean and neat and nice, inviting it was.  When you go back there in that kitchen.  The chef, he was good, but if they drop something on the floor, you didn't think it's going in the garbage; it's going in somebody's stomach.  Now that was the main level, even with the cafeteria.  You know the area, the dining area.  Then there was another kitchen downstairs in the--on the lower level.  There was a woman down there that could bake.  That woman make a pie, cake, sweet rolls, coffee cakes, what--you name it.  If it's baked, she had--I mean the woman could cook.  But if she didn't have TB (tuberculosis), I don't she had.  She would go--she, when she cough, it sound like she was torn up inside.  You heard people with that horrible cough.  And she coughed all day, cooking down there cooking and cooking.  You know you just--you learn--as I say you can learn something new every day.  And I've learned that everything that look good is not good.  And that goes for people too.  Look good, boy, but you know not necessarily good.  She would have a coughing fit down there sometime and they had a young black chef, and he could cook.  He could make a beef roast, it was really good, tasty, tender.  But you know they wanted all that clean.  They would clean.  I mean if the, the Health Department comes in every so often, you know that.  And if they came in, now you didn't see dirty dishes or dirty floor, or even a dirty stove, it was clean.  But it's the way they handled the food.  You don't know who's handling it.
Speaker 2: This is the Y in Gary.
Speaker 1: Yeah, YMCA in Gary.  But I enjoyed working there.  But eventually I left and I came on--when I moved over here [Chicago, Illinois], I got a different job, you know.  I worked in electronics.
Story_ID: 192552
Speaker 1: Now did you move here [Chicago, Illinois] before you got married or after you got married?
Speaker 2: Afterwards.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's not--that puts us about 1955.  You said you were like twenty-one when you got married.  Yeah, that's '55 [1955].  Okay so well when you moved over to Chicago, you know you lived on the West Side, right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And did, did you--where'd you live before you bought your home?
Speaker 2: On Washington Boulevard.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Twenty something, let me see (unclear), 'bout 2800, 27 or 2800 west.  It's a school there now on the south side of Washington Boulevard, 27 or 2800, and that's where the building was that I lived in.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well tell me 'bout the West Side.  What was the West Side of Chicago like then?  'Cause it--in Chicago people well known in the black community that you got like two separate black communities; you got the West Side and the South Side.  And there are a lot of different communities in each one, but the west and south side are like two different cities in some ways because there, there's a lot of separation and there's a whole lot of folklore now about what a West Sider is and what a South Sider is.  So talk about some of that.  What it was like then?
Speaker 2: Well actually I always observed that the people that lived on the South Side figured they were better than the ones that live on the West Side.  And a few people on the West Side resented that very much because for an example, we were working for a place called Sonora [Radio & Television Corp], name of radio and television, made radio and televisions.  And we got locked out the--Sonora--the money they take form your check every time you get a check, the money they was taking for taxes, federal taxes, they didn't turn 'em into the IRS [Internal Revenue Service].  So I guess they gave 'em, I don't know how much.  I don't think the government really just comes in on you like that.  They warn you that you owe and how much and so on.  And they probably ignored 'em.  But anyway, they closed, they locked the doors.  But what happened, we went to work that day and an announcement came over the intercom that everyone come to the cafeteria.  So everybody got up and went on in the cafeteria.  When we got in there, one of the guys we knew was talking.  He said that the government had closed the place and go back up front and don't touch anything except your personal belongings.  And march out the door.  And they turned the lights off.  It was in the day time, but in those factories it's dark, you know, if you don't have lights.  We had to go up there and just get a coat and march down the steps.  And when somebody come out with your coat, you know you exchange your--you give 'em the one you got and you take yours.  You know that's how we got out of there 'cause we couldn't see how to get our coats, you know.  We knew where they were.  We could go and get a coat and hopefully it's mine, you know, but when I get downstairs I'll see.  In the light it's not mine, then I'll just hold it up and whoever comes by and own the coat, they, they take it and give you the one they have, you know.  So we, we got locked out of there.  So the union was over here, the union hall that we had was over here, they told us to come and sign these papers, they was going to sue, going to court and they was gonna try to get our back pay.  The check we had cashed the week before bounced, which we didn't know they didn't have any money.  Then the, the girls--they say call the ones you know on the South Side.  Why don't you all get together and exchange who gonna call who and tell 'em to beat it over here because if they don't sign, I don't care if we get all the money or what we get, they're not gonna get it if their name is not on there, they have to sign.  So we called those girls on the south side.  I know personally three of my West Side friends call, you know we split up names, I take so many, you take so many and so on, so we could call the girls on the South Side to let them know.  And they had a deadline.  So we called 'em.  You know what they said?  "I'm not coming over to that West Side."  Well okay.  I mean all I can do is call and tell 'em, you know.  And so they didn't, they didn't come.
Story_ID: 192553
Speaker 1: So we signed, the girls over here.  And we signed and 'bout--I had got another job at 3M [Chicago, Illinois] then.  I, I--and they gave--sent me a check, part of my vacation pay, the check that bounced and part of my salary for--that they owed me after that bouncing check.  And so it was--some of the girls had got hired out there where I was working, it was on the south side by the way, 3M was.  And this one girl--I don't know, like I said the devil made me do it.  I went 'round now what--why would I take my check to work with me?  Where you get all that money?  Wasn't that much, but you know to us it was you know.  Where you get all that money?  And I told 'em, I say this is the--they settled our suit and I, I say you did come over here and--over there and sign up.  No.  I said well I called you and I told you.  And I said, I said well why didn't you come over there?  I don't know, I must have been doing--no it wasn't.  She thought she was too great to go over there, so she didn't go.  We hurt ourselves a lot, you know, but anyway she said she gonna get a lawyer.  I said look, I said I know they--I told you what they told me.  Anyone that didn't sign for them at that point, you know, they gave us a time space, like from say today up until the 30th or something like that.  I said and if you didn't go, you couldn't get any of the money and a lawyer, you know, won't do you any good.  I'm gonna get me a lawyer and I'm gonna get my money.  I says a law--I say you gonna--I say if a lawyer take your case, the understanding I have, he's, he's a crook himself.  'Cause he would know this type case I can't win nothing for you because you're too late.  You should have signed.  She went and got a lawyer anyway, you know saying probably, you know saying she don't know what she talking about.  Well I wasn't a lawyer, but I had been told by the lawyers what to do, what not to do.  And I passed that on; did the best I could.  But it didn't work.  She went and got the lawyer and wasted her money.  He knew she couldn't get any money from that company 'cause it was a class action suit.  And everybody in the class supposed to sign.  You didn't sign, that mean you let your own self out of the class; and that's the way it was.  But you know you--it's--there are people that don't believe anything certain people say.  But if you, you know if I like you, I believe what you say.  If I don't think too much of you, you know, then I, I just throw it out when you tell me something even though it's for my own good.  But that's the way we are; that's the way people are, humans (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 192554
Speaker 1: You were working at 3M [Chicago, Illinois] and were you thinking about buying a, a home at that point?  Okay.
Speaker 2: I believe I was working there when I bought the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is the late '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: When I bought the home I was working there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is in--'bout when did you start at 3M, do you, do you, do you remember?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  It was at the--
Speaker 1: Was, was it in, in, in the '60s [1960s] or late '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: I think it was '50s [1950s], I think '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because '60s [1960s] was when we were fighting for the, the contracts you know.
Speaker 1: Well I know the contract I think, from what I read I think it--your fight started around '68 [1968], yeah '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: That's the time [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was killed wasn't it?
Speaker 1: Right, yeah, yeah.  So any rate, so were you following the, the activities in the South during the Civil Rights Movement, and what did you think about what was going on down there?
Speaker 2: You mean down South?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well I thought I had a lot of different thoughts.  You know I guess you read where Huntley Brink, was it [Chet] Huntley and [David] Brinkley, that news team.  I thought it was kind of comical where the people down south said they didn't worry 'bout the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] as bad as they worried 'bout Huntley and Brinkley, I think it was Huntley and Brink--'cause you know they would go in depth on, on a story.  They would, they would dig deep and those people weren't ready to tell--to report.  They didn't want the country or the people outside of their state to know just how bad things were in there.  So--and they didn't want them there, but so they was, they were more afraid of them than they was the FBI.  So I thought that was funny, but I--you know it was a dirty fight in the sense that we always got the lickin', you know in a sense.  But I was proud of the fact that we had men and women that say even though you slap me or whatever you do to me, I'm gonna still ask for the same thing, you know what I'm asking for.  I'm gonna stand up for my rights; and they stood up even though under bad circumstances.  Some people died.  Some was--they sic dogs on some, they turned a hose on 'em.  They did all kind of ugly things to 'em.  But I always feel like--not that I'm so brave I would want--that I, I'm not sure I could have stood up under that.  But you don't really know how strong you are until you get in the fight, you really don't.  You think like just sitting back watching the news or reading the paper about what's going on.  There are times that in a fight when you're in a--some type--even if it's a verbal fight, you use words you never use.  And they'll come to you, you know, like this.  And then like I was telling you about Cahill when he was referring to me or insinuating that I drink.
Speaker 1: This was much later on.  This is in the police department.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But anyway--
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll get to that, but just, yeah, yeah so you say there's something about the fight that makes you--
Speaker 2: Gives you more determination.
Speaker 1: Meet the challenge.
Speaker 2: And if it's something you believe in up front, you know you before you--before you even started to fight, but it's something you really believe in, I think you, you get power from above.
Story_ID: 192555
Speaker 1: You said at one point in the '60s [1960s], now you were working for the [U.S.] Navy, right.  You worked for the Navy?
Speaker 2: [United States] Department of the Navy.
Speaker 1: Department of the Navy.  And you were telling us during the break that you and your husband [James "Ira" Wells] had different political views.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That he was a Republican basically and you were a Democrat I guess.
Speaker 2: He liked all the Republican presidents and I didn't.
Speaker 1: So he supported [President Richard Milhous] Nixon in 1960?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And [President John Fitzgerald] Kennedy won, right?
Speaker 2: Right, I voted for Kennedy.
Speaker 1: Was he for [Barry] Goldwater in '64 [1964]?  He ran against Johnson, [President] Lyndon [Baines] Johnson.
Speaker 2: Probably, I don't remember definitely, but I'm thinking probably so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then he was--later on he was--when Nixon won in '68 [1968], he was voting for Nixon and then [President Ronald Wilson] Reagan later on after that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know see when--before he ran against President Kennedy, I had observed the Kennedy brothers, they were having a--some kind of discussion with people that--(unclear) that was accused of doing something.  They was--they had it on TV.  And I watched how like maybe one of the boys, Kennedy boys would catch the ball and throw it to the other one.  And I just liked the way they operated, you know during this thing.  He wasn't running for no presidency at that point.  And I, I liked the way they conducted themselves.  I even liked the questions they were asking these people and the response and everything.  And I, I sort of then--from then on I stopped following them.  Before then I, I--it was kind of--some type of hearings they were involved in.  But after then I start following it.  Observing to where, you know when anything in the paper or on television about one of the Kennedys, I start, you know, following through on it.
Speaker 1: Were you, were you a fan of Hubert Humphrey in those days?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I think I didn't notice him like I did some of the other candidates, all presidents that ran for presidency.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you, were you involved at all in, in Chicago [Illinois] politics?  Did you pay attention to--
Speaker 2: No, I, I had began to you know, watch the news about politicians and the, and then reading in the papers about 'em, but I didn't, I didn't go to any rallies or anything like that.  I didn't take a part in it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who was your alderman on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] when--
Speaker 2: I didn't even know him.  I honestly have to say I didn't know him, whoever he was.
Story_ID: 192556
Speaker 1: When you and your husband [James "Ira" Wells] decided to buy a home, this was like 1967, '68 [1968] or when was it?
Speaker 2: Fifty-nine [1959].  It could have been, I think it was '59 [1959].  I don't have any papers now because they were burned.  But I think it was '59 [1959].
Speaker 1: Okay, this is when you bought your home on--
Speaker 2: Lexington.
Speaker 1: On Lexington, okay.  It was a duplex, right?
Speaker 2: Two flat.
Speaker 1: Two flat, right, brick, okay, right.  And now that--the area that you bought in was changing from white to black.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what were the--what was going on in terms of real estate and black people then?
Speaker 2: Well I didn't know it at that time, I didn't know that we couldn't get a, a mortgage, conventional mortgage.  That black people didn't get them.
Speaker 1: Okay, so black folks couldn't get a conventional mortgage then.
Speaker 2: No, they couldn't get--but I didn't know that.  But see since we all was gonna put down like a small amount, I figured it was okay you know, we get it like that.  Only way we gonna get a house, you know.  And we was tired of moving.  So we thought, well you know buy your own and move when you get ready.  I mean if you wanna sell it, okay.  But we just thought it would be better, you know, and so we bought.  And they was--we had to move from there because I told you they built a school there.  They were asking us to move because they was going to build a school.  So we--that's why we moved from over there; that's when we bought.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay so how, how much money did you have to put down on your, on your house?
Speaker 2: I think it's in that book.  I don't have that information with me; I don't remember all that stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay well it says--from what I read it was three thousand dollars.
Speaker 2: Something (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you paid like twenty-three thousand [dollars] for it I believe from what, what I read.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 192557
Speaker 1: How did you become an activist, you know simply from buying a home?
Speaker 2: Well it, it happened like this.  In the contract it stated that after we pay in a certain amount, then we could go for a conventional mortgage.  But he knew we wasn't gonna get no mortgage; we didn't.  But that was in the contract.  So I went--I told my husband [James "Ira" Wells], I say I think we should go and get a conventional mortgage.  So I said I'm gonna get me a lawyer and I don't know how I came in contact with this lawyer.  I don't remember who recommended--I certainly didn't know him.  But someone must have recommended this lawyer that I got.  And I went to him and told him my story, what I wanted to do.  And he accepted my retainer and said that he would take care of it.
Speaker 1: Now was this Mack Clinton [ph.]?  Okay, Mack Clinton, all right.
Speaker 2: I'm not positive.
Speaker 1: And he, he's a black lawyer?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's a black lawyer.  So I--after I paid, after we paid the retainer for a whole year I couldn't hear from him.  For a whole year I tried.  You know I called, leave messages.  He would never be there or return my call.  So I finally went over there one day and he was in his office.  And I asked him why he wouldn't return my call?  I said it's been a whole year, I said you haven't called me one time to say it's making progress or you're not doing anything.  I said but you haven't said a word.  And I said and you wouldn't even return my calls when I would call and leave messages for you.  Well I been out, sorry 'bout it, I been kind of busy.  Ain't nobody that busy unless they dead.  I said and then you got--you can't call.  So he--I was angry when I went in there at him.  Every time I would think about now he could have at least return a call I know.  But--and he started making excuses.  As he talked, do you know I got angrier?  I knew he was lying.  See I didn't trust him at all now because you wouldn't even--you didn't have the decency to give me a call just say you don't take--you not gonna do it or whatever.  But say something.  But he didn't.  So therefore I just was getting angry as he talked 'cause I figure everything he saying is--he's lying.  So--and then he--I was fussing with him and he said to me now Mrs. Wells, I know what you need.  And by the time he said that, I told him what I needed.  I told him I needed a lawyer.  I said I need a lawyer, that's what I need.  In other words I was saying you are not a lawyer, you know, because of the way you act, your conduct says you're not a lawyer.  And so and I asked for my money back.  So he got--had the girl to bring a check in and gave me my money back.  And then he said something 'bout he was sorry.  I said you're not as sorry as you gonna be.  I, I had no idea about CBL, you know the Contract Buyers League.  But I felt like I got, you know I always wanted to get revenge, and I was wrong.  I mean I'm--that's wrong.  But I wanted to--at that time I wanted revenge on this boy.  I wanted to expose him.  I wanted to make--fix it so he wouldn't be able to get another client.  But they all talked me out of it, I'm glad they did.
Speaker 1: Now who, now who talked you out of it?
Speaker 2: Well different ones that I told, you know like around Jack [Macnamara] probably was one.  And some of the fellas around there, they always say, "[HistoryMaker] Ruth [Wells] that doesn't even sound like you, that you wanna, you know hurt--"
Speaker 1: Now--
Story_ID: 192558
Speaker 1: Okay now you mentioned Jack, now this is Jack Macnamara, right?  Now he was an organizer for Contract Buyers League?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  See he was a Jesuit.
Speaker 1: Tell me, let's go back to the beginning.  Tell me now how did you get involved with Contract Buyers League and how did Contract Buyers League start?
Speaker 2: Okay, that's the first part of it.  My anger at my, my own attorney.  Then I called Father [Jack] Egan to ask for an attorney that I could trust.
Speaker 1: Okay, now why did you call Father Egan?  Did you know Father Egan?
Speaker 2: No, but--yes I had met Father E--Father Egan.  A girl down the street from me that I had known for years told me that if I have problems such as this, that Father Egan was good at helping people.  And I said, "Well I'm not Catholic."  She said he--"It doesn't matter with him.  If you're in need, whether you're a Catholic or not, say you can call him."  So I had been talking with him 'bout other things.  And then I got to talking--I told him, I asked him for a lawyer, if he knew any.  He said, "You know what?"  He say, "Yeah I know a lawyer, let me think a while and I'll call you back."  So he called me back.  He said, "You know what?  I don't want you--I know a lawyer and I'll be willing to get him for you.  But I want you to do me a favor."  He said what--"It's a young man, a young Jesuit here wanting something to do in the neighborhood to help."  He say, "Why don't you talk with him and the two of you get together on, on"--said, "I think that would be good for him to do."  So that's how I met Jack through Father Egan.
Speaker 1: Okay this is Jack Macnamara, okay.
Speaker 2: So when Jack came 'round there and to talk to me and he asked me was it okay if he send him around, and I said okay.  So we start talking and--
Speaker 1: What, he come to your house?  Okay.
Speaker 2: And so he asked me would I be willing to, you know to fight for my rights.  That he said, "I'm sure a lot of these other people here that own homes probably in the same boat with you."  And I, I said, "Well I don't know," 'cause I didn't--I really didn't know anybody but the woman I told you that was--lived down the street from me that introduced me to Father Egan.  I didn't know any of my neighbors because I, I was never home.  I worked all day and when I came home at night I had to start cooking and doing things in the house.  I never just hang out outside, you know, as they say over the fence talking because I never had the time.
Story_ID: 192559
Speaker 1: But anyway, then Jack [Macnamara] got these other young seminarians, younger guys that was still in school, you know, they get breaks.  And he want to do research on using the contracts, you know to do research.  Find out 'cause a lot of 'em was just numbers, you know instead of saying John Doe you know, owned this property, they had a what they call that number--I've forgotten, but it's probably in that book.  But anyway, they used the number instead of a name, which is okay, it's legal, that's legal.  But the thing about it is you don't know who to contact.  But they found out how to find these people.  And so they did.
Speaker 2: You're talking about the lot numbers in the--
Speaker 1: No, it's not a lot number, it's a, it's a number like you would register your name normally.  But instead of your name, you use a number.  And they got a special name they call that number, but I can't think of what it is.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But a lot of these young boys then did research, not just on the contracts but on who, who owned 'em.  They did research on the owners as well.  And so then we start meeting, just start getting the people in the--my community to come to a meeting in the gym or presentation school on Wednesday night.  And a lot of--no about a handful came at first.  And Jack explained what we was trying to do and all but nobody would respond, they wouldn't ask any questions and they wouldn't make a state--they wouldn't say nothing.  They just set up there and looked.  So then I found--I told my husband [James "Ira" Wells], I say you know Jack got an idea of what is needed to put something under these people and make 'em speak up.  I say but I don't know what it is.  I said so I'm jealous.  I told him I said Jack is it something you wanna say?  No, I can't think of nothing.  I said you want me to get up there and talk, or they won't listen--they won't talk to you--you respond, won't ask no questions.  He said, he said would you?  I said Jack I've never spoken in front of anybody, you know, you know a group of people.  Two, three or four, I said I never did that.  I said I don't know if I can do it.  He said you can do it; why can't you do it?  Well anyway he gave me encouragement to speak so that next Wednesday night I stood up and my knees were trembling and shaking, really.  So I was in a straight chair, I stood--walked around to the back of the chair as the kids used to say.  They thought I was being cool, I was nervous and trying to hold onto the chair so they wouldn't see me shaking like I was.  So I walked around and held onto the back of the chair, and then I began to speak.  And I told 'em my name and where I lived, and my situation.  I said how many of you on contract?  Boy the hands went up, you know and then in other words they started asking questions.  They start, you know, act--responding like I'm interested.
Story_ID: 192560
Speaker 1: So all it was the people was not--that's how I really got involved with that [Contract Buyers League] because of my anger about lack of response from my attorney.  They always say don't sign nothing till you get an attorney, you know you've always heard that.  Well there's nothing wrong with that if you get an attorney.  But if you get a, a dud like I had, false nothing there.  But I think that the guy paid him not to get the mortgage, or they just was buddy/buddy and, and he agreed not, but I know he didn't bother.  He didn't make one move.  I don't believe he made a call.  He certainly didn't call me.  And when--and every time I thought about that I got--I really got angry.  And that gave me the strength, a lot of the strength to do what I needed to do and didn't have the nerve to do it.  I mean I didn't have--but with them backing me, you know saying go ahead in a sense, it gave me strength.  And I--after I talked to those people holding onto the back of that chair, this was not a mixed crowd.  Well it was a few, I--probably was a few of the researchers might have been in there, the young guy.  But I mean most of 'em, all of the others were black.  And, and then I found out--they found out I was in the same boat they were in.  And so we begin to get to know each other and find out that we all in the same boat.  But we--then from there we met every Wednesday night.  Not, not necessarily in that place.  After Jack and some of the guys that was working with us got an apartment there in Lawndale, we would go up there on Wednesday night and eat and discuss our strategy for the following day or the next day.  And then we started to fundraising.  And I knew nothing about fundraising because--at that point because of the fact that I had never tried to raise any funds.  But he knew all about these type things and then what he didn't know, he knew somebody that could help him out, explain to him.  So it started from this anger I had against my attorney and then Father Egan having some of these seminarians who wanted to get involved, but didn't have a program.  So that sort of set the stage for the program, which is the Contract Buyers League, and me getting things done and learning quite a bit about real estate and how, how they operate.  And it's--you know whether you can do something about it or not, I find that it is very rewarding to have knowledge of a thing.  To know about it even if you, if you--even if you don't or are not able to do anything about it, but you know about it.  That's always important.  So every Wednesday night we had meetings and we would get together and we'd invite different lawyers and we finally got a whole slew of lawyers.  And--
Speaker 2: What lawyers helped you?
Speaker 1: Well Jenner & Block law firm helped.  Boodell & Sears.  I don't remember all of 'em.  It was around sixteen or seventeen lawyers representing us.  And then this one black lawyer [Bob Ming], I cannot call his name.  When we was trying to get a case to go to court, the other lawyer said we didn't have a case.  This one black lawyer who had taught a lot of those white lawyers the law, came in and got--and put it together, put us a case together for court.  But the others told us it wouldn't hold up in court.  But I'm not finding anything wrong with that, any prejudice or anything.  What I'm saying 'cause this, this black lawyer was the one that taught these white lawyers.  A lot--not, not every one of 'em, but must of 'em went to school with him, you know he--under him.  He was their professor.  He died in, in the '70s [1970s] I, I would say.  But I, I don't remember his name.  Maybe--I don't know whether it's--it should be in there.
Speaker 2: It's probably in this literature.
Speaker 1: Yeah because otherwise we would not have gone to court 'cause the other guys, the lawyers couldn't find sufficient evidence that we had reasons to go to court.  But he, he was good but you wouldn't have liked him; I didn't like him.  But he was a--he, he knew the law.
Story_ID: 192561
Speaker 1: Now what was your case?  What, what, what were you--
Speaker 2: Suing for?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what were, what, what was the issue?  The issue--I mean, yeah--
Speaker 2: Was--well discrimination was part of it.  Because of the way they went about--like they, they actually cheated their own, the white people that they bought the houses from, using fear tactics.  They would get a woman, a black woman with lots of children and give her an apartment.  If they get a building empty.  Maybe they be done bought somebody's building.  Put a black woman in there with all these kids and let 'em go outside and play.  Then they would call them, the other white people, and tell them that the black folks coming in here 'cause you see that woman with all them kids.  That, that's running all over the place.  That's dirty.  But they would--these are the, the blockbusters that was doing it.  They--them black kids.  And you know if one come, all of 'em coming.
Speaker 1: There's a term in this literature called panic peddling.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Panic peddlers, blockbusters, same thing, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, same thing.  That's the same difference.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They go in and they frighten the white.  'Cause see they use--see when people like prejudice is one thing.  They use that against them without them realizing they're doing it.  They use that prejudice against 'em.  If a black person move in here, I'm moving.  I ain't staying in here.  So they know, they know that's the way they feel, so they call 'em up and tell 'em.  You know in case they didn't see all the little black kids running around, I'm gonna call 'em up and tell 'em a lot of black kids down the street.  You better get out while the getting--
Speaker 1: Now that's something.  I didn't know that detail, that they would actually try to bring in someone with a whole lot of kids to scare the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, to scare the white people.  See they know--okay they know you--that's what I mean by using your prejudice against you.  Now normally see those houses--lot of 'em probably sold cheaper than they would have under normal circumstances.  If they had just decide well for whatever reason, you know I'm gonna sell my house and I'm gonna move.  Well it wasn't like that.  I got to sell my house 'cause I got to get out of here 'fore them black people get up in here.  So they had to sell maybe a few thousand dollars cheaper 'cause they weren't, houses weren't high at that point.  Now I think that house that I had would be very expensive if it wasn't in that neighborhood.  It was a good house, nice, inside and out and it had that beautiful woodwork that you wouldn't believe was in that neighborhood, but it was there.  It was simply beautiful.  But it was in the wrong area and they--and I couldn't--I tried to get the club--the, the block club to work, let's work together 'cause back then when we was doing all the fighting and all, a guy told me, he said now the white people in about twenty-something years, are gonna come back into the city.  He said they all flew to the, to the suburbs to get away from the black.  But they gonna find out it's not working too well out there 'cause they having problems that you don't know about.  And they gonna wanna come back into the city.  And say what you do, the money you save from the renegotiated contract, put it back in the property and keep it up and try to get your neighbors to do the same thing, and hold on to this property 'cause this is prime property in this area.  You're right in the middle of everything.  You got good transportation, the "L" [elevated train], the buses, everything right here.  You don't have to drive your car downtown if you got a business or a job downtown.  You don't even need to drive, just get on the "L" every morning.  And it's, and it's--this is prime stuff.
Story_ID: 192562
Speaker 1: I talked to them, but you know if you can't show a person something and you are in the same boat with me, you figure who do I think I am telling you about what to do and, and so on.  And they don't, they don't listen.  Just bounce off; don't even go in one ear and out the other, it bounces off the ear.  But that's the way we are.  That's just the way we are.  So you do the best you can and what, what I did was whatever information I was able to get, I passed it on.  Now what they did with it or didn't do with it, I couldn't do that 'cause they grown, you can't tell 'em what to do.  All you can do is tell 'em you know, what's going on so they kind of figure it out for themselves.  So we, we got able to get these lawyers.  Well I already know without anybody telling--had not it been for Father [Jack] Egan, we wouldn't have been able to get the lawyer, not the high caliber lawyers we had.  Jenner & Block was one of the best in the--supposed to be in the city.  And--
Speaker 2: Well who were the names of some of the lawyers that--
Speaker 1: I was trying to think of it then.  The one that, that I told you was--he--they loaned him out for a U.S. Attorney for a while.  Do you remember the U.S. Attorney, any U.S. Attorneys' name?
Speaker 2: Just the recent ones.
Speaker 1: But not, not--
Speaker 2: Not from this--I don't remember any from the '60s [1960s], United States Attorneys in this region.
Speaker 1: I can't think of his name.  He was at--this guy that I'm trying to think of, was at our reunion the other year.  I tell you was bent over, him.  He was, he was one of our lawyers from Jenner & Block.  And there was another young guy that I just loved to hear him talk.  But he died kind of sudden.  He was--seemed to have been younger than the others.  He died with cancer.  And he would do our case some days, you know.  And he was good, he was really good.  And had the most--I don't know--sound of his voice, was a voice you didn't forget.  You know how some people got that special kind of voice?  Well that's the way he--he had.  But he came down with--diagnosed with cancer and died.  I said hated--I didn't want to believe it.
Speaker 2: Now what about--there are some names that are in this document, like Rabbi Robert Marks.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's the head of the Jewish something Council or something.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, Jewish Council on Urban Affairs.  Yeah, and Victor Rosenblum, Northwestern Law School.  Do you remember him?
Speaker 1: Not by face.  I remember the name, that's all.
Speaker 2: Gordon Sherman--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember him.
Speaker 2: Now what did he do?
Speaker 1: He, he works closely with us and advising and you know, helping us along, even the picketing.  We--did you know we, we had police officers and, and lawyers.  They're not supposed to picket, you know that.  A police officer or a lawyer or thing--okay.  They would disguise themselves like bums and get in line (laughter).
Story_ID: 192563
Speaker 1: It says the name of the, the court case here is Jones versus Mayer [Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer & Co., 1968].  Was that the name of the, the case that you all filed in '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: I think that's the one.
Speaker 1: Jones versus Alfred H. Mayer and Company.
Speaker 2: I'm not--I don't remember that name.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, all right well maybe not.  Right, but he's a black attorney.
Speaker 2: Right, that's the one--
Speaker 1: Civil rights attorney.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's him.
Speaker 1: So he's the one that died in the '70s [1970s] you're, you're talking about, [William Robert] Bob Ming, okay.
Speaker 2: Right, in prison.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: 'Bout income tax.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.  Bob Ming had a, a very nasty mouth.
Speaker 1: Did he.
Speaker 2: You know he, he was just--I mean that was a part of him, that was him, you know.  And I don't know this, but I always figured some--he insulted the wrong person and he was real good at insulting people.  He didn't care whether you boy or girl, white or black, big shot or nothing.  He just--that was just him, he just talk nasty and insulting.  I never understood why he didn't go get help, you know he needed help I thought.  Well he must have insulted somebody--the wrong, at the wrong place or the wrong time.  But anyway they had him--got him for income tax.  What had happened, his accountant had died sudden, you know he wasn't sick, just died.  And Ming thought he, he normally had, had--would have paid whatever he supposed to pay, the income tax, you know.  You know, I'm sure you know that people, big business people and big shots don't pay income tax like we do.  They pay either quarterly, every six months or every year, one of the two, however they decide individually how to pay it.  Well he didn't--I guess he didn't pay and he was going around insulting people as usual.  And then IRS [Internal Revenue Service] got to him and asked him I guess what about the money.  And, and he said well his accountant had taken care of that 'cause normally he would have.  But like I say, the man dropped dead sudden like and then they kept on and so he--they got him in court.  I don't know how they finally got him court, but they got him in court.  And the way the news media had it, they didn't say it, but you know how you--writers can write and make you think this and actually it's that, you know it's something else.  You read writers such as that.  Well anyway, the last night of the trial was the night that the jury was gonna come in and, you know with the verdict.  And we went down.  And they locked that man up that night.  The jury find him guilty, locked him up and I done forgot how much bond was, but you know you have to pay cash and they don't accept checks or money orders; you pay cash.  So we had to go 'round from different lawyers' office and get his petty cash out of his office and pool it and pay him out of jail that night because they locked him up.  But he ended up in prison about that same thing.  He--like the news media had made me--when I was reading the paper and everything, thinking that he was dodging income, from paying income tax.  He won't pay income tax.  And not just now, but in the past, you know.  And then when I got down to court, it was totally different.  He didn't know he hadn't paid income tax.  I still don't understand the case.  I didn't get it all and I didn't follow through on all of it.  Yet he ended up in prison.  And he already had a weak heart or something.  And this was a complete washout for him.  He couldn't handle the fact, "I'm in prison."  You know we--he couldn't handle that.  So he died.
Story_ID: 192564
Speaker 1: Well he [William Robert "Bob" Ming] was somebody that helped--initially he helped you all.
Speaker 2: He, he was the one that brought the case [Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer & Co., 1968].  In other words said that we have a case.  Everybody--all the other lawyers say we didn't have a case.  It was wrong, but legally it's not on the books, so we can't--
Speaker 1: This is 1969 I guess, right?
Speaker 2: I guess so.  I, I, I--no need of me saying that.  I don't really remember what year it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So well what happened?  I mean what, what did--how, how were things resolved?
Speaker 2: Let me tell you, here's this Albert Jenning, wait a minute, I'm sorry, Tom Sullivan is one of the lawyers from Jenner and Block.  Remember I told you I couldn't remember the name.  But that was--
Speaker 1: Tom Sullivan.
Speaker 2: Tom Sullivan.  Look on page seventy-seven.
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna look at it right now.  I'm just gonna ask questions.  But, but, but that's, that's a--yeah so Tom Sullivan was one of the lawyers that--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Well he was one of the--
Speaker 1: And, and what did Tom--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was from Jenner & Block.
Speaker 1: All right.  So what happened?  Now you all filed a lawsuit and what, what, what, what was the basis of your lawsuit, what was the--and, and what were you trying to get?
Speaker 2: We were trying to get the contracts renegotiated.  And they wouldn't do it, you know because they say it was legal, which in--on--in the law, the law say it was legal, but immorally wrong of what they did, how they did it.  And how they--for an example, they buy a house from you today, sell it to me, okay buy this house for ten thousand dollars or twelve at the most.  Then tomorrow they sell it to me for 25 thousand, okay.  And they look at each--
Speaker 1: And using blockbusting techniques to get--to acquire the property.
Speaker 2: To get--to acquire the property.  They go in and, and they bring some--they didn't charge these people rent, you know that.  They would--the black people that they brought in with all the kids, they didn't charge--didn't have to pay nothing.  They probably just want, you know, keep 'em in there to be seen by the white.  And when the white see 'em, first thing they gonna holler I'm getting out of here 'cause they start moving black people in here, so they move.  They knew that, they wanted that.  And this is what they went after 'cause they, you know use, as I said earlier using their prejudice against them, themselves.  But anyway, then that worked and, and the phone calls.  In case somebody like--those were working class people.  Just in case you was at work the day and didn't see the little black kids running around, I'm gonna call you tonight when you get home and tell you them little black kids, I saw them black kids, a lot of 'em, you know.  So they--and the white people would run and sell 'em.  They sell 'em the property.  And for little of nothing.  And then they would take it and raise it, the price, and sell it to black.  Go downtown to any of the banks that give mortgages and get a mortgage on it.  You can't get one, but they--you paying their mortgage.  See it was really a well-planned out scheme to see how dirty you could be.  And they could--they sunk to the bottom.  'Cause see they not only was cheating us, they was cheating they own, their own.  All they wanted was money.  You know it didn't matter whether they got it from the white people or the black.  Of course the black people gonna get the hard end of the stick, but the sharp end of the stick, but that's the way it was.
Story_ID: 192565
Speaker 1: Okay now as you said, people knew--I mean anybody looking at this knows it's wrong.  But is it illegal?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And so the, the lawyers were telling you you didn't have a case.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And the only one that thought you had a case was [William Robert] Bob Ming.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Well see he proved 'cause the judge not gonna accept anything you take up in there and just say I'm gonna file a suit because this paper is white, it should have been blue.  You know what I mean?  I mean with just any old thing.  But when you get--when, when you go up in there, as the attorneys, you not gonna--you can't go to court with anything you wanna go to court with.  There are certain things you have to--it has to have certain things about it, the case, to make it a case.  They'll tell you you don't have a case, and you don't sometime.  But see the thing--they were--it was--the way they went about getting the property and the way you know like they upped the price, inflated the price, and the interest they charged--they didn't go--they couldn't go outside of the line, but went as high as they could go.  At that time it was about seven percent and that's where they went.  But a lot of the houses was much lower, not up there, but I mean people buy a house, they bought it at a lower rate of interest.  But they went high, sold it to us as high as they could go and which was 7 percent.
Story_ID: 192566
Speaker 1: Okay, now you said before we got started that there came a time when you were leading this movement.  That you were able to--you talked to people you never thought you'd talk to in life, you know, prior to that point.  I mean you were--you talked to a lot of big shots and you were able to you know, kind of unload on some, some people in high places, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: But you know now during the--I only talked to rich people during the Contract Buyers League.  There were others I guess talked to the, the big shots, you know the leaders.  You know like the officials I'll say.  But we would write letters to fath--not fath--yeah that priest that was in charge of Archdioceses here in Chicago at the time.
Speaker 1: Cody, Cardinal [John] Cody.
Speaker 2: Cody.  We'd send him letters, telegrams, phone calls.  I don't think we had email then.
Speaker 1: What were you trying to tell him?
Speaker 2: We tried to get him to--see we found out the Archdioceses owned a lot of that property out south.  Not, not over here, out south.  See those people had new homes.  But it was in the same boat, you know as far as contracts and all concerned, except they had a new house.  But you know it was like a--it wasn't no nice house.  Well it wasn't better than an old house.  But what I'm saying is I call 'em little matchboxes.  I just call them that, me personally.
Speaker 1: You mean those little bungalows.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: On the South Side.
Speaker 2: But anyway, that's better than what they had in the first place.  So--but you know you--these people was slow about coming.  That was one of the ladies over there I think that had that ten thousand dollars to pay down and they wouldn't take it, to get a mortgage.
Speaker 1: So they were selling--even on the South Side they were selling.
Speaker 2: They were doing things, yeah.
Speaker 1: The bungalows.
Speaker 2: I don't know how they got they property over there.  I mean the--how the, the blockbuster got--but they built up all these houses and the--and sold 'em to the black.  But they were inflated.  It was--because couldn't a black person buy a decent house for anything back then.  Because of the fact that you were black and you not gonna get no conventional mortgage, and that, that's just the way it was.
Story_ID: 192567
Speaker 1: So tell me about the times that you had to speak you know on, on behalf of the Contract Buyers League.  What was the, what was the most--some of your most significant, you know, presentations then?
Speaker 2: Well you know I can't, I can't really remember a lot of--I did, you know like I had to talk every Wednesday night, but that was mostly to people that--as I say was in the same boat I--but they had, had--we had grown so because they see--we--like our team, we started off in the teens, thirteen, fourteen, something like that.  And then we got where we didn't have a place for 'em to stand, let alone sit.  And then we'd have meeting and sometime the lawyers would come, which would bring more people, you know.  And I had to talk one night with a group, a lot of people.  And the lawyers and their constituents.  And [William Robert "Bob"] Ming was there, and he was very insulting.  This one lady got up and said Mrs. Wells told me such-and-such.  I don't remember what it was.  And he came out with, "Who died and left Ms. Wells a lawyer?"  He was real nasty.  He was--not just to me, I was just one person.  He'd be nasty anybody, I don't care who you were; he was nasty, real nasty.  But I talked to them.  I've talked to quite a few people at their--what is this University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] or--
Speaker 2: Not Northwestern, the one down--right off the Eisenhower Expressway, not too far off the Eisenhower Expressway.
Speaker 1: University of Illinois [at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That, that--what's that big place hold about 10,000 people?
Speaker 1: The [UIC] Pavilion.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I spoke in front of them not long ago, 'bout five years ago.  But at the Contract Buyer [League], I'm trying to think--I'm, I'm really trying to think of what--who all did I speak in front of.  I forgot.  At fundraisers I had to speak.  And on television, Channel 2, 5, 7, 9 and 32 and Channel 11, I had to speak there on television, but I really liked radio 'cause I can act ugly on radio.  Don't nobody see me.  You know I don't worry 'bout how you dress, just go your--I like the radio but I didn't particularly care for television, but I did television a lot at the time.  They used to have what they call editorial at the--the end of the news--yeah, the news of the news on.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I used to do rebuttals to that editorial on television right, right behind the news.  But anyway people was breaking in my house when I was living over there on Lexington and everything.  And a, a lady that I knew real well, her husband was a psychiatrist.  And he told me, he said you see in the neighborhood you live in Ms. Wells, he said they see you when they watch the news, then they--you come on right behind the news after the--you know the rebut--the editorial.  They think you is a--like a news person and you getting big money.  So they figure if they break in your house, they may find some of it.  That's why they keep breaking in your house.
Speaker 1: Who was the psychiatrist?  Was that--
Speaker 2: I don't even remember the name.
Speaker 1: Black psychiatrist?
Speaker 2: No, he was white.
Speaker 1: White, okay.
Speaker 2: This young woman was--had been married.  She married her college sweetheart.  And he developed something that made him an overnight millionaire.  But he didn't have time for home that much because he was, you know, on the go all the time.  And she divorced him and married this guy, this psychiatrist.  And I ask her, I say well what did he do?  The reason you left.  She said he didn't do anything, he just didn't have time for me.  And he, and she say I want a family and I want a home life.  She say I want a husband and children, have that type of life.  She said but he don't have time for that.  And I said but he became a millionaire.  (Laughter) She said--that don't make no difference.  She say I can make money and my husband can make money.  She say that be enough for us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We don't have to be millionaires 'cause--
Story_ID: 192568
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well what was the biggest moment that you think in this case?
Speaker 1: In the CBL [Contract Buyers League] case?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  And how did you feel about it?
Speaker 1: Well the biggest moment was knowing--when I first realized that something could be done about the situation I was in.  And that there are people out there that are willing to help you without compensation.  That everything isn't money, you know.  Well if I do this, you don't have to pay me, you know.  But everything--there are people out there don't feel that way.  And they're not all rich people, or even what we call well-to-do.  They are just plain old everyday people like us.  And they will get up and go and help out where they think it's needed.  And I like--when I realized that I wasn't alone I guess, that I--it's plenty people willing to help.  People that you never dreamed about.  And I met a lot of people, some very nice, but all very interesting and I find people can be interesting 'cause you learn something about each person.  You know this person has this type of personality.  Maybe you like it or maybe you don't, but you learn about it, you know.  And that's just the way I guess--I can't remember any particular incident right offhand that you know I could say well boy when that happened, you know.  We had a lot of exciting times and we had a lot of sad times.
Story_ID: 192569
Speaker 1: I remember we went to court with a lady and she lost that day, this was individual but it was out of our group.  And I was--after she left, most people had gone home and I had--I was waiting on someone that I was gonna ride with and was in--still the courtroom.  And I'm standing outside the door in the court, right outside the door.  So this man, this real estate man came out.  Well I'm sorry, y'all lost today.  And I don't know what--'cause I didn't even know the man was in there.  I don't know what made me think, I say what are you having for dinner tomorrow?  I'm having a turkey and all the trimmings like everybody else American.  I said I hope you don't choke on it.  That man--now you won't believe, that man went home and see I know--you know it's a rumor out that all black people use voodoo.  I don't even know what it is, I'm just saying.  That man went home, got on the phone, call the office and told us he want to renegotiate tonight, I'm not gonna wait till in the morning.  Yes he did.  But you know what?  He was afraid.  I don't know what I'm--I don't even know what made me say that.  I couldn't have planned it, it was definitely not premeditated, because I didn't know the man was in the courtroom.  You know I thought practically everybody was gone but myself and whoever I was waiting for to ride home with.  I don't even know who that was.  And I--I didn't--I figured maybe some of the employees, the court people, may be in there.  But I did not know he was still that courtroom.  And he came out there and, and pretend he feel sorry for us because we lost the case, that particular case.  And I knew he was being sarcastic, I knew that.  So I was standing there, I say well what are you having for dinner?  I don't know why I asked that man, that ain't none of my business what he having for dinner.  It was the day before Thanks--I said what are you having for dinner tomorrow?  He said I'm having turkey with all the trimming like everybody--all the other Americans.  I said I hope you don't choke on it, and that's all I had to say, that's all I said to the man.  I don't even know why I said that to that man.
Speaker 2: You think he, in retrospect do you think he felt--he knew he was wrong?
Speaker 1: Well he knew he was wrong in the first place, morally wrong.  He knew he was wrong--that's--he already knew that.  And that was already tagging, you know tugging at him.  So when I opened my big mouth about you know, not choking on his food, he thinking I better get this straightened out tonight 'cause I wanna eat tomorrow.  See he wanted the next--like everybody else.  But here I'm coming talking 'bout he gonna choke.  I guess he figure well I'm not taking that chance.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it caused him to reflect on the mortality of us all and, and where we stand.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It, it--
Speaker 2: Where you stand in relationship to other people when you do, when you do things.
Speaker 1: Right, that's, that's right.
Speaker 2: That hurt others.
Speaker 1: And he--it just, it just woke up something inside of him.  And then I guess he, he knew there was a possibility--anybody can choke, I can choke to death.  I've known--I think that one, at least one of the Dorsey brothers I think died from something, sudden like that, choking on something.  The musical--used to play band, big band.
Speaker 2: Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  One of them--it's not both, but I think one of them died from that.  So you see--but I wasn't thinking about them.  That had happened already, but I wasn't thinking about that.  I wasn't thinking about--you know I was thinking about our situation and I was hoping we could get more people renegotiated.  But I, I don't think I--I wasn't thinking about that man, even though that was the case.  He was the head of the one we were suing.
Story_ID: 192570
Speaker 1: So did the court ever decide that those contracts should be renegotiated, or did they just or did it happen on its own?  How did it happen?
Speaker 2: It happened sort of like the one--only I didn't say that 'cause it was other people, you know, threatened, but it sort of happened they just seemed to have come to the--well you know we talked to some of 'em wives.  Meet 'em for lunch and have--even if you didn't want no lunch.  You know maybe you have a cup of tea or something.
Speaker 1: Now who--whose idea was that to--
Speaker 2: Different strategies that we had.  Like Jack [Macnamara] and maybe Baker [ph.] or Ross [ph.] or some, somebody in the group would say well you think--and, and Jack would tell us things that we wouldn't ordinarily know.  For an example, he said that if a white man is doing something illegal or immoral, he doesn't want his wife to know about it.  So they figure well then why--they figure from why, the wife doesn't know they doing what they're doing and how they're doing it.  They know they--they may know that I purchased a couple of pieces of property, you know.  They might, you know may have known that.  But they don't know how they went about it; how they got the property, what they doing with it, they just got some property.  But they don't know the details.  So we did two or three--I don't know whether it was three meetings with the wives, had met 'em for lunch.  And they in turn--see word of mouth works too.  In turn they went you know, like and faced their husbands about what is this I hear about them people out there, 'bout the contracts or something?  And they insisted on them telling 'em.  So I heard, I didn't hear, I didn't hear her say it, that this one woman told her husband he, he had to, he had twenty-four hours to call them people and do what--whatever is right.  You gonna do it.  And, and that's how we got a lot of 'em renegotiated.  And then some of them, I don't know what changed their minds or what made 'em wanna renegotiate.  I don't, I don't know.  But then for the example this one--this one--renegotiate.  So if you came in and say okay bring me your figures.  Then you wanna renego--after you see that, you wanna renegotiate what you do is call the office.  And say I wanna renegotiate.  And that's how a lot of 'em came in, you know they, they would renege--if you wanted to renegotiate, they'd renegotiate.  If ten wanted to renegotiate, the ten--
Speaker 1: So--
Story_ID: 192571
Speaker 1: What you're saying is that the Contract Buyers League would then shepherd your case through--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --and help you renegotiate your contract (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Do the figuring, check--you checking right along with them, you know.  And then--and if, and if you're gonna--if you need a mortgage, some didn't need a mortgage after that.  But if you need a mortgage, they, they took care of that too, help you get it.  And see more people were opening up to us 'cause they don't want no bad publicity.  And the news media had taken that, that group and ran wild with it.  You were on every television station there is.  You were in every newspaper we had.  And I'm not--I don't mean just you in there this week so maybe we'll miss you a couple of weeks.  No, you were in there every day practically, 'cause we were doing something.  Did we get to the--are we on tape?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, well you know they set us--some of our people out.  The sheriff set some of our people out because we decided to go on a rent--I mean a payment strike.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But now everybody brought the money in a money order to, to us, to the office, no cash, just money orders.  And wouldn't, wouldn't accept a check 'cause you don't know whether they got, you know, check--all checks don't clear.  But if you buy a money order, it's there, you know.  So they brought 'em to the office and they--and so the sheriff come and set 'em out after a certain length of time.  And we would have our gang together at 4:00 a.m.  They meet at the office, get together, and go and, and when the sheriff set 'em out and leave, we'd go put 'em back in.  They never arrested us.  But you--I--we knew we was right.  Did I tell you, did I tell you about a little thing happened with the man that I had purchased from?  He was downtown there on Washington, all the way downtown.  We went down to see him.  Father Egan and some of the other big wigs went with me, but they stood like back there and I had to come up here and talk with the, the owner, you know.  And that was about that 1500 dollars insurance.
Speaker 1: That was insurance, yeah.  Fee that they added to your payment, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well you know I told you I been praying and believing in God ever since I could remember myself.  When I was real small, I tell you 'bout I prayed and told God to come get me because the people down here was mean.  Well I still believed in this same God.  Before I went down that morning, I knew I was going.  So I, I prayed and I asked the Lord if I was kind of teedle tobbling [ph.], not sure I was right.  I said now we did sign the contract.  But we don't know--we're no lawyers.  Now we had a lawyer, but which didn't do us any good.  But anyway, I said pray, said a prayer before I left.  And I asked the Lord to let me know before I leave from down there that--whether I'm right or wrong.  Whatever way--
Story_ID: 192572
Speaker 1: --We can finish that story about you confronting your landlord.  Now you, you said you prayed on it and everything and you went to see him.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--
Speaker 1: And Father [Jack] Egan and, and--
Speaker 2: And some more of the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, they stood behind you, but they didn't--
Speaker 2: They stood in back of me, in the back.  Background and--
Speaker 1: Where were you at, in his office, or--
Speaker 2: In his office.
Speaker 1: His office, okay.
Speaker 2: And I was sitting in front of his desk like he was sitting in back of the desk and I was in front.  And I asked him about the 1,500 dollar insurance that he had me paying.  And I asked him did he think, forgot and thought I lived on North Shore Drive.  And he, he, he said no he didn't, but then he, he talked a few minutes, you know, making a few excuses about why it cost so much and, and all this.  And then the--he called for his secretary to bring the policy in.  So she brought in a policy and gave it to him.  And then as I was--as he went to reach across the desk to pass me the policy, his hands couldn't hardly hold the paper.  See I knew him, he wasn't that type of--he didn't--he didn't act--he's afraid of nothing.  He big bad wolf type person.  You know like rough and gruff and he just didn't, you know back down or anything.  But see I think that when he looked in back of me and saw who was back there, he knew it was all over for him.  But he didn't know how (unclear) and he was nervous and, and then you know I think guilt weighs heavily on a person, anyway.  I mean when you know you downright guilty of whatever it is you being accused of, you don't function too well.  It works on you.  I don't care how strong.  Now this man was--if you say something him he--just big, bad guy.  And here he is can't hold a piece of paper in his hand.  He's trembling, shaking.  And it just like I saw it, it just came to me that's the sign you asked for, you all right.  Then boy was I bad after that.  Look who I got on my side, the Lord himself.  And I knew we were gonna do all right.  Okay we don't win--if we don't win the case in court, but we won them then.  They were the ones that were doing the dam--had done the damage and was sitting back.  And I told him about--I say yeah, and I say your daughter down there at such-and-such school, and I'm paying for her to go to school.  That upset that man.  Not because I'm bad, that part didn't upset him, he don't care 'bout me paying--I knew where his daughter was.  And he knew--he thought well they--I don't know what they gonna do to my daughter, you know.  He probably moved her.  He was really frightened.  That man was as frightened as any man you ever seen.  He was frightened.  Because see now he wouldn't have been that frightened had he been right, doing whatever it was that he was doing, do it right.  He, he would not have been that frightened.  But that man was scared half to death.  His hand was shaking and, and he--well I--well just forget about the policy, you know.  In other words, I'm ready to give in.  But, but it was because--it was--a lot of it was guilt ridden.  And see I think--and then he--people kind of feel 'bout their priest and nuns, special feelings.  And when they see them fighting for something, they feel they must be right.  And I think that's what--that and determination.  People really--with a, a belief and was willing to die for that belief.  Standing up to anything, anybody, and, and see determination sometime really can carry you through.  That is not--when people--you know I, I found that a lot of people--if you say anything about scripture, you kind of shake 'em up a little bit.  But I don't know why because I like scripture.  But a lot of people are afraid, you know if you quote the Bible or something.  Don't wanna hear that.  But and so--and I had, had a habit--and it is, it wasn't something that was premeditated.  I didn't sit somewhere and plan these things.  Things just come to me and I say 'em.  But I, I know now that I'm with--among people that I can't just say things, so I, I pray for that too.  I pray for my--to, to guide my tongue 'cause you know it gets loose sometime.  They say that's the busiest thing about a person is they tongue (laughter).  So I have to pray 'cause I can't control it all the time.  Sometime it get loose.
Speaker 1: Now--
Story_ID: 192573
Speaker 1: Now there's a story you told during the break too of a lawyer who was in opposition to you [Contract Buyers League], who got to court and started speaking in favor of you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He spoke--see at first--
Speaker 1: You think his name was Block or Brock or something.
Speaker 2: I think Block, B-L-O-C-K.  I'm not sure, but his name got to be in here.
Speaker 1: Well don't, don't look now, but just--
Speaker 2: Okay he was the--he died during this time.  They found out--I mean they took him to the hospital to have--they say he was going there 'cause something was wrong with his eye, but they were lying.  It was something wrong with his head.  I don't' know how, why or what it was--
Speaker 1: Now it's not--we, we're, talking about what happened afterwards.  But what happened in court, what happened in court?  What did he do?
Speaker 2: He was saying things that was actually helpful to our case.  Everything he said was helpful to our case.  He never said anything against us; everything--but everything was against his side.  He was on their side, he wasn't on our side.  And even--and it, and it--we, the people in the courtroom, there was always a lot of people in the courtroom, 'cause it's a lot of us.  People would take off from work and go, you know.  And they, they was looking at each other, what's wrong?  And, and they--we couldn't figure it out.  But he snapped. That's what it was.  That man snapped and--but the strange thing about that, let's say he did snap.  But why was he helpful to us?  The judge stopped the trial.  He told him, he said well I can't see you--he say who's side are you on?  The real estate or the contract buyers?  You know.  He, he, he didn't answer.  And see the other lawyers, it was--they all was standing there.  Like we all like was over here.  But only the, the spectators was sitting in the usual place.  But our lawyers was standing over here and the contract--and the sellers was standing over here.  Now these lawyers gathered around him and we couldn't see him real good.  But he, he postponed the trial for tomorrow or something like that.  I mean the judge did.  And, and they took him out.  Then the next day they came saying he was in the hospital for a check 'cause he was having a problem with his eye.  Now your eye don't make you talk crazy.  That man was talking way out of line.  And he--what he was saying was good, was right, proper for us.  But it, but he wasn't for us, so he wasn't supposed to be talking for us.
Story_ID: 192574
Speaker 1: Now you said that two figures in Chicago [Illinois] history during that time who had, who commanded a great deal of respect and, and authority, were two figures are, are Cardinal [John] Cody and Mayor Daley.  Richard J. Daley, right at the time now.  And you say that they, they, they didn't say anything.
Speaker 2: They--not one word.  Haven't heard from 'em yet.  Don't care how we cont--try to contact 'em.  We, we could contact their office, but they never would respond.  But we found that the Archdioceses owned that--a lot of that property on the South Side where those people had those homes.  But so maybe that's the reason.  They didn't wanna explain that.
Speaker 1: So they stayed clear of it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they stayed clear, both, they both stayed clear.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now was there, was there ever a court decision that, that was rendered in your favor in this?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't think so.  But it was--you know it was so--it's been so long ago.
Speaker 1: But you're saying the, the litigation was important, but the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But the--you got to the, the, the realtors really.  I mean you got to them with other strategies, yeah.  So how long did you work with Contract Buyers League?
Speaker 2: 'Bout four years I guess.
Speaker 1: Until the mid-'70s [1970s] I guess, or, or, or early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: 'Bout early '70s [1970s], I think.
Story_ID: 192575
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So I guess things were resolved by--now there's a piece that we're--the piece that we're referring to for the sake of those who are watching this, is an article that should be in your archive box by the, the--that appeared in the Atlantic Monthly April of 1972 called 'In My Father's House There Are Many Mansions and I'm Gonna Get Me Some of Them Too.'  Which is a, a quote from Lucille Johnson, who is one of your--
Speaker 1: One of the buyers.
Speaker 2: One of your co-volunteers I guess.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: One of the buyers, yeah.
Speaker 1: And she worked, she worked with us, you know whenever we went out, she went.
Speaker 2: And this article appeared--it was written by James Allen McPherson.  The story of the Contract Buyers League, April '70 (1970) to the Atlantic Monthly.  Okay.  But I--now so I, I suppose everything was basically resolved in '72 (1972) the, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically.  It was about all solved then.  All the--most of the--the contracts were renegotiated and we, we stirred up enough that we got people's attention and let them know what's going on.  You know just like those men didn't want their wives what they were doing, how they was making their money.  And, but they found out anyway because when they saw the, the news media and, and then meeting with some of the people too.  And see if--say for example if we, if someone met with this man's wife and they talked and she found out what was going on, she is gonna watch the news and we're gonna be in the news.  And when she see other news, Walter Cronkite did a thing for us one evening with his--had a pointer like a, a teacher.  And had like on the blackboard breaking it down from start to finish.  And that was on coast-to-coast.  I had told, by the way, I told my seller while I was in his office that day, that I would--I said how would you like to hear--have Walter Cronkite to explain about you coast-to-coast?  But I didn't know what I was talking 'bout.  I had no dream about Walter Cronkite would listen if I called him.  You know if I called his office, or would call me back.  I had not a dream, but, but I just would say things just come up in my big mouth and I'd say it.  You know if I put you on TV coast-to-coast with Walter Cronkite, you ain't gonna want that--them people to know you're like you are.  You know that type of talk.  It's--I was--I would be off (unclear) about it.  I would be off.  And call Walter Cronkite's office and got him.  They--I mean not him, you know, but they called us back and they wanted to know a little more and they was all over the place and he had it on television that evening standing up there with that pointer.  And this is how they bought it.  And went on down the thing.  I know that man--that probably caused some of them folks' death.  See they don't--they didn't--they wasn't hurting because "I cheated them people."  That, that wasn't it.  They were hurting because of the way they had done--which they knew was wrong.  And they, and they couldn't stand for you to know "I do things like that."  Just like you got family and friends that if you decide to do something stupid, you know, wrong, you wouldn't want them people to know about it and would hurt worse to know that they know you did that, see.  Well that's the situation with a lot of those people.  He didn't want his daughter or wife to know.  He didn't know his daughter to know how he was putting her through school.  How he got the property, he cheated the white.  And how he sold it to the black for inflated prices.  And knew they couldn't get a mortgage, but he told 'em they could.  You know when the, when the, you know at a--after a certain amount was paid in.  Not at first.  But had we not--had not it been for the Contract Buyer, you couldn't get a mortgage today, a black person.  I mean a conventional mortgage.  But a lot of people have to suffer for the rest of us.  Just like those people that died when [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was march--marching.  Some of 'em died--white and black died--
Story_ID: 192576
Speaker 1: Tell me, do you think that--I know you all started in '68 [1968], basically.  Was it the, the death of [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] that--do you think that helped agitate people to do some, something about you know, the conditions on the West Side?
Speaker 2: It could have.  But I, I don't, I don't know how to answer that 'cause people--
Speaker 1: You think people, you know.
Speaker 2: People are, are--it's still a mystery to me as to what moves 'em and what doesn't move 'em.  You know that's still a mystery to me, I'm still studying on that.  I, I don't know.  You know like I tried to get the pastor we had at the time, I tried to get him to get involved, get the people involved 'cause it was--
Speaker 1: What church were you going to?
Speaker 2: Metropolitan.  And he told me, he said Mrs. Wells let me tell you.  He say you know we a strange people.  I said yeah I know that.  He said these people not gonna be--will not take part in that.  I said why not?  I said because we're all in the same boat.  Yeah, but you don't know.  And he was--seemed so disgusted.  He said you don't know these people here.  And since he's been dead, and I worked closer in the church, I know what he's talking 'bout but I can't explain it.
Story_ID: 192577
Speaker 1: So it's hard to understand what, what kicks a movement off I guess in some respects.  But--now did you all [Contract Buyers League] have to, in those days, did you have to go knocking on doors or calling people up and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  See a lot of those young college kids did a lot of that.  Knocking on--from door-to-door.  Knocking on doors, talking to 'em about house and the contract, and did they get it on contract and so on.  And that's what got a lot of 'em out.  And then another thing, that night that I told you I had to hold onto the chair to stand up to talk.  That little hand--we didn't have but a little handful that night.  But see from--they was--they talked to they neighbors.  You better come go 'round here with me and hear what these people got to say.  Even though if they didn't understand what we was saying at the time.  But they knew it was something that they needed to be involved in.  So they told they neighbors and everything.  And then, then they--we come--if they come back next Wednesday night, they bring some of they neighbors with 'em.  Then those neighbors would get more, or, or people on the job and when you know anything, we had a overflowing crowd there.  And, and after knocking on doors, talking to--every night talking to these people, then they would ask you--they start asking questions after I started with them.  You know if I--after I start talking, after that first night I didn't talk the first night.  And the next night when I did start, you know, they started asking questions you know, and telling you more, you know, really opening up to you.  So I guess they trusted--they learned to trust me and through me they figure well she probably wouldn't be with him, you know talking 'bout Jack [Macnamara].  So they got where they trusted him, you know, too.  You know and moving out there was smart move in order to get their trust, you know to get people's trust.
Story_ID: 192578
Speaker 1: Now tell me how, how did you get involved with Citizens Alert?  Now you--
Speaker 2: Okay.  We talked about '62 [1962], the, the Contract Buyers [League] was, you know, like--
Speaker 1: Seventy two [197], it was, yeah '72 [1972].
Speaker 2: I mean seven, '72 [1972].  Well anyway so Mary Powers, who I told you was with us at first with CBL, just a short while, very short while.  Well she knew me and she asked me did I wanna work for them, so I said yes.  I didn't have a job 'cause I was out of that one.  And I went, and I went down there and they hired me.  And I worked down there for about the same amount of time I had worked for CBL.
Speaker 1: Now what is Citizens Alert?
Speaker 2: Citizens Alert is a police, sort of watchdog group.  You see at the time, we were--you could read in the news about brutality, police brutality and all that.  So that's what we kind of was all about.  But what we needed, we felt is that the people in the communities that are the one that's suffering, should know more about the police and maybe work together instead of, you know, dividing, or here come the cops.  You know, that attitude.  And so we--they had what they call--what's that--the umbrella group and the Citizens' Alert is one under that.  But anyway, it's in here too, you'll see it.  But anyway they needed somebody to you know really do the meetings and things and fundraising and all that.  So that's when I really faced authorities like Cahill who was the commissioner over the Civil Service, did the hiring, you know the police and the fire department.  And that picture of me and Nancy Davis--I was asking--
Speaker 1: [Nancy] Jefferson, yeah.
Speaker 2: Jefferson I mean.  I was asking for psychological testing for all police applicants because it was so much brutality.  So I think you hiring people that shouldn't be hired as police officers.  And if they have the right test, psychological tests, the profession pers--professional person would be able to you know, weed 'em out and not let 'em get in there.  See a lot of people got on the police department not because of the pay or I just wanna look in this--I look nice in a uniform.  They got on there so they could get away with kicking folks' behind.  That's why they got on there.  The girl that died in--on the 17th of October in that fire in that County Building downtown, Maureen McDonald.  Did you--you remember reading that?
Speaker 1: That's recently.
Speaker 2: That's six people that died, well one of 'em name was Maureen McDonald.  She was with us.  She said some of the boys that she went to school, went to high school with, they told her that's why they was getting on.  'Cause she say she knew they had a chance to really get a good paying job, a decent job.  But they preferred the police department.  And she asked 'em why and they told her.  That's why they wanted to get in the police department.  And you got that kind down there, you know.  And so if you have psychological testing, maybe they could weed some out before they get in.  They may be smart, you know, but they, they--something wrong with their little brain.
Story_ID: 192579
Speaker 1: Now you had a meeting with Cahill [ph.], right where you--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had a, a meeting every so often.  I've forgotten whether it was every week or every month.
Speaker 1: The police board?
Speaker 2: No that, that's a different entity.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The police board.  This was about hiring, like personnel.  Police board was strictly 'bout police business.  So Cahill was the commission in charge of the hiring, you know.  And we were discussing that, trying to discuss it, but he seemed not to want to discuss it with me.  See you have to prove yourself to these, these people 'cause they think if I don't know you, then you're nobody.  But I say like this.  You are who you think you are.  If you feel that I'm somebody, then you somebody.  If, if the other fella doesn't feel the same way, that's his problem.  You know but you got to always think great of yourself, you know, that you're--so, so that's why he talked down to me like that.  But he was apparently a little bit not so nice all along.  Because his employees got too tickled and clapped they hands when I said what I did to him like he said something--
Speaker 1: Well what happened, tell us what happened 'cause we, we haven't told this on tape yet.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well an--anyway I--we were discussing about something about the psychological testing.  And I also was saying to him that--for him to explain, you know like for an example, if he say no, just flat no.  Then I wanna know why and, and, and I told him something that I had read or heard.  I don't know which one, I don't remember which one.  And he said you should never pay anything to people when you, when you coming out of these taverns and things.  And you heard that little sniggle go through the audience, you know.  So I thought I might as well set this boy--
Speaker 1: So his implication was that you--
Speaker 2: Was a drunk.  You know I'm coming out the tavern and I'm thinking I'm hearing things that are not there.  You know so he--you know that's what he--so he wanted--if the people--well you kind of know people.  They might believe this; they really--you know if you say something like that.  You know he really told her 'cause she drinks, you know they say that.  So I said to him not to judge me.  Don't y'all judge other people by yourself and your mother, what they do, what y'all do.  I--and I meant that because--but he stopped it.  See he didn't come on with, you know, with--after me like that anymore, you know.  I hate that.  I do.  I, I do not like hurting people, but I can hurt real bad.  But I don't like it.  I don't, I don't--you won't ever catch me being the front runner when it comes to being nasty with somebody or talking to people nasty.  I won't be--they'll have--when they start out saying something, you'll have to know--you'll know--well what did you do to her to--in order to get this reaction.  That's the way my older sister, or my sister next to me went and told them something I said to her or did to her, and my oldest sister said what you do--he just--she didn't ask about me.  She said what did you do to her?  'Cause she ain't gonna talk like that unless you, you got to push her over and then she'll, she'll come at you, you know.  She'll come after you.  But if you don't bother her, she's not gonna say things like that.  So that shut her up too.  But anyway Cahill was nicer after that, and they did come up with the psychological testing, you know after that.  But it wasn't--not that one visit or anything.

Speaker 1: See I would be there every time they would have a meeting.  They had to have a meeting every so often.  And I would be in there.  We could always check and find out what was going on, and so I'd be sitting up in there.  And he, he got where he knew me, I mean not personally but I mean he, he knew me when he saw me.  But he was nicer when I asked questions.  Then we left there and we did the police board.  They were having meetings, the police board.  But what the public didn't know that the public can attend those meetings, the board meetings.  But see they're not--they didn't do anything to notify the public that you supposed to sit in on these meetings if you want to, and you supposed to ask questions, you know.  Nobody--most people didn't know it, so that's what--after we found out they had done the research and we went to the meetings.  They were in a little room where they--and we told 'em we wanted to come to the meeting, they said no, they didn't have any space and nowhere for you to sit.  So the--we just kept going anyway.  You keep going, you keep talking.  And they finally start having board meetings in the auditorium where it should have been in the first place.  But the reason they didn't have it there is because they didn't want anybody there but the ones they, you know, the board.  And the, and the head of the, the--you know the police superintendent.  So anyway, they moved it into the auditorium and they I believe met once a month and I went, I wouldn't miss a month, not one.  I'd go to the meeting and I'd have my questions all ready before I got there.  But every time I would ask a question, (unclear) like I say, these authorities, these political authorities have their way of setting you down, you know don't wanna be bothered.  They don't wanna be questioned about certain things.  And I would ask my questions and he would dah, dah, dah, dah, next.  But without catching his breath.  You know he give me this little nothing answer, dah, dah, dah, dah, next.  That mean somebody else stand up and I would shut up.  I did that for--at first.  Then I was on my way down there one day and I told Dick, I said, "Look Dick."  I said, "You know how [James] Rochford always sitting me down?"  He said, "Yeah."  I said, "I'm not sitting down today."
Story_ID: 192581
Speaker 1: Now you were talking about how the, how Cahill [ph.] would--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --not, not Cahill.  This is the police superintendent, right.
Speaker 2: Rosford, [James] Rochford.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Superintendent James Rochford.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he would--
Speaker 2: He would sit me down each, each--
Speaker 1: By speeding up his answer and saying next before--
Speaker 2: And right away point to the other person that had they hand up.  That way, why I can't say anything 'cause the other person up talking, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So this particular day I told Dick, I said Dick I said you know what?  You notice how he does?  He said yeah I been noticing it.  I said well I'm not sitting down today.  And he was afraid to ask me, he told me later, what you gonna do?  See this is the thing.  They got two doors in and out of that auditorium, one in like back and the other one up here.  We normally come in that one.  Well anyway they got big ugly policemen standing there with big guns on at each door.  So that particular day, he says--he did the same thing, dah, dah, dah, next.  I said superintendent, I wouldn't sit down, I still--you had to stand up to speak, you know.  I said I haven't finished yet.  And then I went on and said what I had to say.  You know, ask him the other question or the half--other half of that one.  And then when he, he answered, you could have heard a pin fall in that auditorium.  In other words I'm sure the people were thinking she crazy.  Look at that big old ugly man standing right here with big guns on and she up there--I said I haven't finished.  I said you do that every month, I say but I have something to say and I was told that I should be heard.  And this policeman on this back door back there, start slowing moving up toward me.  And he must have waved him back.  I don't know, I didn't care.  I just wasn't gonna sit down.  I mean if you tell me I don't know the answer or I'm not gonna give you the answer, then I was sitting down and I get--come back later.  But I'm not sitting down at your dah, dah, dah, next.  And I--he never tried that again.  I went to the police board meeting many times since then.  And, and he tried to be funny one time, didn't nobody laugh.  One time I was talking, asking him a question and he--talking 'bout, "Y'all be quiet now, [HistoryMaker] Ms. [Ruth] Wells is speaking."  And didn't nobody laugh.  But I knew what he was doing, you know, but I kept speaking, you know.
Story_ID: 192582
Speaker 1: Did you ever hear of the Red Squad [Chicago Police Department's Subversive Activities Unit]?
Speaker 2: Yes ma'am, yes ma'am, Red Squad (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  It--they had the Red Squad watching us [contract Buyers League].
Speaker 2: Yeah, but a lot of people haven't heard of it, so we ought to tell 'em what it is.
Speaker 1: That was when they were really trying to find out about people's activities, the organizations and what have you.  They tried to infiltrate, they did infiltrate a lot of 'em.
Speaker 2: I think it was under the guise of trying to find out who's a communist.
Speaker 1: Right, under the--but they wanted to know what you was doing period.  Whether it was against or for the country, but something that you aren't supposed to be doing.  You know there are lot of things not against the country, but it's still a crime, you know, to do.  Well I--they--that, that's--I don't know what all their intentions were, but there were two police officers that visited us a lot and made friends, you know that type visiting when I was out at CBL [Contract Buyers League].  And they kept up with me when I went down to Citizens' Alert.  And well anyway this woman who was a volunteer, very good worker, very good--you'd have liked her personally, we found out was one of them.  Working right beside me.
Speaker 2: So this, this is a black woman?
Speaker 1: No, this a white woman.
Speaker 2: White woman, okay.
Speaker 1: But you know we had a lot of white volunteers and, and well there--in some cases when we have somebody on the payroll that was white.  But most of 'em were volunteers.  But she was strictly a (unclear).  She was one of them, she was spying for them.
Speaker 2: Did you ever have a chance to talk to her about it at some point?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  When they found out and told us, we got her the same day.  She didn't let down.  She still was trying to pump me.  You know I think I come cross to people like stupid.  I, I do.  I'm not, I'm not just saying that.  Because like her for an example.  Now I would have--every--the people were talking out loud right here where everybody 'round her just a little circle, know exactly what we talking about.  'Bout her being the spy, and shame on her.  She still wanted me to ride back to the office with her.  Well I didn't mind that, she ain't poison, and you done found out what she's about.  But she was still trying to pump me in the car back to the office.  She was still using little tricks to try to get me to tell her something.  And she--as far as I knew, she knew as much as I did.  'Cause you worked right beside me.  Anything I got, she got it.  But she was still trying.  So this is all involved with the police department and all.  Then she got, she, she left then after that, after they found out.  She didn't volunteer even more.  They even knew why she was volunteering.  But then she got--we would go to the police board in--
Speaker 2: Do you remember her name or what she called herself?
Speaker 1: No, I can't think of her name, I really don't.  I knew her real well, but she was like the ordinary housewife.  They said that's how a lot of the, the spies are--was successful.  They were all--worked as--what we thought was ordinary housewife.  They dress like it, they act like, they did everything like a, you know, somebody's wife 'round here that wasn't doing nothing but being a wife.  But they had other things up their sleeve.  But we--after we found out about her, she didn't come anymore because she was ashamed I guess.  But she didn't seem to be ashamed to me that day.  See those people that do these things think they are right.  And so why should I be ashamed about what I'm doing if I think I'm doing that which is right?
Story_ID: 192583
Speaker 1: Police officer I started to tell you about, that was with us, hung out with us at CBL [Contract Buyers League] and then they're the one they explain to me about like when we go picketing or going to set people back in when they--sheriff set 'em out.  They'll the ones would tell us about you better not fool around and go to jail, you know, get in prison.  'Cause it's all--every prison got a Big Mabel in there.  Big Mabel stands where she can see the new recruits when they come in, and she--whichever one she chooses, that's hers.  And say you don't have a choice like I don't wanna be both--involved in anything like that.  That doesn't mean anything.  If Big Mabel pick you, you involved.  You just automatically involved.  So you don't wanna--I don't know whether they was teasing or not.  But anyway, if they--like it's three or four coming in, she pick the one she like, you know.  That was that.  That type of thing they would tease us, well I wouldn't allow that to bother me too much 'cause I wasn't gonna do anything to actually go to prison.  Prison means you did a horrible crime of some sort.  I mean you may get locked up in jail, you may even be the wrong person that they're looking for.  But that's different from prison.  And so I thought, I said he didn't say anything about jail, he just said prison.  But they would try to frighten you knew about--you might end up in jail and know certain people couldn't stand it in jail, you know they couldn't--like this lawyer, [Robert William "Bob"] Ming.  See that was all I believe wrong with him 'cause he was doing fine till he went to jail.  He couldn't stand it--the idea of being locked up.  He's not that--he wasn't that type of person, but he didn't--I don't think he realized what a, a nasty person he was.  I don't think he realized that.
Speaker 2: So even though he was on, on your side, he just had--he had a mean personality.
Speaker 1: He, he, he--and he was a brilliant man.  You don't teach at Northwestern Law School just 'cause you a, a token black.  You don't--'cause you're teaching future lawyers.  And most of those are white guys that work with us were his student, ex-students.  He was a smart man and he the only one find a loophole where we could sue.  Those other guys didn't find it.  And we had, like I said, we had the guys from Jenner & Block and a lot of other big law firms downtown.  But he found it.  But he just had this, I don't know what kind of personality this is, that you--when you say anything come up, you know just like if I had--I'm wearing something that you think is horrible.  But you normally won't say, "Lady won't you take that off?  That's the ugliest dress I've ever seen."  You don't say that, you know.  You may think it, but you're not saying it.  Well he would say it.  He'd say whatever, whatever on his mind, he'd say it.
Story_ID: 192584
Speaker 1: How long were you with Citizens Alert until--
Speaker 2: Till about '76 [1976].  No, yeah, I guess '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Now I see you received an award from the Guardian Police Association, which is a black association, right?
Speaker 2: That's a black association.  Reverend, not reverend--Sergeant Lindsey [ph.] was the president of that group at the time and he worked closely with us.  His wife is--I don't know about right now, but his wife worked for Channel 2, she's a writer, Gladys [ph.].  You see her name on the thing, on the credits sometimes.  Gladys Lindsey.  But he, he's dead, the, the husband, he's dead.  But I remember when she was going to school, you know.  She was studying to become a writer.  And when I was working down at Citizens Alert.  And since then I see her name on the--I have seen her name on credits that she write for the CBS.
Speaker 1: Now are you, are you still involved?
Speaker 2: Not really.  Occasionally I go to some affair they have.  I didn't make it this time and I think it was 'cause they was on the 37th floor of the Sears Tower.
Speaker 1: The Citizens' Alert, okay.
Speaker 2: They had the party there at the--on the 37th floor.  And I didn't go and I haven't called Mary to give her my excuse yet.  I'm gonna send her a little, a little note.  You know I still go to different little functions, but I don't participate in any of that every day stuff, you know.  I'm too old and tired and I feel like I've done what I could do and it's time for the younger people to take charge, or to do something about the situation.
Story_ID: 192585
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community to you today?
Speaker 2: That one main--my main concern is loving one another.  I mean the type of love that Jesus spoke of.  The type of love that I wanna help you if I walk--whether I know you or not.  If I walk down the street and I see you need help, and whatever that little help you need, I know how, I can give it.  I wanna give it without being--having to be asked to do it.  If we ever learn to become a unit, united together, we'll be a hell of a people, you know that?  We got some brilliant minds and all of 'em don't have PhD's, but they got some very good minds.  But we wanna use them the wrong way.  So if we--that's what--the day that we learn to be and to live together like Dr. King tried to get us to do.  But we as a people, a black, the black race, must learn that first.  We got to learn how to live with one another.  And then we can expect or look forward to the world joining in, you know, every man and woman and child is just that, another man, or another woman, or another child.  Not the white man and the black man.  We'll, we'll never get there unless we first come together as one people.  We, we gonna have to do that.  Our churches, our schools, our homes, communities, the whole works.  Wherever we are, we got to learn to come together.
Story_ID: 192586
Speaker 1: When you look back on all your activities and in the community, are there any--is there anything that, that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: From what we did before?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, would you do anything different like now?
Speaker 2: I, I really don't believe so.  I believe that we did it--the right thing, the right way and at the right time.  It was time because things fell into place that I never thought or dreamed that I would see falling into place.  You know a lot of people are not aware that--I mean a lot of our people because they, they don't study black history.  You know they, they got to find out how it used to be before they can appreciate how it is.  You know if you don't know the past, the history--see that's important that we know the history of ourselves and our lives, how it used to be when we weren't even maybe born or old enough to understand these things.  If you look back and see how people were and how they did, then maybe you could come together now, you know.  This gen--not our generation or the next one, or--and the next one, you know, should be able to come together.  But that's my dream is that we as a people come together in true love and understanding of one another.  And try and be helpful like when I was a little kid in the South, people helped one another.  If I had a loaf of bread and you didn't have any, you got a half a loaf 'cause you gonna--I'm gonna give you half of mine.  But they left the South, came here and went crazy.  I don't know what happened, I really don't; I'd like to know what happened.  But that's the way it was.  Just like I was telling you about that pneumonia thing.  Those women--they weren't all relatives.  We had relatives there too, but they were just people who saw a person in need and they come.  And see those people would come and stay all night, sit up all night.  Let you take some sleep.  They would--that's, that's the kind of neighbors we were.  And I'm doing (unclear) I was thinking about how I was saying that--and they wouldn't touch nothing in your house.  And one of my little old sassy girlfriends, you didn't have nothing in there.  But you know a little humor along the way is okay.  But it was like--I mean they didn't; they didn't bother any, anything.  They'd help you with it, you know.  If they say well what--you don't have any milk in here, you know and you got little kids.  Somebody going somewhere and get you some milk and bring it in if they got any, you gonna get some too.  But see they--they would--but you ought to do like I do (laughter).  We got off the track somewhere.  But I know something is gonna put us back on the track, somebody, something is gonna put us back on.
Story_ID: 192587
Speaker 1: Now I, I had a friend, a good friend of mine who's a community organizer and he always--this is one of his favorite questions when he interviews people and I thought I'd ask it to you.  And that's just simply after all your community involvement, how do you feel about power?
Speaker 2: What you mean?  When someone that have power?
Speaker 1: Well how, how do you feel about power?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Power has a broad area I think.  I mean don't you think?  So I would like to know in what area.  Like people that are in power, they're all--they can pick up a phone and make a call and get things rolling.  Well that's good if the person that have the power has morals too.  Because see power can be and power can be terribly bad.  Because if a person don't have good morals and they got all this power, they gonna use it the wrong, in the wrong way.  They definitely gonna use it in the wrong way.  But if they are--if they have the proper morals.  I mean brought up properly to feel God and love man also, they--that power is wonderful.
Speaker 1: Okay, can the community have power?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes definitely.  But community got power and don't know it.  You see all they got to do as I said earlier about us banding together, if they will come together, that's power.  'Cause okay it wasn't the fact that we was--had all this power, you know we was bad or we knew all the answers; we didn't.  But so many of us came together and stuck it out.  And when they tell us when we go to set somebody back in after the sheriff done set 'em out, they say you all know we may end up in jail.  So a group got together and got bail money and put it aside.  But we never had to use it.  That's power.  See 'cause you know normally if the sheriff, that's the law, come and set you out, you stay out of there.  No, we wait till they leave.  We respected 'em, but we gonna put the furniture, stuff back in the house.  People gone back doing what they was doing.  And, and they knew we did it.  They didn't have to say well I, I wonder who that--we got to catch who did, that they knew who did it, but they didn't bother us.  They talked about us, but they didn't really come and put us in jail or anything for putting the people back in.  Now that's--we had power because togetherness gives you power.  But divided, nothing divided works right.  It's just not gonna work right.  But see we got together and we stuck together till the end.  And we--that gave us power.
Story_ID: 192588
Speaker 1: What would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I--maybe standing up to that lawyer.  You know that--my lawyer had--supposed to have had, supposed to have hired.  Standing up to him.  I would like people to (unclear) people like I was, you know real--kind of don't talk much and when I'm talking, didn't speak loud.  Well to know that there--they have a voice too.  If somebody is pushing you around for any reason, you stand up to 'em, whoever it is.  I would like for that, maybe to put that on my tombstone.  If you believe it, fight for it.
Story_ID: 192589
Speaker 1: Is that how you, you'd like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And see you, you can overcome all of these fears and like I was you know real meek and humble.  I was, I, I know that I was.  But I'm not so--underneath I'm not so meek and definitely not humble, you know.  But sometime it takes something to rile me up.  I don't like going around, you know just because okay we spoke of power.  You don't misuse power.  When you do, you get into trouble.  Well I know that I'm not a 'fraidy cat like I used to be.  And CBL [Contract Buyers League] started it all, brought it out and made me speak out.  And when I was afraid, I spoke anyway.  And I wouldn't be afraid.  I have stood up, like I say, I think in front of 'round--we had a re--no that wasn't a reunion.  About down here at this Pavilion that I was speaking at, that place was full.  And they only gave me a few seconds.  But I said what I went to say.  And I seen the time when I had to learn, for the example, if I knew you were in the audience, I say boy I don't wanna goof up in front of him.  You know, I don't wanna--well see when I start thinking like that, I got to remember when I face the audience and I'm ready to speak, look above everybody's head and everybody think you looking at them.  Move your head around a little bit, like slowly, and they think you looking at them.  You look like you're looking at them.  You're looking above they head.  See if you--if I look you in the face, if you're smiling I think well maybe he like what I'm saying.  If you're not smiling, uh-oh, then that, that makes me nervous, see.  But if I look over your head and never look you in the face, I don't care what you thinking.  You thinking what you thinking, but I can't do anything about it anyway.  So therefore why should I look and agitate myself?  I'll just look over your head, I won't look--see a lot of time you get up to speak, you're looking at the audience and, and, and you're not--someone will hit your right in the eye that you didn't even have a dream they were there.  But your face--uh-oh.  So then I just got where I would--when I go up to speak, I don't look at anybody, nobody.  But everybody think I'm looking at them, but I'm not looking at anybody.  And that's one of the things I learned.  I had to learn that because as I told you, it wasn't but just a handful of people in there that first night that I spoke.  But I was still shaking, my knees was actually trembling.  I was weak in the knee when I sat in there, but I held onto a chair and, and went on and talked.  So once I went through that, other things would come to you, what to do and how to do.
