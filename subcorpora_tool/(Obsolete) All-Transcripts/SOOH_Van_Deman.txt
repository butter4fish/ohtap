 Little Thunder  Van Deman  This is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is January 15, 2013, and  I   m interviewing Jim Van Deman as part of the Oklahoma Native Artists  Project, sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at  Oklahoma State University. We   re at Jim   s studio in Oklahoma City,  actually in Bethany. Jim, you   re a Delaware tribal member from the  Anadarko area. You started out as a graphic designer, but in 1990 you  turned to art full-time. Your style often alternates between  Impressionism and abstraction, which had you swimming against the  commercial Native art current for a while. Since then you   ve become a  well-known figure on the Native art scene, not just for your paintings but  also for the Native flutes that you make. Thank you for taking the time to  speak with me.  Thanks, glad to do it.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  Anadarko. Graduated from high school there in 1961, which means that  I grew up in Anadarko through the    50s, which was a really, really fun  time. Anadarko was a really safe town at that time, and we spent a lot of  time going to the theater on Saturday for twenty-five cents, eating ten-cent  popcorn. (Laughter) It was a good time in Anadarko.  The Delaware tribe is one of the two Delaware tribes in the state. One of  them is in Anadarko, and one of them is near Bartlesville. The Anadarko  tribe has been there since 1859 or so. Well, the Delawares moved to the  Oklahoma area in a roundabout fashion from the East Coast through  Ohio, through Kansas, to Anadarko. Sometime in the middle 1800s, part  of the tribe split off and went to Tyler, Texas, and then came back to  Anadarko, and they were known as the Absentee Delawares. That   s the  group that   s there now, and they are now the Delaware Nation.  5  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  What did your mom do for a living?  She worked at Riverside for a number of years, the Indian school...  Riverside Indian School?     yes, in Anadarko, and retired from there and worked in various tribal  functions for the Delawares as their AOA  Administration on Aging   director for a number of years, then finally retired from that.  What about your grandparents on either side? Did you have any contact  with them?  Oh, yes. My grandmother is my tribal connection. She is, let   s see, the  great-great-granddaughter of Black Beaver, a very famous Delaware.  Both tribes, the Bartlesville tribe and the Anadarko tribe, claim relation  to Black Beaver, and I   m his third-great-grandson, three-great, through  my grandmother. There is direct historic connection to prove it.  That   s cool. So you knew your grandmother and went out and spent time  at the house?  Oh, yes. She actually lived with us.  What are your earliest memories of making art?  I remember in Anadarko this guy named Acee Blue Eagle, and there   s  still a guy there named Rance Hood. Those two guys were influential on  my artwork in the beginning, but then I had a great opportunity with a  graphics manufacturing company for about ten years to travel all over  the United States. With that traveling, I got to visit most of the major  museums east of the Mississippi, influences from Monet and Renoir,  those guys. My artwork, even though it   s abstract, is kind of loosely  always based on landscapes and the impressionists. They start out that  way, and then they end up abstract. (Laughter)  Did you like to draw when you were younger? Did you experiment with  art when you were younger?  I was one of those guys that drew up the margins of his books. (Laughs)  They were like two or three of us in my class in Anadarko, and two of us  actually grew up to be artists.  Who was the other one?  Billy Henderson.  6  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Were any other members of your family or extended family artistic?  No.  Going back to your memories, I guess, of Acee Blue Eagle, was his work  some of the first Native art that you saw?  Yes, and actually I have a relative who was kin to Blackbear Bosin, too,  and I saw his artwork as well, a very refined artist.  What attracted you to Blue Eagle   s work or Rance Hood   s work?  All the artists in Anadarko at the time were doing the flat, posterized,  outlined artwork that   s become kind of characteristic of the area, and  they   re still doing it there. My artwork started out being the same way. I  majored in art at Southwestern  Oklahoma State University  in  Weatherford, had a double major in fine art and commercial art. At the  time, there was just a terrific watercolor artist there, Ken Watson, and  there was a terrific abstract artist there, George Calvert. Those two were  very influential. I think George won because I   m doing abstracts now.  (Laughter)  You mentioned even in school you were drawing on your books and you  knew you were interested in art. Did you get encouragement from your  teachers?  No. There was no art class, no art anything in Anadarko at the time.  Understand, that was probably about 1941 and    2 and    3. World War II  was just over, so we were drawing airplanes and tanks. (Laughter)  So even up through high school, really no encouragement or anything?  Well, let   s say no opportunities.  No opportunities, yes. Were you thinking of yourself as being an artist?  Did I know I was going to be an artist? Yes, that   s where I was headed.  Okay, at a young age.  Yes, and I happened to hit Southwestern at a really good time with the  instructors there.  Let   s talk about the base you got at Southwestern, first.  7  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  I was going to say what happened at Southwestern was   in the class of     61, there was probably about twenty guys and some girls there as well.  Almost all of us made our careers. Out of twenty or twenty-two, I would  say probably twelve or fifteen ended up being artists of one sort or  another.  Yes, that   s a real tribute to the teachers. So what kinds of skills did you  come away with from Southwestern?  Well, I forgot to mention Richard Taflinger. Richard Taflinger was the  head of the Art Department at the time. In his drawing classes and basic  art for freshman year, basic art and figure drawing and the art classes,  Richard taught us composition and hammered it into our heads. He was  kind of an old-school, Italian guy. Let   s see. Our education would   ve  been formal, I guess you would say, in that you didn   t get by with not  paying attention to composition. Then color balance came later with  George Calvert.  And were you working in acrylics at that point?  No, acrylics     They were newer.  I was there four or five years, and I think about the third year, acrylics  started showing up as a possible art form we knew nothing about. I was  painting with oils and watercolor at the time.  Were any of your teachers interested in abstract art?  Yes, George Calvert was an abstract artist, probably more on the  expressionist end of it than true non-objective abstract. He really was the  guide into color balance, where Taflinger was teaching composition.  Those two things now today are the main thing. The two elements that I  dwell on in my paintings is composition and the color balance.  So you really probably hadn   t been exposed to a lot of abstract art prior  to Southwestern?  Actually, abstract art in the    50s was kind of a popular thing, and yes,  checking out art books from the college library is pretty good exposure  for a lot of work. Here in later life, I   ve been accused of borrowing from   Mark  Rothko a little, but that   s really not true. I like Rothko   s work,  but my work is quite a bit different. (Laughs)  So after college, what happened? You had your double major.  8  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  What happened is I got married, and we had a baby, and we moved to  Oklahoma City, and I began work for a company called Central Sales  Promotion. That   s a screen printing company, and they had a department  of production artists, of which I was one. I worked in that capacity for  six or seven years and then as a designer for the company with my own  set of accounts that I was designing store trims for, seasonal store trims  and interior things. (Laughs)  Were you also painting, doing artwork on the side?  The Oklahoma Art Guild, I got involved with them in about    67, and  they kept the fine art side of me going, so I was never that far from being  in the fine arts.  So they would have shows and     Yes, monthly meetings. Mostly at the time we were all Sunday painters  and stuff, but we   d have two or three big shows a year.  Was Bert Seabourn a member of that guild?  Yes.  Is that how you first became acquainted with him?  Yes, I   ve known Bert since    67,    68, sometime back then.  Can you tell us a little bit about how you met?  Well, when I met Bert, he was still working for ONG, I think. I don   t  know what his job was with ONG, but he might have been Art Director  or something for them. Nice guy, known him for years. I admire his  work.  And like you said, both of you having to sort of do other things to  support yourselves but wanting to do more painting. Did you get  anything from the job, any kinds of skills that you think later on would  manifest themselves in your art when you began painting full-time?  Probably the influence from the Art Guild and being around other artists.  The Art Guild had pretty close to a hundred members at the time. I don   t  know what it has now, but back then it was between eighty and a  hundred members. The conversations were about art, doing art, and then  we actually were doing art. I   ve gone through the phases from really  tight landscapes, through impressionist landscapes, and then finally  9  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  settling on abstract art. It took me a while to realize that not everybody  can do an abstract painting.  In the Art Guild one year I had the opportunity to do a workshop, and I  had sixteen people sign up for it. It was a week long, and of the sixteen  people, two understood the process, my process, of doing abstract art.  That is that you   ve got this big blank canvas and you approach it with a  blank mind. You don   t worry about what goes on the canvas. You just  start it off, and it ends up. (Laughs) I think there were two guys in there,  and the rest of them were ladies. Almost all of them needed something  to think about before they started on the canvas. I never actually ever  worried about that.  And what year was this?  Oh, gosh. That   s been probably thirty years ago.  Did you also take workshops when you were a member of the Guild?  Yes. In fact, I took one from Mike Larsen. I took one from Diane  Ainsworth McDonald, I think was her name. I can   t think of her last  name. I took one in Taos from William Hook, who is a very well-known  acrylic painter. He and I have two totally different styles. I took it to see  if I could pick up any acrylic painting secrets from him, and sure enough  there are none. (Laughter) I knew probably a few, and he knew a few. It  wasn   t my idea to go in and emulate his work. It was just mainly try to  advance in acrylic painting as a media.  You mentioned Diane Ainsworth McDonald as an influence. What kind  of things did you draw from her?  Diane is from   is her last name McDonald? Do you know her?  No, I researched her for your interview. I think it   s Ainsworth  McDonald.  Okay, I thought it was, but it   s been a while since I   ve thought about her.  She   s from Taos and a really skilled impressionist landscape painter. I  still like impressionist landscape painting, and I still dabble around in it,  but as far as showing my artwork, like with Red Earth and in galleries,  it   s going to be abstracts.  So you did have the opportunity when you were traveling, as you  mentioned, to see a lot of artwork? Can you sort of describe for us  maybe one of those pivotal moments?  10  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Yes, it was. (Laughter) It was arrogance at its highest form. (Laughs) I  caught a Monet show at the Chicago Art Institute. It was the traveling  show, and I happened to be in town at the same time that the show was  there. There was, like, huge rooms just full of Monet paintings and one  wall   there was 180 haystacks on one wall that he had painted during  different times of the day to, I guess, get the light right.  I   m standing and looking at one of his pieces thinking,    I can do that.     Of course, there   s no way in the world I could do that, but that   s really  kind of what got me started painting. I   ll say this about Monet and  Renoir and all those impressionist paintings. When you   re looking at  them in a museum as opposed to looking at them in a book, they are two  totally different things. The colors are alive in the museum, especially  Renoir pieces.  Did it open up   had you done a lot of plein air painting? Did that  become an interest of yours for a while?  Plein air painting took a nosedive in Sedona. (Laughs) I set up out there.  One time my wife and I were vacationing there. I set everything up,  squirted my paint out on the pallet, turned around and adjusted my  canvas, turned back around and all the paint was dry. It was like you had  to work it like a watercolor. Your paint had to be thin, water thin, and  you got it on canvas and then finished up later. I would assume plein air  painting with acrylics would be that way. I don   t do it. (Laughs) I don   t  do it anymore.  This was what year that you sort of tried that? Do you remember?  That was probably in the    80s, probably about    88, as a matter of fact.  So in 1990 you decided to go full-time with your art. What sort of  brought that decision on?  I resigned from the graphic arts company I was working for, the  manufacturers, and worked around for a couple years trying to get  something going. Nothing got going, and so I just leaned back on what I  knew and started painting full-time. I was lucky enough to draw a  gallery north of Scottsdale in the Boulders  Resort . It was just a  tremendous gallery, and over the fourteen years that I was there, we sold  lots of artwork.  What was the name of the gallery?  Es Posible, It   s Possible. It was owned by June Gilliam, a woman from  Stillwater. Do you know June?  11  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  I don   t.  Oh. You need to meet her.  So did you just walk in with some paintings one day? How did that     She picked me up at Red Earth, actually. She was coming through the  Red Earth show. I   ve been at Red Earth shows for fifteen years, and she  came through one year and liked my artwork. We had a business  relationship for quite a number of years.  That   s wonderful. So did she do any solo shows for you?  No, but within the gallery (the gallery was huge) there was one room  that they called the Van Deman room because it was all my work.  (Laughs) That was one of my highlights for my career. Oh, and one of  the other highlights is out of that I got an eight-foot-by-eight-foot  commission to go in an 8,000-square-foot home up in the Boulders. That  was quite a deal.  Yes, wonderful commission. So you did your first Red Earth show in  1990, actually, the first year that you started painting full-time?  Probably so. That   s probably about right.  How was the show for you?  That   s probably more about    95 or    96.  About    95, okay. You had attended the show a little bit previous to that?  Oh, yes. They celebrated an anniversary just recently, but I don   t know  which one. Was it twenty-five? Yes, I think I was at the first one  downtown.  Yes, at the Myriad Center. What was your reception like the first time  you did the first Red Earth show?  Better than you might think for abstracts. (Laughter) I also had some  pretty interesting-looking, I think, expressionist pieces there, which were  animals that were   I had a series of paintings of birds dressed like  Indians instead of Indians dressed like birds. One of those sold. It was  about a  3,700 painting, first or second year. I can   t remember. It kind of  boosted my ego a little bit for being in those shows.  12  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Did you have a title for it? Was it a series, sort of, per se?  I think I just called it The Birds, and it was actually birds dressed in  Native American regalia.  Right, sounds interesting.  I   d like to see that painting again. (Laughter)  When did you enter your first competitive show?  Probably in 1990. There used to be a show, (and may still be down at  McAlester) and the pieces I took there were all Anadarko-style artwork  pieces.  That is to say, you   re saying flat style?  Yes.     Traditional.     On illustration board. I was trying to think of the type. They   re not  gouache. Well, they   re kind of like gouache paints, which is a flat, more  like egg tempera, actually. There   s a company called Pelikan that made a  group of colors called Designer Colors, and that   s what I painted with. I  probably had, I don   t know, ten or twelve pieces. Sold about half of  them.  Wow   Of course, I was getting like fifty dollars a painting back then, too. A  little different now. (Laughter)  But still, when you   re able to sell flat style, but then you sort of take this  chance on going a different direction     You asked me about workshops. I had a workshop with Doc Tate  Nevaquaya. Doc Tate is the one that got me out of that style because he  did a demonstration. That one went for three or four days, too, or  evenings, and it was at Putnam City. With his demos, when he did them,  he would go through everything that you   d need to do. It all had to be  real, and it all had to be traditional. I   m going,    I don   t know any of that  stuff. I just make them up as I go along,    and so I got out of it.  (Laughter)  I think a lot of those artists like Rance Hood and Doc Tate and  13  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Blackbear Bosin and all those other guys, Acee, really did concentrate  on the traditional side of stuff. They knew what went in all the dance  regalia, what went on the horses, and what kind of spear he was  carrying, and the feathered staff had to be just exactly right. I don   t  know that stuff. (Laughs)  They were focused on the cultural content.  Exactly.  Did you ever do the Eiteljorg  Museum of American Indians and  Western Art  show?  No. I have an invitation lying on my desk at home now for it, but I   m  not going to do it this year, either. (Laughter)  What about an early award that was important to you?  One year I won Best of Show at the Art Guild show, the main one for  the year, and then I   ve won several awards for Red Earth, one of them  on a flute that I made, which, by the way, was stolen two weeks from  Christmas from Red Earth gift shop. It   s gone. (Laughs) That was  probably, among my flutes, my masterpiece.  Heartbreaking.  Well, it   s like, let   s see, D. G. Smalling, we were at a get-together a  week or so ago, and he said,    You   ve reached a plateau when you   re an  artist and some of your work has been stolen.    (Laughter)  That   s a kind of ironic recognition, isn   t it? I think you also had a  gallery in Sedona, Goldenstein Gallery?  Yes, Goldenstein. It   s probably the best gallery in Sedona, but Sedona is  a tourist town and not an art town. People do not buy big paintings and  carry them around. I was there for four years, and we pulled out. I say     we,    my partner and I, Doris, my wife.  What was enjoyable about that show the first time, the first time you  went out there?  In Sedona? Being in Sedona. You   ve been there. It   s a beautiful place.  Every direction you look is a vista, and being in the best gallery in town,  too, was pretty cool. When June Gilliam closed the gallery in the  Boulders, she set all of the artists up that were with her in that gallery up  in Sedona. We had our choice of about two or three different galleries.  14  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  She did her homework. Beautiful lady. Anyway, I chose the Goldenstein  Gallery, and it just really didn   t work out.  What aspects of the art business did you find especially challenging  when you started full-time?  People turning loose of big money. (Laughs) It   s a funny thing, but you  can hold a painting for two years, and then all of a sudden somebody  will come along and buy it. It   s not that people don   t like it. It   s just it   s  got to be the right person for the right particular painting. The economy  plays a role in whether artwork sells or not, as well, expendable cash or  something.  Right, right, because, for example, in the Sedona Gallery, I know they  had the Cowboys and Indians show. Did you notice a difference in the  pricing structure between Native art and western art?  Not so much between, say, Sedona and the gallery Es Posible at the  Boulders. The pricing was pretty much the same there. Between there  and here, the pricing is different. You have to lower the prices here in  Oklahoma somewhat.  What changes have you observed in the Native art landscape since the     90s?  There are more guys doing abstract artwork than there was when I  started, and I   m glad. I   m proud of them for pursuing it. Even when I  first started, there were a couple of guys (I can   t think of their names  right offhand) that were major abstract artists, Native American abstract  artists. Fritz Scholder, to start off with one, and I believe, Nieto. Nieto?  John Nieto.  Yes, was doing coyotes and buffalos, yes, in odd colors. I wouldn   t call  them abstracts, particularly. They   re more expressionist works.  Do you get to interact with some of the other abstract artists these days  at shows?  Being an older guy at the show now, yes, the young ones will kind of  talk to me some. (Laughter) I kind of like that. (Laughs)  What role does your wife play in the art business?  Supporting me, and she   s one of my biggest fans, so that helps. (Laughs)  15  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  It does. It   s kind of a lonely business sometimes. When did you first  become interested in Native flute?  I don   t know when I made the first flute, but I can tell you I   ve made  about 120 of them since I first started. If I can, I   ll just reach right here  and grab one?  You   re welcome to.  Okay, this flute is not a copy but a representation of flutes from the  Anadarko area in the early 1900s. Now, as I get my flute history from a  guy named Doc Payne, who died several years ago, (Doc Payne was a  flute collector and a flute expert) is that flutes really in this style don   t  go back much past 1850. There are some ancient Anasazi flutes, but  they   re not this type of flute. A guy named Coyote Oldman (his name is  Michael Allen) says that he   s the first guy that put a pentatonic minor  scale to a Native American flute, and he may be. That happened in the  early    60s.  Flutes are very basic. Start at one end, (plays flute) five notes, and  there   s six with an octave. This one is one piece. A lot of flutes are in  two pieces where there is a seam, and they   re glued. This one is bored  from each end and then finished from there. A guy named Belo Cozad  from Anadarko is producing a short, big-bore flute similar to this one,  and so this flute is kind of styled after his flutes. I don   t think the Cozad  flute had an actual scale. It had a scale, but it wasn   t a western music  scale that we   re used to hearing. Probably if we heard him play it, it  would be a little dissonant.  That   s beautiful wood. What kind of wood is that?  This piece right here is actually from Geary, Oklahoma. It   s giant red  cedar.  Cedar, yes. Were you aware of Woodrow Haney   s work with flutes or  Doc Tate   s work with flutes?  Doc Tate   s, yes. Woodrow, not so much.  Did you and Doc visit a little bit about flutes when you     Actually, by the time I got to flutes, Doc was gone. I do have some of  his CDs and recorded music by he and his sons. I have, actually, a fairly  good collection of flute music on CD.  Wow, that   s neat. So when you started making flutes   why don   t you  16  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  take us through the process of making your first one?  I   ve got the first one. (Laughter) It   s right here. This is prototype 001,  and it   s not in a pentatonic minor scale. (Plays flute) From there, I  actually worked out the pentatonic minor scale for myself, and then I  met Doc Payne, Dr. Payne. I can   t remember his first name. I think  Richard. He said,    That   s a pentatonic minor,    and I   m going,    Okay?     (Laughter)  So was it an accidental discovery?  It was. It was accidental in that I was shooting for the way I heard the  flutes being played on CD at the time. Who was that first guy? I think it  was Nieto, wasn   t it?  Nakai? Are you talking about Carlos Nakai?  Nakai, Carlos Nakai. I wanted my flute to sound like his flute, and so it  was just my ear adapting that scale. I knew nothing about a pentatonic  minor scale at the time. I know a lot about it now, but not then. Anyway,  just that   s the way it developed: me by ear and drilling holes until I got  them in the right place.  Right. So your first flute, which sounds like a Native flute that we   re  used to hearing, when you learned to play, did you learn to play a  number of different songs from the area, or did you sort of start creating  your own songs?  You know, I never really thought about those songs being actual songs  because they   re from the 1850s. I just thought you picked up a flute and  played what I call flute licks. (Laughs) You listen to Carlos Nakai, and  there   s certain things that he does in a song to get the song to start in one  place and end up another. To me they   re just kind of flute licks, and so  you just string all these flute licks together, and you   ve got a song.  So there wasn   t anybody you knew, either, in the area that knew about  Delaware flute songs or anything?  As far as I know, I   m the only Delaware flute guy there is. I do not know  if there are any more flute makers, and I don   t think so. Most of the flute  players in Oklahoma are, what, Comanches and Kiowas maybe.  Plains tribes.  Yes, Plains tribe guys.  17  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  So when you developed a pentatonic     Minor.     minor    (Laughs)  It   s a five-note scale. That   s why    penta.        what kinds of possibilities did that open up?  Well, every flute I   ve made since I developed the scale has been a  pentatonic minor. Almost all flutes   I can   t say all flutes because  Tommy Ware from Anadarko is a flute player and he plays a diatonic.  That   s a chromatic-scale flute. What I can say about that is if you   re  going to play    Amazing Grace    you need a diatonic flute because it   s  difficult to play on a pentatonic flute. Tommy plays a lot of    Amazing  Grace    at a lot of funerals, so he plays a diatonic flute. (Laughs)  Did you have a music background at all before you started?  Yes.  Oh, you did. Okay.  I started playing trumpet in fourth grade and played all the way through  three years of college, so I was well-based in music. Then I got married,  and the trumpet went by the wayside, and I picked up guitar. I   ve been  playing guitar for quite a number of years. I ought to be a whole lot  better than what I am.  And making some instruments, too, which I   d like to talk about a little  bit, but first let me ask you, do you ever perform on the flute, or do you  just play for yourself? Are you more interested in creating them?  I   m more interested in creating and playing them for myself. On  occasion, I have performed with other players, but it always makes me a  little nervous. (Laughs)  You   ve also experimented with some other   they   re both artistic  creations and instruments. Can you kind of talk about those a bit?  Well, I got into cigar box guitars quite a number of years ago, too.  I   ve made about sixty of those. Recently, I gave one to Kyle Dillingham.  Do you know Kyle? He   s a well-known Oklahoma fiddle player. He and  I see each other on occasion, and I made one for him. I don   t know  whether it will show up in his work or not. They play pretty well.  18  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Yes, because I was wondering, is your primary interest the sound that  they have     Yes.     or is it sort of the look to them.  Here   s how they look, and here   s how they sound. (Plays)  That sounds very nice.  So it   s really not a kid toy. I think it sounds   it   s got a great sound, and  it has possibilities. Most of them are electric. They   ll plug right into an  amp.  If you have the same size box, is it pretty much the same sound, or does  it really vary?  No, in fact, they vary even if you have the same size box. Every one of  them is different. They all sound     They all have a unique voice.  Yes, they have a unique voice is a good way to put it.  How did you get the idea to do that?  I think that I might have picked up off the internet, but at the time there  wasn   t much there. Now, these days, there   s everything you need to  know about a flute, and there   s everything you need to know about cigar  box instruments on the internet. My latest I don   t have here, (I wish I  did) is a Taos hand drum that has a banjo neck on it, and it sounds  terrific. I wish I had it here to play for you. (Laughter)  That sounds really interesting. Basically when you were experimenting  with the flute the first time, you were sort of reinventing the wheel, trying  to figure out how to make your first flute. Is that right?  Yes. I bought a flute from a guy named Billy Wells in Edmond, and his  flute is sort of in a pentatonic minor scale, but it   s off. There are several  notes that are quite a bit flat. There   s a song in every flute, no matter  how it   s tuned. I mean, you could take a hollow tube and get it to blow  like a flute and poke holes in it, and you can play a song. I   m not much  of a stickler on it being tuned to perfection.  19  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Anyway, Billy Wells built a beautiful flute, and I didn   t necessarily copy  it. In fact, I didn   t copy it at all. I just worked from it, listening to it and  Carlos Nakai   s CDs, and that   s how it came. I forgot about Billy   s flute  a while ago or I would   ve mentioned it.  You had a two-person show at Red Earth in 2011 with Lisa Rutherford,  is that right, the potter?  Yes.  How many paintings did you put into the show?  About twelve.  Were they all new pieces?  They were all new and some that had been around to other shows.  What are the benefits of being able to do a two-person show like that?  The benefits is I sold one piece and picked up two commissions out of  that show, so that was a pretty good deal. We had a very, very nice  turnout for the reception. I was real pleased with the Red Earth  management and what they did for the show.  Well, great. How important are commissions to your work? How much  of a percentage of your income are commissions?  These days not so much as, say, ten years ago. I   ve got two that I should  be working on right now and will be, starting tomorrow. (Laughter)  Are they from a previous show last year?  Actually, one is a true commission, and the other one is from friends.  You know, is a friend really a commission? (Laughter) I don   t know  how you can look at that, but it   s money.  Have you taught? You mentioned the one class that you taught for the  Guild, but have you taught any other classes or workshops, either in  painting or instrument making?  No.  Any interest?  Actually, being in this studio here, I   m pretty isolated, and I rarely see  20  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  people or talk to people. I belong to a radio-control flying club in  Yukon, and so I see those guys once a week or every two weeks. Other  than that, I don   t see many people here unless I   m doing a show like Red  Earth, which is nonstop talking for three days. It   s kind of an interesting  existence.  And you mentioned you   d had this studio here in Bethany for     Fourteen, fifteen years, yes. I   ve been here for a long time.  What project are you working on now that you   re especially excited  about?  Well, I   m pretty excited about the two commissions and the hand drum  banjo. I   ve got four hoops back there and the rawhide, and I   m going to,  instead of using a drum from the Taos Drum Company, I   m going to  make my own. I   d like to get the head a little tighter than what   s on the  Taos drum. That interests me greatly. I   m going to get on those. I hope  to have about three of them for the Red Earth show in June.  That   s still your principal booth show.  Now, this is interesting in that Red Earth likes them. I thought the  management there would go,    What connection do you Native  Americans have with banjos, anyway?    But I get such a positive  response from them that they   re glad to have me show them.  Right, they   re unique. Let   s talk about your techniques and process a bit.  In terms of paintings, you no longer work in oils and watercolors. It   s  primarily acrylics.  It is 100 percent acrylic, and I use a lot of pure colors. They   re all  layered many times with thin washes, rather than   well, I do mix a lot  of colors on the palette and mix them up in jars ahead of time. I   m kind  of guilty of using color straight out of the tube, too, because they   re so  close to bead colors. A lot of my abstract work is based on bead colors  and blanket colors and those blanket combinations of colors like the  Kiowa sunburst, which is used a lot in their necklaces that starts with  white, yellow, orange, red, and blue, I think, and those colors both  directions. You will find that a lot in my work if you look close enough.  When you   re looking at a blank canvas, rather than approaching it with  a composition in mind from the start, you have this repertory of colors  that you know are going to come into play some way?  Actually, I start with two colors on a canvas, and that is Raw Sienna and  21  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Prussian Blue in the Liquitex color. Those two, when you mix them  together, can go all the way from a cool color to a warm color. Using  them really thin, you get all the way from brown through green to blue.  Those go up on the canvas with a wide brush, and we just kind of wash  it up there, paying attention to the golden mean.  If I remember this correctly, there   s four points on your canvas where  you want your center of composition to be, so I work around one of  those four points and just keep the color coming up until I go,    Aha, it  needs this here, and needs that there.    Actually, it   s a feedback from the  canvas telling me what it needs. That   s about the best I can do with that.  (Laughs)  Do you work straight through, or do you like to let canvases sit in  various stages?  Since I   m working, I   ll get it going, and I can get a canvas pretty well  done in about three hours, but then it might take two or three weeks to  finish it because of the thin overlays or thin washes. If you put a thin  wash on, you can   t go back in, say, ten or fifteen minutes on top of it or  the water will rewet it and open it up. It has to sit for a day or two, and  then you can go back and work on top of it. Sometimes they stretch out  for weeks until I get them to where I like them.  Do you give titles to your paintings?  Funny thing about titles, (Laughs) they   ll get a title, and then they   ll go  to a show, and I   ll forget what the title was, so they get renamed for the  next show unless I   ve got it written on the back. Sometimes I do. Titles  are kind of important, and I   ve gone through everything from titling it to  what it looks like to titling it to what it doesn   t look like. I had two  paintings, one of them named Not Sedona and one of them named Not  Santa Fe. I   ll title them for what they   re not. (Laughs) Then I went into  cyber titles with dots for a while, and now I   m back to maybe opening a  dictionary, pointing a finger, and saying,    Aha     I   ve done that for titles.  (Laughter)  Why are titles important?  I   ve often wondered that. You see a lot of paintings untitled. I don   t like  that either. I think it should have some title, and maybe it should relate  to the painting or not. Maybe it shouldn   t be obverse to the painting.  Is it more an expectation that both the artist has and viewer has?  It   s more of an expectation of a client or a viewer that a painting should  22  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  have a name. Well, you go in museums, and all paintings are named  even if it is Untitled One.  As an abstract artist or even when you   re approaching something  impressionistically, what role then does sketching play in your work?  Actually, the wash is the sketch. I used to do a lot of sketching in books.  I still do that occasionally, but only if I have a character or something in  mind that   s going to go on canvas. Otherwise, the wash is the sketch.  So, for example, I saw a few nice crow paintings in here, so those would  be a sketch in a book first?  This one back here was very specific and went through several sketches  until I got the crow looking like an actual crow.  Do you keep a notebook of ideas or titles?  I did. Not much anymore. You reach a certain point where you kind of  know what   s going to happen. There are some watercolor artists. Ken  Watson was one, and   I can   t think of his name. Anyway, they   ll prep  their paper, and those guys know exactly what   s going to happen when  they touch the brush to the paper. In forty-five minutes they have a  finished piece because they knew from the very beginning what it was  going to be. That doesn   t necessarily happen with me. (Laughs)  What kinds of research do you do for your paintings?  In the beginning I did a lot of research on the Delaware tribe and the  various aspects of it since they came to Oklahoma and before. I do some  abstracts that are just kind of mainstream abstracts, but then I also do a  series usually for Red Earth that will be based on spirituality. There   ll be  spirit characters floating through the abstract somewhere if you look  close enough. I   m kind of fascinated with a character called Mesingw.  With the Delawares he was, I should say it was an animal spirit. Like  this guy back here could be a mesingw of a crow.  So you   ve been exploring that theme a little bit?  Yes, pretty much, even in writing. I   ve been doing some writing, so the  characters show up in my stories.  That   s interesting. How did you come up with your signature?  That   s funny because our instructors in college had us work on  signatures. I have two. I have one that   s script, and I have one that goes  23  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  on the paintings.  When you say script, that   s just     Like signing my check.  Oh, I see. Okay. But, yes, it   s an art, sort of.  Yes, well, when you have a name like Van Deman, it kind of opens up  some possibilities, too. (Laughter) With a capital V and a capital D, with  the letters in between, it works out. I think it   s a decent looking  signature.  I do, too. In terms of your creative production, how much is focused on  painting and how much is focused on producing instruments?  Lately, it   s been mostly instruments and less painting because my  interest kind of isn   t there right now. With the commissions and   oh,  and I   ve been contacted by a designer back in the Boulders again in  Arizona, so painting may take precedence again. That   d be kind of nice  if it did, but I really enjoy making the banjos right now. The drum  banjo   s my new baby, (Laughs) and I have to make more flutes, too. I  stay busy.  You don   t have time to try your hand at sculpture or anything then?  Sculpture with me   I like sculpture, and I can do sculpture, and I had a  lot of classes in sculpture, but it   s a way not to paint. (Laughs) I could  work six hours on a sculpture, and I   m not going to do anything with it  when I could   ve been working six hours on a painting that I know is  going to go in a show or be sold. That   s kind of the way I look at it.  Are you still involved with the Art Guild?  No, I   ve been out of the Art Guild for a number of years. No reason  why. I just kind of drifted away.  You do go visit your mom in Anadarko once a week, isn   t it?  Yes, once a week. My mother   s ninety, and she says she   s the oldest  living Delaware. I don   t doubt it. She probably is. There was a ninety-three-  or ninety-four-year-old in California, but she died not too long  ago. If she   s not the oldest Delaware, then she   s right next to the oldest  Delaware.  So does making that trip, landscape-wise, does that sort of keep you  24  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  grounded, too?  I actually enjoy driving that. It   s right through a territory I grew up in,  right across H. E. Bailey, through Chickasha, from Chickasha to Verden,  Verden to Anadarko. It   s kind of interesting territory there, a lot of  history, and I like it. (Laughs) I like Anadarko. It   s a pretty cool town.  Take us through your creative process, if you would, from the time that  you first get an idea for something.  Okay, that could be an idea for a banjo, an idea for a flute, an idea for a  story, or an idea for a painting, and they all just seem to pop into my  head. It   s hard to say about that. I think that   s part of being an artist. I  don   t know. I know that not everybody can do it that way.  Switching back and forth from media, is it just whatever grabs you on  that particular day, sort of?  Well, with the banjos, they   re pretty much   it   s kind of a linear thing.  You start at one end, and you end up another and with all these boxes in  between. These boxes, themselves, kind of dictate what happens to a  banjo.  With the flutes, I settled on a style, which I   m going to back off on. I  really like the big-bore flutes, but they   re really difficult to make and  difficult to tune. I   m going to go back to a smaller-bore flute, which is  what you hear on the CDs. Carlos Nakai plays with probably a seven-eighths-  inch F flute, and those are the most popular. That   s probably  what I   m going to be making again.  The flute that was in the Red Earth Museum that got stolen was an oval  flute. I like the oval flutes, too, and so I   ll probably go back to making  some of those. Rather than being round, they   re kind of that shape.  I meant to ask you, too. Do you order your cigar boxes, or do you find  them?  There are two cigar box stores in Oklahoma City. The last raid I made  on them I got about 120 boxes, so I   m good for a while. (Laughter)  They   re a dollar apiece.  You don   t have to take the cigars. You can just buy the boxes.  Right. I   m not a smoker, never have been. (Laughter)  So what   s your creative routine?  25  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Creative routine on paintings is to not have anything in mind, especially  if it   s an abstract. If it   s a spirit painting, the spirits   ll happen after I get  the painting established. On the other things, it just kind of depends on  the box or the wood.  Do you come into the studio every day?  I   m here every day.  Certain set hours?  Nope. (Laughter) It drives my friends crazy when they try to visit me  here because my hours are inconsistent. I usually don   t get in until about  ten thirty, and I   ll stay until five thirty. Currently, I   ve been working on  writing some stories, so I spend about a couple hours a day writing, and  then the rest of the time I   m working on either instruments or painting.  Oh, I also work on my guitar. I manage to get at least twenty minutes to  an hour practice on guitar every day, too.  Wow  (Laughs) Renaissance man  With your writing have you published  any stories?  I have not published anything. I send copies out to friends on e-mail, and  they feed back to me whether the stories are coherent or parts they don   t  understand and that sort of thing. When I was working for the graphic  arts manufacturing company, I wrote our manuals. I got into technical  writing then, so I had kind of a basis in writing and carried it over into  fantasy short stories.  I had one that 165 pages later was no longer a short story, and it   s still  going. (Laughter) So evidently it   s a novel. I don   t know what   s going to  happen to it. I have one that is kind of interesting and could possibly  make a stage play in that it   s based on a blues player from Binger in  1930 who lives next to an Indian dance ground that   s still there. There   s  a blend of blues and powwow music, and a Mesingw character shows up  in the middle of it. It   s kind of an interesting thing, I think.  It does. It sounds really interesting. I look forward to hopefully seeing  those in print at some point. So looking back at your career from the  time you entered art full-time, what do you think was kind of a turning  point or fork-in-the-road moment for you?  Probably when I resigned from the graphic arts company and tried a few  things unsuccessfully and decided that if I was ever going to do art as an  artist, it was time to do it and start it. That was in    90. Being sixty-nine  26  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  years old now, I think the decision was a pretty good one. On wishing,  I wish I maybe had started earlier, but you know the way life works out,  it probably worked out the way it had to work out.  What   s been one of the highlights of your career so far?  Being married to Delores, having a son and two granddaughters, and  having an art career that was, at the very least, semi-successful. I didn   t  achieve the status that I would have liked, but it   s been pretty good. I   ve  had a good life all around, anyway. Growing up in Anadarko in the    50s  was something, too. Every time we have a reunion, we talk about that. It  was a pretty cool place.  And there   s more of your career to come, hopefully, too.  Hopefully.  What   s been one of the low points for you?  I don   t know that there are any low points. I   ve had some health issues  that haven   t made me real happy, but that   s one of the hazards of getting  older, too, except for the emergency appendectomy. That had nothing to  do with age. It   s just one of those things that happened, and the reason  I   m sitting here talking to you now is I had a brilliant surgeon that saved  my life. That was both a low point and a high point. (Laughs)  Yes, a blessing to come through that. Is there anything you   d like to add  or we   ve forgotten to mention before we take a look at your work?  You   ve covered it well.  Okay, let   s take a look at some paintings and hear some more about  them. All right, so we   re looking at one of your abstracts. Do you want  to tell us a little bit about this piece?  It features the spirit sticks, and they have present the Kiowa sunburst I  was talking about a while ago, the color combinations in each one. They  just represent spirit characters flowing up through the painting. I have no  idea what the title of this one is. (Laughter)  That   s really a nice one, though. Again, starting with the two colors that  you mentioned, every time you start an abstract.  Yes. In fact, some of the background is in this painting. This is a  Prussian Blue through the Raw Sienna, pure color I was talking about  right there, and then it fills in from there.  27  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  Little Thunder  Van Deman  All right, great.  Okay, this one   s called Kachina. Delawares have absolutely nothing to  do with kachinas, but I like them anyway. This one also features the  spirit sticks. The spirit sticks are based on story sticks, and they do have  to do with Delaware history. Story sticks are a bundle of sticks that the  storyteller can pick up and read like a book because of symbols or colors  or markings along the stick that he put there so he could get the story in  order while telling it. These really kind of are a spin-off of those.  So those are kind of present in a lot of your work, then?  Oh, yes, they   re present in a great deal of my work. They don   t always  look the same, but they   re there.  They   ll be there.  Yes.  Okay, and then do you want to do a crow or would you rather do a  different picture?  You want to do a crow, this one?  Sure, just kind of a nice contrast.  This one has a feather bundle inside. See, down at the bottom?  Oh, yes. Oh my goodness   Okay, this is a crow. It   s not a raven. It   s a crow. I   m a firm believer in  totem animals, and this one   s mine. Everywhere I   ve been   I used to  travel a lot, even in Germany. I was in Germany one year, and there  were six crows in a tree outside my hotel room, and in New York City I  was running into crows. Crows follow me around. This, I would call  probably an expressionist painting. The ever-present spirit sticks  represent the crow in spirit form.  That   s a nice one. I like that. I forgot if you told me the title or not.  It   s called The Crow.  The Crow, okay. (Laughs)  If it needs a title.  28  Little Thunder  Van Deman  All right, well, thank you so much for your time today, Jim.  Thanks for doing this.  -------  -------
