Story_ID: 238661
Speaker 1: --Now, what we're going to do, I have a couple of questions for you regarding your family background.  I want to start with your mother.  Could you please tell me her name?
Speaker 2: Pearl Queenie Davis, that's her family name.  And Turner is her married name.
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: In Kentucky, Louisville, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Is that where she grew up?
Speaker 2: She grew up, actually she grew up partly in Kentucky and went to school.  And her mother [Queenie Davis], who met my grandfather, they moved to West Virginia, Fairmont [West Virginia], where I was born.
Speaker 1: Now, what do you know about her background growing up as a child?  Did she tell you anything about--?
Speaker 2: Yes.  As a matter of fact, she had pretty much a normal high school background back in the day, way back in the, you know, early '30s [1930s].  And she was a singer in the choir.  She grew up--she got her letters in school, and she was pretty--had a pretty good--academically she was a pretty smart young lady.  And she loved to sing, so she became a, I think a singer in the choir and a singer in school, like I did, you know, going through all the activities.  And mostly vocals, she took vocal lessons.  And she was a pretty nice--an ace ice skater.  She was athletic in a way, you know, and played basketball and all the gymnastics that ladies do.  And she was just a terrific student and a beautiful mother.
Speaker 1: Speaking of--you said she was a beautiful mother.  How would you describe her personality, from your perspective as a child when you were growing up?  How was your mother's personality?
Speaker 2: She was spiritual, very spiritual.  I guess that comes along from my grandmother to her, passed down to her.  She liked all people.  She'd take you at face value.  She was not, she learned not to judge.  She taught me that, you know.  She learned all the basic decencies of that era, you know, how grandmothers used to teach, you know.  And she had a great deal of principle, and she, she was just one of those types of persons who learned from the older people in our families.  Like, her mother was taught--I guess her mother's mother taught her.  But, it was the value system, and what she maintained and taught to me.
Speaker 1: Did she share any particular stories with you about her childhood?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was pretty much happy days, you know, school, and meeting my dad, Carl [Turner].  She was taken by his magnetic personality, you know.  He was, he was a boxer, quite an athletic guy.  And they went to Dunbar High School [Fairmont, West Virginia] together--different--I mean she didn't go to Dunbar.  He went to Dunbar and she went to another school.  And they became friends, you know, the same dating ritual, and it was all very good.  And she talked about what a gentleman he was, and what a nice guy.  And he was, he was one of those extroverted persons, you know, and she learned a lot of things from him.  And my family of course took to him, and it was a good courtship, you know.  She, she reminds me of having fun times in her life, you know, because she was a really nice--she had a jovial personality.  She was extroverted, and I think that's where I pick my personality up from her.
Story_ID: 238662
Speaker 1: You mentioned your father.  What was his name?
Speaker 2: Carl Price Turner.
Speaker 1: Where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Georgia, his family came out of Georgia.  As far as back as I can remember through a genealogy search, his father's father was raised on a plantation in Georgia.  It was called Cobbs Corner [ph.], and it became a town, a small town.  And I think his father and mother, they moved to West Virginia from there.  And that's when he, well, of course, got into the athletic boxing.  And he was in the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: So, he grew up in West Virginia?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And now, what do you know about his background as a child?
Speaker 2: He was drafted into the Army, and he became a pugilist in the Army.  And I think that's what--he was athletic, and I think he did all the sports--track, basketball, et cetera.  And I think boxing was his forte, and that's when he took up boxing and became a very, very well-known boxer.  And he mustered out of the Army and picked up a trainer, and he became champion of West Virginia State [College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia] for five years, he was a welterweight.  So--
Speaker 1: Now, how would you describe him?  You say he was extroverted.  How else would you describe your father?
Speaker 2: Personable, you know.  My uncles and his brothers told me all about him; I didn't remember a lot about him.  I was just like four years old, up until six or seven years old, and then we moved to Cleveland [Ohio].  But about him, they said that he was a very nice person, you know, a gentleman.  And whenever--he always loved the children, and he'd take us out and play with us, you know, play baseball and whatever game was playing.  He'd run us up and down the street and give us contests and so forth and so on, and whatever.  I remember one incident my Uncle George [ph.] told me.  He said that there was a ball--we were playing ball, and the ball went down into a sewer, into a grate.  And in those days the sewers on the street, those sewer grates were like, you know, iron, you know.  And they said we were trying to get at the ball, and couldn't get it.  And somebody said, "Go call Carl, call Carl," you know.  "He'll come and get it."  So he came, my dad came and said "What's the matter, what's wrong?"  They said, "We can't get the ball, because the ball is in that sewer.  And that grate is covering it, and we can't get to it."  He said my dad bent down, he stooped down, and he, like a weightlifter, put his hands in the grate and yanked it out of the ground.  (Laughter) He said everybody was like, "Whoa," you know.  And he was like that, you know.  Call Carl if something came up that you couldn't manage, you know.  And of course my uncles all were in sports also, basketball and football and baseball.
Speaker 1: Now, how many uncles did you have?  And their names would be nice for us to have down, too.
Speaker 2: Okay.  We had, George Davis was my mother's [Pearl Davis Turner] brother.  His brother was Charles.  And he had a brother named Sonny, they called him Sonny.  That's how I got my nickname.  He named me Charles Sonny Turner.
Speaker 1: Those are all on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: No.  My dad's brother was Charles.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then he had a brother named Sonny, they called him Sonny.  And I didn't know his actual name, but it was a Turner.  And he had two brothers that I knew of, you know, that were really sharp dressers, you know, men about town guys, you know.
Story_ID: 238663
Speaker 1: You seem to have a good grasp on your genealogy.  How far back can you go on either side, as far as your grandparents and great-grandparents are concerned?
Speaker 2: My mother's [Pearl Davis Turner]--my mother's mother, her father, in Kentucky they were Cherokee Indians [Native Americans], half-Cherokee Indians.
Speaker 1: So that would be your great-grandfather?
Speaker 2: Great-grandfather.  And my father's [Carl Turner] people came out Georgia.  Of course they were off a plantation; my father's father was off a plantation.  And they were African, you know, full African.  And my mother's mother, she was half Caucasian and Indian.  So then my mother's people on her side, you know, that's where she received her complexion and her makeup.  She was half-Indian and half-Caucasian.
Speaker 1: Now, did you know your grandparents very well on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My grandmother was the matriarch, of course.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Queenie Davis.  That's, that's the name that I knew, Queenie Davis.
Speaker 1: And what can you tell us about her?
Speaker 2: She--well, she was the primal grandmother of grandmothers.  In other words, she was God in our family.  (Laughter) You know, she had the direct connection to God, and anything Grandmother said was law.  You pass that, you step over the line, you know, you've had it.  And anything that she says--she could speak to you and you'd have to stop in your tracks, you know.  Because sometimes we'd run off.  And she said, "Don't run.  Come here."  Well, that was like hypnosis, you know.  (Laughter).  Like Dracula, "Do not run, come here, you know."  (Laughter).  It was sort of like some kind of magnetic force, you know.  And she was so warm and loving that we just sat at her feet, and she'd be picking string beans and stuff like that, and talking.  And she'd hum and be singing to you, you know, and we'd pick up songs.  And she, you know, and we'd play the radio.  And she'd make you learn how to pick beans, and wash up your hands.  "Did you wash your hands?"  You know, "Go wash your face, clean up.  Take your clothes off.  Put your play clothes on," you know.  And my mother would hardly have to say a lot of things, because Grandmother was there, you know, and had her back, you know.  If she said "[HistoryMaker] Sonny [Turner], put that down."  Well, she didn't say it too many times, because my grandmother would say--if my father wasn't in the room, you know, my grandmother would say, "That's the second time I've heard your name.  Come here."  She said, "That's the second time I heard your name."  I said, "Yes, Ma'am."  She said, "Well, I don't want to hear it again," you know.  And you'd snap too, you know.  But what made you behave was the respect, because they were so loving to you, you know.  And when they hit you for doing wrong--they'd give you one on the backside--you know, it was, you could understand it, you know.  And there was nothing but--and then the next minute she would grab you and hug you, and say "That hurt me more than it hurt you," you know, that type of thing.
Speaker 1: Now, how about your grandfather on that side?
Speaker 2: I didn't know him too well.  I didn't know too much about him, except that he was a pretty nice guy, you know, as far as I knew.  You know, I didn't know any other histrionics about him.  But I intend to do some research on his background, you know, to find out exactly who he was.
Speaker 1: Now, how about on your father's side, his mother and father?
Speaker 2: My father's father was, I think he was a millworker, you know.  And his father was, of course, a slave, and his father's father.  And that's as far as I know about him, you know.  So, I need to a little bit more research on both those guys.
Story_ID: 238664
Speaker 1: What's your earliest memory that you have, growing up?
Speaker 2: Earliest memory?  Wow.  Riding my tricycle, and my grandmother [Queenie Davis] told me not to ride it in the house. (Laughter).  So, I took it--we had sort of like a little walk, a mound, in front of our house.  We had a large home, and it was two families in that home, my first cousins and our family.  And there was a lady, Miss Maggie [ph.], I think, who was my grandmother's friend.  And I remember her just as well, because she used to smoke asthmatic cigarettes.  She set our house on fire, unfortunately.  (Laughter) Miss Maggie, that's what they called her.  Anyway, I was riding my bicycle, and it went down and it hit the door and rolled into the house.  And there was a potbelly stove right in front of the, in the living room in the middle of the room.  And I almost hit it, and I fell off my bike.  And my grandmother told me, "Uh-huh, what did I tell you?  Uh-huh, see."  (Laughter).  That's what one of my earliest memories that I can recollect, from a three-year old, four-year old.
Speaker 1: So, you were about three or four years old?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So this would be about 1941, '42 [1942], something like that?
Speaker 2: Or something, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 238665
Speaker 1: Now were there any other special memories?  What were holidays like, and family life in that house with, you know, with your cousins?  What was the household--?
Speaker 2: It was very, very warm.  Christmas was like--that's where I think I got that love for the Christmas holiday, the Christmas season.  We'd get the tree, go out and get a tree.  We had to get a real tree.  We had to learn how to put it in the bucket of dirt in a little damp water--damp, you know, keep it damp, not too much water, but a little damp.  And making Christmas ornaments, and paper-cutting, and Christmas ornaments.  We didn't have a lot of money, you know, but there was a lot of talent.  Mothers and grandmothers always had that talent to make things look so pretty, you know, the Christmas trees and stuff like that, yeah.
Story_ID: 238666
Speaker 1: Now, your siblings.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh?
Speaker 1: Could you list their names in their birth order and include yourself, please?
Speaker 2: My brother Carl, who is in that picture, he was next to me, and a year older.  Freddie [ph.], my oldest brother, he was, he went to--I don't want to go too fast, but he was--this is my oldest brother, you know.  I have a picture of the three of us, and we were all dressed in suits.  We all were "macked" out, because Mom [Pearl Davis Turner] kept us, you know, clean.  And my oldest brother Carl was a fighter, a boxer.  He had a voice, vocal.  And as I remember, he was kind of mean, he had a temper.  (Laughter).  And Freddie was always the one pulling him off of me, you know.  Because I, of course I would bite when I was small.  (Laughter).  I couldn't do anything else but bite.  But he was a nice guy.  He loved me, you know.  But I mean, it was like brothers do, you know.  And you can't stand your little brother, because he's always nosing into things he's got no business in, you know.  He'll run up behind you, "No, you can't go.  Go back home."  You know, that kind of thing.  And he was a good guy, though.  And if anything would happen, boy, he--you know.  Like when we used to call my father [Carl Turner], "Go get Carl," well, my brother next to me was named Carl.  And you don't want Carl coming after you if you mess with his little brother, you know.  Freddie was like a peacemaker, because he was smarter, you know.  But Carl had a temper.  And if you do something to him, it was like a death sentence, you know.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So you lived in Fairmont, West Virginia for about ten years of your life, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, around then, yeah, from my birth.
Speaker 1: To about ten?
Speaker 2: I didn't leave until I--no, I left earlier.  When we left Fairmont, I think I was around five years old, or six.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then we moved to Cleveland [Ohio], because my dad was in the hospital.  He had an incident where he had--from boxing--he had an aneurysm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they had to put him in the hospital.  And I think, I remember us moving to Cleveland because it was opportunities that presented itself.  And family members, you know, we moved, some moved to Columbus, Ohio, and some moved to Cleveland.
Speaker 1: So, you went to Cleveland, Ohio?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And what street did you live on in Cleveland?  Do you recall the street?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 40th [Street] and Woodland [Avenue].  I'll never forget when we first, when we got to Cleveland, just being a little guy.  And 40th and Woodland was an apartment building, you know, back in the day when there were a lot of families in apartment buildings.  And across the street was just, they were just starting the projects, you know, across the street.  And I remember very vividly that the streetcars ran up and down Woodland Avenue.  And there was a drugstore on one corner, and projects across this corner.  And on our side of the street, the rooming house, it was all just rooming houses and apartment buildings.  And then there was a beer garden on the corner across the street from the school that I went to.  And it was called Case Woodland Grammar School [Case-Woodland School, Cleveland, Ohio].
Story_ID: 238667
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights?  You mentioned very well some things, but what were the sights, sounds, and smells of your community, you know?
Speaker 2: Oh, the neighborhood, in the black community, you know, I mean you're talking about greens and cornbread and ham hocks smelling.  And I mean all because in those days, people would cook with their windows up, open, you know.  And I mean, and the holiday season, I mean you're talking about pies.  And I mean, it was just glorious.  I mean it was really just, it was like walking into a soul food restaurant, actually.  (Laughter).  Because where we lived, we lived downstairs.  And across, just across from the steps that go up to the other apartments, there was Mrs. Fields [ph.], okay.  And upstairs was Mrs. Presley [ph.].  And upstairs on the second floor, on the third floor, was Edwin Starr's [ph.] family, you know.  And Charles Hatchett [ph.], the Hatchett family lived upstairs.  But all these ladies and these mothers would be cooking soul food.  Man, the Sunday cooking, you could smell chicken frying.  I mean, and once in a while there was some chittlins going on, you know.  (Laughter).  And the smells of the neighborhood was always pleasant, nothing really negative.  Because across from us, across the parking lot from my door where we lived was an alley, and you'd go right through to the produce market.  From the produce market was Case-Woodland School [Cleveland, Ohio], across the street.  So I could go from my door right across the parking lot, through the alley, and jump the fence and go to my school.  So, the smells were always pleasant.  As a matter of fact, you were hungry no matter which way you went, you know.  (Laughter).  And we would, it was pleasant.  And then I remember walking to school, and the beer garden, you would smell the beer of course and hear the music playing, and people in the beer garden, you know, making it in the back.  And boy, on the weekends, look out, you know.
Speaker 1: What were some of the sounds?  Did you hear a lot of sounds?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Well, we had not too many sirens, you know.  But once in a while there was some action going on, family fights, you know, people getting locked up.  We had a policeman on the corner of, a black policeman, called Buck [ph.], we called him Buck.  And he wore his gun like a six-gun, you know, and he was the neighborhood cop.  He was mean as--you know.  And he kept, he kept a pretty tight rein on the goings-on around the town.  But the sounds were--I'd give--we'd be playing Louis Jordan, (humming) at the 'Tippin In.'  And you'd hear Nellie Lutcher singing, and Dinah Washington when you'd walk by.  You'd hear them playing the jukebox, and all of those great singers--Billy Eckstine, you know.  We used to walk slow sometimes just to hear the music, you know.  And we'd stand on the corner.  "You kids go to school," you know.  Because the crossing guard would be there, and we'd be standing around trying to hear the music.  And they'd be "Come on, come on, come on, you know, you don't need to be standing there."  But those were the sounds, you know, the neighborhood kids playing.  We had the Knight [ph.] family who lived in the back of the apartment building.  There were seven of those guys.  And their dad was Tripp [ph.], they called him Tripp.  He was a cook in the [U.S.] Army, and he used to come home and bring all manner of ice cream, kegs of ice cream, and just lots of things for the kids, you know.  And we'd take our bowls from the house, and he'd give you just, just swipe your bowl, you know, with ice cream.  I mean it was just, it was just great.  It was wonderful, yeah.
Story_ID: 238668
Speaker 1: Who were some of your friends in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: The Knight [ph.] family, the Knight children; the Fields [ph.] children, Raymond [ph.], Philip [ph.].  Here's some names for you.  The Knight family who lived in the back upstairs, they had like nine rooms.  But they, it was Bridgett [ph.], Midgett [ph.], Pritchett [ph.], Bitchett [ph.]--(Laughter).  Pritchett, Bridgett, and Midgett.  And then there was, one girl was called Siwah [ph.], because she was a tall, pretty girl, but she was a tomboy, okay.  Then we had Snooky [ph.], then Raymond [ph.] and Philip [ph.], and of course Charles Hatchett [ph.], which is Edwin Starr [ph.].  And then we had Morris [ph.] and Henry [ph.], who were the older brothers in the Knight family.  We had a whole bunch of them.  One guy lived upstairs, Eugene [ph.] was his name.  He was nice, a very athletic guy.  And then we had William Hawkins [ph.].  We had, the Millionaire Barbershop [ph.] was right in front of my house.  So we had Skip [ph.], and we had the guys in the barbershop who lived there.  And they had their kids, Donald [ph.], and just a whole bunch.  And across the street there was an Italian family, Ricky [ph.] and Tony [ph.] and all of them.  You know, we'd all be playing.  We all, you know, interacted with each other.  And--
Speaker 1: So it was a mixed neighborhood?
Speaker 2: A mixed neighborhood, yeah.  We had Jewish families, Italian families, we had Puerto Rican families.  I mean all--you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: What were things like socially, you know, as far as race was concerned?
Speaker 2: Racially it was, the neighborhood was cool.  I mean, everybody had their own ethnic holidays and ethnicities going on.  But everybody kind of respected each other, you know.  And you'd go across the street and the Italian families, "You going to school?" and so on and so on.  "Hey, Tony, let's go," and you know, "Hey, [HistoryMaker] Sonny [Turner]."  You know, and you'd go by, "Have you eaten today?  Come on in, have some spaghetti with us," you know.  "Have some--have you eaten?  Have some oatmeal."  You know, that type of thing.  Families would look after children, I mean no matter who they were.  And if you got caught doing something wrong, you would get chastised by anybody.  Any adult in the neighborhood could chastise you.
Speaker 1: How were things in Cleveland [Ohio] in general, racially?
Speaker 2: Racially, it was fine.  The west side was kind of, kind of--the east side where we lived was okay.  But the west side was, you know, they had little problems, you know, racially.  It wasn't a mixture of people over there so much.  And then north of there was what we called Shaker Heights [Ohio].  You didn't go in that area too much unless you were on the streetcar going to the golf club, to work on the golf club.
Speaker 1: So, they still had a few issues?
Speaker 2: We had issues, yeah.  And it was surrounding us, but it wasn't so much in our circle of mixture.  That's why a lot of times when we grew up we didn't realize the racial problems, you know, unless you got outside of your neighborhood.  And then you said, "Oh, wow."
Speaker 1: I've heard that many times from people your age, who say that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --they were sheltered from it, because their whole life was in their neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Or in a certain vicinity.
Speaker 2: We had a mixture of people there that didn't particularly--you know, there wasn't--you know, there was no racial bias in the neighborhood, because we had to depend on each other more or less.  And we all were, you know, poor families, you know, and we lived modestly in modest homes.  You know, we didn't have a lot of money, and nobody had airs, you know.  We kind of--it was kind of nice, I thought.  Because, see, you got along with everybody, you know, every ethnicity.  There were some Chinese people that had a restaurant, a soup kitchen, and they were nice folks, you know.  They all treated the children pretty nice, you know.  I didn't really experience it until I got my shoeshine box made, and we went to catch the streetcar and go downtown--
Story_ID: 239106
Speaker 1: So, what elementary school did you go to?  You mentioned the school earlier.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the elementary school was Case-Woodland [School, Cleveland, Ohio].  I had a lot of nice experiences there as a youngster, you know.  I was, I was not a great student, because I would, you know, gaze out the window and have a lot going on up here about what I wanted to do, and the movie I saw.  I went to the movies and I saw this musical, you know, 'An American in Paris' with Gene Kelly.  And I said "That's me, man," you know.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers that influenced you in elementary school, in particular?
Speaker 2: Yeah, as a matter of fact there were a couple.  Miss Scharaba [ph.], she was the principal.  And there was Miss Neal [ph.], who was fine, looked like Barbara McNair.  I mean exactly--I mean carbon copy, you know, a knockout, you know.  She was real sweet and very nice.  And, but she was stern, but she had to be.  A gym teacher, Miss King [ph.], our gym teacher, she was really a nice lady.
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned before we got to this small break that you had a shoeshine box?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, is this during elementary school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, during elementary school.  As a matter of fact, when I--my brothers, you know, we were all--we were all about trying to be entrepreneurs and trying to learn to make money, you know.  And the family thing was about, you know, you got to make your life worth something.  What can you do?  Like in those days we had woodshop, metal shop, you know, where we could learn to make things.  I made some bookends--you know, how you learn to do things--for my mother [Pearl Davis Turner]--and little wood statues.  You know, you'd learn to work with your hands.  And the idea was to--so I worked in the barbershop.  I started in the barbershop sweeping up, you know, and it was the Millionaire's Barbershop [ph.].  And you talk about that movie, 'Barbershop,' they don't know nothing.  (Laughter).  It's almost--they got an idea.  But those guys were like mentors, you know.  They would mentor you, you know what I mean, about growing up and what a man is, you know.  "If you're going to be a man, you know, get a job.  Go to school, learn something.  Become somebody.  Become--have self-respect."  They were all about that, you know.  And so I worked at the barbershop and learned to shine shoes and learned how to use the polish, like what polish to use on what shoes.  Because when I first started out, I was messing up some shoes, you know.  (Laughter).  How to use the sole dressing, how to--it was the technique, you know.  And then I got to the point where I used to watch Donald [ph.].  Donald, he was Skip's [ph.], the owner of--one of the owners of the barbershop's nephew.  And he could, he knew how to shine some shoes, you know.  And then they'd pop the rag, you know, pop the rag and play the music on the radio, and I learned all that from the guys in there.  And I learned to--my brothers built their shoeshine boxes.  They took the wood, and they made whatever piece of wood--mostly out of hard oak.  And they cut, they drew the pattern and they used the saw.  And you couldn't use the saw unless you were instructed, you know, because the saws are dangerous instruments--and the machines.  And they would never let the younger boys use the saw unless they had an older instructor with them.  But they taught me how to draw a design for the box--the two ends and the sides, and the bottom, just twelve inches on each side, and the bottom twelve inches, and I learned how to put them together.  And then you have the pyramid sides for the foot, for your foot.  And you take your own shoe, and you draw on the wood your own shoe imprint, and you make it--it's like an average size is 8-1/2 or a 10 for your shoe.  Then you had a little piece of wood you put in there for the heel, for the person to put their foot on, and it would hold their foot still.  They taught me all the methods of how to make the box.  So I made my shoeshine box, and I painted it red.  (Laughter).  Red, I bought some old red paint and painted it red.  My brothers saw that box and they went "What is that?"  You know, and then they showed me how to put my polish in, and the brushes together.  You mash the brushes together and you put the brushes in, and you stack your polish.  And you have your liquid polish on the other end and a little piece of cardboard between them so they won't spill out and everything.  And you have, you carry your shoeshine box with your hand underneath the foot mold.  And that was my shoeshine box, and I learned to make one.  Then I made a better one of course after that, you know.  But my first one was ugly, (laughter) it was ugly.

Speaker 1: --Said you went downtown with that?
Speaker 2: Yes, we used to catch the streetcar.  Well, I went with my brothers.  They wouldn't let me--you know, I used to go right to the corner to the beer garden, which I wasn't allowed in, and catch some of the guys coming out on the weekends, you know, up town, sharp-looking guys.  "There's that kid."  "Do you want a shoeshine, Mister?"  You know, and they'd give me--and sometimes they wouldn't let me shine their shoes; they'd just give me a quarter, you know, or twenty cents, fifteen cents, you know.  And that's how I was getting my first start around the neighborhood.  And then in the barbershop I learned to increase my knowledge about how to shine shoes.  And the better I got the more money I was making, because the guys knew that I knew what I was doing.  And then we, my brothers would take me downtown with them, and they'd say "You watch," you know, and they'd teach me how to approach people.  And then you sat in certain places.  They wouldn't let you sit in front of like a store and catch people coming out, because that's soliciting.  And we didn't understand that, you know--that you stop the customers and bothering people.  So we'd wait just when the store was closed, and we'd be in front of that store and catch people coming down the street and what have you.  And I was--and after a while my brothers let me bring my shoeshine box, and I started learning.  And I'd say, "Good evening, how are you, sir?  Would you like a shoeshine?  I shine off real good."  And I'd put on my box fifteen cents for a shoeshine.  Wash and shine was twenty-five cents.  (Laughter).  They taught me all the ropes.  And I'm setting up my shoeshine box once, and I was--and my brothers were down the street.  And they said, "You go up there to the corner and, you know, so we can see you.  You know, don't get out of sight."  And I was sitting there, and I'm sitting in this storefront, and it was like an echo.  And I started singing, "Da da, da, da, da, da," you know, and the echo would come back.  And some white guy walked past and he stopped and looked at me, and he said, "Shut up."  And I said, he must be crazy.  "Da da da da, da," and the guy came and smacked me in the head.  (Laughter).  He smacked me in my head.  So now I'm like, "What!"  You know, "What did this guy hit me for?"  You know, like "What?"  And I--and the guy had walked off.  And I walked out and I was crying, you know.  My brother saw me, and he ran up there with his shoeshine box, "What's the matter with you?"  I said, "That guy hit me."  He said, "He what?"  I said, "That guy hit me."  He said, "No, he didn't."  (Laughter).  He dropped his shoeshine box.  And that was Carl.  Carl is the one you don't want to mess with, okay.  He called out to that guy, and the guy turned around and saw him coming.  Well, Raymond [ph.] started following Carl, and then Buzz [ph.] was, Buzzy was behind him, and they were running after this guy. And they caught this guy and commenced to kicking his-- (laughter).  And they said, "Why did he hit you?"  I said, "I don't know."  He said, "Shut up, nigger," you know, just like that.  And that was the first experience I had with racism.

Speaker 1: You mentioned that you were an average student?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you had a lot of daydreaming and things going on.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And as a child, basically what was your behavior like?
Speaker 2: Mischievous, following the group for a minute.  And my mother [Pearl Davis Turner] would catch me doing something and she'd say, "What are you following them for?  What are you throwing rocks for?"  "Well, ain't nobody in the house."  "That's somebody's property, okay, dummy.  You don't break the windows; that cost money.  How do you know nobody's going to move in there?  You know, if it's deserted, that don't mean you got a right to destroy it."  I was doing all kind of crazy stuff, following the leader.  And my mother said, "Do not follow.  Learn your mistakes, and you can lead," you know.  And she--I used to get--I'll tell you.  One time I was up, I caught a streetcar and went up on Kinsman Avenue [Kinsman Road], about three miles from home where some friends of mine lived.  And I was standing out there waiting for the bus, and lo and behold, Mr. Skip Fleming [ph.] from the barbershop came up behind me and tapped me on the shoulder.  He said, "What are you doing up here?"  I said, "Oh, we were playing over in the gulley over there."  And he says, "It's 7:30.  You live at 40th [Street] and Woodland [Avenue], you know."  And he says, "Now, I'll tell you what."  He said, "You catch the bus.  I'm going to stand right here, and you catch the bus and you go home."  And he had me by my shirt, you know, and he said "You go home."  And those kids were, you know, getting on in the evening.  And the bus came and he said, "Put him off at 40th and Woodland.  And don't get off until--."  And the bus driver said, "Sit here behind me."  (Laughter).  He said, "Sit down behind me."  And Skip said, "I'm coming in about half an hour or so, and I'm going to find out if you're going to be home, you know."
Speaker 1: It was the whole village raising the child at that time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And they wouldn't let you get away with anything.
Speaker 1: There was no talking back.
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  Talk back?  Do you want to live?  (Laughter).  You don't look back, either, you know.  Don't roll your eyes and all that kind of business, like you ain't going to do what was told to you, you know, none of that.  And he sent me home, and the bus driver told me, he said "Wait a minute."  And he looked out at his, he was looking in his mirror.  And he said "Wait right there.  And when I say go, you run."  And the bus driver looked both ways, and he said "Okay, run."  And I ran across the street and he was standing there, sitting there watching me.  He said, "Home!"  (Laughter).  And I ran up the hallway and went to my house, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned being a daydreamer.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What were some of your dreams and aspirations?  You said you saw Gene Kelly.  And--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I saw movies; I was into movies.  I was, I loved the musicals.  And like all the rest of us kids, we would pretend to be the actors, you know.  We would act out some of the movies we saw, you know.  I was into Roy Rogers and, you know, Lash LaRue and all them guys, you know.  And we would, we had stick horses; we would--you know.  And we'd see television series on TV.  But the musicals, they were--Technicolor was just coming in.  And was thinking about, "Man, oh, that guy just--."  You know, you'd see the movies, and the way they'd do those stage shows and the singing and the dancing, you know.  That stayed in my head a lot.  And the teacher would come over to me, "[HistoryMaker Sonny] Turner?"  I'd go "Yes, Ma'am."  She says, "Nine times nine?"  I go, "Oh, what you say?"  (Laughter) You know, things like that.  But I pepped up.  Because one time I was daydreaming and the teacher came over and hit me with a ruler and cracked me across the knuckles, yeah.  They were allowed to hit you.  You know, corporal punishment, they were allowed to hit you.
Story_ID: 239109
Speaker 1: Did your family attend church?
Speaker 2: Oh, big time.  We were a churchgoing family.  My grandmother [Queenie Davis] was very, very spiritual and she was deep into religion, you know, in a nice way, not a fanatic--you know, in a nice way.
Speaker 1: So, what denomination were you?
Speaker 2: Baptist.
Speaker 1: How were your experiences at church?
Speaker 2: Pretty, they were pretty good.  Well, when I first started going to church, it was like, "Oh, boy.  I got to sit here and listen to this guy scream at everybody," you know.  And the ladies, when the people started shouting it scared me.  (Laughter) You know, I was sitting next to a woman, and her foot, her legs started going; you know, Sister so and so.  "Oh yeah, oh, Lord."  And I'm going, "Oh, what's happening with this lady," you know.  And she started--and then the hands went up.  "Oh, Jesus!"  I went, (laughter) I went to crawl underneath the bench.  (Laughter) Because it kind of scared me, you know, I didn't understand the spirituality of it.  And then I got to understand what church was about.  Then we had to go to Sunday school.  I stayed for Sunday school, and then we had to stay for the Sunday school dinner.  And my mother [Pearl Davis Turner] was in the choir, and that's one thing I enjoyed, watching her sing.  I can hear her voice, you know.  She was an alto, and I can hear her singing.  I used to love to see her with her robe on.  And that singing, there was something about it.  And when I got older, as I got older I learned to appreciate the seriousness of what was being said and what my grandmother was saying as it related to church, and the importance of what Jesus and Christ and God--you know, and the Ten Commandments, you know, and so forth and so on.  But I got--and then the singing started to infiltrate into my being, you know.  They started singing and sometimes they would be--have you ever heard Dr. Watts [ph.]?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: When they started singing there was a thing, a spiritual thing.  I think it was from slavery time.  They would start to moan (humming), and the whole church would say, "Ah-um."  You know, and I'd say "Wow."  I mean it was unspoken word, but everybody knew how to, where to sing.
Speaker 1: The harmony was there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But I mean the spirit that permeated through the room was scary, man.  I mean, it grabbed hold of you.  And I found myself--man, one time I was sitting there and I started crying, and didn't know why, you know.  And that's scary.  It kind of scared me, you know.  And the church, the whole church would join in, and they would do a series of spiritual moans.  And it was like, whew, man, strong, very powerful.
Speaker 1: Well, it's been tied into those moments which also were the African equivalent to the Om, and how people would chant the Om.
Speaker 2: Yeah, "A-um."
Speaker 1: In Hindu.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And so it was the same, there was something very spiritual about those sounds.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I think that all people, regardless of their culture, would have them.  So, that's probably what you were experiencing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was experiencing that, and really got touched by it.  The Om--and they would--but it was such a strong sound, you know.  Like four or five people would start, and then you got a congregation of maybe eighty or ninety people.  And they would all come in at the same time, at a certain moan, you know, at a certain time.  And boy, it was very powerful, you know.
Speaker 1: A real powerful, I guess we would call it a vibration?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it would just run right through you.  I've experienced that, and so I know what, you know, the spiritual thing is.

Speaker 1: So now where did you go to junior high school?
Speaker 2: Kinnard Junior High [School, Cleveland, Ohio].  Boy, I tell you, going to Kinnard Junior High.  Hot dog, I'm going to junior high school, you know.  (Laughter) Gonna run through the projects.  It was set sort of in the middle of the projects.  They had like what they call the POC, the public outreach center for children.  And it had a big community pool, huge, and it was like a football field.  And of course they had two feet, three feet, and then they had five feet.  When you got to five feet, they had a fence.  And then it was six feet and then seven, you know, for the older kids.  Then the swimming guards were, they were all--the lifeguards, they were tough guys from the neighborhood, you know, and they all had that physique, you know.  And then they wore these hats, you know, and they had the big red cross on them.  And they were really--really guys you could admire, you know, and say "That's who I want to be like, you know."  And Kinnard Junior High was my first dating; you know, girls, you know.  (Laughter) And then we had our little doo-wop thing going.
Speaker 1: So what year would this have been, when you went to junior high school?
Speaker 2: In '52 [1952], somewhere around in there, '51 [1951], '52 [1952].
Speaker 1: Who were some of your friends?
Speaker 2: Oh, all the neighborhood guys.  We made a lot of friends, because we all started the little singing thing going on, you know.
Speaker 1: Oh, so you started singing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had a--there was neighborhood singing groups, you know.  And there was a few gangs, you know, which that was, you know, was a no-no for us.  And we started singing.  And--
Speaker 1: Now, what facilitated this starting to sing?  Did you just one day decide--
Speaker 2: Well, I started singing in church.  And my mother [Pearl Davis Turner] heard me singing one day, sitting by the radio.  And she says, "Oh, let me hear that again," you know.  "Oh, I'm going to put you in the junior choir," you know.  And I said, "Okay," you know.  And then I got to liking it, and then I started singing in school assemblies, you know, when we'd do our little school songs.  And then all of a sudden they said, "Get [HistoryMaker] Sonny Turner up there to sing a song for the class."  I went, "Oh, no."  You know, I had stage fright, and I got over that after a while.  And then we started--then my brothers' friends around the neighborhood, they started to, you know, have these singing things going on.  And somebody said, "They got a rehearsal going on over at James [ph.], I mean, Andrew Forester's [sic. Andrew Fortson] house."  And Freddie Camp, the lead singer, was going to leave the group.  And they said, "Man, you ought to go over there to that rehearsal around the corner there over at Andy's house.  They have a group over there, they call it the Tones, the Metrotones."  I said, "The Metrotones?"  They said, "Yeah."  And then James Frierson came over to my house and said, "Would you like to come over to our rehearsal?"  And I said, "Yeah."  And they were all singing the songs--The Moonglows, you know, from the, you know, all the big--the '50s [1950s] things.
Speaker 1: Now, this was in high school, or junior high?
Speaker 2: Yeah, junior high.
Speaker 1: Okay, junior high.
Speaker 2: This is all, this is running together with the junior high school thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And that's how I got into the singing, and what happened in junior high school.  And I went to the Metrotones' rehearsal and they were singing 'Sincerely,' and they were singing, you know, some of the tunes from the different singing groups.  And I got there and they said, "Well, do, you know this song?"  You know, and I said "Yeah, man."  And I was sitting up there singing along with them, and they said "Do you know the words to 'Sincerely'?"  And I said "Yeah."  You know, and I started singing.  And they said, "Hey, man, this sounds pretty good."  They said, "Can you sing the whole song?"  I said, "Yeah, I can sing the whole song," you know.  And they said, "Well, Freddie is--."  You know, Freddie Camp was, he was at rehearsal.  He says, "You sound pretty good, man."  He said, "Why don't you sing?"  And I said, "Freddie, you don't mind?"  Because there was a little jealousy thing going on there.  And they said, "Well, if you don't want to sing no more, man, we'll let Sonny Turner sing."  And I sang, so they liked the way I sounded and they said, "You sing the lead."  I said, "Sing the lead?  Okay, you know, cool."  And then I started singing, and then they brought the girl singer, Leuvenia [Eaton], you know.  And they said, "We got--."  You know, they started playing The Platters' music.  And I'm saying, "Man, I love The Platters' stuff."  So we started singing, and Leuvenia was awfully cute, you know.  I said, "I think I want to sing in this group," you know.  (Laughter). And we got be friends, and later on, you know, we started the little romantic thing.
Speaker 1: And we'll go through that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: We'll go forward into that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, it lended itself to the school assemblies.
Story_ID: 239111
Speaker 1: You are now in junior high [Kinnard Junior High School, Cleveland, Ohio].  You're also now in The Metrotones?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So now you have a little status?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now in this, during this time period, you know, we have a lot of competition among youth in different things today.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, was the singing group the mode of competition versus a gang?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Who had the best singing group?
Speaker 2: That was our inspiration and competition, you know, a mode to compete, you know, rather than compete with a knife and a gun, you know, because we kind of shunned that gang thing.  Because there was a group, a gang, called the Devil's Henchmen and the Joker's Wild group, and they had jackets, you know.  And it was kind of dangerous, we thought, you know, kind of--and that didn't get as many girls, either.  (Laughter) So, we stuck to the singing thing, you know, and that was our inspiration.  And the group called--my brother Carl was in a group called the Carousels.  And they, they were more mature, and they sang very well, you know.  They had harmony that was killer harmony, you know.  And we all kind of fashioned ourselves after certain groups--The Five Keys, The Platters, and then we started trying to sing modern harmony.  You know, there were The Four Freshmen and The Hi-Lo's.  And we, and then we got to the point where we started to--in school, they said if you want to sing, you got to know what note you're singing in, you know, so the piano thing.  We got into learning to sing on pitch.
Speaker 1: Now there was no iPod, there was no CD.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: How did you all, how was music taught and listened to?
Speaker 2: In school by the various school music classes.
Speaker 1: How about the radio?  Did you--
Speaker 2: The radio, we heard the songs on the radio.  You know, like Alan Freed was playing the latest discs, you know, spinning the latest hits.  And we learned to emulate those particular backgrounds and those songs.  And then we started to learn that the piano would give you pitch.  So we get in school, and after we school we'd get in the study hall and we'd, you know, be banging on the piano.  And then one of the schoolteachers said, "Oh."  And she tried to teach us to sing chromatically, in good harmony, you know.  "[HistoryMaker] Mr. [Sonny] Turner, what voice do you sing?" you know.  Well, sing on your part."  Because sometimes we, the guys would be running all over trying to sing falsetto, trying to sing bass.  She said, "Sing your note.  That's where you make harmony, you know."
Speaker 1: And it was uncanny.  When I listen to music from that period, there was a lot of great intonation.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: People weren't singing flat, or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --sharp.  It was definitely on--
Speaker 2: Right on.
Speaker 1: --intonation.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And that was due to the, you think training?
Speaker 2: It was training.  Well, later on, what happened was when we used to--in high school [East Technical High School, Cleveland, Ohio] when we learned from the music teacher, who took an interest, then we took an interest.  And they saw that this was one of the things that kept us out of the streets and out of trouble, and it was something positive.  They would take their time to say "Come on, guys, you know, meet me at 4:00 after school, and we'll bang out a couple of things."  And we learned to sing our parts.  And we learned what voice you sang, you know, what your range was.  And you know, then we learned intonation, because then we learned to sing harmony.  The only way to learn to sing harmony is to sing soft, and sing so that you can hear and stay on your note, you know.  And then we learned listening to the singing groups, the great singing groups.  And we played our records, man, and we'd be listening.  And we learned and sang, you know, like that, and stayed in harmony.  And then we got into all vocal group contests, all city vocal group contests.  And we'd come out and we'd have choreography, man, and we, you know, we were dancing and singing.
Story_ID: 239112
Speaker 1: We went to--I went to East Tech Senior High [East Technical High School, Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 2: And were there important teachers there that really influenced you?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  There was everybody that--as a matter of fact, the sports, the athletic coach.  Man, they had a strong basketball team.
Speaker 2: Do you recall their names?
Speaker 1: Woodson [ph.] was one of them.  And Stevenson [ph.], you know, different people like that.
Speaker 2: How about in music?
Speaker 1: Music teacher, what's her name?  Beckrow [ph.], she had a German name.  And, Mr. Stringer [ph.], a big German guy, who was our athletic coach, you know.  He came in and caught us in the bathroom singing, and we were supposed to have been out on the court, you know, after we took a break.  And we went in the bathroom man, and we started singing.  (Singing) "Do, do, do, do, do."  We were in there, you know; We had it down, you know, doing The Drifters and what have you, singing 'Money Honey,' and all that stuff.  And he came in there, and she says, "Oh, so, you waste your time in here screaming at each other."  (Laughter) He said, "You think you can sing, yeah."  You know, like that.  And he was a big German guy, you know.  And he says, "Let me hear that again," you know.  And he took us up to the principal's office.  And we said, "Oh, we're dead."  He said, "These guys think they can sing."  He said, "Sing that song you were singing," and we sang for the principal.  And they looked at each other and they said, (nods head).  They said, "Get them to sing in the assembly."  So we, that's, we got to singing in the assembly, you know, and stuff like that.
Speaker 2: So, there was support?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Among--
Speaker 1: Full support.  And when they saw that you were involved in something that was productive, you know, they didn't want to kill it, you know.  As long as it was productive, you didn't have to have the academic skills right on you.  They sort of pushed you toward the learning--you know, of course, you get into those books.
Speaker 2: Who was really influencing you at that moment, during this part of your life in high school?
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: Was it the singing groups?
Speaker 1: The singing groups.  At that time Clyde McPhatter, The Drifters, The Five Keys--whew, and The Moonglows, and The Hi-Lo's.  And the--just all of the groups that--The Mills Brothers, those guys were unbelievable.  Because they would, they wouldn't use instruments.  They would emulate instruments, you know.  And they would do like harmonic sounds, and they would do trumpet sounds and, you know, all that.  And they would make their own orchestration--orchestra sounds, to back up the singing.  They were influential.
Speaker 2: And during this time, also wasn't Nat King Cole coming on television now?
Speaker 1: Oh, man, he was--as a matter of fact it was one of the big things we did, gathering around the TV.  We only had three channels, you know, black and white.  But the neighborhood would gather around when his show ['The Nat King Cole Show'] would come on.  You talking about a smooth, classy, guy.  That's what influenced a lot of us, because his hair was done to the nines--laid, dyed, fried, and laid to the side, and not a hair out of place, man; them waves were happening.  And he had, he had, he was just classy, he had class.  And that's when we locked into Nat Cole and Louis Armstrong and people of that kind, all those great performers.  But Nat had the TV show, and we would just bounce off of Nat, you know, because he was so many things.  Then he'd sing--then he started singing in French, and he was singing in German, and he was singing in different languages.  And we said, "Well, that's the way to go, man."  You know, this guy is so versatile, you know.  And he was one of the big, big, influences on me, you know, as far as his whole image was concerned.
Story_ID: 239113
Speaker 1: So you're, you're watching Nat [King] Cole.  You have great models, great role models.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The grooming that was occurring.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Because these men were very clean all the time.
Speaker 2: Grooming was the word of the day.  You don't go out the door unless--you know, you sleep in your do-rag, that's all it was for, to keep your hair in place.  You don't wear a do-rag in the street, okay.  You take that do-rag off, man, and get that comb and fix them waves and get that hair right.  And you got on a clean shirt, tie, and you got a nice suit from Brooks Brothers.
Speaker 1: Tailored.
Speaker 2: Tailored, yeah.  And then you shine your own shoes, and you can't go out unless them kicks were happening.  You know, them stomps got to be shined.  I mean, that's where I learned my trade.  Remember the shoeshine box I told you about at the barbershop?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And we all had our own shoeshine kits and what have you.  And the Stetsons, Bostonians, you know, Edwin Clapp--
Speaker 1: Stacy Adams.
Speaker 2: Wing-tipped Stacys.  Yeah, I got some.  I got some, I'm telling you.  I got about nine pairs of Stacy's and some Florsheims, you know.  We'd spend money, we'd save money to buy our own shoes.  I mean at that time they were like sixteen bucks [dollars], or fourteen bucks, or $12.95, you know.
Speaker 1: That was a lot of money then.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, wing tips, you know.  But you saved your money from shining shoes, you saved it.  But there was Nat Cole, and then there was the Nicholas Brothers [HistoryMaker Fayard Nicholas and Harold Nicholas], where we learned to dance from those guys, watching them dance.  The [Four] Step Brothers, Billy Ward and the Dominoes [sic. Billy Ward and His Dominoes].  Let's see, God, we had so many different people that we patterned ourselves after.  But it was all a wonderful--that's when the black entertainment was starting to filter out into a more--a worldwide television audience, you know.  You had people like [HistoryMaker] Della Reese[-Lett].  You had people like Dakota Staton, Dinah Washington, Pearl Bailey, you know.  Then of course, Dorothy Dandridge and all the different people like that.  And the more of these people that we saw, then it gave us, instilled in us enough sense of pride to continue, you know, our aspirations as performers.

Speaker 1: But besides school and singing, how else did you spend your spare time?  What else did you do?
Speaker 2: Well, actually there was not a lot of spare time.  And if I had any spare time, it was trying to--doing a job, you know.  Like I said, once I started in the barbershop it gave me sense of self-reliance of earning money, you know, trying to earn money, and drop a little change on Mom [Pearl Davis Turner], because Mom was working very hard, you know, to support three boys, you know, during those days.  But then I got jobs after school in my teens.  And we were singing with The Metrotones and we got little gigs, you know.  As a matter of fact we went as far as Canada, you know, London, Ontario [Canada].  We went to Toronto and Buffalo, New York.  And of course then we went to Canada from there.  But those were some great days, and some learning experiences.
Speaker 1: So now you're in high school [East Technical High School, Cleveland, Ohio], and you're getting toward the end of your high school career now?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now did you know what you wanted to do next?  Did you know what the next step for you was going to be?
Speaker 2: Entertainment, entertainment.
Speaker 1: So you didn't think about college?  You said, "I'm getting ready to sing."
Speaker 2: No.  I'm getting ready to sing.  (Laughter) I figured that college is the world.  You know, I would learn--my experience from life was very important to me.  Academics was very important.  I mean, of course, you got to, you got to learn.  In those days, you know, we didn't learn contracts.  We didn't learn the economics about signing contracts.  We were after the glory of becoming stars, and becoming performers.  But that's the only thing I regret about it, you know.  Because my aptitude was pretty good, you know, and I was starting to learn a lot of things about myself and about the world as I was in my neighborhood in Cleveland [Ohio] with the group, and then traveling around in different places singing and getting experience that way.
Speaker 1: What was your mother and grandmother [Queenie Davis] saying about your singing career, and where this might take you?  Because--
Speaker 2: They loved the singing, but they also wanted me to have academic skills, learn to read, learn mathematics.  And in those days, in the early years, my mother said "arithmetic."  (Laughter) And I learned to count.  I learned--and that way there's a certain dignity in learning--having academic skills, you know, and understanding things, you know.  But she said the best person you can be is a decent human being.
Story_ID: 239115
Speaker 1: So now you graduated from high school [East Technical High School, Cleveland, Ohio] in 1954?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Is that about right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's about right; just about right, yeah.
Speaker 1: And now you're still with The Metrotones?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now, what do you say?  You're out of high school now, so--
Speaker 2: And traveling around.
Speaker 1: So now you're traveling around.  Now the entertainment business, as we all know, has a lot of distractions that are available to you, should you choose to partake.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Talk about your stance, coming from a great family, you know, and seeing things that were available.  There was a lot going on, especially--I mean that's '55 [1955], '56 [1956].  You're in the middle of the bebop era now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Bebop and doo-wop.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you have, you have, you have Charlie Parker and his crew.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the things they're doing.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you have, you have the doo-wop groups.  What kept you out of trouble?
Speaker 2: What kept of trouble, kept me away from--well, you know, I was into, like I said, the glory of being able to perform and sing.  I learned growing up in Cleveland [Ohio], in the neighborhood, to stay away from drugs.  I learned that with so many things that happened in my younger years growing up with my brothers getting into all kind of trouble, okay, and drugs--seeing his friends.  And they were smoking, and then some of them were doing heroin.  One thing that really turned me against drugs--I came home from school, and Freddie [ph.], my older brother was in the house with his--I went to go the bathroom and he was in the bathroom with his buddy, and he had the--
Speaker 1: Called the works.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and they was doing drugs, Smitty [ph.].  Because he was a known addict, drug addict, and he had a needle.  It was the first time I ever saw a needle, and he was doing the drugs.  But he had one of the needles with the rubber syringe.  It was a rubber syringe eyedropper type of thing.  And I saw him doing his drugs, and I saw his face, and I saw his veins in his arms.  And I told my brother, I said, "I'm telling Mom [Pearl Davis Turner], I'm telling Mom."  I said, "If you do that, if you stick that needle, I'm telling Mom."  And I ran out of the room, I ran out of the house.  I ran out of the house, you know, and ran around to the barbershop.  And Mr. Fleming [ph.] and some of the other guys, "What you running from, boy?  What's the matter with you?"  And I was like breathing hard, and I said "Smitty is in my house with my brother."  And Skippy [ph.] put his clippers down, he was cutting hair.  He said, "I'll be back."  And he went and he took his--tied his--he had his barbershop--
Speaker 1: Smock on.
Speaker 2: Smock on.  He tied it up and put his razor in his pocket.  And he said, "You stay right there."  Because he was a great friend of all the kids, all of them guys in the barbershop.  And I think--what was that guy's name--nice and tall good-looking guy--he went with him around the corner.  He said, "We'll be back."  He said, "You stay here," and they went around the corner.  And the next thing I know, they got Smitty by the arm and brought him around to the front of the place, shoving him down the street.  "Don't you ever come back."  He's like, "Man," and he's all shot up and stuff.  And Skippy jumped on Freddy, you know.  He says--you know, he read him.  He jumped on him and he says, "All the things that you could do, and you bring that trash into your mother's house, as hard as she works to provide for y'all.  And you're the oldest one, you know."  Oh, he was on him.  Man, he riddled him verbally, gave him a verbal lashing.  He said, "You see that little boy in there?"  He said, "That's your little brother."  He said, "Do you want him to see that?"  You know, and that really turned me away from smoking grass--
Speaker 1: Earlier?
Speaker 2: --and doing pills.  Drugs was nothing but destructive, because I saw Smitty.  He later died, overdosed.  And everybody I saw that drank too much or had different problems, it was, it just brought you down.  It destroyed your life and your family's life.  So, that was my lesson.  That's how I was able to go through most of my entertainment life.  I drank a little bit as I got older, you know, what have you.  But drugs brought nothing but despair and tragedy.
Story_ID: 239116
Speaker 1: It's been told, especially in the jazz world, that a lot of the musicians or young people were trying to emulate people by doing what they did.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And it was known that Charlie Parker was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, and Billie Holiday, and people--
Speaker 2: Well, they thought that was the way to the secret of his talent.  It wasn't.  (Laughter) It wasn't.  The man played because he--I think he played because he could variate and play those notes and play his instrument because that was in his mind, and that's what he could play.  That's what he was feeling.
Speaker 1: There are stories where he told some people that he said he got mad when other people were doing drugs.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He actually just really got angry.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He saw some young person, and said, "Don't do this because I'm doing this."
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: One incident happened to me, since you mentioned that.  I don't mean to cut you off, but it brought to mind when I was working--after I left The Metrotones, the guys got drafted into the [U.S.] Army.  And I just kept on as an M.C. [master of ceremonies] and singer, opening up for Billie Holiday and Arthur Prysock.
Speaker 1: Where was this at?
Speaker 2: At the Chatterbox [Musical Bar and Grill] in Cleveland, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she--and I was going up to the stage, and she said, "Who is this boy, Arthur?"  You know, he was just telling her and talking to me.  She said, "Oh, so you dress nice."  She said, "I like the way you speak.  You know, you've learned how to present yourself."  And you know, she said, "Thank you for being here, you know."  She was nice to me.  And she said, "Do you smoke?"  I said, "No, Ma'am."  She said, "Do you drink?"  I said, "No, Ma'am."  She says, "You don't do drugs, do you?"  I said, "No."  This is Billie Holiday.  And she showed me the tracks.  She said, "You don't never want to see that."  I was standing, and Arthur Prysock was sitting where you're sitting.  And I was standing here, and she was standing where I'm sitting.  And Arthur Prysock said, "You get it?"  I said, "I got it, no drugs."  And ever since then, everybody I met, from Jackie Wilson, Guitar Slim, [HistoryMaker] B.B. King, Bill Doggett--I mean you could name all of them--Sarah Vaughan --everybody that I met, you know, said "Stay away from them drugs," you know, "stay away from them."  And maybe they was smoking or doing something themselves, but they said "You're clean-cut, I like you.  You know, stay that way."  They always had something good to say to me.
Speaker 1: So you were like the opening act at the Chatterbox?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was their opening M.C. and opening act.  And they let me do the first set, because the later night sets I couldn't do, you know, because I wasn't quite old enough.  I was going on seventeen, you know.  And--
Speaker 1: So now the guys are gone in The Metrotones.  They're gone, they're in the service.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you got your own little act rolling now.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah--
Story_ID: 239117
Speaker 1: Tell us about the Music Box [ph.].  You mentioned the Chatterbox [Musical Bar and Grill, Cleveland, Ohio].  But how about the Music Box?
Speaker 2: The Music Box was up on Euclid Avenue, 105th [Street] and Euclid [Cleveland, Ohio].  And I had, I'd worked all the little spots around town, you know.  Like, Gleason's [Musical Bar, Cleveland, Ohio] was my first stop.
Speaker 1: Now what was Gleason's?
Speaker 2: Gleason's was the musical night cabaret spot on 55th [Street] and Woodland [Avenue].  All the name acts came through there, you know.  I mean you could--every named act that was big at that time--rhythm and blues--came through Gleason's.  And then the Chatterbox was, there was a barbeque joint in the middle of Gleason's and the Chatterbox.  (Laughter) So, I worked, I remember a Mr. [William] "Jap" Gleason, they called him.  He and his sons ran Gleason's.  And [John] "Chin" Ballard, a big old former football player owned the Chatterbox.  They were good friends, good competition.  People would get barbeque, and then they'd go into Gleason's.  They'd get--go into whatever, you know, whoever was playing next door.  And that, that was my first beginnings.  And I worked my way around town, and then I worked the music at the Music Box downstairs.  And I was the opening act for Redd Foxx, and this was my, what they call my destiny job.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was working, doing the opening act for Redd Foxx.  And this was when a scout from Buck Ram who was the manager of The Platters, and a Clevelander by the way, by the name of Bill Crane, came into the Music Box to see Redd Foxx and caught my act.  And there I was on stage when he walked in.  And I was in the middle of doing a Jackie Wilson medley, and then I did a song by Dinah Washington.  I was doing a variety of music.  And that's--
Speaker 1: Let's talk about that for a moment, too.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Because it seems that nowadays, music is so compartmentalized.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Everybody back in the day listened to everything, didn't they?
Speaker 2: They did, every type of music.  And those of us who caught on to, followed in the footsteps of Nat [King] Cole and some of the great performers, learned to diversify, you know.  And not only for grooming, but you learned to conduct yourself with dignity, you know, in those days.  All that goes along with trying to be a star, or either an accepted person of quality on the stage.
Speaker 1: So the R&B artists respected the jazz artists, and the jazz artists respected the R&B?
Speaker 2: Big time, big time.
Speaker 1: And the radio stations, did they play all the music of every--
Speaker 2: Well, they had different nights, I mean different segments.  Like WJMO [Cleveland, Ohio] would come on and they'd play all the latest, the new R&B and the latest R&B.  Then they would have a disc jockey come on to take over for that night and play the jazz, you know, jazz.  What do they call that?  Bebop, you know.  They had, you know, King Pleasure. (Singing):  "There I go, there I go, there I go."
Speaker 1: And James Rudy.
Speaker 2: James Rudy [ph.] and the boys.  And King Pleasure was the one who sang that, and Rudy played for him.  But it was, it was, you know, it was nice, man.  And people like Dinah Washington, you know, Dakota Staton, and all those people.
Speaker 1: Now when they came to town, where did they stay?
Speaker 2: At the Majestic Hotel [Cleveland, Ohio] on Carnegie [sic. Central Avenue and 55th Street].
Speaker 1: And was that a black hotel?
Speaker 2: It was black, it was a black hotel.  As a matter of fact, it was, I think it was partly black-owned, you know.  But it was a very large--it took up the whole eight blocks, the Majestic Hotel.  And in the Majestic Hotel, of course, they had a nice bar.  And then they had what they called the Rose Room [Cocktail Lounge], and it was the entertainment room.  And in the Rose Room there was [Herman] "Duke" Jenkins and his trio, and they were excellent, fabulous guys.  And I used to sing with them, you know.  And if you got--when you moved up into the upper echelon, then you got gigs at the Majestic Hotel and worked the Rose Room.  And then they had a little, they had what they called back in the day exotic dancers.  And then they had a dance group, a troupe.  And I remember Tequila Davis [ph.] was one of the dancers that had her own show there, and I was the singer in her show.
Story_ID: 239118
Speaker 1: Let's go back to the fact that you met a lot of great people during these years right there, I mean great names like, say for instance Dinah Washington.  You mentioned her.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you meet Dinah Washington?
Speaker 2: Yes, I had the pleasure of meeting her.  I have pictures up there with her and Joel Taylor, and Maxine Brown, Herb Reed, myself, and my former wife, Arlean [Fairley].  And I had the pleasure of meeting Big Maybelle, Sil Austin, one of the great sax players of all time, Guitar Slim, Big Doggett, the Dominoes [Billy Ward and His Dominoes], Jackie Wilson, Chuck Jackson--god, Fats Domino, Bobby Day, you know--god, Big Joe Turner, Gator Tail Jackson [Willis Jackson].  Shoot man, Arthur Prysock, Red Prysock, his brother, Nellie Lutcher.
Speaker 1: It just goes on.
Speaker 2: The Flamingos, yeah.  God, you know.
Speaker 1: So you met these people and, as we say, you're honing your chops.  You're together now.  You get a little, you're known in Cleveland [Ohio] now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: People know you.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You've got a great show, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You're gigging.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, now you're down there opening for Redd Foxx.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: A great comedian--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --who was as big as any comedian at that point probably that we would know now.  He was, we'll say a Will Smith, or someone--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --on that level--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who's not a comedian, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he was--he was an icon in the--
Speaker 1: As Eddie Murphy?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, in those days, that's exactly right.  And during that time at the Music Box [ph.] of course I learned a lot of things from him, too.  (Laughter) He was a funny guy, on and off stage.
Speaker 1: How was he off stage?
Speaker 2: He was a nice guy, a real nice guy.  And he smoked a lot, of course.  I used to go out of the room because I didn't smoke.  And he pulled stuff on you, you know.  "Come here," you know, "Come here let me tell you something.  See that girl over there?"  I'd say "Yes."  "Don't talk to her, she's mine."  (Laughter) I'm, "What?" He says, "Well, she will be later," stuff like that, you know.  (Laughter) And he was nice to me, you know.
Story_ID: 239119
Speaker 1: So I'm out there, yeah, I'm opening for Redd Foxx.  I'm out there singing.  And when I finished my show and took my bow and what have you, I walked off, and this guy Bill Crane walks up to me.  He says, "How you doing?"  He introduced himself, and he says, "I really like, you know, I like your show."  I said, "Oh, thanks."  He said, "I especially like when you sing those ballads and some Jackie Wilson stuff."  He said, "My name is Bill Crane."  He says, "I'm from Cleveland [Ohio]."  He says, "I used to be a DJ myself, you know."   I said, "Really?"  He said, "Yeah."  He said, "Now, I'm an entrepreneur agent, booking agent and so forth."  He says, "I'm friends with a lot of the stars that you seem to emulate and that you like."  He said, "Do you like The Platters?"  I said, "Oh, do I like The Platters?"  I said, "We had a group called The Metrotones, and we patterned ourselves after The Platters, man, the great Platters."  He said, "Well," he says, "Tony Williams--."  I said, "Yeah, Tony Williams."  And he said, "Well, you know, he's leaving the group."  I said, "Well, I read about it, you know."  I said, "I heard about it.  Is it true?"  He said, "Yeah, it's true."  I said, "Wow."  I couldn't imagine, you know.
Speaker 2: Why was he leaving the group?
Speaker 1: He was seeking a solo career and some other things that, you know, that I don't want to expound about.  But there were differences, okay, let's put it that way, contractual differences.  And he said, "Well, yeah, it's true, he's leaving the group."  He says, "Buck Ram is a good friend of mine, and I'm helping him scout.  I'm scouting for a lead singer to replace Tony Williams."  I said, "Really?"  I said "Wow."  He said, "I think you could sing lead for The Platters."  I said, "What?"  (Laughter) And I said, "Yeah, right."  I said, "Sign me up."  (Laughter) He said, "No, I'm serious."  I said, "You're serious?"  I said, "The Platters?"  I said, 'The' Platters?"  He said, "Yes, I think you could sing lead for The Platters."  He said, "You've got the timbre in your voice."  He says, "It's," he says, "I'll tell you what."  He says, "Here's my card."  He said, "Would you come and meet with me in my office?"  He says, "I've got an office on Prospect Avenue."  And he says, "I'd like to talk to you about it, and I'm serious about that."  So I said, "Well, okay."  I took his card and I thought about it.  I said, "Now this guy, he gave me a card, so maybe he's legit."  Anyway, that night I went and talked to my mother [Pearl Davis Turner] about it when I went home.  And she said, "You got everything to gain and nothing to lose."  She said, "Go see him," you know.  So I went to go see him.  I went and saw him and talked to him, and he explained to me what the deal was.  Tony was leaving for a solo career, and blah, blah, blah.  And he says, "We got a few people.  We auditioned a lot of people."  He said, "But I'd like to have Buck Ram listen to you."  He said, "Now, you seem to have your act together professionally."  You know, because I had about three or four suits, and my patent leather shoes.  And I'd learned to be a professional.  And I had music charts, you know.  I had a repertoire and I had charts and everything, and pictures and a bio.  And he said, "Oh, you--."  He was looking at my bio.  And I had some nice photographs.  And he said, "You kind of look like Tony Williams," you know. (Laughter) I said, "Yeah?  You think so?"  He said, "Do me a favor."  He said, "Would you, would you like to make some demos for me, just some demos?  I'd like to send them out to Buck and let him hear how you sound."  He said, "Your photograph speaks for itself."  And I said, "Well, it can't hurt."  I said "Fine.  You know, these are just demos, right, not recordings?"  He said, "Just demos," you know.  And I went over and he asked me to sing 'Smoke Gets in Your Eyes' and sing a couple of other songs, you know.  And I did them, and he sent the demos out.  He said "Now, look, I'm going to send these to Buck Ram.  What's your schedule like?" I said, "Well, I'm in town, you know.  I'm here with Redd Foxx for another week, and I have some other dates and private--you know, some parties."  I said, "But I'm not signed to a contract with anybody.  I don't have a recording contract."  And he said, "Good, good."  He sent it out to Buck Ram, and two weeks later Buck Ram called him up and said, "Get ahold of that kid."  He said, "I'd like to have you bring him to Milwaukee [Wisconsin], I'd like to meet him in person.  And I'd like to hear him sing in person."  This is what Bill told me that Buck told him on the phone.  When I got to Bill Crane's office, he explained all this to me.  And he said, "Can you go to Milwaukee?"  I said, "Yeah, but I don't have, I don't think I have money to go to a hotel and all that."  He said, "I'll, we'll pay the expenses."  And he said, "Bring your music, a couple of songs and one of your suits."  He said, "Dress like you normally dress."  He said, "You dress real nice."  I said, "Okay."  I got a night train, and in those days you traveled either by Greyhound or on a train.  I went to Milwaukee and checked in the hotel.  He said, "Bring your music."  And I got all suited up, ties and everything.  And I got my "do" together and went down with Bill Crane to this club called Henry's [ph.].  And he said, "Buck Ram wants to meet you in person."  And I said, "Oh, great, okay."  We went down there, and as we walked through the door I could see it was like a swank nightclub type of thing, you know.  And I said, "Whoa."
Speaker 2: And what year would this be, about?
Speaker 1: This is '59 [1959].
Story_ID: 239120
Speaker 1: Late '59 [1959].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I, I said the only place I see like this is like--you know, other places I'd been weren't quite as swank as this, you know, uptown type of thing.  And I said, "This is all right, this is great," you know.  And I walked in, and of course I was nervous.  And he said, "Buck Ram said meet him here."  And he said, "Oh, there they are over there."  And they were sitting in a long booth, a wide booth.  And I could see Buck Ram sitting there with his wife Lucille, and Jeanie Bennett, his secretary.  Zola Taylor was sitting sort of in the middle, with Paul Robi, David Lynch, and Herb Reed.  Tony Williams wasn't at the table.  I said, "Damn, the real Platters."  (Laughter) I said "Whoa!"  And I went over and he says, "Buck, how you doing?"  He says, "Oh, hi."  He says, "How are you?"  He says, "This is the kid from Cleveland [Ohio]," just like that.  And everybody turned to me, you know, looked at me, and I went "Oh, boy."  And I said, "Hi, hello, everybody."  And everybody shook my hand and made me feel welcome, you know.  "How you doing?"  "Fine."  He says, "Now, look."  He says, "I want to introduce you to Rupert Branker."  He was their musical conductor, a pianist.  And he got Rupert Branker to come out, and Rupert came out.  He was real nice to me, you know.  He says, "Look, Rupert said take [HistoryMaker] Sonny [Turner] backstage."  The piano was in the dressing room.  He said, "Do a couple of songs, I'd like to hear you sing."  He said, "Would you like to sing for us?"  I said, "Yes, I would love to sing for you, you know."  And we went backstage, and Rupert said "Don't be nervous."  I said, "Oh, that's easy for you to say," you know.  And he said, "What do you want to sing?"  I said "I don't know."  He says, "I have four songs."  And he said, "Buck wants you to sing 'Smoke Gets in Your Eyes.'" I said, "He what?"  "He wants you to sing 'Smoke Gets in Your Eyes.'"  I said, "The Platters are playing here, and you want me to sing 'Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,' with Tony Williams in the house?"  (Laughter)  I said, "No, no, no."  He said, "No, it's okay.  It's been explained to the audience."  The place was packed, you know, The Platters' audience.  He said, "Well, I'll introduce you, and I'll explain."  So he explained to the audience, "We have a young man here that's going to sing while The Platters are doing their break, and we'd like you ladies and gentleman to give him your attention.  He's a friend of ours, and dropped in from Cleveland.  Sonny Turner is his name, and he wants to sing a couple of songs for you."  And oh, they clapped, "Hey, okay, all right."  And it was just Rupert and I and the drummer.  Because you know, they couldn't use the horn section because I didn't have any horn charts.  And they started playing, and I was like hearing my mother's [Pearl Davis Turner] voice saying "You can do it, you can do this.  You can do this."
Speaker 2: Was she there with you?
Speaker 1: No, no.  No, she was in Cleveland.  She had been sick, and unfortunately--I'll tell you about that later.  So they got me through it, and I started singing, right.  And once I started singing, I got comfortable.  They said "Do what you normally do.  Do your thing, man."  And I'm up there doing my stuff, you know.  And I got a lot of applause on the first song, and they said "Now sing 'Smoke Gets in Your Eyes.'"  And I said oh, man.  (Laughter) So, I sang most of it with my eyes closed, but I got through it really well, and I got a big hand for that.  And they said, "Encore, encore.  One more, one more."  And I said--Rupert looked at me and said--you know--so I did a little Jackie Wilson for them, you know.  And I walked off the stage, and Rupert grabbed my hand and says "Yeah."  He said "Yeah, you did great," you know.  And my knees were shaking, you know.  (Laughter) And so I walked past the piano through the curtain, and there were some steps, you know.  And I was going down the steps, and there stood Tony Williams.  And that's all I needed, right.  I said, oh, man.  He's six feet tall.  I didn't know he was that tall, a nice-looking guy, dressed really nice.  And I looked at him, and he looked at me like--and then he started laughing, you know.  He stuck his hand out and said, "You did great, man."  He hit me on the shoulder and he says, "You really did it.  You sound good.  You did good, really good."  He said, "I like what I heard."  So after that I went with Bill Crane, and I sat at a table.  And Buck said, "Well, let's go and talk about this.  Can you travel?  Are you tired?"  Da da, da da.  And I said, "No, I'm free."  Anyway, they had a meeting after their gig, in the dressing room.  I come out, they hired me that night.
Story_ID: 239121
Speaker 1: So you get hired on the spot, in the dressing room, by The Platters to replace the lead singer Tony Williams.
Speaker 2: Yeah, unbelievable.
Speaker 1: Now, at this moment you've been a local legend, so to speak.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: A local hero.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But now the big-time is facing you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You're married and you have children at this point.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have two.
Speaker 1: What's going through your mind?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, it was like it was hard to understand--not understand, but hard to realize the magnitude right away.  I was so taken aback because I knew this was the real deal.  Here's the great Platters, and coincidentally we fashioned our group [The Metrotones] after The Platters.  And here I am as the lead singer for The Platters, supposedly.  And I said to myself, "Man, this is a dream that's come too true, too real, you know.
Speaker 1: One of those Case-Woodland [School, Cleveland, Ohio] window moments, huh?
Speaker 2: That's right, exactly.  (Laughter) I said, "Well, this is what you wished for.  Be careful what you wish for.  Are you ready for this?"  And I kept saying--then doubt--you know, can I do this?  And I didn't--you know, am I going to make my mother [Pearl Davis Turner] proud?  Am I going to make myself proud?  Am I going to--you know, and all the experience that I've had comes into play, and I said "You got up there and sang for them, didn't you, you know?  This is who you are.  This is what you've been dreaming about, those days when you got slapped on the knuckles for looking out the window.  This is when you imagined yourself on stage under the spotlight, you know.  And you've been in the nightclub circuit before.  You've been on stage in front of the spotlight.  You can do this, you know."
Speaker 1: So for the next--let's talk about the post-acceptance period, when you--okay, you got the gig now?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you go back home?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You get back on the train and go back to Cleveland [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you tell all the people in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well, that's after I went with The Platters.  I didn't go back to Cleveland.
Speaker 1: Oh, you didn't?
Speaker 2: They took me with them to Cincinnati [Ohio].
Speaker 1: Right there on the spot.
Speaker 2: They took me with them on the night train to Cincinnati, Ohio.  They played in Covington, Kentucky across the river in a casino the first time.
Speaker 1: Covington, right?
Speaker 2: Covington.
Speaker 1: And you got no break to even go back and--
Speaker 2: No, over the telephone.
Speaker 1: What did you do?  You called back and told--
Speaker 2: Mom said, "Go, go, go."
Speaker 1: What did your wife say?
Speaker 2: Well, it was--earlier we had separated because of certain things that happened, you know.  But we had two pretty little girls, and I said, "Ah, now, that's support."  I mean now I can--you know, because I was like supporting them, but it was like, you know, from paycheck to paycheck support.
Speaker 1: Now there was some breathing room?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I was like, "Oh, boy, now I can send those little dresses, and all the nice things I can do for them, you know, for my little girls.  And in the interim their mother and I had separated, and later on divorced.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, because we got married young, but we--I still stayed true to the fact that what a man does is take care of his family, his responsibilities.  That was instilled in me not only from my family, but in the neighborhood, the men and women in the neighborhood.  So this was an opportunity to show that I can really do something.
Story_ID: 239122
Speaker 1: --You leave right now?
Speaker 2: Right now.
Speaker 1: And you're on the first gig.  Tell us about it.
Speaker 2: Well, the first gig was in Huntington [ph.], because I had to rehearse with them.  I rehearsed with them for two weeks, it was a two-week gig, and that was Tony's [Tony Williams] last two weeks.  And my aptitude of learning, of knowing The Platters' music, too, and the style, and being able to perform with a group--I was a group singer, you know.  And so that helped me a lot.  And then I could dance, you know, I was a pretty good dancer.  And the choreography was a lot smoother and more restrained, as you might say, you know.  They didn't do a lot of like [The] Temptations choreography, you know.  It was regimented, but it was smooth and classy movements, you know.
Speaker 1: So you have this classy group, The Platters.  How did they accept you in the group, and how did they--
Speaker 2: Well, they accepted me with a positive--they wanted to instill in me a welcome feeling, and get my mind right so that I could join, so that I would be a part of what they were doing.  Then once they saw that I was capable and I was a group singer--that I was the lead singer no less--and that I had the ability to sing and I could remember the songs, you know, then I could remember the choreography.  So that was a big help, you know.
Speaker 1: Were you the youngest in the group now?
Speaker 2: I was the baby, except Zola [Taylor] was a year older than me.  And that really helped me be prepared.  All the experience before that helped me to work with The Platters.  And that first gig after that two-week rehearsal was Washington, D.C. at the Club Lotus [The Lotus, Washington, D.C.], and it was opening night.  And this was a very swank, classy--the kind you see in the movies nightclub, you know, waiters and a shish-kebob of flames, and all that business.  And people dressed to the nines--fur coats, you know, diamond rings--high class people.  Closing that night before we opened was Sammy Davis, Jr.  That ought to tell you something.  And I said, "Holy mackerel, I am in it for real."  And I think that night I kind of flubbed the words on 'Twilight Time' because I was like--you know, I was singing--we opened with 'The Great Pretender,' '[(You've Got) the] Magic Touch,' 'Harbor Lights,' 'Twilight Time,' and then we did some dancing.  We did 'Dance All Night,' [sic. 'Love All Night'] and Zola and David [Lynch] did a number together.  And then Zola sang 'He's Mine,' and Herb [Reed] and her did a dance number.  Then [Paul] Robi sang a number, and then we did 'Smoke Gets in Your Eyes' as a closer.  And it was a strong set.  And I was accustomed to big bands, because we had won the all-city contest with The Metrotones and we got a chance to work on the stage with the big band, Buddy Johnson's band.  And Ella Johnson was singing with the band, and we got a chance to work with [The] Moonglows and The Five Keys.  So I was accustomed to big bands, you know, the show business.  And boy, it was fantastic.  I mean I got through that night, and that sewed it up for me.  I said, "Bam, I can do this, man, you know."
Story_ID: 239123
Speaker 1: The Platters are a household name at that point?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: World renowned.
Speaker 1: And how was life traveling with them?  How was life?  You know, because there was a lot of racial tension--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the country.  But how was it like traveling with The Platters?
Speaker 2: Well, Cincinnati [Ohio] was, you know, kind of--a lot of that kind of thing going on, racial things.  But in The Platters' status, it afforded them--they were not above it, but acceptance in a lot of places, you know, a lot of things.  What was--the structure organization of The Platters was, alright, since things are like they are, we went across the line in a lot of places.  Like in the dressing rooms, you know, we kind of kept to ourselves, you know.  You stayed in the dressing room or either you kind of congregated in the blue room, what have you.  And then people would ask to meet you, and you would go out and meet them with the manager and what have you.  A couple of us sat at his table, you know.  Things were kind of lax for The Platters because they were such an iconic, you know, group in the business.  And we ran into it sometimes, you know, on some of the tours we did.
Speaker 1: Any particular incidents?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  We were, we went on tour in '61 [1961] with Brook Benton, The Drifters, The Jarmels, Gene McDaniels, Gary U.S. Bonds, you know.  And we did, we stayed across town, we couldn't stay downtown.
Speaker 1: What town was this is?
Speaker 2: Well, this was in the south.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were going through Tennessee and Missouri and Georgia, and places like that.  We had to stay like across town, actually across the tracks, in rooming houses.  Because a lot of places, they had, they had designated all the places where the black acts could stay.
Speaker 1: Even in 1961?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Still going on?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  And we--one incident, we were--we stopped at a truck stop.  And I think The Shirelles, one of The Shirelles, was grabbed by a truck driver, and then the guys came off the bus and did a number on the truck driver.  (Laughter) I mean, and the police came and they got on the bus.  "We want to know who was the ones that jumped this truck driver, "Blah, blah, blah, blah," and all that.  He said, "He grabbed one of our girls and was abusive, and he got his ass whipped."  (Laughter) We put it like that.  And some of the guys on the bus were like, you know, "Don't get on this bus because you got a gun," you know.  "You won't get off the bus, you know."  In other words we had, there was a certain amount of dignity among the black men, you know, looking out for the--you know.  And we weren't going to stand for being mistreated, whether you got a gun or not, you know.  And that incident kind of cooled off, because the manager, the road manager, you know, talked to the guy.  And one of the cops was a pretty nice guy.  He said "That guy got what he deserved, you know.  Let's go."  And they went and talked to the truck driver, and they said, "You best get in your truck and get the hell out of here," you know.  And they said, "You're lucky to be alive, there's a bus full of them (laughter)."
Speaker 1: Do you think the status of who--of them realizing who you were helped a lot with that?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  Because he got--those guys, those cops were like music lovers, you know.  They got on our bus and they wanted to know what happened, you know.  And they pretty much figured, you know--but they wanted to know--they had to show some kind of authority.  And there'd been incidents where I've been stopped and the police, you know, recognize you and they go "Give me an autograph.  If I tell my wife I stopped you and didn't get an autograph, she'd kill me."  You know, I'd give the guy, you know, give him a record, you know, a 33-1/3 back in those days.  The guy said, "Man, if you ever have any problems give me a call."  (Laughter) You know, that kind of thing.  But most of the times--we'd been shot at.
Speaker 1: Where?
Speaker 2: We were shot at.  We were, we saw the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] signs, you know, "Stamp out integration," that kind of thing.  And we saw--we got out and took pictures with us under the sign.  (Laughter) And we saw some incidents--
Story_ID: 239124
Speaker 1: Well, how about your first overseas trip with The Platters?
Speaker 2: That was something that was like dream come true.  We goin to England, you know, and play the [London] Palladium [London, England], you know, Her Majesty, a command performance.  And we played this, we did a television show called 'Amundo Ross's Night of the Stars' [ph.] or something like that, it was called.  And I remember getting into Heathrow Airport [Hillingdon, London, England], man, and going, "England, I want to see Big Ben, you know."  And all of the attractions that tourists would--I was locked up, trying to--you know, and going up and down Piccadilly Square [Piccadilly Circus, London, England] and different places like that, being on that show.  And there's a picture on the wall there with Barbara McNair, who was playing in a nightclub and we went to see her.  David [Lynch], Herb [Reed], and I went to see Barbara McNair in the nightclub.  It was great, it was fabulous.
Speaker 1: How was the social acceptance overseas?
Speaker 2: Really nice.  As a matter of fact, a little bit more acceptance than home.  I mean after all, Josephine Baker, who was one of the great entertainers, had to leave home to really become a great national star.
Speaker 1: Many jazz musicians went, too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and Dorothy Dandridge, all of them, a lot of jazz musicians.
Speaker 1: Dexter Gordon.
Speaker 2: A lot of the--The [Four] Step Brothers, Billy Daniels, and all the great, you know, black artists were accepted, you know, back in Europe more readily, you know.  Because they loved jazz, and back in the day jazz was like--man, you know.  And the black artists of every category of music, you know, excelled in Europe and Japan and different places, you know.
Speaker 1: So now you've gotten with The Platters.  And just prior to that, you had got drafted.  But I think you were able to get around it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was drafted.  And at that particular time President [John Fitzgerald] Kennedy passed an exemption law for any male member that was drafted into the [U.S.] Army with more than one child.  And at that time I had two little girls, and that got me an exemption, you know.  But otherwise I was-- been in the Army, you know, I would have been in there singing away.
Story_ID: 239125
Speaker 1: How long were you in The Platters?
Speaker 2: Twelve years.
Speaker 1: And that twelve year experience, what did that do for your family life--your home?  Your mom [Pearl Davis Turner] and everybody, what were they saying?  Now, their son is in The--
Speaker 2: Well, when I joined The Platters back in the day, when I told you, I went with them from Milwaukee [Wisconsin].  And I was with them rehearsing and whatever, and my mom passed away.  And so she knew that I had gotten to a certain place in my career.
Speaker 1: She passed away during the time that--
Speaker 2: I had just got with The Platters.  I had just gotten that break.
Speaker 1: And she was one of your major cheerleaders.
Speaker 2: 'The' cheerleader.
Speaker 1: Do you think that it was ironic, that it was a transition of life for you as she was leaving, that you might have been going into your dream?  Do you think that had--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you see any connections with that?
Speaker 2: I think it was--yeah, I think it was her prayers and her wish for me being the youngest sibling, and knowing how I wanted to sing, and how I was, you know, aspiring to be a singer, a performer, an entertainer.  I think that she left this world knowing that I was well.
Speaker 1: Do you think she was like, okay, now he's here, and I can transcend into another realm now?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you think--
Speaker 2: Something like that.  And I think that she's been around checking me out, you know.  (Laughter) Over my shoulder, you know.
Story_ID: 239126
Speaker 1: You were with The Platters for twelve years?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You're still based, your home was still Cleveland [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Cleveland, yeah.
Speaker 1: Cleveland.  So now you've been on the road internationally and everywhere?
Speaker 2: I've had to move to--during that time my home was in Cleveland.  When the young lady I was married to--when we were teenagers we had separated and divorced.  And then I married a young lady, another lady from Cleveland, who I married in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and she went with me to L.A.  So--
Speaker 1: You went to L.A.?
Speaker 2: I was in L.A. with The Platters.  Most of The Platters, all of The Platters were from L.A.
Speaker 1: So that's like late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: No, early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Early '60s [1960s], '59 [1959] through that transition period into '60 [1960].  Then I met Arlean [Fairley] and we, you know, became married, whatever.  And we moved, she followed me to L.A., because I had to go to L.A. to live, where The Platters rehearsed and recorded and all that.
Speaker 1: So, how was that experience?  Now you're in Hollywood.  How was that?
Speaker 2: Hollywood, man, that was during the era of the nightclub circuits and all the--what do you call--what do they call it now?  Just going into the '70s [1970s] era with the Eduardo look, you know, and all that.  And I saw, I met a lot of stars, movie stars, and I was going to these different parties in Beverly Hills [California] and down in the [San Fernando] Valley [California] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, how was that experience?  Because you had come from like, you know, this steel town pretty much.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, Cleveland was very industrial, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now you're out here in--
Speaker 2: Hollywood.
Speaker 1: In Hollywood.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was everything I read about mostly, and things I didn't read about, you know, meeting some of the movie stars that I used to--that I actually saw on the silver screen, you know, and some of the big name entertainers.  And it was really quite an experience.  It was a--it was Dorothy going over the rainbow.
Speaker 1: Where in L.A. did you live?  What do you call it?
Speaker 2: I lived off of La Brea, Washington [Boulevard] and La Brea [Avenue].  At first I was staying in the hotels, you know, kitchenettes and whatever, until I got a place to live.  And then Zola [Taylor] helped me get a place to stay, you know.  And then when Arlean came out, we got married in [Las] Vegas [Nevada], in a Las Vegas church.  And David [Lynch] and Zola came, and [Paul] Robi, you know, and different members of The Platters.  And then Herb Reed gave me, he had a duplex, and he gave me the duplex next to him for fifty dollars a week, you know.  And so, Herb and I became good friends.
Speaker 1: Right now in that area there's a great theater now, the Nate Holden Center for Performing Arts [Nate Holden Performing Arts Center, Los Angeles, California], right there at Washington and Le Brea now.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: And I think it was once owned by the guy that played one of the 'Amos and Andy' ['Amos 'n' Andy']--
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: --one of the black men that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That area still has performing arts going on.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Right there, yes.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: So, you're with them for twelve years?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: You're then L.A. based?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: You're married to your second wife now?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And are there any more children?
Speaker 2: One boy, yes.  His name is Jason [Turner].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he lives here in Las Vegas with his wife and children.
Speaker 1: Is he a musician?
Speaker 2: No, no.  He's a cool dude.  (Laughter) He's a nice guy, he's a sweetheart, and his wife is just as sweet as she can be, you know.  And so my two, my two daughters--one, my oldest girl lives here with her son.  And she manages McDonald's over on, where is it?  Up near (long pause) Decatur [Boulevard, Las Vegas, Nevada].
Story_ID: 239127
Speaker 1: You stay with them [The Platters] for twelve years.  What caused--now did the group break up, or did you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the interim of traveling all over the world--South America, Japan--I mean I traveled everywhere--to Africa, you know, Poland.  And during that time there were things happening in the group, and there was a lot of dissension that reared its ugly head, in differences.  And unfortunate things happened, you know, with the personality clashes.  And it got to the point where Zola [Taylor] left first.  Then Paul Robi left, and he and Zola started a Platters group.  David Lynch stayed with us for a while and then he was the last to leave of those three.  And he left finally and he joined those two.  And we acquired a girl named Sandra Dawn from the New York area, and Nate Nelson, who used to sing lead for The Flamingos, you know, the voice on (singing) "My love must be a kind of a blind love."  That's his voice, Nate Nelson, a primo singer, you know, one of the great lead voices.  He was the lead singer for The Flamingos.  And so it was Herb, myself, Nate Nelson, Sandra Dawn.  And after David left, then we got a couple of other different guys, you know, down the line.  And pretty soon Buck Ram and Herb had their differences.  I had one year to go on my contract with The Platters, Incorporated, and after that year was up I left, because things started to disintegrate quality-wise.
Speaker 1: Now, do you think that the--that's like the late '60s [1960s] or early '70s [1970s].  Do you think that the music in general, the business at that point, was going through a transition which may have caused strain on the group?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Because now, you've got, you've got guys at Woodstock [Festival; Woodstock Music & Art Fair].
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Jimi Hendrix is doing his thing.  Disco is right around the corner.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The Motown sound--
Speaker 2: Is happening.
Speaker 1: --is heavy.
Speaker 2: The Beatles invasion.
Speaker 1: Right.  So do you think this had any effect on the way the music was presented?  Because now--
Speaker 2: No, no.  I think The Platters, had they stayed together and realized the big picture--we were putting out music to accommodate the transition of time.  Like the hits I had with The Platters, I had a hit with 'I Love You [A] Thousand Times,' written for me by Luther Dixon and Inez Foxx, you know.  And they had Scepter Records at that time; they were the big thing there in those days.  And there was Phil Spector, you know, and they wrote three hit records.  'With This Ring' was written by Richard Wylie, they call him Popcorn Wylie.  And then we had 'Washed Ashore,' which was another hit for me.  And then I re-recorded everything Tony [Williams] had recorded.  And then what happened was, with the change of the music era, had we stuck with the recordings the way we were doing them when I had the hits, and kept the lush recording sounds--orchestrated sounds of The Platters--I think we would have had more hit records.  Because I recorded some real nice music, and they were standards and they could have been hit records.  Buck Ram got into a fight, a contractual dispute with Mercury [Records].  Then The Platters left Mercury and went to Musicor [Records], and then there was another deal with the contract.  People got greedy, and subsequently the whole thing went all to--and then '70 [1970] came around and I left The Platters, Incorporated.  Buck Ram went and put together a whole other Platter group, and that was the end of that.
Story_ID: 239128
Speaker 1: So in the '70s [1970s]--okay, so this is a golden era for you.  Your dream--but you've done it for a dozen years now.  So--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: So I'm sure you're somewhat, you know, a bit disappointed?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: But what is your next plan?  What do you decide to do at that point?
Speaker 2: To continue on to be creative, now that I know more about what I'm doing contractually.  There are still pitfalls, you know, in everything you do, because there's unscrupulous people no matter where you go, you know.  The devil is busy, like my mother [Pearl Davis Turner] would say.  (Laughter) The devil is busy.  But I feel elated, I feel a great deal of inspiration from my knowledge of what I've learned, what I know, and what I still can do.  I feel a great deal of gratitude that God has blessed me to be able to still be able to sing.  I still got my chops, I still have my inspiration, you know.
Speaker 1: And at that point, the Sonny Turner [and] Sound Limited group starts at that point, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: Who is in that group?
Speaker 2: I had some guys from Cleveland [Ohio].  And one of the guys, Leonard Veal, went on to become the lead singer for The Hesitations, and he two hit records with The Hesitations himself.
Speaker 1: 'Born Free'?
Speaker 2: 'Born Free,' yeah.  And 'Ebb Tide.'  Was it 'Ebb Tide'?  I think it was 'Ebb Tide,' one of the big numbers that he recorded with them that they had a hit record on.  But it was all good, you know.  And Leonard was with me, and a guy from North Carolina.  I had different singers at different times, because people for one reason or another had to--you know, as people will be--they come and go.
Speaker 1: So now, are you managing yourself at this point?
Speaker 2: I'm managing myself, Sonny Productions.
Speaker 1: And booking the band yourself?
Speaker 2: Sonny Productions is booking [HistoryMaker] Sonny [Turner], and I have two great agents.  And the people that have known me throughout the years in different venues will book me, because they know my work--
Story_ID: 239129
Speaker 1: And so in the '70s [1970s] you're moving around.  Are you playing locally, or are you still traveling with the band?
Speaker 2: I played locally here with [Sonny Turner and] Sound Limited, and then I won a showcase with my group.  And then that's history.  And from then on I played mostly every hotel here in Las Vegas [Nevada].
Speaker 1: Yeah, explain that transition.  So the band is basically based out of L.A. [Los Angeles, California] because you're still there, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, out of L.A.  Right, you're right.
Speaker 1: So, you get an audition or a showcase opportunity here in Vegas?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you all come over?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we come over and we do the audition at The Sahara [Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Sandy Hackett, Buddy Hackett's son, was doing a showcase every Saturday and Sunday.  And the people that had known me from before, having been with The Platters who appeared in the showroom here at The Flamingo [Las Vegas, Nevada] in Las Vegas--old school--I was in good shape, because I was known in Vegas for some of the venues, and the entrepreneurs here knew me.
Speaker 1: So what year would that have been when you did the showcase?
Speaker 2: That was around '72 [1972], '73 [1973], something like that when we did the showcase.  And we came here actually for a little R and R from Phoenix [Arizona].  We did a gig in Phoenix, the Sound Unlimited, and we came here.  And I went over to the Sahara to say hi to some of the guys.  And they said, "Oh, we got a showcase.  You got your band with you?  You still doing music?"  I said, "Yeah, I got my whole group here."  He said, "Well, Sandy Hackett, you ought to go talk to him.  He's got a showcase tomorrow night.  Are you going to be in town?"  I said, "Yeah, we're here for a couple of days."  And I went over to talk to Sandy, and he said "Hey, yeah, man."  He says, "[HistoryMaker] Sonny Turner of The Platters?"  "Yeah."  He said, "You got a group?"  I said, "Yeah."  He said, "Well, would you like to do my showcase?"  And I said, "Yeah."  I did the showcase, and we won a two-week engagement at the Sahara.
Speaker 1: Explain to the audience the importance of winning that showcase, and what a two-week engagement at the Sahara really meant in terms of your status.
Speaker 2: It meant connection to all the venues that could elevate your career in Las Vegas, Nevada, and meeting all of the great performers here during my time having been with The Platters, and then coming back as Sonny Turner and Sound Limited on my own and re-establishing myself.  And it meant a great deal to win that showcase, because that two weeks gave us another two weeks.  And then we left there and went to the Hilton chain, and starting working with the Hilton chain.  It was the International [Hotel; Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada] then, when Elvis [Presley] was in town.  And the people that had known me from then had came and saw me.  And then we had other showcases where I could invite different agents and entertainment directors from around town, and they saw me.  So that led to one hotel venue, one venue to another.  And I had two weeks here, three weeks here, four weeks here.  And then that history brought my career and my name up to a certain status in Las Vegas.
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet Elvis Presley?
Speaker 2: I met Elvis, got a belt from him.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Elvis, well, this was like, it was the International Hotel; they were just making the transition.  As a matter of fact, they were just building the International before it became the [Las Vegas] Hilton.  And Elvis was a Platter fan.  So we were working in the Bird Cage Lounge [ph.] opposite Little Anthony and the Imperials, myself and Rip Taylor.  And so most of the stars would come by the lounge, because after their shows, you know, people like [Dan] Rowan and [Dick] Martin would walk in.  Tom Jones would walk in, or whomever, they would come through.  And they'd stick their head in the door and they'd walk in and sit down.  A lot of times they would walk up to the stage.  The stage was over the bar, and they'd walk up to the bar and they'd look at you and they'd go, "Turn it down, I'm trying to gamble out here," you know, just to mess with you, to kibitz with you or whatever.  And they'd come backstage and they'd walk across the stage while you were singing, you know, stuff like that, you know.  And one time Johnny Mathis came in and he walked, he got up and came through the door and walked out from behind the stage.  And I'm out there singing, and he's pulling my microphone cord, you know, and stuff like that.  Sammy Davis, Jr. would walk in and sit in with you.

Speaker 1: So, you're doing your gig in the hotel [International Hotel; Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And people are coming through, great names are coming through.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, you know, there's a camaraderie among entertainers.
Speaker 2: Then, it was just that--these big stars were like your big brothers and sisters.  They'd come around and give you support, you know, and they'd bring people in.  A couple of incidents that I remember very well, was we were, we were performing at The Sahara [Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada], and Johnny Mathis came through, you know.  And they go by--you go up to the dressing room and go through--the bar was in the showroom, it was kind of facing this way.  And you go in, and you go back through a door and go up to the stage to the upstairs dressing rooms.  And they would sneak in and they'd get up behind the curtain, and they'd walk out in front of you, "Taxi."  (Laughter) They know you'd be singing, and they go, "Oh, excuse me.  Were you guys singing?"
Speaker 1: And the audience is cracking up?
Speaker 2: They're cracking up.  And they know the whole skit, you know, because they--the place would get crowded with people late after the main room show, because they know--
Speaker 1: Somebody's coming.
Speaker 2: Somebody's coming to mess with the performers.  And who was it that walked right up, got up on the bar and walked across?  Was it--not Rich Little, I forgot.  It was Sandy Hackett who came on a couple of times.  His dad?
Speaker 1: Buddy Hackett.
Speaker 2: Buddy Hackett, you know, stood up on the bar stool and got up and walked across the bar and goes, "Oh, what's going on behind that curtain?"  You know, they stopped the music.  "Mr. Hackett, how you doing?  Buddy Hackett, ladies and gentleman.  There's nothing going on behind that curtain."  "There's nothing going on in front of it, either."  (Laughter) Stuff like that, you know.
Speaker 1: How about Elvis [Presley]?
Speaker 2: Elvis, we, this was--now here's an incident.  Okay, I was with The Platters.  Now let me go back to The Platters days in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were performing at, headlining at The Flamingo [Las Vegas, Nevada].  That's when Kirk Kerkorian had that one hotel that we knew of anyway.  But I had a chance to meet Mr. Kerkorian, a real nice man.  And I'm standing here talking to a multi-billionaire, you know.  But we were performing in the 600-seat cabaret.  It wasn't a lounge then, it was a cabaret.  Performing was The Platters, The Mills Brothers, Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, Wayne Cochran, the different named performers that came through, and Sly and the Family Stone.  And one night what happened, Tony Martin was a big star back in those days when he was married to Cyd Charisse, a movie star, you know.  They say he got, he was ill.  And so they said, "We got to have one of the performers out at the show.  Get The Platters, they're hot."  So they put us in the showroom, we were headlining.  And I never will forget, The Platters are in the showroom and the opening act is Sly and the Family Stone.  And we had Sammy Shore.  I got the--I'll show you the program.  Anyway, so we were performing and we finished a two-week stint in the showroom.  Tom Jones was coming in.  Well, we went back into the 700-seat showroom, and Tom Jones opened.  A big to do was going on, he was hot.  And Elvis was coming to open at the International, and he was there two weeks.  We had a four-week engagement.  Elvis, one of the nights he came over to see Tom Jones.  Man, it was like, you know, Elvis Presley is in the house, you know, and Tom Jones.  And they finished, Tom Jones finished his show.  They both came over to the cabaret, and they sat in a booth in the back.  They had security guards and all that business back there.  And before they sat down, they came back around through the back and came backstage and said hello to everybody.  Elvis had on a black jumpsuit with tassels on it, and a beautiful turquoise and silver belt, sort of a wrap-around Indian style thing.  He was, you know, he was looking good.  So, he and Tom Jones are back there.  We start talking and we're sitting in the dressing room, and they were shaking hands with everybody, The Mills Brothers and all of us.  And they said, "We're going and watch the show."  And they went out front and they sat in the back.  You couldn't see them because they were up on--it was a tier, it was three-tiered.
Speaker 1: A special section for them?
Speaker 2: Right.  And they were in the back.  And I asked them in front of everyone, I said, "Do you want me to introduce you?  Can I introduce you?"  And they said, "We don't care," you know.  So I introduced them, but after we had finished our last--we were in the middle of our last song.  And I introduced them.  And I told everybody, I said, "Now ladies, ladies, we'd like for you to be calm.  We called for the [American] Red Cross, and they're standing by."  (Laughter) You know, I said, "We have a couple of guys that are friends of ours that have dropped in to see us."  And we'd like to say hello to them, because we feel very honored to have them in the room."  And I said, "We have a gentleman that's appearing next door, who's headlining in the showroom, the great Tom Jones."
Story_ID: 239131
Speaker 1: --Pandemonium.  And when I said Elvis Presley was sitting there--shoot, man, the security guards had to come around the table and they had to, you know.  Anyway, after that they came backstage again.  And then Elvis, we got into a little spiritual singing, some gospel stuff, you know, just hanging out.  And I asked Elvis, I said, "That's a--man," I said "Where'd you get that belt, man?"  He said, "Somebody gave it to me, it's a gift."  I said, "Well, you're known for giving stuff away, you know.  Do you need it?"  He said, "Oh, no, I can't--."  He said, "This is a gift."  He said, "You want a belt, huh?"  He says, "I might have one I can find, and I'll give you one."  Now two years later, alright, this is after The Platters, okay.  This is late '68 [1968], sixty-something.  In '70 [1970] I left The Platters and whatever, and the whole thing ended at the showcase.  And I'm now working in [Las] Vegas [Nevada], and I'm at The Sahara [Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada] with Little Anthony.  And Joe Esposito, his road manager comes.  We see Joe standing outside the curtain going, "Hey, hey."  I said, "Oh, Elvis must be in town, Joe.  What's happening?"  He said, "Hey, I want to talk to you."  You know, I said, "Okay."  He came backstage and he says, "Elvis wants to invite you guys over to a party Hilton is having for him, Ann-Margret's opening.  And he wants to invite you guys over," you know.  I said, "Alright!"  And at the time I was married to a young lady from Baltimore [Maryland], and we went over.  And we had the whole top floor.  Now this was the transition from the International [Hotel; Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada] to the [Las Vegas] Hilton, and this was later.  This was like, let's see, Tom Jones--'68 [1968] or '69 [1969].  And '70 [1970] is when I was back there.  But anyway, Elvis had the whole top floor.  We go down the hall and you could hear the music and all the stuff down there.  "Come on, man."  We went down there, and there was Elvis Presley, Linda Thomas [sic. Linda Thompson], the girl he was going with at the time, Ann-Margret, Sonny West and his brother, a karate instructor, Ed Parker, Joe Esposito, and there was a couple other people.  And the backup singers were the St. James Sisters [sic. The Sweet Inspirations] that sang backup, three black girls singing backup, and some of the other musicians.  And he went, "Hey, how you doing?  Oh, man," you know, greetings all around.  And he introduced everybody and we sat down.  And he was sitting in the seat like this, and he said--we started talking about doo-wop, the old time singing and what have you, and gospel singing and rhythm and blues.  And he said, "Oh, yeah, I remember something."  He says, "Wait a minute."  He says "Joe," he said, "Get [HistoryMaker] Sonny [Turner] to stand up."  And I stood up.  And he says, "Now, Joe, stand on this side."  And he says, "Sonny West, stand on this side."  And he says, "Hold your hands out."  And I'm thinking, oh, they're going to do something weird, you know.  These guys are pranksters, you know.  And he said, "No, no, just close your eyes.  You got to close your eyes.  Put your hand over--."  We put our hands over--.  I said, "Oh, man."  I'm going--you know.  And the next thing I know he says, "This will just take a few minutes."  And he comes back, and I hear footsteps.  He walks up and puts this thing in my hand.  And I said, "What the hell is it?"  "Okay, open your eyes."  I open my eyes, and there's this belt--red, white and blue, with Thunderbirds on it.  He said, "This is the belt you asked me for."  And this is like--
Speaker 2: Years later.
Speaker 1: A couple of years later.  He remembered that.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: And I got the belt right on my mantel, right there over the fireplace.
Speaker 2: There seems to be a lot of, a lot of people back in the day would do stuff.  I heard of Wes Montgomery giving away guitars to the young guitar players.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, his thing was he enjoyed entertainers--entertainment and people in the entertainment field also.  But he was a, he was a real nice guy.  He was just easy-going.  And I think the whole persona, or the whole fact that he was bigger than he really realized, you know, I think it was a bit much for him, you know.  And I mean--him and Jesus, you know.  (Laughter) I mean, you know, he was huge.  And I think that--but he was a real nice person.  That's my recollection of Elvis, you know.
Story_ID: 239132
Speaker 1: So, your band has been going on strong since the '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  I've changed the name to Sonny Turner Show, and various things have happened, good things.  And the continuation of my relationship as being lead singer for The Platters has stood me in good stead.  That's something that I think will remain with me to the end of my days, an accomplishment, a dream come true that has really, like I said, stood me in good stead in this business all along.  Plus, my ability to perform onstage, you know, and make recordings.  I have recordings, my own company recording label.
Speaker 1: Are you still traveling with the group?
Speaker 2: I'm still traveling with the group extensively throughout Europe and Japan.  We haven't been back to South America lately, but Bermuda, the [Caribbean] Islands, doing cruises, you know.
Speaker 1: I notice that there's been a resurgence.  There's one person in particular, I can't think of his name.  You might know his name, he works for the PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] situation.  And he's been doing, bringing back all the doo-wop groups and doing musicals.  Have you all been involved with some of those musicals?
Speaker 2: Yes, as a matter of fact we recently did two television DVDs for LAR Productions [sic. LAR Enterprises], which we were on tour for, and just recently the earlier part of the year.  And then we're part of the doo-wop [The] Vocal Group Hall of Fame [Foundation].  And Herb Reed and I did a reunion, as well as Bill Pinkney and Charlie Thomas of The Drifters, and Ben E. King.  And they had like thirty known named performers on this particular DVD, which they're showing it now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it's on PBS--
Story_ID: 239133
Speaker 1: And we also have, I like to make mention of the Truth in Music Act [Truth in Music Bill] that we've asked [U.S.] Congress to enact for the sake of the performers who are well-known who have been robbed over the years by imposters using their names.  And in short, what it means, Truth in Music is a law that no performer can perform under the name of a said group unless there is one member or two members of that particular posing to be that group.
Speaker 2: Is that a big problem nowadays?
Speaker 1: A very huge problem.  Unscrupulous promoters have been forming numerous groups by The Platters, [The] Coasters, [The] Drifters, [The] Shirelles, [The] Marvelettes.
Speaker 2: The Temptations.
Speaker 1: The Temptations, you know, and we're all going through it.  And these later years that we are living in, our later years, we shouldn't have to deal with things of that kind to rob us of our legacy.  That's exactly what that is, it's robbery.  And plus, moreover it's defrauding the general public of their hard-earned money.  When they buy a ticket to see The Platters, you're seeing some people who have worked for Paul Robi or David Lynch or Zola Taylor, or some member of The Platters claiming to be The Platters on the music, and they're singing the songs and not giving the honest representation.  They're misrepresenting themselves, saying that they--you know, they leave with the thought or the fact that, "Oh, I've seen The Platters, or one of The Platters."
Speaker 2: So, how far is this legislation going now?  Where are you at with it?
Speaker 1: We have nine states.  No, no, we have more than nine; we have nineteen states now.  What we're trying to do is get Congress to pass it throughout the United States, and it will probably catch on in Europe and all around the different venues around the world.  But we have tried to get Congress to pass it, and the legislations, or the legislatures here in the State of Nevada was very upset over the fact that they weren't the first to act on it.  But they did act on it, and it's a law now in the State of Nevada.  So, the attorney general [Catherine Cortez Masto] is confronting these people that come here.  And lately we've had some people misrepresenting themselves here in this state.  And also in Missouri, there's a group calling themselves "The World Famous Platters," you know, and there's not a Platter on the stage.  You know, I don't know what they're world-famous for, but they're misleading the public.
Story_ID: 239134
Speaker 1: Where are most of the original Platters now?  Are they still alive?
Speaker 2: Unfortunately--fortunately for me, I'm still here of course.  And then Herb Reed, the founder, the bass singer, is still living.  And the rest of the members of The Platters have passed on.  Recently we lost Zola Taylor, the female vocalist, the earlier part of this year.  And Paul Robi's been gone a while, the baritone singer, and David Lynch, the second tenor.  Antonio Williams, Tony Williams, he's passed on.  Buck Ram, the manager of the original group has passed on.  And his former secretary, who's still carrying on the managerial part of Personality Productions, unfortunately she's aligned herself with some unscrupulous promoters who have misled her.  And they have multiple groups of Platters now, and like I said, that's what the law is for, Truth in Music [Bill].
Speaker 1: So you're a fighter now for the Truth in Music Act, and that's a very--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It seems like a great cause.
Speaker 2: I'm a staunch supporter (laughter).
Story_ID: 239135
Speaker 1: Also, are you remarried again now?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm married again to a beautiful lady from Tennessee who is in the clothing business.  Her name is Roxie, Roxie Franklin Turner.  And she's a foxy Roxie.  (Laughter) And she has joined myself in supporting my continued effort to keep my business going as a performer and entertainer.
Speaker 1: Let me get your opinion on some of the, the way that the music industry--you see a lot of young people today claiming to be talented.  Do you think the talent base, or the pool, is the same way that it's been, as it was in your time?  What do you think about the music industry today?
Speaker 2: There, there's a lot of talented people on this planet, okay.  Some are quality performers who are taught the business, and some haven't learned and they create their own genre, or their own personality.  I don't, I don't particularly care for some, for most of the rap music.  Some of it I like, you know, and some of it is instrumental in telling a story and talking to the young people.  Some of it is negative, misleading our young people.  And then some of it is--the DVDs they make are insulting.  And some of them--I say some of them--I don't want to generalize, you know, lump them all together, because there are very talented people out there who write and create.  One thing I like about the young industry and their music is that they're learning to conduct their own business, they have business sense.  They're recording their own records.  They have their own record company.  They're making the money and they're keeping most of it for themselves, you know, and then they re-invest it.  And they're learning business, show business, which I'm proud to see with the young folks, you know.  And there's a lot of great talent.  We lost one of my heroes, one of my--Luther Vandross, who was a shining example of great talent, you know.  And we still, you know, we still got Whitney [Houston] and we still got Mariah [Carey] and different people like that.  And it's a shame that we see so much of the talent wasted and the foolishness that they do--the stupidity that they do, and waste their lives.  You know, and the paparazzi is all over these people, young people like Britney Spears and those kids, and Lindsay Lohan and all of them.  They don't have somebody that loves them enough to help them not become stupid; you know, that's the behavior, stupid behavior.  And then if they have children, what's going to happen with their kids, you know?  That part of the business, I feel sorry for.  But most of it is generally good.  They got good, creative artists out there that are just--I mean we still got [HistoryMaker] Smokey [Robinson].  (Laughter).  You know, we still got some of the--[HistoryMaker] Dionne Warwick and some of the great performers that--you know, Barbara Streisand and, you know, we still got Tony Bennett, great performers.  We lost [Luciano] Pavarotti, you know, but we've got--I'm trying to think of the young man's name, he's blind.  He's one of the great tenor voices, gifted voices that we have.  We have a lot of, still a lot of the great performers are still around.  My look on the business is to savor all the quality that I see, and enjoy it and be a part of it.
Story_ID: 239136
Speaker 1: Let me ask you.  Why did you want to tell your story?
Speaker 2: Because the legacy that I wanted to-- posterity that I wanted, you know, that [HistoryMaker] Sonny Turner counted on the stage of music and in the world of musical history.  And I was lucky enough to be put in the history books, to become part of an iconic group that made history, you know.
Speaker 1: How do you feel, Mr. Turner, about the way you've lived your life?  And what's important to you right now?
Speaker 2: The continuation of producing quality, not only in my music, but as a human being.  I've learned a great deal about how to sing, how to perform, and most of all, how to be a good human being, a good person.  There is no perfection, of course.  I have my moments, you know, but I've learned a lot from what--you reach back and you get what your grandmother [Queenie Davis], your mother [Pearl Davis Turner], and your grandparents taught you.  And I think the best reward to me is to pass that on, you know, just to be able to--I think it's a super intelligent thing to be able to co-exist with your fellow human beings on a positive level in every way.
Story_ID: 239137
Speaker 1: For those that are going into the entertainment business, do you have any suggestions?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do.  Believe in what you're doing.  Stay true to it.  Don't give up.  You're going to run into a lot of performers, young performers, who are gifted.  You're going to run into unscrupulous people.  Learn to read contracts, and before you sign your name, learn what you're signing, you know.  And look for--like I said, just be true to yourself and protect what you have to offer, you know, as a performer.  Don't get into destructive things that will take you out of sync, out of step with your future.
Story_ID: 239138
Speaker 1: What are your aspirations for the African American, your hopes for the African American community in the future?
Speaker 2: To elevate to that--to the greatness of what we can be as a people, like every other ethnicity that I've seen.  They borrow from their history, and they develop it and they teach it to their children, and the children continue it.  It perpetuates a great ethnic group of people.  That's what we are.  We are a great people, just like any other race on this planet, you know.  And I hope to see that there's a diminishment in gangs, the gang mentality, the killing of one another, black-on-black murder, killing.  It's sad, and it's counterproductive in every way, you know.  And babies having babies, such things as that.  It's happening to every other race of people, but more so because I look at what we are developing into, you know.  And I just pray and hope that some of the old school lessons, you know, penetrate, you know, into our young people, in their minds.
Story_ID: 239139
Speaker 1: When you look back at your life, what stands out the most?
Speaker 2: That I made a success of my life and I've reached the pinnacle of success.   At one point I'm still looking to retain a certain status in show business which I can enjoy, a quality status that I can enjoy.  I'm proud of who I am, I'm proud of being who I am.  I'm proud to be from a race of people who are magnificent, you know, and I'm proud of other people, other ethnicities that I run into, people that talk to me about their cultures.  And it's just, it's great that I've learned so much in life.
Story_ID: 239140
Speaker 1: And how do you want to be remembered?  What do you want your legacy to be, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Sonny] Turner?
Speaker 2: He did it.  (Laughter) No, I want my legacy to be in my children and grandchildren carrying on a good life, and meeting the measure of what they dream of, you know, and counting for something positive.  You know, I want to be remembered as somebody that contributed in a positive manner, you know, to the world of music and as a person.
Story_ID: 239141
Speaker 1: And what message do you have for those children and grandchildren of the world, not just yours, but for the world?  What message do you have?
Speaker 2: I think that to be intelligent is to coexist on a positive level with your fellow human being, and produce.  There's no--I mean that's why I'm a "Trekkie," I love 'Star Trek.'  Because if we get, if we can reach that level of scientific knowledge and existence and accomplishments, and travel from one star to the next, I mean, you know, that is--you know, if we could reach that level, you know, and co-exist with one another, and just keep producing.  I think God has given us the brain, and all these talents, and all this wonderfulness, to keep creating and improving on what we create for the betterment of ourselves.
Speaker 1: Well, I want to thank you for your time.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: And for your legacy in music, for your personality, and all the light and love that you give out.

And in the red would be my youngest daughter, who is a police lieutenant in the LAPD.  And on the upper right-hand corner, from my sitting here, would be my youngest daughter.

And in the lower picture is my mom [Pearl Davis Turner], who is in the lower right-hand corner there.
Speaker 2: Okay, tell us about this one.

And that's little [HistoryMaker] Sonny Turner in the middle, and Carl would be on my left.  And that's Freddie [ph.], the oldest brother, on my right.  And we're standing out front of our apartment building in the parking lot taking a picture, and you can see how dapper we are (laughter).  That's on a Sunday, that's the way we went to Sunday school.
Speaker 2: "We three, 1953."
Speaker 1: Oh (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: And there we are, The Metrotones, 1957, at the Majestic Hotel [Cleveland, Ohio] in the Rose Room [Cocktail Lounge].  The guy at the microphone is called Boon, Bill Brent, our bass singer.  And that's Sonny Turner, and then the one next to me is Angelo [Jones], our baritone.  And that beautiful lady is Leuvenia [Eaton] Turner, whom I subsequently married.  And then there's Leonard Veal on the very end there, who was, who became the lead singer for the Hesitations.  That's The Metrotones, Cleveland, Ohio, back in the day.
Speaker 2: Okay, very good.  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: And there's Mom at a birthday party in Cleveland back in the day.  She's celebrating, and that's one pretty lady.  She's, that's--of course you can see where I got my good looks.  (Laughter) That's Pearl Turner, Pearl Queenie Davis Turner having a birthday.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: There's James Brown.  That was about three years ago in Detroit, Michigan at a place called Freedom Hill [Amphitheatre, Sterling Heights, Michigan].  We opened for James Brown.  That's Mr. James Brown, and standing next to him is Mr. Morris Williams, our bass singer.  That's James Brown saying "He's the man."  And I said he was the man, but he said I was the man.  (Laughter). Brother James, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: There's Rick James.  (Singing) "She's a very freaky girl."  (Laughter)  We were singing to his mother [Mabel Johnson] on her birthday, singing 'Happy Birthday' to his mother.  His mother was a big fan of Sonny Turner and The Platters.  And that's Rick James, he came to see me on a couple occasions.  And that's, that's when Rick James was in his heyday.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: There's Sonny Turner, smooth, dapper Dan, with one of his favorite female actresses and movie stars and singers, [HistoryMaker] Eartha Kitt.  And it was in Mexico City [Mexico] at the Nuevo Terraza Casino [Mexico City, Mexico].  And we were, she came to see us with a party and friends of hers.  She was appearing in town also at the Las Fuentes, which is the Fountain Nightclub.  And she came to see me, and was gracious enough to take a picture.  She knew I was in love with her, she knew it all the time (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: There is a, as you can see--way back, it's been scratched up.  I think my little boy [Jason Turner] did that.  He tried to write his name on my, on Daddy's gold record that was given to me by Musicor [Records] with the hit record, 'With This Ring.'
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That, gentlemen, is from Ramsgate Country Club in Greenville, South Carolina.  It's a membership certificate given to me by Pete Manus [ph.], Dr. Manus, and George Loomis [ph.].  Pete Manus is the president of the country club, and also George Loomis, 1973.  I'm the only black man ever given a membership to a country club in the south, in Greenville, South Carolina.  I made history there, and those people were excellent, very nice to Mr. Turner and his group.  And they made changes throughout the South from then on, because I ran the whole country club (laughter).
