Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you some questions about your family.  Do you know--what do you know about the origins of your family and, and where they came from?
Speaker 2: I really don't know too much about them.  My father [Ebenezer Bush, Sr.] lived to be about a hundred.  And his mother lived to be about a hundred.  She was a former slave I believe.  I was a small boy when she died.
Speaker 1: And when did your father die?
Speaker 2: He died about fifteen, twenty years ago, fifteen years ago I guess.  I'm not too sure, maybe twenty.
Speaker 1: Okay, maybe 1985 or so?
Speaker 2: Something like that, so, so-
Speaker 1: So, so he, he may have been born around 1885?
Speaker 2: Something like that.  I wasn't, I wasn't too sure.  He's way back there in the 8--I know it was 1800s I know.

Speaker 2: Well-
Speaker 1: His parents--both, both of his parents really.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--father--my grandparents, which was his mother and father, the, the--I was a small boy.  I didn't know that much about them 'cause they died when I was quite a young kid.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, did he talk about them much or talk about--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: [Clearing throat] Yes, he talked about them somewhat, but they lived around us when I was a small child, so I kind of got to know them a little bit.
Speaker 1: Did they, did they have any stories about the nineteenth century?  Any stories about the days when slavery was going on in the South, or any stories about any African traditions passed down through the family or?
Speaker 2: It seemed like my grandmother used to tell stories about--I think she was--she spoke French.  And she was taken from an island of Martinique--I believe it was something like that--captured and brought over here, 'cause she didn't--(unclear)--her English was very, very spasmodic.  And she told about the--you know, I was so young.  She told stories about the master and so forth, but not too much she talked about that.
Speaker 1: So you didn't--there's noth--it's nothing you really remember that she-
Speaker 2: Not too much I can remember, not-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --no, nothing earthshaking about.
Speaker 1: Anything about--on, on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: My mother [Gertrude Blackmore Bush] [clearing throat], [her] mother lived across the street from us.  And her father was, I think, was either a slave or almost slave.  And she lived--she, she [maternal grandmother] took care of us while my mother worked, so I knew my mother's mother very, very well.  But she wasn't, I don't think she was a slave really.
Speaker 1: Okay, was, was, was she born around Shreveport [Louisiana] too?
Speaker 2: She was born in Natchitoches, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: How can you--can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: N-A-T-C-H-I-T-O-C-H-E-S-
Speaker 1: Okay, Natchitoches [Louisiana], okay.
Speaker 2: --which is seventy miles from Shreveport [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On some plantation down there.  I think her father, I don't know if he owned the land or was in sharecropper with--I kind of slightly remember her father--no, that was, he died when I was such a small kid, I don't remember him too well.
Story_ID: 75064
Speaker 1: Okay, well can--please give us your father's name and spell it for us.

Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I had two sisters, Ruth Bush, the oldest one, and Eunice, Eunice Bush was the middle [sic, younger].  I'm the middle child; I'm between the two girls.  There were three of us.
Speaker 1: Can you spell your mother's name for us and-
Speaker 2: Gertrude, G-U-R-T--E-R-T-R-U-D-E, Gertrude.  Her maiden name was Blackmore, and then she probably married my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 75065
Speaker 1: Can, can you tell us what, what kind of person your father [Ebenezer Bush, Sr.] was, and, and what did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: My father was the most outstanding man I know, honest as the days are long.  I never knew anybody like him, truly was a Christian in his heart.  He, he was a farmer, and we raised vegetables as market farming.  We sold vegetables to the richest white people in Shreveport, Louisiana, such as Huey [P.] Long and people like that.  We had a truck we went out every day and peddled vegetables of the first order, of the finest quality.  That's what we did for a living.  And my mother did maid's work to help out with the sup--to sup--help with the income because stuff was so small amount bringing in at that time, and she did some work for a family.  She worked seven days week, seven dollars a week, a dollar a day.  And that's what's, what it was.
Speaker 1: Now did, did you all own your own place, or did you rent-
Speaker 2: No, he, he rented the place.  He didn't own the place.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, can you--do you remember any stories about your father you wanna share with us?
Speaker 2: Do I remember any story about my father?  I'd never--is he's just such a man's--I don't know too much--like what?  Give me an example of what you wanna know.
Speaker 1: Well, I mean it might be some story you, you remember about something he did for you or did for somebody else in the community or-
Speaker 2: Well, the only thing I can remember about him, he's always willing to help other people more than--he's a very down to earth man, was very, he was a very brilliant man when it comes to math.  For his age, he was very smart fellow.  And I can remember when people had problems, they'd always come to him.  And he might be able to figure the problem out, but he'd get up at midnight and work on it.
Speaker 1: Okay-
Speaker 2: And I also remember at midnight he always prayed, every midnight on Sunday morning and got up and prayed for his family.  I can remember as long as I lit--as long as I can ever remember he did that--for the success of his family.  Secondly, he always asked us to be help, kind to one another and help, be helpful to each; when one is down, help the other one.  He always, he prayed for that, that we'd be helpful to each other.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He, he, he was definitely a decent person.
Story_ID: 75066
Speaker 1: Now did you all attend, attend church?
Speaker 2: Intend what?
Speaker 1: Church.
Speaker 2: Yes, oh yes, attend church.
Speaker 1: Now what, what denomination?  What was the-
Speaker 2: Baptist-
Speaker 1: --name of the church?
Speaker 2: We were Baptist.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was the name of the church?
Speaker 2: St. Rest Baptist Church [Shreveport, Louisiana], where my mother [Gertrude Blackmore Bush] and father [Ebenezer Bush, Sr.] lived, went to church, and we, my sister, the youngest sister [Eunice Bush], and I went to another church called Oakland Baptist Church [Shreveport, Louisiana].  For some reason, we joined the church that's close to our home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they went to church a little farther away.  And we, we, I don't know, we just, we all were Baptist.  I don't know how that happened, but it just-
Speaker 1: It didn't make any difference to your parents?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't--as long as you're going.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Didn't make him any difference.
Speaker 1: Were your friends going to the other church?  Is that why you all went, or-
Speaker 2: I can't remember any--I don't know.  I guess we did have friends there.  But I guess we grew up kind of individ--he left it on your own.  He [Ebenezer Bush, Sr.] was very, a man of very--he left it up to you to more or less make some decisions.  And he was not a mean man, but he was strict but not mean.  So he left to make some decision on your own.  So we made decisions to on church--close church, and he didn't say anything so long as we're in church.
Speaker 1: Okay-
Speaker 2: I'd visit his church sometime and, and sometime he'd visit where we were.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we were all Baptist.
Speaker 1: Now when you were young, did you participate in church programs and-
Speaker 2: Yes, I participated in normal church programs and BY--the Young Men Christian association what you call BYPU [Baptist Young People's Union], Sunday school, I worked with that.
Speaker 1: Okay, now was your father engaged in civic activities when you were coming up in the neighborhood and in your community?  Did-
Speaker 2: Well, he didn't really have time to do anything (unclear)--during that time, he was so busy working.  But he did what he could and not too much.  Most of his work was in church work.  He was a, a deacon of the [St. Rest Baptist] Church [Shreveport, Louisiana], chairman of the trustee board and all that type of thing.  He's, he really stayed most of his time (unclear) with church.
Speaker 1: So he, he didn't get involved with the Masons or anything like that?
Speaker 2: At what?
Speaker 1: The Masons or the Elks [Lodge] or-
Speaker 2: At one time he was a Mason, but then he kind of got out of, kind of got away, because it got so much crookedness in it.  And he didn't believe in that, so he just didn't bother with it.
Speaker 1: Oh-
Speaker 2: He was a Mason at one time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 75067
Speaker 1: Now, tell us something about your mother [Gertrude Blackmore Bush]; you know, what kind of person was she, and what did she generally do?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was very kind and generous.  She would give us, she would give you the coat off her back, very kind person.  And oftentimes, people would be in trouble.  I don't know if you--well, you don't know anything about--anyway, people back during my day, whenever someone would get sick, they would sit with them.  They didn't want 'em to die by themselves, that old saying black people, "I don't them to die by themselves."  So my mother was an old--(unclear)--kind of made a committee of one to see that each person who dying to grab someone to go in the house, stay with them.  For some reason, that was one of the things they always did.  And she would see that if we had a lot of--my father raised so much stuff, like vegetables.  We would give it to people away.  During the Depression when they were starving, she would, we would, didn't--instead of letting it perish, we'd give it away to the community.  She's say, "Take this bushel of so-and-so to Ms. So-and-So and her children; take this over," stuff like that.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: So she was a very nice person, very--didn't have a lot of education, but she had a lot of common sense.  Yeah, she wanted for us that which she didn't have herself, which was an education.
Story_ID: 75068
Speaker 1: Okay, did your parents get a chance to go to school at all?
Speaker 2: Well, they went some, you know, I guess back there then.  My father [Ebenezer Bush, Sr.] probably went to ninth, tenth grade.  I guess my mother [Gertrude Blackmore Bush] probably gone less than that, but you know they had to work during those years.  They had to work; working was a key thing for black people at that time.
Speaker 1: Now did they have a story about how they met, that, that you remember?
Speaker 2: I don't remember too much about it.  I think they met some way.  See, my father was married twice.  His first wife passed away, 'cause he older than our mother.  And I have a half-brother in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And his mother died during childbirth.  And after years, my father met my mother I think in Shreveport [Louisiana] somewhere--I don't know exactly; I never did really get into it--and they met.  I think my mother was--my grandmoth--no, let me, let me see can I back up just a moment.  My mother's father was half--Indian almost, almost Indian; that's the reason why the name Blackmore; my grandmother was real dark.  So her husband, being an Indian or almost Indian, got in a fight when she [my mother] was a baby with some white fellow.  And he beat this white fellow at the fight, so he ran him away when she was a baby.  And she don't even remember her father 'cause they, they ran him off here.  I don't know if they killed him or what.  So then my grandmother was [clearing throat]--(unclear) married again, and she had my mother.  And she couldn't you know, couldn't do much so much, so she sent my mother up to stay with some kinry (ph) [sic, kin] in Shreveport [Louisiana].  And I think that's how my father and mother met.  They were staying with some my--her kinry [kin] up there at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I believe that's what she said.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's about all I know about it.
Story_ID: 75069
Speaker 1: Okay, I, I want you to reflect back on your days as a child, and give us some idea of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up in Shreveport [Louisiana].
Speaker 2: Sight, sound, and smell.  Well, I guess Shreveport [Louisiana] was just an old segregated city, a lot of old bad white people, you know, you knew your place, and it had good cooking, what few restaurants at that time.  They had more business there then than you have now in, even in Long Beach [California] and LA [Los Angeles, California], 'cause they had little cafe's and things had very nice food in-
Speaker 1: Was Shreveport [Louisiana] like a tourist attraction in those days?  Did a lot of people-
Speaker 2: It was just-
Speaker 1: --used to go there?
Speaker 2: No, it was just a-
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: --is, is all located on Red River.  And it used to have a port long years ago coming as a tributary to Mississippi [River], we used to unload boats there, in many years before my time, however.  And it was port they used to unload steamships there, and that's the reason why they call the port Shreveport [Louisiana].  But it was a decent--you know, it's (unclear) a place that--I didn't really boil over it too much because my family was so loving.  I didn't have time to think about how (unclear) place was 'cause I had a lot of love at home.  My father [Ebenezer Bush, Sr.] always believed in us, and I believe in myself, and he told us to believe in each other.  And I didn't know that I was poor, 'cause we had plenty of food; he always made a--he didn't have money, but he provided more than an adequate living for us so far as food is concerned.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause you grew up during the Depression-
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --what they call the Great Depression.
Speaker 2: Right.  I was a little boy (unclear) Depression, that's right.  It was tough.  So-
Speaker 1: Very little cash, but-
Speaker 2: Had no cash, but a lot of food-
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: --you had a lot food and no money.  We'd take a load, truckload of stuff out, and if we got thirty dollars for it, you know, big old truckload of just stuff, cantaloupes we'd sold for ten cents, big (unclear) and large ones, sweeter than anything you ever seen around here, take two for a nickel or two for a dime, all that fruit, just, just whatever we could get out of it.  They did the best they could.
Story_ID: 75070
Speaker 1: Okay, well, what, what are some of the other sights and sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: What are some of the other sights and sounds and smells in growing up around here [Shreveport, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: I really don't know.  (Unclear)--had no sights and sounds.  I don't know about that.  We don't-
Speaker 1: And what did it look like?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: What did it look like?  What did your community look, look like?
Speaker 2: Well, it was ghetto, typical ghetto.  We had a fairly decent house and others were all shacks and shanties and tolled (ph.) houses up on stilts and stuff like that.  We had a, we had one of the better houses in my community.
Speaker 1: Was it brick or (unclear)-
Speaker 2: It's, it was just wood frame; it's on stilts, built on, you know, houses were built up off the ground.
Speaker 1: See, people don't know that, 'cause I, I've-
Speaker 2: So-
Speaker 1: --never seen that really, so you have to-
Speaker 2: You never seen (laugher)-
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're explaining it.  You're explaining something unique because I've never, I've never seen it.
Speaker 2: The houses were all built up high up off the ground for some reason.  I don't know why.  We didn't know what that was--
Speaker 1: Maybe you had a flood.  You think it's-
Speaker 2: I wasn't in a flood because we'd lived on Stony Hill [Shreveport, Louisiana], and it was hilly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: People used to build their houses up higher.  I don't know why they did it, but they did.  And it's called, you know, they had a (unclear) called a shotgun.  You could stick a shotgun straight through the house--(unclear)--call a shotgun 'cause it shoots right through things, same thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, the door, back door open in--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--(laughter)--(unclear)--just go-
Speaker 1: --the front, and you look around--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: --straight through the front.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Course we had a double house, but most people had shotgun housing, just go straight through.  We had lumbering houses, tenements; they all had little houses roadhouses; they all were shotgun.  Then it'd have bath facilities between two houses; every two houses had a bathroom between them and it would have a toilet and so forth.  The inside plumbing, when they finally got it, they put it between the two houses, had one--owner would name a house or a group of houses called his, his settlement or his--(unclear)--Darryl (ph.) brothers had a group of houses they owned, you know, kind of shotgun houses all together there.
Speaker 1: So that--it actually made one bathroom for every two houses, huh?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I didn't, I didn't realize that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it was joined together, two little shotgun houses.  And in the middle they put a bathroom, each two houses they put it so they wouldn't have to make a bathroom for two houses.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: That's when they finally brought the toilet inside from outside.  They used to have, you know, at one time, when I was a little boy they had cesspool toilet, outdoor toilets.
Speaker 1: Well, did they have any indoor toilets by the time you were-
Speaker 2: Yes, oh yes-
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: --we got the toilet when I didn't do--that didn't last too long.  They finally got sewer in and put, put them.
Story_ID: 75071
Speaker 1: Okay, well, what kind of a little boy were you?  I mean what did you, what did you like to do?  And did you, were you obedient, or were you-
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: Obedient.
Speaker 2: Yes, I was very obedient, very inquisitive, searching mind, didn't like to fight a lot.  I always liked to reason with you.  I always believed if you--I don't--I didn't believe in violence.  I believed if, if we got into a confrontation, I think we ought to be able to talk it over.  So I became a mediator of this community, so everybody'll look to always try to settle--get 'em to settle it.  They look to me to do the settling.  So I did not believe in a lot of violence.
Speaker 1: Why do you suppose that's true?  'Cause most people's reaction to violence is to hit somebody back or to, to, you know-
Speaker 2: I don't--I guess because my father [Ebenezer Bush, Sr.], I guess.  He was kind of a meat man, and because my name is Ebenezer I guess, which is a Biblical name, it means the "stone of help", 47 Chapter, 12th verse.  I guess I'm an Ebenezer, I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I never did, never did believe in violence.  I don't say don't get angry.  "He who lives to run away, who live--who lives to run away will live to fight another day."
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Remember that.  I didn't believe in any violence.  At that time, they didn't have guns, like they had Texas Jack's or long knives.  They just stick a knife in you, kill you, say with a knife.  So I didn't go for that type of thing.  If I saw trouble coming, I always went the other way.
Speaker 1: Now did you like to read when you were a little boy?
Speaker 2: Yes, I liked, I liked, liked to read and I liked to stay with--I was very inquisitive, reading, and I liked to look at things and talk to people who had more that--with, with minds.  I just would listen to people, observe people and stuff like that.
Story_ID: 75072
Speaker 1: Who were some of the people in the neighborhood or at school that inspired you?  Can you remem--remember any mentors or role models that you looked up to?  It could have been-
Speaker 2: Well, in-
Speaker 1: --your father [Ebenezer Bush, Sr.] too.  You know, I know-
Speaker 2: Well, in high school I went to, of course, a high school called Central Colored High School [Shreveport, Louisiana].  Let me go back a little further.  I don't know what it is, honesty will always work, come through, shine through.  Somehow, my father used to trust me with his money, as a little boy.  I'd always been trustworthy.  So I would take the money and pay off his hands and you know, he did--at that time, they paid over silver dollars.  He had a lot of people working for him, and he said "Brother"--they called me Brother--he had a list of names and give me the sack and go up, go pay your people.  I did that as a youngster.  So in high school, I--let me see am I getting ahead of myself.  Let me (unclear)--community.  I'm trying to see if I ought to keep this organization here.  So in high school, after I got elementary school, I wanted to be a dentist.  I always liked medicine, always like some science, has always been my role in life.  I always enjoyed science.  Some people would encourage you, and others wouldn't.  That's typical of people.  Some would tell you, you know, "You can make it;" others just tell you, you, you, you know, "Why you wanna be this," and I wouldn't have talked to you anymore.  If you didn't encourage me, I did, I didn't even, I didn't say anything to move you.  I was through with you.  I (unclear) turn you off, 'cause I know where I wanted to go.  I didn't know how I was gon' get there, but I know I wanted to--where I wanted to go.  So in high school [Central Colored High School, Louisiana], I met several teachers, one named Ms. White, W-H-I-T-E, taught bookkeeping, and I was one of her favorite students for some reason.  I don't know why.  She found out I was honest.  Honesty will shine through, I don't how.  And she used to sent me to--send me to town with her checks to be pay her bills.  I lived across town.  See, even though the South was segregated, people lived all over town.  One would stay on one side, white people this--we all, we all was cross town, all, we'd all live in different sections.  So I'd have to cross the town to go to my home and have to pass through town to pay her bills.  They were (unclear) six all the month, then she'd me her check, sign it, I'd put it in the bank, pay her bills or bring back the book back next day.  Then the word went around to all the teachers on the faculty that Bush is honest.  So I became the official courier for the school.  They want something done they sent for me, and at, at Shreveport, Louisiana, at the Central [Colored] High School that's what I did.  So, I knew where I wanted to go.  Ms. White was very inspiring, but she's very demanding.  She, she, she de--she demanded you to get your work.  And I left there and I, I went to Tuskegee [University, Alabama].  You want me to go on, on to Tuskegee [University] now, or you wanna talk about Shreveport [Louisiana] long?
Story_ID: 75073
Speaker 1: You just, just backtrack a little bit to high school.  I mean what, what kind of activities did you engage in high school?  Did you all have a football team or--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Well, I did not play football or sports or anything like that.  I was (unclear).  When I wasn't busy in, in high school, I had to work on the farms.  I stayed busy with my daddy [Ebenezer Bush, Sr.], kept me busy.  As I told you, he had farm, and that we had raise cotton, and we raised--our main source of income was--I'd say my--he kept me busy when I wasn't in school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I stayed busy on the farm, so I didn't have a lot of school--after school activities.
Speaker 1: Did you have any kind of social life with the opposite sex or anything or-
Speaker 2: What now?
Speaker 1: Did you, did you go to dances and that sort of thing and?
Speaker 2: Now too much.  My father was so Christian, like he didn't believe in dancing, so I never did really, we did never did dance really.  He just didn't believe in it, and I was just, never did force it.
Speaker 1: Did you all have a radio when you were-
Speaker 2: We had a radio, yes, we had a radio.  We listened to Joe Louis fights and all that.  We had all that stuff, yeah, that too.  Everybody come to my porch and listen to Joe Louis, 'cause (unclear)--looks to my porch when Joe Louis was fighting back then during them days.  I was (unclear) radio programs way back then.  We had that, yes.
Speaker 1: Now that was a big event in those days, wasn't it-
Speaker 2: Big event.
Speaker 1: --when Joe Louis had a fight.
Speaker 2: Big event.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Everybody's porch--standing on my porch and ground a radio and listen to Joe Louis hit "1-2-3" and all that stuff--yeah.
Story_ID: 75074
Speaker 1: Now, what kind of stories did you hear around the community?  I mean did they talk about like famous black people in, in the country then, other than Joe Louis?  Did you know, have any sense of black people doing great things in other-
Speaker 2: (Unclear)-
Speaker 1: --parts of the-
Speaker 2: You mean what kind of black people did they talk about when I was a child?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm saying did, did they talk about black heroes or black people that, that were, that made great accomplishments or that--did they, meaning was that, was it that kind of discussion going on among--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Yes, they always--and black, we always had black history.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Booker T. Washington, George Washington Carver, Toussaint L'Ouverture, I mean (unclear) Penn, Frederick Douglass and all that stuff, when I was in high school, when I was in school; talked about that in elementary school, high school, all the way through.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But Dr. [George Washington] Carver was the main one because he was what?  Still living.  The rest of them were dead.  So he was a really a, a key 'cause here, this man was doing all this stuff with the peanuts at Tuskegee [University, Alabama].  And he was alive like me and you, during my day.  So I could re--we could relate with that more than you've got somebody, a Booker T. [Washington] or something like that.  Frederick Douglass I think was still living.  But Amours (ph.) people who were back there were dead.
Story_ID: 75075
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, well, yeah, let's talk about Tuskegee [University, Alabama] then, then.  I, I think I've kind of exhausted high school [Central Colored High School, Shreveport, Louisiana] I guess.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: I, I guess we've kind of exhausted high school, perhaps, but what--at the time of high school graduation, did you know what you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: Yes, I knew where I wanted to go.  I wanted to go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you know-
Speaker 2: And there were--I didn't know exactly at the time where I wanted to go.  I know just where I wanted to go.  There were three of us to go to college at the same time during Depression days, and that was--let me back up just a little bit on that.  In Shreveport [Louisiana], in high school I carried the papers afternoon paper called Shreveport Journal.  And at the end of my route, route, I would stop at a man's store who was very successful, named Est--they called him Ed Hudson.  And I used to spend my time talking to him.  See, I always--a lot of my time was spent listening to people, talking to 'em, how they got to be successful.  I always wanted to know what made you tick.
Speaker 1: Was this a black man or?
Speaker 2: This is a black man.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Black-white man.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--yeah, he's light skinned, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Louisiana got two societies, you know that.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: The mulattoes and the blacks, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he was unusual in that he was kind, and he was very successful.  So at the end of my route I stopped at his store.  I knew where I wanted to go and didn't know how I was gonna get there.  So I saw Mr. Hudson always had the best--he had the best store in that community.  Other business would start up and it'd soon be out of business, but his store kept going on and on.  As a little boy I noticed it kept going.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we have to stop here and change tape, that's all.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We'll, we'll pick this up.
Story_ID: 75076
Speaker 1: --I'd stop at, I'd stop at the, I would stop at Mr. [Ed] Hudson's store every evening at the end of my [paper] route, route.  And I began to wonder why this man was so successful and others wasn't.  He had nephews around about my age that he didn't allow in the store because they always pilferage and stealing and going on; he couldn't trust 'em.  So he sold me about their same age, and I was asking such penetrating questions, it must have been kind of--something about me was unusual I guess.  So I asked him one day, I said "Mr. Hudson, I'd like to ask you a question.  What is the formula for your success?"  So he said to me "there are reason why you be--there a reason for being successful," had a very small store, what, what was almost about the size of this room, a little longer, and was full of everything you wanted.  "First off, a little person come to my store and ask for something more than twice--I will keep it on a book ordered, because you cannot sell the shelves.  You must have something on the shelves to sell, number one.  Number two, always--if people come to you and after they've trade for you a while, and ask you for credit--and people who had to have credit back there then, they spent a little money.  Get hard--to look--(unclear) you see if they want extended some credit.  If a person comes in and want credit, and you tell 'em I'm--now I'm how much she want?  For ten dollars you can let 'em have whatever they want at that time you gonna let 'em have, and you can to enumerating stuff you have on, in, on hand, say I got two type of flour: I got my Gold Medal, and I got this, and I got that.  I want the best.  And every time you say something to him, he tells you he wants the best."  He said well, that patient won't-"that, person probably won't pay you.  Because anybody who wants credit gon' check what they, they spend, that's number two.  Number three, by always save some money, don't care how infinitesimal it is, was a dime, learn to save part of what you make.  And you get so used to saving, even though you think you can't save it, but when you go start to putting it in the bank and you can't wait till the next time to get your bank book to see how it's growing a little at a time, it becomes a habit.  Make sure you save something.  Number four, always buy some property, land, because there's only so much of it.  Buy some rent houses, and that'll be working when you sleep.  You'll have something working for you.  And you just keep those things going."  He, he--that's the advice he, some of the advice he gave me when I was a boy.
Speaker 2: Sounds like good advice.
Speaker 1: Very, very good advice, not only for the, it's good right now, today.  And I remember that from that on to this one.  My father had somewhat the same thing, but I mean coming from somebody else, you know, you--and he was very successful.  It made a difference.  That's the type of life I lived.  I always run, run around with people who were successful, and I wanna--I always found--wanted to know what made them tick.  Why are you successful and others not?  Why are the other people not suc--you suc--they are not successful?  That's what my life's all about.
Story_ID: 75077
Speaker 1: Now, back to college, I know my father [Ebenezer Bush, Sr.] wanted to send all of it for college, and he couldn't do it because he had no money.  I applied to North Carolina A and T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical University]; I was accepted there.  I was accepted at Southern [University, Louisiana]; I was at Wiley [College, Texas] or Bishop [College, Texas] wanted to, and where I applied, I was accepted.  But I wasn't settled.  I didn't seem to get the feeling until I got to Tuskegee [University, Alabama].  I applied at Tuskegee [University], and then not only was Dr. [George Washington] Carver, but then it came to me how the picture fitted, had to mosaic together, in that Tuskegee [University], said "come on to me, all you poor, and I'll help you."  By that, I mean they gave what is known as a five-year plan.  You could work five years and get your education more or less free.  And I said "this is what I want."  I've found the answer to my prayers, and I left home.  I, I carried the papers, and saved my money, and left home and went to Tuskegee [University].  I that time you had to ride a train and the ticket was long as--I don't know--fifteen, twenty inches long to ride from there, Shreveport [Louisiana], to Mississippi, 'cause you had to change two or three trains and they're segregated trains, as you know, and finally got there.  And I could see my mother standing at the station-"I want you to be a good boy."  I told her, I promised I would be good, 'cause I'd never been away for no more than twelve--more than seventy miles away from home, which was a hometown, Natchitoches [Louisiana].  That's as far as I'd ever been all of my life away from my mother and father, at that time.  And going to Tuskegee [University] was like going into a new era.  Tuskegee [University] was a school.  It was the green with the old green tiger [sic], old, old, or the Crimson Tiger was really something at that time.  It was a place to go.  So I arrive at Tuskegee [University] and got my assignment, which was you had to work eight hours a day and went to school at night.  They paid a dollar twenty cent a day, which ran about fifteen cents an hour, and got your assignment.  I got my room in one of the (unclear).  Tuskegee [University] has four (unclear), first, second third (unclear), and I got--no, let me for--let me back up just a moment.  When I first got on the campus of Tuskegee [University], and I also heard people say long years ago when I was a little boy, "if I could just rub my head on a college wall."  That's what used the old black people used to say, 'if I just could rub my head on a--you never heard that before?
Speaker 2: I've never heard it before.  (Unclear)--only rub my head on a college way.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) If I just do--if I could just rub my head on a college wall (laughter).  Yeah, that used to be a saying black--among the old black people, you know, pre-slave I guess--post-slave.  And I said "Lord, I've made it to Tuskegee [University], and now I'm gon' rub my head on this wall."  And Dr. [George Washington] Carver was living.  That's the next thing I wanted see, him.
Story_ID: 75078
Speaker 1: But anyway, back--I got my assignment and went to my room and got my job.  But it's always something to, when you think you got it made, it's something to upset your life.  I got my assignment, got my classes.  I was doing well, but it's always something to stop you in life, remember that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: There's always an alligator out there to get you.  And when I got my assignment, I was put in two in a room.  And one fellow was in there, and he coughed all night long.  I worked all day and went to school at night.  My class sometimes didn't get out at 10:00, which was the laboratory class, and I didn't get to bed 'til about eleven [11:00], had to be up the next morning at five [5:00] for physical fitness or ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].  And I was tired, and I'd wake up, I'd look up and the other guy was coughing and spitting up blood.  And oh, I was just--so I didn't know.  I, I, I just, I just couldn't half sleep.  He was coughing and barking and going on, and so he went to the hospital.  And when he went to the hospital, they found out he had tuberculosis.  Then in my mind, "I got what?"  Tuberculosis in the mind, that's the worse sickness you can have of the mental sickness.  My aunt had died with tuberculosis when I was a little boy.  And we wouldn't--they wouldn't let us go close to her, 'cause TB [tuberculosis] was one of the famous killers of black people during that era.
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: So I got sick.  They went, they put me in the hospital, and I couldn't be quiet.  I wrote my mother, and my mother, I loved my mother so much.  She was, she sent me baking soda, she sent me bromo--everything she could think of, scrapped what little money she could and boxed it up.  She wrote to dean of men and everything.  They was trying to quiet me down.  And that just would not do, except I had to go back and reorient myself, go back home.  And they didn't have hardly any money to get me there, you know, hardly get me back.  But I had to just change directions, because I just couldn't make it the way I was going.  I was just sick, you know, just mentally young; I was real young then, and just didn't see my way clear.  So finally, they scraped up what little they had and got me back home, and I left.  I stayed out of school a quarter; I went back home to Shreveport [Louisiana] to my community; and that's the best thing ever happened for me.  It toughened me.  When those people got through talking about me, after I went to the doctor and found out I was all right, and they got started eating on me day and night--I know we ain't, I don't whether he's going to Tuskegee [University] for.   I know you didn't have no money.  Why are you going down?  They way down in Tusk-Tuskegee [University] (laughter)-- and there was a whole talk, you know, a little community.  And I said "Lord, I if I can ever leave this place again, it'll be a blue moon in Texas 'fore I come back here again, if I can ever get back to Tuskegee [University]."  So my father then was saying "I don't have money enough to get you back.  I don't know--I, I don't have nothing.  I'm gonna try to get you back."  I said "just get me back, please."  So finally he got strapped--scrapped up enough money.  He had sold a hog or something to get me back to Tuskegee [University].
Story_ID: 75079
Speaker 1: But! There's always something to get you when you get back.  It's that alligator waiting on you.  And when I got back to Tuskegee [University], this man in charge of jobs was named Alonzo--should I call his name?  I better not call his name--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Sure, why not?  He's-
Speaker 1: Well, well, you know.  Anyway, he says to me, "You can't get your job back.  You, you missed your chance.  You've got to pay."  There was no way in the world I could have paid.  And there I was stuck between a rock and a hard place.  And I said "I don't know what I'm gon' do."  I went to the Lincoln Gates of Tuskegee [University] and looked out those gates.  It was too far to go.  I'd never worked anywhere else in my life, and here I was away from home and I can't get back in school, no job.  I was faced with a crisis.  But the Lord lifted me.  And the kids was bringing me food from the dining hall to keep me from starving to death.  I went back to Mr. Davis, said "Mr. Davis, what can I do?"  He said, "Well, you have to have a note saying you had to go home."  So I went to the hospital.  They put me in the hospital two or three days.  I carried a note back to Mr. Davis saying I had been hospitalized.  And when I handed him the note, he says to me "That won't do, that won't do.  You've got to have a note saying that you were sick enough to go home, otherwise you can't get back in school."  And I said "Lord, what am doing?"  And that's when faith and praying come into being.  I walked the campus in the morning.  I would see Dr. [George Washington] Carver early in the morning.  I'd say "Good morning, doctor," "Good morning, son."  I'd crisscross that campus--what am I gonna do?  I have no money, and not gonna leave yet.  I'm not going back to Shreveport [Louisiana] 'cause nothin's there, so I said I got to get back in school.  And I went to Booker T. Washington Monument--If you've been on the campus of Tuskegee [University], now this is some prarum--prayer for you, some of this, however--and looked at that monument of Booker T. Washington.  There's a base around that monument, and he's lifting the veil of ignorance from, from a slave and a plow.  And I said to him, "Mr. [Booker T.] Washington, I'm in trouble."  And I saw Booker T. [Washington]'s statue light up, and the blood starts running in his veins and in his arms and in his mouth, and finally he quivered, "Let your bucket down where you are."  And I went back to the hospital the next day, and I was crying.  And the secretary came out and went back to the medical director and starts, (unclear)--(unclear)--says "a man out there, student out there crying."  He said, "bring him in."  So I--he said, "what's wrong with you, son?"  I said, "I can't get back in school."  He said, "what can I do for you?"  I told him.  "Bring my secretary over here, and write anything he says.  I'll sign it."  So I told him and he wrote the note for me.  And I took it back to Mr. Davis.  He turned as red as a beet, 'cause he was a light skinned black person.  He said "you got me, but I'm gon' give you the worse job I can find, and you'd better make it."
Speaker 2: Why do you think he was so tough on you?
Speaker 1: I don't know why he was--just sometimes it made me a ca--it built my character though.  Even though he was tough on me, I hadn't done any--'cause I was a good worker.  I'd work, I'd work as much as two men really.  It's just sometimes in life you have something against you that makes you stand up.  I don't know why people hate you, why people hate anybody, but he just, so he built my character.  And I told him, I said, "Mr. Davis, in my heart"--I didn't tell him this--I don't care what you do, I'm gonna make it.  So he put me on the grounds, and everybody laughing during the springtime out there on, you know, sealing manure and stuff.  But anyway, I made it from that point on.  And from that time on at Tuskegee [University] I didn't have no more problem.  I went through from there on.  I held jobs all over the campus, and everyone always looked what someone from Shreveport, Louisiana, 'cause they're the workin'est, poorest working student to ever hit that campus.  I can't, I don't have time to tell you all the things about Tuskegee [University].  I'll tell you one or two stories that I could think of then enough of that.
Story_ID: 75080
Speaker 1: I have a degree in agriculture.  I knew I wanted to be a dentist, but I didn't know how I was gon' get there.  So, but I knew if I took agriculture it'll be easy for me because I was a farmer already, and you'd only need two courses more to be, be, to get your pre-med, 'cause I got everything else.  And I said I'll take agriculture, get a job, and go to dental school.  So I worked on it.  Now back to some of my work on the campus.  I worked all over the campus.  I worked the institute supply, where I was in charge more or less.  See, Tuskegee [University]'s a very, very unique place.  The students ran the school.  Whatever they put you in charge of, you was in charge of it.  They allowed you to give you full breadth of life experiences in running things.  Once, once you are--and once they found you're honest and trustworthy, you just had the ropes, you just, you just ran the thing.  I worked at the institute supply; I worked at the paint shop; I worked in maintenance; I used to char--be in charge of cleaning of floors in the dining hall, library, for our science building.  I left there and I went to dining hall, where I used to work 34 students at my command, under my (unclear).  I had all the--I had the power to hire and fire you, but I didn't fire a student.  I kept students who didn't get their meal tickets in time.  I had power to sign your ticket and let you go through the line.  To keep you from starving to death, I did that many times.  And one student I kept in school a whole year.  Now I'm, I'm not telling you all of Tuskegee [University], 'cause I can't tell you everything about Tuskegee [University].  But anyway, this particular student, I had--the thing was so large, and I was an officer day.  I was an ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] officer day, and sometimes I'd have to be doing duties on the campus with my--as an officer day you had to walk around.  You know, it's a kind of ceremony type thing.  And we had thirty-four students, so I had to have some assistant.  I had one named White and one named Knight.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And White came to me said--a very good student, brilliant student--said "Bush, I'm gon' have to leave school because I don't have any money.  My mother can't keep me any longer."  He lived in Atlanta, Georgia.  I said room and board was twenty dollars a month.  I said "how much can she send you?"  He said might-"she might can send me ten dollars, and maybe she can't send me nothing."  I went home that night in my dormitory room, and I, I rolled all night long like Jacob wrestled with the angel.  I wrestled with it all night.  I said "what can I do to help this student stay in school?  He has no money.  What can I do as an individual to help this student?"  And I wrestled and wrestled.  So I couldn't wait to get back the next day to see my immediate supervisor, which is George H. Howell.  And I said, "Mr. Howell, we have a problem.  I have a problem."  He said "what is it, Bush?"  One of our best students will have to leave school because he doesn't have any money.  He said to me, he said "Bush, you just work it out, and anything you work out, I will sign it 'cause I know you're gonna do the thing that's right."  So I went to White and said "White, if your mother don't send you anything, I'm gon' give you thirty [dollars], where that won't make--whatever she doesn't send you will make up the difference."  So I kept him in school a whole year, helped that kid stay in school.  Now, do you want me to talk about Tuskegee [University] then and then go on when I was in the [U.S.] Army and all that stuff, 'cause there's, there's another part of that story.
Speaker 2: Yeah--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: But I don't, I don't guess better--do you wanna finish at Tuskegee [University], right?  I gotta wipe my nose on my finger.  I guess I shouldn't be doing that.  But anyway-
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: So, that's one of the stories.  And White, there's another end to White's story in the [U.S.] Army, which I'll talk about in a few-
Speaker 2: When we get to the [U.S.] Army, or we can just-
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, when I--back, back at Tuskegee [University].
Story_ID: 75081
Speaker 1: Well, what about Dr. [George Washington] Carver?  Now, I don't think you talked about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --him.
Speaker 2: Okay, Dr. Carver, that's a good story.  And I guess we can end Tuskegee [University] with that, I guess.  I was a regular student at Tuskegee on the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps], and I would have been an officer, but I did not take--accept my commission because I wanted to, I was just, it just wasn't, wasn't--I was disillusioned.  I didn't, you know, fight--the [U.S.] Army means fighting.  And I told you I didn't like to fight, so I wanted peace.
Speaker 1: Were you, did you consider yourself very patriotic in those days?  Did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was not--I felt myself patriotic and all that other stuff.  I didn't wanna die.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause the infan- we were in the infantry.  That meant we had to lead men in battle, and I went on to be in the medics.  I was a medical officer.  I didn't wanna nothing to do with fighting.  You know, I could, I was a sharp shooter and all that stuff, but I didn't wanna go into it.  I just want--didn't want--so anyway, I turned my commission down and took a job.  But anyway, before I left Tuskegee, I had seen Dr. Carver up and down the campus.  He died in the '40s [1940s].  I finished in '43 [1943].  And all, every (unclear) some student working for him.  Dr. Carver had a guy, fellow, man working for him named Moore.  So I looked at Moore.  I said, "Moore, I'd like to talk to Dr. Carver.  You think it'd be possible for me to talk to him before I leave here?"  He said, "Yes, I'll talk to him and ask him, and I'll let you know."  So the answer came back in the affirmative.  "Dr. Carver will see you in his museum on Saturday at such and such a time, he'll see you."  So Ebenezer means the stone of help.  I asked twelve other guys to go with me.  I didn't wanna have him all by myself, so I asked all my friends, "Do you--I have an appointment with Dr. Carver.  Do you wanna go?"  So twelve of us, which with me I made thirteen, met in his museum on that morning, twelve, thirteen of us.  And I got as close to him as you--I'm talking to you, looked right in his eyes.  And he was so glad to see us, very brilliant.  And he talked about all thing--how glad he was for--we thought of him enough to come see him, things like that.  And we went on a lot of stuff.  But there are four things he left me with I can remember of the zillion things he said; number one, always be a--always have unyielding faith in God, the maker and creator of everything; number two, be a student as long as you live because the world about you changes; number three, don't--always be trustworthy of people who trust you, don't betray their trust; four, don't let hate destroy you, care how much people hate you, you don't hate them.  He said, "With these four things, young men," he bidded us as he told us goodbye, "these things will carry you through life."  So he questioned us that day and gave us a--he looked out the window of his museum, and he said, "You see those magnolia that are falling on the ground there?  I challenge you fellows to go and see what you can do with them, 'cause God didn't make--whatever God made there's a use for it.  So go and see what you can do with it."  He was a very nice fellow to talk with.  He was very kind and gentle.  He spent a lot of time with us.  That's my experience with him.
Story_ID: 75082
Speaker 1: Now anything else about Tuskegee [University] you wanna know about, I should discuss?
Speaker 2: Well, you were there in, in the '40's [1940s]-
Speaker 1: Yes, in the '40's [1940s].
Speaker 2: The early '40's [1940s], right?
Speaker 1: I was there in the early '40's [1940s] [1938-1943].
Speaker 2: Were you, were you there when they had a Tuskegee-
Speaker 1: Airmen?
Speaker 2: No--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: Tuskegee what?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Tuskegee Field and the, the airfield and-
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --(unclear)--and the-
Speaker 1: I wrote my theme on Tuskegee Airmen at the airfield.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: "Hill bowled over at Valley Field and a (unclear)--channel to meet the needs of mankind."  And they'll begin to, begin the beginning of the Tuskegee Airmen, Tuskegee Air Force.
Speaker 2: And they call that Moton Field, right?
Speaker 1: The Moton Field was first, as a training field, and Tuskegee [Airfield] was built a little farther out there.  That was all of 'em, and I was there when all that land first started out.  I was there when the first--'cause I was running the dining hall, so the, the cadets ate in my dining hall.  They had little--the teachers had a little space in the dining hall, which you call Tompkins Hall.  I used to have to prepare food for them as they marched in.  The first class would be old Davis and all of them.  Anyway, the whole thing was just supposed to have been a myth on the Walter White.  You remember what I just said--(unclear) told you about that, right?
Speaker 2: No, tell us, tell, tell us-
Speaker 1: And it was to--people, 'cause people were beginning to talk about they didn't wanna fly.  And Roosevelt-Vice [sic] President Roosevelt kind of got, you know, tired of it, just hearing this noise.  And I think simps--then sent us someone who was secretary or somebody.  I don't know who he was--said black people can't fly, and there ain't nothing to 'em; they, they too scared, and they can't hold an airplane; they can't fly.  So they kept--brought it whites who kept jawboning and so forth and it's--then quiet them down of priding us down, they put this place at Tuskegee [University].  And that's how the Tuskegee thing came into being.  And this had made first to Moton Field.  They had a training field at the Moton [Field].  Then they had the regular airbase beyond a little farther.  And they gave 'em some P-40s, which was the worst type of plane you could fly, 'cause that thing is top-heavy.  If you don't know what you're doing, you, you--one guy, Kennedy, went to a hole, a little hole about large as this room.  He went down that hole.  'Cause once you dive down, if they pull it out right, you, you down that hole.  You (unclear) go up--that worst messed old beat up plane.  And for some reason, the fellows flew them, and was successful, and made it.  And Ms. Harrington and all the other people--I don't know--I think her husband washed out.  But anyway, the other people who you know more about that stuff than I.  But I was there actually when it started, and it was groundbreaking, all that stuff on the ground for it, but.
Speaker 2: Yeah-
Speaker 1: So Bill Davis was in the first class.  He was my professor of science at tactics at that time.  So he left Tuskegee (unclear)-- ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] and went into the Air Force as a first, one of the first cadets.  He was in the first class, along with a guy from New York.  I used to know 'em all, but right now I can't remember their name, but it'd be about ten of 'em I guess it--on the campus there.  I saw that, I knew the first ones and all that stuff, so I'm right there.
Story_ID: 75083
Speaker 1: How did you all feel?  I mean did their, did, did their presence do you think like enriched the campus?  I mean did the students, were the students impressed by the fact-
Speaker 2: Yes-
Speaker 1: --that you-
Speaker 2: --the student was--is very impressive to see.  You know, military always, you know--people always like to see brass in military.  And [General] Benjamin O. Davis went from a captain to a major I think overnight just like that, you know.  And see, and we, we, we loved Davis.  He was a good commander, and to see him go up in that class, it was nice.  It was very, kind of in lifting--enlightening--to the kids.  See, Tuskegee [University] was based on drilling anyway.  Even though when they didn't have ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps], we drilled every morning chapel.  We, we, where we'd blow--we wore blue uniforms, white shirt, black ties, black shoes.  Women wore white blouse, black tie, black skirt, black shoes.  Every Sunday we marched to chapel by the so--sound of "Onward, Christian Soldiers."  Tuskegee was always had uniforms every, ever since I ever been there.  The reasons being I understand was that Booker T. Washington didn't wanna have people (unclear) and be used, didn't want people who did  have have-nots, so he put everybody the same way, make 'em all--and they went to chapel.  You had to go to chapel on Wednesday and Sunday.  You had to drive--you had to march down on Sunday and the--had a line--and called Pass and Review, about an eighty-piece Tuskegee band, had a bandstand that played on every Sunday morning.  And it was a sight to see, that old campus and parade formation going that beautiful chapel on Sundays.  And in this chapel you always had the greatest speakers in the country always came to Tuskegee [University].  Somehow they found their way to Tuskegee.  Dr. [George Washington] Carver would speak once every year in the chapel, once a year.  And the student, quite naturally, my name being B, I was on the first row, and I was sitting right in the man's mouth almost.  'Cause, you know, B's are right in front, so I always had a front seat.  And he would speak every year and the place would be full, or the community would be trying hear Dr. [George Washington] Carver speak.  Then the other people come late and lord and late--(unclear) Lord and--Lord and Lady Halifax of England spoke there and all them people like that during that time spoke.
Speaker 1: Black and white, right?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: Black and white pe--people I guess, you know.
Speaker 2: Say what now?
Speaker 1: Black and white people-
Speaker 2: Oh, bike--black and oh yeah, black and white, everybody came and speaks.  So they'd always found their way to Tuskegee [University].
Speaker 1: Okay, we're gonna change tape right here, and-
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --pick back up.
Speaker 2: Tuskegee [University] was quite a place.
Speaker 1: It sounds like it.
Story_ID: 75304
Speaker 1: What do you think now about the condition of Tuskegee [University], you know, compared to when it--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Well, I haven't really gone back to Tuskegee [University] that much.  I really don't, haven't really looked into it too much.  When I went back I was re--I was really taken aback by how the lack of upkeep or maintenance of the property like it should be.  I think if too much emphasis is put on some of other thing and not enough on history, the buildings and keeping things promoting as they are, sometimes I think we wanna get too far out there.  Engineering, which is very good, but they could still keep some of the--could have kept some of the trades that were profitable like plumbing, electricity and where people could make a decent living, could have still been at Tuskegee [University] just as well, could have dovetailed that stuff in some type of way.  But the powers that be have nothing to do with--I cannot control that.
Story_ID: 75305
Speaker 1: Now, now when you were there, there was something else going on that has since kind of been revealed as kind of infamous rather than famous.  With all the good that Tuskegee did, and all the good things that were going on then, that they had--the medical staff over there was participating in something call the Tuskegee [syphilis] experiment.
Speaker 2: Experiment--well, I was not there.  I was there, but I didn't know anything about it then.  That did-
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what--most people didn't know, but-
Speaker 2: See, that's, that was syphilis experiment.  I don't in--didn't know anything about that.
Speaker 1: Were you shocked to find out about that?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was, I'm always shocked when people are treated that way.  I don't believe in that kind of stuff, and I'm, you know, certainly I don't agree with that.  I'd be less than a human being thinking about treating those people like that.
Speaker 1: Did you know any of the people that were-
Speaker 2: I knew none of them.  See, that was mostly in Birmingham [Alabama] and so forth.  I don't remember too much.  There are some people still living in Birmingham [Alabama].  I knew nothing about that.  Quite naturally, it was hush-hush, nobody, even the people didn't know themselves.  Quite naturally, as a student, I wasn't--you know, I didn't know anything about that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, okay, I just thought I'd read that.
Speaker 2: In fact, I, I learned it just like you did-
Speaker 1: (Unclear)-
Speaker 2: --that's through listening and through the pre--press that finally brought it out.  And the old guy who said it, he didn't--it was never that re--remo--or having any ross--remorse--feeling about it.  So I guess he's so full of hell, you know, he's still--he didn't feel sorry for killing all those people.  I read where somebody has--he say somebody had to learn somebody about the disease, so why not (unclear) us?
Story_ID: 75306
Speaker 1: So, well, after the--I mean what was graduation like at Tuskegee [University] and, and what was your-
Speaker 2: It was a big event in one's life, having gone there five years.  Let me back up just a moment. Dr. F. D. [Frederick Douglass] Patterson, when I was in my senior year I believe or thereby, came for all the presidents from all the black colleges at Tuskegee [University] and said in essence to them, people are tired of giving to us one of--one person at a time.  We must pool our re--selves together and go as a group instead of one individual to get monies and then divide among ourselves to help to sustain us.  And he envisioned that we could do this.  We could be--this could be done, and he called it a, the black colleges coming together and call it a National [sic, United] Negro College Fund.  And I was looking down his mouth when he, when he first presented that program at Tuskegee, F. D. [Frederick Douglass] Patterson, which is called the National [sic, United] Negro College Fund.  He's, he had envisioned that long during his time.  'Cause so often when you went to large companies, I think--said I don't, I don't know this for true, but someone said Dr. [Robert Russa] Moton said, who was the second president after Booker T. Washington, he went somewhere in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] or somewhere to get some money for one of the big steel mill fellows.  And the man asked him, said "Dr. [Robert Russa] Moton, I wanna ask you a question."  Dr. Morton was an African.  I never met him, but I knew his daughter, Dr. [Frederick Douglass] Patterson married his daughter.  And he had--and so doctor said, "what is it?"  I wanna ask you a question, Dr. Morton, said "why is it I'm the president of this company, and you come here asking few for money, and the people, you look out on my lot over there, they got--they're driving a car better than I can or I do?  Why is that--and don't give Tuskegee [University] the money--why is that?"
Speaker 1: I hearing you saying and why do--I'm sorry, I didn't give you-- (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: You get the question?
Speaker 1: No, what was the question that he said?
Speaker 2: He said he--the man, the, this, the, the, the executive of the steel company, which he was trying to get money from for Tuskegee [University] asked him why black people don't donate, and buy cars instead of helping the school?
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, I got you.  So he's saying that-
Speaker 2: And Dr. [Robert Russa] Moton-
Speaker 1: --black people themselves are-
Speaker 2: -said--Dr. Martin--Dr. [Robert Russa] Moton said he's really struck him a left to the jaw.  He had to come up with a good answer.  He said well--he cleared his throat--he said "you know, my people have only enjoyed these things a little while.  And you have enjoyed them so many hundred years.  And they just wanna see how they feel, probably that's the reason why they're doing it."  He said he had to come up with something, 'cause he there begging the man for money.  And the, and the man had really hit him a hard to the--lick there, asking that question.  That's one thing of the jokes I think they say said.  I didn't hear him say that, but say he said that they used to say that joke sometimes.  It was not a joke.  It was a fact that I could imagine.
Story_ID: 75307
Speaker 1: Now I went through Tuskegee [University].  I took a job teaching school like--because after I didn't take my [U.S. Army] commission, I went to school, and I went back to my home state, Louisiana, to teach school, still hadn't made been to dental school yet.  See, after this little time, had a window in there when and how I was gonna make it.  So I went to Minden, Louisiana, teaching agriculture to try to make some money to go to school eventually.  And I went to Minden [Louisiana] and went--started teaching in a small school, side of a highway, very neat school in Minden, Louisiana.  Professor was named J. R., I think J. R. Jones (unclear)--I know his last name was Jones--and he was very dictatorial and controlling.  And I first arrived there he, he was talking about the other teacher, and it wasn't any good.  I said "Mr. Jones," you know, I said "what's with him?"  He says, "I'm want to see you--son, I wanna see some--I want you to plow.  I wanna see some dirt get on shoes."  I said "my God, what have I got myself into here now?"  So I set out to try to get a job teaching out in, in Louisiana.  And I was one of the only single man on the faculty out of about twenty, twenty or twenty-five women at that time.  And I had five acres of the poorest land in Louisiana to do something with and some of the untrained students.  I had three classes of thirty-sixty minutes each to try to do something with.  And he would call me in the middle of the day, "Mr. Bush, I haven't seen you."  Well, I'd been out there working like fool trying to, you know, been working pretty hard trying to get that place going.  "I haven't seen you today."  I said "Mr. Jones, I've been working down there on the farm."  "Well, I want you to, to cut the leaves.  I want you to rake through--each give me a lot of stuff to do on the cam"--I said "I'mma take care of it Mr. Jones; I'mma take care of it."  I never would tell him I wasn't gonna do it.  I said I'll take care of it.  So he'd give me it all, and I said I'mma take care of it.  And I looked at those children and saw where they were and the way they ought to be, I couldn't in good conscience not teach.  So I just said I'll just take it.  I went on about my business and started teaching.  But he kept a diary or dossier on me, and says that one day he called me in and--well, I had gotten a county agent from Tuskegee [University], and a soil consultation agent had worked with me on some project on a plan.  And so I took a basket of stuff I raised on the farm to his superintendent, to the superintendent and his secretary, and invited him to see what I was doing on the farm.  So one day he said to me, "I've told you to do so and so and so.  You won't, you won't obey, son."  I said "yes, sir" (laughter).  He said "this is your last, this is last week--month here.  Who you gon' be in the [U.S.] Army?  I'll go by Mr. Pitcher (ph.) and tell him to get rid of you."  So when he went down to Mr. Pitcher to get rid of me, he said "Joe, have you seen what that man doing on that farm down there?"  He looked.  He said "Joe, you don't wanna get rid of him.  He ain't never had nobody work that much.  He can stay here as long as he want to."  They didn't wanna--you don't have--you don't want to get rid of him.  So, in the South, white people talk like what?  Black people.  They gossip, 'cause it's a small campus, so the white fellow was a (unclear).  He told me, he said "he can't fire you".  Then I went to the teachers and said to them, as for me and my house, I'm gon' serve the Lord.  We gon'--I'm gon' teach these children.  They gon' get my work, and they gonna get ready for college.
Story_ID: 75308
Speaker 1: During that time, however, I had a tooth I needed to be worked on.  I went to a dental office over the funeral home, a small office over the funeral home.  And there was a--sitting in the chair there was a guy named Dr. Simms.  I sat in his chair.  He looked mulatto, very light.  And he looked at my tooth.  He said "I don't have to extract your tooth.  I think I can save it."  I looked at him.  I said "you must be a good dentist (unclear)--you a good dentist."  So I said "Dr. Simms, I really wanna be a dentist."  The Lord work in mysterious ways, his wonders to perform.  So he looked down on me and said "young man, you come back and talk to me tonight."  For one year Dr. Simms and I talked about Meharry [Medical College, Tennessee] and dentistry.  I don't care how rough my day was, Dr. Simms put my head on straight.  I said "Dr. Simms, I don't have no money."  "I don't--I didn't have any either, but you gon' make 'cause I made it."  And he gave me the impetus I needed at that time in my life to go forward.  He and I became very good friends.  He was just a little older than I was, and I was young.  And he set me, my soul on fire to get me go straight.  I went to dental school.
Story_ID: 75309
Speaker 1: I finally left that job [teaching] and went to the [U.S.] Army.  They got me anyway, as a private, from New York on across the United States to Camp--to Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.  There I did a lot of chores.  I learned to cut hair and all that stuff in the [U.S.] Army.  And I had a raincoat lost, and I was going to my next base.  And they had given my mother too much money and father too much allotment money, so I, I went through the basic training without a dollar.  I said "I'll be in the [U.S.] Army till I die without getting paid.  Because I'mma raincoat short, I'm going to my next base."  And when I went to Camp Crowder, Missouri [Now Fort Crowder], I got a call from the battalion sergeant major to come, for me to come in.  And when I saw the man, he grabbed and hugged me.  That was a man I helped at Tuskegee, I was telling you about I kept in school a whole year.  He was in charge of the whole base.  He said to me, "don't worry about that raincoat.  Everything is supplied."  This is yours (unclear) and the brothers.  "Everything in the supply house I'm in charge of, so you can get as much as you want, and sent--well, you can send some to your father."  I took a fellow with me named Baker, and he got some stuff and so forth.  He said "not only that, you will have a pass as long as you're here."  That's how I met my wife [Wynona Bush].  He said "not only that, in mess hall number three is a Tuskegee [University] man.  You don't have to eat what these soldiers eat.  Just go and tell him I sent you."  So I went through the [U.S.] Army not ever, I never done a day of KP [Kitchen Police] in the [U.S.] Army.  They call that always help somebody, and Tuskegee [University] had a core--crews of commercial dietetics and most of were cooks in the [U.S.] Army.  And once they found it was me, they knew I helped so many people, 'til they tell me to ca--they told me to come on in.  And I went through with no problem.
Story_ID: 75310
Speaker 1: I went through that service, then I went through Camp Crowder [Missouri], and I went overseas to Yokohama, Japan, where we were some of the first--we were supposed to be the first troops to land before they surrendered.  So the order came down as we was in the middle of the ocean that your (unclear)--we were going to Okinawa for being (unclear) troops, for us not to go to Yokohama, to go directly in to Yoko--that ought to go to--wherever that was.  What did I say minutes ago?  Not to go to this island.
Speaker 2: Okinawa.
Speaker 1: Hmm?
Speaker 2: Okinawa or-
Speaker 1: Okinawa-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but to go straight into Japan.  So we, we took our ship into Yokohama [Japan].  And there I got a chance to see a different culture, a different people, a very defeated people, a people who felt lower than dirt because they were defeated.  But they were nice people.  To me I was kind to them, and I could see the defeat in their face because they were, you know, they were, they was bombed flat.  One little story I'm gon' tell you maybe I--well, there's so much over there.  Anyway, we had a mess hall.  We'd taken all the whole city of Yokohama [Japan].  Our dining hall and dormi--barracks sit in the middle of the city.  In the mornings we were--an order came down from Dr. Walter Eichenberger (ph.) not to feed the Japanese people any food.  If you did, they'd put you in a guard house.  These--we were supposed to take this food and take it out, put it in a large metal container, and pour gasoline on it or kerosene and burn it up.  I have never in my life seen a people so hungry.  Women would be out there early in the morning with their thongs on, babies with the caboose, or whatever you call it in the back, just shivering--go mina sa, go mina sa, give me some food.  They'd reach in that hot slop and getting that food, taking a chance on burning their hand getting that hot food out the can.  I have never seen nothing in my life.  So, I began to realize that maybe I could do a little something, maybe I'll take a chance on going to guard house.  So I fill up my mess kit full of that slop they gave me, that stuff I didn't really want, and bring it out.  And they people began to know me, called me choc' little soldier, and they'd all crowd around me to get food.  So one day I was coming out the dining hall, mess hall, and a fellow was driving with a large transportation trucks, Army sixpack--whatever you call that thing, a big old truck.  And he women were around me, in front of me.  And for some unknown reason, he wanna run over women.  And when he came down, barreled down with that truck, they scattered and left me standing there.  And the truck whizzed by my (unclear) jacket, and I fell backwards instead of forward.  That's the reason why I'm here today.  I would have lost my life, if it hadn't been for that.  So when I--from then on, when I'd come out the mess hall, I said don't get in front of me.  I'd take her around the back somewhere, get between the buildings, 'cause they may--I don't wanna get killed because they wanna kill you.  No, I don't wanna get killed too.  That's one of the things I did when in Japan.
Story_ID: 75311
Speaker 1: In Japan I've worked in dispenser with a student from Tokyo Imperial University [now University of Tokyo, Japan] all day long.  He and I talked about Japanese culture.  He took me all around Yokohama [Japan].  I've been all over the island Honshu [Japan].  And we get--began to, I began to ask him, one of the Jap--not him, but another Japanese who spoke English, said "I'm tired of the barracks.  There's so much gambling, cussing, and swearing, I got it in my brains; I'm getting addled; I'm, I'm losing my mind.  I wanna go somewhere."  So we left there one night-oh boy it's past my time--and left, left there one night, going out into the hills.  You know Jap--Japan had bathhouses and they, they're common bathhouses.  Men had one and women had one.  We passed all those and went up the hill.  We finally found a beautiful palatial home.  And there we saw this home.  I said let's go there and see how the people live.  We knocked on the door, and didn't hear nothing.  Finally, he spoke Japanese, and the woman peaked her head out, was pulling the little coat--little accordion doors open and speaked out--(unclear)--say something-"what did you can bring him here for," I guess they was saying.  And it--I said "tell her we're all right and that we're not gonna hurt them."  So she looked out, looking us over, so I pulled, pulled out my fatigue jacket.  I pulled and gave her a box of choc--a bar of chocolate candy.  So she closed the door a little bit, then she came out again, and looked us over and saw we was all right.  Then we let us inside of--you know, with the Japanese you have to take your shoes off.  We're a little place where you take your shoes off.  We got in there too, that's Baker and myself; that's the other soldier and myself.  So we got inside, then we gave another choc' bar or chocolate, and we went--then she let--opened up the large doors and let us into the living room, living room.
Speaker 2: The chocolate was a ti, the ticket?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: The chocolate was a tip-
Speaker 1: Was the ticket.  The chocolate was a ticket to getting you in there.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you know he was--so, we got inside her, her living room.  And in, in the living room was a teakwood table built with fire with foot warmers.  You ever seen that, been in a Japanese home?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: They have a thing that's built down, and you put your feet down in there.  They put your--give you some slippers to put on, then you put your feet down and sit at the table.  She brought-put on her kimono, and bought us tea to throw on the table.  Then a few minutes--about a few minutes later, out came her son, about twenty or thirty minutes after we'd been there awhile, came out speaking English as well as me and you.  He was a zero pilot and spoke English very well.  He'd gone to Columbia [University, New York].  And we began--Baker was a musician.  He played--they had a piano, so Baker began to play the piano, and he began to change the whole tenor of that conversation.  The man was a physician, Eisha (ph.), Amaha (ph.) Eisha, Devasa (ph.) Eisha, and he came out.  Then we became friends.  I used to go to his home and develop pictures.  He had large photo stack--photographic studio in his picture--his home--and we used to go there and enlarge pictures.  I used to do a lot of photographs at that time.  And we became very, very good friends.  That's one of the stories of Japan.  I had a lot of good memories of Japan 'cause I've, I always try to be helpful.
Story_ID: 75312
Speaker 1: So that was one of the stories.  When I got out of that place, I went back, came home.  Then I went to Wiley College in Marshall, Texas, to get ready for dental school, dental school.  So I prepared myself at Wiley [College], to, to retune myself, to get ready again to hit the hard rigors of Howard University [School of Dentistry, Washington D.C.].  So I went--I finished my courses at ha--at Wiley, and I entered the class of '48' [1948] at Howard University [sic, entered 1948, class of 1952].  But it's always an alligator waiting on you, isn't it?  At Howard University--now I guess you wanna end this story with this.  At Howard University--before I got to Howard [University], however, I had pains in my abdomen, and I didn't know what it was.  I thought, you know, back then any people think-- bad food or indigestion, just think I had indigestion.  So as I went to Howard [University], the food--the pain began to get more acute and more penetrating.  So I asked my classmates, I said "what must I do?  I don't wanna miss my classes, 'cause I've got Mother Moore and you got Dr. Moses [Wharton] Young, you have McKinney and all those people."  I said "now, you know, I can't"--you know, I don't--he said "go over on Georgia Avenue to Dr. Funkerbunkle (ph.) over there," or whatever his name is.  He's a good doctor.  I went over to see him and told him.  He said "what's wrong with you?"  I said "I got a pain in my stomach."  He said "do you wanna be a dentist?"  I said "I really wanna be a dentist."  So he didn't put no hands on me.  He said "well, I'm gonna give you some"--he gave one prescription, gave me some bromo [bromide] seltzer and sent me on my way.  I was eating breakfast one morning, and before I went down the hill--Howard [University] is on hills--to the medical school, just where that old bakery is, where now they have the Howard--center.  You been to Howard [University] lately, all that stuff along Georgia Avenue [Howard University Hospital]?  Well, I was just going down there, and 'fore I got on top of the hill, I got a pain in my gut as though someone stuck a dagger in me, and I folded over.  I said "Lord, have mercy.  I just can't make it."  So when I came unto myself, I straightened up and stumbled into Freedmen's Hospital--you've heard of Freedmen--and saw the intern on duty.  He said "what's wrong with you?"  I said "I'm sick.  I got pain in my stomach."  I said--well, he says--I said I might have appendix [appendicitis].  He said "don't you know that mean operation?  I'mma give you a short of morphine.  If it doesn't work, you come back."  So like a fool, I went took the shot of morphine--have to remember this is back in the '40's [1940s] now--and went to my room.  We lived up on the campus, a temporary dorm--temporary dormitories over the [McMillan] reservoir, used to call it a river, the reservoir for where Howard University across there.  They used to have dormitories up there where the Blackburn [Center] building is.  And there I was sick.  I said "Lord, I can't be sick," and these boys leave--run off leaving me and I'm here talking about sick.  You know, I couldn't be sick, thinking about all the stuff I'm missing.  That night about 10:00 I went back to the hospital, and I said to him, "Please do something for me.  I don't care what it is, operate.  I'm just, I'm really sick.  I need some help."  So about 11:00 a call went out to the surgical part of the Howard University, 11--11:30 or so, there came in the big four, Dr. Syfax, Dr. [Jack] White, Dr. Burton, and Dr. Charles Drew, the wervis--world famous Dr. Charles Drew came to my bed.  So the hour is getting late way on in the morning.  They finally admit--Jack White said to them--he's a very brilliant young fellow.  He said "whatever's wrong with this student, we're gonna find it out"--(unclear), you know, he was, he was talking before the chief, you know.  So he pushed on my abdomen, and I almost jumped out the bed.  He said this man have acute appendix [appendicitis].  Dr. [Charles] Drew said operate right now, right now.  I wanna staff--they say I would do the operation myself, except I got to go to Tuskegee to give a lecture.  And I do wanna staff man with this student.  Now which one of you gonna do it?  They asked among themselves, and so [Dr.] Burton say that--Dr. Burton said he would do it.  Do you--he said to him, do you think you need Dr. Fairfax to help you?  He said no, I think I can handle it.  So Dr. [Charles] Drew--it was about 12:00 or so--looked at me and smiled, said "young man, I've given the best you--I got, and you in good hands, and I'll see when I return."  He never returned.  So I'm Dr. [Charles] Drew's last patient he saw at Howard University, I'm it.
Speaker 2: Now he was in-
Speaker 1: I'm the last patient he saw at Freedmen's Hospital; I'm it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So when I got my honor [Estelle Coffey Memorial Award] at Howard [University], I talked about the mere moment, and I gave his daughter an award to one of the bricks we were cleaning at Howard [University].  I'm Dr. [Charles] Drew's last patient, 'cause he left that room early in the morning to hit highway to next--to get a little sleep, get on the highway.  I'm it; I'm he.
Speaker 2: So explain what happened to him for tho--he, he-
Speaker 1: He, he got-
Speaker 2: --he, he-
Speaker 1: He was coming back from Tuskegee [Alabama]-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in a car.
Speaker 2: For those who see this, you know.
Speaker 1: And he had, had an accident in North Carolina, and they wouldn't admit him to the hospital, so he bled to death.  They would've admitted him, but they wouldn't get the people with him-
Speaker 2: And-
Speaker 1: --'cause they couldn't-they thought he was white.  But the others he had, Sam Bullock, I think or somebody with him was looked my color.  And after he found--you know, he evidently, he must have saw he was black, so they didn't admit him to the hospital.  So he couldn't get in the hospital, told him to go somewhere else.  And when they got--by the time they got there, he bled to death.
Speaker 2: And ironically, he's the one who--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: He's the one that developed blood plasma, the world famous Dr. Charles Drew died for lack of blood.  And I am to go back this year at the [Dr. Charles Drew] Charter Day [School, Atlanta Georgia] and have his family--I hope to have them there in honor of him.

Speaker 1: Now what else you want me to say about Howard [University]?  Is that about the end of it?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, we--it could be 'cause we--I wanna get to Long Beach [California] and you know-
Speaker 1: Well, I mean I could tell you-
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous)--practice-
Speaker 1: Well, okay, you wanna talk about Long Beach [California]?
Speaker 2: --before you have to-
Speaker 1: Okay, so anyway, I went Long--I came to Long Beach [California].  And when I got to Long Beach, the first--I gotta call from Ms. Mary P. Mack, saying "Dr. Bush, we want you to become president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]."
Speaker 2: You'd just got here?
Speaker 1: I'd just got in town [Long Beach, California], so to speak, had one baby [David Earl Bush] and another one [Ronald Barrett Bush] on the way, had instead of an office--didn't have, you know, just trying to get started.  A good soldier always go up on a hill and make a record in order before you go into, in battle.  I didn't know what I was doing, didn't know anything about the NAACP that much, and I didn't understand what this stuff she's talking about.  She was talking about the (unclear) at Poly High School, Technical High School [Long Beach Polytechnic High School, California] and the students.  The white kids went to one place, and the black kids went to another place.  Now who gonna do this?  You see, during that years, the people were frightened and scared to death.  They were afraid to, to venture out, 'cause they would lose their jobs.  So a person like me was self-employed would be a right person to sick on 'em and get that done, but I didn't know what I was doing.  So I had to sit down and told 'em, you know, I couldn't take the job.  I had to then sit down and study Long Beach [California] and find out what Long Beach problems was.  And I began to study Long Beach.  I put a lot of studying in Long Beach.  What's, what, what make Long Beach stick?  And I began to find out that--I would stumbled upon--there are two things--two or three things that came together.  Number one, the job--people who issued the job at the jobs department of employment would not send black people out on jobs.  If you call in this area in which black people lived, they say they didn't have jobs.  Go to Los Angeles [California].  So all the kids from [Long Beach] Poly[Technic] High School who had business skills, they had to go to LA [Los Angeles, California].  They couldn't get there in Long Beach [California].  Then I had to find out how we could break them down.  I don't know how these things happened.  Somehow it all worked together.  I happened to meet a classmate of mine at Wiley College [Texas].  I happened to see him work at in Compton [California].  I see wrote--I asked him what needed, told me he did a job interview.  I said what is that?  He said I send people out on jobs.  Well, I knew he had a problem in jobs in Long Beach with the department down there.  He said to me there's gon' be an opening coming up soon for an examination.  I said is that right?  Then here come Governor [Pat] Brown, almost simultaneously.  No, the bull--no, let me back up.  Here comes George Tolls, who was in charge of jobs, came to speak to the NAACP on that Sunday.  And he lulled these old Negroes like they were dirt.  When he left the build, he said to me, doctor, those people don't know what they're talking about.  I said I'll get you here.  Just give me time, I'll get you here.  Now back to Governor [Pat] Brown.  Governor [Pat] Brown came in sometime during that time trying to run for a second term, and he needed votes from black people.  So he had us to organize a group in the community, something that wasn't--make sure it Communist, 'cause everything there was, you know, scared of Communists.  And we met in St. John's Baptist Church basement, and they all are lawyers and--what few blacks they had in Long Beach [California] were a stone in Governor [Pat] Brown's virtue, and I didn't say a thing.  I was so disgusted I didn't know what to do.  So the guy looked at me, said, "Doctor, everyone has spoken except you."  I said, "I don't think you wanna hear what I got to say, 'cause I'm very displeased with Long Beach and its system of the way they handle things."  I said, "The Department of Employment don't send me out on jobs, how can I expect the private industry to do"--you mean--I said, "Yes, my eyes 20/20."  I said, "They gonna be a, a ja--a job interview"-"It's gonna be a job interview given at such and such a time for, for the--I mean it's gon' be an exam given for this position.  So you get somebody ready, and we'll make an appointment in that office."
Speaker 2: Okay, let's pause here, and we'll change this tape.
Story_ID: 75028
Speaker 1: Now, yeah, okay, so Long Beach [California], the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], you were talking about.
Speaker 2: Well, I was, I was telling you about the George Tolls and he told me to--let me talk--let me hold, I just want to get it right.  We had to get some--we had this meeting with Governor Brown, secre- appointment secretary.
Speaker 1: This Pat Brown, right? Back in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Pat Brown, Sr., secretary and we met in St. John's [Baptist Church] basement.  And all extolled Governor Brown's virtues except me and so he looked at me and said, "Dr., everyone has said something but you."  I said, "I don't think you'd wanna hear what I got to say.  While Governor Brown's a good governor, but he isn't doing anything in Long Beach to help me or help the people, not me particularly, get jobs from the department of employment because the way job--that's the way jobs originated.  How do I expect private industry to look at me if the governor, government is not treating me fair?"  "You mean to tell--."  I said, "I'm looking, my eyes' 20/20.  I'm telling you what I'm--."  "You get somebody ready, we'll put him in there."  So my wife and I got a notice out to all the churches to please send back to Xavier [University], Dillard [University], Central [State University], Ohio State, or wherever, wherever the schools were, to get someone out to take this exam.  At that time, they were paying about seven thousand or eight thousand [dollars] a year.  That was a lot of money then, and 'cause the examination was difficult.  It was job interviewer and wasn't paying very good.  Well, I'd preached all I could in two or three churches and as much as I could, and I sent notice to the rest of them.  When the examination met, there were two were successful.  So I got a call, "Dr., we're ready to make an appointment, but two people that pass the exam don't want to take the job, and we're ready to make an appointment to the office."  So I said to him, I said, "Give me time.  I'll find you someone to go in there."  I had to go over my mind over and over.  It was a fellow in Long Beach named Joseph T. Brooks, who was [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.]'s classmate, went to Morehouse [College].  Well, he had been passed over in the [U.S.] Navy, and his wife was a principal of a school in Long Beach, and he didn't have a real job.  He messed around trying to get something going, and he was going to USC [University of Southern California] a little while here and then he was selling insurance.  And I could not buy all the insurance that Joe was selling, so I know what Joe needed was a real job.  So I called his wife.  I said, "Beryl, where's Joe?"  "Oh he's so and so." I said, "Go down--tell him to go down on Broadway downtown to the department of employment office, wherever it is downtown L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  I got a job for him, and I'm sure it's an exam to be given.  I'm sure he can pass the exam."  So when Joe went down there and took the--make the--the makeup exam or the special exam, he passed it.  I got a call two or three days later.  "Dr., you sent the right man, and we're gonna make an appointment of Joseph T. Brooks this offer immediately."  So when Joseph T. Brooks came to the window, a tickler file went out the window.  I would get a call from Joseph T. in the middle of the day, say, "Bush, I need ten men to go out on the Avenue," on Orange Avenue at that time and Anaheim [Street] was where the black commerce was and black people hung out, "and make an announcement and tell them to come to my window, Harriet Tubman."  So I'd leave my office, which was located in front of (Unclear) and Atlantic [Avenue], and go down and announce to the people do you want a job, do you need a job, do you need a job.  And we broke all that stuff down.  That's how that with Brown was broken down.  When Joseph T. Brooks took that little job on the Kennedy administration, became the West Coast regional director of civil rights or whatever that part of the--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Equal Opportunity Employment?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right, he took a--he became a West Coast region, including Hawaii and all the West Coast.  That job sent him way up there from that little beginning.  So we were able to help to get a lot of people jobs and mix the stuff, break it down.
Story_ID: 75029
Speaker 1: We then took on a Long Beach [California] city college at, at, at another stage in my life for trades.  I came in town preaching trades.  Mrs. [HM Dale] Clinton could have told you that.  I preached that all the time when I first came here.  I see they set on the streets and not doing anything.  "Why don't you get a--(unclear) you're not a trade.  Why don't you get trade?  Why don't you get a trade?  Why don't you learn to be a plumber or electrician?"  It wasn't as pay--high paying as it is now, but it was still always good.  Now you know plumbers make a heck of a lot of money now, big money.  So here I am preaching all that stuff, getting a trade.  And one day one fellow worked for me and he was a youngster who I said, why don't you get your license?  Said they won't let him in school down in Long Beach [California] City College.  I say, "won't let you in school?  What do you mean won't let you school?"  So, I said "get on the phone and call them."  He called Long Beach City College, and they called it--used to call it Long Beach Technical Branch at that time.  He called them.  So he was trying to see--I said give me the phone.  I took the phone, I said "I'm Dr. Bush."  Well, quite naturally, the secretary then went and got Dr. Plush (ph.) who was in charge of the department.  And I began to talk to him about the kids going and getting in trades.  He said "come down and have lunch with me, and I'll go over the program with you."  Well, during that time, way back in the '50's [1950s], or whenever it was, I could--I called a professional we had in town.  I say I got to have an appointment with Dr. Plush down in Long Beach [California], BTD, called it technical branch of [Long Beach] city college.  I'm busy.  I'm busy.  Everybody busy except me, and my time should have been worth it as much as a plumber.  So there's a woman in Long Beach that I'd helped her son-in-law come out to Cal--California, named Dr. Richard Simms.  And his mother-in-law was here from, she was from New Orleans [Louisiana] coming in to visit him.  She did a lot of civil rights work back in New Orleans [Louisiana].  So I thought about her.  I said let me take her with.  "Ms. Railey (ph.), are you busy?"  "No, doctor, I'm at"--I say "well, you wanna go with me down to Long Beach City College, and I wanna show you how these people can act."  So she dressed and I picked her up, and she and I went to Dr. Plush's office in Long Beach City College Technical Branch on Pacific Coast in Cal--in Orange Avenue [Long Beach, California].  And I--we had lunch, we talked, and we came back.  After lunch we talked some more.  So he said to me, "Doctor, you see why they're not"--I said you--well, as I looked at my watch, I said "Dr. Plush, I wasted two hours of my time.  What you talking about I, you know, I--you know, I don't want to hear that."  You said Smith-Hughes [National Vocational Education Act, 1917], the Smith-Hughes Act was started back there during Booker T. Washington days.  And Smith-Hughes started when people were leaving the rural going to the urban area to be trained.  It had nothing to do with color or anything.  It's just a matter of people leaving from farm to city and county (unclear) reimburse.  Well, I had the Smith-Hughes Act when I was trained in agriculture, focused on agriculture.  We saw I knew what I was talking about.  So I said to him, "if I don't get some answers to my question, I'm gon' call Governor Brown.  When you don't have facts"--the lawyer say "when you don't have facts, what do you?  Hit the desk" (laughter) (unclear).  And the books of the plumber's open.  And people began to--several of the guys became journeymen through, through the apprenticeship training program, from which the many of their families, other members became plumbers.  When the salt vaccine was being taken on Long Beach City [College] Cambus--Campus--and Watts [neighborhood, Los Angeles, California] had burned down [Watts riots, 1965], Dr. Plush looked at me and said you or Dr. Bush.  That's--well, I'd forgotten all about it, because when I do something for you I don't remember it.  And he said to me "I thought you was a radical man I'd ever known, but I--people that listened--we'd have listened to people like you, Watts riot would've never been."  I said "Yes, Dr. Plush.  That's all I was trying to do, is to get jobs for all people to become useful citizens, and they wouldn't burn the place down."
Speaker 2: Yeah, it doesn't seem to make sense to stockpile people-
Speaker 1: Hmm?
Speaker 2: It doesn't seem to make sense to have people coming in that don't have any useful to do.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: So what (unclear)--gainful-
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: --employment.
Speaker 2: Yeah, what are they expecting to-
Speaker 1: Right, but tear the place down.  So, there's (unclear) now all of Long Beach [California].  I helped sa--several people get elected and all that stuff, so I don't know if we (unclear)--anything else you wanna know?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, well, yeah, what, what are some of your--what are your--so you were head of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  Did you ever head the NAACP?
Speaker 1: No, no, I never-
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: --did head it.
Speaker 2: But you were a member of the (unclear)-
Speaker 1: I'm a very--I mean I'm a life member of the [NAACP] Golden Heritage and all the rest of it.
Speaker 2: All right. Okay.
Story_ID: 75030
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black commun--community today?
Speaker 2: What are my hopes?
Speaker 1: Yes and concerns.
Speaker 2: For Long Beach [California] or the whole everywhere?
Speaker 1: The, this community in-
Speaker 2: For blacks
Speaker 1: --particular and the black community in general.
Speaker 2: Black community in general, I would--my hopes and aspirations 'fore I leave this earth is that we would learn to live as a people and learn to trust one another, and educate ourselves, even though not necessarily high schools, but learn to get some skills and training, and learn to become entrepreneurs and not so many consumers.  Ownership of something and begin to own part of the country, and people would have more respect for you when you own something.  When you don't have own--we don't own a decent crack of--we don't even own a decent mom and a pop store, not even in Chicago [Illinois], basic for the number of people there--very few.  I must digress just a moment and tell you a story, and I'm gonna probably could end this with two three stories I guess.  I was at Howard University [Washington D.C.] some years ago, when I got invited to the White House by the [President George H. W.] Bushes.  They saw that picture back there.  Tuskegee [University] was invited, and I was one of the ones that went to the White House.  So I stayed on Tuskegee's--on Howard's campus.  Howard [University] had a hotel at the time.
Speaker 1: Howard Inn [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Howard Inn.  Well, I stayed there.  And I got hungry so I told my wife [Wynona Bush] I'm going up on the block where it was an old building that the bakery shop used to own, was finally leased out and turned into a shopping center, mall, like a strip mall like.  And in this place was a Jamaican place, restaurant, which would have had rice and beans.  And I like Jamaican food 'cause I like rice and beans.  And I went in that place to get some food, and I saw a young brother sitting at the cash register, looked like he had some intelligence.  So I asked him, I said "do you own this place?"  "No, man.  I couldn't own this place.  It's a franchise."  I said "where do you go to school?"  "Howard [University]."  "What are you taking?"  "Business."  And out came an Asian.  I looked back in the kitchen and I didn't see anything but Jamaicans back there cooking the food.  So when he turned and went back in the back, I said to him "don't you ever let me tell you--hear me--tell you can't own this place.  Go down in--on Georgia Avenue and Florida Ave--Georgia and Florida Avenue in front of Howard [University]'s new hospital.  There's an old building there.  Two or three of you get--two or three of you get that building retrofitted and put the same thing there.  You can own anything you wanna own.  If you have faith you can do it.  Don't ever let me tell me you can't own this thing and you're taking business."  So I got a call from the Office of Management Development from Howard [University].  We were arguing about my donation to Howard [University].  I've given Howard quite a lot of money.  And he had some kind of--they had some kind of thing about that Howard [University], the money you give would have to be given in five-year increments.  And after sending two kids through medical school and so forth, and even if I wanna give a hundred thousand, I can't give it all and that short period.  I got to give it over a long period of time.  So I had given Howard [University] quite a bit of money, and they wasn't giving me credit for it.  And I said what kind of mess--I began to argue with them.  His name is Burt King, was in charge of this particular businessman with Howard [University].  So I said to him, "does Howard [University] own that building the students are in?"  "No, no."  I said "where did you go to school?"  "Harvard [University].  I got my MBA from Harvard."  I say "so well and good.  I went to a little old black school they call Tuskegee in Alabama.  And Booker T. bought everything in sight.  The campus is about four hundred acres.  That campus is far, more farther than you actually seen there, way back, it goes way back up there."  And I said--and I told him a story about this kid taking business, working this place, and have no dreams or hope.  And I said "what are we training people to become flunkies or entrepreneurs?"  I say "it's a disgrace for you even picking with such an assurance that you're training people to do what?"  I say "it's disgraceful," and I, you know, I forgot about my (unclear).  I got on him.  So I could see him getting angry (unclear).  He got angry with me, but six months later he bought the building, and he sent me an invitation to the ribbon cutting.  So Howard [University] own that as a training center now for training entrepreneurs.  And I didn't say had him buy to building, but I certainly enjoy their member.  Because some (unclear) is there that bought the building, they wouldn't have got that, and they bought it.  That's what I did for Howard [University]-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and many other things.  So now Howard [University] owns that building.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's a center for training.  And the president speaks very affectionate and--about the training center he have there and all the computers.  I went there last time and looked at all the stuff they got going on there, for which I am very grateful that it's done.

Speaker 1: You're very committed to getting--trying to encourage black pe--people to own things, right, and to-
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --get their own businesses and to--do, do you see that as your legacy or-
Speaker 2: What now?
Speaker 1: Do you, do you see that as part of your legacy that you-
Speaker 2: Well, I see it part of not only my legacy, this is black people legacy too.  As you may or may not recall, you were too young and probably didn't even think about being born at that time, and I wasn't too much--I wasn't--black people used to own land, gins, and we owned far less just after slavery than we own now.  We used to own cities.  Tulsa, Oklahoma, was one of the finest cities.  The Sweet Auburn [Alabama], Auburn was (unclear) (unclear)--Atlanta, Georgia, was millionaires (unclear) down the street.  We own nothing.  We used to own all that stuff.  People owned land and gins and acres and acres of stuff.  We don't wanna think.  Our children is just getting further and further away.  Where are we?  What are doing?  You're working for someone at some corporation, and when you get 40 years or 50 years old, what do they do?  They don't fire you.  They downsize you and you're out door.  Where do you?  You ain't got nothing but overspent.  You know, you're living from paycheck to paycheck.  I see nothing when--nothing, and that I think it was Joseph who said in the Bible when the king had a dream, he said if you could find out someone who could interpret his dream, and I don't--you know the story--and Joseph told the king there'd be seven years of lean years and seven years a plenty.  I've always told people let in your life--you, you living in your fruitful years 'cause you're young.  I told you, save your health because there are gonna be years when you get like me and you be burnt out if you don't be careful, same thing with your money.  When you making money, set--put some away, because it's gon', you know--there's no sense in everybody being on the county.  We don't have to be.  We got just as much opportunities than all these other people around here with the eyes different from ours.  They own--they're gon' own the country, and we can do the same thing.  And I'm, I'm not talking against the people.  What I'm preaching now, us now, we need to own some of this stuff and stop all foolishness.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: We buy up big cars.  That's all we think about, you know-
Speaker 1: (Unclear)-
Speaker 2: --consumers of (unclear)--consumers-
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: --consumption.
Speaker 1: A big salary is not the equivalent of ownership-
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: A big salary.  A lot of people now wanna make a big salary-
Speaker 2: Oh, that's all right.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: But save some money, 'cause they gon' let you go as soon as you get old.  You don't want a company?  You gon' wear out.  They'll burn you up and wear you out.  What does American Airlines do when they get overspent?  They, they downsize.  The big executives are gone.  They can make a hundred thousand, two hundred and they have to go.  You ain't saving nothing, you gone.  It's simple as that.  I didn't say it's wrong to make a big salary.  Save some of it while you're making it.  Put it in some investment and give somebody else a job.

Speaker 1: Now, sir, did your parents get a chance to see you become a success?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were at my graduation, both of 'em were.  And when my father [Ebenezer Bush, Sr.] stopped farming, I set him up a little grocery store.  And he stayed and he ran that grocery store, and then, and then they became the Ed Hudson I knew back when I was a boy.  They had the same kind of store, full of everything.  My father turned that store into a very successful business.  And everybody around Shreveport [Louisiana] knew that, that (unclear)--knew him.  He turned his farm success in to that store.  So I set the store up for him when I left (unclear).  And-
Speaker 1: And you were telling me earlier when we first came in that your son [Dr. Ronald Barrett Bush] owns this building here.
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: You, you were tell, telling me earlier that your son owns this building that we're sitting in right now.
Speaker 2: Yes, this building's in his name.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And he's in Palm Desert [California] now.  He's an internist and one [Dr. David Earl Bush] is a cardiologist.  And if he wants to he can come in and take this building.  When I get out of it, he can take this building.  I don't wanna think about my son so much.  People often ask me, "Dr. Bush, I know you're so happy your sons are doctors."  Yes, and I tell them only for a moment am I happy.  When I look about me and go all over the United States, and I do travel all the time, whether it's New York, Chicago [Illinois], Washington, D.C., wherever it is, I see so much unemployment, so much depravation, so many people unemployed or underemployed, nothing, just lives wasted.  I used to be a jail (unclear) Washington, D.C., in charge of the prison system.  And I look out on the yard every morning, it's nothing but black people out there, young black men.  So I can't be but so joyful about my children.  Yes, they're doctors, but I don't worship them.  They're already doctors and good doctors.  What can I do for your son or somebody who wanna get there?  So my job is try to get others there.  As my sons have made it, I want the others to make it.  I often said to people, if there were two scholarsh-"if it was one scholarship to be given, and my son and someone as equally qualified, and I had the money to pay my son's way, I'd rather your son have the scholarship."
Speaker 1: Why, why would you do that?
Speaker 2: Because we have two doctors instead of one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's the reason why.
Story_ID: 75033
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as one who passed his ways--as people have helped me, I try to help and leave a helping hand.  It was Jesus who said let--it was Jesus who said let your light so shine before men that they will see the good works in you and glorify me.  I don't wanna, I don't be glorified.  I'm glorified to God, Jesus' work.  I just wanna be remembered as someone tried out to help a little bit along the way, 'cause truly I've been helped.  I've had some ups and downs, but I far more ups than I had downs.  And it's been a wonderful ride as I get off the scene and begin to think about it.  I've helped a lot of people.  A lot of people have helped me.  And that's all life's all about and so much me, me, I, I. It's, it's helping everyone.  In this office, I helped a young Mexican girl who finished dental school 2002 on May, May the 10th, she came out of--became a dentist because of my tutor she be--she's a dentist today--could have been a Mexican, could have been you, could have been a white, black.  I'll help anybody.  I don't care which color you look like.  If you need help, I'm gon' help you.  I'm gonna reach down and get you, because I knew one thing, I'm not gonna live always.  And the only thing you do for Jesus will count.  All rest of is just drifting sand--care how much know, you just die like men.  That's all, everybody die like men.  Only Jesus Christ is the only one.  And when you feel good when you're able to reach out and get that person who really wanna help, regardless of what he looks like, help him.  That's what I was taught in my home.  I never had a lot of hate in my home.  My father never hated anyone.  We never talked hate to--we didn't hate white people.  I don't care how bad they were, we didn't hate him.  I felt sorry for 'em, because I knew as a boy I had to live a, the, the economy of life.  First I had to be inferior, but yet and still superior.  And it always took me aback.  Number one, in order for me to get a job I had to be better.  And the first thing they said boy, are we--I ain't gon' hire you with the white man.  You gotta do more than this white man, 'cause I know I had to do more, so I had to be (unclear).  (Unclear)--had to be inferior, so they always kept me kind of, you know, (laughter) (unclear) up 'cause I had to be inferior but yet and still superior, you see.  And not only me, all the rest of 'em who had a job.  And I used to remember that.  And I could see my father could out think the white people his age.  He can figure-- out think 'em.  So I said wasn't no--it was race had nothing to do with it, just a matter of a human being.  That's the way I look at life, just you need, you help 'em.
