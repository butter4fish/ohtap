Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe. I'm the interviewer today with the HistoryMakers. Our videographer is Matthew Hickey. Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Oliver G. McGee III, O-L-I-V-E-R, G stands for George, G-E-O-R-G-E, McGee, M-C-G-E-E, the third.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: October 28, 1957, from Cincinnati, Ohio, the Queen City.
Speaker 1: Okay. And, sir, what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: I'm professor of mechanical engineering at Howard University, and I'm its former vice president for research and compliance.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: 9, 11, 2012. Eleven years after our great historic event. Well.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're in my home in Washington, D.C., right in Georgetown overlooking the Grand Pennsylvania Avenue, and right down the window opposite me is the White House.
Story_ID: 626161
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we ask as sort of a warm-up. They only require a short answer. The first one is: Do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do. I love salmon (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm a fish guy.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do. The color of my wonderful speakers, mulatto.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Fall.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I love the fall. I love the change of the foliage. I tremendously love how Georgetown looks in the fall season. Absolutely beautiful. Last year, my sister was here and I gave her a gift for visitation to Washington, D.C. We went to Martin Luther King's statute unveiling, and we took a walk through Dumbarton Oaks and saw the fall foliage and smelled the colors that were in our backyard where we grew up. So, fall is a lovely time of the year for me.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Yes. Cambridge, England. I love the University of Cambridge.
Speaker 1: Alright. And the last one is: Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes. "Our words create our world." How we put our words together says so much about the world we're creating. In my business, I have to run a lot of words in books.
Story_ID: 626162
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Yes, Larry. My mother is Jean Steal Arnold, J-E-A-N, Steal, S-T-E-A-L, Arnold, A-R-N-O-L-D.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: February 4th, 1938.
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: Cincinnati, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family? How far back can you trace them, and what were they doing in history?
Speaker 2: I was taking a look at my mother's side of the family as I was writing my latest book, so I had an opportunity to kind of really delve into her background. The family--the Arnold side of the family comes from Georgia. They're a family of artistic people, creative people; music, art, creative expression. They moved up North to Cincinnati [Ohio] in search of freedom, diversity. My family is--my mother's side of the family is a family that's committed to looking at diversity issues from my grandfather, Arnold, to--down to my mother, and looking at how bringing more people into the fold of creative--creativity and expression. And my mom just devoted most of her life towards that, and I think she got that from my grandfather, Arnold. And also--.
Speaker 1: And what was his full name?
Speaker 2: Gene Arnold.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: J-E--. It's, G-E-N-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the reason they are--well, my grandfather is named Gene, G-E-N-E. He named his son, which is my uncle Gene, so we had to call him, Yogi. So he's Yogi so we don't confuse him with Grandfather Gene, and he named his daughter, G-A-E-A-N, Gaean. So we have to call her Ziggy, so we don't confuse the Genes (laughs). And since there're also three Oliver's in my family, my grandfather Oliver George, the senior; Oliver George Jr., and Oliver George the third; they call me after my dog, Weebee. We are--we're really a confused family because we all named each other the same (laughs). So we have to come up with nicknames so we can all tell each other apart, or we'll all be saying, "Hello, hello, hello." (laughs). So.
Speaker 1: That's an interesting the way to do it. I mean, only your family members--it would take a while to get oriented to the names, I guess if you come in from the outside.
Speaker 2: Yeah. When my friends find out all of the nicknames, they really find them funny. I'm calling Yogi, and then I'm calling Ziggy, and then I'm calling Weebee (laughs). We're--I think we named all ourselves after cartoon characters (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, was it your grandfather who moved the family from Georgia to Cincinnati?
Speaker 2: Yes, because I think he was looking for an expression. He's a wonderful artist, and I think a lot of the genes went from the art side through me to my sister, Brenda, who is really an extraordinarily talented--Brenda McGee--a talented artist. I have a number of her works in my house here. She just could--just beautifully do wonderful, just spectacular art. And so, he came to do his expression for that. At that time, Grandpa Arnold was really trying to sell his art during a time when it was very difficult for black artists to launch themselves. So he came to Cincinnati to where his art was a little more in demand.
Speaker 1: Now, when did he come to Cincinnati?
Speaker 2: I think he came about the time when my mom was 17 or so. Well, maybe no. I think she was about 14, and then--and that's when he came up in that time.
Speaker 1: Okay. So during the 1940s?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm. In the 1940s. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, '50s [1950s]. If she was born '38 [1938]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: --and she was 17--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when he came up. Yeah, that's in the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: About the 1950s.
Speaker 1: Yeah. That was '55 [1955].
Speaker 2: And that was a tough time for a black artist then. And he was an independent, small entrepreneur.
Speaker 1: Now was he a painter or?
Speaker 2: A painter, hand drawer, lithographs. All of that. But he was probably a small business owner, if you might want to use their terms today. And that's how he was able to support the family.
Speaker 1: So he was actually able to support the family by--with artwork?
Speaker 2: That's right. And he was going back and forth through New York as well. And so, quite a bit of the art community came down from the SoHo [New York] all through Cincinnati, because Union Terminal was connected to--the Cincinnati Union Terminal was in connection to the gateway of Penn Station and Grand Central Station. So a lot of the art was--club was able to traffic through that. And quite a bit of music, particularly jazz, flowed through Cincinnati. That's it was also flowing through Cleveland and Chicago [Illinois]. So, that's a (unclear) and tie them in together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, he was involved in that in the West End of Cincinnati. And his sisters, my aunt Mary, and Aunt Bee, and Aunt Willa, and Aunt Eva; they were all through the West End of Cincinnati where a lot of the creative culture in the black community was taking place during that time.
Story_ID: 626163
Speaker 1: And what kind of art does your sister Brenda do?
Speaker 2: She does painting, lithograph. I think the best talent that I have in my house and I've preserved of my sister's talent has been how she draws people. And that is one of the most difficult forms of art is to be able to draw the human face or of the human body or the human figure in detail lithographs. And I will show you those in the other room. They are splendid. The detail and the structure and how she can do that, and I've come to understand that really, really good artists, which I'm not an artist, but I'm a scientist, but drawing the human body is one of the most, if I can think of it scientifically, one of the most nonlinear forms to be able to draw, because there're so many nuances, and expressions, and interpretations that an artist has to take to be able to draw the human body, and to really see the soul in the human body. And that's what my sister has an absolute talent to do. When you see her expressions and how she drew us as children, and then be able to see how she creates that energy that we had growing up, it's--they're dynamic, and I treasure them. I actually have six of her lithographs in the other room.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 626164
Speaker 1: Let me ask this: Now, in terms of your family history, are any stories in your family about Emancipation or slavery or Reconstruction and how that played out in Georgia where they lived?
Speaker 2: I don't know of that yet, although I'm exploring it. I do know that we come out of a Seminole Indian tribe in Florida; the heritage I should say, the Seminole Indian heritage out of Florida, and how that was merged up towards the Mason-Dixon line. But I'm still exploring that, because I'm putting that together in my coming book, "Jumping the House: All My Life." And I want to be able to tell more of that lineage and so forth. And I'll tell you, it's a really wonderful process when someone is really trying to lay those historical aspects of one's life. And I know you can appreciate that, Larry, because are a historian. And as I've studied science and writing about other areas of politics and economics that are related to the mathematical modeling of science and engineering, I have had to really understand the analysis of history and how rigorous that is, and then be able to pull those pieces together and matching the research appropriately. So I'm tracing that together right now.
Speaker 1: Okay. Alright
Story_ID: 626165
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [Jean Arnold] grow up in Georgia? Now, what town in Georgia was it that she was from?
Speaker 2: I had that in my mind. Macon, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Macon. Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, your mother grew up in Macon, and when she was 17 she moved to Cincinnati?
Speaker 2: It was around about like 12 or 13, 14. In that period of time, mid-'50s [1950s]. Not mid-'50s [1950s], but the early '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Because she had me in about five years or so, five or six years later. And I was an early arrival.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, did your mother--now, was she able to go to--finish high school and go to college?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes. My mom went to Cincinnati Hughes High School. My dad went to Cincinnati Woodward High School, where I graduated from later. Cincinnati Woodward. And they met at a high school dance.
Speaker 1: Well, I'm going to ask you about that in a minute.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I have to get to his history first. I'm trying to just establish your mother's high school credentials. So she came out of Hughes High School. Now, did she go to college (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, and nor did my father. I'm the first person in my family to graduate from college.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, did your mother share with you an aspiration that she had, that she was thinking about when she was young growing up? I mean an occupation that she saw herself doing, and was she able to achieve it?
Speaker 2: My mom spent the first 26 years of her life, and particularly from the time I was born, which I came around 18--when she was 18--to 26, 27, she was raising us; myself, my sister, Brenda and my sister, Sherry. And my cousin, Maurice, came to live with us when I was five, because his mother was killed. And so he--my father adopted him, and he became my de facto brother. And she raised us. And she was a, as they may say today, a homemaker.
Speaker 1: Now that's fine. I just wondered if she had an aspiration. Like some people want to sing or they want to do art work or they want to be a nurse or a teacher. Did she ever have those ideas that she wanted to have an occupation, you know, beyond being a homemaker?
Speaker 2: My mom was a--she inherited from her dad, I think, a desire as a socialite. She valued education tremendously. She is probably the most self-educated person, and the quick study that I know. She had aspirations to be able to go into education, so she followed us into our, really a charter school at that time, North Avondale Elementary, and she parked herself inside the principal's office. And the reason she did that is, she wanted to watch us in school. It was a very special school for training young kids in the Cincinnati School District. And so, I was a kid that had my mother in the principal's office. And I was a little frisky and a little rambunctious, so I as the kid that was known that, "Your mom is in the principal's office, and so, if you don't behave, we're going to tell on you." And I think the teacher's kind of knew that too, because they kept wanting to pull me out of reading so they could put me in the hallway, and she would come out there and say, "Why is my son in the hallway?" And that, what she was trying to do is protect me at the time, because oftentimes when black--young black kids were coming in with a little bit of aspirations and a little bit of smarts--I could count. I was very good at math. Not so good reading, but I could read before I got to school. But sometimes I might have been a little--she said I may have been a little bored in the circles, and so, I got frisky and rambunctious. And so, what they did is they either put you in the corner or put you out in the hall. And she would come down and complain to the teacher or complain to the principal, "Why is my son sitting in the hallway when the instruction is going on in the classroom?" So it was good to have her in the school. And I think what she was having an aspiration was is to be in education, to work in education administration, and even go into a higher form of education, which she eventually did. So I think that was coming early in her life.
Story_ID: 626166
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Oliver George McGee Junior. Spelled just like mine, O-L-I-V-E-R, George, G-E-O-R-G-E, McGee, M-C-G-E-E, Junior.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: November 4th, 1936. And he was born in Cincinnati, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Almeda McGee and Oliver George McGee Senior (laughs). And my grandfather was named George McGee and he's the direct descendant from the Seminole. He was part Native American.
Speaker 1: Now, your grandfather is Oliver McGee Senior, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And my great-grandfather--
Speaker 1: And your great-grandfather--.
Speaker 2: --is George McGee.
Speaker 1: Okay. Alright.
Speaker 2: And he married Odella Harley to become Odella McGee. That was my great- grandmother. And they were married in 1921.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what's the story about your father's side of the family? I mean, are they--can you trace them beyond Cincinnati to someplace in the South or does the family history sort of start there?
Speaker 2: The family history on my dad's side of the family goes to Battle Creek, Michigan, near Kellogg's [food manufacturer]. That's what I recall and being in the state of Michigan. I think they were going there for work. At that time, and you can imagine, black life, you go where the jobs are. And it seemed to be if you wanted to get away from the fields, if you're an historian, you go to the industrial Midwest, the industrial North, and you find jobs in industrial policy of American, which was Kellogg's, Post, GM, Ford, Chrysler. And you--they took you to parts north to Cleveland [Ohio], and on to Detroit [Michigan], and Battle Creek, Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, was it your great-grandfather who was in Battle Creek, settling the family in Battle Creek, or was that your grandfather?
Speaker 2: Grandfather.
Speaker 1: Oka.
Speaker 2: My great-grandfather stayed south.
Speaker 1: Now, where was his home?
Speaker 2: In Sadesville [sic, Sadieville], Kentucky.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry. How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy. I knew you were going to ask me that. I think it's--
Speaker 1: It's Sadesville, Kentucky.
Speaker 2: Sadesville--Sadesville, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Sadesville.
Speaker 2: Yeah. S-A-D-E-S-V-I-L-L-E. I remember it being a farm, where as a kid I went there and ate too much food. My great-grandmother could make some butter rolls that I still smell today. But it's right outside of Lexington, Kentucky, Larry.
Speaker 1: Okay. Right side of Lexington--outside of Lexington.
Speaker 2: That's right. So when I went as a child, I remember taking long trips to Battle Creek, Michigan, to see my grandfather, and then taking long trips to outside of Lexington, Kentucky, south to see my great-grandfather and my great-grandmother.
Story_ID: 626167
Speaker 1: Now, are there any stories on your father's [Oliver George McGee, Jr.] side of the family about slavery or Reconstruction or, you know, Emancipation or, you know?
Speaker 2: Again, I'm really researching that. I think probably what I'm finding is that is probably going to be more towards linkages to Native American, going towards Sitting Bull. And--
Speaker 1: Sitting Bull?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I grew up under--I got to check this. It's called--yeah, I guess we'd call them Washington's Fact Check (laughs), but I heard that a lot growing up.
Speaker 1: Now what's the story? What's the story about Sitting Bull?
Speaker 2: That my great-grandfather is a descendant of him, and I have gotten pictures and compared them, and they look a lot alike. Though it has piqued my curiosity, I am looking into Ancestry.com. You know that website they have? So I'm going to explore that, you know. I think that's a great service for all of us as Americans, because we get to really find out, you know, where are we and who are we. We're all basically six degrees of separation as we commonly know. But the exploration of finding out who we are, and especially as we're in later parts of our life, it's so important. So I'm exploring that now.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story about where your grandfather was to be--I mean your great-grandfather was to be related to Sitting Bull? Now, Sitting Bull traveled the country with the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Before that, he was mostly out in South Dakota in the Badlands--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the western South Dakota.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--but he did tour after the U.S. Army, you know, conquered the LaKotas. He toured the country with the Wild West Show. He even went to Europe, to Britain and--.
Speaker 2: Yeah. But he might have spent some time in Point South, right?
Speaker 1: He might have spent time in Cincinnati [Ohio], I mean, or in South--you're right.  You're right.
Speaker 2: Yeah. It's Point South.
Speaker 1: It could be anywhere, but (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Kentucky. The Florida Panhandle.
Speaker 1: I just wonder if there's a story associated with where--
Speaker 2: No, I don't know that yet.
Speaker 1: --your ancestors may have encountered him.
Speaker 2: I don't know that yet, but I am exploring that. We're all exploring that, because my sister, Sherry, is also the house--the family historian. She's helping me put that together.
Speaker 1: It's the kind of thing on the surface people might think, "Oh, that couldn't be." But then, again, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: There're a lot of ways, I mean, there're buffalo soldiers out in South Dakota.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And, I mean, a lot of, you know, so black families move around.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Black people move around, so we don't know.
Speaker 2: I have found out in tracing our history, Sarah Vaughn is a cousin of one of my aunts on her mother's side. No. It's on--actually, she's the cousin of my aunt on my father's side. And so, I have quite a bit of her music and can see a tie to that. And my cousin, Ralph, was a--he--these were all who have passed--he was a producer who helped Maurice White establish their records, records for Earth, Wind, and Fire.
Speaker 1: Okay. So he produced--what's Cousin Arnold's last name?
Speaker 2: Ralph Bates. He was the son of Mary Bates, which is my aunt, Mary. And she had a daughter, Linda Bates, which was a very, very prominent diversity enhancement and workforce development czar and advocate at the University of Cincinnati, a long-standing career there, of extraordinary service, person services in Cincinnati. When she passed, she had 400, 500 people at her funeral. It was just--
Speaker 1: What was her name again?
Speaker 2: Linda Bates.
Speaker 1: Linda Bates.
Speaker 2: Yeah. She's done quite a bit of work on diversity particularly for black women, career opportunities for black women at a time when women were just having an opportunity to be able to work and have equal pay. And then she helped get my mom in UC [University of Cincinnati], and then allowed her to be a working mom as well after her and my father [Oliver George McGee, Sr.] divorced.
Story_ID: 626168
Speaker 1: Well--so your father [Oliver George McGee, Jr.], he finished high school in Cincinnati [Ohio], too, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: He went to which one?
Speaker 2: Cincinnati Woodward.
Speaker 1: Okay. Woodward High School.
Speaker 2: That is the oldest public high school west of the colonies. West of the Appalachians. And it's quite natural, you know, Cincinnati is one of the oldest cities west of the colonies. If you went west when you're in the colonies, you were going to Cincinnati. And the oldest public high school at that time was established by William Woodward at about 1820s, the 1820s. And then that led to the Cincinnati College, which then led to the University of Cincinnati. William Woodward placed an endowment through the city of Cincinnati and the Sycamore Street Building and built the Sycamore Street Building since I work with Downtown. And that beget the Woodward High School, and it beget the Cincinnati College and the University of Cincinnati. I know this because I am researching the history of Woodward and the history of Woodward High School, because I would like to just write a graduate story, a folksy story about what Woodward has meant to me insofar as developing me into the person I am.
Speaker 1: The high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the high school.
Speaker 1: Okay. Alright.
Speaker 2: The oldest public high school east of the colonies. I am very, very proud of that.
Speaker 1: West of the colonies.
Speaker 2: I mean west of the colonies. I knew I was going to say that (laughs).
Speaker 1: Now, so, Woodward High School is named for the same Woodward that the street is named for in Detroit?
Speaker 2: It's named by the founder, William Woodward.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's named after that.
Speaker 1: I wondered because, you know, Detroit [Michigan] is a straight up, natural Indian trail, right up--from Cincinnati to Detroit?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Which is now I-75?
Speaker 2: That's right. That's right. That's right.
Speaker 1: It's a 300-mile trip, but it's one that was made all the time by the Indians back in the day.
Speaker 2: That's right. Straight up.
Speaker 1: I just wondered if Woodward, you know, once he (unclear) with Cincinnati went straight up to Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 2: Well, I don't see that in the history books just yet. But, the definitive resources I have, this--he was a man that was dedicated to providing public education for those who did not have access to any education at all. And he made his gift to the city in order to provide the first public form of education in the United States. And that was, at least, west of the colonies. And that was a very, very wonderful historical gift that was given to the city of Cincinnati, and led to the, you know, in the formation of the University of Cincinnati Endowment, which is really one of the oldest endowments in the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm rather proud of that as an alumnus.
Story_ID: 626169
Speaker 1: Alright, now. Is there a--now, what is the story about how your parents [Jean Arnold and Oliver George McGee, Jr.] met? How does that go?
Speaker 2: They met at a high school dance held by graduates of Cincinnati Hughes, and my dad was across the room and eyed my mom, who was extremely shy. And he walked over to her and ran his talk to her, and winded up taking her home after many suitors were unsuccessful. And they dated several times, and then I came along. And I was a kid around seven or eight, and I remember asking my mom, I said, "Hi, mom. My birthday is in October and you guys were married in May. And I found out that that takes nine months to make a baby, and I'm--that's five months." (laughs). So that was my first introduction to, "Let's sit down and have a birds and bees talk with you." And so, I was kind of a smart--because I could count. And so, my mom says, "You already can count. You always count the change." (laughs). And so, that was my first introduction to the birds and the bees, because we were trying to count why it's five--
Story_ID: 626170
Speaker 1: Okay. So, you're the oldest in the family, right?
Speaker 2: Yes. I'm the oldest of the Oliver and Gaean siblings. Maurice McGee, who is my cousin, is two years older than I was. And I consider him my family. He's my brother, I wrote. He was with us--
Speaker 1: Your--is he on the paternal side or maternal side?
Speaker 2: He's on my dad's side.
Speaker 1: Your father's side, okay.
Speaker 2: And my dad adopted him after his parents--his mother was actually, tragically shot--
Speaker 1: Right. I remember you telling me that.
Speaker 2: --by her boyfriend, and he witnessed it. And so, Maurice was my brother, and he was at the time seven years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he was going through some real trauma on that.
Speaker 1: So the official, it's you, then you've got a sister.
Speaker 2: Brenda.
Speaker 1: Brenda, who's the artist.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Then--
Speaker 2: Sherry.
Speaker 1: Sherry.
Speaker 2: She's the sales person.
Speaker 1: How do you spell her name?
Speaker 2: S-H-E-R-R-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay. Then it's Maurice.
Speaker 2: Maurice.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Marines. Maurice is the Marine.
Speaker 1: Oh, he's a Marine?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Oh, alright. Okay. Alright.
Speaker 2: And builder.
Speaker 1: Mm-hm.
Speaker 2: Construction builder.
Story_ID: 626171
Speaker 1: Now, when you consider your parents' personalities and dispositions, their talents, their hobbies, their looks, their interests, I mean, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I look like my father [Oliver George McGee, Jr.] and a mix of my mother [Jean Arnold], but I have my mother's personality.
Speaker 1: Okay. Alright, now. What aspects of her personality do you display?
Speaker 2: I am studied. I'm a bookworm. I analyze. I inherited her intuition. I can read people and have an intuition about them, feel them. And I have her political savvy. She is my mentor and she's--she was put into situations of survival and safety, and then perseverance, and then rebirth, and then emergence of success models that I--her and I have aligned ourselves with. And she helped me through higher education. She rose through the ranks of the University of Cincinnati [Ohio]. She started out as a secretary in a dormitory, Dabney Hall at Cincinnati. And she got there because Linda Bates was working in Cincinnati in the College of Business Employment Opportunity Office for students, and got her a job as a secretary in the dormitory at Dabney Hall, where she was raising us after my mom and dad got divorced. And she was a single mom, it was the first time she had a job, and she went from there and ended up as an Equal Opportunity Officer for the university, working for Joe Steger, who was the long-serving president of University of Cincinnati. So she's a rise-through-the-ranks, and from staff member to sitting and giving presentations to the University of Cincinnati Board, and presenting to Stan Chesley, who was on the board, and working with Tony [Anthony] Perzigian, who was a long-serving provost at University of Cincinnati, and presented to Joe Steger. And that's who I was raised and listening to all the stories and challenges she had as a university administrator. And she was working for promotion and tenured faculty at the university medical college. So she taught me how to go through promotion and tenure. And that helped, because I listened to her, and I as the first African-American to receive tenure at Ohio State University in the history of the college of engineering.
Speaker 1: Okay. So she set a pattern that you could emulate--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in terms of a lot of different areas.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Larry, I think you need that as--there's always when a young kid as I've seen and studied and mentored, and many of them I have, they always seem to have one or two parents that are drivers, that really keep them moving to achieve. And even if you look at the people that you've interviewed for this HistoryMakers, I'm pretty sure--and you were telling me that as we were getting coffee today, that there's always someone in there in the childhood in the first seven years, and then from seven to fourteen, that is a driving force in shaping who they are and then they hone it in and close it by time they're 14 to 21. And then after that, that's the first three-sevenths of your life defines (unclear) your life.
Story_ID: 626172
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, I do. I remember the pride I felt when my father [Oliver George McGee, Sr.] was named the first black fireman in the city of Cincinnati [Ohio]. When they wrote an article of him in the Cincinnati Enquirer, and he quoted us in that article. He said, and I'll show you the article; he said that I would be a doctor (laughs), when I was just a young kid. And I--it's really amazing how those articles can be almost foretelling because I'm a doctor now. I'm not a medical doctor, but I'm a doctor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was very proud of him on that, and I remember--
Speaker 1: Now, this is a story here, I suppose, too, because this--it's not easy to be a fireman in the first place. It's physically demanding.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You have to be strong and be able to, you know, endure a lot of physical training to be a fireman, and you have to, you know. But, and to be a black fireman, you know, you've got segregation to overcome.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, even in Cincinnati.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Which may come as a surprise to some who haven't been there, but (laughs), Cincinnati wasn't that much different from a lot of places in the South in those days.
Speaker 2: You have to really learn diversity in Cincinnati. Breakdowns in history walls. The one reason I love Cincinnati, they said the road to the White House is through Cincinnati. And the reason that is the case is because Cincinnati is about making history. It's a historical city in itself. If you are Cincinnatian, you are somehow making history because you're just part of that city. My father was taking the test at the time in the mid-'60s [1960s] to really get a full time job for the city. He took a test for the Cincinnati Water Works, and he wanted to be a labor man. And then he stepped up and took a test for becoming a police officer. So he wanted to become a police officer and he passed, but they chose the other person who was behind him, because they didn't really want to put him in front of that operation, and have a black man have a gun. So he--
Speaker 1: Now, were there any black police officers in Cincinnati when your father applied?
Speaker 2: I don't think so. Not at that particular time. Very, very few if any. But I know there weren't any black fireman in the whole city. And he was moved over, took the exam. To tie in to what my mother says is that, he was passed over for the police chief's son. And in exchange, his son tested below my father. He got the job. He got the position. And in exchange, my mom [Jean Arnold] convinced him, my dad, and convinced the police chief to send his application over to the fire department, for which they said, "Alright. We're going to test this one." And then they named him at the time, really trying to test (the value of the?) university and to make history, the first black fireman in the city of Cincinnati. But, interestingly enough, Larry, the Cincinnati Fire Department is one of the oldest fire departments in America. You know, behind the London [England] Fire Department, of course, and the New York Fire Department, and then the Boston [Massachusetts] Fire Department, then there's the Cincinnati Fire Department. So, ironically, my father made history becoming the first black fireman of the city of Cincinnati. That was a very pivotal moment in our family because we were instantly propelled to the black middle class. At the time, in order to do that you had to get a job with the city.
Speaker 1: Now, what year is this when your father--
Speaker 2: 1964, '65 [1965].
Story_ID: 626173
Speaker 1: And we were propelled to the black middle class, lower middle class, but we were there. And we were able to move to a larger home and, more importantly, to get to better schools, which was North Avondale Elementary, which was a--at that time, would be considered the chartered test school for Cincinnati [Ohio], feeding into Walnut Hills High School, and then on to college preparatory.
Speaker 2: Okay. So.
Speaker 1: The principal was Louise Resky (ph. splg.), my favorite teacher in North Avondale Elementary was Ms. Eva Mitchell in--
Speaker 2: Now, is this your first school, North Avondale?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: North Avondale?
Speaker 1: Yes, because--well--
Speaker 2: Did you go to kindergarten there?
Speaker 1: I didn't go to kindergarten there. I went to a city school. I can't remember that one. But I do--my real recollection was first, second grade in North Avondale.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And my third grade teacher was Ms. Louise--Ms. Eva Mitchell, and my fifth grade teacher was Ms. Louise Freeman. She was the first lady that recognized that I had an aptitude for math.
Speaker 2: Okay. Eva--
Speaker 1: Ms. Eva Mitchell.
Speaker 2: Mitchell.
Speaker 1: Mm-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The reason we grew very good friends because I used to stay after to help her plan her lessons for the next day, and I would erase her board and write her lesson plans on the blackboard for her after school, and she would keep me there until 4:30 or 5, and my mom [Jean Arnold] would allow me to do that because she wanted me to be near her. She was one of the finer teachers in the school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then Ms. Louis Freeman used to let me help plan the math lesson plans since she knew I had a skill in mathematics in fifth grade.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And she encouraged that.
Speaker 2: So this is 1962 or so?
Speaker 1: '64 [1964] or '65 [1965] onward.
Speaker 2: This is the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because I remember '64 [1964], '65 [1965] on through '68 [1968] being in that school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I took the test to be considered for Walnut Hills High School, which was the college preparatory exam, and I just missed that flunked that because I couldn't really read very well. I had trouble reading. I used to bring home D's in reading.
Speaker 2: Now, what was that because of? I mean, was there--what was the problem with that?"
Speaker 1: My mom attributed it to the fact that I was probably put into hallways too much when they were doing the reading circles (laughs).
Speaker 2: Now, you get in trouble a lot in school?
Speaker 1: I was frisky. My mom said I was frisky because I had already knew the lesson plans before I came, because she said I knew how to count and read when I was three. She has a story where she tells me she sent me to the store to do some shopping for her, and I went by myself. She would let me go around the corner to the store by myself at three years old. And I came home one day crying because I couldn't convince the storekeeper that he was cheating me and gave me the wrong change. And she walked me back to that store and she told the storekeeper, who was a white man in St. Bernard, that he can count. And he couldn't believe it. A three year old could count the change. And she said, "You give him the correct change." And she was pretty upset. And he went and gave me the correct change, and he was stunned that I was a three year old who could count Mama's change. And I was crying because I couldn't bring her back the correct change at three years old. So she said I knew how to read and count before I went to school. I just got slowed.
Speaker 2: Now, when you were--I don't know if you were big for your age or not, because you're what, at 6, 3 now?
Speaker 1: I was a little kid.
Speaker 2: So you're small growing up?
Speaker 1: Yes. I came into Ohio State University at 5, 10; 5, 11. And I grew to 6 foot 2, 6 foot 2 and a half, 4 years of college. And I'm now 6 foot 4, and I'm still growing.
Speaker 2: Really? Are you--?
Speaker 1: Mm-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's unusual.
Speaker 2: That's interesting.
Speaker 1: That's very unusual.
Speaker 2: Okay. I thought you were pretty--
Speaker 1: I was a late bloomer very, very much so, way beyond 17.
Story_ID: 626174
Speaker 1: In grade school, what was your favorite subject? Did you have a favorite subject--well, I guess math and--
Speaker 2: Math.
Speaker 1: Math.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Reading was my worst, which I find, Larry [Crowe, interviewer, The HistoryMakers], you're in a house full of books, and I could read pretty fast. And I consumed books and--but, when I was growing up, I could not read for the life of me. And I was so afraid to bring my report card home because the reading was just always a "D," and I'd get spankings for it.
Speaker 1: Did you need glasses or anything or did you--
Speaker 2: No. I just couldn't comprehend. I could not comprehend reading. My mom [Jean Arnold] finally fixed it. I had trouble speaking and I had trouble reading. I used to speak with a lisp. I spoke with a lisp, like that. And so she fixed--I'm almost doing it now (laughs). She fixed my S's, and she fixed me on how to read at the seventh grade before I went to junior high school. And that's when it kind of came on, the light came on, because in the eighth grade, my first book that I'd read I really enjoyed and could comprehend was a thick one. It was "David Copperfield." And that was the first book that told me about the excitement of reading, because--I still have the book in my house here, and I couldn't believe the stories of "David Copperfield," and so much was involved in that wonderful classic book. So, that was my first knowledge of understanding the power of reading.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember reading Vernon Jordan's book, "Vernon Can Read," and during that section when he's talking about all the things of him developing as a young black boy to really be taught to read, I think him and my brother were kind of bringing up the question that we have to have during education that time. What were we doing to young black kids, particularly young black man, in making sure that they were at the reading table. And if you can't read, how do you read "David Copperfield," one of the great literatures.
Speaker 1: What turned the light on?
Speaker 2: Technique. I went to summer reading, remedial summer courses, and that was a special attention on how to comprehend, how to read, and what--keep your mind from wandering so that you could comprehend the words off the page. Somehow, I just couldn't put that together when I was growing up at that time. And it's a technique that you learn, that I think kids learn very young when they're in charter schools, and when they're in special schools that help them do that. And that was the turning point. My mom put me in there. And then that went on to where I learned how to read music. And then I began to learn better the logic of math, and then I started just exploring the other skills of liberal arts, which is reading, writing, listening, and speaking. I'm still working on the listening. We always got to work on listening. But those skills: reading, writing, and listening and speaking, I think that I'm finding as we go into higher education now, that's the biggest challenge that we have. I'm looking into Stanford [University] and what they're doing in re-changing undergraduate education, and they've totally remapped their education for undergraduate there in thinking matters, and they're looking at how to look creatively and think creatively along these, start reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills, and thinking skills. And that's what I was learning in the early part of my life.
Story_ID: 626175
Speaker 1: What side of town did you live on?
Speaker 2: We had moved into North Avondale, which is a--largely, at the time, it was a Jewish community. Large homes are in Cincinnati [Ohio], North Avondale. Roselawn area, you can see some of the most beautiful old mansions of Old Cincinnati, and it was largely held by the Jewish community there. And North Avondale was created through that, and, you know, they had, you know, charter schools, and then the special schools (unclear). Walnut Hills was right outside of that. It's all surrounding around the Hyde Park area and feeding into the University of Cincinnati, and gearing kids in education enterprise, and the cultural centers that go around the University of Cincinnati. And then that feeds into West End and you got Music Hall. And I remember being near Eric Koontz and the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, and I was in the Cincinnati Youth Symphony Orchestra; played the cello. And so, all of that, centers of culture that Cincinnatians get to enjoy and the history, I was part of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mom [Jean Arnold] pushed me into that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: My grandfather was a lover of classical music. So you've been to my house and you see I'm a lover of industrial art and audio files. And so, I have some of the great works of classical music and jazz. And he was a big collector and lover of that. And I just grew up watching him and admiring him, and always had pair of headphones listening to [Wolfgang Amadeus] Mozart or [Johannes] Brahms or [Johann Sebastian] Bach, and I was humming along with him because I was playing with the Cincinnati Youth Symphony Orchestra, and they just gave us the music that we had been playing for the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra.
Speaker 1: Cincinnati has been called by Howard Cosell, the "Rheinland of America," because of the heavy German influence. You got like a poor base economic, music--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --culture; a lot of cultural and musical things going on--art and new music, as well as the soap companies and the, you know, and other--.
Speaker 2: You've got Procter and Gamble [Cincinnati, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You've got Chili. You have Wiedemann Beer, Berger Beer, Barq's Soda; cream soda (laughs). You've got the wiener company there. I'm not sure. I don't think it's Oscar-Mayer, but it's the other wiener company. I forgot about that.
Speaker 1: There was a Koontz Wieners and--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I know we had--.
Speaker 2: Kahn's Wieners.
Speaker 1: Kahn's. That's right. It's Kahn's. Right.
Speaker 2: Yes. Because they used to talk about it by the classic Al Schottelkotte.
Speaker 1: Al Schottelkotte. That's right.
Speaker 2: Yes. I used to--I lived--WCPO-TV, channel 9 with Al Schottelkotte.
Speaker 1: But--it's the only news that was actually named for the newscaster--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --that I know of in the United States.
Speaker 2: CPS Affiliate. Yep.
Speaker 1: The Al Schottelkotte News, they called it.
Speaker 2: Yes. Al--the Al Schottelkotte News, which, I believe beget the Walter--CBS News Evening News, Walter Cronkite and then Dan Rather. You know, when you put those named personalities out there, they all say if you can't sell it in Ohio, Columbus, Cincinnati, Cleveland, you can't sell it to America. I mean, McDonald's, I grew up working at McDonald's flipping hamburgers. That's my first basic job. And McDonald's used to test their product in Columbus, Ohio; Cincinnati. If it tastes good to Ohio, it tastes to good to America. You look at the election today. What is it about? It's about Ohio and Florida. You can't sell it in Ohio, you're not going to get into the White House. And I learned from Bill Clinton, the road to the White House is through Cincinnati.
Story_ID: 626176
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: In Cincinnati [Ohio]? I remember Coney Island. I remember being afraid of the very--that rollercoaster. I thought it was--. Now when I look at it, it seems like a baby coaster. But I was very afraid of that coaster. And now I love rollercoasters. I dive off of Cedar Point (laughs). That's one of my favorite parks now, and that's 415 feet high, but I couldn't do that style. But now I see children, and they're diving off the thing (laughs).
Speaker 1: Coney Island is an amusement park in Cincinnati, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah. It was a very--one of the earlier ones. It was the very--one of the earlier ones in Midwest and nationally. And then it beget Kings Island. I remember the Cincinnati Farmer's Market. My grandfather, Geane Oliver, who every time he came down from New York, we always went out for an outing to the Cincinnati Farmer's Market. And I remember getting the bags of fruit, and grapes, and peaches, and apples, and bananas, and--I was a hungry kid. This tall, and skinny, and narrow--. And I ate like a horse. And my mom took me to (the hospital?) and wanted to find out if I had a tapeworm in me. And I couldn't pick up a pound whatsoever. Today, I'm kind of happy about that because I'm not too heavy, but I as a kind of--I was a skinny kid, but I ate like everything. And so, I used to love to go and see the smells and flavors of Farmer's Market in Cincinnati. Cincinnati is like a quiet, old New York. It has a strong flavor--. Oh, I remember a smell I used to enjoy. Ivorydale [Technical Center] on Vine Street. I used to love to go on the tours of Ivorydale.
Speaker 1: Now, what is Ivorydale?
Speaker 2: That is Procter and Gamble [Cincinnati, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If you were a kid in elementary school or a junior high school, you enjoyed a tour of Ivorydale. That was just--my first experience of industrial policy. But, for Procter and Gamble being one of the oldest companies in America, in Cincinnati it was just--it was like a country store on the other side of town. You would've never knew that. And then, eventually, my life let me to my--one of my mentors, the late LaVelle Bond, who was vice president for diversity worldwide. And he was one of the first five African-Americans brought in to Procter and Gamble at the time. They called themselves the "Raggedy Five." And the reason they were called the "Raggedy Five," because they were trying to test the value of diversity at Procter and Gamble and see who would rise to the top and persistence in career advancement, and Lavelle was the only and one of the "Raggedy Five" that made it to the top as vice president for diversity worldwide, working for the great John Pepper, who went on to create the MLK Underground Railroad Exhibit in Cincinnati. I met John Pepper at LaVelle's retirement, and shortly after that he passed, and I miss him greatly. LaVelle was a phenomenally great mentor. You know, Larry, the best relationship one has in life is the mentor-mentee relationship. That's the one best thing you have in life. You have to be both a mentor and a mentee, because you both keep each other safe from more hazard. And LaVelle and his counsel, his thoughtfulness, often kept me for more hazard. So did Dr. Julian Earls, who asked me--ordered me, to get a doctorate.
Story_ID: 626177
Speaker 1: How were your grades in grade school?
Speaker 2: Say that again?
Speaker 1: How were your grades? You say you struggled in reading, but you excelled in math.
Speaker 2: Good grades. There were B's, C's, D's in reading; but the other one for B's and C's, a few A's every once in a while. I wasn't the person with the straight A's and constantly excelling. I think the reading was stopping me for a moment. And I was a creative kid. I was a mind-explorer kid. Not a wanderer, not a daydreamer, but just a curious kid. Very curious. Curious about nature, birds, plants, you know. Just really kind of exploring sounds. I think it was all basically feeding into what my life is right now, which is highly curious, creative, and I'm always a constant learner.
Story_ID: 626178
Speaker 1: Now, did the river play any role in growing up in terms of-Cincinnati [Ohio] is right on the Ohio River.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: It's a big scenic kind of a, you know, town.
Speaker 2: I don't know how to swim, Larry. So I don't think I went down to the river often (laughs). I just never really learned how to swim. So--
Speaker 1: They've got the hills. I was just there Sunday at an art museum.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the hills, and the--it's a
Speaker 2: It's a beautiful--it's a beautiful river, and it's an historical river. I think my experience with the river was really the reading it and learning it from the history of the city. But not really wading in it (laughs).
Speaker 1: Alright. Okay. Not that it--what were race relations like in Cincinnati growing up? Now, you were a little kid when the Civil Rights Movement was reaching a crescendo, I guess, with the signing of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 and all that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Your father [Oliver George McGee, Sr.] at that time makes a move in Cincinnati by becoming the first black fireman. I'm sure there were a lot of other firsts--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --happening.
Speaker 2: Race relations, I remember growing up, was tense. And my father and my mother [Jean Arnold] were having discussions that I could hear, and many I'm positive, were offline for me, where they were facing the tensions of how to be a black man and succeeding, and getting the job, and raising money for the family, and my mother pushing him behind the scenes to be more out there and more outgoing. They were a common team in that fashion when they were together. But I also think, Larry, that it added tension to their relationship where that eventually the marriage failed. And it was--it was tough.
Story_ID: 626179
Speaker 1: That would be about 1970.
Speaker 2: What I was sharing with you, Larry, I think when children are raised in a family with a mother and a father, and we were traumatized because my father's mother passed, and when the father loses his mother, and we've seen this in leadership models as well, you know. I've observed that when I was watching from afar, Bill Clinton, when he lost his mother, a man loses his way when he loses his mother. And with the tensions that were going on this city, for a black man to succeed with ambition built in, because I have ambition because I inherited it from my father, the home gets tense; mother is saying, "Well, get on out there. Try to get this. Try to do that." She had once told me I wanted my father to go to the fire department, not the police department, because I didn't him want him to bring a gun home. That's something I learned later in life. That's important. So there was tension.
Speaker 1: So she wasn't--she wasn't satisfied with him just being a fireman. She wanted him to try to move up in the ranks or to do something else in city government or what?
Speaker 2: I think that they might have had tension where my mom was showing signs earlier on, she wanted to be a working lady at the time when it wasn't fashionable for women to be in the job force. It was just one breadwinner. And my dad probably had the tension of wanting him to continue to succeed, as any man does. Even when I feel that burning myself. But when you're going through, at that time, where there's tension, which I think most black men, at that time, were really going through, it can create tension at home. And it ended difficult. There was domestic violence at home. And I observed that. And as a young child, I think that taught me to how to seek safety and survival, and to be persistent, and quietly observe conflict and dodge it. And which, as I watch people in conflict resolution today, even in my jobs, I--you know, you can either go into the resistance or you can move away from resistance and then to still keep going, keep moving. And that's what I tend to do, because of that early challenge in our family. And it breaks up the whole family. I've had to make a decision when I was 13 who I wanted to live with: my mother or my father.
Speaker 1: Now, were you still at North Avondale then or were you in a middle school?
Speaker 2: I was in--just going into the seventh or eighth grade.
Speaker 1: So, did they have a middle school system or junior high school system?
Speaker 2: Middle school system.
Speaker 1: Okay. So was the name of the school different?
Speaker 2: Crest Hills Junior High.
Speaker 1: Crest Hills. Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I had elected to live with my father [Oliver George McGee, Sr.]--I like my father. He was fun, and construction worker combined with a fireman, you--a boy is going to look up to that. But I inherently felt a connection to my mother [Jean Arnold], and I felt safety with her as she was seeking safety and survival. And I admire her for going through that and in protecting the children.
Speaker 1: Okay. So--
Speaker 2: And keeping a household going. And so, she persuaded me because, she said, I would be the man of the house. And so, I stepped up to, early on at 13, to that responsibility to be the man of the house, because they, my two sisters came with me, Brenda and Sherry. But Maurice had to go with my dad because he was the--he was adopted by my dad. He was a ward of my dad. So I lost a brother, and then went to live with my sisters and my mother. I do have another brother who died at birth. And he was after my sister, Sherry. So I always have his spirit with me, and he has come back into my life through other forms in my life, through one of my best friends, who (unclear), yeah.
Story_ID: 626180
Speaker 1: Something I didn't ask you about. Two years earlier before your parents split up, Dr. King [Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --1968.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Now, were there riots in Cincinnati [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes. And I remember my dad [Oliver George McGee, Sr.] being angry about that, and my mom [Jean Arnold] as well. That has an impact in the family. That had an impact in black families, especially when you're seeing that so close to home. The cities like Detroit [Michigan], Washington, D.C., Cincinnati. The folks being upset about that. You cannot forget that in your life, and then you were discussing that social ill in the home. Thank God, Larry, that we are in America right now where that simply is not a solution. We find other was to debate and exchange and disagree, but we're not doing the assassinations of King and Kennedys and shooting Vernon Jordan's, and shooting, you know, Senator Kennedy and President [John F.] Kennedy's. We don't do that anymore. It's out of fashion. And, thank God, America has evolved from that.
Story_ID: 626181
Speaker 1: 1970, you're on the verge of starting high school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you started high school, what, in '71 [1971]?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yep.
Speaker 1: Now, when did your reading turn around?
Speaker 2: Probably eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So this is a big year for you, 13?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Your parents split, you're the man of the house.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Your reading finally kicks in.
Speaker 2: I'm thrust into Lazanville High School, so that I could go through a whole summer school of reading remedial classes. That was a big change. That was my mom [Jean Arnold] grabbing with tough discipline. She was a disciplinarian, the largest figure in my life that I remember, and the biggest thing I remember of her is her discipline. And to this day I always thank her for that, because can you imagine if she had a soft hand on me where I'd be? So, you know, you need that structure. And I have structure in my life right now. You're in my home. Does my home appear structured to you, Larry? It's structured. My home is the feel that you hear--that you feel here is exactly my mother's home. Everything is in its place. It's very neat. Even the folks in--down--the neighbors come in and say, "Wow, it's so organized in here." (laughs) But that's essentially what I learned from my mother. She brought structure after real turmoil.
Speaker 1: So she started to work too, I guess, around this time, is that it?
Speaker 2: Yes. She left 7:30 in the morning. I used to hear her. And--
Speaker 1: She was working at the University of Cincinnati?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we couldn't afford a house. We had to live--give up our house. And I never had a bedroom until I went to college after that. I slept on the couch.
Speaker 1: So you rented a house or apartment?
Speaker 2: Two-bedroom apartment. The bedroom went to the girls. My mom had her bedroom and I would see the women need their privacy. I was the man of the house, I slept on the couch, and I kept my stuff in the closet. So I learned how to make due like my mother. Safety and survival was the key, and hard work.
Story_ID: 626182
Speaker 1: Now, did your father [Oliver George McGee, Sr.] contribute to the household from where he was?
Speaker 2: No (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, this is (unclear) the case I think. This is before law--.
Speaker 2: Very little. I should say very little. He did, but very little.
Speaker 1: Were they officially divorced right away or--
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: --were they (apart?)?
Speaker 2: They had to really split because there was domestic violence and--.
Speaker 1: Okay. So--.
Speaker 2: And, you know, I witnessed that and that caused me to go in and curl in, and to be able to--. Larry, a young man who has to curl in and heal from that, and I'm very open with you on this right now because this is what life is about. Life is about going through challenges and then coming out the back end, and then rising like a phoenix, and then contributing, giving to the best of your ability. And then start all over again. Find the next student. Find the next opportunity. Find the next level of achievement. Because this is what we do in America. We compete and we achieve. And that's cyclical. Like the business cycles in America, there're the ebbs and flows, the ups and downs. And that's exactly what life is. And that is what science, engineering, mathematics is. You find an answer and then you go back and test your assumptions again, and then you have to go back and retune your model. And then you have to test your model. And then you have to come up with conclusions, and they may not be matching the appearances. And then you go back and start over again. Sometimes we lose patience in life because we're not willing to go back and retest your assumptions and start over again and keep trying. What I tell kids: keep trying. Science and technology is not a spectator course. It's a [reiteration?]. It's cyclical. It's going back and trying again, and again, and again. "The little train that could." And then pretty soon, people look at me and they say, "Whoa. Wow. Oliver, you've got to many achievements and accomplishments." First of all, I'm not paying attention to them, but then others notice it. And then I go back and stop for a moment and look at my life and say, "All I've been doing is "the little train that could," and kept trying over and over again. Much like in the story that you are peeling out of me, remarkably, I might say. If you're not careful, you're going to have an Oprah moment here (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay (laughs). That will be my first one I think.
Story_ID: 626183
Speaker 1: So you're a freshman in high school. You can read now that you're in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So did your grades, like, jump?
Speaker 2: They did. I met Ms. Anna Davis, and she introduced me to geometry and a ruler. I never saw a math teacher that could teach geometry and math so very, very well. Geometry and trigonometry and do it with a ruler. At that time, I guess, they could teach math with a ruler, but that was very effective, because I learned the rules of trigonometry and geometry. I know it right now. Two parallel lines cut by a transversal, the alternate interior angles are equal. That's one of Euclid' theorems in the "Book of Euclid." And I looked at that. I have "The Book of Euclid" here, and I looked at that and said, "That's Anna Davis with a ruler." (laughs). I didn't know she was teaching me one of the great quotes of the Western civilization and learned at the Aspen Institute, and that is Euclid's geometry. But I'm sure Euclid didn't teach his kids with a ruler. Ms. Anna Davis did. She did and God bless her, because I learned geometry and trigonometry.
Speaker 1: Now this is at Woodward High School?
Speaker 2: This was at Woodward High School. She had a very, very disciplined class. I remember her marching up and down and going through the Euclid geometry and those rules. And, boy, if you didn't, whack (laughs). To this day, it's --. Larry, do you know that one of the most phenomenal mathematical models, tools, techniques is actually geometry and analytic geometry. And if you can follow some of the great questions that we have in physics, and chemistry, and economics, and commerce simply through Euclid's geometry. I want the kids who see this to know that. Pick it up. Euclid's geometry is the path and diagrams of life. Just try not to have Anna Davis with a ruler (laughs).
Speaker 1: So the Euclidian geometry is key to, you say it's like acquiring a few other disciplines.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In higher math and science and even commerce.
Speaker 2: Yeah. It's one of the techniques of mathematical modeling which I specialize in. And it allows you to--when you look at--. What we have in our schools, if we want to instill stem education, is we want to teach kids how to think first about mathematical modeling as the gateway to understanding science. And that science is physics, chemistry, economics, psychology. If we know how to look at mathematical modeling, not just study the techniques, but how to look at math rather it's geometry or analytic geometry or theory of numbers, probability, statistics; we can really set up our own assumptions and our own models to come to conclusions of great science. And this is why I'm so fascinated with this time of the undergraduate reforms in education that's taking place at Stanford [University], because they're reinventing how we do undergraduate education in this country. And that's going to translate into what we're doing at Howard [University] and other schools around the country. It's really about how we're modeling the world. And we really should teach courses on mathematical modeling. We normally get an appreciation of the great works in mathematics; Newton's calculus to Newtonian calculus to Euclid's geometry. But we also see how those great mathematicians of [Joseph] Fourier and like [Gottfried Wilhelm von] Leibniz and how they developed these models to be able to look at the real world.
Story_ID: 626184
Speaker 1: Now, in high school, were you involved in any leadership roles? I mean, on student government or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was. I was vice president of my junior class. I was the drum major of the marching band for two years, the Woodward High School Bulldog Marching Band. Some of my high school classmates are FaceBook-ing me right now, and still probably say I was one of the best ever.
Speaker 1: Now, this is interesting. Now you're an imposing person when met. You're six four, as you said. A strong, healthy guy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm six, four at 235.
Speaker 1: You said that in high school you weren't much of a ballplayer.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I loved football. The coach would say, "Get off the field." (laughs). But I wanted to be on the field, so I went to the marching band (laughs). That's the way I get to the ballgames free.
Speaker 1: So, okay. So for some reason you just weren't a good athlete.
Speaker 2: I was skinny. I was skinny and small. And if I was playing football, they'd break me in two.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was limber and had a little bit of developing athleticism. So I tried out for drum major and actually won, and was kind of really self-teaching myself. Actually, I self-taught myself to be drum major of the marching bank, and got the style and had it for two years. And, Larry, guess what I did? When I went to Ohio State [University], they have this drum major there that has to spin this stick. I did not know how to do that. So I found myself repeating life. You know how you have to repeat cycles in your life? I had to self-teach myself how to spin that stick. And I got with a teacher named D. Felves (ph. splg.) and I was working behind one of the greatest drum majors, I believe, in college football history, which was Dwight Hudson, who was the Archie Griffin of drum majors of Ohio State. And you Google, you can see his performances. I was right behind him as an understudy, and I learned from him. I had to re-teach myself to do that. I lost behind him three, four times, and made it my senior year the fifth time after he had decided to retire.
Story_ID: 626185
Speaker 1: So high school. So you're a drum major and--does Woodward [High School] have a decent band?
Speaker 2: Yes. We were with--it was--the director was Daniel Rumor, and he came in from Walnut Hills. No. He came in from another school, then he went to Walnut Hills. But he was--and then it was taken over by William Turner. The late William Turner. And we were a jazzy, a Grambling-style, Florida A&M [University]-style band. It was the Howard University band was very representative of what we were. And--
Speaker 1: Now this is the fast-march style, which is--
Speaker 2: Yes. Very much like that.
Speaker 1: --made popular by--what's his name? Foster. Dr. Foster at Florida A&M, right?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes. And I remember watching them or what I could see from them, and when I see the Howard University Marching Band today, it reminds me of the Woodward High School Bulldog Band. And I'm a big fan of Howard University's marching band. I just saw the nation's football classic on television, and they look really, really good. And the drum major there is very--they're good right now. I enjoyed them on television. And Howard won. They beat Morehouse [College] by one point (laughs). That was a thriller. The lead changed hands seven times. I was thrilled at that game. It was a--I turned up all the big game--Michigan, Ohio State [University]. Everybody say, "You're not watching Michigan and Ohio State?" "No. I'm watching Howard and Morehouse. That's some history here." (laughs). And it was a good game.
Speaker 1: But you played--in the wintertime you play cello, right, in the--
Speaker 2: Yes. Yep.
Speaker 1: --orchestra?
Speaker 2: Yep. And I was practicing through the rehearsals during the fall as well. We used to go to the University of Cincinnati and the College of Conservatory of Music, and we practiced on Saturday morning and then I did the football games on Friday night. Most people in the Cincinnati Youth Symphony were doing that.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Cincinnati Conservatory is another legendary kind of (unclear).
Speaker 2: And that changed my life. That changed my life. I could hear some of the great operas. I first saw "The Marriage of Figaro" at the College of Conservatory of Music. I got a free ticket in there and saw "The Marriage of Figaro" by Mozart at the College of Conservatory of Music. And I think I said that right, "The Marriage of Figaro," right? That was my first opera. And we were in the College of Conservatory room and we played some of the great works: [Nikolai] Rimsky-Korsakov, [Pyotr Ilyich] Tchaikovsky, [Johannes] Brahms, [Johann Sebastian] Bach, [Wolfgang Amadeus] Mozart. All the ones that I have in the other room, it's just--. Those are great books of the Western civilization. You can read a book or you could hear a classical piece of work. And I used to walk around humming them.
Speaker 1: Now, the other end of this--I mean, on the other end of the music spectrum, Cincinnati is starting to become one of the funk centers of the country with--King Records is in Cincinnati where James Brown recorded, right.
Speaker 2: Yep. I saw James Brown in Music Hall live do all of the splits. Yeah. And that was our Apollo. That was our Apollo. And he was there. I saw the Supremes there. I saw Elvis [Presley] there. I saw the Temptations there. Yep. I saw the Temptations there. Yes, the Temptations.
Speaker 1: Now, I think like the--in some time in the early '70s [1970s], most of the members of the James Brown Band or a significant number of them were from Cincinnati.
Speaker 2: Yep. Yep.
Speaker 1: There was Bootsy Collins.
Speaker 2: Yep. Bootsy Collins.
Speaker 1: And his brother, Catfish.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. Yeah. And they came out of Dayton [Ohio] too. The Ohio Players.
Speaker 1: (unclear). Six, seven bands coming out of there. Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah. The Ohio Players.
Speaker 1: Wilson Pickett was playing in Dayton.
Speaker 2: Yep. And Teddy Pendergrass was coming out of there too. He was at least running through there. Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes. I even remember in high school that we were influenced by the Ohio Players out of Dayton, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Ohio Players, Lakeside, Slave, (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes. Yeah. My high school classmates were Tootie Calloway and Reggie Calloway, and they created "Midnight Star." I was in the marching band with them (laughs). They were very talented arrangers. Reggie was a gifted trumpet player, Reggie Calloway. And Tootie was a gifted arranger. So we were not surprised to see them as Midnight Star. And I--my friends were all sending me the stuff from Facebook right now, and I tune in on my phone and listen to some of the great hits that they had. And Cincinnati was a--. It was at that time when I was growing up, I would probably say it had the energy that later down the line TLC and LaFace Records was having in Atlanta [Georgia]. That's when it shifted to that, and then you had TLC, which is probably arguably one of the finest women bands or groups ever at that--. The album they had--I just got--I've got several--I've got the greatest hits and I just simply just love them, you know.
Story_ID: 626186
Speaker 1: Now, who were your science teachers that influenced you the most or any kind of teachers too, but I know you're starting to become focused on science at this point, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: So who were those sort of teachers?
Speaker 2: I think--my invitation to science was through math. So Mrs. Louis Freeman was the one that opened the door for me. Yeah. Because science didn't come to me through influence until I got into college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I came through--and then there was Anna Davis, who was instilling upon me the importance of math. And I was one of those kids at Woodward [High School] that took all the math courses up to trigonometry. We did not have a calculus course offered in my school, so I couldn't take calculus. But I took algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. And through those--and carried through those ranks with Anna Davis and her ruler (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay. So you're set for science after taking trigonometry. I know we were told about a month ago by someone that if you don't take calculus in high school, the train has left the station in terms of math--I mean, science, later on.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I think the real key is you have to cross over from geometry to trigonometry, because once you get the trigonometry, you know how to graph; you know how to look at the number line, you get to understand what minus infinity and plus infinity is, and what finite ranges from A to B are. And then you get to look at inequalities and how to do the algebraic manipulation of that, because no matter how far you go up the mathematical tree into real analysis or functional analysis, you ultimately had to bring down the parts of differential equations to an ordinary differential equation, and from ordinary differential equation to an algebraic set of equations. And then you're back at algebra. And that usually is involving some form of trigonometry as well. So, if you have to take the basics of math to be able to engage science and technology, you should take algebra. And the kids should take a geometry course and a very good trigonometry course. Because what happen--we didn't have calculus at Woodward when I was coming through. So, when I came to Ohio State [University] and I had to take the math test for the very first day of orientation, I really had to know that trigonometry to be able to get to calculus. And I didn't place in calculus my first year at Ohio State. I placed in what? Trigonometry. I was really upset. I wanted to jump right in to calculus. And I thank God I didn't because it helped me to reinforce my skills in trigonometry.
Story_ID: 626187
Speaker 1: Did you graduate with any sort of honors or anything?
Speaker 2: I was in the top ten percent of my class.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we had a class of about 475. I graduate at the top ten percent of my class, and that helped me to get into Ohio State.
Speaker 1: Now was--. I didn't ask you this, but I was assuming in my mind that Woodward [High School]was predominantly black.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But was it (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah. It was predominantly black. We probably were at probably '73 [1973]. And I graduated from Woodward just before it turned, before they just simply started doing ed-cities and shipping out to suburbs, and shifting the taxes from out there. And the public education system went to the suburbs. And city schools were just sort of left the new tax policy in education. So I graduated before--my mom [Jean Arnold] would say "You graduated just in time before it turned." And we all did, all the kids in our family. My sisters as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was about the late--mid to late '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Okay. This is about--
Speaker 2: And then--
Speaker 1: --'70 [1970]. You came out in--
Speaker 2: '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: --say what, '75 [1975]?
Speaker 2: Yeah. So when you go into the mid '80s [1980s] and the '90s [1990s], that's, you know, they had to go back and rehabilitate public schools in the country. (Sounds of sirens).
Story_ID: 626188
Speaker 1: Okay 1975, now this is your--getting ready to graduate from high school, and you're in the top ten percent of the class. Now, what are your aspirations or what kind of counseling did you get?
Speaker 2: I had pretty good counseling at Woodward High School. I'm not for sure it was really driving me towards college. It was--
Speaker 1: What do you--now, wait a minute now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You're in the top ten percent of the class.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And a counselor would--I mean, the counselors are not pushing you towards college?
Speaker 2: I don't ever remember having any conversation about college with a guidance counselor. I don't remember that, and I'm sure I'm not forgetting that. I had to figure my way through college, like most of my life, on my own. I started out, Larry, with life self-teaching myself; treading through the unknown, figuring it out, how to do it. I had to deliberately self-teach myself how to play the cello.
Speaker 1: Now see, this is not--you're not alone in the sense that, you know, I have so many bad counselor stories from "I don't know who your counselor was," but these days--
Speaker 2: I don't think they were bad, because they taught me to take trigonometry and they allowed me to go in and fill in for--I'm taking physics, taking chemistry. I took the college preparatory tracks, so I think they're doing a great job on that. But we never sat down and said, "MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] is possible for you. Did you ever think about putting in an application for MIT?" "Well." "Well, you may not make it but, you know, maybe there's Affirmative Action. Let's give it a shot." "They might have taken me with a college preparatory, you're a good kid." Who knows? That wasn't presented to me. "Maybe Ohio State [University]."
Speaker 1: Now that's something that you would do in that job, right? For someone?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Right now I'm talking to kids. I'm getting them NSF [National Science Foundation] graduate student fellowships and I'm talking to them about how to go to college.
Speaker 1: Can you think of any reason why a counselor would not do that for you in high school?
Speaker 2: At the time--at the time, Larry, I never thought about it. But when I look back on it, I just don't think it was important to ask. It wasn't a national issue as it is now. At the time, we were still working on the model is, a young black kid, get a high school education for--if not, if it's not just the black kid; all kids. Because we're at the compulsory level with this country at that time, a high school education, then go out and get a job; a manufacturing job, an industrial job. Jobs are plentiful. Just know how to count, how to read, how to, you know, to speak, and how to do some basic writing to just be able to hold down a job and provide for your family. College? Right now, 15 percent of the kids go to college Ohio today. What about the 85 percent? At that time, we were good getting 85 percent to graduate from high school. Now are we doing that well? Five out of ten African-American kids like me don't even see diploma day. At the time, my counselors were just saying, "Get your degree." I mean, "Get your diploma and stay safe." And a time it was. You could go to Swinfen Shopping Center and do some shopping or go to a party and a dance, and didn't have to come out and run out for your life. But now, it's a whole different story for young kids. And going in to the next generation and generation after next, I wrote in my book about on getting to 2076, America's third centennial. And the big challenge is that the next generation and the generation after next, what are we doing in education policy in this country? That's a good question. What are guidance counselors saying to kids today?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Well, I still think there may be some other reasons for, you know, counselors not--that they might not even be aware of,
Speaker 2: And it could have been at the time that they weren't really thinking about the issues that we're thinking about now: looking at a young black child, particularly a black male, and seeing productive power, which is knowledge, possibilities, possibility thinking, potential. How do you tap into that, and what do you have to do the preparatory cycles to do that? Education wasn't a start-at-five-year-old process. It was a tracing through, working through, keep going in the right directions process. But it wasn't, "Let's introduce you to Dante at seven." I got David Copperfield at 13. So, many of the school kids who were getting prepared for MIT at that time, got it much earlier than 13. They were talking about it in the fifth and sixth grade.
Story_ID: 626189
Speaker 1: So at the time of graduation, did you have any idea about going to college at all? Did you think you would just go work for P and--Procter and Gamble [Cincinnati, Ohio] or what?
Speaker 2: I had a job just after 15, the moment I turned 16. My very first job. I started three weeks before my birthday. I just couldn't wait until my birthday to get my work permit card so that I could go to Mike Star, the manager of McDonald's on Redding Road, and start at QLC and flipping hamburgers at a very young, less than 15 years old McDonald's. If you asked me earlier what were the smells in my neighborhood, that was McDonald's. I started just at 16, and I stayed there well until I was 21, 22; right when I became drum major of the marching band at Ohio State [University]. So, at 16 and working through 17, my mom [Jean Arnold] had to claw me out of McDonald's because I wanted to have a career as a manager and own my McDonald's one day. And then I had a discussion with mother and she said, "You are not gonna go and become no manager at McDonald's. I brought you in this world, I'll take you out. You're going to college." (laughs). She was not going to have me do that, not at all.
Speaker 1: So this is when you're a senior your mother told you you're definitely going to college?
Speaker 2: "You are not going," she said, "You are not going to have a career at McDonald's. You are going to college."
Story_ID: 626190
Speaker 1: At the time, the plan was to go to the University of Cincinnati because she [his mother, Jean Arnold] worked there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I had a four-year part--she was part of the staff--four-year, you know, potential free ride. And then we were all set. With her gone--not have a college bill, and then I turned on the television one day and saw the Ohio State-Michigan game, and it was all over. I saw Archie Griffin, you know, working on his 100 yards. The Ohio State-Michigan game was on television and I saw the band do the script "Ohio.", and then I saw this man in a red coat--and I was drum major of the marching band in high school, and I couldn't believe that formation the incomparable script "Ohio" on national television. I said, "I'm going to be that man in the red coat." Walked in the kitchen, said, "Mom, I'm going to Ohio State because I want to be the man in the red coat." She said, "Go in there and sit down. You're crazy." And I came back and a few minutes later and said, "Mom, I want to go to Ohio State and be the man in the red coat." She said, "The only way you're going to go to Ohio State is if you can figure out how to pay for it." Now, most mothers would think discussion's over. "We're done." Remember, Larry, I'm persistent. I went on and did the research and came back with a proposal (laughs) about how I was going to pay for it. At the time, we had the former Pell Grant, the BEOG [Basic Educational Opportunity Grant], three-quarters of education; the OIG, the Ohio Instructional Grant I'd did the research and grabbed all that. College-work studies, and I came there with a package where I had at least probably 85 percent of it paid for all through financial aid. We're going through the time, the late, mid '70s [1970s], there's Ford--time, Ford, during President Ford years.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's--yeah, this would have been Gerald Ford, right.
Speaker 1: Second.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this would have been (unclear) or Ford. Right.
Speaker 1: Second one. Yeah. So all of these were opportunities and education policy available for financial aid, and I put together that package. And she relented and let me do it. I had--she said, "Now, you got to go get accepted." (laughs). So she kept putting the constructs in there. I came back and got accepted for Ohio State. I took the ACE--AC, what is called the--
Speaker 2: ACT?
Speaker 1: ACT, exactly. Yeah. Did horrible.
Speaker 2: What did you score on the ACT? Did you know that?
Speaker 1: And I'm so proud to say this, because my score was a horrible composite 17.
Speaker 2: I've heard worse.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I've heard a lot worse, but you had--
Speaker 1: I admitted--I've sat on the faculty committee of admissions for Ohio State, and I remember we were admitting Ted Ginn and other football players at Ohio State, and my scores are right there and, boy, I was defending them to the mind on that committee. Because I--those tests were just--oh, I couldn't figure those suckers out. But my math was a 26, 27. That was probably the potential there, because I was still good in math. I could read, I just couldn't read that fast. That's the key. You got to read fast to take those exams.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're timed has your name on it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're timed. I'm analyzing and still trying to get what the question is. And so, but the math, I could compute that fast, right? So I took my ACT to Ohio State [University], and at the time, they were pretty judicious didn't have selected admissions, and so they let a lot of us in, and I was one of the few African-Americans that got in, because there weren't many African-Americans that were admitted to Ohio State during the time. Frank Hale was at Ohio State working on diversity, trying to make sure that Ohio State let some of us in.
Speaker 2: You know, Dr. Frank Hale is legendary in (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Oh, he's a piece of--
Speaker 2: One of the African-American leaders in Ohio.
Speaker 1: There are lot of African-Americans who just think of him as God. I remember to his retirement when he retired at Ohio State [University]--worked for Johnson. He worked for Johnson, and then Ed Jennings is really the key that got Frank Hale at Ohio State. And so, I owe my admittance to Ohio State to the policies that he was--educating a thoughtful precedent in Edward Jennings, and having admissions policy available for that. My friend, Larry C. Wright, and myself were one of the few African-Americans who were--ending up at graduation day with Dean Donald Glower, and Dean Minnie McGee, his assistant dean, Minnie McGee, at graduation day, graduating in 1981. But stepping back for a moment is an important story that involves Dean Minnie McGee, because when I finally got and drove at 17 to--from Cincinnati [Ohio] to Columbus, Ohio, and said bye to my mother [Jean Arnold], tears, she let me go very reluctantly, "Alright." You know, that's my first time on my own.
Story_ID: 626191
Speaker 1: I just wonder to, if--now, you were in a situation in high school where you were kind of living in kind of cramped quarters.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you were, you know, man of the house in situations. At graduation did you sort of want to leave home? Leave Cincinnati [Ohio] and go someplace else?
Speaker 2: I think indirectly that was a calling. Yeah. It was time for me to step out into the real world. And for the first time leave the womb. And my mom [Jean Arnold] struggled with that. Bless her heart.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, I thought so.
Speaker 2: And she still keeps a hold on me now (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm surprised she hasn't called right now.
Speaker 1: So this is fall 1975, you at the Ohio State University, as they say these days.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And I went there to major in music. I went to the orientation to major in music. Obviously, I was in the Cincinnati Youth Symphony Orchestra. I was in the marching band. I wanted to go and major in music and join the Ohio State Marching Band. This is the reason why I chose Ohio State, I wanted to become the drum major of the marching band. Now, I share that with you, Larry, because kids oftentimes make decisions in college for very personal, different motivations. It's not always, pedagogical in terms of "I want to major in this." A lot of times, most of the kids come to college, they don't know what they want to major in. And I didn't know. I met Minnie McGee, and she got my attention because her name was Minnie M. McGee. MMM. And I said, "Your name is McGee." And people thought she was my sister. And she sat down and was there at the orientation talking to us, and she was looking for black kids to recruit to engineering, and she saw one of the few me's sitting in this little room, maybe in the corner, and a group, by myself. Most people weren't going towards engineering. I was sitting there for some reason. And she asked me, "What do you want to major in?" I said, "I want to major in music. I want to, you know, play the cello, and I want to become the drum major at Ohio State Marching Band." And she said, "I'll make a deal with you. If you come and major in engineering, we'll work and still make sure that you get to be drum major of the marching band. We got a deal?" And I said, "Sure." I said, "Why do you want me in engineering?" She said, "Your math scores. You had 26 in ACT. We want you in engineering."
Speaker 1: So this is the first real counseling you've ever received in terms of academics.
Speaker 2: Minnie McGee is the first real counseling. First real counselor I got in education outside of my mother. I naturally said "Sure." I went there. I said, "Alright." The deal make--the thing that cut the deal was I could still become drum major of the marching band (laughs).
Story_ID: 626192
Speaker 1: Now times of being the drum major--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --were not the styles of marching drastically different. Ohio State [University] is the slow, kind of a swing, you know, striding marching band, from what I could see. Now, we would--it was described to us when I was in high school. It was the model for our high school band, which is a strolling, you know, marching kind of German-style band.
Speaker 2: Ohio State is built of the church of England's--small English towns had military bands to play loud, brassy music to protest the church of England. The thought was, these brass bands, brass and percussion, formed in English towns which had all these castles of old churches, the church of England, they would play hymnals, brass hymnals loud in the town as a sort of accountability in a protest to the church of England for change in progression and, you know, challenging traditions of the traditional core of music. So, marching through the town in festivals, marching band brass festivals, was the key. Ohio State University is built off of that model. And I learned that from one of my other distinguished professors I met at Ohio State, which was Dr. Paul Drosick. He is an internationally renowned respected brassologist. The international brass band expert. And he happened to take me on a tour of England in 2007, and he took an American brass band to participate in those festivals. And he wanted to test the brass band model there because, typically, it's a conductor in front of the band as he goes through the town. They rarely have a drum major. And Ohio State styled, spinning the baton, drum major. I was an English experiment in this festival that had a hundred thousand people in it, and more than 100 brass bands.
Speaker 1: Now what year is this again?
Speaker 2: 2007.
Speaker 1: 2007? So this is many years after Ohio?
Speaker 2: Yes. And that's how I learned the history of how Ohio State has, and it is, the only brass and percussion--all brass and percussion band in the United States. And this was brought in by Eugene Weigel, on to Charlie Spawn, on to Jack Evans--it's Eugene Weigel and there's Jack Evans and then there's Charlie Spawn, and then Dr. Paul Drosick. And now it's John Woods and--Dr. John Woods, and doctor or John Waters.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that is the history of Ohio State. And so, my deal with Minnie McGee was to--as long as I could try out with the marching band and become the drum major, I could major engineering. I--the process of learning it--Ohio State taught me persistence, because I was trying out for drum major, I lost four times. Four years in a row. Now, along the way, Dwight Hudson came in, which was a very, very phenomenal drug major; been doing this since he was six years old. He was very seasoned, and he was the best performer, twirling performer in the world; seventh in the world. But he was the first African-American drum major in Ohio State's history. The history of drum majors at Ohio State, they've been place since 1921, and folks can see it at Ohiodrummajor.com. But they're about 70 of us or so, and half of us are still alive. And Dwight is arguably the best. And I was right behind him, so I learned very early on how to be an understudy. I oftentimes teased when I talked to him and said, "I was your Al Gore and you were my Bill Clinton." (laughs). So, I learned how to be an understudy, which I think is very important for a person to learn how to do in their life, to be an understudy, because you--it's quiet servant leadership. You learn a lot.
Story_ID: 626193
Speaker 1: So you got a chance to be drum major in your senior year, is that it?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My senior year. So I'm the longest ever serving assistant drum major of Ohio State history. Three years.
Speaker 1: From 1970 to--now, when you were at Ohio State [University], Ohio State was--the football team was--
Speaker 2: Phenomenal.
Speaker 1: Yeah. It was number one in the country most of the years.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. I went through the Woody Hayes years and the Earl Bruce years, and I went to, let's see, I went to the Orange Bowl, the Sugar Bowl, the Gator Bowl, the Rose Bowl, and the Fiesta Bowl while I was at Ohio State.
Speaker 1: How many times did Ohio State compete for the national championship when you were there?
Speaker 2: One time. That was at the Rose Bowl of 1979 against USC [University of Southern California].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did we win or?
Speaker 2: We lost by one point. It was a heartbreaker. Charles White, last minute and fifty seconds. But it was the thrill. It was my first time leading the marching band ever. I led through the seven and half-mile Rose Parade. So I was very satisfied, because I think a kid should grow up and just--if you ever have a kid that has a dream, grow up and lead a Rose Parade. That's a wonderful dream to have when you're 21 years old, and then have it happen. You're coming down the Colorado Boulevard, you say, "I was a little kid in North Avondale High School--I mean elementary school, and now I'm leading the Rose Bowl Parade, the granddaddy of all bowl games." It's amazing, and leading one of the best bands in the country, the college band for the country, right, at the Rose Bowl. And Dwight was resting because they have to rest the drum major, because right after Rose Bowl, which really, arguably, in another half hour, you have to do the game. And Dwight went on out and did his performance, absolutely stupendous as usual. And that was a wonderful, lovely experience in my life at college doing that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And next year I became drum major, and the second black drum major in the history of Ohio State and it's only been two of us. And after that, I graduated and got my degree from the College of Engineering.
Speaker 1: This is in 19--
Speaker 2: '81 [1981].
Speaker 1: 1981. Okay.
Speaker 2: That was a proud day. I actually got through engineering.
Story_ID: 626194
Speaker 1: How did you like engineering? Did you--were you glad that Minnie McGee recommended you to take engineering?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yeah. I really liked the department of civil engineering. We had absolutely extraordinary civil engineers in that department. T.Y. Chen, C. B. Smith is absolutely the best teacher that I have ever had in my entire life. Charles B. Smith. He got me a job with one of my great mentors, Harry B. Thomas; gave me my first real engineering job at [unclear] Stilson and Associates in Columbus, Ohio. And I learned how to look at drawings and look at buildings, and why they stand up and why they fall down; things that I research today. Harry had learned from Charles B. Smith, the great Charles B. Smith, because it's about meeting really good, distinguished teachers and professors. Rombere S. Sundu (ph. splg.) was the first professor, told me and my best friend, Larry C. Wright, who was also going through civil engineering along with me, my best friend to this day, and my mentor, Larry C. Wright. He told us both that we were young black engineers and we could do anything. Having him give us that affirmation on a daily basis was so powerful for both of us. You know, Larry went on to work at the McDouglas Helicopter. Not McDonnell Douglas. Then I went on to work for McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company, but we were building aerospace machines as a result of that, you know. Just good teachers, you know. There were phenomenal structural engineers. Keith Bedford, and Bob Sykes, and, you know.
Story_ID: 626195
Speaker 1: So, did you have a plan after graduation about what to do?
Speaker 2: I wanted to go on to graduate school, and I was encouraged by that by Rombere Sundu, and knew Richard H. Gallagher, who was the inventor of the finite element method. And he called him up and said, "Have I got a young man for you." He was, at the time, the dean of engineering at the University of Arizona. And he put me inside of a "NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] Glenn Research Center" or at that time it was called "NASA Lewis Research Center" computational structure apprenticeship. And it was in collaboration with the University of Arizona to work with Richard Gallagher, who was my master's thesis advisor. So I was learning from the father of the finite element method while doing practical work at the Glenn Research Center in Cleveland. And that is where I met Dr. Julian M. Earls.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The first black engineer I'd ever met.
Speaker 1: Now, in those days was Dr. Earls the head of the NASA?
Speaker 2: He was head of the safety branch.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a branch chief.
Speaker 1: This is what they call the "John Glenn Space Center" up in (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: It was called the--it was called "NASA Lewis Research Center."
Speaker 1: National. Okay.
Speaker 2: NASA Lewis.
Speaker 1: NASA Lewis Research.
Speaker 2: NASA Lewis Research Center.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In Cleveland, Ohio. And he was the head of the safety office at the time. But what made him so impactful, he was an amazing mentor and a national figure of encouraging kids at HBCUs, as well as kids of color from all walks of life, men and women, to take on technical careers. He was head of the National Technical Association. He introduced me to his daughter. He likes to call her Betty Borrow, and I'm called his son, and me and Betty became the best of friends, and she was working at NASA Glenn, the NASA Glenn Research Center. And Betty was a huge influence in my life, and Dr. Earls as well. And he just mentored us as if we were his own kids. And he told me, "You have no other choice. You're not going to get a bachelor's degree. You're going to go ahead and get a doctorate. That's an order." Like Minnie McGee, I followed his orders.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, you finished the master's at the University of Arizona and went on to--then to--
Speaker 2: The doctorate program at the University of Arizona.
Speaker 1: Doctorate. Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was working also at McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company at the same time, and then I came back to Ohio State as a senior research associate, finishing my doctorate. And I was working, at that time, with, not Dick Gallagher, but Arthur Leissa. I met Arthur Leissa at Ohio State, and I walked in his office one day and said, "You know what? I read your book, 'Vibration of Plates,' and the 'Vibration of Shells.'" If you look that up, those two classics are referenced by hundreds of people all over the world, particularly in the Orient; China, Japan, and I was really, really impressed with Arthur Leissa on how he could write. He could write tremendously. He taught me how to write. Another person who taught me to write while I was at Glenn Research Center was Bob Kielb. He's a professor at Duke University. He taught me how to research turbo machinery. He taught me how to--he hired me as a computational structures apprenticeship, and he taught me about aircraft engines. I was a civil engineer. And then we were working closely with Christian Caza (ph. splg.), who was one of the most outstanding air mathematicians in the world. He worked with the great Hope Ashley at Stanford. And I'm sitting working through air elasticity equations with Bob Kielb and Chris Caza at NASA Glenn Research Center while they were trying to stop engines from fluttering. It was phenomenal education. And they helped me to write a thesis and how to structure that, and to put together--Art Leissa taught me how to put together a technical paper. And my first paper that I published with Art Leissa was from my doctorate thesis and the journal sounded vibration, and the reason that we did that is that Art saw me write the draft of that paper, and he said, "You're beautiful writer, and I'm going to fine tune you." And he taught me the art of writing. To this day, I still write Art--like Art Leissa. I still write like Arthur Leissa.
Story_ID: 626196
Speaker 1: So, did you take time to savor your master's degree or did you just go straight through?
Speaker 2: I went straight through.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: A lot of scientists tell that story.
Speaker 2: Because--yeah. I guess Dr. [Julian Manly] Earls was kind of keeping me accountable. "Have you finished that dissertation yet?" You need somebody pushing you on that. And Arthur Leissa was a real inspiration on that, helping me to really write that first article.
Speaker 1: Now, that's your advisor, Art?
Speaker 2: Yes. He was one and so was Ralph M. Richard at that--at the University of Arizona.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)? How do you spell Art's name?
Speaker 2: L-E-I-S-S-A. Arthur W. Leissa. And Ralph M. Richard. They're both finite element guys.
Speaker 1: And--now, what was your--what was the title of your dissertation, and can you translate it for us too?
Speaker 2: I knew you were going to ask that (laughs). I think I remember. It's "Three Dimensional Elasticity-Based Solutions for Vibrations of Simultaneously Skewed and Twisted Parallelepipeds."
Speaker 1: And what does this mean in layman's terms?
Speaker 2: At the time, what we were doing is we were writing--it's applied mechanics, fundamental applied mechanics problems. And in 1988, we didn't have the advancements of large-scale computing or mathematical models available that were true enough to be able to look at fundamental problems of mechanics (coughing in background). And so, it was an outgrowth of Art Leissa's "Vibration of Plates and Vibrations of Shells." And we were beginning to look at--well, if you're looking at bodies that are plates that you see in planes or in buildings and slabs and so forth, they're ultimately just fundamental three-dimensional shapes, and they vibrate. Earthquakes to, if you look at any type of surfaces on an aircraft or even air--structures that are air-breathing propulsion systems, subject to instabilities of flutter and movement. They vibrate. They move. And we need to oftentimes know, first of all, the fundamental normal mode behavior before we can be able to put loads to be able to look at the force response. So at the time, when I was investigating with Dr. Leissa was, "Well, what is the fundamental continuum-based solutions to these types of fundamental vibration problems in three dimensions?" And our work was one of the very, very early ones in the field. Now, if you look at the literature, it is just enormous. It's huge. A lot of it is coming from the Orient and the Asian block. And just really great fundamental works of three-dimensional bodies. And Art has continued this work with a number of his students as well. And I'm doing some additional work into this as well still, and crafting a book on a three-dimensional vibrations of elastic bodies, just reviewing the literature, and having it close to the (treica?) of Art's "Vibration of Plates," "Vibration of Shells," and "Vibrations of Elastic Bodies." And that's what I'm preparing right now.
Speaker 1: Okay. So we're talking about plates, and you're talking about making flat, you know (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yes. They're usually plate-flat surfaces guided by some type of middle surface, and then a shell is usually a surface that has curvature in both radius of curvature in two directions, and so, that curvature adds a little more elasticity of, what we call, bending flexural elasticity relative to what a plate does, and so, it leads to more nonlinear equations of shells compared to what you might see in plate theories. And then three-dimensional bodies go into the straight three-dimensional elasticity equations and the theories of that, associated with that. And that's what I was looking at as a Ph.D. student.
Story_ID: 626197
Speaker 1: So this would, I guess--I'm just, as a layman here, I'm thinking, "Oh, so these studies would inform engineers who are constructing some--something that, in terms of how it reacts to certain vibrations, and so it would--
Speaker 2: Yeah. Typically, when you see dynamics of elasticity problems, you really have some type of free vibration motion. Think of the points in the elastic body shape behaving like simple oscillators, harmonica oscillators. But you have infinite number of points in that three-dimensional body. So the vibratory mode of a three-dimensional body would be very, very different than the kinematic assumptions they're associated with plate and shell theories, because they would add in other additional couplings of shear deformation, rotary inertia and other higher effects that are inherent in three-dimensional elasticity theory. At the time when we were looking at these problems, those problems weren't being examined fully in the literature because people were taking the low order, simpler solutions, and then, actually built link systems based on those assumptions. When you look at mathematical modeling today, you have to create your world in the mathematical world by making certain assumptions and then developing your model, a simple model that captures the essential physics, and then you make conclusions based on those assumptions. If you can extend the assumptions to full--to three-dimensional assumptions, then it's getting more closer to the real world, and that's what we examined the first time in the literature. And that has beget tremendous efforts. One in particular I'm thinking of is K. N. Blue [phonetic] who over--out over in--out in the Orient in the Asian bloc, has really done a tremendous amount of work and expanded beyond, arguably what Art and I, fundamentally--were fundamentally were doing very early with his students. And then he's really extended that field further as well. His first few grants were given by Bob Kielb, because he was interested, in part, looking at these vibration systems to be able to really understand the normal mode behavior for blades that are in aircraft engines, and they move and vibrate and they have instabilities of flutter, so we need to find out what that normal mode is. And so, Art [Arthur Leissa] and Bob Kielb were working closely together (unclear) and understand that problem, because at that time, the literature wasn't really fully clear on that yet. Now it's pretty commonplace. The reason about a Ph.D. thesis is that when you first do your thesis, it's fundamental questions and open question, but then they go into a career after, you know, 10 or 20 years, you're--hoping your thesis becomes obsolete. Mine is obsolete (laughs). Because people are still advancing in the subject and going on further, and some of the papers that I've done that made my thesis very obsolete.
Speaker 1: So at the time it was a contribution to the body of knowledge going forward.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And it was used, and not it's in the rearview mirror.
Speaker 2: Yes. We were tracing in the unknown.
Speaker 1: (unclear) something.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were discovering things out of their mathematically modeling, and discovering things out of the computer and looking at our assumption, and looking at our model, and then testing with unknown theories and solutions that were existing already.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My first paper I did with him was "The Three-Dimensional Vibrations of Skewed Plates" or skewed parallelepipeds. "Three-Dimensional Vibrations of Skewed Parallelepipeds." And that was published in the "Journal of Sound and Vibration." And that paper was significant enough because when a plate is skewed, like as such, when it's skewed like this direction. This is a straight plate, and this is a wall. When it's skewed in this corner here there is a singularity in stress that goes infinite. So you have to analyze what's going on at this corner, so that you can get this local affect established that goes into the global solution. And so, Art and I went further in this problem and looked at the corner-stress-singularities of such problems like this, along with a few additional Ph.D. students that we both shared and worked with. And we filled the literature with a lot of papers and solutions that addressed that very fundamental ply mechanics question. The great thing about working with Art and Bob is that, when you look at these fundamental questions and learn that research is about finding the question and then answer the question, and then you learn a process of research: how to mathematically model, and then how to establish that simple model that captures the essential physics, and then be able to answer some fundamental questions for others to pick up the problem--the question, and take it further. That's how the circle of knowledge is a chain--of knowledge is continued across centuries.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's science and technology. That's STEM. That's the fundamentals of STEM.
Story_ID: 626198
Speaker 1: Now, did you just adjust well to Arizona, I mean?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. Well, when I first landed in Arizona, I called my mother [Jean Arnold]. I remember I did that when I got off the plane in Tucson, and then she said, "Well, how you like it." I said, "Mom, it's so hot here I cannot believe it." Because I got off the plane around at 10:00 o'clock at night, it was 102 degrees. I've never been in a place as hot (with people?) in my life (laughs). It was in August, so that was the biggest adjustment in Tucson and to be in the desert for the first time. That's a hot desert. Phoenix sometimes gets to 110.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that as the adjustment, getting used to the heat. And then I finally took up the sport of cycling. And so, I was used to cycling, you know, 100 miles in, you know, a weekend on the bicycle in the desert. I was a cyclist when I was out there in Arizona.
Story_ID: 626199
Speaker 1: You got your Ph.D. in eighty--
Speaker 2: 1988.
Speaker 1: '88 [1988]. Okay.
Speaker 2: I was one of nine nationally, one of nine Ph.D.s given to African-Americans in all of engineering, nationwide in 1988, according to the National Science Foundation.
Speaker 1: Okay. How many total Ph.D.s do we have in--?
Speaker 2: They were giving about 3,000 at the time, according to the numbers. Approximately that. I don't have the exact numbers. It was around 3,000.
Speaker 1: So there were nine of--so--.
Speaker 2: Nine out of 3,000.
Speaker 1: What percentage? What does that boil down to? What fraction of a percent is that?
Speaker 2: Well, I know it's less than one percent. It's probably one-tenth of the one percent.
Speaker 1: Sounds--you're the mathematician (laughs).
Speaker 2: I'm thinking (laughs).
Speaker 1: So I guess--yeah, that's pretty good. I'll go with that.
Speaker 2: But it was a really--it was a charge of data--it was a charge for the National Science Board, because they were really tracking that. And they--that's when you began to see the National Science Foundation make a really strong push for bringing more African-Americans and women in science and technology. And when you think about it, Larry, not all of us of those nine went into academia. And so, I'm one of the ones that got out at that time. There're not many of us behind me. Right now I can think of two more that came out in 1990, and that's Gary May, who is the dean of engineering at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology]. And then there is the dean at UC [University of California] Irvine, which is Greg Williams. He's--not Greg Williams, but Gregory Washington. Greg Williams is the former of UC. Gregory Washington, he's the dean of engineering at UC Irvine. And they got their Ph.D.s around 1990. So there's not many people behind us. And now they came out and went into academia, and they're now leading major universities in their College of Engineering deanships, which is extraordinary. I'm really pleased for both of them because that's knocking down some critical walls and making a major, major difference.
Story_ID: 626200
Speaker 1: Okay. So where did you go? After graduation, did you do a post-doc?
Speaker 2: I came to Ohio State University, and I was a Senior Research Associate while I was doing my Ph.D., then promoted to an instructor, and then finally, I was named Assistant Professor of Civil Engineering at Ohio State. So I came back home, same department. And ended up in a faculty meeting with my former professors. It's like being in the faculty meeting with your parents. That was an experience. I was the youngest assistant professor, and the kids thought I was one of them. I met my first student, Michael Owings. I was teaching him numerical analysis and he instantly gravitated towards me to work with him for his mentoring because I tricked the class one day and I sat, on my first day in numerical analysis, I sat in front in front of the class as they were all coming in and sat in the seat. And they thought I was one of the students in the class. And then when everybody sat down, I waited for five minutes when the bell ranged. And I got up and said, "Good morning. I'm your professor, and everybody went 'Oh.'" (laughs). I think that's why I got his attention. They were just stunned. They said, "What?" Because they didn't know who Dr. McGee was or anything, and they thought, "Oh, my God." And that was tremendous for them because all of a sudden I was their first black teacher they ever had. And we really, really--it was a very rewarding teaching experience of me as an assistant professor at Ohio State.
Speaker 1: So is this in '88 [1988]?
Speaker 2: 1988.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Okay. Alright.
Speaker 2: I was starting my first tenure track position.
Speaker 1: Alright. And you became assistant professor in what year?
Speaker 2: 1988.
Speaker 1: Same--well, you started in '88 [1988], right?
Speaker 2: I actually started in '86 [1986] as a Senior Research Associate.
Speaker 1: Okay. Alright.
Speaker 2: And then in--I was promoted to Instructor, and then 1988 I was an Assistant Professor of Civil Engineering. So they were essentially trying to recruit me. They were just waiting for me to finish my Ph.D. They were recruiting me. Ohio State was actively recruiting me to become a part of their faculty, which was tremendously a rewarding experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's fundamental. If you see, Ohio State I as a student, and an alumnus, and now I'm a teacher. As you keep going, I'm more. I'm a company man at Ohio State.
Speaker 1: Okay. (laughs). What do you mean by that (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, if you look at what we're talking about, you know, I could smell the smells of Ivorydale in the neighborhood. I grew outside of Procter and Gamble. Ohio State is the Procter and Gamble of universities. That's the secret. Distinguished past, dynamic future. I always sit back and affectionately call Ohio State, Procter.
Story_ID: 626201
Speaker 1: How long did you stay at Ohio State [University]?
Speaker 2: I was at Ohio State from 1988 to 1992. I left Ohio State because I had a rewarding opportunity of some really nice things that kind of shaped my career while I was there: Collaborating with Arthur Leissa in scholarship and writing. I went on to win the National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Award from George Bush one. And then shortly after, I was named Ohio State Alumni Award for Distinguished Teaching, given to one of eight professors university-wide, whose students nominated me for one of the university's distinguished teachers. And that was--all came in about 1991 or so. And then he asked me to apply for tenure in my fourth year. He said, "You want major research award from National Science Foundation. You won the university's top distinguished teaching award. You might as well apply for tenure. And I did and they gave me tenure to promote me to Associate Professor. Shortly after I was promoted, Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology] called. Jean Lou Chaneu called me on the phone. Jean Lou Chaneu, that's J-E-A-N, L-O-U, C-H-A-N-E-U. He is now president of Cal Tech [California Institute of Technology]. But at the time he was Department Chair of Civil Engineering at Georgia Tech, and the Dean of Engineering at the time was another mentor of mine, John White, who happened to be the former Assistant Director for Engineering at the National Science Foundation, working with the National Science Board, and he knew I was one of nine African-Americans to receive a Ph.D. in engineering and I'm in the country. And so, he asked Jon Lou Chaneu, "Get Oliver down to Georgia Tech." So they picked me off of Ohio State. John White at that was trying to attract to Atlanta [Georgia] right before the Olympics to Georgia Tech, the most African-American faculty, black faculty on an engineering college in the country, and we had nine; me and Gary May were among them. And I went on to go to Howard University, and what did Gary May do? He graduated from Berkeley [University of California], he went on to become the Dean of Engineering at Georgia Tech. I think White and Jon Lou Chaneu made some pretty good decisions there, don't you think?
Speaker 1: It would seem so. So--
Speaker 2: Yeah. And Gary May worked very closely with Wayne Clough, who was the president of Georgia Tech. I was serving as a special assistant to Wayne Clough. I was at the White House. So Wayne Clough was looking at both of us and giving us opportunities. I owe my time at the White House for Wayne Clough saying, "Yes, let him go and do that." And allowing me to do that for four years. That was Wayne Clough.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 626202
Speaker 1: So this is--you go to the White House in 19--what is that?
Speaker 2: 1997.
Speaker 1: (unclear).
Speaker 2: But I was at--1995 was at MIT for visiting professorship. Charles Vest, who was the president of MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], created this extraordinary innovative program called, "The Martin Luther King Visiting Professor Program." And I was one of four inaugural members of that class, which included Wes Harris; National Academy of Engineering member, Wes Harris. He was in that first inaugural member. He was coming off of his associate directorship at NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] with Dan Golden. And he was MLK visiting professor along with myself. And that's where I met Charles Vest, who changed my life.
Speaker 1: Okay. In what sense?
Speaker 2: Charles Vest is a wonderfully, warm--he's quintessentially MIT. He's a walkish guy. You know he's--I mean he's a tall guy. You automatically want to have an intellectual conversation with him, but he's very caring. And he was a pivotal member of part of my life because I could have thoughtful conversations with him about engineering for public service. He taught me about engineering being a liberal education and how you could take your work in science and technology in STEM and give public service to the nation. He instilled that in me, inspired me with that. He was very focused in promoting the public in understanding of science, not only for MIT, but also for the nation. And he was on the president's committee of advisors for science and technology per Bill Clinton. So I met him at a mixer on campus while I was tooling away and the MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] guys' turbine lab, looking at air mechanical feedback control, working with a great collaborator that I had there, which was Martin B. Grath, who came out of (unclear) with me, and he singlehandedly taught me aircraft engine propulsion. Good, old Martin B. Grath. And I was working with Ed Greitser (ph. splg.), and Al Epstein, and Luther LeChet (ph. splg.), who was the co-author of a paper we did together. And I went, met Charles Vest at a mixer and--. MIT is about relationships, and he introduced me to his special assistant, and he instilled in me to apply and encouraged me to apply for the White House Fellows Program. And I said yes. And Charles Vest was an advisor for me, a referee for me for the White House Fellows Program.
Story_ID: 626203
Speaker 1: The White House Fellows is an extraordinary experience. I was introduced to it because I read Colin Powell's book. He has a wonderful chapter on his experience in becoming a White House Fellow. And I think that's really--it's part of a lot of young Americans in their mid-career to apply for the program because he does just about the best explanation of what you can expect from the program. I would--was applying from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], I was in the Boston area. I had made the top 100. They have a good, oh, I would say 10,000 applicants. But I made the top 100. And the reason it was an extraordinary experience because you had to write five essays. And I remember I was writing those essays. And another that was pushing me, it was a dear friend of mine, Rosemary Wagner, which is like a second family to me. And she's the lady that's in the picture in the White House. And that's one of the reasons why I wanted to invite (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: How did you meet her, and what was the--?
Speaker 1: Marching band. Me and my friend, my best friend Clif Ursick (ph. splg.), we were roommates together, and he wind up marrying her daughter, Mary Ann Wagner (ph. splg.). And I was his roommate and we used to go up to the farm. It was a good way to get away from the pressures of school and go up to a farm and have a good old-fashioned country meal and do some chores on the farm; feeding pigs and, you know, baling hay, and just, had (plain?), and having fun on a farm, the Wagners. And there were six kids. They had MaryAnn, and Carol, and Dale, and Alan, and Charles, and Tommy and--I think I got them all. And they were, you know, we were just--we all had a good time, and then she was the mother and Tom was the father. And so, she helped me craft the essays. She was a reader and teaching me how to write for ordinary Americans, and why I wanted to be a White House Fellow. And, we were pleased that they liked it. And they pulled me in in the top 100 regional. I had to go to regional interviews. I went through those. That was a regional interview in Boston [Massachusetts]. And then they went back and deliberated, and then they winded up choosing the top 30 national finalists, and I was one of them.
Story_ID: 626204
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what--can you choose what kind of duty you would perform at the White House as a Fellow or did they have certain categories for you?
Speaker 2: You do have to answer the questions in the essays, "What would you like to do as a White House Fellow?" And I had expressed that I'd like to work for the president's science advisor. I wanted to do some work I science policy and, you know, and that was inspired by what Chuck Vest would inspire me on, the public understanding of science at the time, and making science understanding--helpful for society, and give back to society. We do our work and our calculus in our laboratories, but it's got to be useful for society. So that was my focus. And the top 30 national finalists' interview was at the Naval Academy in Annapolis. And you go there for about two or three days. They give you this big, giant matrix where they're interviewing all of the commissioners of the White House Fellows Commission. And the reason they choose 30 is because they're actually selecting about 14 or 15 final fellows. And typically, they choose three or four of those from the military, because Johnson actually formed his fellowship from the military. He wanted to have the military complex to understand the policy side of government, and that's why he formed this White House fellowship. So, they typically have, you know, military folks going through. And they have sort of like a two of a kind, two of every kind, like in Noah's ark. And that was my first experience of being like a "reality" television program, "The Apprentice" or you might say whatever television shows you see in that, you know, that thing that you see on television where they're going through. So we were like Noah's ark; two of every kind. And so, they had two scientists; me and a young lady from Minnesota. And we just kind of raced our way through that for two or three days. And it was an endurance match. You see if you can keep up with the endurance and last. And I was doing so fine, and then I got confused in the matrix one day, I missed one of my interviews. And that interview was with the one renowned Roger Porter, who was Bush One's Economic and Domestic Policy Advisor. I got mixed up, a matrix, and I got the wrong time, and he was sitting where and saying, "Where's Oliver?" (laughs). Of course, Larry, I was bounced out (laughs). But I'm pretty sure it's part of the discussion, you know. I learned a valuable lesson that you have to be on time and time is a very important thing in life. It was a very important lesson I had to learn. Still learning it. But I want to share with the young people. Watch your time.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, you didn't get a chance to be--now, okay, what. You didn't get a chance to serve as a White House Intern.
Speaker 2: That's right. I didn't get selected.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Along the way, I had the help of Uncle Chuck. He was disappointed. He said, "Oh, well, I'm sorry about that, Oliver. You got to learn a valuable lesson on that." And then he--two weeks later, I got a call from John Deutch, who was the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and Ernie Moniz, who was the Undersecretary of Science in the White House Science Office. And they wanted for me to meet in their offices at MIT. Ernie Moniz was the chair of the physics department, and John Deutch was a faculty member of the physics department. And those were two of the most momentous meetings I've ever had at that time in my career. John Deutch was a wonderful gentleman. Very, very soft spoken; very stately. His office was a highly decorated place of plaques from presidents dating back to Nixon. And he's been on so many boards and commissions. And he just simply looked at my resume and he asked me one question: "Oliver, why do you want to serve?"
Speaker 1: And (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: And I told him, "I want to serve because I want to make a difference. I want to make a difference in science and technology. I want to understand science policies so we can increase the public's understanding of science. It's a very simple answer." And he said, "Thank you." And then I spoke with Ernie Moniz afterwards and he gave me a book on "Science with a National Interest," that he had wrote for President Clinton. And he said, "What do you think of this?" And we went over it and talked about it, and we talked about the issues in it. And it was a very delightful interview. And then two weeks later I got a call from the White House from Daryl Chubin. He said, "Hello. I'm the Assistant Director for Science and we've been looking at your background here, and we would like for you to come and talk with us, and the President's Science Advisor would like to have a conversation with you." After I picked my jaw up off of the floor, I flew to Washington and had a day of interviews in the White House Science Office. It was--wonderful people. Wonderful people. Daryl Chubin and Bev Hartline and Arthur Bienenstock, who is in the upper administration at Stanford [University], and Duncan Moore. The science advisor was Jack Gibbons. I met Cynthia Chase, who was the secretary; and Donna Coleman. And they had a White House intern named James Bucksbaum (ph. splg.). And we all had lunch and everything. And then the two--oh, I'd say about a week later, they said, "When can you join us? We like you."
Story_ID: 626205
Speaker 1: Okay. So this is 1994?
Speaker 2: No. 1997 to 1999.
Speaker 1: Okay. Yeah, 1997 to--.
Speaker 2: That was in the second term of the [President William] Clinton Administration.
Speaker 1: So 1997 to--towards--.
Speaker 2: And so, I really got to the White House by accident through a thoughtful mentor, Chuck Vest, who just happened to introduce me to some of his MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] friends. And he was working very closely with Jack Gibbons, who was the President's Science Advisor. And what he was sharing with me is, "Don't give up. If you really want to serve, keep going." And that's what MIT is about. It's about creating those relationships. Nothing is impossible at MIT. None of the questions that you raise to solve at MIT are impossible. All you need to do is just roll up your sleeve and learn the subject. When I went to MIT in the gas turbine lab, I did not know really about thermal fluid physics of flow inside aircraft engines. And then I met Martin Grath, who simply, like--you ever see the movie, "The Firm," where he comes walking in and drops in and he says, "Here's contracts." Here's tort. Here's everything you want to know about equity and trust." Boom. And he just laid these huge notebooks about propulsion. "Here's Greicher's course on internal flows." Boom. "Read this." And what he was doing, Martin was saying, "If you can go through and read this and understand this, then we can talk." And then when we did--and when I did do that work spending all night in John deGunge's (ph. splg.) office while he was on leave, spending nights and nights and nights in that office by myself, just learning about internal flows. I went back and conversations with Martin and all of a sudden he said, "Boy, you really have learned this. Well, we're going to collaborate." And then I wrote my first paper on aircraft engine propulsion, "Air Mechanical Feedback Control of Axial Compression Stall." It was the extension of the 1995 gas turbine award-winning paper written by Ed Greitser. And that created additional gifts. We are just publishing the paper on air mechanical feedback control of high-speed axial compression stall for which I had the opportunity to train another black kid, Keith Coleman at Ohio State [University], who picked up my paper in the "Literature" with Martin and brought it to my office and said, "Dr. McGee, how did you do this? I want to learn what you just learned here at MIT." And he was a civil engineer, and when I was department chair there, the top 10 student there. And I said, "Well, we can teach you that. I had to learn the hard way. I'll teach you." And I sat through with him, his first propulsion class that was taught at Ohio State. I audited the class with him and went to every class with him, and then had tutoring sessions like at the University of Cambridge-style, and taught him propulsion, singlehandedly. And he went on and helped me write the extension that worked high-speed axle compression stall. Along the way, he happened to pick up a few awards: a National Science Graduate Student of Fellowship in 2007, a Defense Graduate Fellowship, and a Ford Diversity Fellowship; all in the same year. He went to MIT and Harvard [University] with $200,000 in scholarships in his pocket, and helped me write two of the most fundamental papers in my career: "High-Speed Axial--Control of Axial Stall" for the "Journal of Fluids Engineering." Except about 13 percent of the papers, worldwide. I'm proud of that paper, because it's done with my first African-American rocket scientist that I helped train and mentor and create. He's now working for a major consulting firm in Atlanta [Georgia]. And I just nominated him for "Black Engineer of the Year Award" from Career Communications Group, the same award that I won in 1996. That's mentoring. Keith Coleman is my pride and joy. And I am mentoring Keith as Chuck Vest mentored me and as Julian Earls mentored me. So once again, the mentor-mentee relationship is the most relationship in one's life. Keeps you safe from moral hazard, but also does a lot of inspiration along the way.
Story_ID: 626206
Speaker 1: So, you served at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] through the White House on this right until, from '97 [1997] until--?
Speaker 2: '97 [1997] to 1999. Okay.
Speaker 1: And then one day I was at the salad bar and--the White House salad bar. I was getting a salad and was joking about it with this gentleman who was next to me, who was very, very funny. We were talking about the salad bar. We kind of just were talking about macaroni salads and the salads at barbeque dinners and so forth. A stately, African-American man, and he was at the salad bar, and boy, he just really had me cracking up. He was just--we were just joking and having a good time. And, you know, I was free and easy with him. We were just cracking up. And I went back to the office and I said, "I just met this man and he was so--" I was talking to Cynthia Chase in the White House Science Office. I said, "I met this man and he just was really making me laugh. We were joking about the way our salad--." And she said, "Well, who were you talking to, Oliver?" And I said, "Well, Cynthia, I was talking to Bob Nash." And she said--she looked at me and went, "Who were you talking to?" I said, "Bob Nash." She said, "Do you know who that is?" And I go, "No." She said, "Oliver, you were talking to Clinton's personnel director." (laughs). I went, "What?" (laughs). He was so delightful. I just thought he was the most charming man. And then a week or two later, he called me in his office. I thought I was being called to the principal's office for talking too bad for the salad bar. And he called me and he said, "You know what? You know, you're one of the first African-American males in the White House Science Office?" I said, "Really?" And he introduced--said, "I have a good friend who could really use you." And he said, "His name is Rodney Slater, and he's looking for a technology advisor to drive some technology in his department. Would you be willing to go over there and talk to him?" I said, "Sure." Yeah, you're the man. I'm going. I'll follow your orders. And then he sent me over there and he started giving me a clinic on politics, you know, Clinton, you know. He taught me about the guns and the money. He said, "Most of my appointments deal with the guns and the money." And I was just listening to great lessons on how he does presidential appointments. Larry, I went to Harvard [University], the John F. Kennedy School of Government to study government public policy. Had a fantastic teacher, the late Dick Neustadt has a fundamental book on presidential decision-making. It's called "Presidential Power," by Dick Neustadt. He's taught all Harvard kids coming out of Kennedy School of Government about presidential decision-making. And he said the president has three powers: The power to appoint, the power to sign, and the power to persuade. That's the fundamentals of his book. I think his book is right on this shelf that you are looking at. And I don't know if I see it. But it'll be great to show it up, because I--you're this is a video for helping and inspiring kids, and reaching for as high as they want to go. But presidential decision-making through the eyes of Dick Neustadt, which I've had an opportunity to sit down and talk with and get counseled by before he had passed. And Bob Nash was in charge of one of the powers of the presidency; the power to appoint. And he was in charge of placing the decision memo on the President's desk to put me in as a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Rodney Slater which was invoking the President's power to sign.  So that is what Bob Nash is a mentor of mine to this day. He has this friend, good friend, Bill Clinton. And he showed me pictures of him and Bill Clinton with afros (laughs), and plaid pants with Rodney Slater, working all the details of Arkansas politics. And he brought me in and gave him the confidence that he had in me to his friend Bill Clinton and his friend Rodney Slater, which was a joy to work for. And guess who else was helpful in getting me the job with Rodney Slater?
Speaker 2: Who's that?
Speaker 1: My good friend, Chuck Vest. He wrote a letter to the secretary, and the secretary to this day still talks about that letter. That was a big decision for him. I said, "Oh. I gotta hire a guy about technology, gets a letter from the president of MIT."  That's why I call him Uncle Chuck. Chuck Vest has to value diversity. He did it at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology]. He does it throughout his career. He does it as the President of the National Academy of Engineering. This video series that you're doing right here, HistoryMakers, I asked you and you asked for me to nominate some people. I asked you to nominate Chuck Vest for that. Because I don't know if you have to be African-American necessarily to do this. You do? (laughs). Well, okay. Well, I'll just do it. He is really one of the most amazing people and he was the head of GEM. He puts a young black kid from Cincinnati [Ohio] in the White House after I botched the White House Fellows Program. I mean, you know, mentoring is about forgiving and then they give you a chance--a second chance to be persistent and correct. Life is about corrections. It's about mistakes and having a second chance to try again. And, you know Chuck Vest is one of those really, really good people testing the value of diversity like Bill Clinton.
Story_ID: 626207
Speaker 1: Okay. Alright. Now you have--tell us about this experience. This has got--now, you're there during the--some of the really hot days at the White House. There was a lot of heat on the presidency, and probably the revolution had taken place in '94 [1994] (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: I was after that.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yes. So you're coming in and I think the--
Speaker 2: The second term.
Speaker 1: --Congress had--was the Congress still down there? Anybody republicans in '97 [1997]?
Speaker 2: Yes. Trenton Lott was the Senate Majority Leader.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. A Southern gentleman.
Speaker 1: He's a neighbor of yours now.
Speaker 2: Yes. And very good friends with Rodney Slater. And Rodney Slater is probably one of the few cabinet appointees that got bipartisan, unanimous confirmation to be Secretary of Transportation. And was liked by Republicans bipartisan-wise because he was a gentleman. And Bill Clinton was a consternate politician, so the success of Bill Clinton in early part of the second term was since he was able to cross into the bipartisanship lines, and that in spite of the ranger; in spite of the ranger.
Speaker 1: Now, Trent Lott got in trouble for making a remark that concerned Strom Thurman or something or wasn't it (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do, do recall that.
Speaker 1: I can't remember exactly what he said. He had something to do with the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was a reflection on the Civil Rights Movement that wasn't taken very well.
Speaker 2: I have been--what I learned about politics in Washington, because my mom [Jean Arnold] said, "You got to go in there and you're going to sit and you're going to listen, and you're going to take lots of notes, you're to keep your mouth shut, your ears open, and it's going to be like you came out with a college degree." And she was absolutely right about that. And then I came out with another college degree, because I often call my time in the White House as another college degree. That's my fifth degree. Washington is like a Roman agora. And we often say things, and then we go, "Oh, I wish we could take that back," or it was out of context. So that's the way I usually look at all of that. It's the drama that takes place inside the Roman agora. And then you have the media, very involved in the politics, and then you got the business sector involved in that. When I first came into that public life, I had no idea how America runs. I'm trying to get through college and grow up in Cincinnati [Ohio]. And I had no aspirations to serve publicly. I wasn't aiming for a career in public policy. I just had a simple conversation with a very nice man, Chuck Vest, who inspired me, "Think out of the box. Serve." As I look at Stanford [University] and what they're doing in their undergraduate, they're saying from their founding principles, education for life in service, and benefit for society. So that's what I was learning early on. What are you doing in engineering, whether you choose engineering as an education or vocation, what are you doing in translating that for the benefit of a larger society? So that was my opportunity to do that. And from that, I learned about what matters most in our country. I paid attention. And along the way I've met some very, very talented people along the way; Bob Nash and a very talented Cabinet secretary, who went around the world talking about the benefits of transportation. Mortimer Downey, who was his Deputy Secretary, was the best Deputy Secretary I've ever observed, knew everything about trains, planes and automobiles. And he just ran that department like it's an elder statesman. There's an inside man and there's an outside man. And Rodney Slater was using the presidential power of persuasion on the outside game, and Mortimer Downey was running the inside game. Ultimately, as Secretary of Transportation is a banker. It's a banker. It runs the federal highway fund, and the transportation trust fund. So it's a banker in charge of the trust; a trust not only the Safety and Security of Transportation, but an actual trust. And so, Rodney Slater came with that experience at Arkansas, and Marty Doki, Board on Commissions, and he went on and joined Northwest Board and all kinds of other things. Mortimer Downey just knew everything about how to push policy through, through the clubs of Deputy Secretaries across all the Cabinets. And I was in charge of crafting the Secretary's vision of Transportation Policy Architecture for the 21st Century, which it was a follow-on of his predecessor, the first black Transportation Secretary, William T. Coleman, who wrote "Trains and Choices in Transportation." So I was the Sherpa, the do-person, to be able to drive that through for the last two years of Secretary's Slater's term. And we got that out 12 days before he retired as Transportation Secretary. And that's his legacy document. But that happened because of the team work of Deputy Secretary Mortimer Downey, you know, heard Merv give a presentation to the Leadership Team and said, "You know, we got to make this happen to support Oliver to do this." It's a very complex policy to get through. It took me two years to do that, along with the complex policies I had to work with on meeting America's needs for its scientific and technological challenges of the 21st century in support of President Clinton's initiative on race for the White House Science Office. Complex policies that I had to get through for which, you know, Chuck Vest was observing that, and the Secretary of Transportation were observing that, and those aren't easy policies to get through government-wide in a large agency. But we did it. And I didn't do it. A lot of other people helped. And we winded up winning the "Partnership of Excellence Award" for the Secretary of Transportation.
Story_ID: 626208
Speaker 1: So did you serve through the Clinton Administration?
Speaker 2: The second term.
Speaker 1: Through the second? Okay.
Speaker 2: I have fond memory of spending the very last day in my role in the department, my very last day of service before I came back here, home, with my box, my little box as you leave, was with the Secretary's Chief of Staff--(pause). I just had a senior moment (laughs). It'll come up.
Speaker 1: (unclear). Go ahead.
Speaker 2: It'll come to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Secretary of Chief of Staff, and we were sitting there talking about how it is to be the last one here. Gerri Malone. Yeah. Gerri Malone. My girlfriend Gerri Malone. And we were sitting there discussing, you know, how it was an honor to serve together, and my last moments were just helping Gerri Malone pack his box, and as I had my box, and I learned that administrations have an orderly transition of power and it's very humbling and quiet. And we were listening to Bush's speech as he was taking on the mantles of Bush Two of the presidency. And we were packing our boxes and leaving quietly and moving on with the rest of our lives. You come in humbly and you leave humbly. And you, it's like a passing of life. And it's really very non-eventful. I like that. Actually, that was one of my fondest memories of serving. How humbling it was to figure out "what's next?" And you know what I decided to do, Larry? Both the secretary and Bill Clinton had said that, the business of America, it's business. And I decided to go to business school. I came here and said, "I'm going to go to Wharton." I went to the advanced management program at Wharton, and that opened my eyes on business. Wharton is one of the most extraordinary schools of high finance. It was like I was a learner again. I was back in school again just like I was back at Woodward High School. And that beget going to the University of Chicago, which is a place of Nobel laureates of economics. Seventy Nobel laureates of economics at the University of Chicago. It's Milton Friedman's school of business.
Speaker 1: Okay. So at the Wharton School, you earned a certificate or a (unclear)?
Speaker 2: A CPD. Certificate of Professional Development.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You're supposed to do that in four years, and I did it in one. I was a ferocious learner at Wharton. I--can you imagine being a scientist and technologist and learning the theory of high finance? You know, we have four policies that we're focusing on right now, Larry. We're focusing--America is focusing on industrial policy in the industrial organization. It's focusing on economic and financial policy. It's focusing now on energy policy, even environment policy. And it's focusing on health policy. And the common line that runs through all that is the business-government relations. I had learned the government, now I had to learn the business. The business-government relations in the United States I learned is the Fourteenth Amendment. And I wrote about that in my latest book.
Story_ID: 626209
Speaker 1: When I went to Chicago [Illinois], it was like being at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] gas turbine lab. I never saw a school that teaches business and economics like gas, turbine, and engine technology. They hurt my brain up there. I took my first accounting course and flunked it. Out of 240 people going through the program worldwide, I got the lowest grade.
Speaker 2: Now, that's surprising because you're a math man.
Speaker 1: I know. I couldn't tell the difference between the asset and the liability. And I couldn't do it fast enough. Larry, I was devastated, because if I don't pass the accounting, the language of business, I couldn't even get through the rest of the program. It was so fast. And when they look at accounting in Chicago [Illinois], they look at the economics behind the finance. But to look at the scores posted worldwide of 240 students in the class, and you're the bottom, it was an humbling experience. I said, "Oh, well. That's my life. Pick myself up from the bottom and figure out how to learn it by myself." I met with Kathleen Fitzgerald. I went to the campus and hired her as a tutor. She cost me a thousand dollars. She spent--I had five weeks to learn accounting from Professor Hannah. And she taught me in five weeks for a thousand dollars, the language of business. She taught me how to get through GE's financial statements. I'm sharing that with--this with you, Larry, and the students. It's once you learn the literacy of science and technology and engineering and mathematics, you have to tie it to the commerce. Because with technology and capital formation, and how capital happens, that's how America remains competitive. And that's how I remain competitive. And that's history.
Speaker 2: Okay. So, University of Chicago, then, you finished in 2007, right, I think it was?
Speaker 1: 2004.
Speaker 2: 2004. I'm sorry. 2004. So, you lived in Chicago [Illinois], I suppose, for--.
Speaker 1: I was Department Chair of Civil Engineering at Ohio State, one of the larger departments at Ohio State.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: One of the more important departments in engineering. I was the first African-American full professor and Department Chair. And I was flying over the weekends to Chicago [Illinois] to sit in class. And I was given permission to do that by another great mentor, James C. Williams, who came out of G.E. Crotonville [New York]. He was a head of materials and world with Brian Rowe, who was another pivotal member of my family of mentors, who ran all the G.E. aircraft engines. And I think Jim let me do that because he was a little concerned, but I think he understood because he went to Crotonville. And to this day, I remember talking with him. He's retired now. I thanked him for changing my life, because if he ever sees this statement, I'm thank you, Jim, because what I just said to you just now, because after I finished the Clinton Administration, I knew I had more learning to do. I learned how the government works. I had to learn the second half how America works. America works as a business-government relationship, Fourteenth Amendment. And I wrote about that in my latest book.
Story_ID: 626210
Speaker 1: Now, what's the name of your latest book?
Speaker 2: "Jumping The Aisle: How I Became a Black Republican in the Age of Obama."
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: That's a rhetorical question.
Speaker 1: Yes (laughs).
Speaker 2: It's really about belief in America. It's not about yea or nay or any candidate or anything like. Most people were looking at the book, "Why you're writing about America?" I find America fascinating under the [President Barack] Obama Era. You know, when we elected the first black president, we made America interesting. Whether you're for him or against him, you got to understand the ride is fun, and we're paying attention. And that's what black leadership does. We're so innovative when we do it. We have to be creative. We have to be nimble. We have to try and test things. Some things work, some things do not. We have to listen. We have to be able to mend our mistakes. We got to keep trying. And then we have to know when to step down. Because everything we're doing is history. So America is interesting under the Obama because it's about history. So I wrote a book about that, respecting the history and showing the way, and then looking to a future on getting to 2076. And those are wonderful principles of leadership learned from Mike Eusem (ph. splg.) at Wharton School in his leadership course. Oh, Mike Eusem. Mike Eusem had us climbing a tree to learn leadership at Wharton. When I went through that course, I was wondering, "Why are we climbing a tree?" But he was teaching us how leadership is dependent on those who are under you, as well as those who are pulling you up. The Age of Obama is doing that now. Valerie Jarrett, one of your HistoryMakers is doing that now. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are doing that now. The American people are doing that now. Because we're doing leadership and making the decision, independent decision.
Story_ID: 626211
Speaker 1: Yeah. I was asking about UNCF [United Negro College Fund], but then you said it occurs right after the MBA.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Right after MBA, I wanted to kind of share the lovely moment of that pivotal change of receiving an MBA degree in Rockefeller's church at the University of Chicago. I never in my life did I expect to be going to another graduation so late in life, but that was a glorious, personal experience. And my sister, when they announced my name in the Rockefeller's church in the University of Chicago, and I went down the stage and held it up, and it was quiet. One of the few African-Americans in the class. My sister was in the back of the church and she went, "Weeb. Weeb." Like Weebee (laughs).
Speaker 1: Now, for those you don't under it, Rockefeller [Memorial] Chapel is a huge, gothic edifice with a--it was huge (unclear) place. And that--I mean I ask people to (unclear) that would weep in coming out of this great big place.
Speaker 2: It went through an echo, and it was gothic in the way it does. And I remember having a tear come in my eye because I heard in the back of the church, and it's such a beautiful place. You know, Rockefeller's Church, it formed the University of Chicago. And we went on and put our clothes on, and our tuxedos, and then we went to a lavish party and partied through the night. It was just one of the most glorious, wonderful days that I ever spent with my sister, Sherri, on that day. And it encouraged my sister, Sherri, to go on and get her MBA degree. And then my other sister, Brenda, went on and got her degree after that, because they saw me did another degree late in life. So, that was a really wonderful day.

Speaker 1: So after that, I went in and I was introduced to Michael Lomax of the UNCF [United Negro College Fund]. I was called in to help him start his Institute for Capacity Building in his new presidency of the UNCF. And that was my introduction to philanthropy. At the time, they raised $100,000,000 a year in financial security and systems for 48 HBCU institutions. And I was brought to that by Veronica Biggins, who was [President William] Clinton's Personnel Director in the first term. Bob Nash was her Associate Personnel Director, and he went on and took on the second term after she went to take on a job at the Higher Education Practice. And I was also introduced to Chuck Nap, who was also head of Higher Education Practice at Heidrick and Struggles, and he was tapping me into a couple of jobs and encouraged me to take him to Department Chair position at Ohio State [University]. And he became a mentor, and encouraged me to go on and take UNCF as well. And Chuck Nap--I call them both Chuck and Chuck. Chuck Vest and Chuck Nap. Chuck Nap is President of Georgia in Tulane, and President of the Aspen Institute. He introduced me to the Aspen Institute. And so, UNCF was an opportunity to give back in a philanthropic way and work with the Institute on Capacity Building, and watch a new type of leadership following Bill Gray, and watching George Ayers, who had been a big writer for Bill Gray in creating the Bill Gates Fund for that institution with Bill Gray, who was a very good friend with LaValle Bond. So you see how all the threads all come together? I think one's life is all going around in circles of common people who all knowed (sic) each other, and if you think you're meeting someone isolated, no, no, no. They're all connected with each. And you--when you look back on your life, you see how everything has been going in a full circle. And so, that was an extraordinary experience of just walking. I remember one day walking down Park Avenue with Michael Lomax as he's--you know, that was his everyday, you know, working with Corporate America and giving--at that time--$100,000,000 a year. I'm pretty sure they're doing a lot more than that now. Maybe up to $200,000,000 a year. That's a very, very fast fundraising. But I, you know, took notes and, like I did at the White House, watch, and listened. I'm very interested in philanthropy as I'm taking that on as an American Council of Education fellow, and looking into fundraising for what I'd like to call, "the church of higher education." Those institutions, they have such challenges in raising money for keeping the doors open. So that was my experience with UNCF, and then that opened the door for Howard [University], who was looking for their first vice president for research, to help them work with the National Science Foundation and, you know, really establish some constructs for managing research at the Harvard [University] of HBCU's, which is Howard University. And I was introduced to a wonderful provost, Richard English, where he was a Michigan man, I as an Ohio State man, and we had breakfasts, and we'd just become very, very good friends. And then I got to watch and observe an extraordinary president in Pat Swygert. A smart man. And just sitting in his Cabin meetings and listening to him think about the issues of what he was doing in running this university. And one of the great universities, and how he was so connected with Washington, D.C. circles, and working with [Stephen] Joel Trachtenberg at Georgia--at George Washington University, and they were very close friends. But Pat Swygert was a thinking president. Very, very nimble, and very politically savvy. Smart president. And I as largely watching him, and then I think he was really supportive of what I was trying to do in writing research at Howard. And we created research at the Capstone, which is the brand name for Howard University. And as there's a subject in one of my books that I wrote on "Breaking the Black Research Gap."
Story_ID: 626213
Speaker 1: After Pat Swygert stepped down a year later, and then I went to the faculty and went back to the basics of teaching kids thermal dynamics.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then--that's been a joy because the Howard [University] students are wonderful in the classroom. If you teach kids jet propulsion--black kids--jet propulsion, rocket science, thermal dynamics, one of the powerful STEM areas, and then seeing their eyes open, the questions they have is just extraordinary. I feel, once again, I'm in a position of national service. People ask, "What do you do for a living?" I say, "I teach black kids rocket science." That's a great contribution to the country.
Speaker 2: I'd say so.
Speaker 1: And I do it with a smile on my face. I say, "I teach black kids rocket science," just like I did Keith Coleman. If there's anything I'm left to do in this life, I at least got, you know, 20-odd kids that understand the intellectualism of propulsion science, a.k.a., Lonnie Reed, at NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] Glenn Research Center. He describes propulsion science as an intellectual philosophy. And I'm in the legacy of Julian Earls, just inspiring black kids to just go for it at the highest levels of science and technology. I'm looking forward to getting back after my ACE [American Council on Education] Fellowship, to then start teaching the mathematic modeling of propulsion science, and say, "How does mathematical modeling and how you can simplify that to be able to look at fundamental questions of propulsion science, simple models of capture is essential physics. I'm in the process again, of a learner, of teaching mathematical modeling, and re-inventing how I think about my undergraduate education, because I'm looking at how Stanford [University] is rethinking that. I'm looking at how UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles] is thinking about that. And what those schools are doing. UCLA is the big Procter and Gamble of the West Coast, public juggernaut. And Stanford is the big private institution of the West Coast. And they have different things and different ways to look at this. They can be shared with the East Coast schools. We're the Harvard of HBCUs, Howard. And that's how you reunite these two schools for research capacity building, which is the focus of my book, "Bridging the Black Research Gap." And that's what I'm going to be doing my fellowship here, in the American Council of Education fellow.
Story_ID: 626214
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, you began your fellowship--.
Speaker 2: Now.
Speaker 1: It's just beginning?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: Thanks to Howard University president, Sidney A. Ribeau.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's had the vision to, "We're going to trust Oliver and put him out there and do this." Thank you, Sidney Ribeau.
Speaker 1: Okay. Alright. Now, I want--
Speaker 2: And Wayne Frederick, the provost of Howard. He's a wonderful man. He's watching me (laughs).
Speaker 1: I can't help thinking that you're on the path of becoming a college president?
Speaker 2: Yes, I am. That's why I applied for the ACE [American Council on Education] Fellowship.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughs).
Speaker 1: There you go. Alright.
Speaker 2: Yeah. You know, my mentors, Chuck and Chuck and Julian Earls, my mother [Jean Arnold] was a mentor, my friend, Larry, and my dear late friend, Dr. Chris smith, the late LaValle Bond. They, you know, Bob Nash--they've all said, you know, lead. And I have been surrounded around presidents and just admired them, of universities. You know, they're five institutions, Larry. There's the family, there's the church, there's government, there's the university, and there's the corporation. Well, my experience has been through the one of the five institutions university. So, my aim in life is to some day become a university president and work with the church of higher education, raise money, in the art of philanthropy, and give college degrees at graduation day. I think that's a wholesome way to give up your life.
Story_ID: 626215
Speaker 1: And if you ask me a question on what I feel is the most contribution in my life, the biggest contribution I've made in my life, students. Nine NSF [National Science Foundation] Fellows, who have been honored and somehow I've had an impact on their lives. Keith Coleman, Celeste Chavis, Dan Work, Rory Kennedy, Derek Miller, Kelsey Shaler, Micah [Springer]. These are all listed on my website, and helping kids to be able to compete for a national award like that, 10,000 applicants, 14,000 applicants a year, and then they're able to go on for the rest of their lives. You can go in and get a Ph.D. like I was inspired by Julian Earls. But it's so much more costly to get that now, so they need funding, and they need to compete. And they learn competition fast on that, but in science and technology areas. And then, you know, other great students, Mike Owings, and Peter Stewart, and Joshua Ricker, Dustin Elworth (ph. splg.). These are folks that I co-mentored. Joshua was a former marine who was just trying to get an associate degree. So I'm mentoring a veteran, who came from the Iraq War. Kirk Lukins (ph. splg.), Todd Beckman (ph. splg.), and indirectly Anthony Gonzalez (ph. splg.), you know, football players, athletes, who've gone on to great things in their life. And I've had a chance and the honor to walk through their lives. And so, I'm giving back to Ohio State football more than just the marching band. You know, when you give to students and young people, and then they go on, they last way much longer than you do in your life. My life is a moment in time and here, and it's really how you make a different in the future. And that's why I wrote "On Getting to 2076" in the last part of my book because teaching kids about commerce and government and technology, and making America competitive for the next generation, the generation after next. And we are competitive as a nation when we are competitive in the stem fields. And that's what, you know, the purpose of what we're talking about here, science and technology and engineering and mathematics leads to our productive power. And I like to try to keep discussion going with young people because I've had my chance in time, and I guess you've helped me to review that here. Now it's theirs.
Speaker 2: The students are your legacy.
Speaker 1: Yes. Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And if you're university president, you're focused on that student aspects (sic) and achievement. Ultimately, I think presidents Pat Swygert, Sidney Ribeau, John Hennessey at Stanford [University], Gene Block at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles], Gordon Gate [College], Ohio State [University]. The thrill they have every year is graduation, because they get to give dream papers. Hundreds of them. And each year they're changing kids' lives to go on and keep America moving. I think, ultimately, that's what we're looking at right now, an America, the belief in that. Belief in America. That works. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Story_ID: 626216
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African-American community today?
Speaker 2: My concern is what I walked through in my own life. I had to first become technically competent. So I spent the early part of my life, as you've help me to see, and it's come clear to me in this wonderful discussion I've had with you, Larry, that I had to really take a challenge of looking at math and science and engineering and technology; just become technically competent. Julian Earls first instilled that into me, and Minnie McGee. "Attack a technical career." And Marty Reed, "Look at the intellectualism of that." And then I had to figure out how to use that education, and then give back to some benefit to society; make a difference like I say on my website. And then after I do that, I have to figure out how to work with the economics and commerce of that. Understand commerce. So not only do we face in our community technical literacy, but we have to really look at financial literacy, seriously. It's more than just reading literacy. It's about how to run a small business. It's about how to be an entrepreneur. It's about how to look at the changing ways that we do finance, and the evolving restructuring of American economy. If we don't do that, I don't know where we're going to be as a people, and the next generation, and generation after next. We may have concerns and issues and problems now, but it's the next generation and generation after next in capital formation and technology, and in free market competition. Wharton [School] and [University of] Chicago sort of may be right in that way, where I may still have some issues that have put me socially left, centered left on some social issues, but the country is center right for the most part. And we have to really be engaged in doing that. And I'm concerned that we need to look at more aspects of what we're doing in that capital area; more black bankers, more accountants, more folks who understand the commerce and policy and the changing economics. It's changed before our eyes. And how do we engage more of us in technology to move that. What I learned in what Chicago is, the supply side is about technology and competition and capital--it's basically technology and capital. And that leads to the supply side. The demand side is consumers and investments and government and trade. But you have to have the supply first in order to meet the demand. We have to have some of us looking at the supply very, very carefully. Not demonizing the supply siders. Not just looking at the demand and the pull side. That's what I worry about the black community. How much of us are pushing on the supply side so that we can have a seat at the table to shape the demand? You kind of see where I'm trying to go?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Right. There's a --conversations have been going on a long time?
Speaker 2: Yes. And it's something that I have actually measured in my life, because when we look back in the historians like the great Nobel laureate of Martin Luther King, he said, "First it's civil rights." But what I see is, as we go further into the 21st century, it's going to be more about economic rights than civil rights. And his predictions are really, really true right now, wouldn't you agree?
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: We have some civil rights issues, but we have economic right issues that we have to be really be looking at very carefully.
Speaker 1: Yeah, concern for the poor is still, you know, is becoming increasingly important. (unclear) (simultaneous)..
Speaker 2: Yes, and we have to--.
Speaker 1: Not that it's ever diminished. I think people don't emphasize the economic condition of the people that don't have, you know, and how they can change that.
Speaker 2: You're absolutely right about that, Larry. And I think we need to have a balance of those on the demand side as well as those on the supply side. That's part of the reason why I wrote my book, because that's--I was--LaValle asked me, he said when I got finished with Wharton and Chicago, he said, "Oliver, how many of us was in the class with you?" And I said, "Six. Three were from African nations, and there three from African-Americans." And I remember him sitting there and looking at me and saying, "Yeah, yeah. I thought so." And he was one of the Raggedy-Five. And he said, one of the major corporations, he was at one of the major corporations of America, Procter and Gamble [Cincinnati, Ohio]. So he was, really he was saying that we need to have more of us in that room understanding high finance and commerce so that we can share that literacy with others in our community as fast as we can. One of the things I remember taking in Chicago and at Wharton was "Options and Derivatives." "Advanced Options and Derivatives." And what I found so interesting, Larry, that the math behind it--there was only five people in my class. None of the business majors would take it. And the reason was, there were too many integrals in the class. It was physics. It was mathematical physics that is driving financial derivatives and options. So banking is not the rocket science of banking. I write about this in my book. At one time, it was pluses and minuses, and assets and liabilities and balance sheets. But then behind that is alternative investment, and what drives that on these fast computers and this advanced technology is rocket science math. So what I learned at the MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] gas turbine lab, when you translate that thermodynamics into the economics of money, guess what? Instead of thermodynamics, it's econo-dynamics. I'm writing about that.
Story_ID: 626217
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done to this point, again, because we talked about legacy, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you go back and change something?
Speaker 2: Wow. Fascinating question. I'm giving hat some careful thought. (pause). No. Except I would love more.
Speaker 1: Okay. In terms of that, I mean, that kind of leads into another question. Tell us about your family today. Now, who would you consider to be your family, and are you--your brothers--you still got your sisters and your cousin, I guess, and are your parents still--your mother's still with us, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother [Jean Arnold] is still living. My father [Oliver George McGee, Sr.] is still living.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: God bless them. Rose died. Which was a big loss for me. Most of the rest of the family is still living. All of the siblings and they are 23 grandchildren. The Wise family, and the Ersick (ph. splg.) family, and the Wagner family. I've held every single one of them in the first six months of their life. I'm known as Uncle Oliver, and I think everyone should have another family that has adopted them. It well rounds you from a different demographic in your life, because it opens you up to different--these are farmers. I'm a city boy. Right. So, it allows me much, much more empathy. And I have enjoyed the relationship with that family as long as--as much as my own. My Uncle Yogi, Aunt Debbie, their little guy Brandon, who is--I wrote a letter for him at Christmas to get into Avon Lakes Boarding School, and they tell me my letter has--they had a major impact of him being accepted. He is now on the path of 13 years of concentrated, well-trained education, charter school. I have my hopes he'll get into Yale [University]. And that's--and I have my close friends. My one dear friend I just recently lost I had for 25 years.
Speaker 1: Do you want to tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Oh, he just had a car accident, and the tire rod on his front wheel broke and he ran into a bridge. So what that has done is opened me up to--you have to live your life in the moment. And when this request came, I said, you must do it now. You must tell your story as honestly and humbly as you possibly can, and because you--life is about now, and to be able to do the best you can to get back is ultimately--when I shared with you, Larry, that I want to love more, giving is loving more. I think that's the life lesson that I've come to learn. I'm enjoying this interview because it is--I'm at peace and so relaxed, and my friend, my best friend, Larry, he said, "One day, you're going to be telling your story, and I can't wait until you do it." And when I get this video, he's going to get it, and he's going to go, "Oliver, you finally told your story." I hope I did good, Larry.
Story_ID: 626218
Speaker 1: Now, just for the sake of--can you name your books for us--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the order that they come? Because, just for the record here.
Speaker 2: I have six books out. "Jumping the Aisle: How I Became a Black Republican in the Age of Obama," rhetorical question. Bleeping America. It's really a fine book in the age of Obama. "Bridging the Black Research Gap." "Confessions from the Balcony," is the primer that I'm talking about academic administration in predominantly white institutions, and being a young, the first African-American to meet in academic roles. I felt that when I came into the job, there was not a primer or to-do list or whatever, so I said, "I've had an opportunity to serve as an academic department chair, talk about your experiences," it's a how-to. You know, it's some things that I experienced and something that might and useful for people to read who weren't thrust into that role when more are going to be. "Bridging the Black Research Gap," is about research capacity building at HBCUs, with George Ayers and Dr. Earl Richardson, Morgan State University. And we were able to put together with Calvin Butts at SUNY, a commission for the "Future of African-American Men and Boys," and talk about education and health and social issues, and so forth about what is the future of African-American men and boys. It was sort of like put together like the "Race Document," meaning the American thief or scientific technological challenges of the 21st century. So that's the proceedings on that. And then I have a book on "Transforming the Ivory Tower," on strategic planning in the universities. Those are my books.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 626219
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything we have not touched upon that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No. I think you've done a wonderful job in tracing through the path of my life. I think, as I was sharing with you off camera, that this is a wonderful process of how you have me very relaxed and just talk my life, and this was a great conversation, fully authentic. And I enjoyed that. It's just that there's something liberating in being authentic.
Speaker 1: Okay. Alright. Well, thank you. The last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (pause). That I made a difference in each person's life that I had an opportunity to walk alongside; that is, a result of knowing them and empathizing with them, and then working with them, it made a difference, in a small way. Ultimately, I think that's what we do in each other's lives, is we make a difference, and that I tried the best to my ability to be authentic. And integrity is a very, very tough ongoing challenge in life. This history making video is about integrity, and that I tried to the best of my ability to uphold that, because that's something you have to work with and think about every day. Not concentrate on them, because oftentimes when you're authentic and just being yourself, you're full of integrity. But these words are things that I say in my website. They are self-expression. But, ultimately, it's about making a difference. And you have to think about that. And so, I hope, you know, I'm making a difference in the stem fields, making a difference in the literature that I write and leave behind. And I have a house full of books that you been seeing. They are all my absentee teachers. So, this is my opportunity to be an absentee teacher. And that's making a difference. Writing is a privilege. Reading is a privilege. And I hope I'm making a difference in that in being a reader and a writer. Speaking on this series is a privilege. And now only am I listening to your questions, but I'm listening to myself. That's a privilege.

Speaker 1: This is a picture of my father, Oliver George McGee, Jr. We're at, that's on the left, and in the middle is me, Oliver George McGee III, and on the far right is my sister, Brenda McGee. It's taken about September 1962 which would make me about five years old and my sister four. And we're in front of our old house, 2311 Burnett Avenue in Cincinnati, Ohio. It's taken by my mother.
Speaker 2: There you go (laughs).
Speaker 1: This is a great picture from--we took it the moment that we got--that's my friend on the left, Moxicillin (ph. splg.), and myself. And we're at--outside of the Nobel Foundation, and he had just--he was a part of the Stockholm City Council, and he got me a personal, private visitation to the actual where they did give the Nobel Prize, and I was standing in the spot where the King Sweden gives the Nobel Prize.
Speaker 2: About what year is that?
Speaker 1: That was 1996.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This one is my very first day as drum major at the Ohio State Marching Band. My mom, Geane Wilson is on the left, I'm in the middle, and the far right is my teacher, D. Feltzer, Reynoldsburg, Ohio; Columbus, Ohio. She taught me and Dwight how to do what we do in that uniform. She was a phenomenal teacher. This is the gold medal that is in my house, given to my stepfather who earned in the Tokyo Olympics in 1964, and he was on the Olympic Gold Medal Winning Basketball Team with Bill Bradley and John Hafashack (ph. splg.). This is me at the Arizona State game, Arizona State versus Ohio State game in 1980. And I am actually doing the traditional backbend for--in front of 100,000 people. We have to put the (ploomb?) on the ground to signify that we're going to win the game, and that was an in-zone shot of me doing that. Here's a legacy of drum majors at Ohio State with the great Dwight Hudson's on the far left. In the middle is future drum major in 1984, Bruce Hart. And there's me as assistant drum major in my assistant drum major garb as Dwight's assistant. And I was a future drum major in 1980. This is my first day as drum major 1980, with my two sisters, Brenda on the left, and Sherri's in the middle. Sherri, me, Brenda and Sherri McGee. That's me in the uniform (laughs). We're having fun. This is my stepdad with a Bulls uniform as he was formerly a Bull. He's standing with the great Michael Jordan. He had worked with him and helped him to establish an NBA retirement fund for former NBA players' alumni. Of course, my stepdad was--he was also in the first Phoenix Suns team basketball, amongst other great--he was on 1961 and '62 [1962], NCAA champion with--
Speaker 2: With the University of Cincinnati?
Speaker 1: With the University of Cincinnati and--.
Speaker 2: George Wilson.
Speaker 1: George Wilson. And he went on to join the in 1964 the Olympic Basketball Team and won the gold medal. This is the day of my mom, Geane Wilson and George Wilson's wedding. They're cutting the cake, and in the foreground is Gerri Mannigan, who was my mom's best friend, and she managed the wedding. And we're on a boat riding, Larry, on the Ohio River. That's one of the few times I've been on the Ohio River (laughs). But I gave my mom away on that day. This is one of the best camping trips that I'd taken with my best friend, Randy Campasanto (ph. splg.) and his wife Regina, and their two kids, Jackie and Carl, and a neighbor friend and myself were up at 14,000 feet, mountains in outside of Denver, just enjoying the outdoors and some fishing. This is me and my old house on 1011 Little Pine Drive, 1490 Little Pine Drive. And with Betty Barrow on the left, who is--me and Betty were going to an event together, and we're--Betty Barrow is Dr. Julian Earls' other daughter, and I'm Dr. Julian Earls' other son. And we're both into (unclear) Dr. Earls. This is my picture that appears in the "Most Inspirational Bandsman" wall at Ohio State University. I was the most inspirational bandsman when I was drum major of the marching band. This is my mom with her dear friend, the great Oscar Robinson on the debut of his great book at the signing. And that was a wonderful day for both of them. Oscar is a warm friend of the family. This is me and my mom when I was named--received the William Oxley Thompson Award for alumni of Ohio State University. I'm at the age of 36. This is the great brochure that Dr. Martin Luther King Visiting Program, the inaugural of four recipients of that fellowship--of that professorship. It was created by a former president at MIT, Charles Vest, my mentor. And at the top of that is Wesley Harris, who is the department chair, department chair, L. Astro at MIT, and a member of the Academy of Engineering. And I'm at the bottom.
Speaker 2: (unclear).
Speaker 1: They're names in the brochure. One was in the mathematics department and one was in the--I forget the other department there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: These are great Ohio State football players who I've had an opportunity to mentor and advise, and on the left is Anthony Gonzalez. They were all three roommates. In the middle is the great quarterback. Ethici Gonzalez (ph. splg.) was all American (unclear) receiver. The middle is all American quarterback, Todd Beckman (ph. splg.). And on the right is Kirk Lukins (ph. splg.). Great linebacker. This me doing one of those ground bouncers at Wisconsin, 1980. I was in a middle of a featured number of a song called "Comona" (ph. splg.). And that's 32 degrees and snow. (laughs) It was cold that day.
Speaker 2: I always like it when it snows on that day.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. This is my mom at her high school graduation dance at 17 years old. And I'm just a year away.
Speaker 2: Did you get it?
Speaker 1: This is the traditional ramp entrance at Ohio State that we did at every game, and I'm doing the classic backbend and the same shop you saw before, but from afar, and you can kind of see the hundreds of fans there. And I'm--this is to prove to everyone that I actually touched the ground (laughs). Yeah, people always ask me, "Did you ever touch on the ground?" I go, "Oh, yeah." Look at there, there you go. That's just proof. I actually made it down there. Ask me if I can do it today. It's no way. This is one of the few papers in my family. This was given to me by my late grandfather, Oliver McGee, Senior. And I'm keeper of the family papers. This is the article, the Cincinnati Enquirer in 1964 when my father was named first black fireman in the city of Cincinnati. And--first black fireman. And he became a member of the Engine Company 32, and he is talking about me in there. He said, "McGee and his wife have four children, Oliver the third, 10; Brenda, 9; Sharon, 7, Maurice, 12, a nephew they adopted upon the death of the fireman's sister. The boys are looking forward to careers that require expensive educations. Maurice wants to be a lawyer, and Oliver hopes to become a physician. (laughs). So, I'm the keeper the papers on that one. This is a picture that was taken by the great Clinton photographer, Sharon Farmer. And I didn't know she took this picture. Clinton had called me over when we were at the President's radio address, and I--when we got that, and I was shaking his hand, my mom is observing us shake the hands. I said, "Every boy should grow up and have his mom witness him shaking hands of a sitting President. That's amazing."
Speaker 2: Sharon Farmer's a HistoryMaker.
Speaker 1: Yeah. She was wonderful. And this is when we were all together. On the left is Tom Wagner, and next to him is his late wife, Rosemary Wagner, who helped me to write my letters for the White House Fellows Program. There's me standing next to old Bill Clinton. And we're almost look like we're wearing the same ties there. And I was very surprised at how tall he is, and we're relatively the same height. And then my mom and then--Geane Wilson and George Wilson. Incidentally, this picture is historic. This is on the Friday, we're having a radio address on the Friday before the Tuesday in which he was acquitted from the Senate for impeachment. The following Tuesday he was acquitted for impeachment. So this was a--it was stressed day he was in. He was trying to go through that and waiting for that, the vote from the Senate, but I'm very happy about that picture because it's historic, Clinton's presidency was saved there.
