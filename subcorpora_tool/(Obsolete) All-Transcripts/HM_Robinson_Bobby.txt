And he asked me, "Would I like to play on that team?" I told him, "I would."  And so he told me, "Next spring," he said, "I'll have you go to spring training camp."  And that's the way I got started, you know.

Speaker 2: No, if a team--Other words if a team wanted you, well they would pay you whatever you agreed to play for.  And that's just the way it was.  You know, if they agreed to pay you a certain amount--well whatever amount it was,  when the time come to get paid,  well then they pay you that amount.  That's the way it was in them times.
Speaker 1: But what about the part where the students or the--the men that you played with actually sat down with you and taught you, you know, how to write, how to do math--

Speaker 1: And--But there were people--I'm sure there were some of your baseball comrades or baseball whatever--teammates that they would not--Were they working also brick--?
Speaker 2: No I--As a matter of fact, I think I was about the only one that I knew that was laying bricks, you know.  The only one that I think that I know.
Speaker 1: So that made you--
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) The other guys did something else.  I was a lone wolf of the woods (laughing).
Speaker 1: So when you retired--But that's what I'm saying.  Was he living in St. Louis when he retired?
Speaker 2: He was living in St. Louis, you know, playing in St. Louis when he made the decision.  Then he went back home.  And he had the skill of bricklaying.  And from that he came to Chicago looking for work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was able to get work.  And so he came here.  And then moved the family from there to here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yeah, that's the way it was.
Speaker 1: So he retired as a bricklayer.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So when you came to Chicago this time, 'cause you had played here before.
Speaker 1: Oh I had played here, yeah.
Speaker 2: But you had given--You know, you were no longer playing.  Did you miss the game at all sir?
Speaker 1: Yes I sure did.
Speaker 2: Did you ever think about--?  You know, you see Michael Jordan.  You see he's retired twice.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was reading about him the other night I was reading about him.  Said he retired.  Yeah, I thought he--no I don't know what happened to him.  I thought he had retired once before.  Right?  That's what I thought.  I don't know, they move around so.  You don't know hardly what they do.  To tell you the truth.
Speaker 2: Did you ever think about getting back there after you retired and getting out there and doing that?
Speaker 1: No not when I retired this last time I didn't.  Sure didn't.  I had enough.  And I meant that I had enough.
Speaker 2: Did you ever coach any Little League baseball teams and things like that?
Speaker 1: That I never did.

Speaker 2: No I sure didn't.  I always felt if they didn't want to play.  They didn't have to play.  You know, they could do something else.
Speaker 1: And so your life here in Chicago [Illinois] was that mainly as a bricklayer?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now you made a good living that way?
Speaker 2: Yes I did.
Speaker 1: Now was it hard.  This is 19--what '45 [1945] that you came--around that time?  Or was it around 1945 that you came to Chicago?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: No I sure don't really.

Speaker 1: (simultaneously) That's--
Speaker 2: He was in the bricklayers union for fifty years.
Speaker 1: That is amazing.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So let me ask you--So--Okay--I mean--
Speaker 2: He was just as skilled at brick laying as he was at baseball.
Speaker 1: As he was at--Right.  So now, can I ask--? So did your family--?  Did the--your brother-in-laws also come here to Chicago at the same time?
Speaker 2: My wife [Bernice Robinson] always went where I went.
Speaker 1: But your brother-in-laws, the ones who taught you bricklaying.  They stayed in Alabama?
Speaker 2: Sometime they did.
Speaker 1: Did they ever come work here in Chicago?

Speaker 1: No I'm talking about your brother-in-laws.  The other bricklayers.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: They never came?

Speaker 2: I don't know.  But lots of 'em.
Speaker 1: Lot's of them?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And where would you mainly work?  Would you work--?  What projects did you work at?
Speaker 2: Different places, different cities, you know.
Speaker 1: As a--
Speaker 2: At first--
Speaker 1: I--I'm--

Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Oh okay.
Speaker 2: He and my brother.  And then he settled here in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But at first they traveled.

Story_ID: 19604
Speaker 1: Why do you think baseball is such a great game?  Why was it something that you--? Why do you think it's a great game?
Speaker 2: Well I think if a person like it.  You know, like the game, and wanna put enough in to it.  Why I think he should like it.  He can like it just like he like anything else, you know.
Speaker 1: But why--?  You like it better than basketball and football, right?
Speaker 2: Maybe just because I love it better.
Speaker 1: And why--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) I put it like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, and why do you like it?
Speaker 2: I don't know why.
Speaker 1: Okay then.
Speaker 2: (laughing).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Really [chuckles].

Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: The large size helps with holding--Okay.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) I think so.
Speaker 1: Sir, let me--When you look back over your life, when you think back.  'Cause you--We were talking earlier about the fact that, you know, here it is 2001. And when you were born in 1903, you never probably thought you would be sitting here, in 2001, and you're in really good shape and health.  I mean I, you know, I look at you and I marvel, you know, 'cause you look like you're in your sixties.
Speaker 2: A long way from it though.

Speaker 2: In what way?
Speaker 1: Well just in any way that you would.  I mean--You know, if you said, "When I look back over and I'm sort of a--"  You know, whatever how you would fill in.

Speaker 1: And what--?  Do you have a legacy?  Do you want to leave a legacy, sir?
Speaker 2: Huh?

Speaker 2: Well I don't know.  I don't know about that.
Story_ID: 19607

Speaker 2: I think Jackie was a nice person.  I do.  Nice, intelligent.  That's what I think.
Speaker 1: Are there any--? Do you watch baseball now?
Speaker 2: Well not like I use to.  I don't watch like I use to.
Speaker 1: But when you watched it--When you had stopped playing and you were watching it, were there other, you know, ballplayers that you admired?
Speaker 2: Yes it was.  Yeah, there were some ballplayers like that.
Speaker 1: Who?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  You know, it's hard to remember back--remember all--

Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Was his father--?  Was he better than his father?
Speaker 2: I guess--Let's see. [Pause] I guess Billy was.  I guess he was.  To bring it down to--
Speaker 1: I just have a couple more questions--
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And we're gonna do your photograph.  But I wanna know, you know, when you think of the Negro League baseball players and their role in history.  What do you think about that?  His--You know, the role that the Negro Leagues played.
Speaker 2: What do I think about the role they play?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: Well in what way?
Speaker 1: Well just in terms of the role they played in history.  Their role in history.  Like, you know, remember as you were--Look at the medallion you're wearing.  You know, your awards.  You're getting honors right now. You know, people are wanting to acknowledge--Well it's not just right now.  But over the last few years.  You know, people are coming out with Negro Baseball League, you know, shirts and, you know, pens.  And, you know, you have the museum [Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, Kansas City, Kansas].  But I'm just wondering what role--? Because baseball is considered the greatest American pasttime.  It's been considered, you know, a great American sport. And I'm just wondering, when you look back, you know, what role do you think the Negro Baseball League players had in history?
Speaker 2: Well I think they had it pretty good really.  To tell the truth about it.  You know, different sports and what not.  Whatever they retired at.  I think they done pretty good.
Speaker 1: Did you end up getting your pension sir?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: Do you get a pension? There was--
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Well--
Speaker 1: From major league baseball.
Speaker 2: Yeah I understand what you talking about.  Seem like to me I did get a pension once. A year or so ago.
Speaker 1: So but what do you consider the one--Like they say 1947 was the cut off year.  Someone told me that.  Between what someone would consider an actual legitimate Negro Baseball League player.  'Cause they're only how many of you left now?
Speaker 2: I really don't remember tell you the truth.
Speaker 1: But there--
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) I don't think it's too many.
Speaker 1: Not too many.  You--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, [Ted] 'Double Duty' [Radcliffe].  They're only about five--six to seven.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) It ain't too many.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  But it was a lot of talent that the Negro Leagues had, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And why do you think they were so talented?
Speaker 2: Well because they was.  That's why, really.
Speaker 1: And why do you think made them so good?  Why--I mean besides talent.  You think 'cause people played a lot.  You know, and they practiced a lot.  Or--
Speaker 2: Well I don't know really.  Tell the truth.
