Speaker 1: So I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Duronza Reeves] side, but we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Vada Louise Swanson [Vada Burrell Swanson], V-A-D-A, L-O-U-I-S-E, S-W-A-N-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: June 18, 1924.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And Toledo, Ohio is where she was born.
Speaker 1: Okay, now tell us what do you know about your--oh was your maiden--your mother's maiden name Swanson?
Speaker 2: My mother's maiden name is Burrell.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's what--yeah, I'll make that point.  Okay, 'cause I know she's [HistoryMaker] Charles Burrell's sister, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sister, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right and well, tell us what you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  I think this is like most of your family history, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: On this side (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) On my mother's side, my grandmother was born here in Denver, Colorado.  Her father--my grandmother's father was a minister of the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church.
Speaker 1: Your grandmother's name (unclear) name?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry, my grandmother's name was Denverado Howard [Denverado Howard Burrell], that's her maiden name.
Speaker 1: Is there a story behind the name?  I think we asked your uncle, but--?
Speaker 2: I think it's just because they were here in Denver, Colorado and they named her after--and she was born here.  I think she was the first and onl-, first one born.  The only one born here and they named her Denverado, that's what I heard.
Speaker 1: It's a very unique name, so that's why I wanted to ask.
Speaker 2: And Denver for short.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, and so she was born in 1898 to Joseph Perry [ph.] and Kate Howard [ph.], and her grandparents were Roscoes, Mary Roscoe [ph.], and I do not know my great-grandfather's name right off.  I'd have to go back--I know that we have it, but I don't remember it.
Speaker 1: Okay, and they--now, the Roscoes lived in--were you telling me Kansas earlier?
Speaker 2: No, the, the Howards lived in Kansas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was my grandm- that's where a lot of the kids were born in the Kansas area, but I do not know where my grandmother's parents were from (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, but do you get a sense that they were migrating from like a southern state into--well, not to Kansas that much north, but (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'd heard, yeah I, I do, but I don't know exactly where from.  My grandmother's p- mother--I don't, I don't remember specifically where she was born.  I don't know that, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so, the place that we can identify that, I guess the last--I mean the closest place for an origin would be Kansas right now, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 520453
Speaker 1: And you were telling me that they had stories about Quantrill's Raiders and all (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, you say Quantrill's and I think she called it Quantro's [ph.] Raiders, and my [maternal] grandmother [Denverado Howard Burrell] told a story, if I can remember, I don't know which brother it was, but at one point she said it was something she called the Herod decree, or something 'cause Herod [Herod the Great] said that all, you know, male children be killed when Jesus Christ was born and so forth, but she said that at that time they were killing young boys and that one of her brothers was actually raised with long pig tails and a dress in, for the first I think seven years of his life.
Speaker 1: Okay, and Quantrill [William Quantrill] was a--he was a Civil War renegade basically--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --who rode with Nathan Bedford Forrest, I'm just putting this in frame(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --for those who are watching this.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Rode with Nathan Bedford Forrest during the Civil War, Forrest being one of the first officers of the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] when it was formed in Nashville [sic. Pulaski, Tennessee] you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Years and years ago, so, I mean and they had a reputation of destroying black homesteaders' property and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, yeah, this is remarkable, I was excited to hear that kind of story, and she called 'em Quantro, huh?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Quantro's Marauders, yeah.
Speaker 1: The only reason I call him Quantrill is 'cause I know how his name is spelled (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).  Exactly.
Speaker 1: In those days, you wouldn't know it, but you--yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, exactly.
Story_ID: 520454
Speaker 1: So this is interesting, so they- they're in Kansas, but they moved from Kansas to--?
Speaker 2: They ended up coming to Colorado where my [maternal] great-great grandfather was minister at Shorter A.M.E. Church [Shorter Community A.M.E. Church, Denver, Colorado].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So was he the first minister in the family?
Speaker 2: No, he--but he was one of the first minsters at the--you mean first minister in the family (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In the family, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Two, you know I, I--yes, I'm not sure because I'm thinking that my [maternal] grandmother's [Denverado Howard Burrell] grandparents, her grandfather was a minister as well.  What denomination, I have no idea.
Speaker 1: It's interesting (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Cause when I look at the pictures of them and you know the pictures that I have of my great-great-grandparents, they look like they, you know, had a certain kind of status, so.  I'm thinking that maybe they--that he was a minister, I'm not sure.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) Your grandfather was a minister at an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church right?  In--
Speaker 2: Yes, great-grandfather.
Speaker 1: Great-grandfather, right, A.M.E. being the oldest black denomination they say.  Yeah, so, all right, so--now they moved from Kansas to Denver [Colorado], and then don't they move to Texas or some point too?
Speaker 2: They were in Texas, I really don't know all of that history.  I, I really--you know because some kind of way I think that they were in Texas because my grandmother was married at a very, very young age and she was married in Texas to my [maternal] grandfather [Reuben Burrell], who were Burrells from Texas as well.  They came out of a town [Shepherd, Texas] outside of Houston, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And so at some point your grandmother moves to Detroit [Michigan], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, my grandmother and my grandfather moved to Toledo [Ohio] first because I guess for whatever--jobs were available, they ended up--my grandfather ended up going there and he--then, they had--there were three I think of my mother's [Vada Burrell Swanson] siblings that were born in Toledo, the youngest two I believe were born in Detroit, so I don't know the specific dates of when they were born, but that's how they ended up, end up going to Detroit.
Speaker 1: Okay, I just wondered if they were assigned a church in Tol- (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, this is my grandmother and grandfather so, they're, she's now, there's no more people who are ministers--I mean that she wasn't a--my grandfather wasn't a minister, but he worked and he ended up going--they ended up going to Detroit.  They were, they ended up migrating out of Texas to Detroit--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --via Toledo, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay, and Toledo's about sixty miles away?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, exactly.
Story_ID: 520455
Speaker 1: Did your [maternal] grandmother [Denverado Howard Burrell] have any stories about Detroit [Michigan] that she shared with you (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, you know they always talked about, you know, they lived in neighborhoods where there was--I remember them talking about there was people from Poland, from Germany, you know, very, very mixed neighborhoods.  So, it wasn't like the quote unquote black neighborhoods, so that, that I found very interesting and the way that they talked about the way they lived, I thought they were wealthy because the stories that they told of the people in the neighborhood, the man down the street, the dog named Pat the Killer [ph.] the--all of the stories of their childhood sounded so rich, and so one day I asked my mother [Vada Burrell Swanson], I said, "Wow, what color were your walls?" and, you know, "What did you paint your--," (laughter) you know, when I was young, I was like, "What did it look like?" and they laughed.  She said "We had a chair in the living room with a rug that was, you know, half gone because we danced on it so much, and four or five of us would sleep in the same bed," and there were eight siblings altogether.  So, you know they lived in a kind of housing project and my uncle [HistoryMaker Charles Burrell] used to talk about how they would go and meet the, the railroad car somewhere, like two miles away, jump on the top and kick the coal off and then go back down and collect the coal and use it.  You know, so they lived it, and then my mother talked about as a child how she would navigate, you know, being in these communities because you know sometimes that they would want to fight her and she knew that there was a German girl and a Polish girl and they had, you know, their, their ethnicities had some kind of rivalry, she would always pit them against each other and she said, that's how she survived.
Story_ID: 520456
Speaker 1: And then she went to Cass Tech [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan], and she talked about when she was in school there was a--what is the?  Oh god, she was the--a sister sh-, that she used to wear Bavarian hat, this Bavarian teacher, she sp- taught English and she was a sister of--what is the child that was--they started with an L.  God, I can't believe I can't remember this.  Are you editing this (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No, no, we, this--she's a child of somebody who--?
Speaker 1: That were--the, the Lindenbergs [ph.].
Speaker 2: Lindbergh?
Speaker 1: Lindbergh, Lindbergh.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, no, was it Lindbergh?  No, that wasn't the name (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Lindbergh [Charles Lindbergh] was a pilot, and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway she said there was, she was, and she told them that when she got into the English class that even if you make an A, I will not give any Negro in this class an A.  So, my mother [Vada Burrell Swanson] took somebody else's class for English.  So, she just, you know, talked about how she navigated, you know, all of that coming up as a kid, the racism and, you know, 'cause we wondered well, you know these, this is during the Jim Crow period, how did you deal with that, and you know they just, that was the reality of their life and they just knew how to navigate those waters.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that--that's the east side of Detroit [Michigan] I think 'cause I remember (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: --yeah from--Hastings Street--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and all that they talk about, yeah. So, now did your mother--I know your uncle [HistoryMaker Charles Burrell] had a chance to go to Wayne State [Wayne University; Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Did your mother go to school?
Speaker 1: My mother went to school for nursing later on and then she ended up getting her nursing degree and later on I think, right after that married my father [Duronza Reeves].
Story_ID: 520457
Speaker 1: And your uncle, I don't know if we, we've--he's [HistoryMaker] Charles Burrell, he's a musician, a jazz musician (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He's a--yeah, he's a--
Speaker 1: --and a classical--
Speaker 2: Yes, and her brother.
Speaker 1: --bass player.
Speaker 2: Yeah, was her brother and then her brother, Joseph Burrell, who still resides at ninety-six years old, ninety-four, I'm sorry, ninety-four years old in Detroit [Michigan] was the first African American lieutenant of the fire department.
Speaker 1: That's something, you know, I didn't remember hearing this story, but that's, that's something--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So he's still alive in--?
Speaker 2: He's still alive, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your uncle, he passed maybe--
Speaker 2: No, my uncle's still here, too.
Speaker 1: Is he still--Charles?  Okay (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah have, they live long, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, good, good.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so there's four them left, I'm sorry three of them left.  My aunt Mary Beth [Mary Beth Burrell Mitchell], who was the youngest and now her two brothers.  My mother [Vada Burrell Swanson] was the last one to make their trans-, her transition, which was four years ago, yeah.
Story_ID: 520458
Speaker 1: Let me to go your father's side of the family, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's name is Duronza Houston Reeves [Duronza Reeves], D-U-R-O-N-Z-A, H-O-U-S-T-O-N, R-E-E--V as in Victor--E-S.  He was born in July 1922, July 7th, 1922 and he was born in Social Circle, Georgia, and I don't know a lot about the Reeves side of my family.  My father died when I was two years old, and I, I know some of them, but m- I know more about the Burrell side of my family.
Speaker 1: Okay, well is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: My mother [Vada Burrell Swanson] just said--I don't know how they met, but I know that he thought my mother was very beautiful, and my mother had very full lips, and she talked about one time they were down at Hudson's Department Store [J.L. Hudson Department Store; J.L. Hudson Building] in Detroit [Michigan] and she was always, you know, teased about her, her lips, and she said my father bought her the reddest lipstick that they had and told her to wear it because her lips were beautiful.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I love that story (laughter), yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, what was he like, what are the stories about him that she tells?  Or what do you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, she told me that he sang, and I know that he was in the armed services [U.S. Armed Forces], and one of his good friends used to tell me how beautifully he sang.  I heard that there was a recording of him singing, but I never was able to get it from the Reeves family, but she said he had like the voice of an angel.  As a child, I remember--he was sick right after I was born, but I, I was about eight, a little over--almost two years old, I would say you know, maybe twenty months, and I remember him, you know.  I remember that when he walked in the door my feet left the ground and I never walked anymore, I was always in his lap.  And I remember little, you know, things of him being in the hospital and them pushing him in a wheelchair and me holding, you know, being held by my mother, but reaching out to act like I was, you know, pushing the wheelchair.  I just remember sitting on his lap, and I have a really wonderful picture of me sitting on his lap and then after that all of a sudden, one day he disappeared, and I guess well, I'm s-, I know that's when he made his transition and it was interesting because at that time you'd think that children don't remember things like that, but it was very vivid.  I have very vivid memories of him no longer being there and lots of dreams of seeing him and not being able to get to him, so I wasn't taken to his funeral, but from that point on, not understanding, of course, at almost two years old what death was.  I like looked for him everywhere.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now when--what did he die from do you, can, can--
Speaker 2: He had stomach cancer, a form of stomach cancer that was very aggressive, that's what my mother told me.
Story_ID: 520459
Speaker 1: Now, when you consider what you--the little you know about your father [Duronza Reeves] and his personality and what you've heard about him and what you know about your mother's [Vada Burrell Swanson] personality and looks and so forth, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, I know that I get my height from him. I'm pretty sure I probably get my voice from him, but my mother was a very courageous person and very forward thinking and very kind and generous of spirit, and you know I saw her work in the community as a nurse and raise generations of, of children as--she worked as a community worker, and so it was I think in a lot ways that has inspired my music more than anything.  My, my voice, my instrument is from my dad, but I think my voice really comes from my mother and seeing you know how she lived her life and the things that she did. Very wise person.  As a young person, I remember you know when some of my friends would be going through things.  I would say, "Well you just have to talk to my mother."  I thought you know she was like this person that could soothe everybody's you know, problems.  And all my life I saw people go to her and from--and all my life she never discussed what people told her.  So she held the secrets of a lot of people.
Story_ID: 520460
Speaker 1: How soon was it after your father [Duronza Reeves] passed that the family moved to Denver [Colorado]?
Speaker 2: Almost immediately after.  Now, we show up--I was born in 1956, I believe in 1958 is when we show up, like late 1958, we s- end up here in Denver, Colorado.  By that time my [maternal] grandmother [Denverado Howard Burrell] had moved here, she was remarried.  She was living in a mother-in-law's apartment underneath my aunt, my younger aunt, Mary Beth Mitchell [Mary Beth Burrell Mitchell], who was also a Burrell, and so the--a lot of the kids started to come and wanna be around her.  So, we ended up coming to Denver, Colorado to make a start.  My mother [Vada Burrell Swanson] is now, you know, widowed and looking for, you know, employment, ends up working at children's hospital here in Denver, Colorado, and my aunt worked for the, the Mountain Bell telephone company [The Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph Company], which is a whole other story (laughter), yeah.
Story_ID: 520461
Speaker 1: Now you have siblings right and--
Speaker 2: Yes, I have one sister [Sharon Hill-Washington].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my sister was born in Detroit [Michigan].  My sister and I are ten years and twenty days apart, and my sister ended up--when my [maternal] grandmother [Denverado Howard Burrell] moved here, my sister also was with us of course when we moved from Detroit here.
Speaker 1: Okay, she's older, ten years older than you, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay, so well there's just--in your household there's your aunt [Mary Beth Burrell Mitchell], your mother [Vada Burrell Swanson] and your two--your sister--
Speaker 2: Me and my si- we didn't live with my aunt, we came here and we ended up in an apartment complex on a street called Milwaukee [Street] and about 35th [Avenue] and I don't remember the address but we lived there, my mother was working at time.  Then we ended up moving in these apartments in here in Denver [Colorado] called the Dahlia Apartments, and I believe that by that time I was about five years old.  At seven, we moved on 5070 East 33rd [Avenue], and then my mother met my stepfather, William Swanson [William A. Swanson], and then we moved into a neighborhood, was predominately white and a lot of black people were starting to, you know, expand into Park Hill [Denver, Colorado], and the first house that I lived in was 3390 Pontiac [Street] in--here, in Denver, Colorado in Park Hill.
Story_ID: 520462
Speaker 1: Can you describe some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in Denver [Colorado]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, it was really interesting because where my aunt [Mary Beth Burrell Mitchell] lived over on Jackson Street, which was--a lot of things happened on Jackson Street because with my mother [Vada Burrell Swanson] working now, I stay with my [maternal] grandmother [Denverado Howard Burrell] and my grandfather at the time, Arthur Mobley, and in the backyard of my aunt's house she had peach trees, cherry trees, and apricot and rhubarb growing.  It was like a little farm, and she used everything that was out there.  We picked everything, she made wine out of the cherries that was extremely potent.  I've wat- we've watched them drink it (laughter), and you know everybody would be transformed, but she you know, believed at that time in you know very healthy food and so growing up it was nothing to go to the farm and you know get fresh chickens and eggs and stuff like that.  I remember as a kid, you know, I, I--the snow was a wonderful thing and this particular aunt was the one that was real daring and we went everywhere.  They used to have a big hill in City Park [Denver, Colorado] that was in front of the museum [Denver Museum of Nature and Science, Denver, Colorado], and she would take me and her two sons, Ivan Mitchell and Mark Mitchell, and we would play on that hill and we'd be the only black kids on the hill and she--all of them had no problem, you know, immersing us in, you know, in all the things that you know other kids were doing that maybe were outside of our neighborhood, but wanted us to feel comfortable in being out there and doing them.  So, I started ice skating on City Park lake when--at that time, it used to get cold enough that you could ice skate.  My Uncle Charles [HistoryMaker Charles Burrell] loved horseback riding, I learned how to ride horses because of him, and the mountains were available to us.  We went into the mountains a lot and played in the, you know, in the streams and lakes and fished and rode horses, and my uncle had a cabin in the mountains that we stayed in, and it was pretty extraordinary.  We felt like there was no place at that time that we couldn't go, so it kind of built us in a way, you know, to, to not be afraid, and I think that, that was another thing that inspired me artistically because with my mother and my aunt--with my family in general, there was no limit, you could always do whatever you know wanted to do and we went into these places, I remember later on we--there was a train that would take you up to this place called Winter Park [Winter Park Ski Area; Winter Park Resort, Winter Park, Colorado] for skiing, and it was a great train.  You know ,you'd get on it, and my aunt had me and my cousins, and I remember the train was full of, you know predominately white people--well, all white people, and we'd be the only black family with this one woman, who I thought was like ten feet tall, but turned--after I grew up I realized that she was only 5'4" (laughter), but her spirit was so huge, and she, you know, I remember them taunting us on the train and my--how my aunt stood up to them and, and I was of the age that I was like, well, can we leave our s- 'cause you leave all your stuff on the train, are they gonna take our stuff?  And my grandmother, my--I mean my aunt never cursed, but she would say hell or damn or something like that.  And she'd say, "Hell no, they are not gonna touch anything."  And she spoke with such authority and stood, you know, with such strength you know, we just felt like, okay, that's, you know, what we have to do.
Story_ID: 520463
Speaker 1: Once we moved here, I went to a public kindergarten, but then in first grade I ended up going to a Catholic school, Cure d'Ars Catholic School [Denver, Colorado], which the school no longer exists, but the church [Cure d'Ars Church, Denver, Colorado] still does, and the reason that I went there was close to where we lived, and it was also what my mother [Vada Burrell Swanson] thought was the best education that I could have as private school.  She paid for me to be there and it was a really interesting experience because I remember as a kid when, when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] passed away, my teacher, her name was Ms. Hovas [ph.], I remembered her standing in front of the class saying that it is a good thing that he is dead.  Now, black people will know their place.  Well, as a child you know you grow up with adults who are activists and very much a part of the progression of, you know, our lives, and you would hear them over your head, you know, and I knew that what this teacher was saying was incorrect, and I stood up and I told her that it was wrong and that, you know, he--you know in, in the best way I could why he was so important for us as a people and she told me to sit down, and I sat down and I, under my breath basically I called her a bitch, and I whispered it, and the girl in front of me stood up and told her that I called her a bad name and Ms. Hovas asked her to come to the front of the class and tell her what it was, and she whispered very loudly what I said, and I remember the kids in the classroom--at that time, you know, when you did something there was a shame thing that they would do and they'd go, "You, you, you" in unison, "You, you, you, you," and so Ms. Hovas grabbed me by my white shirt that I had on that went with my colloquial--Catholic school jumper and she--every time I would move, her nails were very, very thin and sharp and they would dig down into my arm, and by the time I got down to the principal's office, there were four marks of blood in my arm from where she had dug actually through the cloth of my cotton shirt into my arm, and the principal at the time, her name was Sister Dolorita [ph.], and sh- I remember her head sinking because she knew she had to call my mother, and she knew she didn't really to s- because my mother was very much a part of what was going on up there.  So, she called my mother in--I remember I left, I don't know exactly what my mother said, but I--when I returned to school the next week, Ms. Hovas was no longer at the school.
Story_ID: 520464
Speaker 1: You had another story to share with us about Catholic school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I remember when I was--it was time for me to take my First Holy Communion and we had to you know practice taking communion, you know, for the day to come, and the teacher that taught us wha- you know, we did our catechism classes and so forth, the teacher that taught us her name was Sister Cyro [ph.], and I remember, you know, she would tell us, we'd walk up and the priest will put the host in your mouth and you don't touch it, and so all the other kids walk up, but every time a black child would walk up for her to pretend like she was putting the host in her mouth, she would make this whole big old thing and wash her hands and wipe it all over her and so every time you know one of us would walk up, that's you know what we dealt with.  It wasn't until my last year there, I went there all the way to the sixth grade, that I had a Sister Genevieve [ph.].  The third grade teacher, Sis- Ms. LaGuardia [ph.] was absolutely wonderful and then my sixth grade teacher, Sister Genevieve was there and that was during the time that now 'The Singing Nun' has--there's a movie out 'The Singing Nun' the women of the church now, no longer have to wear the long habit you know, they wear shorter dresses.  They don't have to cover their hair and she was this like this really new, thinking person, white nun who you know somehow understood you know what was going on and was really someone that a lot of the students really respected because when things were not right, and it didn't--whatever little, you know fights or whatever, whatever--she had a way of sitting us all down and, and coming together in her way.  Coming together and talking about it.  So, it was a very peaceful (laughter) last year at, at Cure d'Ars [Cure d'Ars Catholic School Denver, Colorado], and I begged my mother [Vada Burrell Swanson] to please send me to public school.
Story_ID: 520465
Speaker 1: Now, when I get to public school, it is the first year of busing for--that was a--for me.  Busing had been--ha- busing had started I think in maybe--I wanna say '68 [1968], '69 [1969] something like that, and we were like maybe the second class to go, we ended up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So you were like twelve or thirteen, I guess?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we ended up going to the school Hamilton Junior High [Hamilton Junior High School; Hamilton Middle School].  Hamilton Junior High is located out in south Denver [Colorado].  At that time, you went through a farm land to get there and then there was a housing development--that was out, that was a newly hou-, a newly-built housing development that out there by this new school, and that's where we were bused to.  And it was interesting because at the time, you know we spent as kids, probably forty-five minutes to an hour on the bus getting to school, and you never missed your bus coming home, 'cause you didn't want your parents to have to come way out there and then deal with them as they asked you why you missed your bus.  So, you know the bus was our primary way to get there, our primary transportation, and at the time you know we didn't know really what we were walking into and there were kids that already lived there, and they didn't know who we were.  We only knew through parents, you know, no Facebook, of course, no--any of that.  So, we get out there and I think basically the students were pretty cool.  We were getting to know each other, all kind of, you know, different people from different backgrounds, different people from different financial backgrounds.  There was a lot of very upper middle class white kids that lived there and they had things and--that we had never seen before, and shopped in places that we never actually thought we could go in or what have you so, everybody you know was coming together and their tastes were changing and you know that was during the time when I realized that I wanted to sing.
Story_ID: 520466
Speaker 1: So at the time, the, the school was just seventh and eighth grade, ninth grade was the beginning of high school [George Washington High School, Denver, Colorado], but before I got out of there they did add a ninth grade.  So I was there at Hamilton [Hamilton Junior High School; Hamilton Middle School, Denver, Colorado] for three years.  The first year was okay, the second year, we were aware that we are going into history classes, and we are not being taught about slavery, and a lot of us had come from parents who talked about it and we wondered why, you know, nobody was talking about it, and if they did refer to it, you know, it was that we were happy, and that we, you know, did the jobs that were told for us to do and you know everybody lived in peace and harmony and we knew that that wasn't right.  So through that particular year--we had a black principal who was--I'm sorry, assistant principal, Mr. McGee [Lindbergh McGee] who was there, and I don't remember who the principal was at the time, but it was this white woman who was very unapproachable, and by the eighth grade there were a couple more African American teachers in.  This one teacher that I had, oh, her name was--is, Bennie Williams, and she's still very much a part of my life, and Bennie Williams came out of Texas, went to--I think she went to Bishop [Bishop College, Marshall, Texas], she taught there as well, and then she ended up here in Denver, Colorado and the racial tensions were starting to get strong because out in south Denver there were newspapers that referred to us as jungle bunnies and porch monkeys and you know we were starting to hear that among some of the white students you know, referring to us in this way, so we just--but there were a lot of white students that didn't feel like that, but we knew that we wanted to learn more about ourselves, so we decided you know 'cause we, we were looking at television and we're seeing you know, we're hearing the adults once again and we're just learning by example that we want (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is--yeah, it's kind of a time of a cultural revolution (unclear) the country--
Speaker 1: Yes, exactly.
Speaker 2: Black power era--
Speaker 1: Absolutely, all--
Speaker 2: The Black Arts Movement started up.
Speaker 1: Yes, my mother [Vada Burrell Swanson]--my aunt [Mary Beth Burrell Mitchell] especially was going back and forth to Detroit [Michigan], and the riots in Detroit had happened and there was all of this awareness in the music and so we decided that we would have a sit-in.
Story_ID: 520467
Speaker 1: Stage a sit-in that was a peaceful sit-in and it would come, it would happen fifteen minutes before the last bell so that we could sit-in for fifteen minutes, get on our buses that we needed to get on and go home.  And this was on a Friday, no, this was on a Thursday, so we're sitting in and we're you know saying you know and there's black students, white students, Hispanic, Native American students and we're saying you know we want know about ourselves, the real story about our history and we want people to know about--that's kind of how we described it and so at that--when the fifteen minutes came, everybody's looking at the clock, people just stood up and went out and we handwrote all of these little things saying that this is gonna happen and when.  So, it happens and we go and nothing happens at that point and so then the next day we return to school [Hamilton Junior High School; Hamilton Middle School, Denver, Colorado], this is a Friday, and when we get to school there's an announcement for all of the black students, only black students, to come to the auditorium.  So, we all go to the auditorium and they tell us what our place is, they tell 'em that they won't have any of this kind of you know demonstration and so forth and you know we go home we tell our parents.  I go back to school on that Tuesday, and by this time everything is you know just kind of out of con-, back to school on that Monday, everything is kind of out of control and there's, you know there's starting to be fights and so my mother [Vada Burrell Swanson] decided you will not go to school on Tuesday.  So, I did not go to school that Tuesday, we find out Wednesday that I was suspended for being in a fight on Tuesday, but of course, I wasn't there.  So, it, they--from what I understood I didn't see, they said for junior high school they actually had police there on that Tuesday walking down the halls with batons in hand, across the halls.  Walking down the halls to, you know, to--and beating kids.  So, then they decide that okay, they close the school and they said we're gonna have to have this huge meeting, we need the, the children from east Denver, Park Hill [Denver, Colorado], which was us.  The children who lived out there, and the black kids who lived out there near this, in this new housing development and they wanted people from each of these different groups to, to represent them.  So, I represented the students that came from the, you know that were bused in from Denver, Park Hill, and there was a girl Shannon Porter [ph.] who represented the black kids that lived out in that neighborhood and a white young man that I don't ha-, and I don't remember his name, and everybody was to stand there and talk about their experience at the school.
Story_ID: 520468
Speaker 1: So, I told them, I remember in my speech, I said I was tired of you know of hearing stories about what black person (laughter) served tea to George Washington as he was crossing the Delaware [Delaware River], and you know I remember I had an afro with my red, green and black little jumpsuit and was you know very, very committed and strong in the things that I was talking about and then they decided to have each of these students, the students meet with parents.  They put us in different rooms and the parents of these other--like it wouldn't be the parents from Denver [Colorado], it would be the parents from the area that lived--the people that lived out in the area we were bused to, and I remember (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, so the white parents?
Speaker 1: All the white parents, and here I was twelve, thirteen years old and I'm standing in front of these people and they are hollering and screaming and calling all kinds of names and I remember th- not--I remember standing there and kind of like disappearing because it was so loud and they were coming in my face, not touching me.  There was really no one there to--it was so wrong the way that they put this thing together (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nobody in the school [Hamilton Junior High School; Hamilton Middle School, Denver, Colorado] was there--
Speaker 1: There was no monitor.
Speaker 2: --to mediate?
Speaker 1: There to stop it and I'm standing there in f-, I think finally one of the teachers comes in and you know tells people this is a child, you know, but, but, you know, I'm explaining--trying to talk to them, not really getting any words out because they're mad and they're calling me these names that they said were written in this newspaper.
Story_ID: 520469
Speaker 1: After that I remember you know the rest of the school week, I believe that the school [Hamilton Junior High School; Hamilton Middle School, Denver, Colorado] was closed and we came back in.  At that point the--one of the history teachers is now teaching African American studies, and you know there's this, this energy, this--of, of trying to put all of these different things in order immediately after this riot, but the thing that was the most effective was the fact that--going back to Bennie Williams, she had a choral class, and it was an interesting place, an interesting experience because she knew the power of music.  She understood it, and she knew that when the kids that came into her class talked about everything, they--she was just the, the wise one, the person that you could go to.  The teacher that you could talk to and really tell you know whatever you know you call it childhood angst, but you know the darkness that you were dealing with, and she would listen, and she would find songs that were appropriate, and we would sing, and a lot of times in this choral class you know people cried, you know because not only were we dealing with busing, but there were young people who were dealing with things--white kids were dealing with things in their homes because once we got out there as kids, the only thing that we knew about at that time in terms of drugs was maybe MD 20/20 and, and marijuana th- those are the only thing--reefer, you know and that was the only thing that we knew existed, but we get out there, and they have everything.  All kinds of drugs that are pharmaceutical drugs that are sold on the, on the playground, and these are junior high school students, drug dealers, and they're, they're getting it from their high school brothers and sisters and it went--it was like LSD, marijuana--I remember they--there was this thing going around about this, this thing called blotter acid, I guess it was a piece of paper with, and they were selling it and it would be a dot on a piece of paper and kids would be walking around you know like they were out of their minds, and I mean all of this stuff existed.  We were--you know a lot of us were really, we were like unh-uh, scared of it, but it existed and I remember them--and my mother [Vada Burrell Swanson], being a nurse, she kept on her table was a physician's desk reference and you know she was always looking up stuff and when I heard about--they used to do these drugs, darvons, and I had heard that before and I looked it up and I recognized, this is like what they have at school, you know these little--they called 'em pink ladies, and I had to do a paper for a class about drugs and I remember they called me down and asked me, you know, "How do you know all of this about the drugs?"  And I was like, "Because it's being sold out in the, out, you know in the, on the school grounds, you know."
Story_ID: 520470
Speaker 1: Going back to this teacher, the--one thing that she did that was really amazing (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is Bennie Williams?
Speaker 1: Yes, Bennie Williams, going back to Bennie Williams, you know she taught us--
Speaker 2: She was one of the few black teachers there [Hamilton Junior High School; Hamilton Middle School, Denver, Colorado]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I think, altogether there might've been, let's see there was Mrs. Champion [ph.], she was, she taught gym and there was--I wanna, I want to call her Ms. Allen [ph.], but she married one of the teachers and his last name was Allen, that's why her name was Allen.  I don't remember what it was before, but it was like maybe four teachers that were black. And the thing was, she decided to put together a show where all of the students come together and she taught us, you know, the poetry of you know, of black poets, white poets, and what we did was we, we would learn the--Native American poetry--she just found all of this stuff and she would put duets together, black kids, white kids.  She was just trying to help us to have an ex-, a genuine experience of one another and where we come from and how much maybe we did have in, in common and it was really, really powerful because you know the music at the time s- was not hard to find songs to sing you know, so we could sing 'Ball of Confusion,' and or there was a song called 'Gotta Do Wrong Before They Notice Me' [sic. 'Seems Like I Gotta Do Wrong'].  There was just all kinds, 'I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free.'  It was all kinds of songs, and we put on this show and it ended up being a very healing experience for the school.  Everybody wanted into her class after that because you know it was such a powerful experience and we're, now, you know, she's teaching poetry and you know everything that she could possibly teach in a music class.  We were discussing lyrics and we're discussing history, everything, and that was all in this, this music class.
Story_ID: 520471
Speaker 1: So I left there [Hamilton Junior High School; Hamilton Middle School, Denver, Colorado], and I ended up going to another school, which--busing was still in existence.  By that time, everything was pretty relaxed, and I went to a school, George Washington High School [Denver, Colorado], and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, I'm gonna pause here--
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: --before you go any further, I just wanna ask you about, as you were growing up--now, we haven't covered the history of any--well, except for the chorus, but I read that your uncle kind of introduced you to a lot of the classic jazz singers?
Speaker 1: That was m- that started really in high school, and in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right, we're right on--
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry, let's talk about, okay, I'm s- let me back up a little bit.  Now, also what has happened, that's what was happening in school, but then I have my great aunt, which is my Uncle Charles [HistoryMaker Charles Burrell], my mother [Vada Burrell Swanson], their aunt, my [maternal] grandmother's [Denverado Howard Burrell] sister, who lived here in Denver, Colorado.  Her name was Katherine Miller [ph.], and she was an incredible pianist and entertainer and she--a lot of her brothers, her brother and one of her sisters, Ida [Ida Howard (ph.)], who passed away before I was born, they were also musicians, and they talked about you know the reason that they ended up--you know they used to talk about Og- what was is it, Ogden, Utah and all of these different places and I used to wonder well, how you know how, were they traveling, and her husband was one of the architects of the porters and waiters association (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Pullman porters.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, in Denver, Colorado, and so, it was because of, you know the train and where it stopped, they always were talking about Kansas City [Missouri], Chicago [Illinois], you know, Detroit [Michigan] and then you know, St. Louis [Missouri] and so the, their sister Ida was an incredible musician, used to play and do all this--worked in, in Louisiana, you know just, just everywhere.  Was very sought after and, so she was Ida Howard and her brother Willie [Willie Howard (ph.)] she talked about was a musician too.  I didn't know so much about him, but my aunt [Mary Beth Burrell Mitchell] who I had the direct exposure to, it was nothing to have you know she'd always have these incredible dinners, and she was a cook and that's what she did for a living, she cooked and she would always use her, her new, I mean her best china and silverware and so forth, that's how she's always set a formal table, made the most incredible food and we would eat and afterwards my Uncle Charles would play bass, and she played piano and she would sing all of this very risque music from, you know, Bessie Smith, and you know Ma Rainey and all of these you know artists of the time that she grew up listening to and she would teach me these songs, and I would sing them and do the movements and I learned how to shimmy and you know her friends you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, what did your mother think about the, the--
Speaker 1: Oh, it was just part of the family you know, because we were just all, 'cause the reality was I had no idea what these words were.  They were laughing because this was a lot of double entendre, you know, and so, I remember keeping these songs with me.
Story_ID: 520472
Speaker 1: You know, I guess we'll talk about--later on, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) These are songs, these are songs, Batch- 'Back Door Man' and 'Kitchen Man'--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and all that kind of stuff?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah all that kind of stuff, you know and s- I remember there was this--what was this, there was this one line, "I got the blues in my mailbox 'cause I ain't got no mail."  I had no idea what that was about, and "My Roman meal done gone stale," you know (laughter).  "I got the blues in my breadbox 'cause my Roman meal's gone stale," you know, so I would sing all of these words you know and she--and they would just laugh and I would just sing 'em and do the little dance and you know and everything, and you know, it's just--I would do it, that's and nobody still at that time looked at me as a singer, I just would do it 'cause it was fun, and I was mimicking them and then, but it was during that time in junior high school [Hamilton Junior High School; Hamilton Middle School, Denver, Colorado] of working with Bennie Williams, 'cause at the time I was taking piano lessons from her and that's when I really found out that I could really sing and when we did that talent show that I was talking about, I remember loving how it made me feel, this kind of freedom that I had never felt before and a kind of connection that I couldn't destri- describe and how it, it changed people in the audience.  I could see and feel that and I remember at that time when I was singing--Edwin Hawkins [Edwin Hawkins Singers] had the 'Oh Happy Day' album out, and there was a song on it called "Joy" ["Joy, Joy"]: "Behind every dark cloud, there's a silver lining," and that was the song that I would sing, and I remember I would get caught up in it when we'd do it in the, in the class, and this is one of the songs that even the students, we would all cry 'cause you know we're going through our stuff, you know, and I remember being on stage and I was so caught up and I--to this day, I sing with my eyes closed.  I sang with my eyes closed then.  I was so caught up, and Ms. Williams (laughter) was on the side of the stage and she'd say, "Raise your arms," you know, "Raise your arms."  I'd go like this (gesture) and then (laughter) you know I'd just be singing and she told me to raise my arms but it was coming from my heart, but my arms would stay there so long she's like, "Put 'em down," (laughter) and I'd put 'em down 'cause I didn't know how to--I felt it in another place, not my body, you know.  So my body was not responding at that time to the music, only my spirit, or my heart, you know, so it was just to stand up there and release.  So, it hadn't like really shut down in my body and then I would go, and then I would sing with my aunt [Ida Howard (ph.)] and my uncle [HistoryMaker Charles Burrell], and it was just fun and I would release, but the words meant nothing to me, so.
Story_ID: 520473
Speaker 1: Denver's [Denver, Colorado] got this rich tradition of black performance at Five Point [Five Points, Denver, Colorado]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the Rossonian [Denver, Colorado] and some of the other clubs--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) hotels and stuff and a lot of the big-time entertainers come through on that same railroad you know circuit, Chitlin' Circuit--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --they used to call it, to stop and play Count Basie and everybody.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And did you hear those kind of stories growing up in--
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.  As a matter of fact we had an aunt that worked down there across the street from the Rossonian at a liquor store, Aunt Thelma [ph.], and we, you know we'd have to go down there, down on the Five Points to pick her up and it was, it was--I just remember as a kid how, if--that was the closest thing to a New York [New York] experience because it was so lively and people were out and dressed and they were wonderful and then later on you know my dad [Reeves' stepfather, William A. Swanson] was--talk about you know seeing Billie Holiday and you know a lot of the other artists that had come through at that time, but I never saw them on the Five Points, of course.
Speaker 1: And you lived--you didn't live that close to the Five Points right, you're in like (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, nothing is far from--
Speaker 1: Far, yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, but actually during that time, I mean to get down there it was never more than seven minutes, you know, five to seven minutes, you know, from where we even lived, so yeah, you know, but you know but I think the Five Points when I--my mother [Vada Burrell Swanson] wasn't married at the time when I had exposure to the Five Points.  My uncle [HistoryMaker Charles Burrell] lived over on Downing [Street] at the time and which is like, like right around the corner from the Five Points area and so this was, probably when I was like five or six years old, that was my exposure then to it.
Speaker 1: So now ba- and from what I understand the area was jumping until, ah, maybe early '60s [1960s] or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: It's another victim of urban renewal?
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly, um-hm, so I was pretty young.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 520474
Speaker 1: Now I'm, I'm singing with my aunt [Ida Howard (ph.)], we're doing these things and then I'm, I'm at school and now I'm really singing and people are starting to kind of take notice of this ability, still studying with Ms. Williams [Bennie Williams], piano and had another teacher, a little bit later on that I studied piano from but worked on my voice with her.  She was my first voice teacher, and--
Speaker 2: Were you identified as a vocal talent? I mean by (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, by that time--after this particular school [Hamilton Junior High School; Hamilton Middle School, Denver, Colorado] s-, talent show or whatever, program that we put on, that was when I was known as a singer.
Speaker 2: But it wasn't until high school then?
Speaker 1: It wasn't until high s-, no, that was junior high school, but it wasn't until high school that I really started to pursue it. So, I'm in high school now at George Washington High [George Washington High School, Denver, Colorado].
Story_ID: 520475
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So George Washington High School [Denver, Colorado].
Speaker 1: So, I go to George Washington High School, and this high school's very interesting because this particular school at the time was in the middle of the Jewish community, and it was, it was a state of the art high school, it had a retractable floor over the swimming pool, in the language department there was German, Russian, Italian, French, Spanish, English and He- Hebrew.  They had a very strong musical theater department.  There was a--I found out later, I didn't even know there was an IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] lab that was available.  They had--all the most incredible equipment, you know in a gym that anybody could have like you know everything for gymnasts.  I took archery, and golf.  I studied Russian just because it was different and I wanted to do something different.
Speaker 2: This sounds like the Cass Tech [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan] of Denver.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  It had everything, and it had amazing art classes, science classes, you know it was just like something you never even, you know, I didn't even know that, that existed.  'Course I'd never been to high school, but I never at that--to that point, you know, but it was just--it was so much, and it had a choir that was the, there was one choir and then there was the concert choir, and you had to have a certain grade average to get in the concert choir and you had to audition to be a part of the concert choir.  So, now I'm in tenth grade there trying to find my way, and it doesn't really start happening for me until eleventh grade and--my junior year--and when I'm in eleventh grade now, my grades are you know in a place where I could be a part of--I auditioned actually to be a part of the concert choir, I'm accepted.  The concert choir also has another group called the madrigals, and the madrigals were this you know the elite singers and they did all kinds of classical works, madrigals you know and other kinds of works, and they competed against other schools.  There was in George--there was a--in Thomas Jefferson [Thomas Jefferson High School, Denver, Colorado] I think they were called McGregor's Beggars and you know so they did this you know whole thing and it wasn't until my senior year that I ended up being a part of the madrigals because you had to be in the concert choir first, and by the time I got in they were called the Madrilaires because now there's this jazz component being brought into the schools.
Story_ID: 520476
Speaker 1: But in my eleventh grade--was pretty extraordinary.  I had been working, I had been working in music, supporting myself mu- with music since the eleventh grade.  In the eleventh grade ended up joining, outside of school [George Washington High School, Denver, Colorado], a group we called the Mellow Moods.  It was a bunch of musicians from Denver [Colorado], we first started out as a trio and it was myself, a drummer by the name of Randy Baron [ph.] and a friend of mine who--what's his--oh, god--Floyd Walker [ph.] played organ and played the bass on the organ so we didn't need a bass player, and his mother was our manager, and we worked and we actually made money because my mother [Vada Burrell Swanson] said you know I--you know she bought me you know the things that I needed you know and sometimes the clothes that she picked I never, you know at this point I want something that's a little hipper, my tastes have changed.  So, I learned how to sew so I started making my own clothes, and when I started making money, I would be able to buy my own clothes and so I would you know shop at Fashion Bar and Neusteters [Denver, Colorado], which were like the elite stores of that time and, Neusteters later on had Fashion Fair makeup, which I thought was really, really cool so I would get that, but anyway singing and I'm a part of the concert choir and there's this guy by the name Dick Culver [Richard Culver] who heads the jazz ensemble, and the jazz ensemble is winning all kinds of awards in Denver and, you know, they're pretty amazing young musicians, very well taught and they played pretty progressive arrangements and I would go down there and tell him that I wanted to sing with the jazz band and he told me that I couldn't, but I would go hang down there anyway.  And he said, "We don't have singers in a jazz band, this is just for instrumentalists," and so he never you know he and he would say things like chick singers for the jazz band.  So, I had a couple of friends who were in the trumpet section and they would always invite me to come and just sit in the back with them.  So, I would like look at their music and follow it and you know just feel this and learn what I could learn sitting in on their class 'cause I didn't have a class at that time.
Story_ID: 520477
Speaker 1: By this time had you been exposed to the records of Sarah Vaughn and others?
Speaker 2: At this time my uncle [HistoryMaker Charles Burrell]--okay, yes--by this time my uncle is giving--he realizes that I'm very serious about this singing so he's coming over at the same time and he's bringing me the music of all these great instrumentalists as well as great singers, great jazz singers, and I'm listening to these records and then he'd come back the next week and we'd discuss certain things.  At the same time my teacher [Bennie Williams] from junior high school [Hamilton Junior High School; Hamilton Middle School, Denver, Colorado] is also giving me records to listen to, but records that are a little bit different because while my uncle would give me the mainstream of jazz, sh- we were listening to Nina Simone and we're talking about you know soulful things and how to read a song and what, what--you know like I would listen to--she'd have me listening to [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson sing 'Guess Who I Saw Today,' and then have me listen to Nina sing it and ask me, "What is the difference?" you know.  So, this is going on.  Underneath all of this I am also singing the music of the times, we're doing in my band of Mellow Moods we expand the band, now we have three horns, and the organ, bass, percussion, guitar and another drummer and we're doing major gigs.  We're doing the proms and the you know--
Speaker 1: Now, what comprised the contemporary music that you liked in those days of high school [George Washington High School, Denver, Colorado]?  This would've been 1972 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  It was Stevie Wonder, it was, of course, Ohio Players and Larry Graham, Funkadelic [Parliament-Funkadelic], it was--gosh, I had all these things written down too, the music of the day. Gosh, Chaka Khan was very much a part of that, so we were doing all of these you know musician's songs and we're kind of trying to do 'em in our own way as well, and also loved groups like Chicago, Tower of Power 'cause we had a horn section so you know we did that, and the songs.  I would do some of the Tower of Power songs and then I would you know like even then like improvise and you know with the horns, so 'cause I was sitting in the jazz band at school.

Speaker 1: So, there's all of this stuff going on at the same time and I always tell this story, you know so I'm in this choir and this particular year we are supposed to perform the Bach [Johann Sebastian Bach] 'Magnificat' for the city-wide choral program, and you're selected from schools around the city to be a part of this 150-voice choir and you learn through, you learn all your parts and stuff at your school and then you're selected to be in the choir, and it was a city-wide orchestra.  So, I'm doing this, I get selected to be a part of the city-wide choir, which was amazing and very prestigious and--but I'm listening to Sarah [Sarah Vaughan], and we're doing this Bach music and I have been told to sing "Quia Respexit," which is an aria from the piece, then I am, I'm listening to Sarah and I come across the album with Clifford Brown ['Sarah Vaughan with Clifford Brown'], where she sings "Lullaby of Birdland," and she does this improvisation and in the improvisation she sounds like, it sounds like Bach, the way she's approaching it.  It has this Bach-ish kind of feeling and so I thought it was really, really hip and, and I remember thinking gosh, you know, I'm sitting in with the high school band [at George Washington High School, Denver, Colorado], I'm not a part of them yet.  This is still the first semester of school, I'm doing this music with them.  I'm still singing with my aunt [Ida Howard (ph.)], now I'm trying to do some gigs with my uncle [HistoryMaker Charles Burrell] and I have this band [Mellow Moods], so it's all this stuff that's going on and I remember singing the song and it has this really beautiful descending line at the end and you know you give your emotions to and I remember changing it because--and improvising over it because of what Sarah did on "Lullaby of Birdland," and I knew it would fit.  And it was like--my teacher thought oh, my god you know, this is not gonna, you can't do that, you know and I would throw in new notes and she would just say, "Absolutely not," but when it came time to actually do it I did it the way it was written but, but it was amazing to have that kind of connection.  By this time, now, there's more you know talk about this young student, and the teacher Dick Culver [Richard Culver] is kind of pressured into somehow putting me in the jazz band.  He gives me a song, he said it's a blues, it's called 'Wrap It Up, I'll Take It' [sic. 'Wrap It Up'], but it doesn't have words.  I said, "Okay, I'll take it."  So, I wrote my own blues words to it, some of 'em were the words that I learned from my aunt, you know, Helen Humes, all that, you know everything, anything you know just putting it in and I'd sing "Wrap it up I'll take it, whatever you give me I'll make it, wrap it up you know I'll take it," and I'd you know would just--and now, they're like going oh, my god because now I'm asking for--because my uncle is teaching me how to view the music, how the structure and form of the music is and you know he'll say things like you know, you know, now, they sing the song now, she sings the melody and she now she's scatting a chorus, she's improvising a chorus.  So, I knew what a chorus was.  So, I told the teacher you know I want to improvise a chorus, you know, and he said, "Well, I'll give you a half a chorus."  I was like, "Okay," and I knew what that was and he was kind of amazed that I knew just little things like that and how to, because of my uncle, how to even tell the band what I wanted, how I wanted it to be, dynamics and at this time you know I'm studying with these vocal teachers, but at this time and, and still playing the piano, but mostly everything is by ear.  So, he's, now they're so excited that him and the other teacher that work with him, Mr. Bastion [ph.], now they're starting to write arrangements for me asking me you know what songs do I like and they're--and Sarah Vaughn for me was the singer that really helped me to navigate my instrument because hers was so big and it was so full of color and she did all of these things with it and I thought that was pretty amazing and, and how she did it and where she would put certain things you know.  And we discussed all of those kind of subtle nuances and things, my--between my uncle and Ms. Williams [Bennie Williams].
Story_ID: 520479
Speaker 1: I remember they gave me, there was an album that she [Sarah Vaughan] did, 'Michel Legrand and Strings' [sic. 'Sarah Vaughan with Michel Legrand'], and it was all Michel Legrand music, Alan [Alan Bergman] and Marilyn Bergman had written the lyrics to and they had "What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?" and I just loved that you know her voice starts off very, very (singing), "What are you doing," you know I thought that was like (singing), "the res-" and she you know it was just all this color in between and these chords, these harmonies were very sophisticated sounding and the notes that she would choose to, to change the melody with were very inside the harmony and I thought wow, this is so cool so I used to--I learned it verbatim and I remember they did this arrangement for me and I would sing the song, and my uncle [HistoryMaker Charles Burrell] said now, he said, "I've heard you sing this song many times," he said, "and you sing it just like the record, and you have to understand that you know maybe she did it in two or three takes."  He said, "I wouldn't think that Sarah needed any more than, you know, one to three takes and it was just to see which take was the best, all of them were good."  That's how he would talk about her.  He said, "But I can guarantee you that every take was different.  So, you can't sing it like her--now that you know how these harmonies are, now that you know what you're hearing, you make it your own," and so, I started trying things you know.  Everything from changing colors to you know to, to really learning the harmony so I could find other notes and so this was the beginning of, of kind of a living school, you know, and it was extraordinary because I have all of these outlets to do it in.  I have the classical outlet, I have my uncle's very traditional jazz outlet, I have the music that I'm growing up on and listening to and then my sister [Sharon Hill-Washington] has this other, very sophisticated taste, loves music and now I'm going to her house and listening to the music that you know people ten years older are listening to and it's very, very hip. And this is how I learned about [HistoryMaker] Jean Carne, because of my sister you know she has 'The Aura Will Prevail,' and it was in--backing up a little bit, it was in the tenth grade I had always heard about him, but it was in tenth grade that I meet my cousin, [HistoryMaker] George Duke, and he becomes this figure in my life so we're writing back and forth and talking.  When he comes to town I hear him.
Story_ID: 520480
Speaker 1: There was this club here in Denver [Colorado] called Ebbets Field, which was an extraordinary club downtown and it looked like a very small amphitheater, the artists were at the bottom, and it was like a ball field, and you would go, and I would hear you know all of these great musicians.  I heard my cousin's [HistoryMaker George Duke] electric band when he had it with Billy Cobham [The Billy Cobham-George Duke Band] there.  I heard Donny Hathaway there, all of these different groups are coming so now Denver has this live music scene and also clubs are starting to open up and musicians are coming through here so Blue Mitchell comes through Denver, and I meet him, he likes the way I sa- sing.  I didn't know who Blue Mitchell was, so I'm singing with him while he's living here in Denver.  He's a great trumpet player, and so at the same time now this other component with the big band and I'm in the big band and, and we win the city-wide competition that sends us to Chicago [Illinois] to a conference, the National Association of Jazz Educators conference, it later became international, but now it's defunct, but at the time it was very strong.  I think it was--just, it hadn't been around for very, very long and we were performing there and this woman hears me who runs the Wichita Jazz Festival, her name is Maxine Adams [Edna Maxine Biggerstaff Adams], and this festival is very, very--a powerful festival.  It has a strong educational component.  She hears me at this thing and she tells her friend Clark Terry that he needs to come and listen to me.  So, I go--I'm performing, Clark comes up to me, were talking you know.  My last name is Reeves, so he doesn't associate it with any Burrells, and so he says, "Please give me your phone number, I'll call your parents," or whatever, "and I'm gonna keep in touch with you," and I said, "Okay" and told him I lived in Denver, Colorado and at the time there was a, a jazz festival, s- they called it the Dick Gibson Jazz Party [Colorado Jazz Party] would happen every single year and this, this man, Dick Gibson, would bring all of these legendary musicians in and they would do different things.  This is all in the eleventh grade year [at George Washington High School, Denver, Colorado], and so I go home, and he's like stoked about me, and he's calling me and he said, "Do you have any you know recordings of you singing?"  Well, the first jazz standard that I learned is 'That's All.'  So, we go into a little studio and we record it and I give it to him.  He sends it to Columbia Records and John Hammond is calling me on the phone and I'm like, who is this old--you know I just am not getting the power of what is going on.  I give it to my parents [Vada Burrell Swanson and Reeves' stepfather, William A. Swanson] and they don't really, really know but you know later on I find out who John Hammond was (laughter), but it wasn't my time then, and--but Clark is still very much a part of my life.
Story_ID: 520481
Speaker 1: And then I tell him [Clark Terry] that I have an uncle that plays in the Denver Symphony [Denver Symphony Orchestra], his name is [HistoryMaker] Charles Burrell and he laughs because they'd been in the [U.S.] Navy together.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were out at, near Chicago [Illinois] at the--I wanna call that station out there--it's in north Chicago--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --wherever they--yeah--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --the famous jazz band, [HistoryMaker] Samuel Floyd is one of the curators of that music.  I think he had the Center for Black Music Research at Columbia College [Columbia College Chicago] in Chicago, he had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --all their music.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Everybody was in that big band there, you know that's--
Speaker 1: Al Grey was there, in it too.  So, now he's like, okay, you know now he's in touch with my uncle 'cause now he has somebody who really, really understand what he is trying to and so he comes to Denver [Colorado], and he does the Dip- Dick Gibson party [Colorado Jazz Party] here in Denver first and the concert is a trio concert and an orchestra with the orchestra.  So, this is my first orchestra experience in eleventh grade [at George Washington High School, Denver, Colorado] and singing with and he would have these all-star groups so, it could be Roland Hanna on piano, or it could be Jimmy Rowles, it could be George Duvivier on bass.  It was just all of these star players, Eddie "Lockjaw" Davis (laughter) you know it was like, it was a--and that's how I met, oh my god, Pearl Bailey's husband--
Speaker 2: Oh, I know who you're talking about, Louie Bellson (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Louie Bellson, that's how I met Louie 'cause he played a lot with him, okay, so I'll hold onto that little thing.  So, then okay so now my life is really starting to, you know, there's all of these things going on.
Story_ID: 520482
Speaker 1: I find out in, in my c- class that in my choral class in the, the, that a lot of the kids in the class, in that particular class, the concert choir class, go to Europe in the summer for six weeks.  So, I asked my mother [Vada Burrell Swanson] can I go, they have access you know and I say can I go and it's $1800 for six weeks.  My mother's a nurse, my father [Reeves' stepfather, William A. Swanson] at the time was postal carrier, mail carrier and they said, "When do we have to have the money in?" and I told her and they said "Okay, you can--we'll make sure that you can go."  They put in a deposit, they made sure.  So, between my junior and--year in high school [George Washington High School, Denver, Colorado], and my senior year I'm off by myself, routed through Bangor, Maine into--our first stop was in Great Britain and here we are and I'm in Europe now you know and we are staying in youth hostels, it was very, very safe at the time.  At the time, there were other kids that were with us and there's a guy that is still a very, very good friend of mine.  His name is Charles, and he, he was--Charles Goldstein, and he was gay and I'm black and nobody wants anything to do with either one of us, so we, you know we go to--we're in the same choir, we go together, we've been friends forever, so we take on Europe and we are the--it turns out that a lot of these students got to go over there because their parents just wanted them to leave over the summertime and so, we come together and we are, we explore everything.  We end up down in Wales and Charles, the Prince Charles [Charles, Prince of Wales] is there, but I didn't know anything about royalty and he is like overwhelmed by what I'm doing.  I--we're singing while we're over there.  He's overwhelmed while, while I'm there and what I'm doing you know and you know there were pictures taken which I don't have of us, but I remember later on realizing, oh, that's him.  So, we are traveling all over Europe, we end in, we're in Switzerland and we end in Italy and we come home, so that was the six weeks of my summer between junior high--and I mean junior year and my senior year.
Speaker 2: This is 1972 basically (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 520483
Speaker 1: So, now I'm into my last year of school, of high school [George Washington High School, Denver, Colorado], and there is this opportunity to be a part now of the madrigal group that has switched to the Madrilaires because of the jazz component.  I'm still a part of the jazz band and the concert choir and I s- my band [Mellow Moods] is going strong, and I'm doing more gigs with my uncle [HistoryMaker Charles Burrell].  So now I'm really, you know, working, and making a way for myself.  A lot of musicians are coming through Denver [Colorado] at the same time whenever Clark [Clark Terry] has things that were near, in states that were nearby.  He's inviting me to come and perform with him.  Going back to this Wichita Jazz Festival, I started doing the Wichita Jazz Festival and that's where I met, you know, Count Basie.  I actually met Sarah Vaughn at that time.
Speaker 2: What was that like, I mean?
Speaker 1: It was, actually we were opening for the Basie, we came on before the Basie band [Count Basie Orchestra], I won't say opening.  We were coming on before the Basie band and it was during the time that she was singing with Basie, and I, my little hit thing was the song, 'On a Clear Day.'  I had made my own arrangement and Clark was like always cool to, you know, play the things that I came up with and I remember standing on stage and looking to my left and seeing something very sparkly kind of the light hitting a dress.  And I'm like, oh, she's out there, you know.  And so, I sang every note, and he teased me after, he said you sang every note you knew and that you could reach, and when I got off the stage she came back, and she looked at me she said, "For as long as I live I don't ever want you to open for me again," and then walks off.  And all the musicians are cracking up laughing, and, and I'm almost in tears.  He's like "No, that was a--," (laughter), you know, "She's telling you she really, really loved it," you know, and I, I thought wow, what a funny way to tell that, and so I'm working with him and I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, so, so her personality just because I guess I don't think we've interviewed anybody that knew Sarah Vaughn.  Did you get a chance to know her any better then or--?
Speaker 1: Yes, there's another story (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 520484
Speaker 1: And I just remembered being just like totally just blown away.  I've just seen Sarah Vaughn, and I'm up here and, you know, all of these other great musicians and singers--as a matter of fact Pat Metheny just started being Pat Metheny.  You know he was just on the scene, saw the Return to Forever, remembered hearing Sir Roland Hanna's like, "As far as return, return, they can return to forever as far as I'm concerned," because now it's the fusion music and the traditional jazz music.  So, I saw all of these things and in working with Clark [Clark Terry], Clark was always someone who was about educating young people in this music if they wanted to.  So, through him I met also Dr. Billy Taylor [HistoryMaker Billy Taylor], but I also met someone who is a friend of mine to this day it's like my little sister, she's like my little sister, and that's [HistoryMaker] Terri Lyne Carrington.  Now, he brought her in to play drums with him and you couldn't see her, but you could hear her and I remember being you know, being in a band with Eddie "Lockjaw" Davis, Mundell Lowe and I think, I think George Duvivier was on bass this particular time and Jimmy Rowles, no, maybe--I don't--it was Roland Hanna was on piano and she was playing and they were all wondering about her and Clark always was this like, this great lighthouse.  You know through the storm you, you know no matter what it was that you were feeling, as long as he's on stage with you, you knew that you were all right and he was there to promote you and he would, he was very hard you know.  Like he would tell me like, "Stick to the melody."  You know I'd be singing something and I'd try to do something, he'd tell me to stick to the melody because maybe I wasn't singing inside the chord or the harmonies in the right way and then when I would so something right, he was the one to go, "Unh-uh-uh," so you knew, and he was, and this experience was, when I realized that the music was not just about something, it was an experience. It wasn't something heard, it was something felt and it was also something that was communicated and, for a minute you know when I would start work-, when I was working with him in the very beginning, I felt very much outside the band and then because I knew that there was this communication going on that I wasn't a part of and I wanted to be a part of it.  I thought, that's the thing, is to be able to communicate and he would always just say, "Just listen, just listen, be inspired by what you're hearing," and so, when I would listen to them certain times they would play a solo and they would come off a solo and play you a certain line and if the line hit me, then I would lead into my verse, maybe having, maybe singing this certain line.  So now I'm beginning to understand that this is a very, very intimate art and there's an intimate exchange going on and there's a conversation going on and sometimes it's very serious and sometimes it's funny, you know the people, you know you're, and sometimes it's about quoting somebody who came before.  So, now I'm learning this language and once again, being a part of a living school.  Everybody plays a different way, now I'm realizing it could be four trumpet players, but everybody could play you know and they're all gonna sound different, like listening to, you know, Ella [Ella Fitzgerald], Sarah [Sarah Vaughan], Carmen [Carmen McRae], all sing the son-, same song and now realizing there's a distinct way that everybody approaches the music.  So, now how do you define yourself, how do you refine what it is that you are and what you wanna say how do you, what inspires you, where's your uniqueness because they're all unique.
Story_ID: 520485
Speaker 1: At this time now my sister [Sharon Hill-Washington] is working with the Civil Rights Commission [United States Commission on Civil Rights], and she invites me to come and have like a job after school that's a couple of hours, mostly just filing but more than anything being in that environment.  So, now I'm at the Civil Rights Commission doing whatever with her, whatever she needs me to do and it was exciting, and I'm singing in all of these situations, now I'm traveling 'cause I'm going off and I'm doing things with Clark Terry and the, the--we were on split sessions in my ju-, in my senior year in high school [George Washington High School, Denver, Colorado], so I went in the morning and I was finished with school by a lot of times one o'clock 'cause I'd taken all the classes, so I had maybe three, maybe three or four classes that I had to take, and some just three on a day.  Some of 'em were every day.  So, this is my last year and I'm really you know into my own musical tastes now.  My uncle's [HistoryMaker Charles Burrell] brought me the tradition now, you know they're the Brecker Brothers are out, The Headhunters are out.  I can go to concerts and you know hear all of this music that I'm digging and at that time you know you heard that, you know one of my favorite artists was Marvin Gaye and he's mixing jazz and soul music together.  You have Miles Davis, the 'Bitches Brew' is out and I'm--now I'm listening to 'Native Dancer' and, you know, Dizzy [Dizzy Gillespie] is, has you know, is working with musicians in Cuba and now this world music thing is starting to happen Mahavishnu [Mahavishnu Orchestra], Return to Forever is you know is going on with Chick Corea and his music is exciting and moving and, and really unique and different and Earth, Wind and Fire's come on the scene and we're listening to all this very, very rich music, and I remember my dad [Reeves' stepfather, William A. Swanson] turned me on to 'Bitches Brew' and I remember I would come home and the two hours that I would be sometimes at home by myself before they came home from work and I'd have it on and I'd just be you know dancing and moving and this--you know I didn't understand it, but it felt v-, you know I felt something really, really deep and I'm, I'm loving this music.
Story_ID: 520486
Speaker 1: Denver [Colorado] is, has opened up and there are a lot of clubs that you can go and sit in and sing, jam sessions are happening, this is really good jazz culture going on.  A lot of the singers that are here in Denver--local singers are very loving and generous and I go down and listen to them, they invite me to their stages so you know that whole narrative that comes later on about you know singers being catty, that wasn't something, you know, that I came up in.  It didn't exist and now, I'm working and oh, and my si- I'm going to concerts with my sister [Sharon Hill-Washington] and we mention Mongo Santamaria, and there was this club that opened up during my, at the end of my junior year called The Warehouse [Denver, Colorado], and it had upstairs were all the big acts, and downstairs was a place called the Tool Shed, which was this like very, very hip club and they served food and drinks and the stage is located in the center of the room and people came and they were you know cool and dressed really cool and very sophisticated, had a really, kind of had those Hugh Hefner, Playboy Club type vibes in terms of the way people would sit around and listen comfortably you know the in-crowd to the music, and there was this pianist that came to town, his name is Gene Harris, so Gene Harris comes to town and I--he had to have a jam session on Sunday nights, and I go down and I'm going to the jam session and you know every night just you know having, every Sunday night showing up, and the owner of the club liked me and Gene said, "You know this girl has something."  Now I'm finding out him as being you know the first pianist of [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson and you know he's like this big recording artist and is just coming through Denver, loved it and decided to hang in Colorado for a while, and he travels all over the world and he--they invited me to, to be on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights and I'm in high school [George Washington High School, Denver, Colorado], so the only thing was I had to have you know a chaperon.  So, it would either be my mother [Vada Burrell Swanson], my father [Reeves' stepfather, William A. Swanson] or my sister now who's ten years older and this is her kind of thing, so it worked out really wonderfully and they paid me $200 a night which was pretty amazing.  So, I have $200 a night that I'm, I'm making $600 a weekend and I'm you know, that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now this is--put this in perspective.  This is 1972?
Speaker 1: Four [1974].
Speaker 2: Seventy--
Speaker 1: About '73 [1973], '74 [1974], yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, so that's really two hundre-, I mean that's really $600--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --I mean compared to now.
Speaker 1: Yes, it's very serious (background noise).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 520487
Speaker 1: So at that time you know there was like this really incredible music that was happening now because of [HistoryMaker] Wayne Shorter I wanna hear this music that's from Brazil and I'm in love with this singer, Milton Nascimento and the way that this Brazilian music is happening you know, Antonio Carlos Jobim is now in, in place and it's very sophisticated and beautiful and I have this kind of connection that I didn't even know you know, but I felt like I recognized it and there's a singer, Flora Purim and she comes out, and my cousin George [HistoryMaker George Duke] is producing her records and so, there's this other kind of connection and she's singing in Portuguese and this music sounds so beautiful and the language is incredible.  I decided to learn 'Insensatez' ['Insensatez (How Insensitive)'] which is--means how insensitive, but I learn it from her.  So, I learn it off the record having no idea if the words are right, but it's so beautiful I take to Gene Harris, he says, "Absolutely."  So, now I have this experience of being in and, you know, everybody's like, "Oh, my god, she's sing this other language," you know and you know this is incredible and he's turning me on to songs and I'm--and we're having a good time together and he's like but the most amazing accompanist and at that time you know I didn't even really know what that meant.  There was one woman, oh, I'm gonna come back to her--Louise Duncan, who lived here in Denver, Colorado who was an incredible pianist and she was the local pianist that I would go with my uncle [HistoryMaker Charles Burrell] and sit in, but now we're doing more music that you know is out now, kind of the jazz music that is out now.  The harp synth- synthesizer had just come into being--'Mother Nature's Son,' [HistoryMaker] Ramsey Lewis has just recorded this, it's like changing everything and now you're able to take jazz music, songs that you listen to and create a new set of standards, you know, and give these--this new music that you're listening to from R&B artists or whoever, The Beatles or whoever and give it a jazz sensibility.
Story_ID: 520488
Speaker 1: So, like I said in this club [The Warehouse, Denver, Colorado] I worked at--downstairs [in the Tool Shed], I had a chaperone.  When people would offer to buy me drinks 'cause I always looked older than I was, I would always get the drinks that my sister [Sharon Hill-Washington] and her friends liked and they would send over to the table.  So, that was a major thing, then the other thing was at that time also 'Lady Sings the Blues,' 'Mahogany' these movies are out and Diana Ross is giving us fashion and you know like another--we're seeing this kind of color on the, on these films that we've never seen before and these clothes and this way and this attitude and energy and, and I'm making my clothes.  So, now you know I'm, I'm going to see her movies like eight times and sketching 'em in my mind, sketching certain things that she has and in--you know going to get Simplicity and Butterick patterns and changing 'em up and trying to make these outfits that she's wearing.  So, now I'm flam- like I got this vibe and I come in with hats and capes and you know, (laughter) you know I'm expressing myself and so, no one ever knew what they were gonna see and, and then I went, I had the opportunity not only to sing downstairs but to go upstairs, hear the big acts, and then a lot of the jazz acts when they were upstairs would come down 'cause they knew Gene Harris.  So, now there's this other kind of exposure.  This one particular time, Ella Fitzgerald was performing there, and I got a chance to go upstairs to see her and she was singing the music of The Beatles which just blew me away because she's swinging their music, and you know at that time everybody's singing 'Yesterday' and you know 'Eleanor Rigby' you know all of those songs and the songs of Simon and Garfunkel.  So, you know she's singing The Beatles' songs and I meet her and she's very lovely to me and her, her--now, I'm seeing what happens when a singer you know of this magnitude is here and her wardrobe chests were there and her clothes, shoes everything she's there, you know are there.  Her assistant and you know she's--picks what she's gonna sing, what she's gonna walk in, walk on stage with.  It was pretty extraordinary and she was very sweet to me and wanted to come down and sit in, only the altitude got to her.  So, basically her show had to be canceled for a couple of days and she was supposed to be there for a week, and so they got my uncle [HistoryMaker Charles Burrell], Louise Duncan and asked me to go on and sing some songs in her stead.  So, you know now I'm like really you know blown away.  So, I go up and sit in her dressing room and she had a pair of periwinkle blue kitten pump, thick kitten pump heels with a round toe and she had very narrow feet and I put my feet in her shoes and I wore her shoes on stage and I sang three or four songs and the band took the rest and then she came back and heard that I had sung and you know was just very, very sweet, and then [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson came.  She came downstairs and sang.  At the time Les McCann you know was like hot and he was there, Mongo Santamaria which prior to my working at this place, my sister had taken me to see him, and he'd come back again, but taken me to see him and Ike [Ike Turner] and Tina Turner.  So, now he comes back and now I'm familiar with his music.  So, this is a really rich time.
Story_ID: 520489
Speaker 1: I end up getting--graduating high school [George Washington High School, Denver, Colorado].  I'm working, I get a full scholarship to University of Colorado [University of Colorado Denver, Denver, Colorado], I wanna be a vocal jazz major, but I end up--because they don't really have that, they just started this jazz program there.  So, I end up taking composition and, and it was nice but I wasn't happy 'cause I wasn't really able to expand in my singing, but I was getting great musical knowledge and it was during this time--now, I'm still working, still making and saving money.  I buy myself, at that time Nissans were called Datsuns.  I bought a Datsun Honey Bee for $2999, and I had the money to buy it.  I had saved my money, I didn't know you know what was happening, at the time the, the dean of the jazz--music school was William Fowler, Dr. William Fowler, and his sons now are on all my cousin's records.  I mean they're playing you know, they're playing trumpet and I think trombone, or whatever and bass. They're like out there, the Fowler Brothers--you're hearing 'em, you're seeing 'em on the back of these records and once--and the other thing I just wanna say, that's the thing--reading the back of the records was how you found the people you needed to get to, which was what I loved.  So, now I'm there, and Earth, Wind and Fire is really, really big at this time and Philip Bailey has decided, Philip Bailey of Earth, Wind and Fire coming from Denver, Colorado was, and Larry Dunn, they're all looking for talent out of Denver, Colorado, mostly, they're friends that they worked with before, they became Earth, Wind and Fire, and--
Speaker 2: So they're older than you?  And they've been out for a while, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They're older than me, they're older than me so they never heard me sing, so, but their friends who were here they heard me sing, so it's Julius Carey, Winston Ford [C. Winston Ford, Jr.] and, and oh my god I gotta say this--I just said his name, Carl, Carl Carwell--Carl Carwell, and Carl was the one that asked me to be a--he saw me with the Mellow Moods and all this and he was the one that asked me you know would I wanna move to Los Angeles [California].  I said, "Well, I'm in school, and you know, but let me think about it."  So, h- I said I thought it would be a good idea it would be an opportunity to do something new.  My cousin George [HistoryMaker George Duke] is out there so this is really, really great and so I let him know I'm coming out there.  I wanna come out there and Carl goes, Carl Carwell goes and he talks to my mother [Vada Burrell Swanson] and he asks her, you know and tells her what the situation is and that they're gonna look out for me and, and I remember my mother asking me, "Is this what you want do?" because my parents were so supportive in my dream of singing, and I said, "Yes" and she said, "You, you still have to, you know, go to school, you're gonna have to figure that out."  And I said, "Okay, no problem." So here I was you know getting ready to get in my new Datsun Honey Bee with the, with--and three different, there were three different cars that were going, two Volkswagens and my Honey Bee, and we were all going to caravan from Denver to Los Angeles and for each car my mother gave fried chicken and pound cake.  So, I always laugh and say we left chicken bones all the way from Denver to, to Los Angeles.  We get to Los Angeles and their manager, his name is Jones [ph.]--let me come back.
Speaker 2: This is like fall of '74 [1974]?
Speaker 1: No, now this is '77 [1977].
Speaker 2: Seventy-seven [1977], okay, '77 [1977] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is '77 [1977] when I end up leaving.
Story_ID: 520490
Speaker 1: After high school [George Washington High School, Denver, Colorado], after the year of college [University of Colorado Denver, Denver, Colorado] and after, you know, so this is '77 [1977], you know I'm, I--I'm still there and or a year and a half of college and then I just leave in '77 [1977], and I stay in this house with their manager for about six months I'm living there until I reali- I wanna start working and George [HistoryMaker George Duke] has me doing stuff with him on records and background stuff and, and then I end up in a situation--we're rehearsing with this band that Philip [Philip Bailey] put together and it's really wonderful, but I realized I wanna kind of be out on my own.  So, after maybe a year of trying to be with Fr- Free Life, I, I leave and I start singing on my own and Larry Dunn comes into my life very, very strong at this point because he's producing a lot of different artists, like Stanley Turrentine and this group called Caldera, which was made up of all these Latin musicians and so every time he does a project, he would ask me to be a part of it.  So, I started studio work and singing on different people's albums, and you know singing lead and doing different things and I end up meeting all of these musicians.  They were part of this group Caldera and my only exposure to this music is the music that I've heard on these records that kind of you know had some of this music on it but never in its, you know, they were from, it was pure and it was set to jazz. So, it was all this traditional music from Peru, from Brazil, from Colombia, from all over South America, the musicians were f- from everywhere and they gave this music, this beautiful jazz sensibility, George Del Barrio orchestrated the album and his brother, Eduardo Del Barrio, who ended up being--we ended up working together.  They were from Argentina and they--he's playing keyboards and writing a lot of the arrangements and songs his brother's orchestrating and they originally wanted Flora Purim to do it and she wasn't available, and Larry Dunn said, "Get [HistoryMaker] Dianne Reeves, she can--I'll get Dianne Reeves, she can sing anything."  They're like, "Dianne who?" You know, nobody had heard of me at that time.  He's like, "Yeah, you know, I'm just, just---she'll just learn it," and he gave me the song and he said, "Learn it."  So, I learned this song, and it just goes from there.
Story_ID: 520491
Speaker 1: So I, I'm working with him [Eduardo Del Barrio], and then--now we're, now I'm getting other gigs with Louie Bellson 'cause he's in Los Angeles [California] and, and the connection with Clark [Clark Terry], you know now he finds out I'm in, in Los Angeles, so now I'm starting to do gigs with him and members of The Tonight Show Band and we're doing 'em around the city.  So, that was one thing that I had going on (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is Snooky Young--
Speaker 1: Yes, Snooky Young.  Actually, there's a recording of me singing 'On a Clear Day' with Snooky, and he's looking at me because I'm just going on and on and on, but it's hilarious.  Anyway, so now I'm, I'm doing all of that you know, any--my whole thing was I want to do anything that has something to do with music even if I have to teach voice, whatever.  I want to sustain my life with my voice and performing.  So, I'm doing all the studio work, I'm doing gigs and through the Caldera record ['Sky Islands'] this guy who is like writing--is at USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] at this time and he's writing music and, and it's pretty extraordinary and he hears me and Patrice Rushen at the time was out there, and she hooked me up and ended up getting an apartment with a friend of a friend that she knew was looking for a roommate to share an apartment, and so I move away and I have this--lived in this apartment at 737 South Oxford [Avenue], Apartment 21, and I am working with you know--I'll be trying to you know I wanna learn piano again and, and she says, "I don't have time but you should meet this guy named Billy Childs," and I was like, "Okay."  So, Billy Childs had heard me on the Caldera record and was looking for me because had written this song inspired by that and he wanted me to sing it on his record, but he didn't find me in enough time.  It ended up being down on Sunset [Boulevard] at a--I was looking at a vocal mic at a music store and this guy was standing there and he said, "Hi, how you doing?"  I'm like, "Hey, how you doing?"  "You're a musician?"  "Yeah, you're--."  And we're just talking.  He said, "What's your name?"  I said, "[HistoryMaker] Dianne Reeves," he looks at me, he said, "I've been looking for you."  I said, "What's your name?"  He said, "Billy Childs."  I said, "Patrice told me all about you."  So, now (claps) we come together and that relationship has--started in about 19- that same year, 1977, and has continued on and we worked on lots of amazing stuff together.
Story_ID: 520492
Speaker 1: And so you know I'm living in Los Angeles [California].  I'm working, we put toge- Billy [Billy Childs] and I end up putting a group together called Night Flight, and we, we're working at club out in Venice Beach [Los Angeles, California] called the Comeback Inn. And the whole thing about the Comeback Inn was, you know, they didn't really, they didn't pay you; you passed a hat.  But a lot of musicians liked to play the club because you could do the music that you wanted to do and you built your own audience, which is really cool.  It was like a little kind of hippie kind of place, but it was, it was, it was perfect and we would go out there and we would work and at the time one of the first bass players was Larry Klein, who has since become a major producer, and myself, Billy Childs, another friend of mine.  When Billy wasn't there it would be John Beasley and you know we just--it was an extraordinary group of musicians.  Joe Heredia, who was a local drummer in Los Angeles, extraordinary drummer was there and at that time Billy and Larry Klein were working with Stanley Hubbard, I mean--
Speaker 2: Freddie Hubbard (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Freddie Hubbard (laughter) and they were working with Freddie Hubbard, and so they would go and they would things and then come back with stuff they'd write.  The whole thing about our group was--write--our whole thing was to write something, arrange something that was already there that was different and improvisation was and experimentation was like key, you had to take the music as far as you could go.
Story_ID: 520493
Speaker 1: My friend who would play--John Beasley who would play when Billy [Billy Childs] wasn't there worked with Sergio Mendes, and he came and told me--I'm fast forwarding, he came and told me in 1981 that Sergio Mendes was--let me back up just a little bit.  So, this is seventy--in the early '70s [1970s], so about now I'm really, really--want to learn about you know how to really, really sing.  You know I have this voice that I can do all these incredible things with.  We're playing now, we have all this sophistication and rhythm sophistication and we're doing all these things and we're, and I'm using my voice like an instrument but I'm not really singing songs, and I meet this man, Ph- Phil Moore, and Phil Moore has a workshop and the workshop is Get Your Act Together, and it turns out Phil Moore used to make, write acts for you know people like Marilyn Monroe, and Dorothy Dandridge and Lena Horne and you know all their shows, he'd set their shows up.  He worked as a ghostwriter for all the--what it is the like for as, for like a, like a lot of the big like movie themes and orchestration, he would do that and was a good friend of [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones and Quincy learned a lot about writing for these kinds of things, from, from Phil.  He worked with the BBC [BBC Concert Orchestra], he had the film 'More For' [ph.], he was a manager of Bobby Short at one time and later on ended up managing me and he was my mentor, he was like my father.  He looked over me, after me, just I learned a lot of things from Phil Moore.  Artists would come and drop in all the time.  I remember Nina Simone would come and hang out and come and hang out with him and he would call me to come and be there so that I could--he said, "You're just you know a fly on the wall, but listen."  I remember one time Dorothy Donegan, who I fell in love with came and hung out.  He would tell me all of these great musicians' stories, and how she was like this brilliant, brilliant musician who almost had to act like a clown for people to hear her brilliance and you know sh- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She played the piano and sung at the same time--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes--well, just played piano.
Speaker 2: Played piano, okay.
Speaker 1: And she, she would--you know I would sit, and I would sit with her and she played things and so I met her and, you know, of course Clark [Clark Terry] knew him and all these musicians would just come (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This raises a question about women musicians in the jazz world.  Hazel Scott was a brilliant piano player--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --played two pianos at the same time.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: But people say she really never got the recognition she would have got if she had been a male.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And Dorothy Donegan did you say (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Same thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, is it--so is--that's your--
Speaker 1: Melba Liston.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah.
Story_ID: 520494
Speaker 1: And in, when I was in Los Angeles [California], you know, I met you know a lot of you know really, really great musicians and people who were looked over and understanding this way that jazz was.  I mean it was interesting they let you sing, and a lot of people sang just to be in front of the band--and I'm glad you brought that up, because I remember when I had this group Night Flight with Billy [Billy Childs], it was all our group, but whoever booked the gigs, whoever did whatever, you know f- had a certain thing you know we would say that person was the leader, but we were all the leader of the band and I remember this big deejay, jazz deejay in Los Angeles, we had this gig at USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] and, music you know--I was so proud of the music we were doing it was very progressive, and so I'm singing and he inter- he decides to interview Chuck, his name was Chuck Niles, and he interviews Billy Childs and Billy you know he's talking about the band and he said, "Well, like--well who's the chick singer?" And Billy says, "[HistoryMaker] Dianne Reeves," so they're talking and so forth.  He says, "Well who's the leader of the band?"  And Billy looks at him and says, "The chick singer," so (laughter) you know (laughter) those kind of things existed a lot.  You know I, I used to tell people, I would go--because I knew that I would go into some session or if I had a group of musicians I never worked with, I'd go in and I'd take my hardest music and just you know, and just--that was the way that I was able to make you know level, you know, field.  I would take my hardest music and set it front of them and then say, "Okay, let's go" and they would be like "Oh, okay."  So, that was how I s- but as a singer I could do that.  I looked, I watched my very good friend, my little sister, [HistoryMaker] Terri Lyne Carrington, have to navigate all of that and you know she--I mean just you know is a foot planted firmly in the history and understanding of, of jazz music, one foot there, and one in the music of today, as a professor at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California], is great, and she produced my last record ['Beautiful Life'] as a great writer and arranger and you know just really brilliant, but I remember she would play, and even other drummers would look at her and say, "Wow, you're so good you should've been a dude," you know, that kind of stuff and having to navigate all of that, so I think in these days and times a lot of that has changed and she's been one of those people that has really affected a change in that by her two Grammy Award-winning 'Mosaic' ['The Mosaic Project'] albums, but one--the 'Mosaic' album and the album that was dedicated to Ellington [Duke Ellington], it was--both of those won, and one was singers and musicians, the other one was you know was, it was pr-, it was called 'Money Jungle' it was the album that he did 'Money Jungle,' and so she did that and you know was able to win all kinds of things, but anyway still deals with that as a drummer because it's, you know she's not supposed to do that but she does it and she does it extremely well.  So, you know to level the playing field for me that was, you know I just have to always come out as strong as possible, you know to, to, to have people hear me and play for me the way that I needed them to.
Story_ID: 520495
Speaker 1: Tell us about Sergio Mendes now.
Speaker 2: So I'm working with this group, Night Flight, and my friend who also plays--the keyboardist, John Beasley.  He tells me that Sergio Mendes is looking for a singer to be a part of Brasil, at that time, '88 [Sergio Mendes and Brasil '88]. This is 1981, and so I'm excited, it's great, this is an opportunity.  I run out to where he lives and I you know did this audition, and for the audition I did the song that I learned on the record ['Brasil '88'] "Insensatez" ["Insensatez (How Insensitive)"] in Portuguese or what I thought was Portuguese.
Speaker 1: This is the "How Insensitive"--
Speaker 2: Yes, the "How Insensitive" song, and I sang "Wave," too, and "Wave" had some little tricky things in the melody and he wanted to see if I knew what they were, and I sang it correctly.  So, then I sang "Insensatez (How Insensitive)" in Portuguese and I remember Sergio kind of bending over the piano playing and his shoulders were just going up and down, you know, and he's playing and then I finish and he looks at me and he says, "I don't know what it was that you just sang," he said, "but you got the gig."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, after that his wife [Gracinha Leporace]--and when I think about this it was pretty amazing.  The gig was to start two weeks from that, from when I met him.  So his wife gave me a tape and she'd written out the words phonetically to a bunch of songs in Portuguese, "Waters of March" ["The Waters of March"] was one of them and you know the lyric to that song is extremely long.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you sing any of it for us?
Speaker 2: Well, the one that I remember we did of course (singing in Portuguese) something like that, so then I used to do that one.
Speaker 1: I'm convinced.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Story_ID: 520496
Speaker 1: I learned all of these songs in English and Portuguese, committed to memory, in two weeks, and, and I started, we started on this next journey.  And it was interesting working with Sergio [Sergio Mendes].  The thing that I loved about him was he had access to all the great Brazilian composers, and filmmakers and poets, and he knew every--all these people and his whole thing was he--the experience of working with Brasil '88 [Sergio Mendes and Brasil '88] at that time was one thing, but his thing was that he wanted you to know more about the music and the art that comes from his country.  So, anytime someone--I remember there was a movie that came out around--in '81 [1981] called 'Pixote,' and it was about a kid who lived on the street, and they followed--it was a real child and they followed his life, the, the--of course, the movie was in Portuguese and they had it with English subtitles, and he had the art- the, the filmmaker [Hector Babenco] who did the film was at his home and he invited us all to be able to be there and talk to him, as well as, you know, I met Ivan Lins, who you know was this incredible songwriter, and I met Milton Nascimento and Dori Caymmi, later on his sister, Nana Caymmi and it was just all of these amazing musicians you know that would come through his house that he wanted you to know, wanted you to know and he was always you know giving you albums of the things that they did, and so it was very impactful for me.  I loved the music, I loved the way it moved.  There was something that was very familiar about it that I felt like I had been singing it in some kind of way all my life and I always say that you know that was just like my heart and my soul trying to find Africa in all the things that you know I was doing at that time.
Speaker 2: Was Sivuca still around then (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  'Cause he toured with [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte, and--way back--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, well that's next (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: So, I worked with Sergio for a year, and we went to Indonesia, we were in--we went to Israel, went to South America.  We were all over the place in that period of time.  An interesting thing was that everywhere we would go, he would take one of the songs and have it translated into the language of the people who lived there.  So, there was just something that you know they felt you know was theirs, and so I worked with him for a good, a little over a year, and in 1982 was when I was signed to Palo Alto Records.  So, I'm working with Sergio now and this music has made a tremendous influence in my life, and now I'm bringing back ideas that are, that have this Brazilian feeling to my music, and my first record that I do, I produced with Billy Childs, it was called 'Welcome to My Love,' and it is the music that I was doing with Billy, the music that I liked always like that, but this Brazilian component, and I wrote a lot of songs on the record and there was a very--the song that was the one that kind of made it off the record that people really liked was a treatment that we did of "My Funny Valentine" with this kind of groove, and it ended up showing up everywhere which was kind of cool.
Story_ID: 520497
Speaker 1: I did this record ['Welcome to My Love'], and that was like the beginning of a lot of things because it was from this record--now, working still with--and I have my mentor, Phil Moore and Phil is being sounded by a friend of his about the fact that this time [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte is looking for a new voice to be a part of his, his concerts, you know, s- touring and he had, you know he had already had you know people like Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee.  You know he had, of course, Miriam Makeba and all these amazing people, but they were from Africa, and Jer- Greece and he had never really focused on having a young African American singer and that's what he wanted and so, I went and auditioned for him and he really liked it and he said, "I really want you to come and work with me."  So, the, the interesting thing that happened with working with Sergio [Sergio Mendes]--I mean with Harry was when I was working with Sergio, I was still able to use my voice like an instrument because while I understood the gist of what I was singing, it was more about the rhythm and the sound of the, the language that was more like improvisation still.  So, I really wasn't singing songs that were hitting my soul and this--that had not started to come out of me yet, but when I worked with Harry Belafonte, he would s- help, he would start out by selecting--he had a--some songs that he thought would be good for the show that he thought that I could do, and it'd be songs that were, you know, by artists from the Caribbean, or from South Africa or a Native American, or you know just all of these things and the band that he had was this like you know United Nations [UN] of a band because you know they were from everywhere and contributing you know their cultural experience to the band.  So, I, I found some songs that I liked, it was a Joan Armatrading piece and you know several songs and, and it wasn't a place to do any quote unquote jazz music or fusion music that we were doing, and I started feeling really, really strange about the music because the harmonies were very, very simple and it to me sounded like the rhythms were--it just didn't seem like it was going to be a challenge until I started really getting into these songs, and, and then of course being around Harry and hearing him talk, and what they were about, and the civil rights, you know, movement [Civil Rights Movement] and the--and these songs that were singing during apartheid that were you know about the Zambezi river and you know all of these different things and what they, and that they had a dual meaning and, and how powerful they were, and--so now I'm with him and he says, "I don't want anybody to do specific arrangements on the music."  He said, "I want you to get together with the musicians, and I want you guys to workshop the arrangements," which was even more interesting.  So, we had this situation where all--everybody was coming together, they had ideas.  They would put the ideas together and this music was pretty amazing, and I, I loved the experience.  This was the first time I really felt a different kind of artistic freedom in the music because now these are, these songs are constructed in a way that they have not only a, a kind of movement, but they are to convey certain ideas, and we're writing them, and, and arranging them in that way and everybody's heart and soul is in 'em, and some of the rhythms are, you know, are from these different countries and, and the emphasis is in different places and there's a way to hear and sing it and you know it was really exciting and so we get all the music together and we start touring and Harry said, "The most important thing is that when you finish they're standing, and if they're not standing then we have to go back to the workshop," so he was very generous in that arena and I worked with him for three years and it was pretty extraordinary and during that time I also kept a place in New York [New York].  Now, it's now I'm in New York for the very first time.
Story_ID: 520498
Speaker 1: My mother [Vada Burrell Swanson], when she realized that I was moving from Los Angeles [California] to New York [New York] was pretty concerned 'cause she grew up in Detroit [Michigan] and she knew th- you know all the gangs of the street, and she was very streetwise and stuff, and she didn't think that I was.  So, she was constantly trying to tell me, you know, how to be when I go to New York.  "When you go to New York you have to have a certain kind of attitude.  You have to walk with authority."  And I'm just looking at her going, "Okay," you know.  Not, you know she doesn't think I'm paying attention and then she would come back with something else.  "So, when you're out in New York" you know and she's just not feeling like I'm getting it.  So, one day she comes to me and she said, "When you walk down those streets of New York, you think, motherfucker, motherfucker, motherfucker," (laughter).  I laughed so hard and I got it, and when I got there it was amazing because now--living in Los Angeles and living in Denver [Colorado] the--there was a different kind of black experience.  When I got to New York, there was you know it's, it's rich with culture and there's places to go at every hour of the day and night to hear somebody express themselves in this, in a very unique way and I remember having--I just fell in love with it and I remember the first time I went to see DanceAfrica, and the audience you know, everybody was dressed in prints from Ghana and Nigeria and I had never seen you know groomed locks.  I'd seen dreadlocks, 'cause I knew of Bob Marley, but I'd never seen you know these what they called--well, they called them--they were groomed you know.  They didn't call 'em dreadlocks, they called 'em locks and braiders and different kinds of ways to wear your hair braided and different--I mean it was just--the smells, the way of living, the philosophies of living and the, you know just being in Brooklyn [New York] and seeing you know in the summertime the color of Brooklyn with people sitting on stoops and you know West Indian parades and all the different food and, and going to an event and you know I remember one time I went to this event, I walked in the bathroom.  Everybody looked like me but nobody, no woman in the bathroom spoke English, and I thought, my god, you know or standing on the street corner and hearing like four or five different languages.  All of this was just, you know it was, it fed my spirit, my mind, my heart.  I wanted to be involved, I never slept; I was always out doing everything.  You know, listening to people and now you have places like Sweet Basil's [Sweet Basil, New York, New York] and the Vanguard [Village Vanguard, New York, New York] and the Village Gate [New York, New York] at the time and you go Uptown and there are clubs Uptown and you know you didn't have to--you could go and see [HistoryMaker] McCoy Tyner in a club just hanging out playing and it would be McCoy and you know just any number of musicians, Phyllis Hyman might be sitting up there singing with them.  Going down, I remember I met Paquito D'Rivera and you know all of these different musicians, this, this young pianist player--piano player that passed away, Jorge Dalto, who you know, he had heard my music and really liked it and I would go to the Van- the Village Gate and I think it was Wednesday night, which would be Latin night, so you're hearing you know like all of these master musicians down there just having a ball.
Story_ID: 520499
Speaker 1: So, it was, it was just endless and I remember during the time that I was working with Serg- I mean with [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte and living in New York [New York], Jorge Dalto, he really liked my music and at the time he was working with Tito Puente.  So he turned Tito on to my music and I started doing gigs with Tito Puente.  We did the Monterey Jazz Festival, we did the Playboy Jazz Festival, did a lot--a series of a lot of gigs.  So, this was another thing that was happening.  I wasn't so much in the studio now.  Now, I was working and you know I was working with all kinds of different musicians, being able to go you know, I mean Los Angeles [California] had clubs where you could go and see people up close and personal, but not only could you see them up close and personal, you could go hang with 'em at Bradley's [New York, New York], you know.  That's where musicians hang and you know so it was just, it was rich and you could take African dance classes and, and it was you know you learned the difference in you know--you take something, you know dance classes from Senegal, Ghana, you know Nigeria, you know all these different drums and it was just you know amazing.  For me it was, it, it was almost like coming full circle, all the things that I had been listening to, and the, the Latin music I had sung while I was in Los Angeles, and you know, you know finally I'm coming full circle and now here is all this incredible music and these amazing jazz musicians, and musicians who are my age, who are out there doing stuff.  So, I met while I was living in New York I would see Cassandra all the time and Abbey Lincoln in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Cassandra Wilson?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm sorry, Cassandra Wilson, Abbey Lincoln and see the posters for Aminata Moseka and go see her and you know there were, there were all of these amazing treasures that lived in New York that some people that you would you know, you know, never, ever hear and you know musicians that you would work with and families of musicians and people that I ended up working with and so, I loved New York for that and it, it really fed my--it fed everything and so I stayed there for about--for the three years I worked with Harry Belafonte and it was just really more of a period--and during that time, I did my second record with Palo Alto [Palo Alto Records] in 1985, 'For Every Heart,' and it was kind of hit and miss but there were some jewels on there and one of 'em was the duet that I said that I--
Speaker 2: You did Jon Lucien and--
Speaker 1: --did with Jon Lucien called "Separate Vacations" and at the time the, the guy that produ- helped produce that record was Richard Cummings, I had met him, and he was very mu- a lot of the band that I had worked with Harry, they kind of shaped that record, so we did things like "Be My Husband," "Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing" and you know all these kind of more folk-oriented things, so from my first record to my second record the sound had totally changed and I remember Billy [Billy Childs] saying, "What are you doing, this is--you know this isn't you," and I'm like, "This is me now," you know, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we're gonna talk about this later 'cause it seems like critics always wanna say that about you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that your music changes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But it's--we'll, we'll--
Speaker 1: And, and I got highly criticized for a lot of the things that I did.
Story_ID: 520500
Speaker 1: In 1985, we, Manhattan Records had just come into being and everybody had always told me about Bruce Lundvall, and I heard about him because even Miles Davis talked about Bruce Lundvall and that this is you know like a good guy and you know all kinds of really wonderful things about him.  So, we tried to--Harry [HistoryMaker Harry Belafonte] did this thing where he was introducing me to New York [New York] in 1985 and we did this show at SOB's [Sounds of Brazil, New York, New York] and--
Speaker 2: Right, that's Sounds of Brazil, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sounds of Brazil, yeah, and he had just open- it hadn't even been opened that long and, and at that time there were a lot of Brazilian acts and stuff that would play there.  Anyway, I didn't realize that my first record ['Welcome to My Love'] had done so well, so every- when people found out you know the, every show was sold out.  I did three nights, two shows a night, and they were all--I mean people wrapped around the, the corner, it was amazing and the thing that I loved about it was this was probably for me, you know these were my peers that were out in the audience and probably one of the most sophisticated kind of listening audiences that I'd ever been in front of.  I mean reacting and feeling and this was my generation and they're feeling me and it, it was pretty extraordinary, and mu- a lot of musicians would come down and hang and so it was, it was different and I was starting to define my voice and my sound and, and my abilities.
Story_ID: 520501
Speaker 1: So I lived in New York [New York] 'til '86 [1986], and then I ended up moving back full-time to Los Angeles [California] in '86 [1986], still trying to be in touch with Blue Note [Blue Note Records], still wanting to get--now Blue Note has been established and I wanna be a part of the label, so I'm working with George [HistoryMaker George Duke] and doing different things and he's kind of--George is like my fairy godfather, he--things would just end up sh- like I'd need something and he'd find out and it would just show up and it would be like years later before I'd realize that he was the one that making different things happen, and--
Speaker 2: Is George--?
Speaker 1: George Duke, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: George Duke, okay, all right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And the interesting thing I always wanted, he would always say you know from the very first record I did with Palo Alto [Palo Alto Records], "I wanna produce your records," and, and I knew how powerful and how, you know, rich his talents and abilities, musicianship, he's an impeccable musician, and--but I knew that I needed to find myself before I, I started working with him.
Speaker 2: Now one thing in found out when we interviewed him is that, and I didn't know that's it's not on the albums is that he was producing Anita Baker's music.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he did Anita Baker's music, um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I didn't know, it's not written, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He had all the records on the wall down there, and, stories about her and--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, and they and he was like one of those kind of musicians people would go to and they just trusted him because he, he could listen to you on all levels, musically, emotionally, all of that and just be there for you.  He was that kind of--he was a pillar.
Story_ID: 520502
Speaker 1: So finally, 1987 comes, and I get a meeting with Bruce Lundvall at the Bel Age Hotel [Los Angeles, California], and George [HistoryMaker George Duke] was also a part of making that happen, so now he's hearing, he wants to speak to me.  So, I go into him--in--and we were out in this conference room, it was just me and him and I told him I said, "You need me on your label."  I said, "You didn't come and listen to me in 1985," and, and I just started saying you know who I was and what I could do and why I wanna be on his label and I remember he looked at me and he said, "Okay, I'll sign you," and I said, "No you won't until you hear me. You have to hear me," I said, "and I happen to have a concert that's coming up, it's called Echoes of Ellington, and it's gonna be at the Wiltern Theatre [Los Angeles, California], and I would like for you to come, and I have two tickets for you here right now, will you please come to my concert and hear me?"  And so, I gave him the tickets, told him what time, you know, and that I would be there and I really looked forward to him being there.  So, I went back and I told my mentor what I had done--told Phil Moore what I had done and Bru- as well as George and they were like, "Oh, okay" and it was just two days later so I, we had done the rehearsals for it and now it's time to do the show and there's all of these different artists that are on this particular show, jazz artists, and, and I sing 'I Got It Bad (That Ain't Good)' ['I Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good)'] and I don't know what else it was that I sang, but--oh, 'Do Nothing Until You Hear From Me,' and so I'm asking my mentor, "Is he out there yet? Do you see him, is he out there?"  He's like, "No, he's not there."  So, my time is coming to be on the stage and it was just like one of those stars aligned type moments as I'm walking on stage I see him coming down the center aisle to take his seat, so I slowed up so that he could sit down, you know thank the--thank ladies and gentlemen, we weren't even supposed to talk, but I just wanted him to get comfortable and then once he sat down, counted off the song and I sang and afterwards he said, "Let's, let's start on your record right away."  And what he would do is he would fly out to Los Angeles [California] and I would--I had, I used to do this gig at this place called At My Place [Santa Monica, California].  A lot of musicians played there and he would come down and see me.  He had never heard "Better Days," I had recorded it on my first album ['Welcome to My Love'] for Palo Alto [Palo Alto Records], and he said, "You gotta do that song."  I said, "I've already recorded--recorded it."  He said, "Do it again."  I said, "Really?"  He said, "Yeah."  I was like, "Okay" you know.  So, my first record was 'Dianne Reeves' on Blue Note [Blue Note Records], and the record is very representative, I wanted to represent--because I didn't think people really knew me so I did songs I had done in the past and I wanted them to know what my journey was so, it was pretty amazing because on that record [HistoryMaker] Herbie Hancock was on it, Tony Williams was on it Freddie Hubbard was on that record and you know my friend Billy Childs, and Eddie Del Barrio [Eduardo Del Barrio] who I'd been working with, you know we did things together.  He wrote arrangements for me and you know it was, it was my journey to that point and that's, and this was a big label and this is how I wanted to start off you know, my recording life.
Story_ID: 520503
Speaker 1: Okay, 'Better Days' is the song that, I think everybody--
Speaker 2: 'The Grandma Song' (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) has heard, this is the one that--I mean in Chicago [Illinois], this had to be ten years ago, you were at the African Fest [African Festival of the Arts]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --maybe a little longer, I don't know.  You were standing on stage, it was a clear night, the wind was blowing your garment in the wind, and you started singing, "Silver--"
Speaker 2: "Gray hair--"
Speaker 1: I look--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --and around me were Bobby Womack, who is now deceased, "Silver hair" she types out all the works for Haki [HistoryMaker Haki Madhubuti] at Third World Press--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: --all these, Sister Thelma Myers [ph.] of the UNI [ph.], all these people that I knew.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: They were powerful, older women who you know passed down that, that--they were part of the intergenerational transmission, and, I'm just filled with emotion.  I filmed, I mean I videotaped it.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: And if I could find it, I tried to find it before I came down--
Speaker 2: Oh, my god.
Speaker 1: --it's so beautiful--
Speaker 2: I'd love to hear.
Speaker 1: --the song and reactions of the people sitting there, 'cause you know I'm an amateur videographer, but you know it's just beautiful, and so how did you, I mean when I think about a song, I found out there's a painting by Paul Goodnight [HistoryMaker Paul D. Goodnight] where there are three generations of black women, a little girl--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --and they're braiding each other's hair.  I always think about that when I--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: --hear that song, but it's a--I mean it's a powerful, powerful song, I know people have told you that before. And the emotional response to it is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, people have always told, would always tell me their stories, you know.  I mean, 'Better Days' is a whole journey unto itself.  I wrote it like in 1978 with this guy, Tony Lorrich.  His mother had passed, my [maternal] grandmother [Denverado Howard Burrell] had just passed and it was a--actually, it's about both of them.  It was a way to pay tribute to them at that time.  I remember I used to go to the, to the practice studios over at--I don't know how we were getting in there, in UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] in their music rooms and I would go over there and practice, you know playing the piano and I started, I wrote it--I actually wrote the music before the lyrics were written, and then the lyr- then we did the lyrics, and it, that song to this day you know that was what '78 [1978] and this is 2016, people request it, they still wanna hear it.  I remember singing it one time at an event in Los Angeles [California]--I don't really remember what it was, but it was, but there were rappers and all kind of people that were there and this was right after it came out the second time and my friend said  (laughter) they were, they said, "You got on stage and they were, you know you were getting ready to sing 'Better Days,'" and she said, "I'm standing in the back and there were these rappers over to the side they were like, 'Hold up, man, this is about grandma,'" and they just got quiet, and I said, you know, he said, "This is grandma," you know, and I was like wow you know.  So, yeah that, that song has stood the test of time, but the thing I love about it is, and something that I believe in, is storytelling and it was a thing that I grew up with, I grew up with great storytellers, and I would love to he- it loved it when people would come and share their stories about their grandmother, their aunt, their momma, whatever.
Story_ID: 520504
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) WDAS [WDAS Radio, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was playing it [Reeves' song, 'Better Days'], and I was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] because of it--the club that was there called the Chestnut Cabaret [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and found out I had this big audience in Chicago [Illinois] and all up and down the eastern seaboard you know was just you know I'd go and it's like, "Grandma!" you know.  I remember being at the Mann theater and they had, Phyllis Hyman was on the show with--who else was that?  Stop--oh, gosh it'll come to me, anyway and they needed another person to like kind of open the show and so they got in touch with my agent of course and I ended up on that show and that's when I met Phyllis.  And it was really funny because when I met her she was in the room next door to me and somebody had the--I guess they mixed up her water, she liked Perrier, and they put it in my room, and she was just going off about how could they put, you know her water in, in my room and she just, you know was just--I could hear her, so I picked up the water and I, I kicked the door and I said, "They put this in my room, and I know that it was for you 'cause I could hear you."  So, she just kind of looked at me and then when I went and got on stage, I looked to my left and she was standing there and she was waving and I loved her, she, and she was waving.  I did my show and I was coming off and people were like, "Ah" you know, and she hugged me and she said, "Please go back out they wanna hear more, go back out."  And so, I went back out and I sang a little bit more and I came back and from that point on we were always you know, we weren't close friends, but we were always in touch and I remember the day that she, she died, it just, oh, that's--we'll talk about that later, but it destroyed me, it was really, really bad because this industry is very hard on you and it is, it is very judgmental and it, it can change on you and it can you know say you're old, it can say you're a has-been, it can start calling people the new you, you know it does all of these kinds of things and you're, you know you're always out there you know putting your heart on the line and she was one of those kind of singers who sang you know from her soul.  I mean she really meant what she was saying and she was honest about how she would say it and the way that she would sing.
Story_ID: 520505
Speaker 1: You know, I have been through so many things.  I mean in the early part of my career you know having critics just you know, just go in on me.  I remember one time I did this gig in Arizona and the name of the article, we were there for a week and he had come the first night and he called the article "Raking Reeves," and he tore into me in a way that, you know it, it hurt me because first of all, he was, this was going to serve to take away any revenue 'cause then after that a lot of people didn't come and because you know he also took away the experience of people to experience me on their own and see who I was, and things that he was saying were like not ground in anything, they were very hateful things.
Speaker 2: For instance, like--?
Speaker 1: You know, I think the last line of the thing is, "As long as there are people--," but this part made me kind of feel good, she said, he said, "As long as there are people out there trying to sing this music like [HistoryMaker] Dianne Reeves and Bobby McFerrin," and you know he named like all these people that I respect (laughter), you know.  I was like, well, at least I'm in good company, and I realized he didn't know what he was talking about and at that time I used to read all the reviews because you know sometimes, somebody can say something they're really gifted in a way that they, you know you look at it as a like a, a critique that will help you know 'cause sometimes people wil say something to destroy, just destroy your soul.  I--Phil Moore used to tell me, "Stop reading any of 'em, good or bad," 'cause some of the good ones would even piss me off, but because you would just know, god, this person has no idea of what they're talking about.  What are they relate- what are they saying?  But you know some of the biggest critics you know and in the very beginning had not so nice words to say about me and it was because--they would see me in a certain context, like if they were jazz critics and they saw me working in a jazz setting like with Clark Terry you know or Louie Bellson or something like that or this guy named Nick DeMeo [ph.] was a trombone player who worked with The Tonight Show Band, he was always booking me places and I worked with Doc Severinsen too at the time and when it was seen in that context it was one thing.  So, they wouldn't come to the Billy Child's Night Flight shows you know to see the other thing that we were doing and that would be the thing you know, the voice of my right now you know what I was working on, that would be the thing that would end on the record and they liked what they heard in these traditional settings, and then so I started to really--by the time, by 1983 and dealing with all of this, I, I decided I had to have a thick skin, and I had to decide, you know, are you gonna do and say what you wanna say, or are you going to you know be hurt and be--create, create--courageous and say what you wanna say or are you, you know just gonna you know bow down, and you know do what they think you should do?  And, and I decided to do what it was that I wanted to do.
Story_ID: 520506
Speaker 1: And I remember 1987, I did that record--it did--the 'Dianne Reeves' record, and it was really good.  The next record that came was a record called 'Never Too Far' and 'Never Too Far' had a lot of social and political statements on it and--
Speaker 2: What were the topics you were dealing with then?
Speaker 1: Well, at that time I was living in Los Angeles [California] and there was a lot of gang violence.  So, I did a song called "How Long" that was on that record and also, but one of the things--I did another song called "Fumilayo," which came from my experience of being in New York [New York], and you know being in a setting where you know I was you know exposed to African philosophies of life that really made sense to me that I started using in my own life and, and so that, that song was on there "Never Too Far" ended on there because my friend, this--at this point Phil Moore had died, 1988, and that just kind of left me in a, in a, in a different kind of place.  So, I did two songs to him, "Never Too Far" and "Company."  So, the record was emotional and it was you know, it was my--and I did a song called "Keep Your Eyes On The Prize" [sic. "Eyes on the Prize"] because--"And Your Back to The Wind" [sic.], I'll never forget that and that was you know I was a lot of young students and, and seeing you know in their neighborhood settings what they were up against, and that you can make a way out of no way and so that was just my way of saying all of those things.  So, in 19- you know '89 [1989] that record comes out and at that time there was, in the music industry there was a very strong you know black music sections in all the, in all the industry, and this record was crawling up the charts and it needed to cross over.
Story_ID: 520507
Speaker 1: And I'll never forget the guy that was the head of the company at that time--at the same, let me back up a little bit.  I had done that record, but I also did a record for Japan and I did it at Rudy Van Gelder Studio [Van Gelder Studio, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey], and it was a jazz record, and Bobby Hutcherson played on it and you know there were a lot of really, really cool people and it was this straight-ahead jazz record, and--so, I did this record.  It only came out in Japan and I was very proud of it because with Kevin Eubanks played guitar, we did "Like a Lover," and I had met Dori Caymmi from Sergio Mendes [Sergio Mendes and Brasil '88], so I recorded that song and you know it was, there was just--being able to have two sides of me out you know at the same time was pretty extraordinary and the head of the record company, Baskerman [ph.]--and things were like starting to pop off and it was really, really beautiful.  Baskerman then took me in his car and the, the 'Never Too Far' album was out and the, the Japanese version for Japanese Blue Note [Blue Note Records] of this jazz record was out and we were in his car and I wanted him to hear it, "Like a Lover," and "Like a Lover" is like eight min-, it's long (laughter) and, and it's not usually the thing that you wanna sit up and you know give a record executive, but I, I was real you know so I said, "I really love this song and da, da, da, da, da, and listen to it."  And he listened to it, he was very patient.  He listened to it and he looked me and he said, "Do you wanna continue this way, or do you wanna be a star?" in the back of this limousine, and I said, "I wanna do both," and that was basically the end of the conversation.  About a week later the 'Never Too Far' album just started falling off the charts, and it was over.  It was the wrong answer.  It was the right answer for me, I never regretted saying that because I've always been very, very happy with the music that I'm doing, that I you know was able to maintain my voice and, and select the music that I wanted to sing and that was something that was kind of supported, was actually supported by Bruce Lundvall because he used to tell me, "I'll never get in your way, you do what it is you think is right.  I will always suggest songs that I would love to hear you sing, but you don't have to do them."  So, he kind of, it was like a precedent was set.
Story_ID: 520508
Speaker 1: So, okay that record ['Never Too Far'] just falls off the charts, and it was--what?
Speaker 2: Oh, before we leave it I just want to go back and--there's a story around the song "Fumilayo" that's kind of interesting, [HistoryMaker] George Duke and Miles Davis, can you tell--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well he was doing the 'Tutu' album, Miles was doing the 'Tutu' album, and he wanted George to write a song and he heard "Fumilayo," but George had written it for me and I was writing lyrics to it, so he kept calling George, you know, "Man, I really want that song.  You know that song," and George was like, "All right," you know, "I'll write you another one, but I, you know I wrote this you know for [HistoryMaker] Dianne Reeves," and so this kind of went on and then he would laugh, he's like, "You know this song is good you know if Miles wants it."  And the thing that I loved you know Miles, it was Miles Davis, you know I'm just cousin, "Cuz, you mind if I give this song?" I would've said, "Yeah, go ahead," you know but that wasn't who George was you know.  And so I ended up you know doing the song "Fumilayo" and very, very successful.
Story_ID: 520509
Speaker 1: I was at the Saratoga festival [Newport Jazz Festival-Saratoga], at that time it was me, Miles [Miles Davis], and Santana [Carlos Santana] and I was--I opened, then it was going to be Miles 'cause he never wanted to be last and Santana was at the end and Dougal [Dougal Taylor] was playing drums at the ti- at that time.  Anyway, I remember being on stage and because of my experience with Sergio Mendes now all of these rhythms, Brazilian rhythms, African rhythms are now a part of my music and you know I danced a lot and I had this amazing percussionist, Ron Powell, who had come out of Sergio's, I mean--yeah Sergio's band [Sergio Mendes and Brasil '88] and Ron was this amazing percussionist from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  His, his brother was an Olympian, Michael Powell [Mike Powell], and Ron you know he knew how to do things with the pandeira, he knew all of the things, he went to Brazil and learned--he could have it rolled down his shoulders, he'd dancing.  So we had this thing together that we would do and Miles had never really, really heard of me, and I remember we're on stage and he's standing behind the stage with a microphone for the entire show taping this whole thing you know and we're dancing and I'm--you know, knowing that he's back there, I'm like singing everything I know, you know it's gotta be right and everybody's playing at like this incredible level 'cause he's standing on stage, I mean you could see him.  So, afterwards, after my show you know they changed and everything so he tells somebody I wanna meet her.  So, I walk to the door and I'm eating an apple and he comes to the door just as I'm getting to swallow a piece of the apple and it goes down the wrong tract and I'm standing at the door and he's looking at me and I'm going--and he looks at my friend, David Torkanowsky, he was my pianist who's from New Orleans, Louisiana.  We worked together for that period; he was extraordinary.  He said, "She's choking."  He looked at me and said, "She's choking?" (Laughter) You know.  So David you know helps me get it out and I'm trying to maintain my cool and I'm standing up there having choked in front of--literally, in front of Miles and then I look at him and he says, "Where are you from?"  I said, "I'm from Denver [Colorado]," and he looked at me really funny, you know, "Denver, Colorado," and he went and then when he looked at me like that I said, "but I was born in Detroit [Michigan]," he's like, "Oh," you know.  And he said, he looked at me and he said, "Where did you get that pitch?"  And it struck me really funny 'cause I'd never had anybody ask me, and I didn't exactly know what he was talking about.
Story_ID: 520510
Speaker 1: We talked and laughed, and then you know it was time for him to get on and there's another festival that is near, that is part of Saratoga [Newport Jazz Festival-Saratoga].  They would book their acts together and I saw him at the next festival a couple of days later, but I was asking my piano player [David Torkanowsky], I was like, "What is he talking about," you know, "where did you get that pitch?"  He's saying, he said, "Oh, we always talk about it," he said, "You seem so perfectly in tune," that's what he was talking about.  And I said, "Really?"  He said, "Yeah," and I never knew that you know, but the other thing is you know musicians like him, you know like Miles [Miles Davis]--he just went straight to the thing you know.  You know something I didn't even, straight to something that was my essence that I didn't even know, that I took for granted, that I wasn't even aware of.  It was just the way I sang, never thought about it, never had anybody to tell me you know you're out of--you know you're a little flat, a little sharp, never had that.  So, it never was a thing, so that was my, that was like a major thing that I had that I didn't even know and that was the things he picked up on.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and people always, I mean a lot of people we've interviewed speak to, they're students of Miles Davis--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and they say, they always say good thing about him.  I haven't heard one bad comment.  I mean you hear somebody read a lot of bad press about him (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I've never heard one bad thing about Miles Davis--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was pretty amazing, and he said, and he also said, "I didn't think you were from the, from America," you know when I saw him the second time.  That's why he reacted the first time when I said Denver [Colorado], because he thought I was from some--he thought he was gonna, I was from some foreign country and you know at that time you know I, I improvised a lot more then than I do now and I did like a lot very rhythmic things and it was really comfortable for me because I lived with--having a great drummer and great percussionist was a part of my, you know essential part of my sound at the time and the reason being is because I liked to be able to you know sing and play off of them.  People would say, you know, "What is the most important instrument in your band at that time?"  It was percussion, you know.
Speaker 2: I see so he's talking about pitch.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And you're talking about rhythm--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --being important to you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, yeah and that's where I--
Speaker 2: --that's the thing that you see.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's where I was you know, never thinking, never, ever thought about pitch.  Never heard it and people used to ask me, "Do you have perfect pitch?"  And I'd go, "No, really good relative pitch, but not perfect pitch."
Speaker 2: It's interesting, now we, from what I understand your voice is considered a contralto voice, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, you are supposed to have a three and a half octave range?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And now what does that--I mean, to the laymen, that is (laughter).  It probably means it sounds good but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, it's like one really strong octave be- from C to the C below and two octaves, two and a half octaves above middle C, um-hm, so and I don't sing as high as I used to, I probably have three octave range now (laughter) but I still sing a lot of the songs that I did back then in th- I can still sing them in the same key, which is kind of cool you know.

Speaker 1: Yeah, so during that, that period of you know 1989 now you know I have these musicians that are coming out of New Orleans [Louisiana], the first one being David Torkanowsky, and I'd heard about him and, and my sound is becoming more electric.  So, there are all these--and see I came up at a time when--you know jazz musicians did everything and they you know the jazz musician that you would swing with you know at a club was the same musician that was you know playing some you know Brazilian or Cuban person's music or some R&B s- or pop music and playing in the style and not playing like they didn't know but playing like they've been there all their lives.  You know what I'm saying?  So, they could play everything and you had musicians who played great electric bass and acoustic bass, which I love 'cause I loved having both, 'cause I still was you know integrating the, the straight tradition with other stuff so I like to be able to switch back and forth.  I've never been a singer that had any kind of--you know I never wrote a song--just learn all my songs and when they feel a certain way I wanna be able to do it then and I wanna be able to co-create on stage and that whole idea came from my exposure to Betty Carter, who you know would create new things every night.  So, I wanted to be able to be that, that kind of free, and so I had musicians who could do everything and here was like this incredible acoustic pianist was steeped in the tradition of jazz, New Orleans jazz, played with singers, really understood a lot of things and was like proficient in all of these you know keyboards, and, and we you know we would make these, you know like huge arrangements and then walk on stage and it was just you know all of these kinds of things and lot of traditional jazz people you know they would just shake their heads and then I'll never forget while I was on Blue Note [Blue Note Records] during this time after doing 'Never Too Far' I was happy with it.  Bruce [Bruce Lundvall] didn't have a problem with it.  They signed Gonzalo Rubalcaba and they were presenting him in New York [New York] at this event and they wanted me to do a song with him and the jazz police were--critics were in an uproar that they put this pop singer with this great you know jazz pianist.  And you know, here that thing was again, but fortunately you know working with Bruce Lundvall, I had him and I could continue to do and create and you know so from--I did all of those records all the way up to when there was a change in the mid-'90s [1990s] for Blue Note and Capitol [Capitol Records] and EMI [EMI Records].
Story_ID: 520512
Speaker 1: My original contract was on EMI [EMI Records] C- and Blue Note [Blue Note Records] went to Capitol [Capitol Records], and I was stuck on EMI. I was there in a place where there--it wasn't about jazz at all and really, really for the first time being afraid for my recording life and ended up doing the album 'Art and Survival,' and I remember the head of the record company at the time told me if I continued to do records like this that he would have to send me back to Blue Note, and I just sat there frozen 'cause that's what I wanted and because you know I did that record I ended up back on Blue Note, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Art of Survival' [sic.] (laughter), why the name?  At this point you were actually feeling--
Speaker 1: Because--exactly you know, it's like, how do you, you know it was the question of on this record I wanted to do a 'cause--let me back up.  Up to that point I was out there and I was doing my thing, but I always had this dual relationship with myself it was [HistoryMaker] Dianne Reeves the singer, and Dianne Reeves the person and the singer had dwarfed the person, I mean everything was being fed to my art.  I was growing by leaps and bounds artistically but you know, but me you know it wasn't, it didn't feel like that.  So I always--I started to feel like I was hiding behind my music and you know it, it got to be a real problem because it was hard for me to do interviews.  I didn't like to talk on the stage.  Up to that point, I wasn't really talking on stage.  If I had to talk on stage I would create a vamp because I could always sing and improvise what it is I would say.  So, just like I'm sitting here talking to you, I'd be singing this because the, the scariest place for me on stage was between songs.  So, that's why I ended up with long vamps on songs and then that would hurry up and get me to the next thing.  Sometimes, I would start the next song within that vamp to go to the next thing to avoid the space of actually talking to people.  And so, interviews I was very uncomfortable doing, because I was d-, you know I was living in the music and I was just doing what I felt and you know I could define it musically, but I couldn't define it really emotionally.  I couldn't really, really tell you, you know why you know.
Story_ID: 520513
Speaker 1: So when I did 'Art and Survival' that record to this day I have no idea what happened to that album because it was, it was an album that established me in a certain kind of way.  It was, it was an album of strength.  I just came in and sang what it was that I was feeling.  I did Abbey Lincoln's "Bird Alone."  I wrote most of the music on the--the music and lyrics on the record.  I did a song called "Endangered Species" is on that record (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's, that's what I've got a note about.  What--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I did a song called "Old Souls" that talked about my spiritual life.  So, all the things that I felt like were the, the subtext of the things that I was performing, those are the things that I put nakedly out on the record and that's what 'Art and Survival' was like, if--how will I survive after putting my real feelings and thoughts down you know will I be okay?  And while you know a lot people were like, "Were you depressed?  This record is--," da-da, you know I mean people were, you know it was the most interesting period of my life and it was the period of my life that made me the strongest and I remember I did an arrangement of--we did--Eddie [Eduardo Del Barrio] did an arrangement of "Body and Soul" and the arrangement is, is--the singing is really big and strong and the phrasing is very, very long.  It was one of the last albums that Kenny Kirkland did 'cause he was on that album as well, and it's, had long vamps and you know and we were, we decided not to end anything.  If it was long that's what you know, songs were like, ten minutes long, didn't care.  You know this was my journey, if this was my last record I'm putting everything in and I remember (laughter) Betty Carter calls me up and she says, "How could you do that song like that?"  And I said, "What do you mean?"  "You're so angry on that song."  And I hadn't, I used to go see her all the time and Ora [Ora Harris] who worked with her she said, "Betty would come off stage and say that girl is out there," (laughter) 'cause I would see her and Shirley Horn (gesture) like that, just anytime she was there and had all her records and I said, I said, "Because I wanted to own my feelings about what I did."  I said, "It's not a place of anger, it's a place of strength."
Story_ID: 520514
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well tell, tell us something about Betty Carter.  She's somebody who hasn't been mentioned much in this collection, I don't believe, so.
Speaker 1: Betty Carter was so extraordinary.  I ended, ended up using a lot of musicians that I always say went to her university.  My pianist [David Torkanowsky] today worked with Betty Carter.  The thing I loved about her, she, you know she was very, very hard and she really was clear about what it was she was saying to you, whether you know and, and you had the opportunity to stand up for yourself and you could change your mind or you guys could walk away you know, you know disagreeing and it would be okay still, but she liked it--from me at least I got that I would stand up to her because I--she was the one in a lot of ways that gave me license to, to expand and to do the things that I you know felt would be appropriate for me and so we first came together talking because of the 'Art and Survival' album and because she was very, very taken aback by the way I did "Body and Soul," and I think she even wrote about it in the Detroit press [Detroit Free Press], and she even said some things, she did a critique of me and s- people would ask me, "How do you feel about that?" I said, "I love it because that means she's listening to me," you know and if there's anybody that you know I would love in that way to critique me is somebody who is actually out there doing it, because now I know I have access to you and we can talk about it.  So, I, I viewed it as a compliment that I was worthy enough for her to talk about, and so you know I did the song.  We would see each other on the road and you know we would talk and you know she was, she didn't have a chip on her shoulder, she was really--she was real and she wanted to make sure you were gonna be real.
Story_ID: 520515
Speaker 1: There's a young man that is a saxophone player from here in Denver [Colorado].  His name is Javon Jackson and he was doing a record ['When The Time Is Right'] and he worked with Betty [Betty Carter], they were very good friends and he had asked her to produce his record and he knew that I loved her and he said, "Would you do the record?"  You know I was like, "Betty producing?  I love you too, but absolutely," I really wanted to be a part of it.  So, you know I came very prepared because you know I just, wherever we were gonna work from, I wanted to work from a place that she knew that I knew what I was doing and we did the first song--'Reflections' keeps coming back in my mind, but that wasn't the song.  It's a Gigi Gryce song, it'll come to me.  So, I did the song and there was silence on the other side and I'm like, oh, god this is worse than you know, so then all of a sudden I hear her say, "Come and listen to it."  I go in and listen and she looks at me, she says, "Well, change the second verse up a little bit," and I said, "Okay" and that was it, so you know I left it in--Javon was talking about you know that she was blown away because I had nailed it on the first take.  But we rehearsed it you know.  I was like this is Betty Carter up in this booth you know, you'd better be ready.  So, I remember telling Bruce Lundvall the experience was really incredible and that maybe--I was thinking about this next project that I wanted to do.  You know I would like for her to produce some of the songs on that record 'cause it was a record that I wanted to produce myself, and so he called her and told her that I wanted her to produce my whole record.  I was like, Bruce.  So, she called me she said, "I hear you want me to produce your record?"  I said, "Yes, Ms. Carter, I actually want you to do maybe half of the record 'cause I have some ideas for the rest of it."  And so, she said, "I don't do half of anything," and so we got into this really strong conversation and it was, you know, she would come at me, and I would come back and you know and I would quote you know certain songs that she did and I would say, "I did it because you know you did this."  I said, "You--," I said, "I got my license," and I told her, "to do what I do because of you.  I've seen you on stage so many times and I've seen you do the same things and every time it's different and I've seen you shape and change and you know in the moment songs.  And I've seen you listen to your musicians and them listen to you and create you know other places you know so that's you know what I wanna do, not like you but like me," you know and she said, "I'm gonna call you back, I'm going to pick up my Range Rover and I'll call you when I get back," (laughter), and she called me back and we talked f- well that conversation was two hours and the next conversation was about two or three hours and all we did was talk about music and life and, and all, you know just everything and you know I think not too long after that she was ill, and I remember seeing her at the North Sea Jazz Festival [the Netherlands] right before she died and we got a chance to talk a little, a little bit then.  She'd already been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and then she passed away.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's (unclear), yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  On her own terms too.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's iconic every- you know, real strong personality (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, my god.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 520516
Speaker 1: You were close to Cannonball [Cannonball Adderley] and Nat Adderley [Nat Adderley, Jr.] too, right?
Speaker 2: Well, no, I didn't know Cannonball, I mean George [HistoryMaker George Duke] worked with Cannonball, I remember--I mean I loved his music, but and he was one of the instrumentalists that I would listen to that really you know, I could see pictures when he you know through his compositions and they, they reminded me of a place and a time or a lifestyle of you know African Americans in the South or, or you know his music for me was kind of cinematic and I could--my imagination could go and I could see things in his music and so when I did the 'Quiet After the Storm' album which came right after 'Art and Survival'--and the storm was 'Art and Survival'--that's when we did the "Country Preacher" ["The Benediction (Country Preacher)"] and Joe Zawinul of course you know wrote that song and I called him, I asked him, "Would you mind if I wrote a lyric to it?" because you know once again, this is another one of his presentations that you know you, you hear it, you know you hear what's going on and can I narrate it through a lyric, and he, and Joe was just very, very s- kind and you know said, "Absolutely," and of course George had worked with Cannonball and at the end of that song we said and the church says "Ah, ooh" 'cause he said that's what Cannonball used to say all the time was, "Ah, ooh" you know, like--kind of like amen but ah, ooh, so that's why we ended it that way and so it was our tribute to him with, as George would say, with Cannonball making a ghostly appearance, 'cause he's on there, we used the tracks from the original.
Story_ID: 520517
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So then continuing on and on Blue Note [Blue Note Records] and the next thing--I do this album called 'Bridges,' which now you know is in a place that I, you know have been able to take the electric music, acoustic music and this is the sound that I've wanted and the 'Bridges' album really established that for me.  Then right after the 'Bridges' album I did the album, 'In the Moment' ['In the Moment: Live in Concert'] and it featured music from the 'Bridges' album.
Speaker 2: Now, this is special because it's live, right?
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: Recorded live?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: This one, 'In the Moment.'
Speaker 1: Yes, and 'In the Moment' was live, two days at SIR Studios [Studio Instrument Rentals] in Los Angeles [California].  There's actually a video component of it that was never released that the Savannah school of the arts [Savannah College of Art and Design, Savannah, Georgia] students did, it was pretty extraordinary, and so I, I did that record and that my first Grammy [Grammy Award].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then after that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So this is in 2000, right?
Speaker 1: Yes, in 2000.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then after that I started--during that time and the reason we released a live album is because at that time I was working on the music for the Sarah Vaughn album, 'The Calling' ['The Calling: Celebrating Sarah Vaughan'], and I remember that was a pretty, that was a--oh. It was a very, very hard process, and not musically speaking.  At this point now, you know Billy Childs is, you know we, he knows me like the back of his hand.  I know him, I--he has a particular harmonic vocabulary that you know I, you know we came together and we had been working together since we were like nineteen, twenty years old, and--get down--yeah.  And so, I want him to write the--you know we're, we're getting together and he's--we're working on the, the arrangements for this record and we have--when we do it we have a budget that we only have three days to record, to actually record the record 'cause it's with orchestra and I remember they had another, there was another guy that was doing some of the arrangements on the record and I went out and I met with him and there were four songs that he was to do and I went out to Arizona and I met with him and sat at the piano and said, you know, "I'm doing 'Speak Low' and I hear it like this and you know I want it to be slow and moving like this Partido alto type samba, you know that's just moving," and you know it gave him the idea and he was really into salsa at the time, so he decided he would write a salsa arrangement of it, and one of the other arrangements, I forgot which other song it was, and I, I didn't, I liked two of the four arrangements that he did and the other two I, I was just like, "No," you know, and so here we are, they are really into him being on this record 'cause had done things with Marsalis [Wynton Marsalis] and you know he felt he was tried and true and they didn't want to give this kind of project to an unknown like Billy Childs and so, we--I end up telling Billy, "I don't know what's gonna happen, but these other two songs I would like for you to go on and start putting the arrangement together."
Story_ID: 520518
Speaker 1: So when I called the guy back and I said, "Look, these, this isn't what I want," he went off on me and he said, "I tell you what you want, I'm the arranger, and this is, you know, this is how I hear the song."  I said, "No, this is my record ['The Calling: Celebrating Sarah Vaughan'] and this is a collaborative you know experience and this is--I'm not hearing this and so, you know this is not gonna work for me."  He said, "Listen here, girlie," I was like, wow.  He said, "If I were Picasso [Pablo Picasso], would you tell me--would you tell Picasso what to do?"  I said, "Well, of course you're not Picasso, and this is my record and my voice and this is the way that I want to see this music to celebrate Sarah [Sarah Vaughan] and these two arrangements are not working for me."  So, that's when I immediately called Billy [Billy Childs] and told him to start working on those two songs, 'cause we had gone through 'em.  I was going through every arrangement and Billy would--you know I'd be walking down the streets of New York [New York] and Billy would call and say, "You know, I'm fascinating rhythm, I have (making sounds)," and I'm like, "No 'cause when I sing it I want to be able to do this, this, and this," maybe and you know we just discussed everything and this other gentleman we didn't discuss everything like that, he wasn't available like that.  So, he got so angry that he called the record company [Blue Note Records], and he tol- first, he called [HistoryMaker] George Duke and George said, "I do arrangements for, you know, Natalie Cole," and he started naming all of these people and he said, "these arrangements have to fit them, they're the ones that have to live with them every night and if they're not right, they're wrong."  That's what George used to always say.  He said, "So if she's not feeling that I understand that, man, you know."  So, he called the record company.  He told the record company and now the record company is up in arms and they want to hear Billy's arrangements, the record company.  They're asking me to send the scores.  So, I send the scores.  Nobody in the company reads music, they just look at the scores and say, "It's too many notes."
Story_ID: 520519
Speaker 1: Now this is serious, you're serious?
Speaker 2: I'm serious, this was--they looked at it and they said, "This is just too many notes," and it was like all this pressure.  "This guy's a star," but I said, "This guy, it's not his record ['The Calling: Celebrating Sarah Vaughan'].  If it was his record I would do it his way, but this is my record," and so th- it was a huge fight and we had, the day was coming up George [HistoryMaker George Duke] had jumped in, the day was coming up when we had to go in and do it, where I ended up doing two of the arrangements of his which were "Key Largo" and "Exactly Like" ["Exactly Like You"], not "Exa-," the one that features Clark Terry ["I Hadn't Anyone 'Til You"], oh, god--anyway, so we end up you know going in the studio.  It's George Duke behind the glass.  It's Patrick Gandy, this wonderful African American conductor who is conducting, Billy Childs, Mulgrew Miller, sometimes Romero Lubambo on guitar and Russell Malone on guitar and we have three days to put this stuff down.  And we're doing it all live, these arrangements that never heard and several people who knew that I was doing this, this whole project started sending me videos of Sarah [Sarah Vaughan] which was really, really nice and we find out half the string players in the session that were contracted, played with her.  So, they all had stories and, and one of the record company execs [executives] sent in to listen to the session and the session is magic, it's just amazing.  The music is amazing and we get it done, you know.  There was one point where Patrick wasn't there and George came from behind the, you know, glass and he conducted the orchestra and there was another point when Billy conducted the orchestra.  I mean it was just, we had to get it done in three days and it was the do- the actual process in doing the music was probably one of the highlights of my life and we got it done and it went on to win the next Grammy [Grammy Award], and the people loved fascinating rhythm which was like the bone of contention in the--with the record company [Blue Note Records].  They liked it so much that I ended up being a part of the--I think it was the 19-, I mean the 2001 Olympics, the Winter Olympics in Utah [2001 Winter Olympics, Salt Lake City, Utah], and I did it with Scott Browning and that particular arrangement. From that point on now my life is not only working with my trios, but also now I'm doing you know big orchestra dates and you know that's, that's what was happening at that time--
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) around the world, yeah.
Speaker 1: Around 2002, so you're doing a lot of touring?
Speaker 2: Yeah, touring, uh-huh, working with all kinds of you know wonderful orchestras all over the world.  So that was, it was new for me.  It was a whole new place to create in, I'd never had an experience like that and you know it cont- it actually continues, it's still continuing.  It's still doing a lot of it.
Story_ID: 520520
Speaker 1: Now you won a Grammy Award for 'A Little Moonlight' too in 2004 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'A Little Moonlight' that was, Arif Mardin produced that record, won a Grammy for that and then right after that, I think it was 2004, this idea of doing the movie, 'Good Night, and Good Luck' came into being and the reason was because--oh, gosh, back in the early 2000s, I'd done this concert with Rosemary Clooney and we shared a dressing room.  We laughed and talked the whole time and you know listen to each other perform and it was just, you know it was just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now is this Rosemary Clooney who was in 'White Christmas' and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Who is the aunt of, of--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Of George Clooney.
Speaker 2: Of George Clooney.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And that, when I asked him why he selected me to be in his movie, he said, "Because of my aunt."  You know, so I thought wow, you just never know who's listening. And the thing that I loved about the film--well, let me just back up a little bit.  Prior to that, in I'd say in 2002, I had done the same kind of film called 'Guilty by Suspicion' that was also about the McCarthy [Joseph McCarthy] era, and that was with Robert De Niro, and I sat at the piano but it was actually Jimmy Rowles playing and I sang a song called "Easy Come, Easy Go" in a nightclub, so that was the beginning, but this particular al- experience, George Clooney selected all of the music for the film.  He wrote the film, and the music kind of served as a, you know, like a kind of relief from the tensions of the fi-, of the film and also you know gave a whole different read on, on the, the lyrics of the songs, and the thing that I loved about it was that I performed the songs live in the film, and they were representative of all of the great jazz singers that I had listened to.  It was a very period-oriented piece so it allowed me to sing in that period and it was, it was, it was an amazing experience, and from that we did the album, 'Good Night, And Good Luck,' and I--at that time, it was near the end of my, it was at the end of my contract with Blue Note [Blue Note Records] and things were changing.  Blue Note was kind of in a different place because now Norah Jones is selling like stupid records for a jazz label, and everybody is high on that.  You know, god bless her, but now they're not trying to you know sell, now they wanna be in that you know and it was the only label that was a part of that whole family that was selling records like that.  So, the, the energy started to change and so when I was offered to do this, we came up with this idea and talked to George Clooney and said you know, "Let's do a soundtrack album," and so of course I went to Blue Note first and I said, you know, "Would you guys be interested in doing this album for this film, and I think it's gonna be pretty good," and I remember Ge- Bruce Lundvall's exact words to me were, "It's not gonna be big, so no, we're not interested."  I thought, wow, okay.  So, Norman Lear who was heading Concord Records at the time said, "I wanna do this record," and so we ended up recording the record.  Very, very successful, brought a whole new audience into my life, and this particular record also won a Grammy.
Speaker 1: Right, soundtrack, um-hm (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, so it was three records that I put out in a row that won for this you know over that period of time won, one after the other.
Story_ID: 520521
Speaker 1: Did you switch recording companies at that time or were you still--?
Speaker 2: At that time, I still had one more record to do with Blue Note [Blue Note Records], is the 'When You Know' record, which you know, a lot of people know about, a lot of people don't--it was just you know fulfilling the con- contractual obligation and then, after, between that period and, and after 'When You Know' then I started doing other things you know outside of recording and that's when I got involved with 'Sing the Truth!' in that period where you know it started out with myself, Angelique Kidjo, Lizz Wright and Nina Simone's daughter, Simone [Lisa Simone], and we went out and we celebrated the music of Nina Simone for the first 'Sing the Truth!' installment and it was really powerful.  We--it was powerful because everybody came with songs, nobody (laughter) had picked anybody else's songs 'cause the repertoire was so vast, and, and we all even had backup songs for when we wanted to you know change it up while we were out because the tour lasted.  It ended up going for almost two years and it, it was amazing.  We toured all over the world with that and we liked it a lot and then Simone decided she was gonna start pursuing the music of her mother more aggressively.  She dropped out and so it was me, Angelique and Lizz and we decided to do another 'Sing the Truth!' and that was the music of you know the people that had inspired us, so it would be Odetta [HistoryMaker Odetta Gordon], Abbey Lincoln you know just a very broad variety of, of singers, women artists, [HistoryMaker] Terri Lyne Carrington was the musical director of that and you know we, we took that on tour and that lasted another year, year and a half, (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now these are educational projects--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --as well as artistic projects?
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Now, you just really think about a lot of people know about these artists because of what you all do--
Speaker 2: Really (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) there's no doubt about that, yeah.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you've got a new generation coming up all the time, they don't know who--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's true.
Speaker 1: --Nina Simone is.
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly, they know who she is now.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So on the Nina Simone album, what song did you--I saw you all singing "Four Women" together (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we did--at the end of the show.  I did really interesting things like I sang "But Beautiful," I did of course, "Be My Husband."  I was always switching it up because there was so many things that she did that I loved, so it was a lot of different things, "My Ship," what else did I do, gosh, there was a lot of stuff, but yeah it was--the thing that I loved--and each night we all sang, I guess we each sang maybe three or four tunes and we did a lot of duets together.  Um-hm.
Story_ID: 520522
Speaker 1: I was surprised to see Angelique Kidjo in that group.  I know a lot of the music from Mali, the straight up African music from Mali--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but I was surprised to see her in there ['Sing the Truth!'].
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, Angelique is interesting.  Actually, she's from Benin, and the interesting about her, I discovered her one time in a Tower Records, and I just wanted to buy something different and there was this woman looking at me from a record, so I picked it up and it was her first record, and you know had never met her, and then we met down in Bermuda, we were on the same show and we've been like sisters ever since.  It's like I have a lot of things in my house, it's scary when people see them, and she's like a little itty bitty thing.  I have fabrics and, and artwork and all kind of things and she has the exact same pieces and same fabrics and I mean it's like, it's unbelievable, and so we would just look at each other and go--and so we, she's been a constant friend, and she's an extraordinary person.  She's so wonderful.  She, I've never seen anybody you know work so tirelessly like she does, you know, and she's on that stage she just like--I thought I had a lot of energy until I met her, and I'd never seen anything like it.

Speaker 1: We were talking about the second 'Sing the Truth!' tour and album and so the artists on that tour that were featured were--?
Speaker 2: Abbey Lincoln, Odetta [HistoryMaker Odetta Gordon], Joni Mitchell--we're, were still doing some things of Nina Simone's and more contemporary artists like, wait, what is her name?  Oh, we did things by Joan Armatrading.  It was, it was just an array of musicians that and singers and songwriters that really, really kind of affected a change in us.  Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so that's what they all had in common?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was and they were mostly songwriters, yes, and were singing their repertoire.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Tracy Chapman, she was another one.  I did, actually did a song of hers.
Story_ID: 520524
Speaker 1: Tell us about the Abbey Lincoln Tribute ['Kennedy Center Jazz Presents: A Tribute to Abbey Lincoln'].
Speaker 2: When Abbey Lincoln passed, she had a great, you know she had a major effect on myself, on [HistoryMaker] Dee Dee Bridgewater and Cassandra Wilson, and when she passed away we decided you know that we needed to come together and celebrate her legacy in music, and you know we all, once again she had so many, many songs that everybody could select things and you know was, nobody got in any--in each other's way and so we did it at The Kennedy Center [The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Washington, D.C.].  It was a very, very powerful experience, really a one night tribute to her.  People wanted us to you know keep on going with it, but it just happened that you know everybody had stuff and we couldn't you know put it together, to actually tour with it.  So, it was a one, one night affair, but so recently we have decided to, to do it again.  We'll do it in three places in 2017.  It's still being worked out, but people will know, you know where it's going to be.  I know one of the places is The Kennedy Center, and we will be--but this time it will be myself, Dee Dee Bridgewater and Esperanza Spalding, [HistoryMaker] Terri Lyne Carrington will be the musical director and probably Geri Allen on piano.
Speaker 1: It's just really chilling to think back to a time when Abbey Lincoln and Nina Simone were all alive at the same time.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know (unclear) it seems like it's not real (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's just like you know Sarah [Sarah Vaughan], Ella [Ella Fitzgerald], you know Dinah Washington and Carmen [Carmen McRae], you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That was pretty powerful and seeing pictures of all of them of, of you know like Dinah, Sarah and Carmen together.  So, it's pretty amazing.
Speaker 1: Now, I would suggest that people see you and Cassandra Wilson and Dee Dee Bridgewater in a si- similar (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And there are a lot of pictures of us you know to-, you know of us together.
Story_ID: 520525
Speaker 1: Well tell us about 'Beautiful Life.'
Speaker 2: Well, 'Beautiful Life' is my most rege- re- recent--can't even talk, I think I'm getting tired--most recent project and it was really in--a lot, some of it was inspired by the two Mosai-, by the one 'Mosaic Project' ['The Mosaic Project'] that [HistoryMaker] Terri Lyne Carrington did, she used you know all women musicians on her album but the thing that I loved was the collaborations and during that time in the--like, you know it wasn't that long ago, but I could feel you know 2011, '12 [2012], ' 13 [2013] you know a lot of the, the young jazz musicians were referencing the music that I came up on.  So, I thought, wow, this is a great neutral ground to come together you know because I understand what they're saying because they're speaking, even though they're doing it in a more contemporary way, I, I know this music.
Story_ID: 520526
Speaker 1: I had this idea of taking you know, a lot of the music that I, I grew up listening to as well as songs that I would write and, and some jazz standards and, and have them arranged in a way that allowed for a collaboration with the musicians, a lot of the musicians that were on the record and the first one that came around was Robert Glasper, who actually hit me up on te- on Twitter and said, you know, "I've always wanted to work with you and you know I have this idea of this song, this song, "Dreams,"" and I couldn't even believe that he even knew that song, you know Fleetwood Mac, and so I said, "Okay, I wanna hear it," 'cause I like the song, and he sent me the arrangement.  It was so fresh and so you know cool, I thought absolutely.  So, he ended up being on the record and you know by that time Gregory Porter was you know starting to make you know a big, big splash and we did "Satiated" ["Satiated (Been Waiting)"] and he sat in on that.  Lalah Hathaway did "Waiting in Vain" and Gregoire Maret you know was on the record ['Beautiful Life'], I mean it was just--Richard Bona played on the record.  It was, it was amazing you know working with all, some of them I had already worked with but to and then of course the last, it was the last thing that George [HistoryMaker George Duke] did outside of his record was on that.  We had just performed at Carnegie Hall [New York, New York], Lalah--it was 'Dianne Reeves and Friends.'   Lalah was on the concert and so we were recording and doing the Carnegie Hall date at the same time and you know Lalah is just--oh, my god, I think she's so extraordinary and she just, you know put magical things on the record.  So, it was exciting because I loved all the colors that this record has on it and it was you know the musicians from my band and then I think the greatest gift on the record was a song that was given to me for Christmas by Esperanza Spalding, which was "Wild Rose."
Speaker 2: And your cousin George Duke was on this one too (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I meant George Duke, I keep saying George, but yes, George Duke is on "Feel So Good" and you know like I said, we had just done a concert at Carnegie Hall with 'Dianne Reeves and Friends' and George Duke was--it was the last time we worked together.
Story_ID: 520527
Speaker 1: He [HistoryMaker George Duke] passed in 2013 I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right?  All right.  So--
Speaker 2: In August, almost a year and a week, and just a week before--almost to the time that his wife had passed a year before.
Speaker 1: That seems unreal 'cause we met them both when we did their interview about five years ago.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and you know how she was, she was pretty--you know.  I used to say, "That's your wife-a-tery [ph.]," Corine [Corine Duke] would take care of everything.  They were everything together and she passed and that next year within a week of her passing, the next year he passed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your uncle is still living here, [HistoryMaker] Charles Burrell (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uncle's still here in Denver, Colorado.
Speaker 1: Does he still perform every now and then?
Speaker 2: A little bit, he's not as strong as he was.  He still drives.  He's ninety-four, no I'm sorry, he's ninety-six, my uncle, my other uncle Joseph Burrell is ninety-five, so yeah, he's still you know, keeps it going.  I mean he's had some--in recent, in recent weeks, he's had some health challenges, but his spirits are high and you know he still continues to do the best with what he has to work with which is another thing my mother [Vada Burrell Swanson] used to always say.
Story_ID: 520528
Speaker 1: When did your mother pass away?
Speaker 2: My mother passed in 2010, it's been--what is it?  No, wait a minute I'm sorry, this is '16 [2016]?  Eleven [2011], yeah.
Speaker 1: You mentioned earlier she constantly was a source of advice and strength (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother had a mind like a, like a steel trap, I mean she remembered things from when--I think her earliest memories were two years old and my mother had this ability to remember conversations, she knew the exact words that people said and how she responded.  She had like this kind of photographic kind of memory and she was an amazing storyteller.  She, like I said she was very much a part of the community and people, man, people loved her.  When she ended up in the--in the final stages of her life and she was in the care facility because she had breast cancer, then it returned.  She also had COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease] and a GI [gastrointestinal] stromal tumor in her stomach, so she had three different kinds of cancer.  Her mind was always intact and I remember very clearly the day that they told her, it was a Saturday, she said, they said, "We--there's nothing else we can do for you."  I mean she's a nurse, she knew exactly what that meant, and she sent everybody away that Saturday, that--I didn't--she's like, "Please leave" you know, "you guys go on, just let me have this day."  And I, I remember coming back early that next morning, Sunday morning, and she had a list of everything that she wanted done at, for her transition, and how she wanted it done, the music she wanted to have, I mean she just went through all of this and told us how she wanted to do it and my sister [Sharon Hill-Washington] is, you know they, they said your mother will go into palliative care, which to me sounded different than hospice.  I didn't really get what at that time probably was so numb that I couldn't, my mind couldn't get with what that meant so I thought that that meant you know she was still going to be receiving some sort of treatment, and I remember after that day my sister says you know, "Let's go and start getting things in order," and after they had told her, she was here for three weeks, and she died in May and the thing that was so extraordinary was streams of people came to her room at the health f- care facility to see her.  I mean it was just--it started nine o'clock in the morning, ended at six in the evening every single day, and I remember walking in at the facility and this lady grabbed me.  She said, "Who is that lady back there?"  I said, "That's my mother."  She said, "But who is she?"  I said, "She's my mother."  She said, "There's so many people going back."  Her brother that is from--in Detroit [Michigan], Joe Burrell [Joseph Burrell] sat with her every day.  It was always someone with her.  People would come and she would you know talk to them about their children, their birthdays, I mean she remembered everything and this, even new people would say, "Oh, Ms. Vada [Vada Burrell Swanson], you probably don't remember me?"  She said, "Yeah, you saved my life in the cafeteria," like, you know and they would just start crying 'cause they just couldn't believe it, and she started to sleep, but then you would think that she sleep and she'd you know open her eyes and continue the conversation and you know she you know, I mean for me and my sister we looked at that and well, when it's time to go I will not ever be afraid.  You know, she was this shining example of grace.  She lived in a state of grace and you know people were very, very thankful that she was in their lives, and I know I was.  I miss her (laughter) you know a lot, and--but I can hear her, you know.
Story_ID: 520529
Speaker 1: Now you don't have biological children do you at all?
Speaker 2: I don't have any children--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --just dogs (laughter).
Speaker 1: Just two dogs and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and a bunch of records.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have any projects or any mentoring projects that you are part that help young artists go forward and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, when--
Speaker 1: --or do you advise any specific ones?
Speaker 2: I do a lot of--like a lot concerts, I'll have a master class component if we're in a place where I can talk to students, and then I have you know I travel a great deal so I haven't settled down to start--I've been offered teaching jobs a lot and probably that's gonna happen you know, maybe sooner than later, but I love doing what it is that I do, but I have a lot of young singers that are still part of my life that, that I you know I still work with and am in touch with and mentor in--but no specific organization or anything like that that I'm a part of.
Story_ID: 520530
Speaker 1: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you, you enga- there may be other people that are doing it, you seem to engage in a lot of collaborative projects.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And within a variety--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --of different forms of music.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I love that because you know I always tell people I look at jazz as a passport into everything.  Jazz is a music that is very conscious of what the form, spirit and, and approach is you know.  So, a jazz musician can go in any situation and you know whether any kind of music situation and, and have, get some sort of understanding of what it is and then approach it in the way that it should be approached, and that's the thing that I love, and but I find with myself when I work with different people, I find other things about myself that I didn't even know, 'cause everybody has a particular skill set and the way that they approach the music and hear the music, be it rhythmically or they have their own harmonic vocabulary and you are put in a situation to create within this other voice and I love that because I always come back with more, and I always come back with a kind of strength having delved into it and, and you know been able to contribute something.
Story_ID: 520531
Speaker 1: Is there any particular musical expression that you're focused in or really tuned into now as (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You mean some, the people--what, the--well you know there's a lot of--
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the Brazilian you know that you were into at one time?  Or is there any--
Speaker 2: Oh, I see.  No, because now the music is so global that people you know, like people of Brazil you know they're listening to the music of I don't know, hip-hop music or and adding elements of you know all this world music or global experience to their music.  They're coming from where they are and adding these other things, and so, the whole world in a lot of ways is collaborating musically.  It's, it's really interesting right now.  There's a lot of you know pop music is out there, but I love, I'm more into the indie music below the surface, people that are doing all kinds of interesting things, not with just harmony, but I mean with music, but sonically they're doing music that is, has a cinematic type component you know, things that are--reach further, a lot further into other art forms even, and you, you find this in the music.  So, I'm loving hearing all of these kinds of things.  Some of it I don't understand but it's interesting and I would you know not be afraid to delve into it and some of it you know I get, I love that there are no you know standard music forms but there is a kind of form in the way that people create music, but it's not the form that I grew up with, with the ABBA or anything like that.  I mean that started breaking down in my generation anyway, but yeah I love it that there's this kind of other openness, but the one thing that I will say that is different is--and maybe it's because I'm not as involved in it you know, I'm looking at it from a place of you know my generation, but I love in my experience with music, I think I touched on a little bit that musicians could play everything, so you could move--I could easily move through a song and actually sing a different rhythm that my drummer would pick up on or you know outline another way to sing you know something that the harmonies would change and people respond in kind and the music could you know just evolve and change from night to night, and I find sometimes a lot of the music I hear, you know there's this kind of saneness and I'm sure that there's some stretching in a way that within this kind of way of presenting the music that I, maybe I'm not getting but that part of me, that part kind of leaves me in a place where I can't even, I don't understand, I can't engage.
Story_ID: 520532
Speaker 1: What project are you working on now, do you have something that you--?
Speaker 2: I just completed a live album in France getting ready to mix that and it's some of the songs from 'Beautiful Life' and some other things you know that I've been kind of messing around with and really excited to sing, and it also features Gregoire Maret on harmonica and then I'm in the process of working with a friend of mind to do some other kind--hearing the music in another kind of way and I don't generally talk about my projects as we're in the process of doing it, but hopefully you know I'll be able to be able to be in a studio early into mid-next year and we'll start working on the next thing.
Speaker 1: People won't see this for a couple of years probably you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, probably the interim piece will be this live record, yeah.
Story_ID: 520533
Speaker 1: Is there any artist you have not collaborated with or worked with that you would like to (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, there's, there's a lot (laughter).  You know, I'm just really, really open you know and if there's you know something like you know someone like Meshell Ndegeocello I think is amazing and I would love to someday be able to do something with her.  I think she's amazing.  I, I you know I like a lot of the young musicians that are out there.  I am, I'm a big fan of Kendrick Lamar. You know I loved--from his last record ['To Pimp a Butterfly'] I ended up listening to his first records and it was for me the first time I ever really delved that deep into any kind of hip-hop experience, and I think it's because there was a lot of cross-generational stuff that was in his music that spoke to me very, very clearly that drew me and said, you're welcome to come in and listen. And I found a lot of people my age were listening to it going wow.  And, feeling good that they could relate to it on a certain level.  So, I'm, I'm a big fan of his.
Story_ID: 520534
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: The biggest hope is that we can love and trust one another, and see each other and view each other's self- each other's worth.  We're a community that we recognize it, we recognize the spirit of the community.  Whenever we see it in any kind of art form, any kind of athletic experience we know this, you know this other sense of our self that is very, very powerful and strong and pulls us together that we can hear it in a voice but it would be nice if we could experience that more deeply as a community, you know to be able to really, strongly work together and look at each other and really love, love.  We love who we are but we don't always love each other you know, if that makes any kind of sense.  You know we love what we do but we don't always come together and, and continuously lift one another up, and then the other--the thing that I you know probably about--like the rest of the people in the United States, this election time you know wondering you know, you know where the world is going and what is, you know where are we at in, in the history of America and the rest of the world.  That is a big concern because America's always set a standard that the rest of the world has followed and the, it seems like the rabbit hole that we might be getting ready to go down right now is not one that I would want the rest of the world to follow.
Story_ID: 520535
Speaker 1: Today is the opening of the new African American museum [National Museum of African American History and Culture] on the Mall [National Mall, Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --which leads to a question that we always ask and that is, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As someone who totally owned and--totally owned their own voice, and was willing to not sell out because I've never sold out and that my music is honest and my music is about hope and uplifting and light and, and always moving forward.
Speaker 1: Okay. Is there anything I haven't asked you about that we need to talk about before we close?
Speaker 2: I think (laughter) we did a lot.  It's funny now you know the time is like oh, but yeah I'll probably think of something tomorrow, but right now I think we covered a lot of things, more than I've ever covered in one day about myself.
Speaker 1: Okay, well thank you for sharing.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
