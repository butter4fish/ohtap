Speaker 1: All right.  My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with the HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My name is Leo Austin Brooks.  That's spelled L-E-O, A-U-S-T-I-N, B-R-O-O-K-S.  I'm neither a senior nor junior.
Speaker 1: All right.  And sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Nine, August, 1932.
Speaker 1: And where were you born?
Speaker 2: I was born, actually, born in Washington, D.C. at Garfield Hospital, but from two days later, I lived in Alexandria, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And sir, what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: I am now fully retired.  I served a few months short of thirty years in the United States Army.  I was a city manager for almost two years and I was an independent consultant for three and then I fully retired.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And when you retired, what rank were you?
Speaker 2: At the time I was a major general, but since I retired before I had three years in grade I had to retire as a Brigadier General.  So my act of duty--last act of duty rank was major general.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And sir, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Beg your pardon?
Speaker 1: What is today's date?
Speaker 2: (Leaning over to hear).
Speaker 1: Today's date?
Speaker 2: Oh, today's date.  It's June the--July the 22nd, 2013.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: Right now we are in--at the Fairfax, which is a retirement community of mostly all military people in the southern end of Fairfax County, just south of Ft. Belvoir, Virginia.
Story_ID: 34171
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, sir, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we ask as kind of a warm up, and they only require a short answer.  The first question is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I don't have a favorite food.  I have several favorite foods.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Black and gold.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Combination.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Probably springtime.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  I go to Myrtle Beach to play golf in the spring, but having spent 30 years in the army, you get to go so many places, you know, you're not enamored with anyone.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one sir, is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I have several, one of which I take from Harry Truman, which is "The buck stops here" and the other is "I never take credit for success, I always give it to God".
Story_ID: 34172
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, separately, then we'll put them together, all right. Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name was Evelyn Lemon Brooks.
Speaker 1: And can you spell that for us.
Speaker 2: E-V-E-L-Y-N, L-E-M-O-N, B-R-O-O-K-S.
Speaker 1: And what was her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her place of birth was Warm Springs, Virginia, and her date of birth was June the 14th, 1908.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family, about the ancestors on that side, how far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: I can go a good ways back.  Her mother died when she was about 12 years old, leaving her as the oldest girl at home.  She was one of nine by the way, leaving her to raise or to be in charge of her three younger sisters.  In those days young people got married at 14, 15, 16 years old, so her two oldest sisters had already married, one went to Charleston, West Virginia, and the other one went to Steelton, Pennsylvania.  But her mother was from over in West Virginia, just across the--across the Virginian line, we're talking back up in the--up in the mountains near Hot Springs.  And her father was one of three, his name was Eckard; E-C-K-A-R-D, was the way you spelled it, Eckard Lemon.  His grandfather was a Irish doctor whose name was McCutchen(sp), and he had an African American--half African American, half Indian wife, whom he stood by and took care of throughout her life.  Their daughter's name was Mariah and Mariah was the mother of my grandfather, so I can go back that far on my--on my mother's family.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But my mother was number four--she was the number five out of nine.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you know what--what kind of work did your mother's family do?
Speaker 2: Well, they were farmers.  She had a brother who owned a cress lake.  It was one of the very few cress lakes in the United States, and the land is still there.  I saw it not long ago where they grew fresh watercress, and it was shipped all over the eastern United States.
Story_ID: 34173
Speaker 1: Watercress.  Okay.  I asked you what a cress lake was.   So it's a lake where you grow watercress?
Speaker 2: Yeah, what they did was they leveled off this area that was oh, about the size of a football field and dammed it at one end and flooded it, and then, of course, they grew cress there for years.  Course it's not--it's no longer there.  His name was Warren Lemon.
Speaker 1: Okay. And as a kid in the summertime, when we would go there, it would be interesting to go down to the cress farm and watch them load barrels of cress, big wooden stave barrels with cress and ice on it and load it on a truck.  They'd take it down to Covington, Virginia, and put it on a train, it'd go to New York City.  I remember seeing that as a kid, yeah.  But there was little or no work there.  The only work--the basic work for people who lived up in them mountains there was at the homestead, which is a resort or they might work in the paper mill down in Covington.  So most young women, many young women rather, would leave that are and come up to Washington [D.C.] or go to Philadelphia or someplace and do domestic work.  And a aunt of my mother's [Evelyn Lemon Brooks] encouraged her to leave, and she went to Philadelphia and worked out in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, for a family for a very short while.  And I may be jumping the gun here, but she went one night to a dance over in Chester, Pennsylvania, where she met my father [Houston George Brooks, Sr.].
Speaker 2: Now, let me ask, did your mother have a chance to finish school in Virginia before she moved?
Speaker 1: Up there in the mountains, they could only get to the sixth grade.  After she came to Pennsylvania, she went to night school.  And then when they subsequently moved back to the Alexandria, Washington area, she went to--there was a high school at night.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 34174
Speaker 1: So, I'm going to go back to how your parents met, you know in a minute, but I'm going to go over to your father's side, now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name is Houston,          H-O-U-S-T-O-N; George, G-E-O-R-G-E; Brooks, B-R-O-O-K-S, Senior.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth was December the 24th, 1904.
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Alexandria, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what can you tell us about his side of the family?
Speaker 2: I can trace his family back to the civil war times.  My great-grandfather whose name was Richard Henry Brooks, was a slave, and I hold a copy of his autobiography, which indicates that he escaped from a plantation near Culpeper, actually it was at Orange, and he ended up in Northern Virginia, where he was captured and put back into slavery up near Haymarket.  When the union army came through there, about the time of the first battle of Manassas, he jumped the plantation and went to work as a horse handler for a artillery officer--union artillery officer from Maine by the name of Freeman Magillavery(sp).  And--of course, he traveled with him for sometime during the war and then as the war got heavy in 1862, Magillavery had to send his family back to Maine.  In those days, you know, families traveled with officers.  Most of them were in Washington when they came across, and if you read the history of that battle, they came in wagons as if they were going to a picnic to see the first battle of Manassas [Virginia], of course the union was defeated at it.  But when the war became more involved, Magillavery sent his wife back to Maine with her brother--with his brother and with my great-grandfather driving the wagon.
Story_ID: 34175
Speaker 1: He [Richard Henry Brooks] stayed in Maine for two and half years until the war ended in 1865.  There she taught him to read and write, gave him a speller, put him in charge of the gardens that she--that they grew and sold, and the brother got him a job working in the shipyard there in Maine from which he developed some mechanical trades.  When the war was over, he came back, met his first wife and took her to Pensacola, Florida, where she died of yellow fever.  He came back to Alexandria where he met Mary Frances Smith, who was a free black and they bought a house at 725 S. Fairfax Street in Alexandria for $790, with 30 years to pay it.  They had five children, one of whom was my grandfather who was Henry Curtis.  That's H-E-N-R-Y,   C-U-R-T-I-S, BROOKS.  Of course he became a senior also.  And his wife died in childbirth of my father or so a few days thereafter, hemorrhaging.  My father was then raised by a family that lived two blocks away, the name of which was Day, I'm sorry was White, W-H-I-T-E, was the last name, and Sarah White was her name, and of course he, my grandfather, then took him when he became a young man, and they went to Pennsylvania to work in the shipyards.  He went to--he went to--in those days you had two schools in Alexandria, Snowden School and oh, it will come to me in just a moment, Hollowell(sp) School, for blacks, and they went--those schools went to the sixth grade and that was all you could get.  If you wanted any more, you went to Washington, D.C., and you were to go to one of the high schools there.  In those days they had Dunbar, Armstrong and Cardozo.
Story_ID: 34176
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your father go to school?
Speaker 2: He [Houston George Brooks, Sr.] also had to go to night school to get the rest of his education.  And then he continued in a program.  In those days the--they used to have the Baptist Minister's Institute, I think it was called, or something close to that, that ran for a month or so in the summers, and he went to that for several years.  During the early days of his life, he was--he and my grandfather [Henry Curtis Brooks], because of the depression had to leave Pennsylvania--leave the shipyard when the shipyard closed down, they came back to Alexandria.  My grandfather had an old truck and they would take the old truck and go along the Potomac River, drag in firewood, cut it and sell the firewood for income.  From that, and we still have two of the old saws that are about eight feet long with giant teeth and about an inch long teeth that they used to cross-cut that firewood.  They then progressed into floor sanding and then into interior decorating and exterior decorating.  And we were able to put five children through college and some graduate schools off of the earnings from their decorating business, my father and grandfather and I and each of my brothers when we hit the age of twelve, and when summertime came, we went to work in the business.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that today I or anyone of my brothers could effectively run a decorating business.
Speaker 1: So the decorating included painting, hanging wallpaper, that sort of thing and flooring, too?
Speaker 2: Yes, painting, paper hanging, minor carpentry, plastering and what not, preparing the walls and things of that nature, yes.  In 1938, when I was just a kid, about six years old, my father felt a call to the ministry and that's when he started that ministerial study and was ordained in 1940.  And just about two miles from where we sit right now was where his first church was, just out of the gates of the Gunston Hall Plantation.  It's called Shiloh Baptist Church, Shiloh of Gunston was his first church.  But he continued his secular work in decorating because he had five children.  And in order to see all five of them through undergraduate school and most of graduate school for them, he had to continue.  In those days ministers didn't make very much.  He would come home on Sunday night from his church around Christmastime, and he would have jars of canned venison and all sorts of things, and he would bring home the collection in a handkerchief, because most of it would be change, and I would always get the job to count the change, and it would be great when that handkerchief had as much as 20 to 25 dollars in it.  So that was--so he had to keep his secular work in order to take care of his family.
Story_ID: 34177
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now is the time to tell us the story of how your parents met?
Speaker 2: As I said, she, my mother [Evelyn Lemon Brooks] went to this dance in Chester [Pennsylvania], and of course, he being there working, was at the dance, and there they met.  About eight or nine months later they married, yeah.  And sometime after that my oldest brother was born there in Chester.  I was able to return my mother and father [Henry George Brooks, Sr.] to the scene of that birth.  While I was in Philadelphia, they came to visit me, and I took them over to Chester to see the old little two-story, about 10-room hospital, where my oldest brother was born.  But because--I said because of the depression and the work shut down in the shipyard, they came back to Virginia and lived for a while with my great-grandmother Mary Francis Smith-Brooks and--there in Alexandria, until they could get themselves together and then they moved to Washington [D.C.], and that's where they both continued school while he worked for a while.  And then--then they bought in 1929--1930, no 1929, just before the depression, it was, a home on Albert Avenue in Alexandria.  Albert Avenue is in a section of Alexandria called Sunnyside, and Sunnyside was a community developed by a black lawyer by the name of Montgomery Watson who practiced law in Washington, D.C., but who built  himself a lovely home and then developed the plots, the landscape, for development that was about two and a half blocks long and about two and a half blocks wide there in--on the north end of Alexandria.  At the time it was Orrington County.  Alexandria subsequently annexed that area.  And they bought a house there that someone else had lived in for a short while, and there they raised their family there.  And that community was an all black neighborhood.  We didn't get running water there until 1946, when the war was over.
Speaker 1: Was that typical for those days?
Speaker 2: Well, no.  Most of all of Alexandria had running water but it was a black community, so we didn't get any.  It wasn't until the war was over and the health people made them do something about it.
Speaker 1: Did you have like a--
Speaker 2: Well, it had wells and a couple of homes had wells and septic tanks, two houses had that.  The rest all had to have the scavenger to come and take away the toilet--
Speaker 1: --The sewage.
Speaker 2: --Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34178
Speaker 1: It sounds pretty typical for Virginia in those days in the black community you wouldn't have the kind of services you would have in--
Speaker 2: Well, unless you lived right in the heart of the city where they had to have it, yes, that was pretty typical.
Speaker 1: --Okay.
Speaker 2: There were certain--now my wife is from the area on the west end of Alexandria called Seminary, and Seminary has--they had the same situation there, outdoor toilets.
Speaker 1: All right, so, were the streets paved in Sunnyside?
Speaker 2: Originally, no.  They had just gravel on them.  And we didn't have a hard asphalt surface until I was in high school, that too came after the war.  And one reason was that street became a little bit of a thoroughfare for the area of Alexandria [Virginia] known as Beverly Hills.  It was the short cut that people took getting into Washington, from the Beverly Hills area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was Beverly Hills kind of an analogous to the Beverly Hills in California?
Speaker 2: No, not really, it was--in comparison to where we lived it was, but it was brick homes, all white, but brick homes and one of the better new neighborhoods in the Alexandria area.  As a kid I would go--whenever it would snow, I'd take my shovel and go knock on doors and pick up 20 to 30 bucks shoveling snow there.  Plus Beverly Hills had a lovely hill called overlook drive that we would sleigh ride down on snow days as a kid, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So you grew up in Sunnyside?
Speaker 2: I grew up in Sunnyside.  Well, now we didn't have--we didn't have any schools there.  We had to pass two schools on the way to go into Alexandria to go to the old black high school, which was a high school and elementary school called Parker-Gray High School.
Story_ID: 34179
Speaker 1: Do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I have four siblings, and my two older brothers, the oldest one is Dr. Houston George Brooks, Jr.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is he a physician?
Speaker 2: No. He's a--he was a research chemist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he graduated from Parker-Gray High School and then graduated from Storer College.  He and my second brother Henry Curtis Brooks, Jr. graduated from Storer College. The oldest boy went to Tuskegee Institute in those days to get a master's degree in chemistry.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is Dr. Houston Brooks?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you name your siblings in order?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Houston George Brooks, Jr.
Speaker 1: Okay, he's the oldest?
Speaker 2: Then there's Henry Curtis Brooks, then there's Nellie Victoria Brooks Quander, that's spelled    Q-U-A-N-D-E-R, and then of course Leo Austin Brooks and then Francis Keith Brooks, my baby brother who's eleven years younger than I, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were telling us that Houston George Brooks is a chemist, a research chemist?
Speaker 2: Yes.  After graduating from Tuskegee--by the way he's now being deferred from service because we--we've gotten through World War II.  He would have been eligible at the end of World War II, there was a draft still going on.  He was deferred because he was a chemistry student.  From there he went to Iowa State University to work on a doctorate.  He got about half way through his work and of course when you do doctoral work in chemistry, the greatest portion of your work is your research project.  Well, he came upon coming close to his twenty-ninth birthday, so his draft board which was still here in Alexandria, called for him.  So he went into the service and had to delay his work for those two years he was in the service.  He came back out and went back to Iowa State, finished, and then went to work as a research chemist for American Cyanamid Corporation in New Jersey, in New Brunswick, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then passed away a year ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, and Henry Curtis Brooks?
Speaker 2: Henry Curtis Brooks, well he finished Storer College, went to Andover Newton Theological Seminary in Newton Center, Massachusetts, which is a suburb of Boston where he earned a Bachelor of Divinity Degree.  And in those days you also had what was called the Master of Sacred Theology, the STM Degree.
Speaker 1: Now, is he a reverend?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And ordained by my father, by the way.
Speaker 1: So he's Baptist--
Speaker 2: Trained, initially, by my father but ordained up in Massachusetts.  He then went to Boston University to get a doctorate.  It was during the days that Oral Roberts was very popular on TV for telling people to put your hand on the television and be healed.  Well, there were no scholarly people who could speak to that.  So he and two other persons were encouraged to do dual work.  His doctorate is in psychology from Boston University, but he completed almost all of the courses for a medical degree at the same time so that he would have the dual knowledge to be able to speak to the healing situation.  And then he taught and became the dean of Clinical Pastoral Studies at Andover Theological Seminary in Boston, he was there for almost twenty five years.  And he has subsequently passed.
Story_ID: 34180
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's Reverend Henry Curtis Brooks?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Reverend Doctor Henry Curtis Brooks.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Dr. Henry Curtis--
Speaker 2: Ph.D. from Boston University.
Speaker 1: --Okay.  Now these--
Speaker 2: By the way he was there at the same time that Martin Luther King was there.
Speaker 1: --Yeah.  I was going to ask you about that.  And also are these the only two that attended Storer?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: I know Storer College is closed, I guess in the "60s" (1960s)?
Speaker 2: About, maybe 10 years after that they closed it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Dr. Richard McKinney who I think was the last president?
Speaker 2: Richard McKinney was the president when they were students there.  When McKinney left Storer, incidentally, he came to Virginia State College for a one-year term as the Dean of the Chapel while the then dean was away finishing his doctorate.  And of course I was a student there when Dr. McKinney was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay, so Nellie Brooks Quander?
Speaker 2: Nellie Brooks Quander is a graduate of--after leaving Alexandria, she was a graduate of Virginia Union University, and she holds a master's degree from George Washington University and, incidentally, she received her master's degree the same night I did at George Washington University.  So my parents got to see two at once.  And then of course she has a what they now call a education certificate which is thirty hours above a master's degree.  She taught in--went back to Alexandria to teach.   Rose through the ranks, became a principal and was the first African American principal--was the first principal, I guess it is, of the combined schools.  When they integrated the schools, they closed what had become Charles Houston.  The old Parker-Gray's name was changed to Charles Houston, and she became the principal when it was combined with what--the white children went to what was called Jefferson Elementary School.  So she became the principal of that school.  After several years Fairfax County was attempting to increase its minority faculty population and participation, and she was recruited to come into Fairfax County where she was the principal of Hybla Valley Elementary School, which is about five miles north of where we are right now on U.S. 1.  And from there she grew to be the director of curriculum--elementary school curriculum for Fairfax County, and she finished her career as--in teaching, as the area administrator.  Fairfax County is broken into four areas, it's such a large county, and so she was the area administrator for Area Four for the county which is this part of--the southern part of Fairfax County.  During her time there, in the education business--system, she rose to be elected the president of the National Elementary School Principal's Association, became the first African American to finally get to that.  See she started in the segregated system, and then after 1954, the Supreme Court decision, and they began to break up the segregated system in Alexandria, you know, she went through that transition.
Story_ID: 34181
Speaker 1: The old Parker-Gray school--in 1948, thereabouts, when it became apparent that the case of Brown vs. the Board of Education might not be sustained in the appellate court, the appellate court decision might not be sustained, the school systems decided to upgrade black schools, and the reason was, was the old Percy Ferguson decision said that segregation is all right as long as the school systems are equal.  Well, they were obviously unequal, because the school that I went to we didn't have a cafeteria, we didn't have a gym, the gym was about the size of a half of a basketball court.  It was also the state--the auditorium, and the ceiling was about 12 to 14 feet high, so you couldn't play basketball, couldn't do anything else hardly in it.  And thank God the U.S. Government had placed a USO [United Service Organizations] in the city that we could then use for a basketball court and for other large activities, we didn't have it.  The chemistry lab was almost nothing, the biology lab was about six microscopes and that was the extent of biology and of course that's the school we came up through.  And the books that we got were the used books from the white schools, off times with no backs, with pages torn out, things of that nature.  But God is great and we survived even that.  So they built a new Parker-Gray High School about six blocks away and converted the old one into just an elementary school and then they finally did away with it.  I got off the track there.  In an effort to meet the demands of Plessy v. Ferguson, they built a new high school.  There's Luther Jackson High School in Merrifield which is part of Fairfax County which was also an attempt to comply.  But of course the May, 1954 decision said for greater reasons than the building, the school systems are unequal, highly psychologically and sociologically they're unequal.  So, that's-then brought integration here in the Alexandria area.
Speaker 2: Now the new school that was built to replace Parker-Gray was named after Charles Hamilton Houston, you said?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Were you saying that?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The old Parker-Gray--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Was replaced.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And one of those pictures over there has me standing on the opening night of that building, standing out front of the replacement school.  When integration then came about, they tore it down too and integrated that-- Parker-Gray's student body and George Washington High School's student body into Hammond High School.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And subsequently came T.C. Williams High School which replaced both of them as the senior high school.  And Hammond and George Washington became middle schools, or not middle, I guess you'd call them junior high schools.
Story_ID: 34182
Speaker 1: Okay.  So became Hammond then combined with another school to become T.C. Williams.  All right.  Now, what about Leo Austin Brooks, oh, that's you.  All right, now Francis Brooks?
Speaker 2: Want to go to Francis first?
Speaker 1: So you're next to--
Speaker 2: I'm number four.
Speaker 1: This interview will take care of your story, but your younger brother, Francis?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my youngest brother of course is eleven years younger than I am, and we jokingly refer to him as a mistake and an accident.  Went to--he was in next to the last class in the old Parker-Gray High School.  After graduating from there, he went to live with my brother in Boston, and he attended Browne and Nichols Academy which is a pretty exclusive prep school in Cambridge, across the river in Cambridge.  He went for two years there.  And while there was encouraged by a member of the faculty to apply to go to Norwich University in Vermont.  He was also enamored by the fact that at that point, I was already a captain in the army and it was a military school so that everything meshed in his desires and he went to Norwich University.  During his junior year, or at the end of his sophomore year, he had to take a physical to go to ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] summer camp, or to go into the advanced ROTC program.  They discovered he had high blood pressure, and he was told you go home this summer and get it down and then maybe you will be able to come into the advanced program.  Well, it turned out to be a case of unarrestable high blood pressure, so he couldn't go in, so he switched his straight chemistry degree to an education degree.  He went up to the town of Montpelier [Vermont] to do his cadet teaching during his senior year, and he lived with the sheriff and his wife.  He was the only black person in the city of Montpelier.  But the sheriff and his wife fell so in love with him and the school system did too, when he graduated they begged him to come back to work there.  So he went back to Montpelier and was hired as a science teacher in the high school, progressed through the system to become the head of the science department.  In the meanwhile, during the meantime, he got his master's degree from Bates University across the--not Bates, New York University just across the river into New York, I can't recall at this moment the name of the school.  And also became a volunteer fireman.  Got to know a lot of people and someone said you ought to run for the State Legislature.  So he ran for the House of Delegates and won.  He knocked off a republican who had been there for about twenty years, and remained in the State Legislature for 26 years, rising to be Chairman of the State House Appropriations Committee, the delegates, it's not a house, it's a House of Delegates Appropriation Committee and another committee.  He retired from the school system, gave up his seat and ran for what is called the Sergeant-at-Arms of the State Capitol, and he's elected by the State Legislature, and he is today, still, the Sergeant-at-Arms of the State Capitol of Vermont.  Now they don't have a Sergeant-at-Arms of the Senate and the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House, things of that nature, it's not that big.  So the Sergeant-at-Arms is over the building that the governor is in as well as both houses of the legislature.  He's there yet today.
Story_ID: 34183
Speaker 1: That's quite a story.  Now these are all pretty good success stories.  Your family did well.
Speaker 2: Thank you, thank you.
Speaker 1: I take it the atmosphere in your household was one that promoted education when you were growing up in Sunnyside?
Speaker 2: It goes all the way back to that great-grandfather, Richard Henry Brooks, who was--as you read through his autobiography, was a rather aggressive kind of person.  My grandfather [Henry Curtis Brooks] was equally an aggressive man, and from the time I was old enough to understand conversation, I heard all of my life, if you are willing to work, you can be what you want to be.  Nobody is smarter than you, some work harder than others and if you are the harder worker, you will advance.  Education is your key out of segregation.  Education is the way that you will be able to demand respect of all men.  That was the nature of the way I was raised.  I don't know when I wasn't going to college.  In other words, I never expected that I wouldn't.  It's just like you expect to go from the fourth grade to the fifth or from the--into high school from elementary school.  I just thought that the next path was on to college, and that was the way we were raised, always to be aggressive and always seek to demand respect, though on many occasions you were not respected, you still sought to be respected.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, we always ask this question.  Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Do I have an earliest childhood memory?  I guess I really don't.  You know, I got some early memories, but I can't--I can't say you know what was the earliest.  I can remember things from when I was four or five years old, but very little prior to that.  I can remember my great-grandmother, Mary Frances Brooks, her, I can remember her funeral when I was four and we were in the--the children were in the balcony of the church, I can remember that.  I don't remember very much else that I can kind of pinpoint as a benchmark.
Story_ID: 34184
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, we ask this question too, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in Sunnyside?
Speaker 2: What was what?
Speaker 1: Some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Of my early life?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, when that man came around each week on Mondays to clean out the toilet, that's something you'll never forget. (laughing)  I remember as a kid a boy coming down the street on a bicycle, hollering "Extra, extra, read all about it," and he had a newspaper he was selling and it was telling us about Pearl Harbor.  Of course, at the time I was already eight-years old.  We had to--when my father [Houston George Brooks, Sr.] couldn't take us to school, we had to ride the bus.  And if we would walk about 12 or 14 blocks, we could ride the bus for a nickel.  If we caught the bus nearer to home, it was ten cents, and then we would ride right past, and by the way, when we walked that 12 to 14 blocks, we would be walking right past another elementary school that we could not attend.  And I will always remember the jolliness of those kids going to that school right there that I couldn't go to, and it hurt me even till today.  I was a musician.  My grandfather [Henry Curtis Brooks] was a trombone player and a baritone horn player.  And when I say grandfather, I'm talking about my father's father, and he taught my two older brothers to play the trombone and the baritone.  My parents paid twenty-five cents a lesson for my sister to take piano lessons, and by the time it got to me, I started trombone lessons, had about three lessons and then that was the end of that, but I finished teaching myself how to play the trombone and used music as a vehicle for a significant portion of my early life.
Speaker 1: Used the vehicle for--
Speaker 2: Well, I played well enough in high school that I was able to secure a scholarship to go to college if I would be a music education major, so I was an instrumental music education major in college.  In those days college costs $590 a year, and I got $300 from the scholarship.  Now, my father would be--we would--all of us would work all summer, all of the boys and my father and grandfather would work.  And we wouldn't get a salary, the boys, we didn't get a salary.  If we needed a dollar for a date or what not, we could get that, but we didn't get any more money.  And he would save that up, and come September, he would pay tuitions for my sister and the older boys and subsequently me.  When--by March or so that money would run out, and he would borrow money to pay it, and he had a lawyer, a white lawyer in Alexandria [Virginia] that he would borrow, and I had the pass book that he would borrow five hundred, eight hundred dollars or thereabouts and pay him back at fifty dollars a month until summertime, and then we would have the whole crew working, he'd pay that off and store up some more for us to go to school in the fall.
Story_ID: 34185
Speaker 1: Okay, so music was a big part of growing up and playing the Trombone?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I played trombone throughout high school, traveling with the Elks Band, Elks Lodge Number 85 in Washington, D.C.  We'd coast to New York--to Buffalo to Chicago [Illinois] to Cincinnati [Ohio] and other places and--which developed me to extent that I qualified for a scholarship to go to Virginia State College, which was worth $300 a year, which was half of what it took in those days.
Speaker 1: I want to go back.  Something else I have on the outline, it was really important, too.  The boy scouts?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell us about the boy scouts?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We had a troupe in Alexandria [Virginia] called 575, Troupe 575. It was the black troupe in Alexandria.  My two older brothers had been in when it started.  I was subsequently a cub scout in it and then was a scout.  I rose to explorer scout, which is--which is not in the regular channel of scouting and had some wonderful experiences that also helped teach me some leadership skills.  And then of course when I went off to college, I became an assistant scout master for the scout troupe there at Virginia State College for the young--for the faculty members' kids mostly.
Story_ID: 34186
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us about school.  Did you start at Parker High--
Speaker 2: Parker-Gray?
Speaker 1: --Yeah, was it an elementary school, different--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was both an elementary school and a high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the way they generally worked it was, you went to--they had a second elementary school, which by the way, my grandfather, Henry Curtis Brooks, was the agitator who stimulated the city into giving it--giving an old factory down on Pitt Street, you know, to converting it to a school.  So you went to Parker-Gray Elementary School, which was in the same building with the high school.  The first floor was elementary, the second floor was high school, and the basement was high school.  You went to the first through the fifth grade, through the fourth grade rather, at Parker-Gray, and then you went out to Lyles-Crouch and then from Lyles-Crouch you came back in the seventh grade back to Parker-Gray.
Speaker 1: So Lyles-Crouch would be middle school?
Speaker 2: It was an elementary school also.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It went from the first through the sixth grade.  And then you went--in those days we only had eleven years of school.  You started high school in the eighth grade, didn't have a middle school, no such thing as a middle school for us.  So you're right there in the same building you went to the seventh grade in Parker-Gray and then you went right on into high school, right there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you had to go to the sixth grade at Lyles-Crouch?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Fifth and sixth grade you went to Lyles-Crouch.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that name?
Speaker 2: L-Y-L-E-S, C-R-O-U-C-H, and it's with a dash in between, it's two people, just as is Parker-Gray, two people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, who was Parker-Gray named for, were they black people?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  The--one had been the principal at Snowden School and the other one had been the principal at Hollowell(sp) School, those were the two schools that we could attend before there was a high school, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So I take it you liked school, did you?
Speaker 2: Well, I was the fourth child in as I say a very aggressive family and when I got to school, all I would hear--everybody knew almost everybody, knew the families anyway, and my father had gone to school with at least two of the teachers as a kid.  Everybody expected me to be like my brothers--two older brothers and sisters.  Well, I rebelled, you know.  I now look back on it and see that I was looking for a piece of attention in that bunch of fast burners too, and I kind of acted out a little bit.  So when I got to the eighth grade--well, let us back up a minute.  One of the stunts I did, I used to bring--because I lived out--it was rural in those days out where I lived.  I used to keep the class supplied with frogs and snakes and things of that nature.
Story_ID: 34187
Speaker 1: Now this is 1938 or so when you started school.  You started school in '38' (1938)?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.  So I used to keep the class, you know, supplied with things of that nature.  And I had a teacher who does--the post office in Alexandria is named after--her name was Helen Day who when you did your multiplication tables or what not, you stood before her and she sat in a chair, and she had these flash cards, and she would raise the flash card up, and you would have to say nine times five is forty-five, eight times eight is sixty-four, whatever came up.  If you got it right she'd put it in one pile and if you got it wrong, she'd put it in another pile.  At the end of the pile, she would count the wrongs, and she had a strap about an inch and a half wide, and you held out your hand and for everyone you missed, you got a real slam right into the palm of your hand with that strap.  So it was--you were incentivized to learn your multiplication tables.  Well, one day I missed several.  And so at the end of the day, she was out of the room, I packed up the tadpoles that I had taken to school, put them back in the bottle and had them at my desk.  Well, when she walked in the room, one of the little girls says, oh, Miss Day, he's taking the tadpoles home.  So she and I fell out.  Well, we fell back in later, because she and my dad had knew each other very well.  But I was bent on being, as I said earlier, respected, but I didn't quite know how off times to do it.  When I got to high school, the first semester, I got my report card back, and of course we had show and tell at my house, you walked in with the report card and you stood at attention, as it were, while my parents reviewed the report card and you were praised or hazed right there.  Well, I brought this report card home from the first semester in high school.  And now I had been already working with my father, so I was mechanically oriented anyway, but I had a "B" in shop a "C" in English, I had another "B", I don't know, history or something, but all the rest "Cs".  Well, my father and mother sat me down this time.  By then my two older brothers had gone off to college and my sister was not at home at the time, so it was just my mother and father and I.  And my father said, "Son, this is ridiculous, it cannot happen again.  Here's what we're going to do."  Now, I'm looking over at my mother who's sitting there with tears in her eyes, because they obviously have already discussed this strategy before they called me in.  He said "You're going to come home from school every day, go into your room and study until suppertime.  When supper is over you will do the dishes, when it's your turn and then you will study until eight o'clock and then you will go to bed, you won't go out and play.  On Saturdays you'll be able to go out and play from 10 to 12, at 12 you come in and you begin to study until six.  Sunday after church you will study.  And you will do this for the next semester.  Now you don't have to do it--now he's very stern at this moment," his voice is raising a bit, I recall it as if it were yesterday.  "You don't have to do it, you can quit school, get out and get a job and pay your mother thirty dollars a month to live here and feed you or you can get out of the house."  Now, the tears are really running down my mother's face and I'm as afraid as Goldie Locks before the big bad wolf. (laughing)  So I took the first alternative and went from a bungling average to an "A" student.
Speaker 1: How old are you at this point?
Speaker 2: Well, I was about 14 years old, 13, 14 years old, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 34188
Speaker 1: So there's a real possibility you could be put out?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  I thought he meant it.  It was no doubt in my mind that he meant it.  But I guess he also, being a man over the years I refer to as one of the greatest practical psychologists I have ever known, he probably knew also that I would crumple under that pressure and get down to work.  And as you saw on the picture I showed you earlier, you know, I graduated with honors.  And becoming a class president for three of the four years, and the fourth year I was president of student council, was always active in things of that nature.  And while all this was going on I was singing in the school chorus, as well as the adult choir at Alpha Street Baptist in Alexandria [Virginia] from the time I was about fifteen years old.  And while in that choir, incidentally, we had some augmentation of some people who came to help us sing the Messiah one Christmas, and along in that group was a man by the name of Othella Wilson, who was the director of a semi-professional group called the Musical Arts Choir of Washington, D.C.  And Othella Wilson invited me to come to a rehearsal and try out for the Musical Arts Choir.  Now here I am again, a seventeen year old boy by this time, and I ended up singing and making two tours with them.  They didn't take long tours, they took three to four day trips, and sang with them at several colleges and two church performances, and got a wonderful musical experience, you know, out of that.  But back at the high school, once I caught the spirit that--in myself that I could be seen positively as opposed to acting out, I begin to enjoy, really enjoy high school, yeah.  We had an Elks oratorical contest while I was there.  And my sister having won the city--the state and becoming a national oratorical contest contestant before me.  When I came along I won the city as well as coming in second in the State of Virginia.  I don't know where I found time to do all that, but I did.  And then off to Virginia State College.
Story_ID: 34189
Speaker 1: Now, before we leave high school, tell us who were some of your mentors in high school, were there any special teachers?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.  My homeroom teacher's name was Farris Holland.  He was also the chemistry teacher.  He had been the inspiration for my oldest brother and my baby brother to enter chemistry, was quite a mentor.  The principal, whom as a kid, most kids didn't like, because he was tough.  His name was William H. Pitts.  And--but as I grew older, I learned from my own experiences that he had been one of the best mentors I had ever had.  And then the music teacher there, his name was Patterson, Earl Patterson, was also a great mentor of mine, and he's the one who kind of pushed me further and further in music.
Speaker 1: Was he the bridge to the music scholarship?
Speaker 2: Well, he's the one who told me about it, yeah, yeah, you know, that it was available, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He's an important man.  Now, did you play any sports in high school at all?
Speaker 2: I ran track one year.  Ran about a six and a half minute mile and that was enough.  One of the problems we had was we lived out--didn't have school buses so that if you played on the football team, you'd get home seven o'clock or eight o'clock at night, having to ride the bus home and what not, so it wasn't really convenient for me and so I didn't spend much time doing that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, college, now you graduate from high school in--
Speaker 2: 1950.
Speaker 1: --Okay.  So you go on to Virginia State.  This is near Petersburg, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, what was--who were some of the special people at Virginia State?
Speaker 2: Well, the head of my department's name was Nathaniel Gatlin, G-A-T-L-I-N is the way he spells his last name.
Speaker 1: That's the music department, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Dr. Nathaniel Gatlin is head of the department.  He's also the orchestra and band director.  And he was like a father to me.  There was another man there who ran the laundry and some other business enterprises for the school.  See they had a laundry because they did the boys'--the males' clothes for them and they provided assistance to the females.  And he ran that laundry.  He'd graduated from Morehouse College and was a member of my fraternity, Alpha Phi Alpha.  And he was also the advisor for the fraternity.  He was more like a father to me.  They were quite instrumental in pushing me.  Both of them--I couldn't do poorly with the kind of inspiration that they gave to me, you know.  They just pushed me to run harder.
Speaker 1: What was the man's name who ran the laundry?
Speaker 2: John B. Saunders, S-A-U-N-D-E-R-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He'd been a great football player at Morehouse.  And then there were several other people who had positive influence on me there.  One was the business manager, his name is John Cephas.
Speaker 1: C-E-P-H-A-S?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34190
Speaker 1: And he was quite a, you know, quite an inspiration to me too.  I don't know whether those people were doing that at that point just as a matter of a way to get a kid to work or how sincere they were, but it sure worked on me, you know, it caused me to work very hard at things to the extent that I became the president of my fraternity at the end of my sophomore year which normally doesn't happen.  That's normally at the end of your junior year.  So I was the president of my fraternity for two years.
Speaker 2: How did you come--were your brothers in A Phi A?
Speaker 1: My oldest brother was an Omega and was infuriated.  And of course Alexandria was basically--it wasn't that many in those days, but there were more Kappas than anything else.  But when I went there I met and was so impressed by the then president of the student government and two or three other, what I called big guys on campus, campus leaders were Alphas, and I kind of fell in with them.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And ended up the president of student government of Virginia State University.  Not to brag but I was also the student conductor of the concert band, the director of the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] band, the regimental adjutant of the ROTC and they called me in to say we would make you the commander, but you have too much else going on in school, so we're going to let somebody else do that, (laughing) which was fine with me.  So I was thoroughly involved the whole time I was in school.  And things that gave me exposure to the president, Dr. R. P. Daniel, Richard Prentiss Daniel was his name, I mean Robert Prentiss Daniel, rather, who was very kind to me and heard several of my cries about things on the campus.  I was able to get some things done, that had I gone boisterous about them, I'd probably would have never gotten them done, not in 1953 or '54' (1954).
Story_ID: 34191
Speaker 1: Now in those days just tell us a little bit about what campus life was like, because it's different, way different from today?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes.  We ate family style.  You had tablemates that you ate dinner and supper with, breakfast you ate--as you came in they would make up tables.  Now, of course, I would always try to find a table with girls and--because the girls didn't each much and I would be able to get a little bit more breakfast.  In addition to that when I went we still had World War II barracks that augmented the male dormitories.  And I lived in the barracks my freshman year where it was cold all of the time.  It was against the rules to have a heater but I had one and I would hide it up behind my clothes in my closet.  I had a little shelf I made right behind my clothes in the closet about half way up, and I would sit it on that and so that--when I'd have it down trying to keep the temperature up above--the temperature was about 60 degrees in there, to keep it warm in there and it would blow out the fuse, I would immediately take it and put it up underneath my clothes, because the building monitor--the dorm monitor would come around looking for whose blowing the fuses out.  And the other trick was you'd have to open your window right away so it would cool down, because if you came in there and it was warm, he'd know you had a heater in there some place.
Speaker 1: You mean the building was not heated?
Speaker 2: Well it was heated but I was the last room on the end and it was an old coal furnace--coal fire furnace with the hot air blown in and it wasn't very effective at all and the building leaked like a sieve anyway.  But then of course after that I moved into the brick dormitories up closer on campus.  We had four fraternities there and each fraternity--we didn't have fraternity houses, we had a fraternity room and they were all in the basement of Trinkle Hall, and the girls had to be in by six o'clock.  If they were out after six o'clock, they were on a pass.  They were either in class or going to and from something.  But you couldn't lollygag around the campus.
Speaker 1: This is only for the girls?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in those buildings, yeah.  We could come--boys could be out.  You could go down to visit them.  You could only go into the sitting parlor or in the lobby of the building to sit with the girl.  And you had to be out of there before eight o'clock.  Another young fellow and I, who subsequently became a lawyer, used to go down to one of the girl's dormitory to play cards at night every now and then, and you could stay until eight.  But I met my--I knew my wife [Naomi Lewis Brooks] from high school days, and my family knew her family.  And it wasn't until we got off into college that we began to date.  I was a year ahead of her and of course you had to finish your date by eight o'clock and then you could only be in the library with her or in a program or something in the auditorium or what not, otherwise you had to be in the sitting parlor.  The faculty in those days with a few exceptions did more to teach life than they did to teach chemistry and music and history and things of that nature.  They were people who were dedicated to molding youngsters.  And that doesn't exist very much anymore, and I'd been on several campuses with my children and with my grandchildren and it's just not like it used to be in that respect.  That's one way in which, as far as I'm concerned, integration has not served us because you didn't have those additional support systems--you don't have those additional support systems that you had in those days.
Story_ID: 34192
Speaker 1: Are we back on the air now?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I want to ask you about the military history of Petersburg.  I mean it's a historic place in terms of black soldiers and their service in the civil war.  I was just wondering if that was taught to you or not.  You were in the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps], right--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: --At Virginia State?
Speaker 1: Yes.  The significance of the crater battle to me was something that we generally don't stop to remember that even soldiers in those days had to stop and rest.  They didn't have any facilities we have now, and it made no difference which side they were on, the use of defensive lines was--was quite common, and you would layer your defense in echelons.  Well, of course, the Battle of the Crater, the union from the southeast side along that ridge dug that tunnel which took several months to dig.  The union army is sitting there now--the confederate army is sitting still along this defensive line.
Speaker 2: Tell us now whose idea--this was the idea of [General Ambrose E.] Burnside, right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: General Burnside.  And who dug the tunnel?
Speaker 1: Well, union infantry dug that tunnel, and I guess they expected that the confederates would stay right there long enough for them to get it dug.  And of course, if you look at the drawings of it now, they had to build--they had to dig holes that came straight up to the surface along the way and build a fire over the hole so that it would suck air into the tunnel and the people digging wouldn't suffocate in there.  It was quite an engineering feat, it turned out to be.  And of course, once it was blown, it destroyed the line and before they realized they might have done better had they stayed, the confederate army moved back--back up the Appomattox River until it got up to the Appomattox Courthouse and of course that's where the surrender finally took place, yeah.  I used to teach military history and we used the battle of--that battle at Petersburg as an example of how the absence of mobility can become a detriment to your--to your unit because we teach the principles of war, you know, maneuver, mobility, objective, you know, security and surprise, etc.  And of course, we used the Battle of Princeton as an example of mobility at night and several others that we used to teach how even in those days, we used the principles of war.  Now we go all the way back to the revolution, and when the Union Army--when [General George Washington] was just about done, they were just about wiped out, and had retreated to just up above Philadelphia, the name of the town escapes me now, it will come to me in just a minute.
Speaker 2: Trenton [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: No, no.  Just up the Schuylkill River.  There's a college there now.  I spoke at the college.  I can't even think of it now.  It'll come to me in just a moment.  When you retreated there, that's when we had the gift of aide from France which brought in [Friedrich von] Steuben, [Tadeusz] Kosciuszko and [Marquis de] Lafayette and a couple others who took parts of the union army--of the revolutionary army and--[Casimir] Pulaski was another--and massaged it. Von Steuben became the Kremlin of the IG [Inspector General] and taught us, you know, how to inspect the unit and how to train it and what not.  Others taught tactics and things of that nature and led units during the revolution when they then got back on their feet.  But before we leave here, it's going to come back to me as well as I know that--Valley Forge.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 34193
Speaker 1: So, in terms of ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] now, was that like--did you envision yourself going into the military for a long period of time when you were taking ROTC?
Speaker 2: I tried to get out--I'll be honest with you, I tried to get out of ROTC.  I said I have bad sinus problems when I was a freshman, and I'd like to get exempted.  Well the smart sergeant said, well, all right, sir, you can get out of it, but we notify your draft board tomorrow.  So I decided maybe I better suffer my sinus and take ROTC.  So I did well.  As a sophomore you become a sergeant, and I became a master sergeant as a sophomore and most guys--just a few people get that.  Then in my junior year, I became a captain and most juniors don't get passed first lieutenant, you know, few will get to be captain, and cause my senior year, I became a lieutenant colonel in ROTC.  Before you go off to your summer camp between your junior and senior year, the ROTC faculty picks students who have potential, and they call them distinguished military students.  And you go to camp, and you get a extra observation, you get extra jobs, leadership jobs, because you're being evaluated.  Well, you don't know that when it's happening and that was going on with me.  So when I came back, I was given the job as regimental adjutant, which is the--you have the regimental commander, the executive officer and the adjutant.  In the spring of my senior year, they called me in and said we're going to nominate you for a regular army commission which meant thirty years.  Well, I had taken that scholarship money, plus I wanted to teach music in the school system, public school system.  I was already being courted by Alexandria [Virginia] to come back to Alexandria to teach, to take over Paterson's, Earl Patterson's work.  So I turned it down, turned the regular army commission down, which was about as offensive a move as I could have ever made to the professor of military science and tactics.  So I didn't take the regular army commission.  I graduated, got the band master's award and all sorts of other things, got the quarter master gold key, all sorts of awards, and went on into the army.
Story_ID: 34194
Speaker 1: When I--the first unit I was in, I was in what was called headquarters and headquarters company of Fort Lee.
Speaker 2: So you went into the army going as a--
Speaker 1: Second Lieutenant.
Speaker 2: --Second Lieutenant, okay.
Speaker 1: For Fort Lee.  All of the black officers coming out of the--once you go in, you go to school, go to the basic officer's course.  Most all of the black officers were going to the two troupe units, the third quarter master group, and the, what is it, the five 39th, or five 49th quarter master group, because that's where most of the black soldiers were on the post.
Speaker 2: Now this is 1954?
Speaker 1: This is now January, 1955.
Speaker 2: Fifty-five (1955), okay.
Speaker 1: I was sent to headquarters in headquarters' company.  And to my knowledge no one knew of a black officer having been in headquarters' company.  There was one other black officer in the special troops command, and he was the company commander of the casual company, that's whereas troops come into the post, that's where you report in.  His name was Jack Halsey, who just passed here about three years ago.  But I was in headquarters cause it was second lieutenant.  The company commander changed after I was there about a month.  And a man by the name of James G. Monteith, M-O-N-T-E-I-T-H, became the company commander.  He was a white man who was born in Arizona but raised in New York City, who did not have a college degree, knew that I did, and used me to help him off-times with some of his college work, but who also took me under his wing.  He had been in the army during World War II.  When World War II was over in 1946, he was released as a First Lieutenant along with thousands of other officers.  In December, 1950, after the Korean War broke out, he and some 25 or 30,000 other people were called back to duty.  Now he was called in on December the 30th, 1950, I'll always remember it.  So, that made him much older than me, but he took time to say to me things like what kind of sports do you play?  And I would say, well, I can play a little softball and basketball.  He said, can you play tennis, no, says, do you have golf clubs, no, do you bowl, I says no.  He said, well you got to go do that.  He says why don't you do that?  I says where I came from, I wasn't allowed on a tennis court.  If I was at the bowling alley, all I could do was set pins.  So he said I want you to go to the thrift shop and buy a set of used golf clubs, and I'm going to teach you how to play golf.  He did several things like that.  He said you need to get into the extension--officer's extension education program.  You've already finished the basic course, but you need to start on the middle level course right now.   He says because when boards look at your records, they say, oh, this officer has been studying, he's been trying to improve himself even over what he has to do, says you need to get into the quarter master general's reading program.  He did several things like that, encouraged me to do those.  And all the time he was laying the groundwork to encourage me then to apply to go into the regular army, which I had once refused.  And after about fifteen months working with him, I applied.  In fact, it got to the point where I signed his name and he could not tell whether he wrote it or I wrote it.  And he was--would be sitting there at his desk working on his school work, trying to get out of college and I was doing much of his work.  I signed everything except the morning report, and that's the only document you go to jail if somebody signs it for you.  But all of the unit passes and what not, and so I got a great chance that he allowed me to run free in that unit.  And we had over 500 troops in our company.
Story_ID: 34195
Speaker 1: So you're basically in charge of 500 men?
Speaker 2: That's right as a second lieutenant.  And he is a benchmark along my route to whom today I'm dearly, you know, thankful for having known him.  And so I applied for the regular army and I was selected.  Of course the first question they asked before I went before the board, the selection board--
Speaker 1: Just a point of clarification.  Now you were in the reserve or something?
Speaker 2: --Well, you're a reserve officer meaning that your tenure is, you have no real tenure, you know, you can go whenever they don't need you any longer.  Many people stayed in the reserves through 20 years, but it's as if you were a temporary hire.  One of the disadvantages of that is if you're a regular army officer they know you're around so they can invest in you, they can invest education, they can invest quality jobs, things of that nature, so a regular army officers fair better than reserve officers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But where was I--I was--
Speaker 1: You decided to enlist into the regular army.
Speaker 2: --Oh, yeah, and one of the first questions before I--when I went before the board was why did you turn the army down the in the first place?  And I told them I hated it.  And they looked at me real strangely and I explained that I had been through ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].  I went to ROTC summer camp and the life of a cadet at summer camp was not what I was interested in spending the rest of my life doing.  And nobody took the time to explain to me that the life of an officer is very different from that of a cadet in summer camp.  And I guess I had punctured the pride of the ROTC faculty where--at Virginia State so bad that they didn't take time to correct that misunderstanding either.  Maybe I didn't offer it to them.  So I took the examination.  Also in those days you had to take a written examination, had to take two, a psychological battery and an educational battery.  What I did to prepare for both of those was I went over across the other side of Petersburg to Virginia State University and got the director of testing over there to give me a couple of tests so that I could practice on.  They were not the same test, but one was an educational test--educational achievement test, and the other was a psychological battery.  And I took them just to smooth out my skills of taking tests.  So I took those and passed those and by then I was in Alaska and was integrated into the regular army out there.
Story_ID: 34196
Speaker 1: Now a significant event occurred there.  Having started as a quartermaster, now having two and a half years of service, and integrating into the regular army, I was sent to the 23rd infantry regiment, it was there at the moment, still a regiment.  Well, they didn't know what to do with a quartermaster.  So they made me the public affairs officer.
Speaker 2: Now, where is this?
Speaker 1: This was in Fort Richardson, Alaska.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Fort Richardson.
Speaker 1: Made me the public affairs officer.  The inspector general discovered it, and said no, he has to be in a rifle company.  So I was then sent to a rifle company and by then it had been converted to a battle group from a regiment, and I was put in "B" company, 23rd infantry regiment.  There I am now competing.   I'm a first lieutenant competing with four other first lieutenants and a captain, all of whom had been to the infantry basic officers schools, all of whom had had experience in infantry units up to that time.  So the test was there before me.  And I survived it.  In fact, had two events that occurred while I was a lieutenant there.  They decided to train the--some recruits in Alaska instead of sending them back to the United States.  So they selected me and my platoon to take these 24 men, put them into squads in my platoon and teach them how to be soldiers--how to be infantry soldiers.  And we did it, and we did it very successfully, which turned out to be another milestone benchmark in my life.
Speaker 2: So this is what--what year is this?
Speaker 1: We're now in 1957, '58' (1958).
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: And then when those two years were up and I left the infantry, I went back to the same unit I had been in in Alaska, the Alaska General Depot.  You know when I went there, show you how God works.  I went to Alaska to be assigned as the Post Exchange officer up in the north, up at Eielson Air Force base up near Fairbanks.  But when I hit Fort Richardson they pulled me off of those orders, broke my heart, and put me in the 121st quartermasters' service company, which was about the lowest level of unit you can get.  My feelings were hurt.  I had been abused. What I had worked for had been taken away from me.  It turned out to be a blessing from God, because later on in my career and then too, I was with troops.  Had I been in the Post Exchange business, I would not have been with troops.  I would not have had that troop experience--some more troop experience.  When I went back to the depot after finishing my infantry two years, I became a company commander as a first lieutenant.  And there weren't very many first lieutenant commanders in those days.  All the rest of the commanders and depot were captains.  So there I was again getting a chance to stand out.  And it was a happenstance that was meant to be what I thought evil that turned out to be for good by having to go to the 121st quartermaster service company.  And that kind of experience happened to me several times in my life and each one of them turned out to be a blessing.  I went to Vietnam and we will probably get to that in a moment, but I went to Vietnam the first time, scheduled to go to headquarters U.S. Army Military Assistance group in Saigon.
Story_ID: 34197
Speaker 1: Now this is 19--
Speaker 2: Now we're all the way up to 1963, now.
Speaker 1: --Sixty-Three.  Okay so you--
Speaker 2: I've skipped over ROTC, my ROTC assignment.  I'll come back to that in just a minute.
Speaker 1: Okay, your first ROTC assignment.  That was at--
Speaker 2: That was at Central State College in those days.
Speaker 1: --Central State College--
Speaker 2: Let's go there and then I'll go to Vietnam in just a moment.
Speaker 1: --All right.
Speaker 2: I left and I came back to Central State College.
Speaker 1: So your sons were born in Alaska?
Speaker 2: Both boys were born in Alaska, one in the State--one in the territory, and of course that next year it became a state and the second one in the state.  The oldest boy Leo was born in the territory, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's before statehood for Alaska, right?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: That's when the United States had 49 states, 48 rather?
Speaker 2: And before the first boy was born, my wife [Naomi Lewis Brooks] taught in the adult education program there, because we had many soldiers who didn't have high school diplomas, and she taught in that program for a while.  And then after they were both born, she did it a couple of times.  She would get a babysitter just to keep her teaching skills honed, because she was the elementary school graduate--elementary education graduate also from Virginia State and taught in Alexandria for a year before I went to Alaska, yeah.  But on to ROTC, I worked for--before I got there I got a letter from this lieutenant colonel who said don't worry, you will not be hurt by coming to ROTC duty.  There was a reputation that these professors of military science were killing off young officers by giving them bad efficient reports, you know, that they really didn't deserve, give them poor reports.  He says don't worry about the efficient report, if you do well, you'll get well.  Well I got there to work for Roy W. Sorrell, who had graduated from Howard University in 1938 and who was the professor of military science.  And he took a liking to my work and I did well there, I taught military science--I taught map reading and military history for most of the time and substitute taught military law.  I was also the public affairs officer for the unit, and as always I got thoroughly involved in the community as did my wife.  My wife taught there on the campus also.  She taught remedial reading to college students, she ran their clinic.  And of course we had the two boys.  And we managed it by, I would teach my eight o'clock class, I lived about two minutes down the highway from the campus, I would dash home at 8:50, my wife would get in the car and dash up there, teach here nine o'clock class, when one of the kids was sick, and then she would come back at the end of her nine o'clock class, she would dash home at ten.  I would jump back in the car and dash back up and teach my ten o'clock class.  Whenever somebody would have the measles or something as kids always seemed to do.  But the kids went to laboratory school at two and three years old, got a wonderful head start.  And while there I had asked the army to send me to graduate school as they was doing many other people.  They said your degree is in music, we don't--you can't get accepted into a business school with a music degree.  So if you go prepare yourself, we'll consider it.  So while on the faculty I took courses.  I took 41 hours in the three years that I was there.  Made and "A" in every last class.  I wrote to the quartermaster branch, which I was back in, I said all right now send me to graduate school.  They says well you got to go to the advance course then after that we'll see.  Well, when the end of that came the see was the salt China Sea and I ended up in Vietnam.  When I got to Vietnam, I was on orders to go to MACV [Military Assistance Command, Vietnam] a US Army Military Assistance Group Vietnam, headquarters in Saigon.  Somehow or another somebody got a hold of my orders and I ended up way up country in a little place called Qui Nhon.
Story_ID: 34198
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't want to get away from Wilberforce [University] without asking you about Colonel Charles Young and B.O. Davis(sp) and some of the other history.  Were they talking about that in the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] program at Central?
Speaker 2: Very little, in those days, very little.  Although I knew of Charles Young's existence and influence there, because when Charles Young was around there, there was one school, it was Wilberforce University. Subsequently, the state and the separation of church and state deal separated its portion of the campus as Central State College.  Oddly enough there's a gully that looks like a canal that runs between the two schools as though it were a mote at one point.  But of course Wilberforce University had the great history of people.  In fact, it was Wilberforce University when the likes of Fred Sheffey who became a major general was out of there and several other people, yeah.
Speaker 1: Also Wilberforce being such an all black institution, Charles Wesley, who was the president of Central State when you were there, he was also the author of the history of the Alphas, right?
Speaker 2: Well, he's a history of several organizations.  He was also the historian of the boule of which I was also a member, he was the history if it and wrote out a rather significant volume on it as well as Alpha Phi Alpha, but Charles Wesley was, as far as I am concerned, was a tremendous lover of young people who caused many young people to achieve what they had no dream of ever doing, by being tolerant with their lack of money and also by his strictness on his faculty, yeah.  He has as his dean, Dean Jackson, who had been a Red Tail, the--
Speaker 1: Tuskegee--
Speaker 2: --Tuskegee Airman, yes, and who flew with them in Europe.
Speaker 1: --And you were saying, I think, off camera too that--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: --Off camera you mentioned that, before we got started that there was one of the original founders of A Phi A?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.  Henry A. Chapman lived in the community, and in fact, he came to a fraternity meeting while I was there as--and of course at the time he was about ninety-five years old, yeah. When was A Phi A founded?
Speaker 1: Nineteen o'eight (1908), December, 1908.  The oldest African American Fraternity at Cornell University, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I just wanted to make those points before we moved on, you know, because it's essential in such a historical place, in terms of Wilberforce the oldest black school, being just across the gully, as you say.
Story_ID: 34199
Speaker 1: But Vietnam, now, I remember as a kid the Kennedy administration, I guess, in a press conference, John Kennedy was saying that we had advisors in Vietnam.  So you went over as one of those advisors?
Speaker 2: That's right.  And I was stationed at Qui Nhon, and had--was the advisor to the (unclear) depot, that's the 121st Vietnamese Depot.  I had--was assigned an interpreter, and his job of course is to play in between you and the person whom you are the advisor to.  But I told him when I got there I said, your job is to teach me the language.  I expect in the next four months to be able to speak this language.  Well, by that time, I was--he had done a fairly good job, and I could carry on a reasonable conversation.  It came in very handy because quite often we would have meetings, joint meetings with all of our advisor group and with the command structure of the Vietnamese army there at Qui Nhon.  And at the end of it, when the Americans would get back together, my boss would say, well, my counterparts says it's such and such and such is what was really said and so and so and so and so.  Well, after about four months, I would say, sir, that's not what my boss, the Lieutenant Colonel, I said that's not what was said at all.  What was said was so and so, you know.  When he told it to you he had cleaned up the bad part and made it not so painful.  I said this is the situation.  Well, I then became quite a valuable resource because I could carry on a conversation.  I subsequently have lost most of it because that's been over 30 years--30 years now.  In fact that was about 40 years ago.
Speaker 1: Can you kind of tell people what was the situation in Vietnam.  Why was the United States in Vietnam?
Speaker 2: Well, this is my theory.  This is not what the, you know, what the government was saying.  McNamara was the secretary of defense.  I thought the whole time I was up there that we were pouring water down a rat hole.  We were attempting to impose a culture on people who at my level, were really not interested in our culture.  They were interested in their culture which was very different from ours.  There was a sergeant there, when McNamara came over, he asked this sergeant how are things going, and the sergeant said we're wasting time, you know, we need to go home.  Well, I understand the next day after McNamara left, the sergeant left, they sent him home.  But he was absolutely correct in my estimation.  And I turned out to be--it turned out to be true.  We wasted a lot of lives, a lot of money over a place that we could not gain control.  Their culture is just that much different from ours.  They had a coup--they had a president that we did not--that did not want us, but took our money and our soldiers in South Vietnam then they had a coup to get rid of that government, Ngo Dinh Diem government.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And things really didn't change that much.  And then I heard the president or the secretary of state [Henry A.] Kissinger say we have just signed a just and lasting peace.  Well the just and lasting peace lasted about six months and then I have the vision in my mind of the man hanging on the strut of a helicopter off of the top of the Embassy building as the last person out of the country, because we were gone, and it was all lost.  So as far as I am concerned, I was a soldier, I did exactly what I'm told to do and I always will, but that was a waste of our time and resources and our nation.
Story_ID: 34200
Speaker 1: Well, do you think it was inevitable that hostilities would escalate?  I know that the US was there officially as advisors in 1961 and so on?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, see then the North Vietnamese got involved and then the Chinese got involved and with those two sets of persons and resources, the Viet Cong was able to sustain.  See the Vietnamese people could not hold a village by themselves because there was so many, what I called sympathizers and what not in the villages that it was impossible to maintain security.  So the only thing you'd have would be the large cities and then you would lose--eventually lose those.  But the will of the people was not there to fight that war.  Those people had been fighting for years.  They fought the Chinese, you know, they fought on and on, they fought Communist and what not, and when the French left in 1954, you know, nothing changed.  Then we got in--and so those people were tired.  They'd had enough.  War is a way of life with them, and we were trying to finish a war and you couldn't do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's the gospel according to Leo. Okay.  All right, all right.  So, the first time you were there, you were there from '63' (1963) to--
Speaker 1: I went--I was due to go January the 23rd of 1963.  I said, you know, I'm going to try to go early, I'm not going to just sit around.  I had finished school, the officer's advance course in December.  I said I'm not going to sit around a month, I'm going to go--see if I can go.  So I got my date moved up to January the 4th.  Then that winter--the winter--matter of fact I had been there pretty much a year, the United States was trying to demonstrate that we were reducing our forces in Vietnam.  So they advanced the return of folks, so they says everybody whose ready to go--supposed to go home in January, we're going to send you home in December.  So I ended up only being over there 11 months and a few days.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you actually came back in '63' (1963).
Speaker 1: I came back in December, 1963.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  So that was your first tour, right?
Speaker 1: That was my first tour.  I've really enjoyed dealing with the people.  When we didn't have anything pressing, there was a group of us advisors who we would go out to Leprosarium(sp) which is just south of the town of Qui Nhon and we rebuilt their diesel generator and did other things to help them.  Learning to speak the language, I was able to go downtown and buy things that I really didn't want.  I'd go down and buy a chicken and what not just to practice their method of haggling and then I'd turn around and give the chicken to somebody on the street, you know.  But I just loved the people.  I got to see a good bit of the central highlands part of the country and the central coastland, where I was.  I learned to eat the food and learned to love it.
Story_ID: 34201
Speaker 1: But on returning home, I was put through another course, an advance logistics course, and then sent--and said, you promised me you were going to send me to graduate school it's my time, now.  So I got orders saying you're going to Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania.  The nearest graduate school was 80 miles away at Bucknell University.  So when I got the welcome letter from Indiantown Gap, I didn't respond to it.  I waited until I got home and I went to--because I got home early, I went over to the assignment office in Washington [D.C.] and said, what do you mean doing this to me?  You promised me you would send me to grad school.  I was not a fair-head boy in (unclear).  While they took care of a lot of people, they didn't take care of me, and I don't mind saying it.
Speaker 2: What was your rank at that point?
Speaker 1: At this point I'm a captain.  I was a captain.  So I went in and complained.  So they then changed my assignment to Fort Holabird, Maryland, where I ended up working for the intelligence community.  And my boss was most of the time down here in Washington, his headquarters was in Washington, so I was the expert, you know, working for them, and I worked for them for almost two and half years.  While doing that I also went to graduate school, on my own, and got a master's degree from George Washington University in financial management.
Speaker 2: Why financial management?
Speaker 1: Well, the undergraduate courses I took at Central State were all in the business arena.  You know I'd taken business law, accounting, business management, sales and marketing and all those things, Economics, etc., and so that's why I was enabled to qualify for George Washington University.  And as I said my daughter and I got our master's degrees the same night in 1966 at George Washington University.
Speaker 2: Your sister, right?
Speaker 1: My sister, yeah.
Story_ID: 34202
Speaker 1: Now during this period of time--well let me ask you a question about Vietnam in terms of--and the army.  What was the status of--how were black officers treated in Vietnam by the army and by the people, the Vietnamese people, how did they react to black officers?
Speaker 2: I didn't have any trouble.  You know, I heard a few stories, but for the most part, officers represented themselves very well, and as a result of it, we're well respected.
Speaker 1: By the Vietnamese?
Speaker 2: As advisors.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I knew several of them.  In fact I knew two who received great commendation for their work as advisors, first from the United States and then from the Vietnamese government, so that to me that was not a major roadblock.  There weren't many--well, there were several, there were about eight black officers at Qui Nhon.  They were all doing different kinds of advisory work than I was.  But I don't know if any of them who had any significant problem.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is also a time when 1963 the March on Washington took place and there was civil rights agitation all over the United States?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: North and South?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was in Vietnam for that and for the assignation of Kennedy.
Speaker 1: Now do you think, looking back on those times, do you think that the army was ahead of the--
Speaker 2: Did what?
Speaker 1: --When you look back on those days, do you think the army was ahead of the general population in terms of race relations?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was ahead then, and it stayed ahead, it's ahead today.  It outstripped the other services, it still does, and it has outstripped any segment of our society that you bring up.  I can show you how the army has done a much better job, not just in raising generals, but in raising non-commissioned officers and in providing opportunities for any proportional development, developing skills and what not, opportunities to be technicians of all types that pay much in civilian society.  They do much better than society does in general.
Speaker 1: Why do you think there's more opportunity for advancement or latitude in the army than in the general society?
Speaker 2: Then what?
Speaker 1: Why do you think there's more opportunity--
Speaker 2: In the army?
Speaker 1: --In the army than in the general society?
Speaker 2: Because the leadership of the army decided it needed to be done.  And between the secretaries of the army over those years, people like Stanley Resor, you know, and the like, and the people who became the chiefs of staff, Harold K. Johnson, who stands out in my mind as a great, great American, you know, and some others.  Because of them and they're saying it's going to be done, it got done.  And they used the mechanisms to get it done, without any force either.
Story_ID: 34203
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so this is a time, I guess, as we get towards the late '60s' (1960s), there're actually riots on aircraft carriers and that sort of thing, but not in the army?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you're getting up to three assignments later when I went back to Vietnam.  That was beginning to subside, but you had this thing, well I'm getting ahead, but we had this thing they used to call the dap(sp) where these soldiers bumped fists and elbows and things for two or three sometimes four or five minutes.  And they would do it anywhere.  They'd stand up in the dining facility and do it, you know.  And I went to the battalion that I took over in December, 1970, before the other guy gave it up.  And we were sitting in the dining room, it was about 20 officers, I think I was the only African American in the crowd, and here are these GIs standing up right next to us doing this dap.  I said nothing.  When I took over I told my sergeant major who is this highest non-commissioned officer in the unit, I said I want you to put the word out that I don't want any more dapping in my dining facilities, don't want any more dapping in my recreation halls, if you want to dap, you either dap outdoors or you dap in your barracks.  It all went away.
Speaker 1: Now why did you issue an order.  Now this was something that American soldiers were doing?
Speaker 2: Because the purpose that when you do that in the dining facility, here are two people sitting here eating, they're standing right beside them and two people slapping fists back and forth.  It's a disturbance.  It would be just as well stand up doing a dance, you know.  And it was being done as an intentional affront, and I didn't want that.  So they stopped.  They did it--do in the barracks, but don't do it in the dining facility.  Be just as though if somebody started singing a hillbilly song in the middle of while I'm trying to eat my dinner.  It wouldn't made no difference to me, you know, what it was.  And I had several other things in that nature that I did.  You have to wear a head cover and I had an officer's call--and NCO [non-commissioned officer] call and I said if a soldier is walking down the street and he doesn't have his cap on and you let him do it and don't stop him and challenge him, you just said it's okay to not wear your hat, that's what you said, now do you mean that, no, you don't mean that.  Well, then you have no choice but to say something.  About four days later I was walking through the compound, and I heard this sergeant say you better put your hat on before Colonel [Leo] Brooks sees you.  I let the soldier go by and I grabbed the sergeant and I said, that was the wrong answer.  The answer is you better put your hat on before I, the sergeant, sees you.  It's not because of Colonel Brooks, it's because it's right to wear your cover.  And I used several other homespun techniques of that nature to put my personality on that unit.
Story_ID: 34204
Speaker 1: It started off when I got there, it had 1800 people, which is a large battalion.  Most battalions run five, six hundred people. And when I left it had had 2600.  And the reason was we had begun to draw down in Vietnam.  This is on my second tour.  And the--as they would draw down in a distant area, up at Thuy Diem(sp) or Fantiet(sp) or Fangrang(sp) or someplace, they would always--they would have to leave a logistical support unit there for the troops that were left.  If they only left about a half or a third of the troops there, they could only leave about a half or a third of the support troops.  So they had to belong to somebody, so they'd attach them to my battalion.  So I ended up having about seven or eight distant sites from where my battalion was really located at Long Binh.  And so I had to travel to those rather frequently to maintain control.
Speaker 2: Now this is on your second tour?
Speaker 1: This is my second tour.  I was lieutenant colonel battalion commander.
Speaker 2: Okay, so when did you second tour start?
Speaker 1: It started--I got there in July, 1970, and came home in July, 1971.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I went over there assigned to a battalion at Tin Nhanh(sp) to go as a battalion commander.  I had asked my branch--the people in my personnel office called me several times and hey you ought to volunteer--you need to volunteer to go back to Vietnam, you know.  Your numbers going to come up soon, you volunteer you might get a nice job.  I said do you have a battalion for me to command.  Well we don't have one right now.  Well its--they constantly sending guys over there assigned to battalions, but they didn't have one for me.  Well at the time I was working for a major general.  He was a major general when I started off--named Henry A. Miley, Jr., M-I-L-E-Y, whom I had been his congressional assistant.  A very difficult job and he gained great confidence in me.  And so I went to him and said listen, they won't help me.  So he then wrote a general's private message to a general over there and said I need to get Brooks into a battalion.  The next day back came orders for me to go--instructions saying, you send him, I'll put him in such and such and such a battalion.  Well the personnel people called me and said you can't do that, we have to assigned, because I said I gave you six months to find a battalion, you couldn't find it, but the general could so I don't really need you.  So I went and of course between the four months from the time that happened and the time I got there that battalion was closed down.  So became a staff officer for six months and then I took over the largest battalion there, which was the 266.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And it turned out to be a blessing.
Story_ID: 34205
Speaker 1: All right let's do a little backtracking on the chronology a little bit.  So in the time between 1960, you know, after you got your master's degree, you went to Staff College at Fort Leavenworth?
Speaker 2: Yes, I went to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas for a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And one other thing we need to go back to.  While I was in Vietnam--before I went to Vietnam in 1963, we became pregnant again at my household and so while I was away, I had a daughter, and then that's where my three children are counted for.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: After going to the Command and General Staff College for a year, I was sent to the Pentagon, and having been as a young major up at [Fort] Holabird, I was a big dog, I was in charge of my own operation, my boss was in Washington [D.C.], I had no local supervision, so I really ran the place.  When I got to the Pentagon and I walked into the office where I was supposed to be assigned, the colonel shook my hand and said now, Major, if you go down the hall--or he says your desk will go over there and it was blank space.  He said if you go down the hall about three corridors around, you will find a pile of desks sitting out in the hallway, a big open hallway.  He said and you will see a dolly in there, you bring a desk up, pick out one for yourself and bring it up and that's where you will sit in the chair.  Well that was my introduction to the Pentagon, because majors were a dime a dozen in the Pentagon.  And I was down in the bowels where there were no light--no daylight at all.  After being there about four months, a young man had a heart attack upon the third floor, out on E ring, that's where the--and went to--and had to go to the hospital.  Well, the general that he was working for, he was his congressional assistant.  The general was about to go--had to testify on the [Capitol] Hill the following week.  So I was selected to go up there to take his job.  So there I was immediately in the fire and this is just before Thanksgiving.  And it's my first year in the Washington area since I've been in the army, first time I've been stationed there.  And we had arranged a big Thanksgiving dinner for all of my family and her family at the house that we had bought.  Well, early that morning the phone rang.  Leo, this is General [Henry Augustine] Miley, what time are you going to have Thanksgiving dinner, I said about two o'clock.  He said, all right, well come on in here now and you and I need to work to get ready for me to go the Hill on Monday.  So I went and when I got home, everybody was picking turkey out of their teeth with toothpicks about four thirty in the evening.  Now that was the beginning of a very difficult two and half years assignment.
Story_ID: 34206
Speaker 1: When he left that assignment, another two-star came in by the name of Fred Kornett, K-O-R-N-E-T-T, who was a lovely, lovely guy to deal with.  And my job was--I would go to the [Capitol] Hill and negotiate questions with staff members and help them to frame questions right, to get certain issues we wanted raised, and would answer questions in advance on some technical things for them.  So I had to be pretty skilled in my work.  And then I would go to the Hill with a principle and when a question was asked about some weapon system or some item in the budget, in the equipment budget, I had this briefcase that I would quickly run into the briefcase and snatch out a fax sheet and hand it to him so that he had all the real details, but he couldn't remember that on about eight or nine hundred items in the budget, in the equipment budget.  So I became very close to both of those two generals who saw in me whatever they thought was there.  One of them having said to me-- [Henry Augustine] Miley, having said to me, I should pay close attention to my task in this job, because while traveling around with him up with the chief of staff and his secretary helping, he said, you will see how generals behave, how they negotiate, how they disagree and what not, and he says you'll learn a lot.  What it did turn out to be a wonderful, wonderful lesson, not ever thinking I'd be one at that point anyway.  So my three years there was intense the entire time, but a blessing.  I'll say this about it, down the hall--down in the concourse of the Pentagon was Woodward and Lothrop, a Woodward and Lothrop store and about once a month, sometimes twice a month, I would go in that Woodward and Lothrop store and buy my wife a dress.  That's back in the days in the late '60s' (1960s), that's in the days of miniskirts.  So I would go there and buy her a dress which she wore up until, until they went back to pants and these ugly mixed up black and green and gray colors and I quit buying after that.
Story_ID: 34207
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So now you received a bronze star for service in 1970.  Was this for service in Vietnam or service in the Pentagon?
Speaker 2: In Vietnam.
Speaker 1: Vietnam, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, got a bronze star and I also got the Legion of Merit as a battalion commander, which was kind of uncommon.  Most folks were getting what's called a meritorious service medal.
Speaker 1: So Legion of Merit is a higher award?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It award that signifies that you were doing a job that deserved to be rewarded?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was not, I would say probably half of the battalion commanders would get, might get a Legion of Merit because it was tough work.  And my greatest goal in 1970 was, you know, was to do the job and take care of the men, because we had some very difficult problems in Vietnam at the time.  Not the least of which was heroin and it is still with us today.  I run a homeless shelter in my church during the winter, and we still have veterans from Vietnam, men who are now in their sixties and seventies, late sixties and seventies who were touched by the heroin and never have fully recovered.  I could tell stories on and on about when I went to the battalion, the first commanders' meeting I went to they put up a chart that showed the number of drug incidents in battalions and the commander--the group commander looked at it and said now look at the 266, by which is the battalion I had, said that's the way your record should look.  Well we had the lowest number of incidents.  After I had been there two months we were two times higher than anybody.  And he wondered what's going on down there, I'm doing my job, I'm catching them.  I'm not hiding them, I'm catching them.  And I was.  I came across a soldier with his head on his desk at two o'clock in the morning, because I used to walk through the barracks all hours a night.  And this soldier had, you know, was asleep with his head on the--and the powder all over the desk.  I just grabbed him by the back of his shirt, raised him up slowly, woke him up and took him out.  Took him up to my headquarters and read him his rights, said you're going to jail and I'm going to see to it because I caught you myself, and I'm going to put you--I'm going to see that you go to jail for a long time.  Well I knew that wouldn't happen, but I threatened him that way, I said if you don't tell me where this came from.  So he told me how the--that a maid would bring it in each morning about nine o'clock.  We couldn't search the maids.  You couldn't have men search the maids.  I had a female sergeant who had worked for me during my first six months there when I was on the staff I sent for her and had her down at my battalion.  When this woman came through, we trapped her, took her in the barracks and she had two hundred viles, little capsules with about a half ounce of heroin in each one sewn into her clothes underneath her garments.  And so I then called my boss, said sir, you need to come down here right away.  And I called his boss, the brigadier general, and I called his boss, the major general, I said, you need to see this right away.  And they came and they saw it, I have pictures of it now. Here's all this heroin right there and I said and that's what these soldiers are going through, and there's no need to try to hide it.
Story_ID: 34208
Speaker 1: That's something.
Speaker 2: Two days later a mysterious hand grenade blew up right outside of my hooch.(laughing)--
Speaker 1: A hooch is the--
Speaker 2: --It didn't bother me--
Speaker 1: --Name for a soldiers' dwelling in Vietnam?
Speaker 2: --Beg your pardon?
Speaker 1: Yeah, a hooch.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a house.
Speaker 1: A hooch.  Tell us what a hooch is?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's where you sleep?
Speaker 1: Did you sleep in a regular hooch?
Speaker 2: Well, no I had a little house that I had one room, my battalion exec had a room and my battalion operations officer had the third one.  We had our own little shower in there. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now at this point now are you a colonel by now.
Speaker 2: I'm a lieutenant colonel.
Speaker 1: Lieutenant colonel, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, have you--I mean what do you think of--I know a lot has been written about African American soldiers in Vietnam.  There was a book a few years ago called "Bloods," it's about the black enlisted man's, you know, experience in Vietnam.  Have you read that?
Speaker 2: I have not read it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Do you have any thoughts about it.  I think some of the books make reference to the disproportionate number of African American soldiers who got killed or wounded in Vietnam, you know, percentage-wise compared to other soldiers and why?
Speaker 2: I am not sensitive to that issue, it may be so.
Speaker 1: Does it sound likely to you?
Speaker 2: I would not have guessed that, and if it was--because they were heavier, many of them in combat units, many, but they were heavier in logistics units, the support units.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So least-wise they'd be less likely to--
Speaker 2: Well, I'm not going to draw that conclusion, although there may be an implication to that because I don't know.
Speaker 1: --Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I've never been sensitized to that fact before.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this second tour was from 1970 to '71 (1971).
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now was there any indication in those days that the war was going to come to a conclusion?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We'd begun to draw down.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we were drawing down under the--under the cover of a story that we were turning things over to the army of Vietnam--
Speaker 1: Was that--
Speaker 2: --But which they did not have the ability to sustain.
Speaker 1: --Okay.  So you came back--did you come back to the country in '71 (1971)?
Speaker 2: I came right back and I went to work for that same General [Henry Augustine] Miley again.  I became the deputy secretary of the general staff of the army material command.  That was the here in the Washington [D.C.] area at the time.  Now the deputy secretary of the general staff is the, I would call him the paper dealer.  He's the guy who makes sure that all the documents that are going up for the general's signature are in the correct order, that all the attachments are there, that all of the issues are covered properly, but it's not just an administrative but it's a technical job also to make sure that the issues are covered and the right people have agreed or disagreed and if the responses to the disagreements are there and what not.  And I did that for a year before I went to the National War College.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In Washington, D.C.
Story_ID: 34209
Speaker 1: It's come to our attention as we do this research that every time someone goes to National War College, they usually get a promotion afterwards?
Speaker 2: Well, generally, about seventy-five percent of them will make colonel, probably more than that back in those days, probably eighty-five percent would make colonel and something like twenty percent will make general, flag--because we had all services, all but become ambassadors or something of that nature, yeah, yeah.  But that number is about the--it's very similar to the other senior service schools also.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you went to National War College.  This is in '72' (1972)?
Speaker 2: Summer of '72' (1972).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what was your curriculum there, I mean what were you studying?
Speaker 2: Well you studied strategic issues more than anything else.  You didn't study anything--it's called the National War College--it was called National War College but it's more about geopolitical strategies, things of that nature, issues that affect national power as opposed to tactical issues and the like.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  I know you had mentioned that ambassadors go there too?
Speaker 2: Well, see our class was one quarter army, one quarter air force, one quarter navy and marines and one quarter civilians.  And the civilians, many of them were from the state department and then the other service--well there were a couple from the department of the army, senior civilians and from some other agencies.  We had one fella from the department of agriculture, and one from the forest service, I remember, yeah.
Story_ID: 34210
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now you went back to Vietnam in '72' (1972), but to Cambodia, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  No, no, no, I'm done.  After '71' (1971), I'm done with Vietnam.  After, after, after--after the National War College, I went to the office of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which I begged to go there, and I'll tell you why.  I had two boys in high school, and I wanted them to finish Jefferson High School in Fairfax County [Virginia].  Jefferson High School was not a magnet school at the time, but it was a good high school, and I wanted them to finish before I moved.  They meant more to me than anymore advancement in the service.  So I knew if I got assigned to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I would be locked in for three years.  Well, I only lasted thirteen months and was selected to command the Sacramento Army Depot.  Well, the selection process for colonel level is such an important event that you dare not miss that and so having been selected, I packed my kids up and we went to California.  I was first told I was going to Lexington, Kentucky, and my youngest son, who was six-four was delighted because that's the basketball capital of the world.  And then I came back and said, we're going to California, to Sacramento, which they knew nothing about and I came back home a couple days later having talked with a guy I was going to replace and said, and I'm going to put you in a Jesuit high school, and they said well what does that mean.  I says there are no girls.  Well my oldest boy looked at me down the dining room table with tears in his eyes and says, dad, why are you going to punish us like this.  Needless to say when we got to California, and I took them over to the high school standing on the sidewalk waiting for us was the principal, the assistant principal, the basketball coach, the football coach and a couple other members of the faculty, like a role of penguins all dressed in their black clothes with white collars to see them, and I remember the basketball coach looking at Vincent, the six-four son, putting his hands on his head and he said awesome. (laughing)  I will never forget it.  Well, the next day the oldest boy went to football practice and wallowed in the school and Vincent did too, they had a ball there.  And there were plenty of girls around at the high schools that were kind of paired with them, all the girls are high school (unclear).  So they had a good time there, and they didn't miss a beat.
Story_ID: 34211
Speaker 1: They both graduated with honors and did very well.  I remember the--before we left Virginia, while they were in Jefferson High School, the oldest boy came home one day and he said, Dad, you know, Billy Martin, who was a friend of his, a boy who was a guard on the football team, Leo by the way had been a running back and he's getting' ready to go into his senior year in high school and was easily going to be the first string running back, and he was also--had just come from Boy's State, was really riding high in high school, and he said Billy Martin said he's joining the debating team so that his record will look good for him to go to [United States Military Academy at] West Point and I said well, if you want to go you'd better make sure you're into something too.  So he looked over at his brother Vincent and said, hey Vince, me go to West Point and he started ribbing me about it and I said nothing, I let it go.  Well when it came SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test] time, I said I want you to check that block up there that allows your record to go the military academies and that's all I want you to do just check the block, you don't need to go, just check the block.  Well then he took the SAT and we went off to California.  After being out there for about three or four months, we get a phone call into my office, and my secretary comes in and says, sir, there's a Captain Briggs on the phone from West Point who wants to come out and interview your son to recruit him to the academy.  I said I don't want to talk to him I don't want him near me.  You have him to call the house, talk to my wife and let them do it and I don't want to be involved.  She was shocked, but I intentionally did that so that--the captain came out, talked to him, I still make like I know little or nothing about it, the captain leaves, comes to my office then, stops by, and I thank him, what not, and I appreciate--was appreciative of his behavior, and he went on back to West Point.  So a couple of days later, my son says, Dad, you haven't said anything about West Point.  I says well, what do you want?  I kept the pressure on him and not on me.  Finally he says well, I'll put the application in.  So we filled out the application.  I says in the meantime we're going to fill out two, one in Ohio, where we were residence of, because I had made residence there when I was at Central State and one someplace else.  So he applied at Bowling Green University in Ohio and he applied at San Diego State in California, was accepted at both.  I said now which one you really going to go to?  He says well I'll go back to Ohio, because you're going to be leaving here anyway soon.  In the meantime the West Point thing comes through.  So he heads off to West Point.  I says now I'm going to pay the deposit for a room at Bowling Green so that if you get up there in the summer and you don't like it or you can't cut it, you don't have to wait till spring to apply to go to college someplace, you can just come on back and go straight to Ohio to school. Well that left the heat totally on his back.
Story_ID: 34212
Speaker 1: Well he went there and wrote me the best letter I have ever received in my life, a letter of thanks for having led him to where he was and several other very personal issues.  I have a copy of that letter that I read every year at Christmastime.  I read it to myself and put it right back in the folder.  And of course he stayed there and he came home at Christmastime, and we met him in San Francisco.  We were still in Sacramento, met him in San Francisco and brought him home, and we sat up talking till the wee hours of the morning, and Vincent disappeared from the room.  And all of a sudden he came back in the room and he had rifled Leo's suitcase and had on his full uniform, complete with the hat and what not with his bush sticking out up from underneath of the hat, his hairdo, and we all laughed about it.  And we went to bed and I said to my wife before I went to sleep, I said, I think Vincent is hooked too, she says, naw.  I said, yes he is.  Well sure enough when Leo went back he told then Coach Kryzewsky who was the West Point coach at the time, he told him, he said, it's a shame my brother hurt his elbow on the rim playing basketball the other day, which caught Krzyzewsky's attention.
Speaker 2: This is Mike Krzyzewsky or the--
Speaker 1: Mike Krzyzewsky, yes, because he was the coach at West Point at the time.  So he then wanted some film.  So the coach from Sacramento Jesuit High School, sent the film.  So he says I want him.  So he then--we went through a quick process and he was accepted.  He had already been accepted at Creighton University as a pre-medical student and had already had engagement with the local alumni there in Sacramento there and what not, they were already to have him, and he had also been accepted to go play basketball on a basketball scholarship at Cornell University, but there was no scholarship, there was a scholarship, but it was academic scholarship at Creighton in Nebraska.  So he went, played one year and came home at Christmastime and said, Dad, I don't like it, he said, the coach doesn't play his bench, he plays six people and this is too hard a work for me to be there and sitting on a bench.  I want to quit, what do you think?  I says quit if you want to.  He quit.  And he got serious--deep into his studies because a kid on the basketball team at West Point has to meet all of those same requirements that the other people about being up at five-thirty in the morning.  I don't care that they've been down to temple, down in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] the night before and they get home at one-thirty o'clock in the morning or two o'clock in the morning, he's still got to get up at five-thirty.  And he says I'm just not getting my work well and what not.  And he finished very high in his class.
Speaker 2: I think at the top.
Speaker 1: And number one in military studies.  So that's how they got there, yeah.  But Sacramento turned out to be a wonderful assignment (unclear).
Story_ID: 674152
Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My name is Leo Austin Brooks [HistoryMaker Major General Leo Brooks, Sr.].  It's L-E-O, A-U-S-T-I-N, B-R-O-O-K-S.
Speaker 1: All right.  And you're Leo Austin Brooks, Sr., right?
Speaker 2: No, I'm, I'm neither junior nor senior.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, explain this now.  This is--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, my son [HistoryMaker Brigadier General Leo Brooks, Jr.] is a junior--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but I never changed my name when he was born.  I never added, rather, the senior.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So, I'm learning something about name protocol now.  So, and what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My date of birth is August the 9th, 1932, and because I was born in Washington, D.C., but three days after being born, I lived in Alexandria [Virginia].
Speaker 1: And, sir, what is your title and occupation?  I guess your title is when you retired and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, I am retired now from the United States Army and from some other activities subsequent to my retirement.  I no longer am employed, am employed--I'm fully retired.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, but you retired with the rank of--
Speaker 2: It's kind of a tricky thing.  I retired as a brigadier general, but I was a major general, a two-star general on active duty when I retired.  And the reason was, the reason is, is when, if you retired before you get three years in grade, you retire at the next lower rank.  And I only had eighteen months as a major general when I retired, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You had attained the rank of major general and you--
Speaker 2: I did what?
Speaker 1: --you had attained that rank when you retired?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: You had functioned as a major general?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And so, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is December the 2nd, 2013.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're in Fairfax County, Virginia.
Speaker 1: All right.  And we are completing an interview that we began in July, correct?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 674153
Speaker 1: And we left off during the last years of the Vietnam War, 1971.  You were--do you have any last thoughts about, about Vietnam, about your tour in Vietnam?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, as I look back at the pain that came out of that war, and to see, even today, the, the damaged people from that war, it, it brings, it brings great, great remorse.  Drugs were so prevalent.  And so many young men became addicted that, even today, there, there are still remnants of their pain.  And I can say that because, as a community and church matter, I have, for the last sixteen years, been a coordinator of a homeless shelter.  And as a result of that, as you interview these young men, or these men, we see that many of them are still victims of having been addicted to drugs way back in, in the '70s [1970s], and '60s [1960s], and '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: So, many of them are Vietnam vets [veterans]?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.  These are men who now, and the most men in last, sixties and seventies, yeah, yeah, early seventies, yes.  And, and then, and this, a great percentage of our homeless population is from that era and that experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And in terms of the--I mean, when, do you have any thoughts about Vietnam now, in terms of where it stands in the--
Speaker 2: Well, it's--there was a sergeant who, who was, met the secretary of defense at the time, down I understand it was in the train where it happened.  And he said, "Serge, how is, how are things going?"  And the sergeant said, "We're pouring water down a rat hole.  We, we're wasting time."  Well, the sergeant was sent home, but he turned out to be right in the end because, you know, what we got out of it for what we put into it, in lives and hearts and dollars, did not turn out to be worth the investment, yeah.
Story_ID: 674154
Speaker 1: So, you got the word to, that you were to come back in '71 [1971], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I came back from Vietnam in '71 [1971], and became the deputy secretary of the general staff of the U.S. Army Materiel Command which was in Washington [D.C.].  I had worked prior to going, going to, to Vietnam.  I had worked for then-Major General Henry A. Miley [Henry A. Miley, Jr.], and upon returning, he said, keep in touch with me because he had apparently liked the kind of work that I did for him under some very high pressure, which we spoke about earlier.  And so, I went to work as his deputy general, deputy secretary of his, of his staff.  And that lasted for a year, and I was selected to go to the National War College, which is in Washington, D.C., a rather prestigious experience.  There, you get to become acquainted with many people who end up the leaders of, of the military forces as, as well as civilians, because they are--one-quarter of the class is, was made up of civilians from the state department [U.S. Department of State], agriculture [U.S. Department of Agriculture], the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency], from various sundry places, some very senior civilians.  And so, you get to know these people and develop a relationship that carries on through the rest of your service, yeah.  The National War College is, is a place where you study global matters.  It's not tactics, it's not when you--though, it's called, was called the National War College.  You, you don't study battles and things of that nature.  You study geopolitical involvement, elements of national power, and the like.  And you, that's a year-long program.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm glad you pointed that out because--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --most people think, what would a civilian do at National War College, you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But it's geopolitical--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --studies that are pursued.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, you're dealing with economics, international economics, and finance, and things of that nature, yeah, yeah, pretty high level.
Story_ID: 674155
Speaker 1: Upon finishing that assignment, or near my finishing of that assignment, my sons [HistoryMaker Brigadier General Leo Brooks, Jr. and HistoryMaker General Vincent Brooks] were in high school.  And I wanted them to stay in Jefferson High School [Thomas Jefferson High School; Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology] in Fairfax County [Virginia].  At the time, it was not a magnet school.  It was just a good high school, and I wanted them to finish that high school.  So, I encouraged, and was assigned to the office of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  I became the Cambodian desk officer in the logistics office or J4, where I dealt with such issues as the decline of foodstuffs during the, the latter days of, of Cambodia before it fell, and thought I would be there because, normally, when you go to JCS, you stay there for a good three years.  I only lasted thirteen months (laughter) because I, I think I mentioned, and if I didn't, I'll, I'll mention again.  While in the National War College [Washington, D.C.], I was selected for promotion to colonel.  I had not expected it because the year group that was being considered was two years ahead of me.  We normally do it by, by year group, fiscal year group.  And it was two years ahead of me, which meant that one year ahead of me was what we called the secondary zone, where they would normally pick something like, 10 percent of the people from that zone who are allegedly doing better than the average bear, and they're promoted along with the folks who are in the regular zone.  But when the promotion list came out, I was on it, and I was two years below.  I subsequently learned that there were ten of us, ten people picked out of, out of the entire force, for that double below the zone selection.

Speaker 1: Just a question about the Cambodian desk.  Now, this is, so you were handling supply concerns, food, for the Cambodian government--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, well, at the, at the Joint Chiefs of Staff level, the, the actual handling of these commodities and things of that nature are done way below you.  But an auditor determined the continued viability of the nation, or the survivability of, of it.  And foodstuffs, ammunition, fuel, things of that nature are, are quite an important matter.  And it was my job to keep an eye on, on the status of that.  And I got a daily report directly out of Cambodia as, as to what, what the statuses of these things were because you had not only the, the Cambodian Army [Royal Cambodian Army], but you also had the civilians who had to have foodstuffs.  And they were pretty much cut off, except for what rice, salt, et cetera, that came from the United States, or from other countries that the United States provided to them, usually through the [U.S.] Agency for International Development, or something of that, some other source of that nature.
Speaker 1: Now, I was just thinking and just reflecting back on this era in my head about the news stories coming out.  And I wondered if you had any thoughts about the comparison between Cambodia and Vietnam because in terms of the, the U.S. is here getting out of Vietnam, where many people say we really probably shouldn't be in, in the first place.  But Cambodia, we kind of, we get out of there, too, but Cambodia is besieged by Pol Pot and Khmer Rouge, which proves historically--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, we were--
Speaker 1: --now, we know it's a disastrous group.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They waid laste [sic.] to the country.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well--
Speaker 1: I mean, they laid waste the country and--
Speaker 2: --well we were playing a much lesser role.  We were not using conventional forces in Cambodia as we did in, in Vietnam.  It was mostly, mostly support through other, other agencies as, as well as people like special forces, et cetera, to assist the country and the--those friendly to, to the, still friendly to the U.S.  But they, another big difference was Cambodia has got, got a coastline--I'm sorry, Vietnam has a coastline that extends the length of the country.  So, resupplying it, while we were there, was nowhere near as difficult as it was to get products into Cambodia, yeah.  It would have been a much more difficult proposition.  In fact, the last, one of the last acts before I left was helping to arrange for a U.S. Navy vessel to go down to New Orleans [Louisiana], and pick up a trainload of rice that had been shipped from Stuttgart, Arkansas, and to be loaded and, and gotten over there as quickly as we could.  It was of our last ditch efforts, but it wasn't long after that before it was a matter of history.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have any, do you think that maybe the U.S. should have applied more military might in Cambodia--
Speaker 2: Oh, I--
Speaker 1: --rather than Vietnam in terms of--
Speaker 2: --oh, I don't really have an educated opinion on that.  I, I was just primarily involved in doing what we could do, based on the instructions that were left with us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 674157
Speaker 1: So, you were on the Cambodian desk thirteen months, you said, right?  And then--
Speaker 2: Yes, I stayed in J- the Joint Chiefs of Staff's office for thirteen months.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and a- another good thing happened to me while I, as I said, I thought I'd gotten myself locked into three years, so that my sons [HistoryMaker Brigadier General Leo Brooks, Jr. and HistoryMaker General Brooks] could finish the high school [Thomas Jefferson High School; Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Fairfax County, Virginia] they were in.  One of the boys was about to become the captain of the football team.  He was already the--he, he had been the lead running back in his junior year.  And the other boy was a, was a sophomore, and was--well, then, the number two scorer on the basketball team.  And one was in Boys State [American Legion Boys State] debating team--several things.  They were just all balled up into the high school, and both were doing very well academically, and I didn't want that to move.  But, along came orders where I had been selected to go to Sacramento [California] to become the commander of the Sacramento Army Depot.  Oh, when I, I got those orders, I was in contact with, with my predecessor who was already there.  And he said, "You don't want to put your kids in the public school here because it's not a very good high school.  Its reputation is pretty bad.  You probably want to put your kids in the, in the Jesuit High School [Jesuit High School, Carmichael, California]."  And I said, "Well, we'll see when we get there."  But, I told my sons at the dinner table one night that we, we would, they were probably going to go to a Jesuit high school.  Well, the basketball son just lit up in glee because he knows the kind of athletic programs that most Jesuit high schools, and in the league that, that high school was in.  He was delighted.  The--I said, "But there are no girls in the high school--it's an all-boys school."  And I can remember my oldest son with the glassy eyes looking over toward me, and he said, "Dad, why are you going to punish us like that (laughter)?"  Well, it turned out not to be a punishment because there, there were four girls' high schools that were kind of matched up with, with the boys', two boys' high schools in, there in Sacramento, and it didn't make a difference.  But, so we went to Sacramento in the summer of 1974, and it was probably as, as fun of an assignment as an officer could ever have.
Story_ID: 674158
Speaker 1: Now, did you go as a colonel?
Speaker 2: I was a colonel, a brand, a brand new colonel.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And I had four other colonels there [Sacramento Army Depot, Sacramento, California] working for me, all of whom had been colonels much longer than I--one about three years.  But the, the system is whoever is the commander is the commander.  And, and the tradition and, and the practices that, that rests, just sort of step out of the commander's way, and the commander becomes in charge.  But, the good thing about that assignment was, while my family is not normally involved in my work, they were deeply involved in the community, and so was I.  We, we automatically, as, as a major employer, you know, there were about six thousand employees there.  That's a major employer in the city and in that community.  You become a part of the chamber of commerce, service organizations.  I was invited to be a member of the board of, of directors of the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], the Urban League [National Urban League] and, and several other things.  My wife [Naomi Lewis Brooks] was a member of the board of the blood bank, the Red Cross [American Red Cross], Girl Scouts [Girl Scouts of the United States of America], and, and other actives, so you become very involved in the community, which, which is a broadening experience that, otherwise, you wouldn't get if you were stuck on a, on an [U.S.] Army post, buried with, into, into thousands of other people.
Story_ID: 674159
Speaker 1: But there we had about three thousand people involved in the rebuild of electronics equipment, night vision, radar, communications, navigation, and, and other kinds of electronics items.  And, and I also had the distribution mission for, for general supplies for most of the west, the United--western, the Pacific, and the western United States.  And there, there were about twelve hundred people in, in that part of the operation.  The, the great challenge then was the, the--we were beginning to reduce, or beginning another iteration of the reduction of [U.S.] military forces because the Vietnam War was over and so, you got to make space for--in order to save money.  The [U.S.] Army wanted to, to combine the logistics on distribution mission with my depot at Sacramento [Sacramento Army Depot, Sacramento, California], and the depot down at, at Stockton [Stockton Ordnance Depot, Stockton, California], which is about fifty, sixty miles away.  And it became quite a political tussle, and we didn't, we--it, it was resolved after I left.  But, I ended up getting sued, you know, but, of course, we prevailed in the suit.  And I ended up on (laughter) Easter weekend, this, the Friday before the Easter holiday, in the federal court [United States District Court for the Eastern District of California] down in Sacramento, where we had been sued under the, under the, in an attempt to, to claim that the right kind of environmental study was not made before the decision to move the workout, workout of my depot down to Sacramento.  And I remembered while we were there in that room, and the court, that federal courtroom, right down the hall, they were trying Steven Soliah, who was a part of the Panther, and I'm--not Panther, but the movement with Patty, Patty Hearst and-(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, Symbionese Liberation--
Speaker 1: --Symbionese Liberation Army, yeah, yeah (laughter), right, right down the hall from us.  But that was an interesting experience to find myself in, and it was finally, and the judge finally gave a bench ruling about six o'clock in the evening.  I had to have the arrangements to be--well, take my family out to Clearlake [California] for the weekend, but we ended up not being able to go because of that.  The, the mission of that depot was quite important.  Not far away from us was McClellan Air Force Base [California], which also had a similar kind of mission, but its mission was geared mostly to [U.S.] Air Force particular items, while we handled items that were primarily Army and Marine [U.S. Marine Corps] and ground forces items.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, was that the Air Force Materiel Command center (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: Okay, at McClellan?
Speaker 1: Yes, um-hm.
Story_ID: 674160
Speaker 1: Now, were you, now '73 [1973] was like a, was a pivotal year in the history of the [U.S.] Army because of the cessation of the draft, right?  They--that's when the draft was ended in 1973?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the U.S. Army adopted something called Total Force Policy.  And can you tell what that is?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it didn't really impact me until two years later.  And we'll get to that, but because I had so few [U.S.] military people.  Out, out of the almost six thousand people, I had less than forty military, and they were all professionals, you know.  They were not draftees--no, no draftees in, in there.  And most of them were, were rather mature officers.  I only had about six or seven enlisted persons.  All, all the rest were officers, who were specialists in maintenance activities and, and finance, general supply, or transportation, or something of that nature.  Our communications, and I had a security officer, you know, and what-not.  So, I, I--that didn't, didn't impact me personally very much until the--I, I--two years later, when I went to Fort Hood, Texas.  To get a command as a colonel, it was in the beginning of the days with the--what we started to having as command selection boards.  And that's where a group of senior people sit and, and cull through personnel files to find potential senior officers, more senior officers to give them the experience, as well as put, put these organizations into the best hands possible to do these.  The board picks, picks people for this, and I was selected for that to go to Sacramento [California].  Now the problem is this.  And I don't know whether it still exists thirty years later, but when you pick a, an officer from what we call for wholesale logistics, a depot, that, that's pretty much wholesale.  He doesn't get experience with retail, and that's when you're with troops because with troops, you're, you're--it's, it's on a daily basis.  You're not, you're not looking real, very far forward.  You're, and except that as it, as it pertains to long term missions of a unit, but your, your job is to keep the readiness up of the unit that you support.  So, the, the problem was we were training senior logi- logisticians, who were wholesale.  But the combat arms officers, who kinda are the majority that sit on selection boards, would rather have the people who've been dealing directly with soldiers in the retail business.  So, someone had, had decided, well, "What we need to do is we need to make sure we have people who've done both."  Well, of course, I'd had a retail level assignment as a battalion commander in Vietnam.  I'd had a wholesale assignment before that, supporting the intelligence community.  So, now, going to Sacramento.  That was a wholesale assignment.  So, the, the next time they had a board, they decided to double, double-command ten people, and I turned out to be one of those.  So, I ended up leaving Sacramento, and going to Fort Hood, Texas where I was made the commander of the 13th corps support command [13th Sustainment Command].
Story_ID: 674161
Speaker 1: Fort Hood, Texas, right.
Speaker 2: Yes.  The, the U.S. Army's III Corps has its headquarters at Fort Hood, Texas.  At that time, the III Corps was made up of the 2nd Armored Division, the 1st Cavalry Division, the, the 3rd Air Cav Brigade [sic. 1st Air Cavalry Divisions; 1st Cavalry Division], and the other major organization was the 13th corps support command [13th Sustainment Command].  And its job is to provide the intermediate level of logistic support, as well as the retail support to those units.  Now, Fort Hood, at that time, was the largest concentration of U.S. forces in the world.  There were fifty five thousand military people alone.  They're not to include the families or the civilian workforce, anything of that nature, with more than three hundred helicopters, two divisions of tanks, and armored personnel carriers and, and mechanized artillery, which made it quite a large operation to support.  I'll talk about the 13th corps support command in, in two ways--one about its logistic activities and two, about the chemistry.  Let's talk about the, the chemistry first.  We're now in the year 1976.  We had not many years before that started to, to feeding females into troop units, fully integrated in there, not as a company of females in it, but females scattered in the units.  And this unit was one of the first units to have that to happen to it, and it had begun about two and a half years before I got there.  The environment, I would not say was toxic, but some portions of it were not wholesome for females.  And some portions of it were good and, of course, we had to ferret out, the unwholesome parts to make it good.
Speaker 1: Now, did the unwholesome--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --or the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --in attitude, in attitude about females.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  I had a question though.  Did the type of unit have anything to do with the type of reception the females received?
Speaker 2: No, I just think it was the attitude that men had, and to a significant degree, many still have about females--condescension, et cetera.
Story_ID: 674162
Speaker 1: By the time I left, I didn't have any females who were battalion commanders because I had nine battalions.  And, among them were in that outfit, was about nine thousand people, but I did have some female company commanders.  And one of them--I will remember her the rest of my life, Captain Donna Lightfoot was, without a doubt, one of the best company commanders in the, out of the, the 46th or 47th companies that I had.  She, you know, ran the unit well.  It, all of its important functions were done well.  Its morale was at the top, but not so, you know, she was a shining example that I had, but they were not fit.  They had not gotten to the point where they were feeding very many female officers in.  So, out of the nine thousand we were at about seven or eight hundred females.  We had gotten to that point, and it was climbing, steadily climbing.  I had only one female field grade officer, a major, who was my adjutant general, but other, other than that, they, they were mostly enlisted people.  And it, it presented some, some problems.  We had one instance where my sergeant major came to me and said, we have a young lady who works in our com- in our computer--this is, these are, these are van-mounted computers, so that they can go to the field, go anywhere, and she works in the computers with, in, in the computer van.  And she's complaining that a sergeant there manages to bump into her, claiming accidentally, because it's very narrow and confined quarters.  And she, and, and he says, "And I want to move her."  I said, "No, no, no, we're not moving her.  We're going to move him.  What we're going to do is move him down a grade" (laughter).  So, we immediately converted the process from a transfer of her out to a disciplinary action against him.  And, and we had, here, we had several experiences like that.  I had one--one of the battalion commanders used to make jokes in, in public about, about his, his female troops.  Well, if you don't, if you don't attack those kinds of attitudes, they get worse, and they become, they become accepted behavior.
Story_ID: 674163
Speaker 1: We also had--one of the di- one of the disadvantages in an, in an outfit like that was when the service is, when the, when the personnel people are dividing up the resources, the, the quote cream of the crop, when they go to troop units, go to the divisions.  That's the glory.  Even with the logisticians, they go to the divisions.  The, the--among field grade officers, the cream of the crop is either in a division for the most part, or it was in the Pentagon [Washington, D.C.] and headquarters department of the [U.S.] Army.  Then, you begin to take off the next level coming down, and the--by the time you would get officers into a command like mine, you're getting for the most part, except for the battalion commanders, you're getting secondary and tertiary officers who'll become much more difficult to motivate.  Many of them are attempting to, were attempting to live out their twentieth anniversary, so that they could retire and, or not very motivated to, to work hard.  So, your leadership problems become more acute and, and it takes a lot more direct involvement of senior officers to make that work.  I enjoyed it.  One of the things when I got there, I discovered that the divisions in the 3rd Air Cav [1st Air Cavalry Divisions; 1st Cavalry Division] were all--when they would put on their fatigue uniforms, they had on fatigue colored shirts, undershirts, the 13th corps support command [13th Sustainment Command] had on white tee shirts, you know, wore white tee shirts, and I wondered why.  Well, the answer was, "Well, that's the way we do it."  I said, "You got two weeks to get nine thousand people out of these white tee shirts and into, to, the camouflage colored tee shirt.  You go to the field--you're either a soldier, or you're not a soldier.  You go to war, you're not going to do that.  Why are you doing it now?  You got to be practicing what you're going to do.  You need to change your attitude."  And we spent a lot of time working on changing the attitude of that organization.  And I think we very successfully did it because we saw the results.
Story_ID: 674164
Speaker 1: As far as its logistics were concerned, the [U.S.] Army had moved into that organization, and another similar one at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  Some of the responsibilities that had been handled by the civilians at the installation, the more technical supply matters, the more technical maintenance matters, and things of that nature, and transportation matters.  But I had assigned what was called an inventory management center, okay.
Speaker 2: So, what year is this?  This is in--
Speaker 1: We're now in 1976, '7 [1977], and '8 [1978].
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, okay.
Speaker 1: The management of, of these things take--a handling of these issues takes a little bit more skill.  But I, you know, but they had assigned this, the, officers to me and, and a few NCOs [noncommissioned officer] who, who had been individually trained, and we had to make a management, an inventory management center out of these people.  So, I, as the commander, spent a significant portion of my time dealing with the inventory management center, the movement's control center, and the other more technical problems with the, with the computer management, etcetera.  And so, I had to turn over to my deputy commander to watch out for the troop units, you know, in the barracks, et cetera.  That was my--I, I moved to my higher skill dealing with, with those issues where, well, where I was, could do the best, and what, what needed the most attention in order to get these things off the ground.  We also got the chance to build from scratch a battalion whose job it was to rebuild tank, and other armored vehicle engines and transmissions.  And these G.I.'s went from scratch and, and were rebuilding these engines.  We reduced the demand for, for replacement engines at Fort Hood [Texas] by a significant amount of money, which could then be turned around, and be used to buy track and other things to support these vehicles.  And there were those who said, "These G.I.s can't do that." Well, they did it, and they did it well.  And it's an experiment that, an experience that, that lives on until today in, in the history of how troops can do those kinds of things, as they did do in World War II [WWII].  Yeah, we were back to that.  One of the, one of my regrets from that organization is that I could not get more of my officers to higher suc- succeeding grades.  And that was partially because I was getting second tier for the most part, good people, but they were not the real cream.  And the manifestation of that is that the battalion commanders, most of them made colonel, but that was about the only people who would make colonel.  And I had a lot, I had over five hundred officers in that organization.  And I would have liked to have had, seen some more people climb, climb out of there.  Now, working beside me, as the 13th corps support commander [13th Sustainment Command], as I said, was the 2nd Armored Division, and whose commander at the time was George S. Patton III.  And Julius Becton [HistoryMaker General Julius Becton, Jr.] was the commander of the 1st Cavalry Division.  They were both major generals and, and who were very helpful to me in getting my job done.  And, of course, I was helpful to them, too, because I was supporting their, their units.
Story_ID: 674165
Speaker 1: If you look back through life as an [U.S.] Army officer and you say, "Who was the best example or the worst example of various and sundry things?"  If I had to pick the best example of a leader, it would have been the man who was the commander of the III Corps when I got there who, who was a leader who you did not--he did not have to raise his voice.  He did not have to be stern or, or ugly in his behavior.  He was just such a good leader that you wanted to make sure that nothing went wrong because you didn't want to let him down.  It wasn't that you were afraid of him.  His name was Robert Shoemaker [Robert M. Shoemaker] who lives today in full retirement, still down there in Texas.
Speaker 2: That's S-H--
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: His name is spelled S-H--
Speaker 1: Shoemaker, S-H-O-E-M-A-K-E-R.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I know sometime they spell with a U so I was just making sure.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And he--and I learned an awful lot from him.  I learn a lot from a lot of people, but he was, he turned out to be a very important person in my life.  His deputy, on the other hand, was the exact opposite (laughter), who was a firebrand man with no patience, abrasive tongue (laughter), and, and an un- and, and a vocabulary that I would not like to repeat very much of.  But who General Becton [HistoryMaker General Julius Becton, Jr.] had said to me beforehand, "Be careful of him--he's hard on people."  Well, my daddy [Houston Brooks, Sr.] taught me as a kid when you're dealing with people, when you run into a bully, just stare him in the eye.  Don't smile, don't duck your head, you know, don't, don't frown, just stare him in the eye, and they'll soon go away.  Well, this, this gentleman and I became great friends by the time I left, and I was fully in his confidence in doing my job.  It did not come without a few raised voice matches, which I did not--hoped, hoped I hadn't--would not get involved in.  But I just lost my composure a couple of times (laughter), but we ended up getting along very well.  And someone said to me, because at the end of that assignment, is when I was promoted to brigadier general.  Someone said to me, "The reason you were selected was because General John Hill said you were good, and he didn't say that about anybody" (laughter).  Which was--you paid quite a price to deal with him because he was a tough man to deal with.
Speaker 2: Well, to earn that kind of accolade I guess yeah, or to earn that kind of praise, you really--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: This John Hill was a tough guy--(unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yes, he was a tough man.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: And is a legend, even to today, among older people who knew him.
Story_ID: 674166
Speaker 1: So now, you were appointed brigadier general in '78 [1978]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the summer of 1978, I was selected in, in--I was selected in the winter, and got promoted in, in, on July 1st, 1978.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, at this juncture, did you--now, were you surprised?  Did you have any idea that you would, you would become a general in the [U.S.] Army at the, you know?  I know when you started, you didn't think you were going to be--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: You're, you're embarrassing me--be, be the--I tell people, I've always told people, and I still tell people, one must never expect to get promoted because the higher you get, the thinner is the plucking, and having had a chance as a major general to sit on a board that picked one star generals.  And you get to see how you start the session off with about a thousand of twelve hundred records, colonels, and you cull down to about three hundred.  Now, you cull that three hundred down to about thirty.  Well, you're seeing, what you're seeing is that out of a thousand or more people, only thirty are going to get promoted.  Or, surely, these people are not ineffective.  Otherwise, they wouldn't have been, wouldn't be on duty anyway, so you're picking from over a thousand effective officers, three hundred very effective officers, and then thirty of the most effective, and potential.  Officers with the most potential, so yes, you're always surprised.  But you, you can kind of watch the, the environment, and tell whether you are still in the running.  Whether you get selected or not is another matter.  In fact, while I was there at Fort Hood [Texas], there was an officer who was so confident that he was going to become a general, that he went to Korea on, on travel, and had them to make all of his general officers' uniforms.  Well, for two years in a row when he would have been eligible, he didn't get selected.  And so, I tell people, whenever you hear somebody say, "I'm up for promotion and that's--," don't say that--'cause it doesn't have to happen, and you can be fully qualified, but you're not the, the best qualified--just fully qualified.  But success breeds success, and there are many successful people in, in--and in the service, success in the service is, is a lot more identifiable than it is out in the, in civilian life because as a young officer, if you don't get certain kinds of assignments, then you're not going to go, but so far.  If you don't get to go to certain schools, you're not going to go, but so far, that you constantly are passing through gates, and they're very identifiable gates, so that when promotion time comes, the folks who are selecting get to see you in comparison with, with many others.  And, and you get to succeed or fail, based primarily on your experience, as well as how you performed in that environment.  Of course, character, and whatnot are always, always a part of this, the problem, of this, the situation.
Story_ID: 674167
Speaker 1: How would you compare [U.S.] military, the military promotional procedures to those in private life?
Speaker 2: Well, there are some industries today.  I don't know whether--what they were thirty years ago, but there, there are some industries today that, that are quite informed by record of people's success or failure.  The services have been doing that for many years.  Back in World War II [WWII] and up into Korea, and whatnot, promotions were handled significantly more decentralized.  But by the time we got to the '50s [1950s], we had begun to centralize selection for promotions and whatnot--
Speaker 1: So, just a question, so you're saying that in the past, would it be possible for a general, say, to promote another man--I mean, just raising by himself or--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --sure, earlier.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Until about when, would you say?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you, you did it, you could do back during World War II and before.  In many cases, you could do it by putting the person in the job, you know, at the, who is a lesser grade.  Now, you can say, all right, now I need to have him promoted, and so that people back in Washington [D.C.] would promote him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we went to centralized promotions and selections for assignments, and whatnot.  And it got more and more, as, as we got into the late '50s [1950s], and into the '60s [1960s] is where, where it really took off to the extent that the boards would be larger.  The people who sat on the boards were selected centrally, so that they would have a balance of combat arms people, logistics, administrative kinds of experience among the members.  They would have people from females, minorities, et cetera.  There would be representation on, on all of these, so, so that you got a much fairer look, and the board would report out its findings.  And right after it reported out its findings, a deeper investigation--what do they call it now--vetting, a deeper vetting would take place of the individuals before they would be selected.  And, to the extent that people who had problems that had not been detected, particularly all, once you got to colonel and general, they, they would--well, we'd pick out, we'd find problems with people.  And that is pertaining to private life, and not necessarily in the service, things of that nature.  But, but I would say that the military system for selections that existed from about the time I left, and I suspect up until now, and I know very little about it now, were much superior to what went on in society, and whatnot, you know, otherwise, even civilians in the service.

Speaker 1: So, in July the 1st, eight--1978, I was promoted.  By then, I wished General Shoemaker [Robert M. Shoemaker] had still been the corps commander [of the III Corps], but he wasn't.  By then, Lieutenant General Fuller [M.D. Fuller] was the, was the corps commander.  And I'll just say--he and I did not get along very well (laughter).  I'll just leave it with that.  My wife [Naomi Lewis Brooks] and children had a wonderful time also in Texas.  I, I had a wonderful time everywhere I went--I did.  I am not a person, a person hard to, to find fun or, or to find, to find pleasure because I don't, don't seek a lot of things.  But my, my daughter [Marquita Brooks] rode horses there.  In fact, General Shoemaker's wife [Tuke Shoemaker]--the day that I took over my command there, Mrs. Shoemaker came through the line.  And I had my daughter, who at the time, was about thirteen, was down on the, on the end of the line.  I can remember--well, maybe she was about twelve.  And Mrs. Shoemaker said, "What are you doing this afternoon?"  My daughter looked at me and says, "I don't--," and over at me and her mother--I said, "You're not doing anything."  She says, "I want you to go home and put on your jeans, and I'll come by and pick you up at such and such time."  So, Mrs. Shoemaker, who had a farm down there, she had horses and et cetera, came by and picked her up in a pickup truck, and took her to that farm.  And one day, one afternoon, taught her to ride a horse, and brought her home about six o'clock at night, filthy dirty (laughter) and said, "This is the toughest kid I've ever taught."  She said, "She fell off the horse three times, and was willing to get back on" (laughter).  But, those, those are the kind of, kind of events that took place in our lives, in our lives down there, so it made it for, made a wonderful ex- a wonderful experience.

Speaker 1: Upon leaving Fort Hood [Texas], and being selected for brigadier general ended my, therefore, my second consecutive command.  For a logistics officer, that is most uncommon.  It was in those days anyway.  Well, now as a brigadier general, I'm going to another command, so that's my third successive--command in succession.  And to be brutally honest after that time, more than twenty years of service, that was probably the command I, on the job, I liked the least.
Speaker 2: The job in--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in, in--
Speaker 1: There, I was--
Speaker 2: --Virginia at, at Fort Lee (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --there I was.  At Fort Lee I was commander of what was, and then called, the Troops Support Agency [Defense Commissary Agency].  And its job was to operate one hundred and eighty some commissaries around the world to control and manage the clothing and textile systems within the [U.S.] Army.  In other words, if we want to change a uniform, my office handled all of that process for the Army.  If we want to change the, the menu in the dining facilities, my, my operation handled that, and with several things of that nature.  Food and textiles was primarily what we were involved in.  And I, I say, it was not my favorite, most favorite assignment because if I had, if I had to define myself, I would say I am a troop soldier.  You know, I would much rather be with soldiers than, than doing anything else.  I consider myself a natural commander, and I loved that everywhere I went, never was afraid of it, and I always enjoyed it.  I, I used to tell young officers who worked for me, "If you're afraid of your soldiers, you'll fail and I'll know it, and so will they."  But so, I traveled all the time.  I, you know, I would get in--I had a, an airplane from a pool, a dedicated pool of small planes, and leave my station there in Petersburg [Virginia] on, like, say seven o'clock on a Monday morning, fly down to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, now at Fayetteville [North Carolina].  See that commissary, visit the commander, may go to one unit or so, and by one o'clock or two o'clock in the afternoon, leave there, and fly down to Augusta, Georgia, and look at the troops at Fort Gordon [Georgia], and go into a dining facility, and look at the commissary, and see the commander, and then get in an airplane about four o'clock, fly someplace else, have dinner there with the commander, get up in the middle, middle of the night, and go visit the commissary.  So, I just did that over, and over again.  And then I had--over a hundred of them were outside of the United States, mostly in Germany, but I had units in Alaska, Korea, Japan, the Philippines, you know, Hawai- Hawaii, Hawaii, et cetera, as well as Saudi Arabia, Italy, and, and so they kept, kept me going much more than I liked.  But, of course, we survived it.
Story_ID: 674170
Speaker 1: The commissary business in those day had just gone through a revolution.  The post commander at the several posts around the [U.S.] Army were responsible for operating their own commissary.  In about 1973 or '4 [1974], a decision was made, and then they began a process of converting them over to being the responsibility of a centralized organization, which was that Troop Support Agency [Defense Commissary Agency].  Well, posts had neglected, most posts had, had neglected those buildings, the equipment, and whatnot, and they were mostly in terrible shape.  But immediately upon turning them over to the Troop Support Agency, "Well then how come my commissary is so bad?  How come it's so cold in here?"  Well, a lot of things were--'cause one, they neglected investing in them and, two, to get a job on a post as a civilian, you, you are put in a competitive pool from which someone is selected.  Well, to work in the commissary, that competitive pool was supply clerk or supply specialist.  Well, you could be working down in the motor pool on the post as a supply clerk, or you could fit in that pool, too, so you could get hired into the commissary with absolutely no experience whatsoever.  And that went all the way up the line, too, to the commissary officer.  So, you didn't have merchandising experience.  You didn't have managerial experience, didn't have any of that, didn't know the territory as it were.  So, it made it very difficult to, to have an effective store.  I remember as a second lieutenant in Alaska--a first lieutenant in Alaska, I went into a commissary, and there was a sign on the conveyer that said, place items on conveyer in following order--canned food, so and so, and so and so.  I thought to myself, who would have the nerve to be so impersonal, you know?  That's not merchandising, you know.  I said I'll never let that happen if I ever got, get the chance.  I didn't expect to be the commissary, to be a commissary officer, or run the commissaries but I figured one day, I might be the commander who could, who could change that.  But it was those kinds of attitudes that people were dealing with so we had, had that entire culture to change.  There was no automation in the system at the time.  And I got the responsibility of initiating the program that brought in a Computerized Management System.  You've got bills coming every day because you have the bread man who comes to the store.  You have the milkman.  You have health and beauty, beauty aids people bringing products in, and you've got all these bills to pay, and, and to keep up with, keep up with all that at a store is a pretty tough job.  So, we instituted the system.  It took longer than, than my tour to, to get it done, but I got it started.  So, that, that I consider the major, my major accomplishment.  Commissaries are built with money--a surcharge that when people shop in a commissary, military commissary, a percentage, in those days, it was 4 percent.  I don't know what it is today--was, was added on to the, to the, your bill to, for modernization and maintenance of the system.  That does not come from appropriated money.  Appropriated fund money pays for the salaries of the employees, but the food and the, and the maintenance of the building are paid for by the patrons.  So, we raised enough money through that system to begin a long range plan to replace these old commissaries.  And more than, more than, thirt- let's see, thirteen were replaced or, or started the replacement while I was there.  And many, almost of all, the old ones have been replaced in the, in recent, recent years.  But after three years of that, I had, had enough.
Story_ID: 674171
Speaker 1: The [U.S.] Army then decided that I should then go to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], where I now am responsible for the procurement of all of the food, clothing, textile items, textile equipment, like a duffle bag, or a web belt or whatnot, helmets, uni- all uniforms, and all medicine, medical equipment, and medical supplies for all the [U.S.] Armed Forces, the VA [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs], and some other agencies.
Speaker 2: So, what year is this in Philadelphia?
Speaker 1: This is, this 1981--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --three years later.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, you're in procurement, you're handling that, and so what, so this is on a level where you were--this is more of a wholesale kind of a--(simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: Oh, very much so.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: We managed it.  We bought it that which was to be stored.  We stored it.  I had a, a factory with thirteen hundred sewing machine operators and cutters, et cetera, whatnot, pattern cutters, et cetera, working under me.  We, we let the contracts for the purchase of all of the uniforms and whatnot that we let out to private enterprise.  We supplied the, the commissaries in Europe and, and over-, and other overseas areas because they don't have access to, direct access to, to wholesale vendors as, as they were back here.  Back here, the, the wholesale vendor can just pull this truck right up to the commissary and unload it.  But overseas, they couldn't do that, so we had to order into Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, these, these items, load them in vans, pull the vans to Bayonne [New Jersey], put them on a ship, and shipped them to Europe, or wherever else.  And we did that out of Oakland [California] for, for the West Coast, which made it very difficult to, to have fresh items in, in the commissaries.  We bought some stuff, some things, produce, et cetera, locally, and then we bought a little meat in Europe, but very little in, in the Pacific.  But for the most part, we supported the stores out, out of the United States, and that was quite an operation.  When, when you are buying, let's say a shirt, a military shirt, uniform shirt, the, the bidders bid in four and five digits below the decimal.  In other words, let's say, we want to, they're going to bid to make a green shirt, a dress shirt.  They might be at fourteen dollars, six, eight, seven, five, two (laughter) behind the decimal point because it, it is so narrow, the percentage, the, the profit margin.  To get these contracts, you know, you got to do that in order to, to win them.  But we're, we had very little trouble, but there were some, some instances where people would bid at a point in which they couldn't manufacture it.  Now, we're in a fix.  We've got to go out and cancel the, the offer, the invitation, and start again because if, if you kick out the, the winner because of, of not being in, you don't believe he's able to produce it.  Now, you've got the problem of, of him protesting so, and that could last for as much as two years.  So, to keep the products moving, you got to go start a new, a new procurement, and leave that one hanging until it's, it's resolved.  But, it was quite an interesting assignment.
Story_ID: 674172
Speaker 1: There, I got saddled with two more major automation installations.  You know, I hear all of this ruckus about the affordable medical insurance--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --deal, but I'm telling you, having been through it five times, bringing up any kind of an operation of that nature is traumatic and it, it will take time to get it done.
Speaker 2: Okay, 'cause currently for those who are watching this at another time, the website that creates public accessibility to the Affordable Care Act [Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010] has been malfunctioning, has a lot of glitches, right? And they're currently trying to fix that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: So, so you're dealing with another big computerized system.
Speaker 1: Yeah, one of the problems, one of the problems that you have is (laughter), we have contracting practices that require low bidders.  That's what I had when I attempted the first--attempted automating the commissary system was, was--the low bidder came and started his work.  And they, they showed me the first--they put on a demonstration for me, and it's his first example of how he, how this is, was going to work.  I left the room and said, "This is a total waste of time.  We got to get somebody's--a much better contractor than this."  Well, it takes another year or two to get that resolved, to get, get to it.  We used combinations of bidders, contracting officers, contractors, and what-not.  And so, it's very difficult under our procurement systems to get these things done.  If you, you went to what you think is the best guy, then you'd have a hundred protests, and you'd have the--the political pressures from other areas would, would get involved and what-not, so you'd have to go through this laborious process.  But we, we were attempting to do it for the purchase of, of putting an automation system for the purchase and management of, of food items for the troops.  And we call that troop issue.  Well, if they, we had a system for shirts, and we had a system for parts, and things of that nature.  So, if somebody has a, a Jeep, and the starter goes out, he orders a starter.  If there is a starter available, it's shipped to him.  Well, what that then is referred to as there was a demand for one starter.  So, you say, all right, we know now that that we need to remake so many more starters.  But if you order string beans in, in the number ten can, and we don't have string beans in a number 10 can, and we give them to you in a 303 or some other kind of can, you still got the string beans.  Well, is there a demand there for string beans in a number 10 can, or 303 can (laughter)?  And so, you've got to have a different kind of system.  If you ask for string beans, and there are no string beans, and we give you mashed potatoes, do you record a demand for mashed potatoes, or do you record a demand for string beans?  Well, that sounds like a simple matter, but it required a totally different kind of demand management system, and I got stuck right in the middle of trying to get that off the ground, which I found to be a quite rewarding experience.  We had several of those kinds of experiences.
Story_ID: 674173
Speaker 1: Let me go back just a moment.  When I went to Sacramento [Sacramento Army Depot, Sacramento, California], they had just completed in, in May--I got there in July--they'd just completed in May, the installation of two CDC [Control Data Corporation] five thousand--6000 computers [CDC 6000].  It took a building bigger than a gymnasium to house the two computers, all of the ancillary equipment, tape drives and libraries, et cetera.  Today, the watch or the telephone in your pocket will do almost what one of those would do, except the printing part, all right. It had not gotten off of the ground well.  So, when I got there in July, there are twenty-five people.  I'm just exaggerating.  There are people looking over your shoulders to, "Why it failed, why is it not working?"  So, had to go through that with, with the computer system there.  We got it to run it right, took us about six months to get it done well, get it to, to performing like it was supposed to.  So, I've had a career of walking into troubled installations (laughter), of, of automation systems, but in every case, we finally got them, got them up and running.  So--
Speaker 2: And, and you worked right up until the, I guess, the technological revolution in terms of computers, and I mean, desktop computers and that sort of thing, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, see, we were going through it.  And by the, when we get to my experience in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], that's the beginning of PCs [personal computer].  Before that, it was large machines that, that you're attempt- attempting to, to use with no, no desktop--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --support.  Every- all the, everything, everybody has delivered each morning a big stack of paper with, you know, printouts, did work the printout.  You put those back, mark those up.  They go back to somebody who keypunches new cards.  And that night, they go into the machine, so you're dealing on daily with batch process.  Of course, all of that's gone, and we're complicated and, and complexed, I guess, you'd say, that the situation significantly now.  But that experience also gave me a great opportunity to deal with some tough logistics problems.
Story_ID: 674174
Speaker 1: I was also significantly involved in the community, as I seem to have gotten in most places, not so much when I was at Fort Lee [Virginia] because I was gone all the time.  But in the other three, significantly, but, but there in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], I was on the Boy Scout [Boy Scouts of America] board.  I was president of the Federal Executives Association [Philadelphia Federal Executives Association].  That's the, the informal league of, of federal agencies.  That includes the post office [U.S. Postal Service], the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], the Secret Service, Social Security [U.S. Social Security Administration], et cetera and et cetera, which brought quite a bit of exposure, and, and work, I should say.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So, is this, so as you go towards retirement, you're fairly well ensconced in the community of Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Yes.  And that's what got me out.  I, I got to Philadelphia in the summer of, of 1981.  In the summer of 1982, I was promoted to major general, two stars.  When Wilson Goode [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. W. Wilson Goode, Sr.] was elected mayor, having met many of these people in my community outreach, my name came up as a candidate for managing director.  That's equivalent to city manager.  The--I was called in, invited in for an interview, and was selected in January--in December, I guess it was, 1983.  Well, I asked the [U.S.] Army--I, I called down to the chief of staff and said, "Listen, I, I've been invited to get out, and come be the managing director of the City of Philadelphia.  Is it possible that I can hold my grade," and because you have to have three years in grade.  If under certain circumstances, it would benefit, you know, the, the services, which that would certainly have benefitted the service to have, to let, release me, you know.  "Can, can I do that?"  Well, General Schiermeier [ph.] said, "Absolutely, we will put, put it in that way."  Well, it had to go to OSD.  And when it got to OSD, Office of the Secretary of Defense, that is, it lay there until way up into January (laughter).  Well, I'm antsy now because he--they need to announce this.  So, I went on, and said, "Well, I'm going to--I'm going out, but what my grade determination is, hadn't been decided," so I said, "we'll go ahead and let it go."  And so, I, I just said, go ahead and announce it.  Well, about a week after they announced it in January, out comes the decision from the secretary of the defense's office--said, "No, you've got to go back a grade."  So, I ended up retiring as a brigadier general, rather than as a major general.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then I went, then I retired in January, and went right, went right to work.
Speaker 2: This is January of '85 [1985]?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.  And my, my junior council (laughter) (unclear) into the law, and found a law that says, you can't be a city employee in, in Philadelphia, and also be an active duty military person.  So, I had to, when I retired, I had over almost five weeks' worth of leave stored up, that I had hoped to take that leave because you're better off to be paid, while on leave, than you ought to draw the leave money.  So, I had to, I had to draw the leave money, as it were, and go ahead and retire, and go ahead and retire.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But then, I would--did that for, for two years, for almost two years.
Story_ID: 674175
Speaker 1: Your function as city manager, we were saying off camera that Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] has a strong mayor form of government, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, and Wilson Goode [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. W. Wilson Goode, Sr.] was in that position--(simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: Yes, the, the managing director controls the ten service departments of the city, which includes public property, licensing, and inspections, health, human services, water, streets, fire, police, etcetera and, and the records.  And, as such, their budgets are through you and, and their supervision comes from you.  So what the city manager does, what I did was attempt to, to gain some influence into how they managed their, their resources, which is, which is probably the greatest problem that a city has.  You're dealing with entrenched practices which, most of the time, are very wasteful and to, to manipulate that is not an easy task.  Of course, I learned when I was in graduate school at George Washington University [Washington, D.C.] that a--the effective way of management, the most effective tool that a senior manager is through dollars.  Okay?  Now, you squeeze the dollars, or you move the dollars, and you can force people to have behavior that, that accompanies that.  So, that, that's where you spend most of your time, but you, but as a city manager, you get into a lot of things that are disruptive to your time.  I, I developed a practice because everybody wants to see you.  And what's on everybody's mind is money (laughter).  So, I was finding myself sitting at my desk at seven--eight o'clock at night trying to clean up my paper, and at six o'clock in the morning trying to clean up all of the stuff I had to read and deal with because I was in meetings all day.  So, I said, I know how to handle this.  When all of these advocacy groups, et cetera, want to see me, I would, I told my administrative assistants, schedule these folks for, start the first one at 6:00, and then schedule one at 6:30, and another one at 7:00 at night.  Well, all of a sudden, the number of people who needed to see me started to decline (laughter).
Speaker 1: 'Cause that was on their time, right?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  If I've got to work, they can work, so I'm going to do my paperwork in, in my, during the day, and I'll see them in the evenings.  Well, it declined.  I was not what would one call, let, let's say, let's say what I was, rather than what I wasn't.  I was committed to not waste money.  I was committed to that, as best I could.  One day, a group wanted to see me and my--they put them in my conference room.  And I walked in and I walked around the table, shook everybody's hand, and sat down.  And the lady at the, to, to my immediate right, says, "Before we start this meeting, let me make one thing clear.  My health is my right."  Well, I made the mistake of saying, "Whose right is it to pay for it?"  So, the meeting went downhill from there but, you know, while people have rights, all rights have to be paid for.  And when there is a bottom to the bucket, and there's nothing else to pour out, something has to give.  And, of course, that's what our, our entire society operates in that environment.  Well, that became, that's one example of, of the kind of thing that you are constantly involved in.  Someone came to visit me once and asked, "How do you like what you're doing?"  I said, "I could not have gone to the JFK School of Government at Harvard [John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and learned in five years what I've learned here in six months."  The combination of the several influences that include unions, desires of the people, and they're very close.  You know, that's really local politics and the people are right there.  And, and their competing desires make that a, made that a very difficult job that required quite a bit of, of--what should I say--management by juggling to get it done.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: But I enjoyed that, I really enjoyed it.
Story_ID: 674176
Speaker 1: Wilson Goode [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. W. Wilson Goode, Sr.], the first black mayor of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] elected in what--'83 [1983], '84 [1984]?
Speaker 2: He, he came in, in January of '84 [1984].
Speaker 1: Okay, January of '84 [1984].  Chicago [Illinois] had just elected its first black mayor in '83 [1983], Harold Washington.  Detroit [Michigan] had a black mayor [Coleman Young].  So, what was your, so, was your relationship with Wilson Goode a good one?
Speaker 2: Well, we were, you know, we were on a first name basis, but our management styles were very different.
Speaker 1: Now, did he select you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  Our management styles were very different.  He had, he had, had the job just before me, but we would, we, we met several times during the week, during the week, you know, for various and sundry purposes.  But I had a, a friend who had been a college mate of mine.  The city had six commissioners, a six--not commissioners--six senior players.
Speaker 1: Cabinet members or--
Speaker 2: Cabinet, in the cabinet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One of them was the finance, director of finance.  His name was Richard Gilmore, who had been a college mate of mine who, I today, think had some influence on getting Wilson Goode to come look for me, who had been a senior vice president in a couple of banks, different, the larger banks there in Philadelphia, had worked for (unclear) and somebody else, you know, what-not, and had a full business, high-level business experience there in the city.  But, and while he was my personal friend, he and I had to always battle over money.  I'm needing more--he's finding less (laughter).  The way Philadelphia is organized, the tax collector is outside of the government, outside of the cabinet.  The controller is outside, but the solicitor, the finance director, who handles basically the, the finance, the, the expenditure side of, of the budget for the city, you know, we're, we're part of the cabinet.
Story_ID: 674177
Speaker 1: My job was to deal with, with the unions, and deal with the management organizations.  I enjoyed getting up at five o'clock in the morning, and going down and watching the dispatch of the trash trucks, or going at ten o'clock at night, and seeing the police going to a precinct, and watch the police make arrests and whatnot.  Any time a fireman, or a policeman, or any other city employee was shot, anything of that nature, you were there.  I don't care what time of night it was.  Anything from a five alarm fire up, you're there, so it was quite a demanding job.  I bought a house in the City of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], so that I could live right downtown.  And I used to jog the street oft-times about six o'clock in the morning.  And so, in, in that city, you get security, so there I would go with my security.  I was doing what I used to call police call.  We would go down, go down to Main [Street], run down to Main, downtown Philadelphia to see whether the streets had been cleaned up the night before and whatnot from, from the evening's hoopla.  But it was, it was a tremendous experience dealing with licensing matters, health matters, etcetera, yeah, as well as human services matters, all the, all the folk who are homeless--that Sunday, you, the, all the housing projects, whatnot.  On the Saturdays, we would go, and go out into neighborhoods and just go, go visit housing projects.  And one of the, one of the sad commentaries would be, I was in a housing project one weekend when they--it was the cleanup weekend.  And the housing, the director of that particular development says, "I'm going to take you around here to Mrs. So and So's house."  So, we went to see Mrs. So and So's house, and she let us in, gave us a glass of Kool-Aid or something.  It was on a hot day, Saturday morning.  And then, we went out and we, we went to another house not half a block away.  She says, "Now this is the daughter of Mrs. So and So back there."  And we go further, "Now this is the granddaughter of Mrs. So and So."  So, there's three generations caught up in public housing.  But all of that was a part of my responsibility and, and which made for a wonderful, wonderful experience, but very, very physically and psychologically demanding.
Story_ID: 674178
Speaker 1: One of the--well, I guess this is a kind of a low life of the City of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] is the MOVE crisis of 1985.  And so, can, I don't know what you want to say about it 'cause you said it's still litigation around that and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That got, that got started as a, what I call a push-push situation where one, one individual would push, and the community, or the government, or the people would kind of get out of the way.  So, they'd push it a little further, and they just push it a little further.  And it just came pushing until it got to the escalations that it had several years before and, and then you had this second escalation.  But as the city managing director, my job there and my only job there, was to coordinate the activities of the fire department, the police department, the health department was out there, water because a lot of water was being, being consumed.  And human services because we had to, we knew, at some point, we'd have to house the family or something, so that was really what my role was there.
Speaker 1: Well, let me just say that for those who are watching that don't know what we're talking about.  Let's see if I can summarize it, and correct me if I'm wrong.  The MOVE organization was sort of an unusual organization of individuals, they're living in a house, in a row house in Philadelphia in the--was that the north side of Philadelphia or, or the--
Speaker 2: No, it was in West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: West Philadelphia okay.  And they had, they believed in some sort of a natural way of life, where some didn't wear clothes and then, people were, neighbors were complaining about waste, you know, in the house, in the building, noise, you know.  There's a loud speaker on the building at one point.  It escalated where the, there was a constant broadcast coming out of the building.  And the, so the neighbors really called upon the city to do something to abate the building, right.  Is that right so far?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then, and, so in an effort to do that, the City of Philadelphia met with resistance on the part of the individuals inside the building.  Some of them were armed and so, this is a crisis that the city faced and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's what, that's what brought that to a head.
Speaker 1: And the resulting actions by the city--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Didn't turn out, didn't turn out like it was hoped it would have.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: It was just, you know, some failures as the records there that didn't show, you know, didn't, just didn't, things didn't occur so that, that was a result.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  The mayor [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. W. Wilson Goode, Sr.], we interviewed him, said he didn't know what was going on.  He said, he didn't know.  And the--
Speaker 2: Well, he knew (laughter) because I told him--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --what was going to happen.
Story_ID: 674179
Speaker 1: Back into January before that, I had visited my parents.  And my sister who, at the time, was assistant, an assistant superintendent of schools down here in Northern Virginia, said, "Dad [Houston Brooks, Sr.] has prostate cancer."  So, I said, "Well, you're still working.  I've got one retirement.  I can manage.  I'll come home."  So, I went back in January, and I told Wilson Goode [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. W. Wilson Goode, Sr.], "I'm leaving in March."  He said, "Please don't leave in March--wait 'til June or July."  I said, "All right, I'll do that."  So, my departure from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] was purely at my own discretion.  I had a four year contract, which was good, unless there was some sort of malfeasance or whatnot, and some kind of misconduct or whatnot, was good for two and a half more years.  So, I didn't leave under any kind of pressure, other than to go take care of my father, and that record is abundantly clear.  Now, he denied it.  He ignored that in his public statements, but that's life.
Speaker 2: Okay, so--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, but then, when we left Philadelphia, I went back to take care of my father, who had to have a hip replaced, and never really recovered from it.  He ended up with a blood sugar diabetes, diabetes in such a, to such an extent that we couldn't get it balanced, so he, he couldn't walk.  So, we had to put--after, after we put him in the hospital to have his hip replaced, he came home.  And they sent a nurse, a male nurse to the house to take care of him, to for--well, after the man left the first time, my mother [Evelyn Lemon Brooks] looked at me and said, "That man is not coming in my house again."  I said, "Why?"  She said, "I don't want him in this house."  Well, my mother had been a very protective woman over the years because my father was a minister.  And in order to keep all of the in- invasions into your life by parishioners and community and whatnot, to keep it out of the personal life, she maintained that wall for her family.  And I suspect it had to do with the instinct, for instincts from that.  She didn't (unclear).  What that meant, I then became the nurse.  So, for almost eighteen months, I went to that house every day, except Sunday.  And my sister would do it on Sundays, would go home Sundays.  And I would bathe him, I would exercise him and whatnot, and stay there from seven o'clock in the morning until seven, eight o'clock at night.  I did that for a year and a half.  I thank God I did it.  At his, at, at the wake, just before his funeral, I was smiling, talking with someone.  And one of his former deacons said, "How can you smile at a time like this?"  I said, "I did everything that was humanly possible for him.  You know, I can smile."
Story_ID: 674180
Speaker 1: And so, my father [Houston Brooks, Sr.], after he, he died, I started to consulting, and work was coming faster than I could handle it.  I had an oil, a, a, an oil company, a middle man company in Texas who was attempting to get into selling oil to--fuel, fuel to the government who needed, wanted me to help them develop his plans, et cetera, et cetera.  So, I would fly to Las Gallinas, Texas, which is east of Dallas [Texas], and work with him.  And one morning at about five o'clock, I was leaving the house.  And my wife [Naomi Lewis Brooks] got up, and I had a taxi cab out there waiting for me, and I said, "Gee, this is like old times."  She, she said, "I thought you would never get the message." And said no more.  So, I went out and got in the cab, and went to Texas, and I thought it while on the airplane, what on earth is she telling me?  And I decided I'd quit.  So, I told the guy that I'm not coming back.  He said, "Okay, I'll double your fee."  I said, "No, that's not it."  He--I finally gave it up.  And we went and bought a thirty-four foot motor home.
Speaker 2: Now, wait a minute--this means, you really retired, right?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You bet--and began to see the world, the United States, anyway.  So, we go to Florida for a month or two in the winter, and go to Mich- upper Michigan, and to Minnesota, and to Cape Cod [Massachusetts], and all, and various sundry places, and, and spent quite a bit of time in it.  And then, my mother [Evelyn Lemon Brooks], by then, is in her nineties, became difficult to deal with, began to develop dementia.  And I couldn't leave that on my sister.  Just she, she and I were the only two living in the area--I couldn't leave that on her.  So, I began to slow down and one, one year, I only was out four nights out of the whole year.  Well, that's much too much money to let sit for, to, you know, for, you know, for to get four nights out of here in it.  So, I sold it, and got out of that business.  Well, my mother made it to 101.  And for the last four years of her life, every day, seven days a week, at noon and at supper time, I or my wife, or my sister was there in the nursing home.  And I would say to anybody, the most successful experiences in a nursing home are those which are carefully watched and visited by the family.  My mother was taken care of better than we could take of her at home.  My sister didn't want to put her in the nursing home.  She said, "She'll fall, and break her hip."  Well, she fell it and broke it at home, and that's why we had to finally put her in a nursing home at ninety-seven.  Well, she made it to 101 and one month, and had no pains, blood pressure better than mine, but the dementia had gotten to her, and she just wore out.
Story_ID: 674181
Speaker 1: While in retirement, I worked on a lot of angles in the community.  I was first a deacon in my church where I just became emeritus about three years ago.
Speaker 2: What's the name of your church?
Speaker 1: Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria [Virginia], and I was an adult Sunday school teacher there.  And that's where I also got involved in--the homeless shelter was through the church.  But I was a--I started off just as working at the polls one year.  So, they said, "Oh, listen, we need you to be, to run, be, be the--in charge of the polls at some place."  So, I became the head of a, of a poll the next year.  So, then, they promoted me to be a supervisor, so then, I had twelve to fourteen other polls and precincts that I supervised during elections in the preparation.  Virginia didn't, it doesn't have chad.  At least, Fairfax County [Virginia] didn't have chad, like Florida, but had, they had chad.  I would have been a chad counter because we are the people who came in after the election and verified, through a canvas, the accuracy of the, the reports from the various precincts.  And I did that for more than twenty--I think twenty-three years.
Speaker 2: The chads are the holes, the perforated holes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's, that's right.  You know, in Florida, they used a punch card.  And if the, if the, if you punched it, and the little piece didn't fall out, it might close back down, and the reader wouldn't pick it up.
Speaker 2: That was the hanging chad--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Hanging chad, that's where that came from, yeah.  But we didn't have, didn't have that in, in new Fairfax County, but we, but so, but you had to prepare the machines, and then read out and manage the, the results.  The other thing I did was I became involved with the American Bar Association and, even today, I'm a member of the American Bar Association council on the accreditation of law schools [Accreditation Committee].  Their, their system, as a result of a court decree several years ago, they are required to have a minimum of three non lawyers on their council.  Today, they have a college president from California.  They have a CPA [certified public accountant] from Baltimore [Maryland], and me as, as members of that council.  And we adjudicate decisions made by an accreditation committee on actions for law schools if they want to change their curriculum, if they want to change their locations.  And then, they get, every seven or eight years, they get a visit to make sure what they're doing is in compliance with the rules, so, and then, we adjudicate their results of those.  And, and now I sit in full retirement with two sons [HistoryMaker Brigadier General Leo Brooks, Jr. and HistoryMaker General Vincent Brooks] and a daughter [Marquita Brooks], and four grandchildren, and one and a half, or one and one on the way, great-grandchildren--child.
Story_ID: 674182
Speaker 1: Now, tell us something about your family.  I know you have two celebrated sons, but you have a daughter [Marquita Brooks], too, and you mentioned that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, my daughter is, my daughter is an attorney in Washington, D.C.  I think I mentioned, way back in this interview, when she was in high school, high school.  And a low expectation teacher, a guidance counselor, said she wasn't college material, and wanted to put her in a class called math for living.  I said, "No, she's going to take algebra."  Well, she took algebra--she passed algebra.  She's now a law school graduate.  I simply say that to let you know that if a parent doesn't have expectations and leads the family, the family doesn't get led, but so, she's a successful attorney now.  My two sons--one is, is retired.  He retired as a brigadier general and is now a--
Speaker 1: That's Vincent, Jr. [HistoryMaker General Vincent Brooks]?
Speaker 2: No, this is Leo [HistoryMaker Brigadier General Leo Brooks, Jr.].
Speaker 1: No, no, I'm sorry, Leo, Jr., right.
Speaker 2: This is the oldest one, and he's now senior vice president, corporate vice president of a major aircraft corporation.  And the other son is an active duty four star general right now, and the commander of U.S. Army Pacific, having prior to that, served as commander of the Third Army [U.S. Army Central], which had been Patton's [George S. Patton] during World War II [WWII].
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a--
Speaker 2: And then before that, he commanded the, the 1st Infantry Division whose headquarters are at Fort Riley [Kansas].  He took it to, to Iraq.  And, of course, before that, he had been assistant division commander of the 1st Calvary Division at Fort Hood [Texas], and went with it to Iraq, yeah, yeah.  Both of the sons are military academy graduates who decided to stay in, in the service, yeah.
Story_ID: 674183
Speaker 1: It's unusual for sons to follow directly in their father's footsteps, especially in the, in the occupation that you have excelled in--that, that being in the [U.S.] military as generals.  So, I think, aren't you the only African American at this point whose sons are--followed you as generals--(simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: It, it is, it is very common among Caucasians.  It's, it's quite common, three and sometimes as many as four generations, and to have multiple children to be academy graduates, and to rise to the rank of general, and whatnot.  It has never happened before for African Americans--it has never.  So, when our two sons [HistoryMaker Brigadier General Leo Brooks, Jr. and HistoryMaker General Vincent Brook]--and I say ours because they're my wife's [Naomi Lewis Brooks] as much as they are mine--our two sons, you know, succeeded in, in reaching that rank while we were very happy.  We're also sad that it's taken this long for it to happen in America.
Story_ID: 674184
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there anything major that you would do differently if you could go back and change it?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) In life or in the [U.S. military] service?
Speaker 1: Well, in your career and the service, I guess?
Speaker 2: There are some other assignments I might liked to have had, but using Booker T. Washington's expression, "Drop your buckets where you are," you, you take the cards you're dealt, and you try to play the hand, and best you can.  And so, I, I just leave to the providence of God and the fortuity of life that, you know, the circumstances that came my way did.  The good, the bad, the painful, as well as the joyful, my life, 'til now--and while I don't want to sound like it's, this is my obituary--has been wonderful.  And I just thank God that I was able to get to where I got for a little boy off of Elbert Avenue in Alexandria, Virginia, who couldn't go to school in his own neighborhood, who was one of five children.  God's been very good to me, and, and to which I'm life--if there's anything that I might have done that I didn't do, I might have been a minister.  There were times in my life when that urge rose.  Circumstances at the time didn't match as far as I thought, so I didn't do it, but I might have done that.  If you asked me in life, what would I like to have been able to do that I never, that I wasn't able to do, there are two things.  I would have loved to have been a master organist and, secondly, I would have loved to have worked in an old fashioned hardware store.  I dearly love, and when we travel, particularly when we had the RV [recreational vehicle], we'd go through towns.  I'd always get to go see the old hardware store if they, if they had one, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's interesting 'cause I was going to ask you like, what you got out of the travel, you know, after travelling all over America.  Well, that's interesting.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, yeah.  Well, of course, we carried, we carried golf clubs, fishing tackle, and whatnot in the, in the belly of the RV, so that we were always ready wherever we went.
Story_ID: 674185
Speaker 1: Now, we always ask this question.  What, today, then, looking back at your career again, would you consider to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2: My what?
Speaker 1: Professional legacy, your legacy in--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, legacy, legacy (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I would like to think that there are hundreds of young people whose lives have been changed because they listened a little bit to what I had to tell them.  I guess I'm bragging when I say in the church that I'm in [Alfred Street Baptist Church, Alexandria, Virginia], there are at least ten deacons who, to some degree, got there because of my leadership, and their listening--not string pulling, but listening to the extent that they followed some practices of mine and, therefore, I was able to recommend them.  I spent a lot of time advising people about, you know, how to succeed by work, not by association, but by work.  And there are people who constantly contact my--or run into my children (laughter), who recall instances (laughter), in which I had influence in somebody's life.  One man tells the story of how he was a captain when I was a brigadier general.  And he, he was a minority, and was concerned about how they had changed his assignment.  And he sought me out, got permission to come to see, to my office to see me, and laid it all on the line.  And he says, "And your answer was, 'Shut up and go back to work'" (laughter).  And that's really what it was.  And he had a good assignment.  You take the cards you're dealt, and you play them the best you can.  I did that--that's been my theme to life.  My son put in his high school yearbook, "If the world gives you lemons, make lemonade."  Well, and, and that's kind of what I tried to, to teach people, you know.  "That's all right.  They mistreated you.  What they meant for evil, you use for good."  And, and it works.  So, I, so, if there is a legacy, it's my influence upon so many, many young people.
Story_ID: 674186
Speaker 1: Likewise, we always ask this question, too.  What are some are your hopes and concerns for the Black community today?
Speaker 2: I have always felt and I feel it stronger today than ever, that our exit from the various travails will only come from our own exasperation with contentment among our- among ourselves, meaning we have to, or we will, make advances based on our fight, even more so than our politics.  Money is good, and money is necessary.  Support is important.  (Unclear) are important.  But to break the chains of poverty, the chains of crime, the train--chains of health, and, and, and the other things that pull us down, will come most out of individual efforts, as opposed to out of programs.  Yes, the program is important, they're there, but you don't come out of it because the program is there.  You come out of it because you want out, and you have to, to dig to get out.  There just too many examples, and we could sit here for three days, giving you examples of people who grew out the vicissitudes of their lives by their own tenacity.
Story_ID: 674187
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything I haven't asked you that we need to address before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: You didn't ask me whether I loved my wife or not.
Speaker 1: Well, all right (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I do, very much, we've been married next--in two weeks, it will be fifty-eight years.  And, we've known each other since children.  Our parents have known each other, or knew each other, since we were, were children.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well congrat--
Speaker 2: What's your last question?
Speaker 1: --congratulations.  I think we got the courtship, at least in the beginning, and some of the early years.
Story_ID: 674188
Speaker 1: But the, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERUPTION)
Speaker 1: I would like to be remembered as a person who lived a life, shedding pieces of it into other people.  I, I am not concerned about being remembered for accomplishments, but for service.  My family was service oriented--meaning to others.  As a boy, I saw my father [Houston Brooks, Sr.] bring people off of the road during the Depression [Great Depression] to our house.  He'd pick them up, hitchhikers, families, and my mother [Evelyn Lemon Brooks] would feed them, before we'd put them back on the road.  I've seen, I've had so many examples of how to be a giver that, that's what I consider to be the legacy I would like.  My father had an expression, "I will help you if you let me."  I never used that expression, but that's really been the, the premise of my life, and that's really what, what I'd like to see folks remember, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, well, thank you very much.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: All right.
