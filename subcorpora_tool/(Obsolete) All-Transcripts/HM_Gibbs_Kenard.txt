Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Sure.  My mother's full name is Annette Ames, A-M-E-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Ames is her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Ames is her maiden name, correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born September 7th, 1936 in Columbus, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Hinds County.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What do you know about her side of the family and how far back first of all can you trace that side of the family?
Speaker 2: I can trace that side of the family back to my great grandmother which takes us probably about as far back as I can go.  I mean I know of names of I think even her mother but after that I don't have any--no, no recollection of it or it's never really been discussed because like a lot of families in the South they lived in the country on what was a plantation.  And the records weren't very well kept and the families tended to disperse.  And most family history was pretty much, you know, relegated to word of mouth, so yeah.
Speaker 1: As far as you know did your ancestors come from the same area of Mississippi?
Speaker 2: On my mother's side, yes.  On my mother's side, yes.  Now you know there's folklore as to you know the, the discussion of my grand--my grandmother's mother you know having children by the, the owner of the, the plantation that they, they lived on.  So you know I've heard family folklore you know as to what those folks look like and--.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any story--well yeah tell us what they looked like.  Tell us about the folklore.
Speaker 2: Well they were, they were mulatto children you know and that's, that's basically it.  It was pretty well know.  They were afforded you know certain privileges because of their you know mulatto heritage that probably other folks on that particular parcel of land, they all lived together, may not have had you know.  So but that I don't think is that atypical in a lot of areas in the South.
Speaker 1: Right. You're Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you know the name of the plantation owners or the--?
Speaker 2: You know I did and I've since forgotten.  But it wasn't anything grandiose you know.  It was somebody's place, so and so's place you know that owned a large parcel of land.  You know I had been told that during the Civil War, times prior to the Civil War it was a full functioning plantation.  But once the Civil War occurred that the people who lived on that that plantation and were slaves you know opted to become sharecroppers which from how it's been explained to me in many ways is very akin to slavery because you would all--you could never work your debt off so to speak.  The--there was never enough crops that were pulled in to cover your debt.  So you have, you know, full generations of people that never left that particular plantation although they were not in bondage.  But many of them did not opt to really leave you know that land.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know the--so you can trace it back to your great grandmother?
Speaker 2: My great grandmother and actually probably even further back than that.  I'm just thinking,  I mean I, I did a project, helped my daughter [Taylor] with a project actually that she had to do for school and I talked to my, excuse me, my grandmother [Costella Ames]  who is about eighty-eight years old now.  And getting her to go back she was mentioning other names of people but it was kind of unclear to me how it all kind of came together.  Unfortunately she's old in age now and a lot of the memory of it you know had to be jogged.  But she was talking about different people who were her aunts and things like that and who worked in the big house and the various jobs that some people had, this and that.
Speaker 1: So she can trace it back to at least the latter part of the nineteenth century I guess to the 1890s or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I would guess--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, even probably like 1880s, 1870s is how far she had gotten back.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did she ever talk about anybody during the Civil War period or--well I guess maybe the--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the owner, you know, of that parcel of land--,
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) The children of the owner, yeah.
Speaker 2: --the children of that owner, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.  So they--.
Speaker 1: They may go back to the Civil War then right?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Yeah, but also what she talked a lot about was--and my grandmother has features that looked very Indian.  And you know she talks an awful lot about the intermarrying of, in that particular part of Mississippi, you know.  I guess they were Africans or African Americans with the indigenous Indian population.  And you know so a number of our, we have--as a lot of folks like to say we got a lot of Indian in us. (Laughs)
Speaker 1: Yeah people say it but there's a lot of truth about that--,
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --at least in the middle of Mississippi there.  And Greenwood, Mississippi was founded by a Choctaw named Greenwood Leflore.
Speaker 2: Right, Choctaw, I've heard my uncle talk about us being of Choctaw heritage and then there's also the, there's another one Choctaw and the--.
Speaker 1: The Cherokee too in that part of--.
Speaker 2: It was Chickasaw.
Speaker 1: Chickasaw, right.
Speaker 2: Chickasaw and the Choctaw.  I've heard--tell that somehow that's the tribe that you know was indigenous to, to the area where we lived.
Speaker 1: Now where's Columbus, is that in the central part of the state or southern part or the northern part?
Speaker 2: It's, it's, it's the kind of like the mid--central eastern part.  It's not far from Alabama.  It's around Meridian [Mississippi] and Starkville [Mississippi], in that area.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And did your mother talk about growing up there?  Did she grow up there?
Speaker 2: She did grow up in Mississippi yes she did.  You know she, her family moved to, she was raised in Columbus the town of Columbus although, you know, her mother and, and her father were raised in the country and they moved in Columbus where my grandfather [Sam Ames] had a really thriving business as a barber.  He was a barber and at one time owned his own barbershop in a black part of town there in Columbus.  It was one street that was like the street where the black businesses were and he also right next door to his barbershop opened up a café.  So they were entrepreneurial, you know, working class folk who you know had very deep religious ties to the church.  My father--grandfather were, had a singing group, a gospel singing group that used to travel around to various churches in Mississippi.  And I even remember hearing him sing one time when I was a little boy on the radio.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the group?
Speaker 2: You know I, I want to say The Soul Stirrers or something like that.
Speaker 1: The Soul Stirrers are famous now.
Speaker 2: Was it The Soul Stirrers?
Speaker 1: If he was a part of The Soul Stirrers--there's a famous group called The Soul Stirrers that's really, you know--.
Speaker 2: Maybe it wasn't--maybe that just popped into my mind because--but they were, you know five men that sang a cappella gospel music and I remember when I would go visit when I was just a little boy my grandmother would, would turn on the radio and say, "That's your grandfather singing there," you know and yeah, be singing.  But they were enterprising folk.  My grandmother ran the café next door and my grandfather had the barbershop.  There were only two barbershops in town and--.
Speaker 1: What was your grandfather's name that--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Sam Ames.
Speaker 1: Sam, Sam what?
Speaker 2: Sam, Ames, A-M-E-S.
Speaker 1: Ames okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But I mean The Soul Stirrers were a really big deal.  I mean they were a big deal in black gospel music and if he was a part of that that was really--you know, that's one a lot of people have heard of.
Speaker 2: I'll have to check into that.  I just remember that it was very, very popular.  They were--.
Speaker 1: But if he was on the radio singing that was really something too.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They were both of--she was a--she is an Eastern Star and he was a Mason.  I know they were quite, I know that they're secret organizations, fraternal organizations that have very strong roots in the south and in the black community but I don't really know much more about, apart than that she always tells me.  But she was an Eastern Star, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, those affiliations were real important to creating a network amongst black folks in very small towns because they couldn't--they'd have to know who they could rely on you know to--.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: Because they traveled around.  So now did your mother have a chance to go to school there? Did they have a--?
Speaker 2: She did.  She went to high school there and then was the first in her family I believe of nine children, there were nine of them and she was the first of the nine girls to go to college.  And she went to Tougaloo College [Tougaloo, Mississippi] which is outside of Jackson, Mississippi and she went into teaching, and taught briefly after she finished college there in Columbus at the high school.  And then later migrated, moved after meeting my father [Solomon Eugene Gibbs] in college and him going into the military so it was then they moved in Chicago [Illinois] where she was a teacher as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, did she teach in grade schools in Chicago?
Speaker 2: In Chicago she taught, she started off in grade school but then went to high school and up until the time she passed she was at [Francis W.] Parker High School [Chicago, Illinois] which is now [Paul] Robeson [High School, Chicago, Illinois] and she was the assistant principal of programming by the time it all ended.
Story_ID: 7612
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how your mother [Annette Ames] and father met?
Speaker 2: They--my father was from Jackson, Mississippi and was you know a football player there at Tougaloo [College, Tougaloo, Mississippi] and captain of the football team and a Kappa [Alpha Psi].  And my mother and he met and dated throughout college and immediately upon graduating from college he was drafted into the service and they got married shortly after he was drafted.  And you know while he was away in the service in Germany she stayed in Columbus [Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's name is Solomon Eugene Gibbs.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth is December 30th, 1936, born in Jackson, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: Father's side?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Not an awful lot.  I know very little actually not, not an awful lot at all that comes quickly to memory.  Somewhere I remember writing some stuff down but not--I don't remember an awful lot.  I, I know that my grandfather was a, a minister and a preacher and I know that his father was a preacher as well in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay, what faith were they?
Speaker 2: Baptist, yeah Baptist ministers.  Now they--my father spent a lot of his time in Hazlehurst, around Hazlehurst, Mississippi out in the country because I guess that's where my grandmother--he was primarily raised not by his mother but by his grandmother because they had eleven kids.  So it was quite, you know, common for the older kids to be with the mother and father in the city and he spent a lot of his early years--I think he lived in the country up till he was like six years old and then he you know went to live with his mother and father in the city of Jackson yeah, when some of the older kids kind of moved on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But now what was your father like and what did he do for--what, well he's still alive isn't he?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: He's a retired Chicago Public School principal.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah he, he's been with the board of education for thirty seven years and retired about two years ago so he was the principal of [Ronald E.] McNair Academy [Center] on the West Side of Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So he probably went on to higher education I mean you know beyond a bachelor's I guess.
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.  He got his masters at thirty-six from DePaul University [Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 7613
Speaker 1: Tell me about growing up.  What's your first childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My first childhood memory is of our apartment where we lived, 8316 [South] Ingleside [Avenue], Chicago's [Illinois] South Side and it's of that apartment you know.  It was a one-bedroom apartment and, that I lived in until we were six, you know from the time I was born until we were six.  So I remember in detail in terms of the layout of it you know.  I remember someone broke into it when I was quite young and that was a scary kind of feeling.  We weren't home at the time but we came home and whoever had broken into it had all of our stuff lined up at the door you know.  So we actually I think we scared them when we arrived home.  And I was probably about four years old then, maybe a little bit younger but I remember a police officer coming and it was very traumatic to me at that time.
Speaker 1: So this is in Englewood [Chicago neighborhood] you said?
Speaker 2: No, 8316 Ingleside, South Ingleside.
Speaker 1: Oh Ingleside, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, between Cottage Grove [Avenue] and, on the west and what's the other major street, probably Stony Island [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Yeah they call it--.
Speaker 2: Over by Avalon Park [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Avalon Park, right..
Speaker 2: Right around the corner from Avalon Park, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's my earliest kind of childhood recollection.  I remember being in nursery school.  I remember being dropped off for that and yeah fond child memories.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: You know I can remember early on as a kid going on walks with my parents up to Cottage Grove to the pharmacy there on 83rd [Street] and Cottage Grove.  And I can remember walking to the laundromat with my mother and going to the corner grocery store and the man there Bill, it was called Bill's Grocery you know, he used to always let me, give me money or something.  He was a real nice man.  You know it was always music in my house.  My parents [Solomon Eugene Gibbs and Annette Ames] loved music.  My mother loved B.B. King, Al Green. Certain songs when I hear them bring back very vivid memories of my father playing one of those forty-fives over and over again.  (Singing) "It's a rainy night in Georgia" or 'Shotgun' you know--.
Speaker 1: Junior Walker?
Speaker 2: Junior Walker [& the All-Stars], yeah. Certain songs just bring back memories of when I was very, very small because my parents used to keep a lot of records.  They had a lot of records and I can remember those little spindle, little things you used to put into the forty-fives.  We used to always write their names on their records because they'd go to people's houses and play records and make sure that they bring their records back.  So this--it was always music you know.  And I remember also as a child since my parents came from pretty large families I always had a lot of cousins around, first cousins and second cousins.  And I remember you know getting together with them on special occasions you know Thanksgiving, Christmas.  I remember when my parents moved from this one bedroom apartment to our first house and how exciting that was and how much space we had and how you know everyone would come over to our house you know to--for the holidays, you know.  I also remember how my parents would always, you know, have their youngest siblings come stay with us after they finished school or moved up from Mississippi, you know.  There was often, you know, go stay with your older brother or your you know sister in Chicago until you get yourself together and go out and get your own apartment.  I remember my uncle staying with us, my aunt staying with us you know, any number of people that were family could stay with us for a little while until they got themselves together.  So we were kind of the, a weighing place so to speak, you know.  I remember that.
Story_ID: 7614
Speaker 1: Chicago [Illinois] is really a Mississippi city you know in a lot of ways so--.
Speaker 2: It really is.  It really is.  A lot of people have the same story of coming North and staying with family, extended family until they got themselves together.  My father [Solomon Eugene Gibbs] often told me of his story of you know coming to Chicago during summers while he was in school to work and you know at that time you know his uncle had a shoe shop out in Morgan Park [Illinois].  And you know telling me of what it--life was like in Morgan Park and how that was viewed as a very you know quasi affluent area, kind of out you know far out--well I ain't going to say quasi affluent but you know it was a, the place where people owned homes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was an independent kind of black community.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Independent, exactly.
Speaker 1: Because that's what people said in those days which is--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He would often tell me about his exploits going down on 63rd Street, 47th Street as a young man you know and how he could go to any of these clubs, bars or whatever and run into people from his hometown you know and that knew his older brother or knew him.  It seemed to be a real sense of community at that time.
Speaker 1: Right, that, that pretty much had dried up by the time you came along I guess?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, by the time I come up it was, yeah.
Speaker 1: Is--but Cottage Grove I remember in, when I was in college we used to get 'Muhammad Speaks' and some of the other, the 'Chicago Defender' and--,
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --some of the other Chicago-oriented papers and even 'Ebony' and 'Jet' and all have the Chicago flavor because--,
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --they were produced right there in town.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you've often hear about Cottage Grove as a, as a major drag, a street in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  Absolutely.
Speaker 1: The Nation of Islam's Your Supermarket was right down the street from you.
Speaker 2: It sure was right down 83rd.  I remember when they built I mean the restaurant that they had right there on 83rd and Cottage Grove.
Speaker 1: Salaam [Restaurant].
Speaker 2: Exactly Salaam, I remember seeing that.
Speaker 1: It seemed like a really thriving--in fact you were right in the heart of a real thriving black community in Chatham which was new--,
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I think, I guess when you were growing up it was fairly--,
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: --newly black.
Speaker 2: Definitely, definitely.  As a matter of fact when we moved to our first house it was a really interesting time for me because we moved into an area and I saw firsthand what a number of your urban, you know, professors talk about, white flight because the area that we moved to, the community was called Rosemoor and it was an area that was predominantly made up of immigrants.  And the grammar school that I went to was a Catholic grammar school called Our Lady of Hungary [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  And the reason it was called Our Lady of Hungary is because in that little, you know, area most of the people that lived there were Hungarian Immigrants and many of them worked at the steel mill which is right next to my school, Verson Steel was right by my school.  And I remember in second grade going to that school and being only one of maybe three you know black kids in the class.  And by the time I graduated in eighth grade the school had turned, so to speak, you know where it was probably 98 percent black.  And during that time it was real interesting to me you know how when I was a young kid you know second, third, fourth, fifth grade as the community was changing and it was changing drastically.  I mean, when we first moved in you know there were white neighbors to our left, to our right you know and it was almost as if when black people began to move into the community they would sell.  I mean they moved to Dolton [Illinois], they moved to South Holland [Illinois] you know like that was their mecca.  And it was interesting because the community, the neighborhood was in turmoil.  I used to have to walk to school and there was a viaduct on 95th Street and Woodlawn [Avenue].  And we used to have to walk under that viaduct to continue to school and when you crossed that, that viaduct we were in Burnside [Chicago neighborhood].  And you know we would often get chased home from school but we knew once we made it to that viaduct you know we were safe.  So at the time you know all the kids in my area, all the black kids we used to walk together to make it under that viaduct and, and get to school.  And then coming home you know things broke out we knew all we had to do was run.  Everybody would run to that viaduct because you know the folks wouldn't come past that viaduct.  You know basically what they were saying we're going to chase you out our neighborhood.  You know you can go to school here but as soon as school is out we chasing you home, get home.  Don't, don't loiter, don't waste any time or go to the store, the candy store, just go.  So you know unfortunately at an early age or fortunately, depending on how you want to look at it you know I had a very, very up close and personal you know look at, at racism and to know what it was like to be you know taunted and told you're not wanted there and blah, blah, blah.  So, but by the same token you know a number of the friends that I made despite all of that you know, classmates of mine you know were, were white.  And it was interesting because you know with children as a child at that age you know we were not very in tuned to the hostilities around us.  We knew that we went to school together and we would play together.  You know Tony Vivacqua (ph.) you know on the playground might call me a nigger but you know I'd call him something else, you know.  And we would, you know--but it wasn't, it wasn't as, as hostile as it appeared to be with the parents of those kids.  I mean it was really--and I knew, I could sense that a lot of the, the hostilities and a lot of the, the feelings were, they were simply you know repeating what they heard at home about you know why it was bad for us to, to go to that school or what we were doing to the property values and all of these negative stereotypes that sometimes get associated with, with folk.  So I saw that firsthand.  It was very, in made an indelible kind of impact on me.
Story_ID: 7615
Speaker 1: Now what were you like when you were a little boy?  What did you like to do and how did you like school?
Speaker 2: I loved school.  I really enjoyed school.  I thrived in school.  I think it was probably because both of my parents [Solomon Eugene Gibbs and Annette Ames] were in education so they really stressed the importance of, of study you know.  I loved to read.  I used to read voraciously.  We--I remember my parents got me a set of encyclopedias and they had the Childcraft's set you know that was like different topics and stuff.  And then they had the real encyclopedias you know alphabet by alphabet.  And I, and I would just honestly get those books and just look through them you know and just looked at the pictures and read you know about certain things.  Now it wasn't anything that, that I was told to do.  I was an only child and as an only child sometimes you have to entertain yourself you know.  And I would get lost in the pages of looking through the encyclopedias and reading.  I, I enjoyed that a great deal and did very well you know in grammar school.  Part of it was because my parents, you know, really stressed to me the importance of studying.  And I was also very, very into sports, very athletic but I could only participate in sports you know when my schoolwork was completed.  And I think one of the best things my parents ever did was to put me into the Y, YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] over in South Chicago [Illinois] which was another learning experience because by that time I was only ten or eleven years old but I took public transportation to get to the Y.  And the YMCA there, the South Chicago YMCA was in another melting pot community.  It was primarily Latino and Polish and, and you know many of the kids English was not their first language and many of my friends there you know were either Puerto Rican or, or Mexican and they taught me at an early age the difference between Puerto Ricans and Mexicans and I didn't know that they didn't get along you know until I had conversations with them early, with kids you know.  And, and the Polish people that lived there that were indigenous to that area, immigrants working at the steel mill.  It was a very working class area you know where everybody was just trying to make it you know.  And, but it was great for me at an early age to interact with kids like that, you know, because it just gave me a very, an appreciation for differences you know and then I really took great pride that my friend Ricky Cabasa (ph.) you know was, was Latin and spoke Spanish and he was just as brown as me.  People used to think that we were brothers or whatever you know.  My other friends that were Mexican, you know, some of their--I'd go home and see how they ate and different things so that was a learning experience in and of itself.  But I was involved in a number of programs there, basketball, YBA [Youth Basketball Association] and swimming, I learned to swim and became the junior leader at the Y and you know so I was very involved there and would there probably three days a week you know for structured activities, gym, karate and all these things.  And I looked forward to going there so I would always have to make sure that my schoolwork was done.  So at a very early age I had a very regimented--and had developed study habits, you know, which I have carried and carried me throughout the rest of my life.
Speaker 1: And you were in a pretty good situation having educators as parents and being the only child?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, it was, it was, it was definitely a good thing for me.  And my mother was an English teacher so at a minimum she was going to make sure I could read and write very well.  So they corrected my grammar and this and that.  So I came to appreciate it only much later, you know, in life.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Yeah that's a pretty good situation.
Story_ID: 7616
Speaker 1: South Chicago is like a unique kind of place in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh yeah, it really is.
Speaker 1: There're so many different groups in there around the steel mills and this--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You talk about the sights and sounds of that.  I can remember going to the little bodegas and the aromas of the churros and the hot sauce and the peppers and looking at the Spanish newspapers that were much more visual and vivid than our newspapers that showed people massacred and all this stuff.  It was something else.  And it  was a, a real interesting time you know this is still you know '70s [1970s], early '70s.
Speaker 1: Yeah I think it was like, South Chicago was a Catholic church every five blocks.
Speaker 2: Our Lady Guadalupe, Our Lady Gate of Heaven, St. Peter, St. Paul--.
Speaker 1: Immaculate Conception.
Speaker 2: --Immaculate Conception.  You know I had friends that went to almost all of those schools you know.  And I remember Our Lady of Guadalupe you know and it was, it was an interesting time, interesting time.  Often when I go back, drive around those areas and you know think about some of those streets I ran you know although I was supposed to be at the Y [YMCA], I'd always sneak out with my friends somewhere, go to Goldblatt's (laughs), you know walk down Commercial Avenue, you know, do those things.  I probably knew that community, area better than I did my own background, you know backyard because I used to hang out around there quite a bit.
Story_ID: 7617
Speaker 1: Did you have any teachers that were like mentors or even at the Y [YMCA, Young Men's Christian Association], were there any, did any adult serve as a mentor to you in any way or a role model do you think?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess they did but not in an official capacity you know.  I mean there was a guy named 'Turkey', they used to call him 'Turkey' at the Y.  I don't know--Alfredo Reyes (ph.) I think was his name.  He was the program director you know at the Y and he for some was a surrogate father or mother I'm sure.  I had a father [Solomon Eugene Gibbs] and mother [Annette Ames] so--but I you know, I got a kick out of him and he was funny and gave us a very structured and safe place you know to hang out and play.  You know teachers, you know all of my teachers I think I learned something from.  When I went to Our Lady of Hungary [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] it was a Catholic School and there were still quite a few nuns in the convent that lived right next door to the church and they were all pretty old, but they were some characters as well.  I mean corporal punishment nothing, I mean they demanded you know strict discipline and you know spanking you in your hand, making you kneel on rulers or they would do some pretty crazy stuff now in, in retrospect, in thinking about it.  But the key was that they demanded discipline you know.  It really wasn't a question of disrupting the class, you know.  They would take you out, whip you, you know, make you stand against the wall you know, carry books.  I mean they, they really believed in corporal punishment but it was effective.  And the interesting thing is that the parents though believed in that for the most part.  You have very few instances of parents who would send their kids there and pay to send their kids there and not know you know that if you got out of line the nuns were going to take care of you.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a sense or did your parents ever really talk about why they sent you to Catholic school instead of a public school since they were both like public school educators?
Speaker 2: No, I went to public school for kindergarten and for first grade and then we as a family converted to Catholicism after we moved. And I think that you know because I was going to Catholic school, and I don't know which came first, I--but I was in Catholic school for second grade and then our family converted to Catholicism.  But it never really was an issue.  I just always went to Catholic school but never really discussed.  It was never really discussed.
Speaker 1: I was wondering if they ever discussed the public schools as being in some kind of crisis or something you know, I mean--.
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, I think their perception was that the schools that were in my community probably were not school--well not probably, were schools that they didn't want me to go to, you know.  And they had the means and, and ability to send me to a Catholic school and that's what they chose to do, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in high school now you went to St. Ignatius High School [St. Ignatius College Prep, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Went to St. Ignatius.
Speaker 1: Now how did you wind up choosing St. Ignatius, it's a long way from--?
Speaker 2: I didn't want to go to St. Ignatius.  I didn't want, I wanted to go to Mendel [Catholic High School, Chicago, Illinois] or Mount Carmel [High School, Chicago, Illinois].  I wanted to play football and I played football in grammar school and--but I was kind of slight.  So after going to visit with some of the freshmen coaches I wasn't necessarily encouraged you know to go to any of those schools.  But I had friends that went to Brother Rice [High School, Chicago, Illinois] and went to Mendel and they all played football.  St. Ignatius to me was a school that was known for its academic reputation.  And while I had the grades to go there, didn't have a football team and you know I, I kind of thought well--but my father you know suggested to me that if you can get in a school like St. Ignatius you know why not go there you know if you can get in?  So I applied, took the admissions test, got in and I was the only person from my school, from my grammar school to ever go to St. Ignatius cause it was so far away.  It was far away.  And got in and you know that's where I went.  That's where I went.
Story_ID: 7618
Speaker 1: Did you have to be careful traveling over there you know, to St. Ignatius [College Prep, Chicago, Illinois]--?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Yeah you definitely had to.  You definitely had to because you know at that time now we're talking about '79 [1979], '80 [1980].  The gangs started to really pick up in Chicago.  I know prior to that in the '60s [1960s] you know you had the, the Blackstone Rangers and all of this and that that had kind of evolved out or around during the Civil Rights Movement as well and this and that.  But now you know I remember around that time we were beginning to have gangs like Black Gangster Disciples and your [Conservative] Vice Lords, I mean all of these gangs were beginning to come into existence, except they weren't violent, as violent as they certainly are now.  I mean you know--.
Speaker 1: Yeah the drug thing hadn't--.
Speaker 2: The drug thing, right.
Speaker 1: --complete, completely yet.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: They were just getting involved in it.
Speaker 2: And that was starting to come cause this is you know '79 [1979], '80 [1980].  You know crack really hit our inner cities about '83, [1983] '84 [1984] is when you first started to see crack you know in New York.  It didn't come to Chicago until much later.
Speaker 1: Until the '90s [1990s], yeah.
Speaker 2: Exactly, but you know it was beginning to take root.  And because I was going from 95th Street you know so I would take a bus from my street to the 95th street terminal, then take a train downtown to--and then take another train back to Roosevelt [Road] and then get off the bus at Roosevelt and take Roosevelt Road bus you know down.  So it was about an hour, hour and a half commute every morning and every evening and I was going through a number of different communities you know.  So what I learned--and on the bus with kids from a number of different schools.  You know in the morning I might be on the bus with kids going to Harlan High School [Chicago, Illinois] and then you get to the 95th Street terminal where fights always broke out cause you had kids from the Catholic school, Mendel [Catholic High School, Chicago, Illinois] , Morgan Park [Academy, Chicago, Illinois], you know, Academy of Our Lady [Chicago, Illinois]-you had all of these school, school age kids converging you know at this particular terminal.  And then I might be on the L with kids who were going you know wherever they were going or coming back from wherever they were coming back.  So you, you had to be well versed on the different areas of where you were and we knew that certain areas were run by certain gangs, you know.  And you know it would not be atypical for you to be on a bus or you to be on a train you know and you get you know, I won't say accosted but you know challenged let's just say by some of these you know gang bangers as to where you were from.  And they used to say you know who do you represent you know and what set do you ride with and whatever, who do you, what do you ride and whatever.  And they had all these intricate hand signals and signs and you know all of this.  That--.
Speaker 1: Used to be how your hat is turned.
Speaker 2: How your hat was turned to the left or to the right.  If you had a pirate's hat on or you know all of these various things.
Speaker 1: And the colors meant something.  I remember in Chicago--,
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --they were talking about how the--,
Speaker 2: It was, it was--.
Speaker 1: --yellow and black was one gang and--,
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --blue and gray--,
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --and black was the Disciples I think.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  It was like I remember gold and black was one thing cause that was like the Pittsburg Pirates hat for while there everybody used to wear their Pittsburg Pirate hat.
Speaker 1: They won the World Series and, and I think the P, what's the, what do they call that, the--?
Speaker 2: The Pirate insignia?
Speaker 1: Yeah the--yeah it stood for the P something nation.
Speaker 2: P. Stone Nation, Black P. Stone Nation.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) P, P. Stone.  P. Stone Nation.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  Right, so this was near that time you know and I never felt ever really threatened about that because at that time you know the most that would happen is you would get beat up.  I mean it's not as violent as it is you know and became later on where you risked being shot and all of that stuff.  They weren't robbing, taking kids' shoes and Starter jackets yet.  You know this was prior to all of that so you know I never felt in any grave danger you know.  I never really traveled alone though you know.  You always had one or two buddies with you.
Speaker 1: But you had to start out alone.  I mean you were the only--you knew others from your community going to St. Ignatius?
Speaker 2: Some, you know it would usually work out that--you know there are always a bunch of kids that had to come to 95th Street.  That's the last stop on the line and either kids lived you know west going towards the Plaza or they lived you know out even further south you know or whatever, you know.  On my particular bus to get to, I was the only person you know.  But once I got to 95th Street I usually always see somebody that went to the school or something.  And then eventually I reached a point in high school I started driving you know because my mother passed when I was sixteen.  So you know by the time I was seventeen whatever, a car was there so I used to drive, had my own car so to speak.
Story_ID: 7619
Speaker 1: High school was fine.  It was great.  I played sports.
Speaker 2: Did you--what did you play?
Speaker 1: I played basketball, was on the swim team.  I was involved, heavily involved in student government.  By my senior year [St. Ignatius College Prep, Chicago, Illinois] was president of our student body you know, on our executive committee or whatever it was called.  So, I was also involved in a program called Link Unlimited which was a scholarship program that I had got into once I had already gotten into Ignatius.  And it's a scholarship program that corporations paid the tuition for, or individuals who sponsor students, who will pay the tuition for a student if they maintained a certain grade point average.  And you know it was a, it was dynamic, it is a dynamic organization.  It's a great organization.
Speaker 2: It's called Link?
Speaker 1: Link Unlimited.
Speaker 2: Link Unlimited.
Speaker 1: Yeah, founded by Father [Thomas] Tom Swade.
Story_ID: 7620
Speaker 1: You say your mother passed when you were sixteen?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, when I was sixteen my mother [Annette Ames] passed.  She had cancer and she had a car accident and in the midst of them trying to find out what caused her to pass out while she was driving you know they discovered that she had cancer.  And so she had a prolonged battle you know with cancer.  It started to spread from her lungs, you know, to her brain so she died in 1980, December of 1980.
Speaker 1: That had to be kind of rough in high school.  You had kind of a small family anyway, just your mother and father [Solomon Eugene Gibbs] and you?
Speaker 2: My mother, my father and at that time my brother was born in 1976.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he was quite young when she passed.  He was only four.  So that was a, a very traumatic time, made me grow up a lot, made me assume a lot of responsibility and become a bit more serious I think a lot earlier on than a lot of my peers.  But my father was, you know, an incredible role model because of his desire to want to keep our family together.  Didn't want me to go stay with my grandmother and my little brother you know to go live with my aunt or whatever.  He kept us very, very close and you know it was, it was, it was--you know I often hear the story of the single parent that's a father,  you know. I got a chance to witness that first hand.  And it was, it was remarkable.
Speaker 1: Well that's, you know growing, that period of time in transition when your adolescence is tough on a lot of young people anyway and then to have something like that, that's probably--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But it was--you know it's funny I often tease him about the stories of taking him out with me on a Friday or Saturday night you know he was four or five years old, you know.  And I had a car so, you know, I had mobility, but I'd have to take him with me you know.  I was the designated babysitter most of the time.  So on a Friday night if I knew there was a party going on or something you know I'd customarily roll up to the party late.  Well part of it was cause I was waiting for him to go to sleep. (Laughs)  But I had him in the back seat asleep and I'd roll up to the party, everybody thought I was just trying to be real cool cause I wouldn't go in the party, I'd just hang outside on my car.  Well the real reason was cause I couldn't go in the party and leave him outside asleep in the back seat. (Laughs)  So we laugh about that a lot because this was prior to car seats and all that stuff.  He'd just be on the back seat asleep and I'd be hanging out with my friends and we'd all be on our cars, you know.  And people thought we were always just trying to be real cool you know.  They may have been but I, I, I really couldn't leave that car.  I had to hang out, outside the party.
Story_ID: 7621
Speaker 1: When did you graduate from St. Ignatius [College Prep, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Graduated from St. Ignatius in 1982.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1982.  Now because you're the president of 'Vibe' magazine, this question is relevant.  But this is a time when I guess rap music was emerging.
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: I guess.  So--,
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: --can you remember the first rap music you ever heard?
Speaker 2: Yeah I absolutely can.  Actually the first rap music I ever heard was probably back in 1978, '79 [1979] and it was the Sugarhill Gang.  'The Message'--well not the Sugarhill--'Rapper's Delight' [Sugarhill Gang song], you know.  And at that time rap music was still kind of a fringe kind of thing you know.  They didn't play it on the radio certainly and it was, it had an edge to it you know and a lot, particularly in Chicago [Illinois].  Chicago you know was big for at that time in concert to, to the rap music going on you also had emergence of the house music scene, okay, and I was privy to seeing that as a, as a music form kind of come to life, this is Steve 'Silk' Hurley and Frankie Knuckles and all of these guys who were taking disco music and using the extended play version of it.  And it became what's become known as house music, you know and, and using a lot of like I said a lot of disco music, recycled it and turned it into house music.  So that was--,
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Mixing it and stuff like that.
Speaker 2: --much, much more popular in Chicago than, than rap music.  But I, I always loved rap music, you know.  I, I always craved and took every opportunity I could you know to keep up on what was going on with rap music.  But like I said it was through you know Chicago with the house music.  We used to have this period called, we called it punkin' out.  But it was basically with punk, when the punk scene hit, you know, which was The B-52's and all of these various groups, you know.  And we used to have these parties at these lofts you know, different places.  So I was always kind of on the outer edge with regard to the music that I, I followed in life.  It was always you know kind of what's next?  And it really--in earnest--so 'Rapper's Delight', '77 [1977], '78 [1978] and then by the time I got to college and I went to Williams College in [Williamstown] Massachusetts and you know kids--there were so many kids there from the East Coast who were from New York and from the various boroughs in New York and everybody you know that, that was down was really you know into hip hop or rap music.  So that's when I really you know got turned out and turned on full blast to the whole hip hop scene and that's when I was able to come you know from Massachusetts to New York City [New York].  You know, I remember the first time I set foot in New York City I came with a friend of mine home.  I was invited home by him for Thanksgiving cause I didn't go all the way back to Chicago and he said, "Let's go to New York," and he brought me to New York.  We got off the train at Penn Station.  And I remember my first memory of getting off that train was the police chasing a guy who had just snatched the train--a chain, you know.  And I felt like that song by I think it's Marvin Gaye or Stevie Wonder, you know, "New York City, just like I thought it'd be. Tall buildings--."
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Right, that's Stevie Wonder, right.
Speaker 2: Stevie Wonder.
Speaker 1: Skyscrapers--.
Speaker 2: Skyscrapers you know--,
Speaker 1: And everything.
Speaker 2: --it was just like that.  I mean I saw the police chasing the guy as soon as I stepped off the train and I was like wow, you know. And just the lights and the, the cabs and just the pace of it was, was intoxicating.  I was like wow.  And then to see cats you know break dancing as soon as we get off at Penn Station you walk outside and I'm seeing cats, you know, break dancing for money on their, spinning on their heads and all of this.  And it was a, it was a really you know fun time you know to see all of that.
Speaker 1: You know now you were an adolescent I guess during the time that videos made their emergence too as a big art form on television.
Speaker 2: Yeah they were beginning to emerge. They were like on late night shows, you know.  It was just--MTV [Music Television] was just--but at that time MTV wasn't playing black videos.  It wasn't until really [Michael Jackson's] 'Thriller' in '80--I don't know 6 [1986].
Speaker 1: '82 [1982], '82.
Speaker 2: Was it '82?
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: When they played 'Thriller'?
Speaker 1: I know it was like well '80--.
Speaker 2: --4 [1984]?
Speaker 1: Yeah you're right, '84 [1984] [Sic, Michael Jackson's album 'Thriller' was released in 1982; the video for the song 'Thriller' was released in 1983].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: '84 [1984] or so cause my son was about two and a half.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was born in 1982.
Speaker 2: And then, but it was even a little while longer before 'Yo! MTV Raps' [television program] you know hit and, and yeah that really had the commercialization of rap music and hip hop music--.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --really took off.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  You have a, I think an earlier--right it was mostly white music was on the videos in the early days.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm, absolutely.
Speaker 1: There're some artists who would come, like they--I remember seeing Prince I think early on maybe or--,
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Michael Jackson and there were some people--.
Speaker 2: Certainly no hip hop.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No hip hop, no hip hop.
Speaker 1: Michael Jackson and one of The Beatles, John--Paul McCartney had a--it was that kind of you know.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  But yeah and you know hip hop and rap music, but at that time was really just hip hop--I mean rap music you know.  It hadn't evolved into the cultural force that it is now you know.  There was break dancing and there was graffiti you know and there was a fashion sensibility to it, but all the dots hadn't really been connected in the way that it's come to be connected now.  And, and it wasn't influencing popular culture as much as it is now.
Speaker 1: So when you were in high school who was the most popular musician in the black community would you say, when you were in high school, when you graduated--?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You graduated in 82 [1982]?
Speaker 2: '82?
Speaker 1: So who would be the top musician--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That's a good question.
Speaker 1: --when you--who were you all looking at then?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.
Speaker 1: And then you were a scholar too.  You might not have been the most, you know--.
Speaker 2: (Laughing).  No, I was--wait, I was a scholar but I was hip, I wasn't square. (Laughing) I wasn't square.  I still used to go out and party a lot you know.  But, that's a good question.  I guess it was groups like you know Anita Ward, "You can ring my bell" [from the song 'Ring My Bell'] and those types.  But that's even earlier.  That's like '80 [1980], '80, '79 [1979], '80.  I'm thinking you know maybe The Barkays, Captain Sky, man I'm trying to think of--.
Speaker 1: George Clinton, was he big then?
Speaker 2: George Clinton, the P-Funk [All-Stars],  yeah, yeah.  That was even earlier too.  I remember George Clinton like in '78 [1978], '79 [1979], 'Aqua Boogie' and all them songs.
Speaker 1: Maybe Rick James maybe.
Speaker 2: Rick James, yeah.
Speaker 1: For that era, I guess in '82, '81, '82?
Speaker 2: Yeah Rick James was, was big.
Speaker 1: I think Prince had nine--'1999' came out [in 1982].
Speaker 2: Prince was, was big.  I wasn't much of a big, big Prince fan but Prince was pretty big, Earth Wind and Fire you know was big.  And Michael Jackson was really one of the biggest names, black musicians at that time.
Speaker 1: Right, I think 'Off the Wall' [Michael Jackson album, released in 1979] was still--.
Speaker 2: 'Off the Wall' was still big.  So that's you know that era that I remember very well and it was a lot of fun.
Story_ID: 7622
Speaker 1: Now you went to Williams College in [Williamstown] Massachusetts.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Williamstown, Massachusetts.
Speaker 1: Now how did you choose Williams College?
Speaker 2: You know I was accepted into West Point.  I was supposed to go the United States Military Academy [West Point, New York].  I had taken my physical exam and scored very high on the aptitude test and had even gotten my congressman's letter of endorsement and but I also visited [University of] Notre Dame [Notre Dame, Indiana].  I visited Georgetown [University, Washington, D.C.], U of I [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Illinois], you know.  I went--Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois], had a scholarship to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And Williams was recommended to me by another alum friend of mine that had gone to [St.] Ignatius [College Prep, Chicago, Illinois] that had gotten a pretty big financial aid package from Williams and the director of the Link Unlimited program Father [Thomas] Swade you know had told him about it.  I don't know whether he had come home from break or something and was telling me--I had gotten some information from Williams as well.  I had gotten information from a number of schools you know after you take your PSATs [Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Tests]  and SATs [Scholastic Aptitude Tests]  and this and that you get all these deluge of, of requests and I was an Illinois State Scholar so all the Illinois schools I had gotten scholarship you know offers from.  And for whatever, whatever reason you know in looking at Williams and they invited me to come out you know for like a weekend and I just fell in love with the place, absolutely fell in love with it.  It was very small, 2,100 students.  It's in the Berkshire Valley, Massachusetts, very close to the Vermont border.  And it was just unlike any place I had ever really visited and been before.
Story_ID: 7623
Speaker 1: I think that's one reason why I enjoyed the opportunity to go to a place like Williams [College, Williamstown, Massachusetts] because it was a place that was so far removed from you know Chicago [Illinois] in terms of number one, just the beauty.  I mean you're talking about a place that's surrounded by a mountain valley you know.  And it was like a, from my perspective, a country club in a lot of ways although I had never been to a country club.  But you know I mean just all the facilities you could ever want.  I mean we had our own ski area right there at the college you know, golf course, tennis courts.  It had been around since the 1700s, so it was a real unique place to me and I came to understand why I liked it so much cause it was really very sheltered from the real world.  You know, the people there were so nice you know, too nice you know.
Speaker 2: Was it named after Roger Williams or--?
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't.  Ephraim Williams [Jr.]--,
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --it was named after.  And interestingly enough you know it had its very first black graduate early on in the 1800s who went on to, to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  So it, you know--.
Speaker 2: Who was that?  Let me just put you on the spot here?
Speaker 1: Yeah, his name was--I knew you were going to ask me that, [Gaius Charles] Bolin, Bolin, B-O-L-I-N.  And his first name I forget but he was--and W.E.B. DuBois, DuBois I think was not--in Pitts, Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  I think he was  from Pittsfield, Massachusetts or you know spent a lot of time in Pittsfield, Massachusetts which wasn't very far from Williams.
Speaker 2: DuBois?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He's from Great Barrington [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Great Barrington.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, which is very, right by Pittsfield, it's all around there you know.  So it, it you know was a place where you know it was a part of the old abolitionist movement.  It had ties to the Underground Railroad and all of these types of things, you know.  Not that that existed necessarily in 1982 or so when I went there.
Speaker 2: Was Williams a religious-sponsored school?
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't.  It wasn't.  It was non-denominational.  It is a very--had--enjoyed a rich academic tradition.  But also you know like a lot of schools of its ilk you know small, elite, liberal arts school and it opened up a whole another world to me in terms of, you know, privileged people.  You know people whose families had enjoyed wealth, you know, for many generations whether it was--one of my classmates was Brad DuPont you know an heir to the DuPont [chemical company] fortune.  Another classmate of mine was Ian Brzezinski whose father [Zbigniew Brzezinski] was, you know, ambassador to UN [United Nations].  There were just a number of individuals like that who you know went to school with me.  And many of them, you know, I never knew, Bronfman of the Seagram family.  Edgar Bronfman [Jr., became president of Seagram Company] was a classmate of mine.  At that time you know those names didn't really mean a lot to me and I didn't really know you know, Ed Lewis of the [S.C.] Johnson Wax fortune [now known as S. C. Johnson & Son, Inc.] was a classmate of mine so you know a lot of people--and I got the opportunity obviously to get to know these folks and be in classes with them and have these debates and things with them you know and I found that to be really, really interesting and intriguing.  And I played sports at Williams.  I went to Williams and I played lacrosse for three years.  I was a letterman.  Lacrosse was a sport, sport that was totally foreign to me.  And I remember the first time I came home with my lacrosse stick I went for a run in Palmer Park [Chicago, Illinois] to run for training cause I came home and a brother rolled down the window, "Yo man, what is that?  What is it cricket?  What is that?  What is that you got," you know.  And I had my lacrosse stick.  And it was really, it was a great sport.  It's a sport by the way that I learned--I didn't know that [professional football player] Jim Brown was an all-American lacrosse player at Syracuse [University, Syracuse, New York] with my coach actually at Williams.  And one of the reasons I think why he kind of sought me out to play lacrosse was that you know he played with Jim Brown at Syracuse and told me that and suggested that maybe I try it you know.  I was just an athlete, you know.  I could, I was going to play--I didn't know what I was going to play.  I could play--that was one reason why I wanted to go to a small school like that because it was division three and if you were a decent athlete and you played you know my freshman year I was going to play basketball.  I rowed crew my freshman year instead because I really wanted to try to do stuff that I had never done before and it afforded me the opportunity to do that.  I could have played football again but D-back [defensive back] coach for football convinced me, he was also the head lacrosse coach.  So he's the person that said hey you didn't play competitive football in high school.  Most of the guys have.  No doubt you could probably play here anyway, but I think you would be a better lacrosse player you know.  So he worked with me and I ended up playing for three years.  It was just a great experience, great sport.  And to this day I'm still involved with lacrosse.  I coach my son's lacrosse team up in a little town and my daughter plays lacrosse now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's bigger on the East Coast--,
Speaker 1: It's big, real big here.
Speaker 2: --yeah, than it is in the Midwest I guess.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah it's growing in popularity but it's, it's very big out here.
Speaker 2: Jim Brown, the idea of him carrying a stick too, as big as he--.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: It's scary.
Speaker 1: I've seen old videotape of him playing the game and you know that blinding speed and his ability just almost run over people you know in a game like lacrosse made him unstoppable, you know.  And I really believe that if more African Americans were introduced to it earlier on there would be many more playing the sport competitively.  And it's interesting even when you look at some of the division one teams now that make it to the tournament you know whether it's Syracuse or you know [Johns] Hopkins [University, Baltimore, Maryland] or even [University of] Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia] you know there's always a few brothers out there which is good to see.
Story_ID: 7624
Speaker 1: Well what was your major at Williams [College, Williamstown, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: I was a major in political economy which was really like a double major in political science and economics.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now that's, that should have been very interesting in that place with the kind of people that were around you there.
Speaker 2: Very interesting.
Speaker 1: Did it make studies come alive more?  I mean you're-.
Speaker 2: Very much.  It made for great political debate.  It made for early on a consciousness of just you know the political process and that's, that's what I studied.  So--.
Speaker 1: You've got  [United States National Security Advisor], Zbigniew Brzezinski's son [Ian Brzezinski] there and a DuPont [Brad DuPont of the DuPont chemical company].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the descendants of all these men in business?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was phenomenal.  It was incredible.  I mean, you know, early on it was, it was interesting.  This is how telling it was.  I remember going down for lunch and, and you had kids there reading 'Wall Street Journal' you know. Not because they're preparing for job interviews but because they just read the 'Wall Street Journal.'
Speaker 1: Oh they, they're part of some of the businesses.
Speaker 2: That's absolutely, absolutely right.  Absolutely right.  So that kind of elevated the whole level of, of conversation and everything, you know.  It was really interesting for me, very telling.  Another very good friend of mine Jeff Lilley, his father was James [Roderick] Lilley who was our ambassador to, to Taiwan was really our ambassador who led our negotiations with China.  And you know till this day he appears on '60 Minutes' [television program] and Fox News and all of the news programs as the U.S.'s official--I mean as a U.S. expert on Asian relations.  And I remember my freshman year, early on like the first or second day of school I heard you know some rap music coming out of a, a room so I kind of went, knocked on the door.  I was going to introduce myself no doubt to the brother whose room it was and say who it was and door opens and it's my man James--Jeff Lilley, you know a white guy and he was from [Washington] D.C., and very well traveled because his parents were you know in the Foreign Service and whatever.  And that was him playing the jams you know and he's like I'm so and so, so and so, come on in.  Invited me in and I'm kind of looking around, looking on his desk and I see a picture of his family with at that time it was [U.S.] President [Ronald] Reagan, in the White House in front of a fire place. (Laughs) So I point to it and I'm like, "Is that you?"  He's like, "Yeah that's me."  It was Vice President [George Herbert Walker] Bush, Sr. now you know and a picture of Reagan, Bush and his family around a Christmas tree at the White House.  So he said, "Well yeah."  He said, you know,  "George Bush is my godfather you know and you know my father works with him in government," this and that.  It wasn't until you know much later on that I really learned the full extent of, of their whole relationship and--but that just speaks to just you know the various folks that, that I came into contact with on a daily basis, played sports with and partied with and this and that.  So, it was a great experience.
Speaker 1: Now when you're that close to people that are around so much power does that make them like bigger or does that make them more accessible?
Speaker 2: More accessible?
Speaker 1: Yeah does it make them like less accessible?  I mean do you look at them and say wow, this is so-and-so or do they seem more like regular people you know and do they make it seem--?
Speaker 2: Well it was interesting man.  I mean you know it really showed me the difference between folks that had had money for generations, you know.  Many times you didn't often know that they were as wealthy as they were.  You know they weren't the kids who were driving around in Porsches and all of these exotic cars you know.  They tended to be much more down to earth and, and just much more normal folks.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Did they wear a lot of gold?  No gold?
Speaker 2: Not at all.  They were very, you know, reserved.  Many of the kids that I went to school with had all gone to prep school.  It was a lot of them you know.  Some of your most prestigious prep schools you know Groton Academy [sic, Groton School, Groton, Massachusetts] or Phillips Exeter [Academy, Exeter, New Hampshire] or you know [Phillips] Andover Academy [Andover, Maryland], a number of your, your well known St. Petersburg [sic, St. Paul's School, Concord, New Hampshire], where [U.S. Senator John] Kerry went, you know.  They had a certain pedigree.  I, I came to understand what it meant when people talk in terms you know your pedigree so to speak, your educational pedigree or what country club living really was.  You know I, I had never been to a country club before until my roommate who was from the South, his father was a doctor, invited me--we were driving up from a spring break trip to his home in Atlanta [Georgia].  And he told me that we couldn't, you know we needed to hurry up when we got to his house and get dressed cause we were supposed to meet his father at the club for lunch.  I didn't know what he meant by club, went to this very palatial country club.  It was my first time kind of seeing that you know.  We--I was disappointed cause we had to wear a coat and tie you know to meet his father for lunch but it was, it was once again one more of those eye opening kind of experiences that you had.  But you know I really just saw it as, as an opportunity to just kind of learn you know and observe and you know aspire for whatever else, you know.  Wouldn't trade it for anything else in the world, anything else in the world.

Speaker 1: Who were some of the memorable teachers or administrators there at Williams [College, Williamstown, Massachusetts]?  Did anybody really connect with you I mean as a person that you admired where you could really learn something from?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you know unlike some students I never really embraced that whole relationship with, with faculty, you know.  I just didn't, like there are some folks who you know might you know kind of gravitate towards a particular--and I found that hard when I was applying for graduate school because in reflecting back I realize that I really didn't you know take advantage of opportunities like that to really bond with faculty members or whatever.  There were a number of faculty folks, professors and such who I really enjoyed being in their class.  They were very smart and very whatever you know but I never like I wasn't the type of guy that would go to dinner with professors and this and that. (Laughs) That just, that just wasn't me.  I was playing sports and doing my thing and having fun.  I was always--but I--we all knew who each other were you know.  I had been to dinner at the president's house at, of the college and this and that.  You know I knew the deans and such but I never really took the opportunity to get very close to, to the faculty apart from coaches, you know.  I knew my coaches pretty well.  But you know I remember one semester we had a visiting professor, a noted historian by the name of Kenneth Stampp who wrote the book, 'Peculiar Institution' right.  And he was a guest lecturer and I took his course on slavery and antebellum South.  And you know it was just so amazing to me his lecture style and he was an old distinguished look and he liked the quintessential you know East Coast establishment professor who wore his tweed jacket to class and his bow tie everyday.  And after every lecture we stood up and clapped and it was just amazing.  It was just you, know the protocol of this--and it wasn't, we just stood up and clapped you know because we felt it was what we were supposed to do.  We didn't do that at all but it was just you know the fact that, that you know we enjoyed his lectures that much, you know.  It kind of reminded me of some, something out of some movie or something you know.  We had a number of professors like that who were very, very--they were noted scholars and very intellectual you know.  And it was just assumed that every student that came to their classes were prepared.  I mean it was just, you know the classes were usually very small so it was very conducive to discussion you know and debating and I enjoyed that. I enjoyed that.
Story_ID: 7626
Speaker 1: Was that the closest you came to Black Studies or something at Williams [College, Williamstown, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: They had Black Studies at Williams.
Speaker 1: Did they? Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they did have Black Studies and we had black professors at Williams, one or two.  We had a theater professor, two theater professors, a dance professor, a theater professor, a professor of English.  I took a class of his and our Black Studies department you know was headed up by an African American brother.  I took a couple of courses with him as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So very small African American community.  I'd probably say out of 2,100 students we probably had about 7 or 8 percent African American.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So maybe you know, ninety-five or a hundred, two hundred you know.  On a good day two hundred folks depending on when it was that you counted.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have all the black fraternities or sororities represented?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't have any fraternity or sororities whatsoever on the college campus.  They were banned from the college in the '60s [1960s] which I think was, was interesting you know because it, it didn't provide, you know, an opportunity for that exclusiveness sometimes you know fraternal and sorority organizations can have on a campus be they black or be they white just in general.  It was against the philosophy of the school.  You, you had various dining halls that you were associated with but nothing, no organized, you know, things.  Basically it boiled down to your interest you know.  I pretty much hung out with all of the guys that played sports you know so all the lacrosse players and football players, we would all hang out together you know.  And they had folks that were you know were academians they would hang out together and whatever.  And we had you know it was more like that you know than, than very strict you know this fraternity, that fraternity, this sorority, that sorority.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there a black student organization?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had a black student union.  We had a house there on campus which was good.  It provided a place, a refuge for folks sometimes when they just wanted to, you know, go there and just be around other black folk and, and talk and you know do that.  And we'd have parties and stuff, yeah.  It was, it was good.  It was good to have that on campus.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any surrounding schools of black students that were, you all would--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we used to road trip all the time, go down to Smith College [Northampton, Massachusetts] which was all-women's college, Wellesley College [Wellesley, Massachusetts], (laughing) Holyoke, Mount Holyoke College [South Hadley, Massachusetts], we'd go down to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], go to Yale [University, New Have, Connecticut].  We would basically do the whole--.
Speaker 1: Ya'll must've been popular going to the all-girls colleges?
Speaker 2: Well you know we would go to the all-girls colleges because they would always let us know what was going on you know.  (Laughs) They would always have dances or parties you know and inevitably somebody knew somebody at all those schools so after a while you kind of got a network you know whether it was Vassar [College, Poughkeepsie, New York] or whatever, you know.  My wife [Karen] actually went to Babson College [Wellesley, Massachusetts] which is in Wellesley and I knew her from high school you know and I had another friend I knew from high school that went to Wellesley.  So you know people would keep in touch and you know it would, it would not be atypical for you to be on campus and all of a sudden you know somebody that you know you knew from high school calls your room and they're at your college just because they came up with some other friends and they said they knew you and you know, so it was, it was good, good network.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now would we know any of your black classmates now are they gone on to--with it being such a, I guess a focused college environment you know, have some of them gone on to do big things or would we know any of their names?
Speaker 2: I don't really think so.  I mean a number of them have gone on to very successful careers in finance or in you know law or various things.  But I don't think--none that come to mind that you know would be very, very popular that I can think of.
Story_ID: 7627
Speaker 1: You graduated [Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts] in--.
Speaker 2: '86 [1986].
Speaker 1: --'86 okay, all right.  What was that like?  Did you graduate with honors or anything for did you have anything special associated with graduation?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  It was just time to go.  (Laughs) I'm ready to go.  I enjoyed it but after four years you know it was time to take it to that next phase.  I went into banking right after I graduated.  It was kind of natural for me.  I had interned for three of my four summers of college at a bank, a financial institution so--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Were you--did you stay there or did you--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I'm sorry, for all four years I was in banking.  I did three summers at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago [Illinois] and then my senior summer I was here in New York [New York] on Wall Street at Chemical Bank.  So you know I was in intent on a career in finance, financial services and that's what I did.  I turned down an offer to come work at Chemical Bank in New York because I wanted to go back to Chicago because my family was there.  My brother by that time was all of you know eleven or twelve years old so I felt like I had missed a large kind of part of his life.  So I felt like going back to Chicago, you know, that I would be more central you know and could play a bigger role in his development.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you went back and--.
Speaker 2: Worked for the Northern Trust Company.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was in their trust investment services area.  And because I had had three prior summers of working there, you know, I went back, it was kind of like going back home.  I had developed a number of good relationships, had a number of mentors already in place.  So it was a very easy transition for me and, you know, therefore I found it very easy to kind of navigate my way through.  I made trust officer in a very short period of time and I think I was one of the youngest or the youngest trust investment officers that they had named there early on.  I was pretty proud of that.  But it was also during that time that I decided that I wanted to go to graduate school so I went and applied to Northwestern's [University, Evanston, Illinois] Kellogg School [of Management]  and began the night time studies there.  So I was going to work during the day and going to school at night and, and went through that program basically finishing up with a degree and masters in management which is their version of an M.B.A. and it was a double major in marking and in finance.
Story_ID: 7628
Speaker 1: Now were you married by this time [after graduating from Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois]  or did you--?
Speaker 2: No, I was not married.  I was still single.
Speaker 1: Did you meet your wife [Karen], I mean your future wife--?
Speaker 2: My wife and I had met, we had known each other since we were eighteen.  We met at her senior prom at Kenwood [High School, Chicago, Illinois] oddly enough and we just maintained close contact.  She was at the time still living on Boston [Massachusetts] and--.
Speaker 1: She went to Wellesley [College, Wellesley, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: She went to Babson [College, Wellesley, Massachusetts]--,
Speaker 1: Babson, okay.
Speaker 2: --which is in Wellesley, Massachusetts.  So she was still living in Boston and I was living in Chicago [Illinois] and you know it wasn't until she moved to, back to Chicago from Boston after having been out there for seven years after school you know that we began to date much more seriously and, and later to marriage.
Story_ID: 7629
Speaker 1: You're working at Northern Trust [Company, Chicago, Illinois] and going to school at Northwestern's [University, Evanston, Illinois] Kellogg School [of Management].
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Well anything about Kellogg School that's interesting that you learned that you--?
Speaker 2: Well it was interesting for me to go to school in a night program where, when I matriculated into Kellogg I was still quite young.  I was probably twenty-four where the median age from most of the folks in the night program was probably about thirty, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty.  So unlike, you know, college you know there, there wasn't really a lot of, or at least I didn't really build a lot of long lasting relationships.  It was really more focused on course work.  And while you know the night program relied heavily on casework, you know, so that would give you the occasion to you know have peace and deal with classmates to work on a case together you know.  It really didn't facilitate for me you know those relationships that I think are fostered you know if you're in an intensive two year you know program.  But it was, it was fine for me.  I mean I learned an awful, awful lot and really it was my coursework at Kellogg that got me interested in advertisement which ultimately led me to the Leo Burnett Company [Leo Burnett Worldwide, Inc.] and which ultimately led me to 'Vibe'.  It was--I had taken a course in advertising in the course of a marketing curriculum and I really found it intriguing you know.  I said god you know I think I would really enjoy advertising but I had felt that I was already kind of pigeonholing myself for this finance track and oddly enough I met a guy who was the Senior V.P. [vice president] of H.R. [human resources] at Leo Burnett which is you know the largest advertising agency in Chicago and was at the time.  And we began this conversation and I told him you know I've always had an interest in advertising but you know never ever pursued it.  One thing led to another and it was his suggestion that I come to sit with him and talk about advertising or a career in advertising.  Well at that time, little did I know that Burnett was recruiting M.B.A.s very heavily at that time because his strategy was to have newly minted M.B.A.s to serve as counterparts to their clients who were typically newly minted M.B.A.s on the brand side.  So, you know, little did I know that I was really interviewing for a job at Burnett.  They made me an offer to come in as a client service representative, very junior level on the account management side through a program they had to train you.  And they're one of the few agencies that actually had a training course you know in account management.  So I went, got into that and you know found that I really, really enjoyed the nature of that work.  I enjoyed the creative process although I wasn't creative.  I enjoyed the marketing, the advertising you know the marshalling of the, the process, the client relationship building side of the business.  I worked on brands like Sealy Posturepedic, I worked for about three years on the Marlboro brand which was really interesting working on a cigarette brand.  I worked on Miller Lite, Miller Lite Ice, excuse me.  So it was, it was a lot of fun and that's where I developed my, you know marketing acumen, advertising acumen, so it was interesting.
Story_ID: 7630
Speaker 1: So you were at Leo Burnett [Worldwide, Inc.].  When did you start at Leo Burnett--?
Speaker 2: God I must have started at Leo Burnett in about '90 [1990]--no, '89 [1989] something like that, '89 or '90, something like--it seems later than that, '88 [1988] something like that.  I graduated from school [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] and I was at Northern Trust [Company].  No it must have been about, about '90, '89, '90 I started at Burnett.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think it was '90 [1990].
Speaker 1: So you went to Northern Trust in '86 [1986] I guess?
Speaker 2: Right, so I think I was there from '86 [1986] to like '90 [1990] and then I think I started at Burnett from '90 [1990] to, to '94 [1994]?  Yeah, to like '94.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well let me ask you about Mike Hall.  I have a note here to ask you about him.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Who was Mike Hall?
Speaker 2: Mike Hall when he retired from Burnett was the senior most ranking African American at Burnett.  He was responsible for strategic planning for the entire agency which is a multi-billion dollar agency in terms of worldwide billings.  And he was responsible for basically their worldwide development plan.  I worked for Mike on his Miller business and, you know, Mike in addition to being just a phenomenal leader because he was always just smarter than everybody else around him, had a very distinctive style and manner to him.  And I learned an awful lot from him in terms of management style, you know, both from an advertising perspective and in terms of just a business perspective how to analyze and look at a business situation you know and serve up the best alternatives you know either for a client or looking at the business.  You can very quickly you know kind of unravel the onion to get to the heart of what the real business issue is.  Really, really well regarded in the advertising community for you know his, his advertising and business acumen and a tough--he was very tough.  Tough on, tough on issues and sometimes tough on people you know.  He definitely had a, a high regard for excellence and really forced people to toe the line.  He was a Vietnam vet, decorated you know veteran you know.  I remember Mike's quote to me that I always, I always remembered this, you know, I remember we were in a particularly tough situation you know with a client and very stressful kind of situation.  And Mike said, "You know, I've had people shooting at me in helicopters man.  This, I went through Vietnam.  It is nothing that I couldn't face you know in the business world that would ever have me you know as stressed as living through Vietnam."  So that kind of puts in perspective I think you know his view on business.  It was easy to him.  It was nothing that rattled him because he had persevered so much more.  And he you know was a, was a unique African American in that to me in corporate America he always demonstrate, demonstrated an ability to have the utmost degree of dignity and, and make you respect you know him.  He was never one to sugarcoat, never one to play a subservient kind of role you know or really ever one to really care about you know what someone might think of him so to speak.  He was him.  He was distinctive.  He was brash.  But yet it was always calculated, you know.  You were ever going to outsmart Mike Hall you know because he, you know was very well read from a business perspective and usually had thought about your situation fifteen times more than you had thought about it if you were the client.  So they really respected him for that and I saw that day in and day out.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now he was a--I made a note here that he was a mentor to somebody, to Andrew Strauff (ph. UNABLE TO VERIFY).
Speaker 2: Yeah, Andrew Strauff.  He was definitely a, definitely was and is a mentor to me without question.  Yeah, we talk pretty often.
Story_ID: 7631
Speaker 1: So what happened at Leo Burnett [Worldwide, Inc.] to lead you to--?
Speaker 2: To 'Vibe' [magazine]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well you know when I was at Burnett a friend of mine gave me a call, guy who I had met as an intern here in New York by the name of Keith Clinkscales.  And Keith had been here in New York and had caught the publishing bug and had his own along with a friend of his Lynn Burnett, started a, a, a New York kind of based, New York-centric magazine for young, urban professionals called Ups--what was it called?
Speaker 1: Was it 'Upscale'?
Speaker 2: No it wasn't Up--it was called, 'Urban Profiles', 'Urban Profiles'.  And because of doing that and this and that he had been tapped to, by the folks at Time Warner when Quincy Jones when to Time Warner and said hey I got this idea for a magazine that's going to chroniclize black artists, black you know musical artists, very similar to what 'Rolling Stone' is for rock and roll.  Quincy had this vision for a magazine to be a home to urban music artists and when Keith got the, the role at that time of being president of this new you know magazine he reached out to me in Chicago [Illinois] and said hey man I, you know, got this opportunity to head up this new venture that Quincy Jones is involved in you know.  It's going to revolve around rap and hip hop and I got really excited about it you know because it was a void, you know, in the market place for a magazine like that.  He said I need somebody to, to head up our Chicago office, you know.  We don't even have one yet but we need someone.  He said I know you understand you know and know the advertising community there in Chicago.  Is this something that you might you know have an interest in?  But I will say oddly enough when he called me he first called to talk to my wife about the opportunity cause my wife [Karen] at the time was a salesperson for 'Essence' magazine and, but she really didn't have the same interest in music you know at the time.  So, you know I said well Keith you know I'm--let's talk.  What is this?  What is it?  Tell me more and one thing led to another and I ended up heading up the Chicago office for advertising sales and did that I think through 1998.
Speaker 1: So that the Midwest office--?
Speaker 2: Midwest yeah advertising sales director was my title.  We had phenomenal success with the magazine in the Midwest.  I had territory from, you know, Ohio to Denver, from you know Canada down to Texas calling on various agencies and on various clients, broke some of the larger accounts for the magazine like you know I broke the Anheuser-Busch business, I broke the P&G [Procter & Gamble] business, I broke some of the Philip Morris business for Altoids and things like that, broke the Miller business.  So we had some big wins of packaged good-like companies you know out of the Midwest.  I handled all of the relationships at Burrell [Communications Group] and all the relationships at the African American agencies in Chicago, broke the Luster Products business and the SoftSheen business.  We had quite a good run, quite a good run in Chicago office and left in 1998 to join TMP Worldwide which was--this was at the height of the internet craze.  And TMP is a parent company for Monster.com and worked with them to establish an executive search office in Chicago concentrating on entertainment and did that for two years.  And then the chairman of 'Vibe', Bob Miller gave me a call and asked me if I'd be interested in coming back to the magazine to head it up in this capacity responsible for you know all of our operations domestically you know, worldwide branding and all that type of stuff.  So that's what I began doing in 2000, packed up the family and moved from you know Chicago here to New York and that's what I continue to do.
Speaker 1: So you've been here ever since?
Speaker 2: Since 2000.
Story_ID: 7632
Speaker 1: You are now the president of--,
Speaker 2: President.
Speaker 1: --'Vibe' magazine and 'Vibe' magazine is the largest selling black magazine in the United States.  Is that true?
Speaker 2: Well, it's the largest selling black urban music magazine, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well I don't know.  I--are you sure it's not--and it sells more, I mean it has a circulation larger than 'Ebony', right?
Speaker 2: No, 'Ebony' still has a larger circulation.  'Essence' has a larger circulation.  We're 850,000 circulation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But from a revenue standpoint--,
Speaker 1: Well the revenues are higher.
Speaker 2: --we're more, I, what I've seen published, figures that I've seen show us as being you know the largest.  And I'm careful when we talk about African American because we're not African American-owned per se.  Quincy Jones has an economic stake in 'Vibe', you know.  Our partners, we have an equity partner Freeman Spogli, David Salzman so you know the majority of 'Vibe' is not owned by African Americans.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have a small stake as well but--.
Speaker 1: That is a distinction that people probably don't appreciate right?  I mean when they see it on the shelf they think it's a black magazine because it's--.
Speaker 2: Well the subject matter certainly, you know its essence is in the African American culture.  It is derived from the African American music.  But you know it is unlike 'Essence' in--well not even 'Essence' because 'Essence' now is 50 percent owned by Time Warner but it's unlike say an 'Ebony' or a 'Black Enterprise' in that it is not black owned.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  But your advertising revenue is higher than those magazines?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: I think of a little, I--we had a piece of research off the internet that showed a, I guess a bar graph with the 'Vibe' having I guess the highest advertising revenue and then--,
Speaker 2: Mh-hm.
Speaker 1: --'The Source', then 'Ebony', then 'Jet', then 'Essence'.  'Jet' and 'Essence' about the same level.
Speaker 2: That could be correct, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean that's what so--.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: I mean who knows it just came off the internet.
Speaker 2: Yeah that's, that's--.
Speaker 1: Does that seem pretty likely--,
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to be true?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it sounds accurate, yeah.
Story_ID: 7633
Speaker 1: So you're responsible for getting those ads really?  Well you were at one time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well my publisher for 'Vibe' is responsible primarily for advertising revenue sales and then we have marketing that plays a role in that and then we have the editorial creative side that plays a role obviously in creation of the editorial product.  And that's headed up by Mimi Valdés who is our editor in chief.
Speaker 1: But you coordinate those efforts?
Speaker 2: Yes, coordinate the efforts and everybody, working with everybody you know to make sure that the book gets out monthly and that the ad revenue comes in monthly.  So you know I spend an awful lot of time working with our larger advertisers.  I spend an awful lot of time working on our branding platforms, you know.  We have this year the second annual 'Vibe Awards' show which is on UPN and it's the only awards show with any type of ethnicity to it that's on a major network.  It's not on cable.  We reach the millions of household folks that we're reaching via UPN, very proud of that accomplishment.  And then I also executive produce our weekly segmentary show called 'Weekend Vibe' which is syndicated and we also have a presence with mobile technology via Vibe Mobile [sic, Mobile Vibe].  So via your cell phone you know, Verizon, AT&T, Cingular or Sprint you can subscribe to a Vibe mobile service.  We have a thriving website, web presence with you know a phenomenal number of unique paid views and things like that.  So you know it's gone from the core business of a magazine to having all of these other various you know multimedia platforms that we use and package to provide advertisers with the opportunity to reach a very elusive, young you know urban skewing demographic.
Speaker 1: Okay, now that's an urban demographic that is a coveted, you know, demographic.  I mean--.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Absolutely I mean you know because of what marketers have come to realize is that it's the urban, the young urban audience that are the trendsetters and the influencers, you know, for a much broader, American popular culture you know.  It's urban culture that drives America's popular culture whether it's in music, whether it's in the sports icons, whether it's fashion sensibility you know.  That's the power of the urban audience in influencing all of that.
Speaker 1: It's amazing to see that it--when you--to see it being acted out in countries you know as far flung as China and--.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --and you know Russia.
Speaker 2: I'm working on a deal right now to do a 'Vibe' Netherlands edition.  I have an opportunity to do a 'Vibe' South African edition and you know the next step is Russia and then China.  I mean the world, quite honestly, is craving all things urban and of course all things urban you know tend to, to have its roots to the African American experience. We define urban much more broadly in terms of you know being rooted in the African American experience which is shared by Latins and Asians and whoever else, people of color.  But that is a phenomena that the world craves.
Speaker 1: Now 'Vibe' started as a, you said it started as an idea of Quincy Jones--,
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --as a black music magazine basically.
Speaker 2: Correct.  Correct.
Speaker 1: Now how did it--was it a certain point it became more of, as an urban cultural magazine--they'll focus on music--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It doesn't--I don't think we, most people have the sense that 'Vibe' is a magazine that you want to read about jazz, you'd pick up 'Vibe', you know.
Speaker 2: Mh-hm.
Speaker 1: But you know--or you want to read about R&B.  But it's more of a hip hop, rap oriented magazine in terms of the music?
Speaker 2: Well yeah I mean the platform that we work off on, off of is much broader than just rap you know.  We can go from a Jay-Z cover to a Usher cover you know to 50 Cent cover and then back to a TLC cover, you know, to an R. Kelly cover.  We have that breadth of coverage in the magazine of taking from R&B and hip hop you know to gospel, you know, to reggae.  So we cover all things that are urban music, in the urban music experience.  Now one thing that is unique about our coverage though is that you know we tend to also touch on those cultural things so we may have a piece on, you know, what's going on in terms of political awareness you know particularly around election times.  We may have a story on athletes, you know.  But it's, usually it's all through the prism of music.  The fashion covers that we do I think is just phenomenal in terms of our ability when you turn to the page, through the pages of the magazine to see your high end, you know, couture brands, your Guccis, your Pradas, your Christian Diors, right next to your distinguished urban brands, you know Enyce, Phat Farm, Rocawear you know right next to advertisements for Mercedes Benz and Ford and Nissan, you know.  So I think finally marketers have accepted the idea, you know, that you know it's important to reach this illusive urban consumer.  This urban consumer really deems what's cool and what's not cool with regard to your product.  And if you don't talk to that urban consumer then you really are missing out on an opportunity to drive more sales of your product, you know.  So it's a conversation that we have often with marketers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In terms of your role as president, what do you think, I mean what's been your mark on 'Vibe' in terms of--cause you, when you came along they already been around for a few years anyway.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What mark have you have really made or been trying to make on 'Vibe'?
Speaker 2: Right.  Well my mark is most evident in just the profitability of the magazine.  We've had record advertising sales over the course of the time that I've been with the magazine.  I credit that to you know having a fantastic sales team that I have assembled with the new publisher.  We also have extended the brand as I mentioned before into television.  You know certainly one of my achievements was the facilitating of our and the consummating of our deal with CBS/UPN, you know, to produce the 'Vibe Awards' show.  The other deal was with weekend--Heritage Networks to produce the 'Weekend Vibe' television program.  So it's really been, you know, paving a way and making sure that the infrastructure is in place to make Vibe come alive through more than just the pages of a magazine.  Our deal to, you know, provide a mobile component to 'Vibe' you know our increased investment in our online capabilities.  All of those are things that have been you know initiatives from me in helping and growing and making sure that we nurture this brand so that it will continue to be around and it will serve as an educational tool as much as a marketing tool.  I often tell our staff the responsibility on us is great because I really see our role as being a window to the world on what urban culture is and the force that it is, you know.  So--.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You have--what is I guess, what do you see as the value of urban culture to the rest of the, I mean to I guess us here older people and the rest of the world in terms of what values are being espoused that you want to make sure are in 'Vibe'?
Speaker 2: Well I think that you know far too often you really only hear of some of the negative effects or the negative impact that urban culture you know has made, whether it's you know what some people say is a glorification of ghetto life or thug life or drug dealing or you know the misogyny of women, this and that.  There's no question that some of that exists in the lyrics and there is a responsibility on the part of the people, the artists you know and the video producers you know and the record labels you know to, to, to temper that you know for the ears of our children.  But I also think that there are some incredible stories of entrepreneurship and of creativity that have come from what we have come to, to know now as urban culture.  I mean look at, look at urban fashion.  Ten years ago you know brands like Phat Farm and Rocawear and Sean John didn't even exist and now that represents you know a billion dollar industry that was created from the sensibility, the aspirations and the creativity of people from the hip hop culture, you know.  And that can't be forgotten about.  It must be documented.  It must be celebrated.  Jobs are being created.  People are being given opportunities you know even for a place like 'Vibe', you know.  We are giving young people that want to be writers and that want to be photographers and that want to be advertising sales people you know the opportunity to learn you know the trade of publishing, magazine publishing.  And I think that that you know can't go you know undiscussed because that's very important.  Because if there weren't places like this, then where would so many of these young people that we employ you know learn this craft and, and learn and get the training?  And many of them go on, go on to you know larger, more mainstream publications like 'In Style' or 'Teen People' or 'Life' magazine.  We've had people leave 'Vibe' and go to other places and I'm very happy to see that because I know that if it weren't for an entry point like 'Vibe' they wouldn't get that, that opportunity.

Speaker 1: As you say like hip hop has been like a, has been like a, has generated a lot of entrepreneurship.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: In fact I think that's how it really got popular in the first place, people producing their own tapes and selling them first and then--.
Speaker 2: Right
Speaker 1: And becoming popular before the mainstream record producers went after them.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: They chased after the artists--,
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --in a sense.  We hear tales of people like--,
Speaker 2: Master P--.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --Ice T that abandoned the mainstream distribution networks--,
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and found their own networks, created their own markets you know grassroots market at its, at its best.
Speaker 1: Yeah, selling tapes out of the trunk of their cars and on the street corners and so forth.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And people like, people copying their tapes and selling 'em.
Speaker 2: Exactly, you know.  The bootleg part came with it as well.
Speaker 1: Yes, the--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All this entrepreneurship on the street level and--.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --which is a, because music is so, that music became so popular the record industry had to go after these people to try to, you know, bring them in you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Clothing and other things.  You see, you have millionaires being created out of this culture.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: In a way that hadn't been done before.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And that's something that's important.  Now there's a utilization of the other, of the music that came before--.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Story_ID: 7635
Speaker 1: We've had now over the past I guess, since hip hop I guess--what would you say is the beginning of the hip hop culture?  Because we talked about rap before but you said hip hop hadn't really started yet.  But what would you see is the beginning of hip hop culture and what are we really talking about when we're talking about hip hop culture I guess?
Speaker 2: Well from my perspective I see rap music as the music of hip hop culture.  When you think about a culture, a culture has its own unique language, its own unique ideology, its own unique art form, you know.  So when you talk about culture I think you see rap music as the music of what we now call the hip hop culture you know what I mean?  And I think that that's important because I think that is what speaks to the longevity of this hip hop culture you know.  It's the fact that you know there's a certain sensibility, there's a certain fashion sensibility, there's a certain you know music sensibility that, that people can attach to and say hey I'm a part of the hip hop culture.  You know that's a certain slang associated with it you know a certain mindset associated with it that, that gives it an appeal, a certain attitude, a certain swagger, certain self-determinism you know that's a part of it as well, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It seems to be--as I was looking through, when you flip through an issue of 'Vibe' I was flipping through one before we started and just noticed there seems to be a lot of references to the generation that came before.  There was an article about [actor] John Amos in one of them for instance.  There's articles about other--there was one article that, where we had Tupac [Shakur], well the, we had Tupac and Jay-Z and the brothers in Run DMC, you know.  It was like--,
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --DMC, Tupac and then Jay-Z.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know it's a chronology of where we are now as opposed to where we came from--,
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: --or where the music came from.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Is there a constant attempt, I mean do you all make a constant attempt to link generations in this magazine?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  I mean I think that that's part of editorially you know our, our, our responsibility, you know.  ['Vibe' owner] Quincy [Jones] often reminds us of our responsibility to educate you know our readers.  We don't want to dumb things down.  We want to provide stories that are, are number one interesting but then number two in some way serve to inform you know.  And we've done a number of stories over the years where there's stories on AIDS [Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome] , the AIDS epidemic in our community, stories on slavery in the Sudan.  I mean we've done a number of different types of stories that educate as well as entertain and probably not necessarily in that order they're probably more to entertain but then also educate.  But that's something that we are committed to journalistically because we feel that that's our responsibility.
Story_ID: 7636
Speaker 1: Hip hop as a culture has been written about a lot lately.  Bakari Kitwana who is an editor with '[The] Source' magazine, your chief rival, just wrote a, he--former editor of it anyway just wrote a book on hip hop culture ['The Hip Hop Generation'] and appeared on public radio discussing you know where hip hop is going, where it came from.  And what's your take on some of the discussion on hip hop these days?
Speaker 2: Well I think that hip hop, you know, it's hard to define where it's going because I think we've seen over the rich you know twenty-five year evolution of the culture that it really is, is, is only a microcosm of the struggle of the people in the streets, right?  I mean that's where it came from.  It was the voices of the underclass so to speak, you know.  From a, as a music form, okay let's look at it.  It came from you know people, folks up in the Bronx [New York, New York] in the '70s [1970s] right, who scratched with turntables and records you know as a form of, of entertainment and created, it came from a creative spirit, right?  Nobody told them that if you scratch the music like that, that you know I guarantee you that that's going to turn into a multimillion dollar business.  It was their creativity and lack of resources so to speak that someone decided to play around with that, you know.  The fashion sensibility, you know, is not taken from the, the runways of Milan [Italy] and couture salons it's the other way around. It's inspired by what people are wearing in the streets, you know.  So it's kind of hard for me to say where it's going except to say that it will come from the streets.  It will come from that creative spirit, you know, that has, has given us what it's given us thus far.  I don't think that it's, it's, it's going anywhere meaning that it will disappear.  I think that it will continue to evolve.  I think the music will change.  Each generation has its own way of self expression you know via music and that's guaranteed.  We've seen that since the beginning of music in America you know.  But the interesting thing about that is that it has always had its roots in the African American struggle.  Whether you go back to blues and then jazz and rock and roll, it has always emanated from the African American musical experience and I think, that I can certainly predict without question.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now there certainly seems to be a universal entertainment value to some of the music.  But, do you see, especially someone who is raised by educators and in an environment where you do a lot of study and reflection on how to relate to different kinds of people and that sort of thing.  Do you--are you ever troubled by some of the product of hip-hop music?  I know it's all different kinds of expression but--.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Absolutely, sometimes I am.  Sometimes I am and sometimes I think that there should be a greater level of accountability, you know, with some of the artists with regard to you know--but I also think that, you know I don't believe in censorship either.  I think that that's one of the things that makes this country great.  I think there has to be a collective, you know, kind of, I don't want to say policing but set of standards that are imposed you know.  And I think that that would occur or really occurs you know as hip hop matures.  When you look at the fashion sensibility of hip hop culture right now you know it's not necessarily any longer about the baggy pants and the retro jerseys, not at the cutting edge.  It's about tailored suits and striped shirts.  You know hip hop is growing up.  The sensibility of many of the people at the forefront you know the Russell Simmons of the world, the Puffys [Sean Combs] of the world, you know who are icons so to speak from a fashion standpoint.  There's more of a concern with other you know life things you know.  You know whether that's investing you know or whether that's you know providing for your family and your kids you know and I think that's interesting to see.  It's very interesting to see and I think it's encouraging to see.
Story_ID: 7637
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community in general?
Speaker 2: Well one of my biggest hopes and concerns lies in the area of participation, the political process.  I think that participation in the political process is going to be what allows us to empower ourselves.  I think that you know economic empowerment in the black community is a topic that's been discussed for so long and I think that, you know, with second and third generations you know of educated people you know, and even prior to that it was never for lack of desire for us not to be empowered.  I think that you know now you know it's imperative that you know we continue to struggle for that type of empowerment.  And I think a way to do that is through broader participation in the political process because it's through the political process that agendas are set.  It's through the political process, you know, that we do have a voice to determine property taxes, district and redistricting of school zones you know.  Who will represent us, who will be our voice.  And, you know, my concern and, and, but hope is that you know we will embrace that more.  Another concern that I have has to do with our ability to have more voices available to us via the media.  I think it's great that we have a BET [Black Entertainment Television].  I think it's great that we have a TV One.  I think we need two or three other outlets for creativity and for discussion of issues.  I think we can't be content with the consolidation that we see of our radio stations and the consolidation that we see in our magazine.  I think we need more voices you know because the more voices we have you know the more that we can ensure that, that, that there's discussion and dialogue in the community about how these agendas are set.
Story_ID: 7638
Speaker 1: In terms of politics I know recently there's been some organizational efforts on the part of hip hop so-called moguls--,
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and artists to register young people to vote.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Young people in urban neighborhoods to vote right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Have you been a part of any of those efforts?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, I have and the magazine ['Vibe'] has and I think that it's important that we do.  And I applaud those leaders for taking the initiative to get people involved in the process because yeah I think it's a responsibility that we have.  We know how powerful these moguls/icons have been in selling records and in selling clothes and in selling gym shoes.  Well let's sell, you know, these young people on what is not the dream but the reality okay, of, of casting their vote, self determining you know how their lives are going to be affected, you know bringing value and having them understand the value and the lives that were lost to afford them the opportunity to vote, you know.  And if we can make anything cool we should be making it and be about the business of making participation in this political process cool.  We can't afford not to.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, I know Russell Simmons has been really involved in funding political, I mean political education around this coming election, you know.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm. Sure.
Speaker 1: And quite a few others.
Story_ID: 7639
Speaker 1: In terms of material culture, it seems to me and, and I'm being you know much older than you and looking at this, it seems to me that when hip hop culture first came into the world as you said earlier, people in the street were wearing like baggy clothes, work clothes, gym shoes. There seemed to be an emphasis on casual wear rather than you know buying real expensive stuff.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: But then you know when the commercial world caught up with it they started like selling this stuff back to the kids in the street--,
Speaker 2: Mm-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: --as these are the gym shoes you have to buy.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: These are the baggy jeans you got to get this is, you know you got to get this.  And seems like we really have a material culture crisis that's just as bad as it was in the '70s [1970s] when people were buying platform shoes and other, you know it doesn't seem like it's much different.  The commercial world has caught up with the--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --hip hop world.  I mean for a long time.  It's been going for a long time now.
Speaker 2: Sure, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Where you got the same--do you ever feel as someone trying to sell a magazine ['Vibe'] and you know you ever feel like--and having gone, having had the experiences that you had in Williams College [Williamstown, Massachusetts] and other places where you see how rich people really live, it doesn't really seem to be quite as extravagant at least on that level as we are, though maybe more extravagant on another level, I don't know.
Speaker 2: Sure.  Sure.
Speaker 1: How do you, what are your thoughts about that?  Do you ever think about that?
Speaker 2: I do, but you know it is, it's consumerism, it's capitalism in America, you know.  One of the reasons that hip hop is as big as it is, is that hip hop and hip hop culture is big business.  You know like I mentioned before you had the creation of a billion dollar industry that didn't even exist ten years ago, that being urban fashion, you know.  You have the record companies who have cashed in to the tunes of billions of dollars, you know, based upon you know this, this genre of music.  You have a, a sensibility that's very much driven by brand and badge value, you know.  That's another part of the whole hip hop culture that we talked, when I talked a bit about ideologies you know, consumerism is a huge you know ideological platform within hip hop culture.  It's about your badge value you know.  It's about that, that, the brand of that shoe that you're wearing.  It's about the brand of that shirt that you have on, you know.  It's about the brand value that you associate with that car that you're driving because I saw that car in a video, you know, or I've seen those shoes in a video or you know this sports icon who is of the hip hop culture has a hip-hop sensibility you know wears that, that watch, you know.  So I think that the two are somewhat inseparable, you know consumerism, strong brand identity, capitalism all are a part of the mix when it comes to hip hop.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It really is a part of the fabric.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you think that, do you think that the future, that there's really like substantial economic growth that's going to come out of this, the hip-hop movement now?  You know we have are some millionaires that have been developed somewhat but in terms of big money do you think somebody, we're really going to--is this an opportunity to really you know get a hold of an industry I guess in a way that's saying I know that people well they--for black folks to get a hold of an industry I mean you know some essential industry in this country?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Because I think that's, that's one of the things I think that we talk about amongst ourselves and we bemoan the fact we really don't control an industry, anything that really need, you know, food or oil--,
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --or heavy industry.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: We don't manufacture cars.  Is this, is this--do you think this is something we can really get some control--is the hip hop movement demonstrating how they control some of this?
Speaker 2: No I don't really think so.  I think it's past that, you know.  I think that because of the hip hop culture being a shared experience by folks that are not even necessarily of you know the African American culture.  We're far beyond that you know.  I think that--no I don't think that, that this is something. But we do know you know that this is a multimillion, million if not billion dollar you know business that people have tapped into.  Look at the Reeboks of the world.  Look at the Nikes of the world.  They certainly you know have profited handsomely from that.  Now what I suggest that we do you know when we talk about economic empowerment and this and that is to educate these young African Americans about how they can benefit from the sale of those shoes to people in their community.  How do you do that?  Well you go out and buy Nike stock, right?  We have to educate our, these younger individuals about the power of investment, the power of compounded interest, right?  And, you know, so that yes we can benefit individually and as a part of the community, right?  I think that that's the way that, that we somehow begin to level the playing field so that we aren't just exporting everything but that we are benefited from the long term investments.  Once again you become an investor in a company like Nike.  You get enough shares and pretty soon you begin to set the agenda, right?  You can then have a voice you know in the say of their marketing strategies.  But you, you got to buy into it you know and not just Nike but that's a very visible, you know, company that you know has made millions and if not billions of dollars, you know in targeting and talking to our audience.
Speaker 1: I know a few years ago Michael Jordan was criticized for the fact that Air Jordans [Nike basketball shoes] were being made in Indonesia or some place.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know in a real--by people that really weren't being paid any money.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: He didn't seem to even know it you know.
Speaker 2: Mh-hmm.
Speaker 1: And he was challenged to do something about it and I don't, I think he said he would but I don't, I don't think there's any evidence he ever did.  But--,
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --are we becoming, do you think we're becoming more sophisticated around these issues than we used to be or--?
Speaker 2: Well I think we certainly are. I think that you're seeing more and more of these millionaires, you know, that profited from playing ball or the movies or whatever, you know, begin to demand more ownership in some of these companies that come to them and want to do licensing deals with them, that want to you know parlay their high visibility and their connectedness to the community.  I think you definitely are seeing that.  Look at Russell Simmons alone, you know.  He's in a financial services business.  He had his debit card business.  He's in the technology business through his partnerships with Motorola and the Baby Phat phone you know.  He's in the clothing business with Kellwood, you know, as his partner and he's been able to effect change you know through his involvement in all of these businesses.  And I think that's the model, you know that, that more folks like--look at Magic Johnson you know what Magic Johnson was doing in the urban areas you know in the Chicago [Illinois] and L.A. [Los Angeles, California] with the Magic Johnson Theaters, with his deals with Starbucks, bringing Starbucks into the African American community you know.  And he's not just like the used car salesman you know where he's getting a dealership.  I mean my impression and understanding in conversations revolve around him and what he's doing actually impact, you know, these strategic decisions that these larger companies are making with regard to how they're talk in our and work in our communities and providing jobs in our communities, you know, or not, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well what's your vision for--what would you like to see happen on this front in the next few years?
Speaker 2: Well I'd like to see you know like I mentioned before I certainly would like to see more participation in the political process.  I'd like to see more of a financial stake being held, you know, by individuals that are around this culture of hip hop, you know, have a little more vested economic stake in it.  And you know I really would like to believe that, that 'Vibe' can continue to be a brand that's recognized for you know journalistic integrity and professionalism and that it will be a brand that will maintain and endure.
Story_ID: 7640
Speaker 1: When you look back on what you've done so far and you're still young you know, what do you consider to be your legacy at this point?
Speaker 2: You know I consider my legacy honestly to be my two small children that I'm raising and hopefully making a positive impact, you know, in terms of a roll model to them.  Like I said if I can play a role in ensuring that a brand like 'Vibe' is around and set it up with a very strong foundation to sustain itself, that would make me happy as well.  But the legacy that I want to leave has nothing really to do with, with business and nothing really to do with any of these more material things. I think it's really much more my you know commitment to, to my children and my family.  And hopefully you know securing a way for them such as they can have you know the means available to have education and things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And would you do anything differently, anything major if you had it to do again?
Speaker 2: Absolutely not.  Absolutely not I've been fortunate and blessed in that regard and I don't have any regrets for decisions that I've made you know business wise or you know personally.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I know your mother [Annette Ames] didn't live to see you become successful like this but what does your father [Solomon Eugene Gibbs]  think about it?
Speaker 2: I think he's proud.  I think he you know as I mentioned before if there's anyone that was a shining example for me as to the acceptance of responsibility you know it was him.  So you know in so many ways I feel like whatever it is that I'm achieving you know it's really just a testament to his, his raising of me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And one last question similar to legacy but not quite the same.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered as someone that cared a great deal about people, that tried to impact positive change, that tried to most importantly be a good father and be a good husband and you know secondarily, tertiary you know was, was a, a good business person.
