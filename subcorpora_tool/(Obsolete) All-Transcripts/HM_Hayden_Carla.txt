Speaker 2: I'm currently the chief executive officer of the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore, Maryland.
Speaker 1: And the former head of--
Speaker 2: I'm the former, or the past president of the American Library Association [ALA].  And I am currently a member of the Institute of Museum and Library Services [IMLS] board, and that's the federal agency that gives out funds to museums and libraries throughout the country.

Speaker 1: All right, now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight, People magazine-ish type questions that management compels me to ask of everyone, and they only require a short answer.  The first question is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: What is it?
Speaker 2: The all-time favorite is chocolate ice cream.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color is blue.
Speaker 1: All right, and do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Summertime.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Paris, France.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes, "Living well is the best revenge."
Speaker 1: Is there an origin for that (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yes.  When you've had different things happen in your life, and you look back on things, and I've discovered that Oscar Wilde actually said that, but he wasn't the originator of the phrase, but he said it during his trials and tribulations.  And it just really struck me.  And so over the years, it's been something that's been very helpful to remember (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, all right.
Speaker 2: --and think about, and really enjoy.
Story_ID: 245679
Speaker 1: Well, what's her [Hayden's mother, Colleen Dowling Hayden] date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born October 10th, and she was born in Helena, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Okay, you have a year?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you--this is oral history, so that's why we do it.  How far back can you trace (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it's, sure, on my mother's side of the family, I mentioned Helena, Arkansas.  And she was the daughter of Zelia [Dowling], and that's Z-E-L-I-A, and Jerry Dowling.  So you get the name in there, D-O-W-L-I-N-G.
Story_ID: 245680
Speaker 1: Jerry Dowling [Hayden's maternal grandfather] was a farmer.  And he was given the farm by his white father, which was interesting.  So it was one of those kind of biracial families.  And it was very interesting because he had the farm.  It was right outside of Helena [Arkansas], and he grew peanuts and different types of crops.  And then they had a house in town, and that's Helena.  And so there was the commuting back and forth.  And then the family, part of the family moved up to Champaign, Illinois.  It was following that migration that was happening with African Americans at that time.
Speaker 2: So where were they--they were in Helena first, okay.
Speaker 1: Helena, Arkansas.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And like other African American families, and the history of the time, there was movement along the railroad, and so there's a railroad line that goes from that part of the South all the way up through Illinois to Chicago [Illinois].  And, in fact, it still exists today.  And so my grandfather worked part time on the railroad, and that--and people would settle where the railroad section that they were working on finished.  And so the, his uncle or something had settled in Champaign, and so the family eventually made it to Champaign, Illinois.  And so then--
Speaker 2: Okay, did he continue to work for the railroad?
Speaker 1: No, no, that was temporary.  He went back to the farm, but there was still that connection with his uncle and things like that.
Speaker 2: And, now, there are quite a few people from Chicago that have roots in Helena, Arkansas (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, they do.
Speaker 2: --the Strogers and--
Speaker 1: Yes, they were friends--the Strogers were actually friends of my grandparents.  And they knew each other.  And so those families knew each other quite well.  The--my mother's [Colleen Dowling Hayden] brothers were friends with [HistoryMaker] John [H.] Stroger [Jr.].
Speaker 2: Okay.  And there was quite a few--yeah, Helena is a big town in Chicago (laughter).
Speaker 1: And there's still that connection between the people that lived in Helena and in Champaign and--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and Chicago.  And so that's, that railroad connection is there.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, are there any stories that, in your family, that are passed down from the 19th century from the slavery period or is your, was your grand (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) On my father's [Bruce Hayden, Jr.] side--
Speaker 2: Well, we'll wait for that and get to him until we--well, just on--
Speaker 1: Oh, sure, sure.
Speaker 2: --your mother's side right now.
Speaker 1: Well, when you said, passed down from slavery--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--
Speaker 1: --side, that's where they're passed down, on my--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --father's side.
Speaker 2: Well, we'll talk about that when we--
Speaker 1: On my mom's side, in terms of slavery, there aren't as many stories that took place in slavery.  There's stories that took place right afterwards with the--my grandmother's [Zelia Dowling] first husband was a steamboat operator along the Mississippi [River], and so that was really interesting, and her oldest child--
Speaker 2: Now, this is a black man that's operating the steamboat?
Speaker 1: No, he was white.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So it was interesting because she actually married a white man.
Speaker 2: Okay, and then she went (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And I think having, being able to do that on that river probably helped (laughter) because there were a lot of laws against black and white marrying, so.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's interesting.
Speaker 1: And then he died, and then they came ashore basically, and then she had this young daughter.  And then she met Jerry Dowling--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: --down in the Helena area.
Speaker 2: And his father was white?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So there was a--that wasn't that unusual, I guess, in those times, yeah, the commingling.
Speaker 2: Right, it's just--a lot of times you can't trace it.
Speaker 1: Well, you can't trace some parts, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, sometimes, it's hard to trace.
Speaker 1: --and some people didn't because my grandfather's sister, Jerry Dowling's sister, actually decided to become, pass as white.  And so the family lost touch with her, Annie [ph.], just never saw her again.
Story_ID: 245681
Speaker 1: So your mother [Colleen Dowling Hayden], did she basically grow up in Champaign [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she went to grammar school there and high school there, and then she went to college in Millikin, at Millikin [University, Decatur, Illinois].  It's a small liberal arts college in Decatur, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: M-I-L-L-I-K-E-N [sic.], and that's where she really started to have a relationship with my father [Bruce Hayden, Jr.], who was also attending Millikin.  But they had met during the years before.
Speaker 1: Okay, but, okay, now, I'm gonna ask about your father in a second, but are there any other stories that, growing up that your mother told you before--you know, that lead, that precede her going to college?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, in fact, there're stories in Helena [Arkansas].  There're stories in Helena and the levee breaking and all those types of things.
Speaker 1: What happened?  What happened with the levee?
Speaker 2: Well, with--there--I mentioned the farm, and it was surrounded by water, it sounds like.  It was like a island.  There were several little islands, so actually the farm was on that.  And there were levees around there.  And one time the levee broke, and so water caused everyone to leave.  And then there also was a fire in the--they called it the hollow.  It was the black section of Helena.  It was called the hollow.  And there was a fire there, and that's where that connection with the Stroger family came in because my grandmother [Zelia Dowling] helped take the children out of the Stroger house.  You know, they were--because the fire was in the hollow and the different families were helping each other and things like that.  So there was that connection with Mr. Stroger's mother [Ella Jones Stroger] and my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's quite a connection, how they got (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, that's the close one (laughter).  And then because of the farm, my mother's family would have fresh vegetables and would have a lot of things.  And so they would give them to the different families and they would have chickens, and they would have that.  So they were always able to provide food to other families in the community.  So that was interesting.  And she remembers--and they, and all of her siblings and my mother, to this day, loves peanuts and roasted nuts.  And she talks about how they would--that was their snack, you know.  So they were pretty healthy when you think about it (laughter), I mean if that's what they had to, you know, nuts and different types of things that, for snacks and that.
Story_ID: 245682
Speaker 1: Give me your father's full name and spell it for us.
Speaker 2: Bruce Kennard Hayden [Jr.].
Speaker 1: And the middle name (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And we'll get back to Champaign [Illinois] too with the garage too, and the black business thing too--
Speaker 1: Oh, the--
Speaker 2: We'll get to my mother's [Colleen Dowling Hayden] family too.
Speaker 1: This is your mother's family.
Speaker 2: Yeah, when they get to Champaign.  That was the interesting part too--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And Bruce Kennard, how do you spell Kennard--
Speaker 2: Hayden, H-A-Y-D-E-N, oh, Kennard?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: K-E-N-N-A-R-D, Hayden, and he was a junior.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born June 22nd, and it was in the '30s [1930s].  I can't remember the exact.
Speaker 1: In the 1930s?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He's dead now.  I mean he--yeah, it was like '33 [1933] or--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: But I'm not sure.  So I need to get that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, well, what can you tell us about your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well, that was a very interesting side.  His mother [Myrtle Holmes Hayden] came from a family in downstate Illinois that was written about by Ruby Berkley Goodwin, and she wrote a book in 1954.  I believe it's called 'It's Good to be Black,' and in 1954, that was quite a title.  And it was published by Southern Illinois University Press [Carbondale, Illinois].  It's being republished again.  And on the front, it has a heart with the silhouette of a black person.  And she--and basically, it was about my grandmother's family in southern Illinois, and their experiences.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, who wrote this now?
Speaker 2: Ruby Goodwin.
Speaker 1: Ruby Goodwin.
Speaker 2: And she was the, like the personal assistant to Hattie McDaniel.  So in the books about Hattie McDaniel, you will see the name, and you will see references to Ruby Goodwin, G-O-D-D--G-O-O-D-W-I-N.
Speaker 1: And Hattie McDaniel, the famous Oscar-winning actress (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: --of--from 'Gone With the Wind,' yeah--
Speaker 2: Because Ruby moved out, Ruby moved out to California.  She was a writer, and she was into different things, and she became the personal assistant for Hattie McDaniel.
Speaker 1: So what's the name of the town?
Speaker 2: I think that helped--now, the town that all this takes place is called Du Quoin, Illinois.
Speaker 1: You gotta spell that one.
Speaker 2: I know (laughter).  D-U-Q-U-I-O-N [sic.], Du Quoin, Illinois.  And it's not far from Carbondale, Illinois where the university [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] is situated.  And so it's kind of south.  If you've heard of Cairo, Illinois--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and southern parts of Illinois, they're very southern.  And so there was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and like you said, it's a very southern part of the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and this family was the Holmes family, H-O-L-M-E-S.  There were sisters and brothers and they had a number of ministers.  And they were pretty much a family that was known in the community.
Speaker 1: This is your grandmother's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My grandmother's family, right.
Speaker 1: --family.  Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And they were also very musical.  And so they would have impromptu concerts.  And all of them played some type of instrument.  And that was part of it too.  And so the Holmes family--so this is all in that book too that she talks about that--
Story_ID: 245683
Speaker 1: Does this tradition go back to slavery days or to the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Probably, it does.  And my grandmother's mother was from a family, and his name was Lott, L-O-T-T.  That family was also involved in education and religion, and so--and she would call him--Grandpa Lott was a minister.  And so was Grandpa Holmes on her father's side.  And her earliest memory of Grandpa Lott, who read everything--so I guess that's where the tradition of reading comes in for me in life.  That's kind of fun now.  Her earliest memory of him is trying to paint the house.  They had several big houses, a lot of them, and with the paint brush in in one hand and a book in the other.  And he didn't get much done.  He wasn't a real practical guy (laughter), but, you know, that was that and he had to read.  And that was her earliest memory of him.  She also, one of her great aunts, she would tell me the story that she was a slave to a lady who--when she was about twelve.  And she was brushing the lady's hair, and the lady wasn't that pleased with how she was brushing it.  And so she took the brush out of her hand and hit her hand with it, and she was deformed because they didn't--it was broken and things.  And so, as a young child, my grandmother would ask her aunt so and so, about, you know, why is your hand like that, like children do.  And she would, she told her about that instance.  So that's where I--when I mentioned the slavery part comes more on that side of memories and things that were handed down.
Speaker 1: So the memories of slavery are not very pleasant, I guess?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: You know, I do that for the sake of history, 'cause some people still claim that it wasn't that bad.
Speaker 2: No.  I think it's interesting when you think of pleasant memories in slavery, a lot of them have to do with maybe acts of kindness, unexpected acts of kindness or mercy that people were given.  If there's anything pleasant, that--and it's usually a surprise or something that someone would act in a pleasant way.  That seems to be what I've gathered from the history and even personal experiences that--
Speaker 1: Okay, so your mother [Colleen Dowling Hayden] heard a lot of--I mean your father [Bruce Hayden, Jr.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My grandmother, yeah, my grandmother--
Speaker 1: Your grandmother, so your grandmother told these stories directly from--
Speaker 2: To me, and, yeah, yeah, and it was, she was, she loved history, and she loved to read, and she really was very, I think, concerned that these stories were passed on too.
Speaker 1: Now, did your grandmother have a chance to go to school and--
Speaker 2: Yes, she got a chance to go to school, and she finished high school.  And back in those days, that was pretty good.  She was going to go to college, but then she met my grandfather [Bruce Hayden, Sr.].  And that created a little concern in the family because she wanted to get married, but--and he also was a man who had been married before and had a young child, a young daughter.  And his wife had died.  So, but they did get married, and my grandmother raised that young daughter as her own.  I think Ruth [ph.] was about--there's another Ruth.  They have Ruths on both sides.  I think she was about four or five when they got married.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what's your grandmother's name that told these stories?
Speaker 2: Oh, Myrtle.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Myrtle Theodora Holmes Hayden.  And she was named Theodora after her grandfather, Theodore Lott.  That's the Pastor Lott.  And she hated her name, Myrtle.  Myrtle is not quite a lively name today (laughter).  So she hated her--but it was--Myrtle means evergreen, and she never quite liked it, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --she was Myrtle.
Speaker 1: And she told the family stories and passed down to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, she did--
Speaker 1: Yeah, do you have a sense of where she was born?
Speaker 2: I know the date.  She was born August the 8th.  And she was born August the 8th.  I was born August the 10th, and my grandfather, her husband, was born August 14th.  So when I would visit in the summers, August was the--that's why summer's my favorite time, 'cause I would visit them in Springfield, Illinois.  And so birthday time was a great time because we all had our birthdays together.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, and about how old was she when she passed away?
Speaker 2: She was eighty-nine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she passed away in 1991.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she was born right after the turn of the century, I guess?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Nineteen oh--[1902] yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 245684
Speaker 1: Your father [Bruce Hayden, Jr.], I know your father was a musician (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --and celebrated in Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: There's a theater [Bruce K. Hayden Center for the Performing Arts, Chicago, Illinois] named for him and everything.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Tell us about how he grew up and what his stories of growing ip--
Speaker 2: Well, he has a interesting background because the--his father, my grandfather [Bruce Hayden, Sr.]--that was the gentleman with the young daughter.  And the family was kind of, "Oh, my," (laughter) you know.  Here's this mature man.  But he was, worked for the postal system, the U.S. postal system, and he was assigned to Tuscola, Illinois.  That's another small town.  All this is happening in Illinois.  And the population of Tuscola was about ten thousand.  And my father's--and so he was the postman for this town, Tuscola.  And that's where my dad was born, in Tuscola.  And they were the only black family in that town because the postman was the black, that was the black person.
Speaker 1: Can you spell Tuscola for me?
Speaker 2: T-U-S-C-O-L-A.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Tuscola, Illinois.  And it's only about twenty miles from Champaign, Illinois.  So that's where the story of my mom [Colleen Dowling Hayden] and Champaign, and they get together later on comes in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So my dad grew up the only black kid in this town in middle Illinois 'cause it's not as south as Du Quoin [Illinois] and the things like that.  And when he got to high school age, it became apparent that with the times, it was not good for him to start with the dating and all of that in that town.  And they moved to Springfield, Illinois where there was a larger black population.  And he always had some--that's when he really became aware of the entire racial thing because the--here were kids that he had grown up with all his life, all of that.  And there weren't many differences at first or that were apparent until he got to puberty.  And that's when things were tense.  He wasn't quite understanding it.  He had to be told, and then they moved to Springfield, Illinois.
Speaker 1: That's a story that Marcus Garvey tells.  There's a whole lot of people that tell that kind of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --kind of similar story.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That's when the--
Speaker 2: It's universal.  It's okay (laughter) as long as they're little kids, but when they get to the mating and that age, and everything, and it really stuck with him.  And what, that is--and one of the things that I really got from him was that you judge everybody on what they do and say, and not their appearance--
Story_ID: 245685
Speaker 1: --He [Hayden's father, Bruce Hayden, Jr.] was very much--maybe that goes into his whole music too, and that where sometimes in the music world, it's your talent that matters.  When, when real musicians play together, it's--if somebody's talented and that, they accept them because that's the currency, and that's the--what it is.  And he really loved the jazz part of music, and that, because that seemed to be more prevalent.  It wasn't that way with the classical music that he was trained in.  And so he was not able in the '50s [1950s] to--because he was a concert violinist, and he was trained as a classical violinist, he was not able to get into any symphony orchestras though.  So he ended up teaching and things like that, but he was not able to be part of a symphony.
Speaker 2: But in popular music and jazz, in those days (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was easier because, well, I think black people were able to cross different boundaries and things in the jazz world.  And he just liked it too because it was freer and things like that.  But he was definitely that, and then my mother [Colleen Dowling Hayden]--and so music was in his family from generations.  His great-grandmother and his grandmother taught piano and things like that.  That whole musical side that I mentioned was very prevalent.  I have two cousins that are teaching music in universities right now.  So I didn't get the talent.  That's why I'm sitting here as a librarian (laughter).  It skipped, but I have quite a few cousins and things that are taught and so music on that side of the family is big.  But in his case, he was pretty exceptionally talented.  He had perfect pitch.  He, you know, for that, played a number of string instruments and clarinet was his first instrument.  So he was very, very talented in that sense (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, so he was at Millikin College [Millikin University, Decatur, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: He was in Millikin, because Millikin, for a small school, it had a very strong music department.  And he was giving concerts around the Illinois area anyway, and in church.  The church was a big part of their lives.  They were Baptists and my mother's family is Baptist.  And so my mother on the other hand, parallel to that, was showing talent with the piano.  And she was one of the only people in her family and her side that had that.  They'd tell stories of her being three or four and she would sit on the steps and play like she was playing on the--play the steps like a piano.  And her mother [Zelia Dowling] said, "We've gotta get her lessons."  And so they put money together to get lessons for her.  So on the parallel side, my mom is having lessons.  She's playing the piano, and she's doing this.  And she gets a scholarship to go to Millikin for music.  And they had seen each other in the concert settings with churches before, you know, 'cause he was the bright guy from Springfield [Illinois], this, playing the violin, and she was the young lady playing the piano.  And they knew each other and things like that--
Story_ID: 245686
Speaker 1: So here we are.  They're [Hayden's parents, Colleen Dowling Hayden and Bruce Hayden, Jr.] both at Millikin [University, Decatur, Illinois] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They're in Millikin, and there you go.
Speaker 1: They have seen each other.  They knew each other by reputation--
Speaker 2: Oh, they knew, and it was kind of, yeah, there's that smart guy over there with the violin.  And she's the belle of the ball of Champaign [Illinois] and that kinda thing.  But then they--
Speaker 1: So what's the story that they tell about how they actually met and started becoming interested in each other?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, because they were both the stars.  And they were pretty decent looking, you know, so there was that.  And then they both realized that they were really good.  She was one of the top with the piano, and he was really top--and he needed an accompanist.  And there still was--they weren't able to live on campus.  They had to live with black families in town because there were no accommodations for black students.  And he was several years ahead of her.  And he went into the master's program for music there.  And that's when he had to do concerts and things like that.  And he really needed an accompanist.  And so then she became his accompanist.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I imagine there weren't very many black students there either at Millikin?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, they all knew each other, and they still know each other.  I think there were about ten she said, total, in every department.  And they all knew each other, and they still--a few of them that are still living keep in contact--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which is interesting.  And so what they would do is tour the black, historically black colleges [HBCUs] too.  They would go to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and things, concerts and give, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So then they got married, and then--
Speaker 1: About what time is this?  About what year is this?
Speaker 2: Early '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: In the early '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: Early '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so then he got a position at Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  And they had a strong music department there.  And people may remember the marching band.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was the band that revolutionized (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All that, right--
Speaker 1: --marching bands--
Speaker 2: --right.  And so my dad was hired for the music department there.  And several--
Speaker 1: That's Dr. (unclear)--
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [William] Foster.
Speaker 1: Dr. Foster, right.
Speaker 2: And so I was born in Tallahassee, Florida.  And he was teaching at Florida A&M.  And my mom got a job teaching in the school system there, teaching music in the school system.  And so my earliest memories are of the band, basically, practicing 'cause they had faculty housing.  And it--where we were was right near the field where the band would practice and things.  And then I got to be the mascot on some of the--on the floats, you know, and they would have the parades and things.  And I was like three or four.  And, so he worked with the band, and he also did all the string instruments.  So when you look in the yearbooks and stuff, you'll see him as faculty at Florida A&M.  So those were nice memories.  I also remember all the ants, getting into ant hills and things in Florida.
Story_ID: 245687
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' [Colleen Dowling Hayden and Bruce Hayden, Jr.] talents and their dispositions, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I think I'm a pretty good combination of both.  And one side is more dominant most of the time, but then that other side comes out (laughter).  And sometimes at work, I think they can tell which side is coming out.  My mom's side is the more feisty side, and scrappy and like that.  And my dad was very, almost Zen-like with the music, and accepting everyone, and everything's fine, and that type of thing.  And usually I'm on that side, but sometimes that other side comes out.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you don't--do you have any siblings?
Speaker 2: Yes, my dad--my parents divorced when I was ten.  And we were in New York [New York] because he had left Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] to go with Nat [Adderley] and Cannonball Adderley who were from Tallahassee [Florida], and went to school there.  And he joined their combo there, their band.  And so he was part of that group with Cannonball Adderley, and they all moved to--we all moved to New York.  And that's where he played with, like Miles Davis and people like that.  Those were good memories too, but they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so--
Speaker 2: --divorced when, when we were in New York, when I was ten--
Speaker 1: Okay, so they moved--he went with Cannonball Adderley first to New York--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we--
Speaker 1: --before they divorced.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  And I think New York at that time with the jazz and that for a young lady from Champaign [Illinois] who was a classical pianist and had only been to Tallahassee, in that setting, my mom--it was quite a culture shock for her.  And she tells a lot of stories about that time in New York and the jazz scene and just how hard it was because she was working.  And she got into the housing department there and was working.  But, you know, they were jazz musicians, so they were practicing during the day and playing at night.  And there were a lot of tensions.
Speaker 1: Now, there's a story in this too about the opportunities for women in music, I guess, on some level, 'cause your mother was a prodigy too--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --but she--
Speaker 2: That definitely, I mean she could basically, what women at that time could do was teach.  And she, because she had her undergraduate degree in music, later she got her master's [degree] in music.  But that was like fifteen or so years later.  So to teach in a university, she would have, at that time, she would have at least have had to have a master's degree.  And she didn't have that 'cause she had me and she went into that.  So she could only teach like in high school or grammar school, teach music in that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I think that she liked that, but not as much, I think, as the performing and doing that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she wasn't a real good person with jazz.
Speaker 1: Okay.  She didn't have an affinity for it?
Speaker 2: No, she still doesn't (laughter).  She likes gospel.  She can play gospel piano and everything.  But jazz, she never really--I don't think that just the--she was very classically trained.  And so it's very hard for her even now to loosen up with that.  So she actually took lessons in--she played in the church, but it--her church at that time was playing anthems and things that were sort of classical anthems, you know, they weren't just freeform.  And so years later, she took lessons in playing gospel piano and still listens to it.

Speaker 1: About how old were you when your parents [Colleen Dowling Hayden and Bruce Hayden, Jr.] moved to New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: I was five.
Speaker 1: Five, okay.
Speaker 2: So from the time I was five to the time I was ten, we were in New York.  And I went to P.S. 96 [Jamaica Public School 96, Queens, New York, New York] and I loved New York.  I still love New York.  As a child in growing up in New York the candy stores and just--there's a energy there that was very, very (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, what neighborhood in New York did you live in?
Speaker 2: Queens [New York, New York], we were in Jamaica.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so do you remember much about the musicians and the--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  It was, in fact, my favorite was Miles Davis and that, and, my mom said she knew it might be time for us to move when we were walking down the street.  And she sees this guy in a kind of skinny suit, you know, little peg-legged thing.  And I say, "Hi Miles" (laughter).  She said, "Oh, wait a minute.  Hold the phone here."  But I enjoyed it because they would let me play, and, you know, I'd have my books or something.  And my dad would take me--'cause my mom was working, he would take me to the sessions.  And I would have my things and my toys or my books a lot of--mostly, it was books.  So some of my earliest memories even back in Florida were of the practice rooms at Florida A&M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] with my mom on the piano, my dad playing, and I'm under the piano playing, you know.  That's that.  So being just around musicians while they're doing things was that.  So Pearl Bailey, I remember they session they did with he and Pearl.  So he was--had become--even though he was actively playing with groups, he was also getting into--and this he did the rest of his life, playing as a studio musician.  But, and usually at that time, the musicians had to be pretty well trained, because they had to just come in, go in, look at the music, the sheet music, and play it (laughter).  Okay, you didn't have a lot of time sometimes to rehearse.  So you needed musicians who could come in, read the music and play it, take several takes and do that.  So I was able to be in sessions like that.  And even after they divorced, I was able, sometimes that was our connection when he'd take me to, like [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson or different concerts, and I'd be around.  But then as I got into the teenage years, and he was still doing studio work, he would bring me records.  That's back when records--this really dates you, the 45s, and say, "Here's a group I was just playing with, the Chi-Lites," and I'd say, "Oh, great."  And he wouldn't even know who they--I mean, you know, it's a studio gig.  So he just goes in.  He plays, and he does that.  So now, I--especially, the Chi-Lites, 'cause he did a lot of their stuff with violin solos and stuff that you hear in their records.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's kind of interesting.  You're in a shopping mall or you turn on the radio and they're, you know, that's kinda nice.
Speaker 1: So that's your father's doing the violin (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, all the, yeah, right, all those songs that you hear the violin parts, that's my dad.
Speaker 1: The strings that really make those love songs--
Speaker 2: You got it.  He was the one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he wouldn't know from--the Chi-Lites from, you know, (laughter).  I mean he would know, I mean he--but he was, you know, it was another gig, another gig.  So, but he did a lot of the things that were coming outta Chicago [Illinois] at that time.
Speaker 1: Now, did he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And Chicago had a very strong recording thing.
Speaker 1: So he sat in at, was it Chess Records [Chicago, Illinois] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and also whatever else was coming through town.  And if people were coming to town to play, he was one of the musicians for the concerts or whatever they were doing, you know, 'cause they would call--he was a union guy, of course, card carrying.  And, in fact, he was president of the local union, musicians' union there for a couple, several years.
Speaker 1: Here in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, you were in New York until you were ten, and then the family moved to Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mom and I moved back to Illinois, and we moved to Chicago--
Story_ID: 245689
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?  We always ask this question.
Speaker 2: One of the earliest childhood memories--I have several--they're all in Florida.  So the band [at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] being outside and that, being in the ant--
Speaker 1: Ant hill.
Speaker 2: --hills in Florida and that.  And also, almost drowning, and my dad [Bruce Hayden, Jr.] saving me.  And that's one because they had pools and things, and I wanted to be--they have the kiddie pool, but he was, he was a great swimmer and a great--played tennis and all that stuff, and just really loved that stuff.  And I was about three, and I wanted to be with him in the big pool.  So he had me there.  That caused a little commotion with my mom [Colleen Dowling Hayden], 'cause she wasn't there.  But she heard about it later 'cause I--something happened, and I almost drowned.  And he rescued me and things like that.  Of course, when you're three, you don't realize that maybe you shouldn't tell all the things when you go home and come in the door and talk about that incident (laughter), you know.
Speaker 1: So you give your mother a heart attack or something?
Speaker 2: I think--but I thought it was fun, you know, as a kid, you're in the big end, do that.  He rescues her.  Everybody's making out over you, you know.  You think that's something you'd wanna tell when you get home.  And I can bet he rolled his eyes a little bit.
Story_ID: 245690
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, there were two--there were, a lot of the sights and sounds had to do with the geography.  So, when you're in different places.  So Florida, it's usually the dry, kind of warm, warmth, you know, and that.  New York [New York] was just all the different people and different things and just a city feel.  And I think I'm still a city person at heart.  But there were the summers back in Illinois, from the time I was born we would--they [Hayden's parents, Colleen Dowling Hayden and Bruce Hayden, Jr.] would take me back to Illinois, whether I was in Florida or in New York, spend summers in Springfield [Illinois] and a little time in Champaign [Illinois], but mainly Springfield with my dad's parents [Bruce Hayden, Sr. and Myrtle Holmes Hayden].  And so that's really summertime, with fresh vegetables and tomatoes and corn because we were in Illinois, and those types of things, and flowers.  My grandmother had wonderful flowers and that, so I always think of, have that feeling of that.
Story_ID: 245691
Speaker 1: When you were growing up, like what were you primarily interested in?  Did you try music (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I read a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I tried it.  They [Hayden's parents, Colleen Dowling Hayden and Bruce Hayden, Jr.] had high hopes, and there were very high hopes, you know.  They just knew and they had me with--and I probably, I think I could sing a little and things like that.  But I knew--by the time I was twelve, we all agreed that I didn't need any more lessons.  I didn't need any--that that was not going to be my primary thing.
Speaker 1: So you took singing lessons and--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't take singing lesson, but I liked to sing.
Speaker 1: No singing, okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I took piano--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --mainly.  And then there was a period there where I thought, oh, I'd like to do the bass guitar, and that didn't go over well.  So that could have been it.  Maybe if they'd let me do that.
Speaker 1: What inspired you to play the bass guitar?
Speaker 2: I never got to play it.  I thought I wanted to.  I just thought it was cool.
Speaker 1: It just seems like an interesting choice for a young lady to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but my dad, you know, he played the upright bass, you know, and I loved that.  And then there was the electric bass, and that was coming in.  And he also was one of the first to do the electric violin, like [HistoryMaker] Regina Carter and things like that.  So, and I, never forget, there was one--he was playing a small club, and I was there.  And this guy was drunk.  And he pulled the plug on the thing, and it was really bad because he didn't--you know, a electric violin, it's (makes dragging sound), and he was, it was--that wasn't too good.  But, so I love, I always loved the bass and the sounds of the bass and things like that, and so--and years later when I was in the, more teen years or young adult years, in college and things, and the Funkadelic came out and Bootsy Collins and those people, I always thought, wow, 'cause I would always gravitate to the bass line or, you know, that, and loved the bass in songs and stuff.  But that, so by twelve, piano lessons, I--what I realized was I didn't have the talent that they did.  And when you grow up around people with real talent, you know it, and I knew I didn't, it didn't come as easily to me.
Story_ID: 245692
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But you liked to read, you said.
Speaker 2: Liked to read, and I could appreciate talent.  I can tell when somebody else is talented.  I can tell like that, but--and I loved to read, and that was one of the things.  And they used it as almost--now, I think about it, as a pacifier, you know, put me in a corner with a stack of books, picture books at first, and then, so, but I've always loved to read.  And I was read to, and that's what--now, what I do, we really emphasize--we try to emphasize reading to children before they can read, because it really helps give a sense of the joy of reading before they have to learn the skill.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have a favorite--what kind of books did you like to read?
Speaker 2: Oh, I read, all kinds of things.  One of my favorite books was called 'Bright April,' [Marguerite de Angeli] and it was about a little girl, little--and it was a black girl.  And that was unusual at the time when I was growing up.  We didn't have as many, even then, in the late '50s [1950s], early '60s [1960s], you didn't have many books for children that reflected them, children of color.  And there was one book though, 'Bright April' that was about a little girl who was a Brownie, and she had two pigtails, and she had a, kind of loving family.  And I just loved that book.  And I checked it out of the library so much, my mother [Colleen Dowling Hayden] thought for years that that was my book.  And that's when I learned about library fines, and having to take things back and things like that.  So I've always, as soon as I found out about libraries and places like, it's like a castle that had all these books.  So that's been a thing.
Speaker 1: Now, who was 'Bright April' by?
Speaker 2: 'Bright April' was by a white woman who was very courageous in the '50s [1950s].  And I learned about that later when I became a children's librarian, and also at library school [University of Chicago Graduate Library School, Chicago, Illinois] when I studied children's literature.  Marguerite de Angeli, and she wrote and illustrated beautiful, beautiful, very realistic illustrations, books featuring children of different ethnic groups.  So she wrote about a Jewish child, and she wrote about a Lithuanian child and Polish child, and that, and then the natural progression was an African American child, a black child.  And I understand that her publisher--I think it was HarperCollins [Publishers LLC, New York, New York], really gave her a hard time about that.  And she fought to get this book published and to be out there.
Speaker 1: Okay, is any--so you noticed there was sort of a dearth of literature for black children that reflected them?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, sure.  But growing up at the time, you were just so pleased to see something that had black characters, that wasn't Little Black Sambo (laughter).  So that was--that was something, but you didn't, you weren't really--it was hard to be exposed to it at that time.
Story_ID: 245693
Speaker 1: Were there any black librarians in your neighborhoods in those days?
Speaker 2: No, the one that I, the library that I went to, right across--there was a little storefront across from P.S. 96 [Jamaica Public School 96] in [New York] New York.  I really don't even have a memory of the library, which is interesting.  I remember the place and things like that, but the interactions, I didn't have as many interactions with the librarian.  I think I became a kind of self-sufficient library user pretty fast.  And so I didn't have as much interactions.  It wasn't until later that I actually started working in the field that I had more.  The one librarian I do remember distinctly was in Springfield, Illinois, and that was the interesting one because she was a member of my grandmother's [Myrtle Holmes Hayden] church, Zion Baptist Church [Springfield, Illinois], one of the first black churches in--it was the first black church in Springfield.  Margaret Pendergast [sic. Margaret Prendergast], and she passed recently, and there's been some literature about her, and you can look her up, Pendergast.
Speaker 1: How do you spell her last name?
Speaker 2: P-E-N-D-E-R-G-A-S-T [sic.], Pendergast.  And she was a librarian, and she was special in a way because she worked for the Illinois State Library in Springfield.  So it wasn't the public library.  It was actually the library that served state workers.  So in each state, they usually have in the capital a library for that state.
Speaker 1: So is this--
Speaker 2: And this was in Springfield, and she was a member of the church.  And she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is a black woman, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, black woman, oh, yeah, Margaret Pendergast.  And she was a stereotypical librarian if you'd look at it now.  She had the bun.  She had the glasses.  She never married.  She was--but she was feisty in her own way because what she did at that state library was she started collecting books about black people, and started a special collection there.  And so when I would visit in the summers, my grandparents, who--Miss Pendergast was in the church, and they knew she was a librarian, and they knew I liked books and that.  The Springfield public library at that time was pretty small.  And there wasn't much, you know, in terms of getting books and things, buy books and things.  And they didn't have bookstores like they have as many now.  And they would take me to visit Miss Pendergast at the state library.  And at that time, I didn't realize that that was a big deal 'cause you--the general public doesn't usually get to go into a library like that.  It's a pretty big--it's like the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.] for each state.  And she would let me take some of those books that she had for that collection, and the other children's books.  So that was my exposure to a librarian and a grand library at a time that I didn't even realize the import of that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, yeah, well, that's significant, you know, yeah.  When you were in New York, did you ever have a chance to go to the Schomburg [Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] at all when you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.  I did see the
Speaker 1: I know it's way away--
Speaker 2: --42nd Street [New York Public Library Main Branch, Stephen A. Schwarzman Building, New York, New York].  We would go there.  And my mom [Colleen Dowling Hayden] made a point of taking me to the museums there, talking about Hayden Planetarium [New York, New York] and we joked about that, and go to Hayden, and the different museums and Natural History Museum [American Museum of Natural History, New York, New York] and things like that, and the 42nd Street Library.  And that was like another palace and that.  And, and one of my greatest joys--so getting back to Miss Pendergast was, she was still living when I was in Chicago [Illinois] and came back to Chicago and was the first deputy commissioner at the Chicago Public Library.  And so to be able to be in Chicago, I'd come back from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  I was teaching in Pittsburgh, and to go down to Springfield and see Miss Pendergast and that was really cool.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was being honored by the black librarians of the state too, but that was really nice.
Story_ID: 245694
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about school.  P.S. 96 [Jamaica Public School 96, New York, New York], who is, what was the population of the school like and--
Speaker 2: It was very mixed.  And Queens [New York, New York], I think was, at that time--and still is, pretty ethnically mixed.  So, you had all types of kids there, and it seemed that we were--like we had a lot of freedom.  We were more city kids.  So you would walk home.  You'd stop at the candy store.  You get your candy, and you do that, so you--my memories of New York [New York] growing up at that time and being there were definitely of being more independent.  And I guess that was what really colored my feelings about Chicago [Illinois] when we moved there because it seemed as though everything clamped down.  I had to go to a private school.  I had to--things were much more contained.  And I didn't like Chicago much.  It took me a year--I think I like it now.  But I never liked Chicago growing up much.
Speaker 1: Do you think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) High school [South Shore High School, Chicago, Illinois] and that, you know, just wasn't--
Speaker 1: Do you think that your mother [Colleen Dowling Hayden] would have preferred to have you in private school in New York and, as a result of marriage that you were in public schools?
Speaker 2: No, I think it was just New York--everybody, it was just a different, different atmosphere, I think.  And Chicago, I think, it might have been other elements, like she didn't, you know, she was recently divorced.  She wasn't that familiar with Chicago.  Her older sister was there who had her family.  And my cousin, Steve [ph.], and his mother and father were there.  So we moved into apartment right next to theirs and that, and he was already going to St. Edmund's Episcopal [St. Edmund School, Chicago, Illinois], black Episcopal school in Chicago.  So that could have been part of it.  As a child's perception, you think of it one way.  For the adults involved, they were saying, Steve already goes there.  They can walk home from school together.  You know, they're thinking in a whole different way, and as a kid you're thinking, hmm, now, I'm going to this school with Episcopal priests (laughter), you know, and there's no candy store.  We can't stop--you know, so at ten and eleven, you're not really able to think about that.  And so it's in hindsight now that I can say, oh, yeah, that was probably (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, let's talk a little--
Speaker 2: --much easier for them.
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's talk a little bit about P.S. 96 before we get you to Chicago, and were there any--was anything special about the school that you remember, that you liked, or any special teachers?
Speaker 2: They had a kind of cool little library.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I would go in there.  One of the teachers--that's where I got--they were calling it, what did they call it back then?  You were skipped in school.  You were skipped a grade, skipped a grade.  So they started--that was where that started when I got to first grade, and my mom tells the story of, I was in first grade for about six weeks.  And I came home, and I told her I was in second grade now.  And she thought I was--yeah, right, you know, you didn't, you just went in the wrong classroom or something.  And I insisted, no.  And then she got the letter from the school saying that they put me in second grade.  And then several months later, they wanted to put me in another grade.  And that's when she said, no.  Socially, that wouldn't be good.  And she stopped that.  But I don't think I ever caught up socially (laughter).  I think I've always been behind socially (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So, all right, so you, so you were in with the older kids in--
Speaker 2: Right.  And little, and that probably wasn't the best, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have any favorite teachers or, at school?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember the teachers that much.  I remember when they introduced new math.  That was an interesting thing, and had the division with that, and then so I never really caught on to the old math.  When we moved to Chicago, it was a very traditional curriculum at St. Edmund's.  And I didn't know multiplication tables.  I didn't know any of that.  I knew new math, A, B, and all that stuff--
Story_ID: 245695
Speaker 1: You were ten years old when your parents [Colleen Dowling Hayden and Bruce Hayden, Jr.] split up.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Talk a little bit about that 'cause that had to be pretty tough on a ten-year-old?
Speaker 2: Well, you, a lot of times as I mentioned earlier, you don't realize what's going on.  And that's why now I think they really put emphasis on talking to children about these events.  I think when I was growing up the whole philosophy was not to talk about children--to almost protect them from what was going on.  So what that does, and what they've now learned is that that leaves children to speculate on things.  And because children don't have the experience and they don't know about a lot of things, their speculation sometimes is way off (laughter) or just not quite there and it causes a lot of things for kids, I think.
Story_ID: 245696
Speaker 1: They [Hayden's parents, Colleen Dowling Hayden and Bruce Hayden, Jr.] didn't tell you anything about why they're splitting up.  You just kind of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I think they said something--
Speaker 1: What was going through your, what was going through your mind?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew that there had been tensions with the whole thing I mentioned, my mom was working, all the musicians, and that, for a couple musicians.  One guy recently passed, Leroy Jenkins is a violinist, jazz violinist, who went to school at A &M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and everything.  You've probably heard of him.  And for a while, he lived with us.  And, you know, that kind of thing of having that kind of communal musician, New York [New York], beatnik, all that stuff going on, turtlenecks and the--you know, that just, she just--and she was the only one that had a kid, basically.  And she thought of it like that, you know.  I mean my dad had the kid too, but in that crowd, I was the only child.  And so she felt that that wasn't good for me to be in that environment.
Speaker 1: Well, nowadays we've seen about six movies about that kind of a problem, you know (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) But in those days, they didn't know it was gonna be a problem until they got into it.
Speaker 2: No, right, right.  So I think she thought that going back to Illinois--having more opportunities.  She didn't wanna go to--it was nothing for her in Champaign [Illinois].  But going to Chicago [Illinois], she could work.  I could go to school.  We'd be around family, was a good thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She didn't wanna stay and be divorced in New York.  She didn't think that was a--she loved New York though.  She really loved it, and she said she felt like there were times when she would sit on the steps of the New York Public Library on her lunch hour with her Chock full o'Nuts Coffee and wait to be discovered (laughter).  But she realized that they weren't discovering young black women back in those days, no matter how pretty you were and that.
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There's only one Lena Horne.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, at the time anyway.
Story_ID: 245697
Speaker 1: When you moved back to Chi--you moved to Chicago [Illinois], what neighborhood did you live in?
Speaker 2: It was the kind of Garfield [Boulevard] area, right off of State Street and 56th Street--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --not far from the school that I went to, St. Edmund's [St. Edmund School, Chicago, Illinois] which was on 61st [Street], I believe, and Michigan [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Yeah, 61st and Michigan, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: St. Edmund's Episcopal Church [Chicago, Illinois] school.
Speaker 2: St. Edmund's Episcopal Church.  And they had a school.  And from what I understand, years later the school had a hard time getting their enrollment but that the school is back, and they have a very (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It is, yeah.
Speaker 2: --dynamic pastor and everything.  So the school, St. Edmund's is back, and it was a wonderful--I have vivid memories of the teachers there, because they were black teachers and wonderful teachers.  And that experience--it was a small school, and you had, in my class, there were only eight kids.  And the class behind us had, I think they had twenty, and then maybe the class in front of us had fifteen.  But the class I was in had eight kids.  So, in one way, it was a good environment for me to come into with everything that was going on in the family, you know, divorce, moving to a new city, all of that.  Plus, my cousin was two years--what, that was like light years back then, but he was still, he was in the school too.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause there're a lot of schools in that area.  You got Betsy Ross [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]] down the street, St. Edmund's and St. (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We're right across, St. Anselm's [School, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Anselm's, across the street.
Speaker 2: --was a Catholic school, right across.  So--
Speaker 1: Well, a lot of kids in this area--
Speaker 2: --A lot of kids, lot of kids, a lot of being picked up, and all of that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so were there any memorable teachers or mentors at St. Edmund's?
Speaker 2: Oh, Mrs. [Elizabeth] Crawley, who was my seventh and eighth grade teacher.  And they put the seventh and eighth grades were in the same room, but the--and because there were only eight of us.  We were on one side of the room, and then they had the other class.  So she would teach--and then we would go to another--Miss Nash [ph.], I remember her because she taught math.  And I wasn't good at math, and because I'd had that new math in New York [New York].  And so I was pretty weak on the basics, never made that up to this day, never--don't ask me eight times seven real fast, won't work.  Miss Nash was something.  She, she had a ruler that she would use, even on the bigger kids, just on your knuckles, but that was enough to get your attention.  But Mrs. Crawley was older and she introduced us in--we would have Great Books discussions.  And I still have some of the things, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Antigone,' [Sophocles] this and that, and we'd have to discuss--every Friday morning.
Speaker 1: In the seventh and eighth grade?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, we had the Great Books, oh, yeah.  She did that, and Friday mornings were the mornings that we would discuss the books.  And we each had to buy our own and we had our own--it was a little set, and you'd have maybe six.  So I still have one of 'em, of the different plays or the different things to read.
Speaker 1: Well, that's something for the seventh and eighth grades, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but St. Edmund's was like that though.  They had a pretty rigorous curriculum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were pretty good.
Speaker 1: So what other activities were you involved in?  Were you still taking piano lessons at that time or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were still trying, but I was in the choir at St. Edmund's.  And that was, I enjoyed that.  Plus, I liked the singing part.  So I liked that, the choir, and we would sing--we'd have Friday mass, so Friday mass, the whole school would be in a Friday mass early.  And then we'd--then our class, the older grades would have Great Books afterwards and stuff.  So we liked Fridays 'cause we got that.  Then you have a special meal too for lunch.
Speaker 1: Okay, now St. Edmund's recently--at least I've been associated with it recently--I mean I knew people there.  And they have a Caribbean Day, and there're a lot of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Do they?  Great.
Speaker 1: --African parishioners now, and people from the [Caribbean] Islands and, as well as the old black middle class from, you know--
Speaker 2: Right, that's what was there when we were there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so were there people--students from other countries there, I mean who were--
Speaker 2: There was only one, and I can't remember his name.  But we all had a crush on him because his--and he really wasn't from another country.  His dad was in the diplomatic corps.  And they had lived all over the world.  And so he had an accent, and he was, you know, he lived in Kenya for a year.  Then they lived there and everything.  And so that was just really exotic back then.
Speaker 1: Okay, I don't know if, I don't know if [HistoryMaker] Russ Ewing was going to St. Edmund's when you were there, but--
Speaker 2: I'll ask my cousin.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause he--I knew the Jarretts were going there.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Tommy [Thomas Jarrett] and Bobby Jarrett [William Robert Jarrett] were there.  Larry Lewis who I just hooked up with recently through that Facebook stuff.  But different people went there.
Speaker 1: Okay, a lot of well-known doctors and lawyers and that sort of thing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --went to St. Edmund's Episcopal, yeah.
Story_ID: 245698
Speaker 1: You said it was kinda hard to adjust to Chicago [Illinois] because of the restrictions and stuff--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it just seemed like that Chicago--and that could have been, as I say, the fact that, new place, I'm getting into more the puberty part too.  So you get, you know, a lot of things.  And Chicago was, it wasn't a rough place, I guess, but there were concerns, I think.
Speaker 1: So this is like the mid-'60s [1960s], like '65 [1965] or so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-five [1965]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So things were fermenting (laughter), you know, in the city and society and things too.
Speaker 1: That's right.  This is just prior to--so you were--were you in grade school [St. Edmund School, Chicago, Illinois] when [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated, I guess?
Speaker 2: Just got in high school [South Shore High School, Chicago, Illinois], I think it was, yeah.
Speaker 1: High--okay.  Yeah, this is, all right.  Well--
Speaker 2: And the riot, there were riots and things, you know, so it was--the times were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The first riot was, was that before--when Dr. King came to Chicago in 1966--
Speaker 2: And that was controversial.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember that.  I think there were some disturbances when he came, 'cause he was in a big stadium [Soldier Field, Chicago, Illinois] and things--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --from what I remember.
Speaker 1: Did your parents [Colleen Dowling Hayden and Bruce Hayden, Jr.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think we went.  I think we--
Speaker 1: Did your mother take you to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we went.  But it was a lot of things.  And I also, one of the first concerts of the Jackson Five too, and they were at the stockyards [Chicago International Amphitheatre, Chicago, Illinois].  I remember that quite vividly because they were just phenomenal.  They were really something.  You could tell right then, said, whoa, these kids, and they had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This would be like 1967, '68 [1968]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  We went to their, that concert and we got to see them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were--now, yeah, so you loved music, I take--I can tell that.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I love music, especially when it's played well.  Another memorable concert that I went to in Chicago, years later was, Prince, when he was starting out.  And it was really interesting because you could tell this guy knows his music, and he really can play.  And he just was a wonderful, live performer.  I probably couldn't see him live now, but when he was starting out, and he was at, I think the Auditorium [Building] in Chicago was where it was, which is by Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois] where I went.
Speaker 1: Did you have favorite movies or TV shows too, growing up?
Speaker 2: Not too much.  I don't remember any movies or things.  I did like 'Lassie' ['Lassie Come Home'].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I ended up getting a collie dog and all that, that stayed in Springfield [Illinois] though 'cause we couldn't have a dog in the city.  But I did like Lassie.
Story_ID: 245699
Speaker 1: Where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to South Shore High School [Chicago, Illinois], and that's South Side of Chicago [Illinois].  And I applied to go to the University of Chicago Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois].  And I was gonna be a scholarship student because my mom [Colleen Dowling Hayden] still was--she was working for the City of Chicago then.  And as they told, they told her that I didn't have enough problems to be a scholarship student.  So, wasn't quite what they were looking for, for a scholarship student.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I went to South Shore.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is--you started at South Shore High School, what year was this?
Speaker 2: This was sixty--this was '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Sounds about right.  Okay, so 1967, South Shore High School.  Now, we've interviewed a lot of people--South Shore High School has gone through a big transition from one of the better schools to now not so good.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, at the time that I went, we were--our claim to fame in our class was that we were the last class to graduate from the old building because now, it--they built a new building more modern and things like that.  And that was like a transition.  And we were also one of the last really, fully integrated classes with about half black students, half white students.  And South Shore [Chicago, Illinois], as a community, was changing.  There was a big Jewish population, 71st Street was quite the shopping area, and it was just really something.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so a lot of Jewish students there basically, 50-50 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A lot of Jewish, a lot of Jewish students, right.
Speaker 1: --racial mix.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And it's curious.  Most people now think of it as Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois] now--
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: --and even though it's South Shore, and South Shore High School, most people think of that area as Woodlawn.
Speaker 2: That's interesting because Woodlawn was a distinct area that was more associated with Hyde Park High School [Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] in one way.  They had a--it was, Hyde Park was Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], but Woodlawn was in between Hyde Park, Woodlawn and then South Shore.  So that's interesting to hear.
Speaker 1: So, okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) As you get older, things definitely change (laughter).
Speaker 1: And so, well, tell us a little bit about what your career in Hyde Park as a student, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, in South Shore?
Speaker 1: Oh, South Shore--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, Hyde Park High School--
Speaker 1: Oh, South Shore High--oh, I'm sorry, you're in South Shore High School.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I'm thinking South--in my mind, I'm thinking South Shore for some reason.  But, yeah, South Shore High School.  Now, this is at seventy--seventy--
Speaker 2: 76th [Street]--
Speaker 1: Six and, yeah--
Speaker 2: And right off of Jeffery [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Right, between Bennett [Avenue] and Constance [Avenue], yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, and we lived, lived--
Speaker 1: Okay, so that was a Jewish neighborhood, yeah.
Speaker 2: --we lived right down, not far from 71st Street, right off of Jeffery, in a little, tiny street called Cyril [Avenue].  And we were like 70th [Street] and Cyril, apartment building there.
Speaker 1: Cyril Court they call it.
Speaker 2: Cyril Court, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: There's a big building there and with a parking lot on the corner.  I think that the parking lot's still there, I'm not sure, and that building's still there.  So that's where we moved so I could go to South Shore High School.  And it was a interesting high school because we had the different mixes, and the neighborhoods were kind of going through a change.  Everything hadn't started as much, but--
Speaker 1: But it was starting, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There were some tensions.  The black and white students related and we had friends.  One of my friends was Holly Herman [ph.] and this and that, but there were still, you could tell there were some divisions starting.  And things were getting a little tense.
Story_ID: 245700
Speaker 1: Did you participate in the usual kind--high school activities [at South Shore High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was in the, I was in the kind of choir type thing where they sang.  I really--their library was good, and I would hang out there a lot.  When I was about a junior, a girls' club formed, Delta Sigma.
Speaker 1: Without the Theta (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Without the Theta.  I don't even know if they knew that was that.  And we had all the little sweaters and our Delta things.  And we would give dances and stuff.  So we would--'cause I kind of was with that crowd.
Speaker 1: Was your mother [Colleen Dowling Hayden] in a sorority at all?
Speaker 2: She didn't.  She didn't like that.  Her sister, her older sister, who's two--about two years older than her, was in the AKA, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority.  And my mother just saw all the stuff she went through in Champaign [Illinois], you know, 'cause they were townies, but then they--she, my aunt went to University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so she was part townie, and then went there, and my mother just really rebelled against that line thing and all the things they made you do and all that.  She hated that, so she didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, did you do anything like run for class office or anything?
Speaker 2: No, no, I wasn't one of those.
Speaker 1: So you kept a low profile in the school?
Speaker 2: So I thought so (laughter), tried to 'cause I always sort of was still--and that's where I think it really hit in terms of the social disconnect, because I was younger than some of the--I was at least two years younger than most of the kids.  So I never caught up or felt very comfortable and I always tried to be cool or tried to be whatever, but I never (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You started high school at what, at eleven or twelve?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.  I was, I was--
Speaker 1: You, well, no, and before--
Speaker 2: I was, I was young though--
Speaker 1: --you were thirteen, maybe?
Speaker 2: I was like, yeah, and it was probably too young.  I know it was.  And I never caught up.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, you caught up.
Speaker 2: Well, you know what I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, it doesn't matter--
Speaker 2: Now, it doesn't matter 'cause everybody's old.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Right.
Speaker 2: Everybody's old and getting gray hair and all that.  So, it's funny.  Back in high school and things, the--what makes a difference that now really doesn't.
Speaker 1: Where's the--now that I'm oriented as to where South Shore [Chicago, Illinois] is, where you all living, right across the street from the Jewish temple [Southside Hebrew Congregation; Central Synagogue of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Was that still the Jewish temple there?
Speaker 2: No, it's not now, but it was.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I think it's now Baptist (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  So the Jewish influence is very strong and a lot of the shop owners on 71st Street were Jewish, and a lot of the ladies, as you go in the dress shops and stuff, there were the Jewish ladies and the country club that's down there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The South Shore Country Club [South Shore Cultural Center, Chicago, Illinois], right.
Speaker 2: Right, and this whole thing about why that was developed and who went there and that.  So there was a lot of, a very strong Jewish presence in South Shore at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did--were there any particular teachers that, that stood out at South Shore?
Speaker 2: A few, but I think what really stood out more at South Shore was the fact that we were, the differences between the different high schools, that South Shore had a distinct identity.  We had--we were kind of nerdy at that time in one sense, and not a cool school.  When Hyde Park [High School; Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] would play us, those were the real cool kids, and then if we ever got to play Englewood [High School; Englewood Technical Prep Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]] or something, we were, we would probably get beat up, you know (laughter) 'cause we were definitely not that.  So, that's, that's one of the strongest things.  And our teams were called the Tars, T-A-R-S.  And those were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, where does that come from?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a very nautical theme because we were close to the lake [Lake Michigan], the South Shore, you know, right there by the lake.  And our colors were blue and green.  And those aren't particularly cool colors, but we tried to make it work.  And the Tars were sailors, kind of roughneck, looking sailors, and that's what Tars were.  And that's what our team name was (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I often wondered why that, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It's not that cool.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It wasn't cool then, and I don't think it's cool now (laughter).  So you had that.  So we were, we were not known--our cheerleaders were not lively.  So being on the cheerleading squad at our school was not that big a deal.  So it was, that was what I remember the most and take from that.
Speaker 1: So other than choir, did you engage in any other extracurricular--
Speaker 2: Not that much, not too much.  It was, you know, they had different clubs, chess club and different things, but not too much (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were you a good student at South Shore?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think, my grades were pretty good.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that allowed me to look into different things.
Story_ID: 245701
Speaker 1: Was there a prom at South Shore [High School, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: For--
Speaker 2: But I don't--I didn't go.
Speaker 1: Okay, what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't wanna go.  I had been to--I went to a couple of proms in my junior year.  I went to the Hyde Park [High School; Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] prom.  And I forgot the other one, oh, the South Shore prom.  And then by then, I think what was happening too is that we were all starting to get to this kind of rebellious stage with things like proms were too bourgeois, too this, too that.  We were starting to get into the "Let's take over the buildings" type thing (laughter).  We were--that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, what year did you graduate--
Speaker 2: That was the late '60s [1960s]--
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: Sixty-nine [1969].
Speaker 1: Sixty-nine, [1969], 1969, okay.
Speaker 2: --sixty-nine [1969] and '70 [1970].  So when you get into that age, that's--and you go to school, you don't want to be associated with anything official.  That's definitely when you don't do sororities and fraternities.
Story_ID: 245702
Speaker 1: You were in high school when [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated in 19 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: But it didn't--how did it affect the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] where you were?
Speaker 2: Not as much.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It, the riots were on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: The riots were basically on the West Side--
Speaker 1: Right, and that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) of Chicago [Illinois].  So.
Speaker 1: Right, and that was also the time, you were also in high school when Julian "Cannonball" Adderley and the rest of 'em played over at Operation Breadbasket [Rainbow PUSH Coalition] with Jesse Jackson's [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] message, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, my dad [Bruce Hayden, Jr.] was still with them.  He died in '77 [1977].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he was still active in (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, would he come to Chicago to play with them when they--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he lived in Chicago by then.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he moved to Chicago.
Speaker 2: I think it--he moved to Chicago.  He got closer to us.  He did remarry, and then I had a brother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, he was--that's when he was teaching at Malcolm X College [Chicago, Illinois] and doing the work with the different studio people in Chicago and stuff.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Malcolm X College, one of the City Colleges of Chicago (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, but it was a radical college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Is it still kind of radical?
Speaker 1: Um--
Speaker 2: Not as much.
Speaker 1: No, but, yes and no.  I mean it's, it's hard to get, you know--I mean people still are energized by the name, Malcolm X.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So it brings, things come there that the administration is not necessarily seeking--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --but it comes anyway.
Speaker 2: Well, when your name a school Malcolm X, there's some expectation, I think.  And at that time, it was that the reputation was Malcolm X.  And my dad, he had the--even though when you would see him, he'd have a suit and his tie and everything, he was a pretty radical guy underneath.
Speaker 1: And did he have an afro then?
Speaker 2: He lost his hair kind of early on.  So by the time he was in his thirties, he was kind of bald.
Speaker 1: I see.  Now, did you have an afro by that time?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  We had--I mean they were like gigantic.  We have--there are photographs of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is there a story as to what happened when you got your Afro?  Is it--was it--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Was it encouraged by your mother [Colleen Dowling Hayden]?
Speaker 2: We were just doing it.
Speaker 1: Is it something your mother encouraged or--
Speaker 2: She was just--well, it was the--every--we were all doing it and afro picks and things like that, and her only thing was to keep it clean and to keep it neat (laughter).  That's it, you know, just like you would your hair.  That was your hair.  So, you just did that.  Oh, no, you, you couldn't--that was a train that was going too--I don't think there were many parents that could a stopped that.
Speaker 1: Was there an attempt at South Shore High School [Chicago, Illinois] to have dialogue between the races and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.  We did, but it was, still wasn't that bad there, you know.  So we weren't in that.
Speaker 1: Well, was there a black student organization?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 245703
Speaker 1: Throughout all of this, books play an important part.  I think '67 [1967] while you're in high school [South Shore High School, Chicago, Illinois], [HistoryMaker] Haki [Madhubuti] started Third World Press [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And there're other black--Drum & Spear [Press] started here in Washington, D.C. and Baltimore [Maryland] area.  It's, you know, so all these, these independent, black presses were starting up and people are writing and publishing and distributing books that have never been distributed before.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So the poetry became big and--
Speaker 2: And then, not long after that, even the mainstream publishers started to say, oh, there's money to be had here.  And they started publishing some things.
Speaker 1: So were you consuming this new literature as a--
Speaker 2: I knew about it, and I read it, and one of the difficulties was how to get more of it, you know, the production was limited.  And so that's, that's when I think some of the mainstream publishers started saying, "Hm, there's a demand for this."
Speaker 1: Now, did you know--now, you're a--you're gonna be a librarian in the future, but at that time, did you know any of the poets and writers in Chicago [Illinois] that were--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.  I didn't--I wasn't connected with the literary community in that sense.  I mean I liked to read and things like that, and I'd go to bookstores or hear about things.  But I wasn't talented in that instance either.  I couldn't--I wasn't a producer of literature or that.  I was still more and still am more of a consumer.
Speaker 1: Yep, most of us are consuming it rather (laughter) than (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but I'm just saying I wasn't a writer in that sense, or poet or, that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, when you were a senior in high school, then, I mean what were your aspirations?  What did you--
Speaker 2: I don't think I really knew what I wanted to do as a profession.  So I was thinking, well, maybe law or something.  I wasn't really that settled on it.  And I wasn't fortunately, getting that much pressure to pick an occupation or a profession.  I think the main pressure was to keep going to school, go to college.  And then you'll kinda figure that out later.  But at least continue your education.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so that--
Speaker 1: So neither one of your parents [Colleen Dowling Hayden and Bruce Hayden, Jr.] tried to push you towards one or another (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it was the main--the only push was, keep going.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And what were your friends doing then?  What were--
Speaker 2: A lot of them were just--a lot of the, the focus was getting into college.  Not as many of them knew, I wanna be a doctor, or things, in high school.  I didn't have that--friends that were saying, I definitely wanna be this or that, you know.  But everybody was saying, I wanna go to--you know, I'm going to college.  Where are you going to college?  How are you gonna get in college?  How are you gonna pay for it?  You know, so just the idea and being in college was the main thing.
Story_ID: 245704
Speaker 1: How did you pick a college?
Speaker 2: Well, I had several colleges that I had in mind that had to do a lot with where they were located.  And then a few that were aspirational like Tufts [University, Medford, Massachusetts] that I had heard about, Radcliffe [College, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and that type of thing.  But in terms of really being realistic and, you know, getting in, and my scores were pretty good.  But, you know, there was the times--the school, the scores and then financial part too, and all of that.  So I got accepted at Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois].  And then MacMurray College down in Jacksonville, Illinois.  And my family wanted me to go to Jacksonville because it was close to--it was similar to like at Millikin [University, Decatur, Illinois].  It was thirty miles from Springfield, Illinois with my [paternal] grandparents [Bruce Hayden, Sr. and Myrtle Holmes Hayden].  So down there, they also tried Millikin for a minute, and I didn't wanna go where my parents [Colleen Dowling Hayden and Bruce Hayden, Jr.] went.  You know that.  And I was kind of going toward Northwestern, even though it was close, but then my best friend who did turn out to be a doctor, medical doctor and still in Chicago [Illinois] now, Linda Curtis was her name then.  Now, she's Linda O'Bannon.  We were best friends, and we wanted to be roommates.  And so she got accepted at MacMurray too.  And we both got scholarships and stuff.  And so that's where I went.
Speaker 1: And MacMurray is where?
Speaker 2: MacMurray College.  It's in Jacksonville, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But I only went there a year and I left and came back to (laughter)--I was getting ready to say Baltimore [Maryland], but came back to Chicago and went to Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois] and finished up at Roosevelt.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what happened?  Why didn't you stay--
Speaker 2: That one small town, thirty miles from Springfield, it just, it didn't work for me.
Speaker 1: How many other black students were on campus?
Speaker 2: They might have had, out of 1,200 students, let's say maybe a hundred, two hundred.  There weren't that many.  It was enough.  It was a group, but I just, that just didn't do it.
Speaker 1: Now, did your best friend (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And in hindsight, I think I should have gone to Northwestern, but that's--
Speaker 1: Yeah, so--
Speaker 2: So I would advise young people to think about later in life.  So I wanted to be with my best friend, and we wanted, you know, but--
Speaker 1: Did your best friend stay there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she stayed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She stayed.
Speaker 1: You must have really not liked it, to leave your best friend and come back?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, at least I went on to somewhere else and that and so I think that's good.
Story_ID: 245705
Speaker 1: You were there [MacMurray College, Jacksonville, Illinois] a year and then decided to come up to Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Right, and Roosevelt was really interesting 'cause it's a urban school.  And it was founded by Eleanor Roosevelt.  And it's the only school that was founded by Eleanor and it's recently being rededicated to, by the Roosevelt family.  And so they have a bust of Eleanor and [President] Franklin [Delano Roosevelt] there.  And it was the school, Harold Washington went there.  A lot of people went there.  It's really dedicated to politics and public service and things like that.  So it's interracial (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, and in the heart of downtown Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: --heart of downtown.  It's really, it's definitely an urban school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how did you like Roosevelt?
Speaker 2: I liked it, and I majored in political science and history.  And then you could still be part of the city and get on the bus and ride down there, and, you know, so you were living in the city, but you're going to school.  And I think I really enjoyed that.
Speaker 1: So you lived at home--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I lived at home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was good.
Speaker 1: All right, was your mother [Colleen Dowling Hayden] glad to have you back, at home?
Speaker 2: I guess so.  I don't know (laughter).  She didn't complain (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, well, who were some of your teachers?  Political science and history is big at Roosevelt.
Speaker 2: It was, yeah.  And I had, and I can't--I'm sorry I'm blanking on his name, but he was, he died about ten years ago.  And I was really sorry to hear it, but he really was a great political science teacher and really got me to thinking about that, and (unclear) white guy.  But you'll probably--we'll find out his name, but--he's a great teacher (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think I know.  I'm trying to, I think I--was Charles V. Hamilton there?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he wrote the book 'Black Power[: The Politics of Liberation in America,' Kwame Ture and Charles V. Hamilton].
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had some strong people there.  And that political science and history and I took a lot of African history courses too.  And--
Speaker 1: Who was teaching African history then?
Speaker 2: It wasn't a person of color.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they were people who had a real interest in that.  So they didn't have as many people of color teaching at Roosevelt at that time, even though they were very liberal and things like that.  But there weren't that many.
Speaker 1: Did you know--were they the students, or [HistoryMaker] Charles [Russell] Branham and [HistoryMaker] Christopher [R.] Reed and people like that were--
Speaker 2: Right, they were there.  I didn't know 'em that well.
Speaker 1: Tim Black and--
Speaker 2: Right, [HistoryMaker] Timuel Black.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So it was a pretty activist school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so history and political science.
Speaker 2: Right, 'cause I loved history, still love history.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You get to read a lot with history.  So, that was--and political science was just intriguing, how things work.
Speaker 1: Now, were there activist groups in--I know there were all kinds of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There were all kinds of groups.
Speaker 1: --activist groups enrolled there.
Speaker 2: Inside, outside.  Chicago was just fermenting.  So you could just--it was, Chicago was a interesting place then.
Speaker 1: Yeah, did you join any of the political groups in--
Speaker 2: Not actively, not dues paying or memories.  But I remember when--and this was when I was in high school [South Shore High School, Chicago, Illinois], they had Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] came.  That's when he was still Stokely Carmichael.  And he came, and I was determined to see him.  And my mother was so worried, but nothing happened.  And he gave a talk, and we were all, just wow.
Speaker 1: I imagine [HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory spoke there too (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --I imagine, and--
Speaker 2: He was around, and so it was a real, I think, stimulating environment.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there any particular person that really, you know, was really exciting that, I mean the most exciting person that showed up there to speak or--
Speaker 2: Not that I can recall, nobody just, you know, sticks out.  I do remember Stokely Carmichael, that was the one.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So were you involved in any school activities, clubs or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not that much.  I just did my classes.  I was pretty low key.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I wasn't much of a joiner.  Never have, never, sororities or clubs or things.  The little club, Delta Sigma in high school, but not much of a joiner, still don't do that much with that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, well, I don't know.  Is there anything of significance of Roosevelt that we need to talk about that--before we graduate you (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, before I graduated, six months before I graduated, I met my future husband.  And he was also going to Roosevelt.  And so after I graduated, and he graduated, we got married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We later got divorced, no children, but that was a significant happening, I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so he was a student at Roosevelt, and you said, no children?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't have children.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And we divorced about seven years later.
Speaker 1: All right, so you were married when you graduated?
Speaker 2: Right, it was like six months before I graduated, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay--
Story_ID: 245706
Speaker 1: I was not sure if I wanted to go to graduate school or what.  And I was trying to get a job 'cause I didn't work through college.  So just basically went to school.  And I would always--I was interviewing for different jobs.  And they were telling me, you don't have any experience, things like that.  And between job interviews, I would go to the public library because that was one of my hang-outs.  And while I was there at the central library, Chicago Public [Library, Central Library; Chicago Cultural Center, Chicago, Illinois], one of my classmates [at Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois] who just graduated, came in and said, "Hey, are you here for the library jobs?"  I said, "No, what's going on?"  He said, "Oh, they're hiring anybody with a bachelor's degree."  Great.  So I went upstairs and filled out and talked to a person and said, I loved reading and have always loved reading and liked to work with children and things.  And I got the job, and he didn't, the guy that told me about it.  And then there, that was just, opened up the whole world to me in terms of the profession.
Speaker 2: Well, what year is this--
Speaker 1: Seventy-three [1973], '74 [1974].  And then they assigned me to work with a children's librarian in the Heart of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  It was 79th [Street] and, kind of west.  And when I walked in, she was on the floor, and it was a white woman who had an afro with jeans on, and she was on the floor.  And she was giving story time to a group of autistic children, black children, black children.  And I thought, wow, this is not what I thought it was gonna be.  And she was going to library school at the University of Chicago [Graduate Library School, Chicago, Illinois] at the same time.  And she was the person that they assigned me to, and to work with.  And that's how I found out about graduate library school and also she was so active in the community and just really did all these innovative things.  And it was totally different from Miss [Margaret] Pendergast [sic. Margaret Prendergast] back years ago.  But it was something that really spoke to me.  And so, then a year or two later (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, what--
Speaker 1: --I enrolled in graduate library school, and that was that.
Speaker 2: What was this lady's, what was this lady's name?
Speaker 1: Her name was Judy Zucker.
Speaker 2: Judy Zucker, okay.
Speaker 1: And she's still a librarian.  She's out in California now.  And we kept in touch.
Speaker 2: And this was Whitney Young, Whitney M. Young [Jr. Public] Library [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Oh, that was later.
Speaker 2: That's later?
Speaker 1: Yeah, then I got assigned there.
Speaker 2: So you were, you were assigned--oh, (unclear)--so, you were at a different one (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I can't remember--(unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It's at 79th Street west of--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was west, shoot, I can't remember the street.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: But it was a storefront, Auburn, that's what it was.
Speaker 2: Auburn, oh, yeah, the Auburn Gresham [Chicago, Illinois] neighborhood--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --and I can't remember the name--
Speaker 1: It was a storefront library.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And Chicago [Illinois] at that time--they have a few storefronts left, but at that time, they had a number of storefront libraries in communities.  They've since now actually built wonderful libraries throughout the city.  But at that time, they were expanding out, and using storefronts.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 245707
Speaker 1: And then I was assigned to the South Shore--South Chicago [Illinois] community.  And that was mainly a growing Hispanic community, in the children's section there.  And that's when I decided to really get serious about going to library school.  And so I worked there and went to library school.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you were going to the University of Chicago [Graduate Library School, Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And then I went to the--right, library school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then I went to--when they opened, was at Whitney [M.] Young [Jr. Public Library, Chicago, Illinois], also on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: That was a new--was that a new library?
Speaker 1: That was relatively new, but the new one that was wonderful, and I graduated from library school while I was still there, was at Woodson, the [Carter G.] Woodson Regional Library [Chicago, Illinois].  And that was wonderful.  And the person who was my mentor and still living now is a wonderful lady, Mrs. Annie Lee Carroll.  And she was the librarian there.  And she was a wonderful mentor and just a lovely lady.
Speaker 2: So she was at the Woodson--
Speaker 1: Right, she was the chief children's person there, and just--you couldn't find a better librarian or person.
Speaker 2: Okay, and Woodson, now, it's a big regional library.
Speaker 1: Yes, it was the first regional.
Speaker 2: Yes, and--
Speaker 1: And it--well, first new regional.  Chicago Public [Library, Chicago, Illinois] had had regional libraries through the years, but this was the first significant new construction in a number of years.  And it was right in the black community.  So that was very significant.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's also the home of the Harsh Collection (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Harsh Collection, the Vivian G. Harsh [Research] Collection [of Afro-American History and Literature], a wonderful, special collection of African American materials that is a smaller version of the Schomburg [Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York].  But it's on that order.  It's a very special, special place.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So it was moved from its location at the--I'm blanking on some of the names, but it was in another library, the--not the Blackstone, but another library.  And that was the library that Langston Hughes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Over on Michigan [Avenue], right--
Speaker 1: --that Langston Hughes had visited.
Speaker 2: George Cleveland Hall [Branch Library, Chicago, Illinois], George Cleveland Hall- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, the Hall Library.
Speaker 2: The Hall Branch.
Speaker 1: And Vivian G. Harsh was the librarian there who started collecting the materials and she worked with Langston Hughes, and that, and he would come into that library during his Chicago years.  So she realized the worth of supporting those authors and poets and things.  And she gathered materials too.
Speaker 2: So you start--kind of began to learn the literary history of Chicago on some level by (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, sure.
Speaker 2: --being a librarian?
Speaker 1: Oh, well, being a librarian--
Speaker 2: It's such a rich history--
Speaker 1: --was just wonderful.  It was like, really for me and just what I loved about books and reading and things like--and history and all that, becoming a librarian was like putting a fox in the chicken coop (laughter), you know.  It was just, oh, wow.  They pay me to do this.  Okay, this is okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, did you get a chance to meet Gwendolyn Brooks?
Speaker 1: Yes, I got a chance to meet Gwendolyn Brooks, [HistoryMaker] Haki Madhubuti, I mean, you know, there're just--Chicago was really something.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  So, now, when did you--now, you were working on a master's degree now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I finished that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then I worked, still working at Chicago Public, different positions, so Woodlawn--Woodson, I'm sorry, and then Whitney Young.  I was the children's librarian there for a number of years.  And then during that time, I think that's when I got divorced, and I still--and then I went to the [Chicago Public Library] Central Library [Chicago Cultural Center, Chicago, Illinois] and became the young adult services coordinator for the entire system.  So I was doing more administrative work.  And then I enrolled in the Ph.D. program at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 245708
Speaker 1: Now, at the University of Chicago [Graduate Library School, Chicago, Illinois], tell us something about the school there, you know, and--
Speaker 2: Well, it was, it had--the library school has since closed.  And it was a companion library school to Columbia University's [Columbia University, New York, New York] library school.  And they were the first graduate programs to offer Ph.D.s in library science.  So University of Chicago first and then Columbia within the next year or so between--in the '30s [1930s] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Columbia in New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Columbia in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And for years, they were the only library schools that offered Ph.D.s in library science until like the '50s [1950s].  So from the '30s [1930s] to the '50s [1950s], they were the only two places you could get Ph.D.s.  There were notable black librarians that went to University of Chicago, Virginia Lacy Jones who for years was the librarian at Atlanta U, Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and took that to new heights.  And so she was one.  So the University of Chicago had a program even in the '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s] of--and it was very directed to have at least one or two black librarians to get Ph.D.s.  And then they went on and became heads of libraries other places.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: So they had that tradition.  But it was still a rather rigid environment.  University of Chicago is not known as a very welcoming place for students of color and hadn't--had that reputation for a number of years, but--
Speaker 1: It's a very serious school anyway.  So--
Speaker 2: Well, it's a serious school to begin with.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It wasn't welcoming in general, maybe for students of color, but if they were smart, I think University of Chicago has a reputation of being the school that students don't have fun.  And they're proud of it (laughter).  That's--they were voted the school, the boringest school.  And they don't have a student union.  Everybody meets at the library, you know.  So it's not that--it's not a fun school.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, and you were there in graduate school so (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Graduate school wasn't fun either (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But at least you were an adult.  And you had other things, and most of the people have other lives.  So you weren't on campus and things like that, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, are there any significant activities or instructors there that you remember that really (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, several, and the one that, from the master's program through the Ph.D. program and years later, Zena Sutherland was her name.
Speaker 1: Z-E--
Speaker 2: Z-E-N-A, which was interesting back then that she was named Zena and Sutherland.  And she was, and still is, considered one of the giants in children's literature.  And she wrote textbooks on it, and she was very influential in terms of my career.
Speaker 1: Now, what is the--anybody else?
Speaker 2: There was another lady there, Peggy Sullivan, who was still very active professionally.  And she was the dean of the library school when I went for the master's.  And she was the one that rejected me at first.  And it was very interesting because I thought it was a racial thing.  And I had to interview with her, and she said, "Well, I'm sorry.  I don't think you're the type to be a librarian."  And I walked out and I was like, "What?"  What type do you need to be a librarian?"  So it must be racial, and I sort of thought about it and then came back the next day.  And I said, "Ms. Sullivan, you don't know what type I am," and this and that and the other.  And that's when she looked at me, and she said, "Oh, okay.  You are the type."  She wanted to see more fire.  She wanted to see more passion.  And it wasn't a racial thing at all.  She didn't want passive librarians and things like that because she's quite a little spitfire.  I didn't know it then, but she was looking for--she didn't want people that were gonna go to library school because they thought it was a nice, safe thing.  They loved books.  They didn't love people, all of that.  And so that taught me a valuable lesson.
Story_ID: 245709
Speaker 1: You become sort of, at least in Chicago [Illinois], you were known as kind of a children's literature specialist and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.  That's what I love.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  What is--I've often wondered, what is the relationship between librarians and the production of children's books, 'cause I know in the, I guess in the mid--from the mid-'70s [1970s] on, there were like more and more black children's books produced--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and more of an appreciation for children's books in the black libraries.  And I just wondered what the relationship, direct relationship is between, yeah--
Speaker 2: Well, the direct relationship with librarianship in particular, with children's literature and why that's been an area that the library field has been pretty active in, and working with publishers, and really pushing is that librarians realize the power of the word and the power of information, and that you need to capture that and unleash that and expose young people to it at the earliest stages.  And if they receive or don't receive positive images--and now we know it's with all media and we're talking about it.  But at that time, it was really the literature because you didn't have the pervasiveness of television and some other things.  But literature can be so impactful, and images with the picture books and things.  And so that's the relationship that librarians really believe that there is a correlation between what you are fed, basically, not just physically, but mentally, and what happens with you.
Story_ID: 245710
Speaker 1: All right, so after you got your Ph.D. [from University of Chicago Graduate Library School, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: I went to teach at the University of Pittsburgh library school [University of Pittsburgh School of Information Sciences, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is--did you kind of put a resume out to see where, you know, do a job search (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Actually, no, I was invited to teach there.  I had met, through my professional work--I'd worked at the Museum of Science and Industry [Chicago, Illinois] while I was finishing a dissertation and things.  And that was really wonderful because they wanted to open a public library there.  So I got to do that, work on the design and then opening it and things like that.  So, and I met different people, and I'd been meeting people professionally, nationally.  And Margaret [Mary] Kimmel who still--she's a professor emeritus at the University of Pittsburgh, I had met her.  And she's an expert on storytelling and things like that.  But she was teaching there, and I got to go on a trip to France with her, with other librarians, and we were roommates.  And so she knew I was getting the Ph.D., and she said, as soon as you get closer to graduation and things like that, let me know.  We might have a position in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  I went out to Pittsburgh.  I met the people.  And at Pittsburgh, they had two big draws, two faculty members.  It was very unusual at the time, two black faculty members, Spencer [G.] Shaw who wrote quite a bit about African Americans in libraries, African Americans in literature and that.  He was a very close friend of [HistoryMaker] Vivian [D.] Hewitt who is in New York and is an art collector and librarian there, and he was active with the Schomburg [Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] and that.  He was teaching there at the time and E.J. Josey, Dr. E.J. Josey, who is a legend in the library world and was a political activist as well.  He started the Black Caucus of librarians for the American (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How do spell his last name?
Speaker 2: Josey, J-O-S-E-Y.  He just passed last year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But if you mention E.J. Josey in any library context, black, white, everybody'll know who he was 'cause he had--he was a former president of the American Library Association [ALA].  He was just--I mean he was the librarian.  And so he was there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So he founded the Black--
Speaker 2: He was there.  He was--
Speaker 1: --Caucus.
Speaker 2: He founded the Black Caucus of the American Library Association.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's still active today.  And he was teaching there.  So the fact that I would be joining those two really stars in the library world, plus they were black, and there would be another black person on there, I mean that--Pittsburgh was the place to be at a library school that wasn't in a--it wasn't like Atlanta U [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] that was the--I think there were only two black library schools at that time.  And they both have closed.  But to--
Speaker 1: So there are none now?
Speaker 2: Not that are predominantly black, no.
Speaker 1: All right, so there was Atlanta U and another one?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it was North Carolina [Central University School of Library and Information Sciences, Durham, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, so to go to a school that had these two giants, and to be there as a junior faculty member while they're there, I couldn't resist that.  And Pittsburgh's a pretty nice place.
Speaker 1: Library friendly town (laughter).
Story_ID: 245711
Speaker 1: So you're at the University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]--
Speaker 2: Teaching.
Speaker 1: Now and you're in library heaven, basically.
Speaker 2: Library heaven.  I'm with Dr. E.J. Josey and Dr. Spencer [G.] Shaw and--
Speaker 1: Now, what year is this?  This is 1990 or so?
Speaker 2: Eighty-seven [1987], '88 [1988] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Eighty-eight [1988] and--
Speaker 2: --around there.
Speaker 1: Eighty-seven [1987], '88 [1988], okay.
Speaker 2: And it was, it was really wonderful.  They were so supportive, and until the day both of them died, they were supportive and throughout--wherever I would be, they would--encouraging and do that, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were there, what?  About four years?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was there four years, and then I got the call to come back to Chicago [Illinois] to be the first deputy commissioner and chief librarian of the Chicago [Public] Library System.
Speaker 1: Now, how did that, how did that happen?  What (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it was interesting.  I knew some people in the [Mayor Richard M.] Daley administration, and I--they were looking for a person to be the chief librarian.  And the situation that they have in Chicago, they have a commissioner, and then they have a chief librarian because in most states, there's a law that says that the--to receive any funding from a government entity, you have to have a librarian who has a master's degree at least, running the library system to receive those state funds.  And the American Library Association [ALA] really pushed hard to get that legislation passed nationally, that states would do that because they wanted to keep the integrity of the degree--the profession.  So that was part of that.  And in Chicago, they, they wanted to have the commissioner position that didn't necessarily have to be filled with someone that was a librarian, because it would be a department head.  And, but by law, they still have to have, and have to have, someone with a master's degree or more in a top management position that does operations.  And so I was recruited to be that, in that position.  And it was Chicago.  My family's still there.  My mother [Colleen Dowling Hayden] was still there.  It was an opportunity to do that.  And so I had to think a lot about that because I was kind of on that tenure track in a university setting.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this wasn't--now, so it wasn't associated with Harold Washington that you came to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, Harold Washington, I never got to serve with Harold Washington, and that was something I would have loved to have done.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He had just, he had passed while I was in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know, but it wasn't--I meant the Harold Washington Library [Center, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Well, what was happening was, they--and also bringing me back at that time, they were in the last phases of the building of the Harold Washington Library.  So that was also another draw, because here was gonna be the largest, at that time, the largest central library in the nation, and so it was working with the architects on that and making, you know, being part of that project.  And also, I got involved with making sure that there was some memorial exhibit to celebrate the contributions of Harold Washington, who the library was named after.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I became the main person working with Dolores Woods, who was the curator of the Washington collection that had been given to the library, Chicago Public Library, to work on the exhibit to make sure that that.  And Ms. Woods was a wonderful mentor to me because she knew about Chicago politics, and everything and also she definitely knew a lot about Harold Washington and had been his personal secretary for years.
Story_ID: 245712
Speaker 1: I'm gonna kinda set the stage, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, and you don't have to say anything, but 1991, I think was the year that Richard [M.] Daley was elected mayor, the son of the old Mayor [Richard J.] Daley.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And new administration.  For years, we had like a struggle over who the mayor should be in the city, and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And [HistoryMaker] Eugene Sawyer took over for Harold Washington.  Then there was like, you know, battles and primaries and stuff.  So finally, Richard Daley is the mayor, and there had been outcry in the black community.  We need another black mayor.
Speaker 2: Yes, that had been an issue.
Speaker 1: And Harold Washington's image as a black mayor who was so successful and such a powerful public figure, you know, and with all the charisma and everything, the idea of, now, in the Harold Washington Library [Center, Chicago, Illinois], we have this monument to Harold Washington, and an exhibit is to go up to, so what--and this is, well, I'm trying to set the stage for what might be (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, there was, there was tension.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was Chicago [Illinois] (laughter), and Chicago's known for its political excitement, and--
Speaker 1: For instance, I think you told me off--before we started that there was some discussion about changing the, just calling it the Washington Library.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And dropping the Harold.
Speaker 2: And, and there were discussions, there were rumors.  It was very hard to pin down where some of the things were coming from.  And I'm not sure that there was ever--and I never saw any documentation that said, let's just call it the Washington Library.  But that became one of those urban legends, and a strong rumor.  And because there was such concern in the black community about preserving the memory of Harold Washington, and making sure that that legacy did not get watered down or lost, that rumor or that idea that somehow this library was gonna open, this wonderful library, and not really honor Harold Washington's memory, and not even put his whole name on there, created quite a bit of concern within the library administration that we make sure that, one, that was dispelled and that we had an exhibit when the library opened that would reflect his legacy.  And so a group of people led by Dolores Woods, and a lot of people in his administration, Washington's administration, formed an advisory committee.  And I worked with them on making sure that that one exhibit was open and ready when the library opened.  And it was a big hoopla, 750,000-square-foot building, very imposing library.  But that that exhibit would be ready and that there would be commemorations.  And [HistoryMaker] John [H.] Johnson, the head of Johnson Publishing [Company, Chicago, Illinois], gave funds to make sure that that exhibit was a very well-designed exhibit and that we had commemorative brochures that were given, and we had a wonderful reception during the opening festivities for the Washington Library, that just featured Harold Washington.  And John Johnson was a man that I got to know during that time, and he was very helpful and also inspiring.
Speaker 1: How would you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He also helped me make the decision to come to Baltimore [Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay, I don't think it's generally known that John Johnson played that role.
Speaker 2: Oh, he, he was--he was known, and I think a lot of people knew that he was an early riser.  And he would go to work at 7:00, 7:30 in the morning.  And we arranged to have him tour the Washington Library before it opened--this is while we're still going through this.  At 7:30 in the morning--it was actually 7:00 'cause he had to be at work at 7:30, to see where the exhibit might be and to talk about this and everything.  And there he was at 7:00.  His car pulled up, and he came in the back and we gave him the tour and everything.  And he wrote out a check--it was really something to see.  But he also was very adamant about quality and also not necessarily taking credit for things.  I mean he, you know, at the end, when the exhibit opened and things, people could see, sponsored by Johnson Publishing and things like that.  But he was not interested in getting credit for anything.  Really, he wanted to make sure something happened.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what, so there was some concern that the exhibit would not be permanent, correct?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And when I left to come to Baltimore, I think that was just starting, that people were wondering about that, and the Washington collection.  And I know that that has been resolved, and there is a wonderful permanent exhibit now that I've seen.

Speaker 1: Well, the Harold Washington Library [Center, Chicago, Illinois] is a beautiful facility, and what, but what led to you leaving that position and what role did [HistoryMaker] John [H.] Johnson play?
Speaker 2: Well, I had been pretty active still in the American Library Association [ALA].  And I gave a presentation at one of our conferences while I was in Chicago [Illinois]--well, still at Chicago, about urban libraries.  And in the audience was a gentleman who was the head of the board at the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore [Maryland].  And they were looking for a director.  And so he came up after my presentation, and got my information.  And then he said that they were in a search mode and would I be interested.  And I said, no, because I had been in talks with the [Mayor Richard M.] Daley administration about becoming the commissioner for Chicago Public [Library] at that time, because the commissioner at that time in Chicago was leaving to return to an academic post.  And I was already at home.  It was the library I started with, so I wasn't really that interested.  But I must say they were very persistent in Baltimore, and I did come out to visit.  And I said I would come out to consult, and that's what I was coming out.  And then I met some of the board members here, and one person, in particular, who was the head of the search committee, Dr. J. Tyson Tildon, wonderful man, a scientist, notable in this city, in Baltimore.  He was the head of the school board for a number of years.  He's just well known in this city and just someone that--and he passed recently and it's just still hard to talk about it because he was just such a influence for me.  But he talked to me about the opportunity here.  And basically, he said, "This is a unique situation."  In Baltimore, the library is removed--as the basis of the founder, Enoch Pratt, said he wanted this library to be removed from politics and religion.  And so it has an independent board.  And so in coming to Baltimore, I would not be a mayoral appointee.  I would be appointed by the board, and I would have some remove from the politics.  And I must tell you, that was quite an attraction.  And there were still some back and forth going on in Chicago.  And I went to Mr. Johnson to talk about this.  Should I or shouldn't I, because at that point, I had basically an offer from Chicago, but things were not all gelled yet and a definite offer from Baltimore.  And I went to Mr. Johnson to ask him about that, you know, that--what to do.  And he said, "Sometimes you have to move to do better."  And he knew about the Chicago politics and some of that, and we talked about that and what the elements were.  And he encouraged me to not be afraid to move to--'cause I didn't know anybody in Baltimore.  I knew about the library.  It was a library legend.  So I knew about the Enoch Pratt, and I met the people through the search process.  But I really didn't know people here.  But he encouraged me to strike out and to take control and to have some control of my situation that I might not have had in Chicago, because of the politics and because of that.  And because, in Chicago, if you don't have clout, it's kinda hard to survive.  And I was a little fish in a great big pond (laughter) in Chicago with not much clout at all.
Story_ID: 245714
Speaker 1: Well, one thing that did happen before I--well, before I get you out of Chicago [Illinois].  Now, they--had they named the theater at Malcolm X [College, Chicago, Illinois] after your father [Bruce Hayden, Jr.] at that point?
Speaker 2: Yes, they had named it, and then the--and right before I left Chicago, they rededicated it to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, 'cause I remember there was a big, kind of deal about that, that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they rededicated it to him.
Speaker 1: Didn't they renovate the theater or something?
Speaker 2: They renovated the theater, and then they rededicated it to him.
Speaker 1: So it's the Bruce Hayden (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was the Bruce Hayden--
Speaker 1: --Theater.
Speaker 2: --Theater [Bruce K. Hayden Center for the Performing Arts, Chicago, Illinois], yeah.  In fact, this summer, I'm gonna try to go back and visit the people there and stuff.
Story_ID: 245715
Speaker 1: Enoch Pratt, now, who was Enoch Pratt (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, he was a Yankee--
Speaker 1: --the name of this library [Enoch Pratt Free Library, Baltimore, Maryland] is, okay.
Speaker 2: He was a Yankee from Middleborough, Massachusetts, and he came down in the 1860s, right after the Civil War to make his fortune in Baltimore [Maryland].  And he started out in hardware, selling nails to--that were used for horseshoes and things like that.  And he was very successful, and his hardware business expanded here in Baltimore.  And he was very frugal.  And he then went into banking.  And then he really did well, and he was--there's a street named after him in Baltimore, the Pratt Street, one of the main streets downtown.  And he was a contemporary of Mr. [William Thompson] Walters--there's a [The] Walters Art Museum [Baltimore, Maryland] here.  He was a contemporary of Mr. [George] Peabody.  There's the Peabody Music Institute [Peabody Institute of The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland] here, and also a contemporary of Mr. [Johns] Hopkins, the university, Johns Hopkins University [Baltimore, Maryland] is named for Mr. Hopkins and Mr. Johns [sic.].  And these men in Baltimore at that time each selected an institution to support to help the city grow.  And Mr. Pratt said he wanted to establish a free library.  And because, I think he was Yankee from Massachusetts, and a Unitarian, he specified in 1882 that my library shall be for all regardless of race or color.  And in Baltimore at that time, with the--after Reconstruction and everything, Baltimore is at the very beginning of the South.  It was--Maryland was a slave state.  I mean there was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A lot of turmoil around race--
Speaker 2: --race relations weren't that good--exactly.  For him to actually put that in, and for years Dr. [J.] Tyson [Tildon] that I mentioned said that even when he was growing up in the '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s] in Baltimore, the Pratt Library was one of the few places that you would see people of both races together.  And so the Pratt Library in this city has been very instrumental in helping things move along.
Speaker 1: It was sort of a island of--
Speaker 2: It's an oasis.  And it has been, and so you meet people, all types of people, Congressman [Elijah] Cummings from here, talks often about the impact of the librarians and the library had for him.  And all people of all backgrounds, when you meet them, they have a Pratt Library story.  And so what we talk about today, and I work with the librarians and the staff members now, is what are the stories gonna be thirty years from now, that people tell about the Pratt Library?  Will they say that it made a difference in my life or not.  And that's what we should think about every day.  What are we doing to create those types of memories for kids today?
Story_ID: 245716
Speaker 1: So you came here [Enoch Pratt Free Library, Baltimore, Maryland] in 1991--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ninety-three [1993].
Speaker 1: Three, 1993.
Speaker 2: And they, and they said--and I turned down the Chicago [Illinois] offer.  And in the Chicago paper--and my mom [Colleen Dowling Hayden] still has the clipping, they called it a tale of two cities, I guess, because of the literary reference.  And for a while, it was will she go to Baltimore [Maryland], because that leaked out that I had the Baltimore--will she stay in Chicago?  That was the tale of two cities.  So, that's my only claim to fame.  That's my fifteen minutes.
Speaker 1: You didn't get the TV show, 'The Decision'?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't get it, but that was an audience for, but overwhelmingly people were encouraging me to go to Baltimore, which was interesting, to get away from the political environment which was, I thought, very interesting.
Speaker 1: So how's it been here?  Is it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's been wonderful.
Speaker 1: --has it lived up to your--
Speaker 2: Yes, it has.  It's been an honor for me to be part of bringing a library that has such a reputation--it was a legend in the library world, and significant in the city, to try to bring it back to its significance today.  And it's taken a while because the city has gone through so many challenges, economic, social, high drug rate, everything.  And to have, to work in a library that means something in a city--it's not like in a suburban library sometimes where a library is a nicety.  But it's not a necessity.  And in a city like Baltimore, the library is relevant and means something to people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is a library that celebrates the literary tradition of Edgar Allen Poe and H.L. Mencken and Lucille Clifton.
Speaker 2: Lucille Clifton was the first black board member.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And she recently passed, and she was--we had a big celebration, in fact, a couple of weeks ago of her life and her family members were here, and it was wonderful.  It was an evening of poetry and literature.
Speaker 1: Okay, so are you still involved, very much involved in the youth activities (unclear)?
Speaker 2: And I even get a chance to tell stories every now and then.  And that's very humbling.  If you can keep a group of four-year olds entertained, that's much more challenging than a city council hearing.
Speaker 1: Okay now when you got here, did you have--was there much innovation that you had to do and did you have to--or was it in pretty good condition or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it--the library was in, had fallen in physical disrepair, twenty-one branches--at that time, it had twenty-eight.  We had to close some branches because of financial difficulties.  The management needed to be stabilized.  Technology needed to be introduced.  So there were a lot of challenges.  But the real attraction for me was that I had a lot of freedom to work with staff and the board to just do what needed to be done without the interference of politics to a large degree.  And that allowed us to make--I think, cover a lot of ground.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  You know, Baltimore, we were discussing off-camera, and Baltimore seems to be one of the homes for storytelling in the country- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, it is.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Especially black storytelling.  It was the, the home--Sister Mary Carter [Smith] was one of the founders of the National Association of Black Storytellers [NABS] here in Baltimore.  That's where it started.  And they're celebrating the year that this interview is taking place, their thirtieth anniversary.  And it's gonna be in Baltimore.  But nationally, librarians from all over the country will be coming to Baltimore.
Speaker 1: So that started here, and you, and you--and we were discussing in the beginning that one of your, Stanley Butler is one of your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) One of the librarians at Pratt is the president of it, and has been a master storyteller, and nationally known, internationally known for a number of years.  So we're very fortunate that he's still also a librarian in a community in Baltimore too, very active.
Speaker 1: And there's another gentleman who we were discussing was [W.] Paul Coates who was a major book distributor and bookstore person who became a librarian--
Speaker 2: Right, Paul Coates, who has Black Classics Press [sic. Black Classic Press, Baltimore, Maryland] and also was the person who published a book by Walter Mosley, and Walter Mosley joined a partnership with Black Classic Press so that one of his best-selling books would be published by a black publisher.  And that really was a notable event and there was a lot of publicity about that.  But Paul Coates is a definite pioneer and history maker.
Story_ID: 245717
Speaker 1: Tell me about the American Library Association [ALA] and your involvement in the American Library Association.
Speaker 2: Well, I was elected to be president of the American Library Association.  And that's the oldest and the largest organization that is involved with libraries.  So it has about sixty-five thousand members, mainly librarians and it represents--it's the voice of public libraries in particular in this country.  And I was elected and--to be president, my first elected position.  And it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is the first--okay.
Speaker 2: I never ran for anything, school, president, and anything like that.
Speaker 1: How do you get to be the president of the American Library Association?
Speaker 2: You actually have to campaign, and you have to have a platform, and you have to present to the different groups, and you have to do interviews.  And you have to actually run for it, and I had an opponent.  And I guess that, a little bit of that Chicago [Illinois] rubs off on you.  So (laughter), I won by a wide margin, and we--there were no dirty politics though.  But it was a clean election, but it was an interesting experience.  And it was also interesting because I had, by that time made friends with some political figures in the Baltimore [Maryland] area.  And they helped me with the campaign.  The other person who helped me with the campaigning came out and did a fundraiser for me, was [HistoryMaker] Tavis Smiley.  We had had him here several times for book signings, and he heard that I was running for the American Library Association president.  And he actually came out and gave a donation, one of the first donations to my campaign that allowed me to buy T-shirts and buttons to give to the librarians at the conference.  You have to really do that kind of electioneering.  And that, and I've been grateful for that ever since.  And he's been back to the [Enoch] Pratt [Free] Library [Baltimore, Maryland] to do book signings.
Speaker 1: Okay, does he have a connection here locally at all, I mean in terms of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I don't think there's any direct connection.  I think he--what I've found is he can be very supportive of people that are trying to do things.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was your platform?
Speaker 2: Well, my platform was equity of access, that people of all backgrounds should have as much access to library services as possible.  And sometimes we may not realize that in libraries that the policies that we put in place are actually barriers to access.  And homeless--if you have a requirement that someone has to show a driver's license to get a library card, that can eliminate a lot of people, or if there has to be a residency thing.  You have to show a piece of mail.  Well, what about the homeless people.  So there're lots of things that we do in libraries sometimes that are actually blocking people from using us freely and that we should look at all of our policies.  We should look at the people we hire to make sure that sometimes they reflect the communities that they're working in.  So, it was really asking the library community to look at everything we do to make sure that our libraries stay free and open.
Story_ID: 245718
Speaker 1: After 9/11 [September 11, 2001]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --[U.S. Department of] Homeland Security came up with some--there's even legislation, right, to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, the [USA] PATRIOT Act [of 2001].
Speaker 1: PATRIOT Act, right.
Speaker 2: And that, and during my term, that, the PATRIOT Act was enacted, and there was a section--and there still is a Section 215 that related to library records.  And while I was president, I had to represent the [American Library] Association [ALA] and take a stand basically saying that we were concerned about that section that allowed the federal government to look at and confiscate library records without the library being able to tell the person who's being investigated that their records were being examined.  And, in fact, we couldn't even tell other staff members or our boards that the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] or whatever agency had visited us.  We would be put in jail if we revealed that we were even asked for records, much less the names.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) These are records of the kind of books you check out or--
Speaker 2: The books, the use of computers.  We also and still at this time, are able to, say you sign in for a computer session.  There's a way, as everybody knows, that you can track what someone's looking at, what websites they're going to.  And we have that information.  And so the government, without--and this was another aspect of it that we were concerned about, could go into and get a court, a closed court, and get the warrant for this type of search without showing cause.  So they did not have to say we suspect Larry Crowe of this, this and this.  They could just say, we want to look at his records.  That's all they had to do.  So they did not even have to show any proof.  And so what bothered, and in a true sense, the librarians who had this covenant of trust with our patrons, is that you may be interested in jihad, just because you're interested in it.  You've heard the name.  You wanna know more about it.  That doesn't mean that you intend to join.  So interests and intent are not necessarily equal.  And that's what we wanted to protect and make sure that people could still want to find out information about anything without being investigated and not knowing that they were being investigated.  And it really escalated to the point that the government was able to just find out, not even particular names of people coming in to a search, but would say, be able to say, we want to see the names of everyone who has ever looked at this.  So that's really broadening to it, to the extent that it was unacceptable.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you achieve any success with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We did have some successes in terms of that, and each subsequent passage or reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act, there have been modifications to that section so that there is notification.  Librarians will not be jailed if they reveal that the FBI--so each reauthorization, we've been able to effect some modification.
Speaker 1: Now, you, you've actually had to speak with John Ashcroft who was then attorney general (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --about these--
Speaker 2: Right, so it--as my grandmother said at the time, "I never thought being a librarian would get you to do this kinda thing."  (Laughter) She was very amazed.
Story_ID: 245719
Speaker 1: Well, back to the Baltimore [Maryland] library.  Now, what have been some of the plans that you have for the Enoch Pratt [Free Library, Baltimore, Maryland] now, I mean what have you been doing, and where are you going?
Speaker 2: Well, what the library's been doing, and I've been pretty involved in, is expanding electronic and computer access to the public.  And so, for instance, all of our branches are basically wireless now.  And we have just started to loan laptops to people when they come into the Central Library [Enoch Pratt Free Library, Baltimore, Maryland].  And so we wanna expand that to all the twenty-one branches.  So if you come in the door, and you don't have a laptop computer, you can just check one out and use it and sit anywhere in the library because we can't--we've expanded to--we have over a thousand computers in our facilities for the staff and the public.  And we can't keep enough computers.  I mean, we could have a terminal at every seat.  And so the laptops have allowed us, and the wireless access have allowed us to almost do that, to have people be able to sit at any seat and have that.  So that's something in the next year or two we will be really rolling out more and more computer access points throughout the system.
Speaker 1: What about some of the other electronic--well, technological innovations?  I've noticed that some of your newsletters, you've been mentioning other (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, the downloading?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We already allow people to download materials, books, best sellers through a program called Overdrive--that's the current one, that you can use it, for your electronic device.  You can download a book, or several books now.  And so we'll be expanding that.  So we actually have, for instance, docking stations in our libraries that you can bring in your device at home.  Right now you can do it over the Internet, but we want you to be able to actually, while you're in the library, just put your device down as well.  So that's exciting because we're adding, we've added coffee, like a coffee shop in our Central Library.  And so we're gonna do some more of the amenities, another coffee shop in our southeast library.  So just really making the library a welcoming place for everybody.
Story_ID: 245720
Speaker 1: What's the future of books?  What's your opinion on the future of books (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I think, when I mentioned the electronic devices, I think what we're seeing right now, at this point, is a shifting in terms of going from the physical book, as we know it, with the cardboard covers and the paper pages, to electronic devices, some that are now devoted just to being readable as books and other materials--
Speaker 1: Like the Kindle?
Speaker 2: Right, the Kindle is very popular now and things like that.  The Nook that one bookstore [Barnes & Noble, Inc.] is pushing, but, so right now, there're all types of devices, but--so the future is gonna be there.  You will be able to--and, and we have the iPod pad [iPad] that just came out.  You can do other things beside that.  So you'll be able to do all kinds of things with your electronic device, including reading text, reading books.  And so in the future, when you go to a library, you might see a lot of those docking stations, and you will be able to check out the device itself.  If you can't afford a device, you'll be able to do that.  And the device will hold, like it does now, ten books, and those books will disappear in your three weeks.  So just like we do now, you have to bring it back.  Right now, you can download a book and in a certain period of time, you won't have it on your device.  It's programmed so that will happen.  So that's what's gonna happen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think there'll still be people who will want a physical book as we know it now, especially paperbacks because they're easy to carry and sometimes you might want something that doesn't have to be plugged in or isn't battery operated.  Then it could be solar, but what if it's--the sun goes out.  So there is something--we had a conference, to be said about just text and paper and sunlight.  One of our conferences, library conferences, a person started describing that the attributes of a physical book, like it was a future product and not telling the people what it was and all the things.  And then he gets down to, "And here it is," because people were oohing and ah-ing, yeah, that would be great.  It's portable, it's this, you--inexpensive, you can drop it, all of that.  And then he held up that so that his point was it, it still works as a object that we might not get rid of.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have favorite authors yourself?
Speaker 2: Oh, I have a lot of authors.  I have some authors that I--I go through stages.  So right now, and I've been in this stage for a little while, mystery writers.  People who write mysteries and things like that.  So I have, I think my favorite author sometimes is the one I'm reading at that time.
Story_ID: 245721
Speaker 1: When you look back over everything you've done to this point, is there anything that you would do differently if you could, besides going to Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I would go to Northwestern.  That's the basic thing.  I think all the other things would have maybe worked out, but I now know that probably was a pivotal decision.  But as some of the elders in the community say, you did the best you could with what you knew at the time.
Story_ID: 245722
Speaker 1: Well, you know, you're certainly popular here in Baltimore [Maryland], and, you know, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, that's a blessing.
Speaker 1: And every time I come, people always talk about you.  What are your plans for the Enoch Pratt [Free Library, Baltimore, Maryland]?  How long are you gonna stay?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know.  But I do know that I'd like to go back to the academic setting.  I'm teaching occasionally at the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland], has a library school [College of Information Studies], and I'm an adjunct there.  And I enjoy it so, and so I think that after that, the hustle and bustle of administration and management and things like that, I would like to go back and teach.
Story_ID: 245723
Speaker 1: We always ask this question, when you look at everything you've done to this point in your life, what do you think--what do you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think that I was able to contribute to a city and an institution in a city that tries to make people's lives better.  And that I was able to actually contribute something.
Story_ID: 245724
Speaker 1: Now, we always ask about the family.  What has your mother [Colleen Dowling Hayden] thought about your career as a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She thinks it's been quite a ride (laughter) from--and especially in my entire family being a librarian.  They thought that was a pretty natural fit.  I like to read, and I was always in a book and all that.  So, they, they thought that was okay, but to see the administrative side in that has been a surprise for all of them.  And I think she enjoys it particularly because she had been involved in city government in Chicago [Illinois] in that aspect.  So I think she likes seeing me do this type of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is there anything I have not asked you that we need to address and talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Not that I'm aware of, but there're more people that I probably could talk about who were influential or helped me, but I guess it's suffice to say that I had so many people that helped me along the way and you can never repay them, but I think that part of the repayment might be to continue to contribute and to do well.
Story_ID: 245725
Speaker 1: What advice would you give to young people about library science as a career?
Speaker 2: Well, it's not your grandmother's library, as we say.  And she's welcome, and that's our favorite saying, but that it's an opportunity to empower other people, that providing information to people can be, I think one of the best things you can do, especially as there's so much more information available now.  We're in an information society.  It's even more so than when I started in the profession.  So teaching people and, how to use information effectively, how to decide what is valuable information, what's viable information, what's trusted information, and how to create it yourself, just being in that information business is a wonderful way if you're not a medical doctor and you can't do surgery or you can't defend people in court, or, you know, you don't wanna be the activist that gets out and protests.  But that's a way that you can really give back.
Story_ID: 245726
Speaker 1: Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As someone who tried to help.
