Speaker 1: This [The] HistoryMakers interview is being conducted with James E. Guilford [HistoryMaker James Guilford] at his home at 44 John Eliot Square in Roxbury neighborhood of the City of Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And the date is April 7, 2006.  The interviewer is [HistoryMaker] Robert C. Hayden and the videographer is Neculai Burghelea.  Mr. HistoryMaker--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Would you give me your full name--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and would you spell your name, including your middle name?
Speaker 2: James Edward Guilford, Junior, J-A-M-E-S, E-D-W-A-R-D, G-U-I-L-F-O-R-D--
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: --Junior, J-U-N-I-O-R.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  When were you born, Mr. Guilford, and where were you born?
Speaker 2: I was born October the 7th, 1911, in a house on 28th--at 28th Sterling Street [Melnea Cass Boulevard], Roxbury, in a five-room, cold-water flat in Roxbury, Massachusetts.
Speaker 1: And about how far was that from here, from where we are now?
Speaker 2: Well, where I'm living now, I wasn't allowed to come here.  This is Eliot Square.  This was--the, the--it was called Ward 9, and at that time I was born, this space was gerrymandered and so practically all Irish lived in this area here.
Speaker 1: Irish lived here?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And all the politicians that came out of Ward 9 originated from here.  But the way--the reason I said gerrymandered is because it was impossible for any African American to gain a political position, because the way--as I said before, the ward was gerrymandered.  But I lived about five blocks from here which is now--which is Sterling Street which is now Melnea Cass Boulevard and that was--the reason why Sterling Street was chosen, because this is a direct connection to the expressway that's over--that's, that's over on the vicinity of another street called Albany Street and extends all the way over to Columbus Avenue.  But originally, it was started-the Melnea Boulevard was originally made because they were thinking about making it a passway to Cambridge [Massachusetts] going through the Fenway [Boston, Massachusetts], but the property in the Fenway, it was so expensive they had to discontinue that, because all the schools in Ms. Jack Gardner's [Isabella Stewart Gardner] palace [Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston, Massachusetts], which is a historical treasure was located in this part plus Simmons College [Boston, Massachusetts] and, I think Emerson College [Boston, Massachusetts] is also in that same path [sic.], so they had to give up that idea of putting the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Highway.
Speaker 2: --Melnea Cass Boulevard to connect with Cambridge.

Speaker 1: What do you remember as a young boy about the Sterling Street [Melnea Cass Boulevard] neighborhood?  How do you remember it?  What was it like?  What was the neighborhood like [in Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Well, Sterling Street neighborhood was where I was--I lived there for twenty-five years, and my father [James Guilford, Sr.]--well, many of the people lived there, lived in rented apartment houses, townhouses and also rented the cold-water flats.  We didn't have any central heating system in those days, and in fact, we didn't even have electricity.  Gas lighting was the main feature in all the homes.  And, of course, it was a very close neighborhood, because it was--it was mixed to a certain extent, and we had the--well, they had everybody.  They had Jewish population and you had the Irish population which was intertwined into the area, plus the African American population.  And, some of the African Americans, a lot of 'em came in from the West Indies and lived there, also.  But the area was very well--well, everybody lived there for a number of years.  In other words, they didn't--there was--no one moved and as a result, everybody knew everybody.  And say for example, I can remember everybody that's lived within say two or three blocks of my area by name and where they lived, and because they'd been there so long.  And, of course, we had a neighborhood school which was called the Sherwin School [Boston, Massachusetts] which is right on Sterling Street which is about two blocks from me, and that was very convenient, which was a grammar school.  And, of course, my--that was very close.  And my primary school was the Lafayette School [Boston, Massachusetts].  It was at 25 Ruggles Street which was now a condominium which is still there.
Speaker 1: The first school was the Sherwin, is that what you said?
Speaker 2: No, the first school I went to--
Speaker 1: Was--
Speaker 2: --was not the Sherwin.  The first school I went to was the Hyde School [Boston, Massachusetts], was--
Speaker 1: Oh, Hyde.
Speaker 2: --as kindergarten which was on Hammond Street.  The second school, that was an all-girls school and that was--kindergarten was set up--Hammond Street was the--was the location of the all-girls grammar school.  Then, the primary school which was mixed was--included the first through the third grades, was on Ruggles Street which is now, as I said, a--where--in fact, the [Bay State] Banner had its office there for a short while at 25 Ruggles Street.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And it's a school that sits down into, like, a gulley and it's--and it's--it has a brick yard and it has a iron-wrought fence.  It's--borders Ruggles Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now the name of that school again was the--
Speaker 2: What's that?
Speaker 1: The name of that school?
Speaker 2: Lafayette School.
Speaker 1: Lafayette.  But you--
Speaker 2: And that was--that was--I was there and I was--I got there in the first grade which I was about five years old, and Miss Rafferty [ph.] was the principal.
Speaker 1: Miss who?
Speaker 2: Mrs. Rafferty.
Speaker 1: Do you know how to spell that?
Speaker 2: R-A-F-F-E-R-T-Y.  Raf--Raf--I think it's Rafftery--R-F--
Speaker 1: Rafferty?
Speaker 2: R-A-F-F-T-E-R--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --T-Y.  Rafftery, yeah.  It was--Raffery--either that--the name was Raffery or Rafftery.  Maybe it was Raffery.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But anyway, I remember her because she gave me a rapped hand at one time, a physical--which is a punishment which they were allowed to do to children in those days and she had like a ruler and told me to hold my hand out.
Speaker 1: What was your offense?
Speaker 2: Well, the offense was, they had some kind of a Halloween party and there was some pennies or something involved, and I was accused of taking the pennies.  And, of course, that was--that was really a false statement, 'cause I didn't even need any money at that time, 'cause my father was pretty much what you call a middle-class person, and I could get anything I wanted.  And so, anyway, they still accused me of taking these pennies.  So, that's what I was--so I told my mother [Nancy Haskins Guildford] about it, and she was quite upset, because she believed me--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --because she knew I wouldn't have taken any pennies (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Story_ID: 269046
Speaker 1: What was your mother's name?
Speaker 2: Nancy [Haskins Guilford], and they called her--well, originally, her name was--in the South, they have two names.  If you're--people are familiar with the southern families, they called her Nanny Belle.  But when she got to Boston [Massachusetts], I wouldn't call her Nanny Belle--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and, and I wouldn't give her a name--I was--I used to call her by the name of Nancy.
Speaker 1: Where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Lynchburg, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Approximately what year?
Speaker 2: Well, we--well, I think it was--she was ninety years old when she passed, and I was sixty-five years old at the time, so if you'd do the math I think it comes about to be about nineteen--1876 [sic. 1886].
Speaker 1: That's right, um-hm.
Speaker 2: And, and that--but she--but the funny thing, there's an incident there, when she became ninety years old.  She was a very beautiful woman and very particular, well, fastidious about her appearance.  And she wouldn't go out the street at all unless she was fully dressed and had her makeup and everything else on.  And so anyway, when she became ninety years old I, I complimented her.  I said, "Mother, you're--congratulations on being ninety years old."  So with her attitude, the way she is about her age, she looked at me, she said--shook her head, said, "I ain't no ninety years old!"  (Laughter) And I had to really--I got a big kick out of it because she was very fastidious about her appearance and everything.
Speaker 1: How old was she when she came to Boston, do you know?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know, but she got married quite young, and my father [James Guilford, Sr.], and they all got married because evidently, she had several miscarriages for children at--when she first got married.  So I was the first one to be born that lived and--that was conceived that lived.  And, and the reason she--I lived was--happened to be that she had a very great--good doctor that became a very--family doctor and a good friend of mine and the family by the name of John B. Hall.
Speaker 1: Oh, I remember.
Speaker 2: And he was a--he lived at 60 Windsor Street.  And he had a--he was a Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] graduate, but he came out of New Orleans [Louisiana] and he was more or less what they call--the, the--what they call people in New--what they call the people in--
Speaker 1: Creole?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a Creole.  He looked very fair.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So evidently due to the segregation in the schools and whatnot, he might've been considered white when he went to Yale, but he came out with a--as a very top flight doctor.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And he was our family physician.  The reason I mention my mother having children: she had lost two children at the [Massachusetts] Homeopathic Hospital [Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts] on Harrison Avenue.  And so when she lost those two children, he decided not to let her have children in the hospital anymore.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: So he attended all four of us at 28 Sterling Street [Melnea Cass Boulevard] when we were born.
Speaker 1: At your home.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And that's quite a story, because he was such a good friend.
Speaker 1: Were your mother and father married in Virginia or here?
Speaker 2: No, they were married in Boston.  The reason they were married in Boston is 'cause my mother came to Boston because she had an older sister by the name of Mary Lizzie [ph.] who had lived on Yarmouth Street, and she came  in that area down--Yarmouth, that's where the prominent--that's where most of the blacks had lived at that particular time.  They--'cause the West End [Boston, Massachusetts] is where a lot of the African Americans lived finally or due to gentrifications, came into the South End [Boston, Massachusetts].  But that hadn't started even at that time, but--
Speaker 1: And the South End is one of Boston's neighborhoods.
Speaker 2: The South End was one of the neighborhoods where the African Americans, or blacks, lived extensively.  And, of course, she lived--that's where she landed.
Story_ID: 269047
Speaker 1: And my father [James Guilford, Sr.], he came to Boston [Massachusetts] 'cause his oldest brother by the name of Dudley [ph.] Guilford had married one of the Yates which is Lula Yates [ph.], and the Yates family was a real prominent Boston family that perhaps had never been in the--that--their ancestors had never been in slavery, and they had been free practically all their life, and they lived in Dorchester [Boston, Massachusetts].  But he came here as a young man, Uncle Dudley, and he joined the church called Saints of--Church of--Church of God--Saints of Christ--Gods and Saints of Christ [sic. Church of God and Saints of Christ].  It's an--I think it was more like--well, anyway, they had a big gathering.  They had a home on Arnold Street where they also had--where, where the--where the parishes lived, and he was--and also I remember him so well because there was a bishop by the name of Bishop [William Henry] Plummer who came and visited Boston quite frequently and he was a--Church of God and Saints of Christ, that's the name of the church, and he always talked about the promised land.  And he would--he also was a customer of mine when I was a barber, as an older person.  And he was a--he used to come in and talk about the promised land, and I didn't know where it was located.  But my Uncle Dudley always talked about the promised land.
Speaker 2: What was your father's occupation here in Boston?
Speaker 1: Well, my father was a waiter, primarily, and that's where he worked at the--his first job as a waiter was at the Woodcock Hotel [Hotel Woodcock] on--which is now [East] Berkeley Street which was then called Dover Street.  And they had a big building there on the corner--on the corner of Washington [Street] and Dover Street which is now Berkeley Street and was--and they had a--had a restaurant, which was maybe the first time or beginning of nightclubs and they had a--where they served--had entertainment, mostly a pianist, a famous--some black pianist was there who was well-known.  And they had--served food and liquor as dinner--at night--it must've been late occasions.  And so what they did, and Lincoln Pope, Sr., was the head waiter.  And, of course, I remember all this, 'cause this is all happened when I was in my teenager, so my father talked about it often.  And they used to service mostly judges and brokers and business people used to come in there for entertainment and also used to, you know, with--because there was no prohibition then; it was legal.  And they had the--served the champagne.  Champagne was a very popular drink at that time.
Story_ID: 269048
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did your mother [Nancy Haskins Guilford] work?
Speaker 1: My mother didn't work at all, no.
Speaker 2: She didn't.
Speaker 1: No, she was a housewife.  And she did--during the [Great] Depression, she did take a job as a chambermaid at the Copley Plaza Hotel [Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel, Boston, Massachusetts] to help out, because everybody helped out--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --during, during the Depression, the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s].  I even helped out.  I sold newspapers, and I started barbering at the age of twelve to help out, and then the WPA [Works Progress Administration] came into existence.  And after the WPA came into existence, the men--doctors and lawyers and everybody else were in the streets getting about fifteen dollars a week as their pay, for sustenance.  And then it was--I was cutting hair at the time for thirty-five cents a haircut and fifteen cents for a shave.  And I taught--I was in high school when I was taught how to become a barber, 'cause I wanted to--I went to Mr. Gordon [ph.] who had a barbershop on Shawmut Avenue, which is around the corner from me, at 724 Shawmut Avenue.  And his name was Robert Gordon, and he came out of Tennessee.  But as people know, it--as black barbers, at that time, it was always--it came out of the South--had serviced only white customers.  In other words, he had the--so they were--they--his--a lot of them had--but would service like all the prominent white people in that particular vicinity, wherever they were, like the lawyers and the doctors, and they were very disciplined about their business.  And Mr. Gordon was a person who had been in that particular area of work, and he was very disciplined about his business, and he was a wonderful person.  And he opened his shop on time, and he closed it on time and didn't allow anything unruly or undisciplined to happen to his shop.  And, of course, he was a tall, gangly person, and I remember him so well, 'cause he was such a nice person.  And he always reminded me of Gary Cooper they way he--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --way he looked, was tall, gangly, and casual appearance.  And he was light brown-skinned.  He wasn't black.  He was sort of mulatto, what you call a mulatto.  And he never got any gray hair, but he wanted gray hair so bad, but anyway, he never got gray hair.  But getting back to the story of barbering, he taught me how to barber at twelve years old, and I became so proficient that I became his personal barber.  He wouldn't allow anyone else to touch him, shave him or cut his hair except me.
Speaker 2: So you were a teenager when you did the--
Speaker 1: I was a teenager when I actually became a professional.  I was a professional barber, guaranteed, 'cause there was no licensing boards, or--as a matter of fact, the licensing board hadn't even been established--
Speaker 2: Is that right?
Speaker 1: --in Massachusetts, not in--not when I was twenty--that would be 1923, 'cause I was twelve years old.  And, and I was--and I had just--well, I had just gotten into the [Boston] Latin School [Boston, Massachusetts], because I went to the Latin School for--as a sixth year--
Speaker 2: That's--you went to what high school?
Speaker 1: Boston Latin School.
Speaker 2: Boston Latin.
Speaker 1: As a (unclear).  And so that's why I went into teach--learn how to do barbering, because during the Depression, I had wanted to make some money to go to college, and that was--so he told--I told Mr. Gordon my story, so he had me--he had an older man at one time as a shoeshine boy, so he told me, "You can come in here after school and be the shoeshine boy, and I'll teach you barbering."  And he had another fellow by the name of John Haynes [ph.] which is a fabulous-looking fellow and a fabulous barber.  And he--Mr. Gordon taught me everything.  And, of course, what happened to me where I could read, and Mr. Gordon couldn't read or write, and I helped him, 'cause he knew how--they paid the barbers like 60/40, that was all they knew.  In other words, he knew how to count money in order to pay off his help, 60/40, but he didn't know how to keep books or anything.  So I taught him how to set up his books and, and, and of course he had a bank account that he never used.  But in the long run, understand that even though he--well, this is another--this is going a little ahead of myself.  But anyway, he had a bank account and kept, you know, his money in the bank, and he was very religious, also.  But the one oddity he had, he was--had some fear, because he evidently did something wrong in Tennessee, and he always mentioned the fact how he had to leave Tennessee and sleep in pigpens in order to get away, so he must've had done something wrong.  But he always carried a gun, and no one knew it, but he had a--always had a revolver on him.  And I guess if anyone came after him, they were gonna have it.
Speaker 2: But, how'd you know that?
Speaker 1: Well, he told me.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: I knew it.  I mean, we knew it.  The people in the--the barbers knew it--
Speaker 2: That--
Speaker 1: --that he had--always had a gun, but he never used it or never pulled it out or anything, but he always had it on him.
Story_ID: 269049
Speaker 1: What do you remember, before you became a teenager and learned barbering, what was it like growing up here in this neighborhood [in Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts], Sterling Street [Melnea Cass Boulevard], Shawmut Avenue--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --as a young--what was it like growing--
Speaker 2: Well-
Speaker 1: --up here?
Speaker 2: --the neighborhood was mixed, as I told you before.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But every group, like every family on the street knew one another, so if you did anything wrong, you didn't have to--you didn't have--your, your mother and father didn't have to worry about it, because someone else would tell her or tell them about your misconduct.  So, as a result, you were really chaperoned by the whole area.  And so, there's a school, was nearby.  Then, you had what you called Madison Park [Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts] which is now filled in with housing and whatnot, but that was a beautiful park with trees and everything, and it was bounded by Westminster Street, Sterling Street, Warren Street, and Marble Street, which is not there anymore.  And it was about a hundred yards on each side, and as youngsters, we used to use that as our play area.  And we used to go down there, and we used to have a track or relay races at times.  We'd use that particular park as a relay base, because you could put a person on each corner and run about four hundred yards, so each person would run about a hundred yards, and then you get the teams together, and they challenge one another.  But, and then also, we had a--in the park, there was like set up--well, you had pathways, concrete walkways that came from Sterling Street, on the corner of Sterling and, and, and Warren Street--or Westmin- that was Westminster Street.  That's not there anymore either.  Westminster Street and Sterling Street was a--was a--and then Sherwin School [Boston, Massachusetts] was on the other side of Sterling Street which it--which it was bounded by Windsor Street.  It set at--it took up that whole end, end block.  And anyway so there was--but Madison Park was a place where people could walk from the corner, from one corner to the other, and also in the middle, they had pathways, so it was like a crisscross.  And in the center, there was a flagpole where the flag was at.  And in the one corner of Sterling Street, they had a fountain, water fountain.  But in the meantime in those triangular areas, there was a place where we could play.  And so we had a game called kick the bar.
Speaker 1: Kick the--
Speaker 2: Kick the bar.  Kick the bar was a bicycle tire cut about maybe less than twelve inches, and it had a bend to it.  So they put the bend--they take that--so what would happen is you lay out the field like a baseball field with the first base, second base, third base, and home plate, and they put the players at each position.  They'd have a catcher at the--home plate, wouldn't have no pitcher but you'd have people at first base, second base, and third base, and you'd have the outfielders at left field, center field, and right field, so you have about eight people playing at--on each side.  So what happened is you have a ordinary brick, a red brick that you put down at home plate, and you put the--this bent piece of rubber to the left foot or whatever, whatever you foot you want to kick with, put the right foot or left foot.  If it was on the right foot, you put that--put it on the left side inside the brick.  If it was on the right--if you a left-hand--left foot kicker, you put it on the right.  So you run back a few yards and run up to the--to the--to where the rubber hose was and kick it.  Of course, it would go into the air and--like a baseball.  So, if it was caught, it didn't mean anything.  But the--but so you start running--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and you start running from one base--from first--from home plate to first base to second base.  And as long as you could run, you keep on running, but in the meantime, whoever caught it would throw it back and it would be like a boomerang.  It was--it would--well, it would twist over like that until it would--whoever--the catcher would catch it, and he'd hit the brick with the--and whatever base you're running to and haven't got there--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that's the--that's the number he would call.  He'd say second or third.  And if you didn't get to second or third before he hit that brick, you were out.
Speaker 1: I never heard of this one before.
Speaker 2: It was a very popular game.  And that was where a lot of the neighborhood kids all congratulate--I mean, congregated, and we had a wonderful time.  And that was--well, that was one of the things that that park was--well, that's about one of the only things we'd played there, 'cause you couldn't--it was too small to play baseball, or any other game that required more space.
Speaker 1: It was a large park where people could walk with their children--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, they had benches--
Speaker 1: --where they could picnic and so on?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had just a few large areas that were--they could use, triangular areas that could be used.  Course, the benches were on the side of the walking areas.  And, of course, they didn't--they weren't into the triangular part.  It was just like a piece of pie cut up, you know?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, and so that's where the walks were.
Story_ID: 269050
Speaker 1: Tell me about Boston Latin School [Boston, Massachusetts].  What was that like for you?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: How do you remember Latin School?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, Boston Latin School was something that--when I first went there, I was told to go there by Dr. [John B.] Hall and he--when he found out that I was in the fourth grade and--it was, yeah, the fourth, fourth--yeah, I was in--well, anyway, I was in sixth grade, I guess, when I went to Latin School, 'cause it started from the sixth grade--you had to go in, there, that which they called the (unclear).  So I--my report card, though, I had all A's on my report card.  No, no Bs, just all A's.  And I was a pretty good student.  And so, anyway, he saw my report card.  He already had a son by the name of John Hall in the Latin School at the time.  So, he told my father [James Guilford, Sr.] to send me to the Latin School.  So I went to the Latin School with my--with time of--it was an exam school, as far as I understand, but I didn't have to take an exam.
Speaker 1: You didn't?
Speaker 2: Because I was exempt with my--due to my report card which showed all A's for the whole term I was in the--in the sixth grade that year.
Speaker 1: I don't think they do that anymore.  I think they have to take an exam now.
Speaker 2: Oh, they have to take--I'm pretty sure they have to take exam.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But if you had all A's--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you wouldn't have no trouble passing.  'Cause it seems like now the--'cause I'm--there was a--there was--the thing of it is, they say that the Latin School is being sold, you know, so a lot of--because so many people from the suburbs were coming in to Boston [Massachusetts] and registering their children, because the equivalent of the Latin School's education was equivalent to a private school's education.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was tops, yeah.
Speaker 2: And, and then so they were taking advantage of that, see?  Because their students could pass the exams.  They were--so Latin School still--where the public school was set up for the--for the children, but didn't come up to the standards, so that they could pass.  So, very few of the people coming out of the public schools were able to enter the Latin School.  They might've gone to some other secondary school where--in Boston, but they couldn't pass the Latin School exam.  So that was quite a rude--upset and people were very upset about that, not--the school--Boston Public Schools not coming up to standard.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Did you enjoy your time at Latin School?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't finish (laughter).
Speaker 1: You didn't finish.
Speaker 2: Well, well I finished--well, I was getting into Latin School.  When I got into Latin--this is something that has to be told because Patrick T. Campbell was the headmaster of the Latin School at that particular time, so when I went to--my father get--presented me to the Latin School, he said, "Well, your son isn't going to college, so why are you bringing him here?"  And, and that was the racism rock right off the bat.  So, my father practically ignored him.  You know, he knew what was happening.  He--'cause he was pretty smart himself.  So, knowing that he had to let me in, he still put me into the Latin School, so I got in--I ended up in Latin School in 1922, but Mr. Campbell was probably fairly--he was fairly right in this one instance, because when I got into Latin School, I didn't get the help, the tutorial help, that I needed, and that's one thing, I don't care who you are in the Latin School, no one student in Latin School knows--will get good marks in all subjects.  Some of 'em--there's a deficiency at somewhere--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --along the line.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But most of 'em get help from their parents who are college people, or either they have outside tutors help them.  So I did all right until I got to the--class two, that was just--the year before I graduated.  I--so I finally--I think I repeated that.  I think I repeated one class, but I got into the senior class, and that's where I ran into difficulty.  I was in the--I was deficient in English, and I needed a tutor, but all through my Latin School experience, and even though I was deficient in English, not one of the teachers gave me any assistance.
Speaker 1: Didn't give you help.
Speaker 2: No one gave me any help or told me what to do, even though I knew I needed help.  My father, he tried to help me, but he didn't have that background enough to help me which was coming out of the Latin School.  I mean, you know, I--
Speaker 1: But, you know, that kind of thing is still going on today.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know whether--
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: --it's going on today, but, anyway, they didn't help me.  So I didn't finish the senior class.  Even though I repeated the senior class several times, 'cause I tried to--but I also was barbering at the time quite a bit.  I was doing barbering.
Speaker 1: While you were in high school.
Speaker 2: And, and sometimes I'd stay up all night long just to read a book--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --to make out a book report.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I was--now, the funny thing about it, my skills were in math and physics.  I almost got 100 exam--100 in one of my college entry exams.  It was in advanced algebra.  And I was, was very--had very high marks in all the rest of my subjects, but English, I didn't pass.  I mean, no I didn't--I didn't take English at that particular time.  But anyway, when I came up to graduate, I failed in English, and I couldn't get my diploma.  So I tried several times to come back, but I was working at the time, and I didn't have time to study, and I was working as a barber and--
Speaker 1: Did you transfer to another school at all or--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't transfer.
Speaker 1: You didn't.
Speaker 2: Not then, no.  So then I finally left the Latin School completely, and I went to--I got my high school diploma from Boston Central [Adult] High School [Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts], which is the night school.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: And that's where I got my diploma--
Story_ID: 269051
Speaker 1: So then after I got my [high school] diploma, I shortly went into business in 1934, 'cause I'd been barbering--as a barber with Mr. Grey [ph.]--that's another story--Mr. Grey who has--who was called the dean of barbering, and I went to work for him.  And then after he passed, the store--his store--his business was sold to a group of businessmen called The Challengers [Challengers Club].
Speaker 2: Where was Mr. Grey's shop?
Speaker 1: Mr. Grey was the dean of barbers.  He had three shops.  He had one on Dartmouth Street and he had two on Tremont Street.  The, the one on Dart--
Speaker 2: South End [Boston, Massachusetts]?  South End?  Tremont, South End?
Speaker 1: No, Tremont--
Speaker 2: Oh, downtown?
Speaker 1: No, no.  He had one--Dartmouth Street was--it was more or less in the South End.
Speaker 2: Okay, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the South End.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The Tremont Street I'm talking about was up here near Hammond Street which is--which is called Lower Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It's still Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts].  See, Roxbury starts from Mass [Massachusetts] Avenue back.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then--and, and the South End starts from Mass Avenue down.
Speaker 2: Down, right.
Speaker 1: See, in other words, you're going downtown, you start from Mass Avenue downtown--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --until you get to--
Speaker 2: And Sterling--
Speaker 1: --Dartmouth Street--
Speaker 2: Sterling Street [Melnea Cass Boulevard] was this side, so you lived in--
Speaker 1: Sterling Street--
Speaker 2: --Lower Roxbury.
Speaker 1: I lived on the other side of Mass Avenue which was Rox--
Speaker 2: Low--
Speaker 1: --Roxbury.
Speaker 2: Lower Rox--
Speaker 1: Then they have upper Roxbury which starts up from Dudley Street up to Franklin Field.
Speaker 2: So this would be--
Speaker 1: Franklin Park [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: --upper Roxbury now where you are, pretty much?
Speaker 1: Well, this is Roxbury.  Oh, this is definitely Roxbury, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This is--
Speaker 2: This is kind of upper and that was lower.
Speaker 1: And then you go to--this is all Roxbury.  Roxbury is the original part of--one of the part of--original part of Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It was--just--it was--it had its own, what you call--
Speaker 2: Its own town.
Speaker 1: Its own town.
Speaker 2: It was a separate town.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And this is where a lot of the homes that are here listed are over two hundred years old, and they--and they part of Fort Hill [Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, Roxbury was the base where all the governors of Massachu- well, I guess it was Massachusetts that had homes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A lot of the governors lived here--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and this is--
Speaker 1: And all of the--
Speaker 2: A lot of Revolutionary War history right here.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, right here.  Yeah.  You know about that.  You're the history--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You're living right in the middle of that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I'm in the middle of it right now.
Story_ID: 269052
Speaker 1: And of course, the most famous tutor was Sam Perry [Samuel Perry].  He died recently.
Speaker 2: I understand.
Speaker 1: And he had his office in the [Boston] Public Library [Central Library, Boston, Massachusetts], downtown.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That's where he had his office.
Speaker 2: I remember.
Speaker 1: And he, he was fabulous.  But he'll be missed--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --tremendously, because he was mentor to this child that I had recommended to [Boston] Latin School [Boston, Massachusetts], and he came out with honors, and now he's going to college.
Speaker 2: Indeed he did, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He's fabulous.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, also, come to think of it, he also tutored my daughter, who is a doctor, and she was at the Girl's Latin School [Boston Latin Academy, Boston, Massachusetts].  She just had a little trouble with mathematics or something, or some kind of subject.  She said, "Oh, daddy, I don't need any help."  I said, by me knowing what has happened with me, I had Mr. Perry tutor her, and she was at Girls' Latin School, and she came out of Latin School, and then she went to Northeastern [University, Boston, Massachusetts], graduated from Northeastern.  Then, she went--
Speaker 2: Well, give me--give me your daughter's name then.  What was her--
Speaker 1: Marcia--her name now is Marcia Guilford Davenport, M.D.
Speaker 2: And where did--oh, she's an M.D.?
Speaker 1: Yeah, she's an M.D. now.
Speaker 2: Where does she live?
Speaker 1: She lives in Baltimore, Maryland, and she's with the Public Health--United States public health department [United States Public Health Service].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Do you have other children?
Speaker 1: Beg your pardon?
Speaker 2: Do you have other children?
Speaker 1: Do I have other children?  Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I have another daughter by the name of Jeanne [Guilford Eason] and she's a college graduate also.  And she's a--now a x-ray technician with the--she was with the New England Baptist--she was a secretary at New England Baptist Hospital [Boston, Massachusetts], but I told her you don't need a graduate degree to be a secretary, so she finally got ambition enough to become a x-ray technician, and now she's with Beth Israel Hospital [Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts].  And I guess she's thinking about going in to become a radiologist, but she's very smart.
Speaker 2: Your first daughter's name again?  The first name?
Speaker 1: Marcia Davenport.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What year was she born?
Speaker 1: And Jeanne--my second daughter's name is Jeanne Eason.
Speaker 2: J-E-A-N?
Speaker 1: Yeah, J-E-A-N, S-O-N.
Speaker 2: Her first name is Jean?
Speaker 1: Yeah, J-E-A-N-N-E.
Speaker 2: Okay, and her last name again?
Speaker 1: Eason, E-A-S-O-N.
Speaker 2: E-A-S--
Speaker 1: Jeanne Guilford Eason.
Speaker 2: --E-A-S, okay.  What year was Marcia born, do you remember?
Speaker 1: Marcia is fifty-four years old now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And Jeanne is fifty-two.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's good.  Any other children?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I have Jimmy (laughter).  Jimmy--James Guilford III.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He--he's thirty-three this year.
Speaker 2: Okay, good.  And where does he live?
Speaker 1: He lives in Dorchester [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: In Dorchester, okay.  So you have Marcia, Jeanne, and--
Speaker 1: And Jimmy.
Speaker 2: --Jimmy.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And he has a son named Jimmy [Guilford] IV.
Speaker 2: Okay, very good.
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  Grandson.
Speaker 2: When you were--
Speaker 1: I have a great--
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: I have a great-grandson also--
Story_ID: 269053
Speaker 1: When you were at [Boston] Latin School [Boston, Massachusetts], you were fifteen, sixteen, and seventeen--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: You were barbering.
Speaker 2: I was barbering (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Had you decided at that point that's what you were gonna do, or did you have some other ideas of what you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  Barbering is just a stepping stone for me to make some money, because at that time, it was very--black people couldn't even borrow a hundred dollars from the bank.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, there's no source of income for anyone to get the money, unless I got it myself.  And, of course, my father [James Guilford, Sr.] wasn't able to put any money aside.  So I was making more money than some people who were on--well, it wasn't called welfare then, it was WPA [Works Progress Administration], and I was making around, well, whatever it was, and I also had a paper route which I had which was a--well, I had--I had a daily paper route, which was I say a paper stand, I had--I had both.  Had a paper route on Sunday, I sold Sunday papers, and that's when I had my brother Richard [Guilford] help me.  And I also had a stand on the corner of Northampton Street and Tremont Street at the corner of the Chickering Piano Craft Guild building [Chickering Piano Factory; Piano Craft Guild, Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And it had belonged--that stand belonged to my cousins, Clarence [ph.] and Clifford [ph.] who were twins, and they were--they lived on Warren Street, and they supported their family during the [Great] Depression with that particular stand, selling news--
Speaker 1: How much would you make a day or a week selling newspapers, do you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, the papers were selling like six cents a-piece and--five cents, and, maybe--it was hard to say, because three or four dollars was a lot of money then.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: 'Cause, see, some people were making--only making as much as twenty-five dollars a week, so if you could come up with four, five or six dollars a day--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --off a paper route, you were--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you were in the--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --in the--in the work--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in the economy--
Speaker 1: How much was a haircut then?  How much did you charge?
Speaker 2: I told you, thirty-five cents for a haircut and fifty cents for shaves, and shoe shines were ten cents.  And that's where--that's where you made a lot of money, shining shoes.  And, of course, I did errands, and I used to wash windows.  And, of course, I'd do errands.  I used to do errands, too, for people.  And, of course, then you didn't have any--well, there was no automobiles around anyway, no automobiles, but people had to walk or use the public transportation.  'Cause, now people don't know it, but streetcars used to go up and down Tremont Street and used to go up and down Northampton Street.  So where the junction where I had my paper route, paper stand at North--which I finally took over from my cousins, on the corner of North--corner of Northampton Street and Tremont--and Tremont Street, was a junction for the streetcars--
Speaker 1: For the streetcar.
Speaker 2: --coming from Mass [Massachusetts] Avenue Station going out to City Point--or the Dudley Street, rather, they went to Dudley Street.  Washington Street had streetcars on it then, too.  And then, the streetcars that went from Tremont Street came all the way from Forest Hills [Jamaica Plain, Boston, Massachusetts], so Tremont Street all the way down and went into the subway and went into North Station.  And--
Speaker 1: So where you had your paper stand was a--
Speaker 2: Right at the junction.
Speaker 1: --a good point.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: At the point.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, what happened, there was a--during the what they call the number game, the policy game which was the numbers which is played by everybody (laughter), more or less, it was started in Harlem [New York, New York]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and they called it the N pool, I won't say the word.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, and that's what it was originally--so anyway, that particular part--that--people would play that every day, and then they would get the number from New York, and it was in the paper called The Record, and it was in the stock section called clearinghouse.  And the number that came up in the clearinghouse--
Speaker 1: Would be the number.
Speaker 2: --would be the number for that particular day.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And there'd be four numbers that would come up; there'd be four numbers.  So, if you played the three numbers--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: For a dollar, you get as much as six hundred to one.  In some cases, they dropped it down to four hundred to one. And--
Speaker 1: I remember the old key shop on the [Massachusetts Avenue] Bridge on Mass Ave (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the key shop was, was one of the places that--
Speaker 1: The big, big place.
Speaker 2: --that, that was one of the big places--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --famous places that, that--at--they, they operated like a grocery store.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But, see, those days, people could do things illegally, even bootleg, as long as they got in with the police.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Police were taking bribes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, of course, it's not even coming from the man on the beat--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --the bribes started in the state house with the captains or lieutenants or either the vice squad.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They had a vice squad.
Speaker 1: Well, I remember the key shop was very, very busy.
Speaker 2: Oh, the key shop was very--
Speaker 1: 'Cause I went in there a couple--
Speaker 2: That was very notorious.
Speaker 1: --of times myself.
Speaker 2: That was a--
Speaker 1: People in and out, in and out--
Speaker 2: That was a--
Speaker 1: --all day long.
Speaker 2: That was a notorious--
Speaker 1: They would--
Speaker 2: They had a--
Speaker 1: They would--
Speaker 2: --tremendous business.
Speaker 1: --double park, triple park.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That was right at the bridge.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember.
Speaker 2: Right at the bridge on Mass Avenue.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You were going towards Huntington Avenue.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I remember--well anyways, that was just one of the few places that did numbers.  Mr. Gold [ph.] had one, same thing on Camden [Street] and Tremont Street.  He had a market as a front.  The key shop, they had the key shop as a front, but they didn't do any keys (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And Mr. Gold had the market on Tremont, Tremont at eight--it must've been 808 Tremont Street.  He had a market there but he didn't do any--didn't do any--if you bought any groceries from him, he'd get mad (laughter).  It was a front.
Story_ID: 269054
Speaker 1: So you continued into your twenties and up until the [Great] Depression, you continued in barbering, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  I continued barbering.  And the thing of it is, I stayed--after I--let me think.  After, after--oh, I went into the [U.S. military] service.  I bought the shop from the Challengers Club, and I stayed in business from 1934 to 1942.
Speaker 1: And whose shop did you buy?
Speaker 2: From the Challengers Club, the businessmen club.  See, they bought the shop from Mr. Grey [ph.].  You asked me about Mr. Grey.
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Mr. Grey had three shops.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And he had one in Dartmouth Street, then he had two on Tremont Street [Boston, Massachusetts].  And Mr. Holloway [ph.] had one and Mr. Poole [ph.] had one.  But Mr. Poole committed suicide on the shop which is between--in the 900 block just, just before--it's between--well, it's, it's--well, between Shag Taylor's drugstore [Lincoln Pharmacy] and Hammond Street.  Shag Taylor had a very famous store, liquor and pharmacy, on the corner of Kendall [Street] and Tremont Street.  Well, well, his--well, anyway, Mr. Poole committed suicide and that--so they did away with that shop, and he came back into--what he did, he gave up his shop on Dartmouth Street which was being--oh, well, he was losing business, 'cause it, it--the area was just--gentrification was taking over, and his customers went--even though he had all the railroad men, the people, Pullman porters and all that as customers, Red Caps, the trade was dwindling, so he brought 'em back into the lower Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts], and he set up a shop at 912 Tremont Street; that's where I first started working for him.  He had put his (unclear) shop there.  Mr. Grey was a very distinguished looking man.  He was a mulatto, short, and had a very booming voice.  And so he was quite a person.  He belonged to the sportsman's club, and he was quite, you know, a person among--and as a socialite.  And he was from Petersburg, Virginia, also by the way.  That's how I happened to get in with him, because my father [James Guilford, Sr.] was from Petersburg, and they knew one another.  So Mr. Grey allowed me to come in there to work after school, and I was--by that time, I was sixteen years old.  See, I was a--I was a really accomplished barber, because I'd been trained by Mr. [Robert] Gordon [ph.], then I left Mr. Gordon with a man by the name of George King [ph.] who came out of North Carolina.  He was the one that was interested in me.  And so he took a job in Everett [Massachusetts], and went to--we went--so he took a job--the shop was on Tileston [Street] and Main Street in Everett.  And it was strictly a mixed business there, because Italians and the blacks all were mixed in together, so that's where I had a chance on learning how to cut all types of hair, straight hair, curly hair, any kind of hair, and worked on the both people, you know, white and black.  And so by that time, I was--I used to go there after school, so by that time I was sixteen years old.  But I didn't like it out there, because there wasn't enough activity for me, see, because any time you work in the neighborhood barbershop, you have to work--during the morning hours, nothing's happening.  Then the business comes in when the people get from work and come in or those who are there during the day are just maybe students or something like that.  But in Boston [Massachusetts] and Lower Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts], you open your door, people are scrambling to get in, so I was used to that, see, from Mr. Gordon's shop where I learned and also--where Mr. Gordon--so I knew what was happening before I was in town.  So I told my boss, "I don't want to stay out here," so he said, "Well, go see Mr. Grey."  So I went into Mr. Grey, and Mr. Grey gave me a chair in his shop.  But the thing of it is, he had the first chair as the barber, as the owner.  So I told him, I said, he wanted to put me in the back.  I said, "No, I'm not going in the back.  If I get the back, no one will know I'm here," (laughter).  So he gave me--
Speaker 1: How many chairs did he have?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: How many chairs did he have?
Speaker 2: He had six chairs.
Speaker 1: Six?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then the thing--the story--those, those--I remember how bad and how bad looking this--that shop is after what's happening today.  They had the bare wood floors which they kept oiled.  Then, they had a big old back--big old belly--black belly stove that they used for heating purposes.  And, all the furniture was just white and black, you know, white showcases and black--white chairs, big old white chairs with--but, so they had six of 'em.  And, then--but they were lined up against the wall, but he had a huge window on the left.  As you come in the door, it's--they--you'd be facing the barber chairs, but on the left was the window--the window which faced the street, and he had the first chair facing the street.  So I told him, I said, "I'll come there and work if you give me the first chair," (laughter).  He gave me the first chair.  So I became an attraction, a young fellow, sixteen years old, working on the first chair in a barbershop. And I had all my schoolmates and everybody, girls and fellows would come in, and I'd cut their hair, and I was a very good barber, so I'd been taught, see (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Wow.
Story_ID: 269055
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How many heads did you cut a day? Do you remember?
Speaker 1: Well, I'll tell you.  You figure it out yourself.  Thirty-five cents a day, a haircut and on Saturday, it was your biggest day.  You'd gross ten dollars.  So how many hairs would you have to cut?
Speaker 2: You gross ten dollars, so--
Speaker 1: Well, you have to cut the most--
Speaker 2: Well, you're talking thirty or forty heads.
Speaker 1: You have to cut thirty heads.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you would cut hair at the rate of fifteen--one every fifteen minutes.  You had to cut thirty heads in order to make ten dollars.  And of course, in the meantime, you do shaves, shampoos or something, 'cause you, you build up your charge for the customer if you gave them more services.  So you gave them like a haircut and a shave and a massage, or a haircut, shave, and shampoo.  We used to run specials for like a dollar, see?  And so there you could work on ten customers and then you'll make, make ten dollar.  But if you made ten dollars for a day, you'd make--that'd be your pay for that day which is 60/40, so you made six dollars a day.  That's--that was--that was their--so, for the whole week, you might sit in that shop on certain days and not wet a towel, as they would say.  "You haven't wet a towel."  "Hear what?"  "Oh, I haven't wet a towel.  I haven't wet a towel."  And, I remember when I had my shop, we had for lunch, we used to have what they call lunch, you know, lunch period.  We'd have a--used to get a box of Uneeda biscuits, be about this size, and get a--maybe even got a can of sardines and everybody got a (laughter)--everybody would get a sardine, and that'd be our lunch for four or five people.  And they also did that with a piece of chicken.  Like people come around and sell fried chicken, they'd give you a half a chicken for maybe fifty cents.  And so that'd be--of course, you'd get a piece of bread with it, take two pieces of bread--everybody would get a piece of bread and put part of that chicken, that'd be their lunch.
Story_ID: 269056
Speaker 1: How many days a week did you cut hair?
Speaker 2: Well, we had--then, I think they'd cut hair--they, they--some of the shops closed on Wednesday--started--they used to cut every day except Sunday, but they started--the association called the Master Barbers--Association of Master Barbers and Beauticians [sic. Associated Master Barbers and Beauticians of America; Hair International] which came on later, in the year 1947, and they organized the barbers in Boston [Massachusetts], the black barbers.  They also--the white barbers were--well, everybody was organized.  And they had white barbers downtown called the Boston chapter and they had the Roxbury chapter which was called--they called us the South End chapter.  And they--we were organized by, by Mr. Riziti [ph.] who came out of Chicago [Illinois] as a national organizer, and he organized the Association of Master Barbers of America [sic. Associated Master Barbers of America; Hair International].  And they--all the state--every state had chapters, and they had a national convention which come every--I think every three years.  And, of course, I was one of the--I eventually became president of my local chapter.  Then, I became a delegate to the state chapter, had a state chapter here called Boston, Massachusetts Associated Master Barbers and--of Massachusetts [Associated Master Barbers of Massachusetts].  And they also had a--they had a national magazine [Master for Barber] and I was on the--I was on the executive committee of the Master--of the state association when I was elected to be vice president.  And, during that period, I became chairman of the press and publicity committee, and I wrote a column in the national magazine for every--which came out monthly.
Speaker 1: What did you write about?
Speaker 2: Well, I wrote about things that were happening in Boston, like the shows, and had people--different--giving different--we gave shows and the things that were happening, like anything that happened with the barbers association.  And they had--some--there was a lot to write about.  I have some of the magazines now, but I have to go back and look at what--see what I wrote about (laughter).  But I used to take pictures of contests and have the pictures of the winners and the--and I'd write the bylines for the pictures and everything, and make sure they got in the newspapers.  Like, oh, we had a convention here in--national convention, and that's when they came here in, it was nineteen--I guess it must've been the 1950s, I think, something like that.  And they had it at the Somerset Hotel [Hotel Somerset, Boston, Massachusetts], and I was chairman with press and publicity committee at the time for the national--
Speaker 1: Well, when were you the president of the Associated Barbers--I'm sorry, president of the Associated Master Barbers of Massachusetts?  You were president--
Speaker 2: I was the president in 1962.  I finally became president in nineteen--that's, that's later.  But I was president of the local chapter for about twelve years--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --until I became--because, well, the ten years, twelve years--anyway, a long time.
Story_ID: 269057
Speaker 1: I became president of the Associated Master Barbers and Beauticians of Massachusetts [Associated Master Barbers of Massachusetts] in 1962.
Speaker 2: Now how long were you president?
Speaker 1: One year.
Speaker 2: One year, oh.
Speaker 1: Because I was supposed to go for two years but something happened; I'll tell you about that.  But anyway (laughter), they--coming to the convention--
Speaker 2: How did--well, let me say, how did you get elected?  People voted?
Speaker 1: No, they, they had delegates at the--at the national convention--
Speaker 2: And they--
Speaker 1: You had a--we'd have a state convention with the Association of Master Barbers [sic. Associated Master Barbers of America; Hair International], so I was the delegate for my chapter and--myself and Malik [ph.] who was a--who had a barbershop [Beau Nubian Brummel Tonsorial Emporium, Boston, Massachusetts].  His name was Reginald Johnson [Jr.] at the time.  He became a Muslim and his name changed to Malik Kaluk [ph.], you know who I'm talking about, he had the (unclear) business.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So anyway, he and I were delegates and so they didn't want to put me on the ticket, because they said, "Well, if he gets elected to be fourth vice president, someday, he's gonna be president."  So the fella by the name of Joe Barone [ph.] didn't want me to get on the ticket, because he was supposed to be a shoe-in, see?  So--but there was another fellow by the name of-I don't have his name, just--he had a barbershop on Prospect Street in Cambridge [Massachusetts].  And he--I can't remember--I have his name in my book, but he was also a candidate.  So we gave our votes to him.  As a result, he won the election as president, and I got on the ticket as vice president.  And so, anyway, Joe Barone, even though he got defeated over the years on account of what we did, we still became very good friends, but that was what happened.  And so then--and, of course, what happened, everybody that stayed president, stayed in for a term of two years.  So after two years went by on each election, I eventually became president.
Speaker 2: And what were your responsibilities as the president?
Speaker 1: Well, I'd oversee the--all the meetings and, and handle, you know, as a president, we--I'd shared all the public meetings, and then I visited all the various chapters, 'cause they'd have meetings or, or--
Speaker 2: Across the state?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, all the--they had chapters in all the cities, like Springfield [Massachusetts] had a chapter, Quincy [Massachusetts] had a chapter, you know?
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: Cambridge had a chapter.  And then I'd visit all this--as the president, I'd visit all the--Lowell [Massachusetts] had a chapter.  'Cause Lowell was an incident, what really messed me up, because I went to Lowell to represent them at a convention they was having.  They invited the--so they had all the people there for this assembly.  And so, when I went there, they told me to sit on the floor with the president of the union.  Well, the union and I are two different people.  I'm--this chapter--I'm the president of the chapter that's giving the affair, so the master of ceremony was a national organizer, and I can't call his name right now, but anyway, he was a national organizer.  So he, in turn, told me to sit on the floor with the president.  So I said, "I'm not sitting on the floor."  I said, "I'm gonna sit up there on the--on the--on the--on the roster [sic. rostrum], up on the platform with the rest of the officers of the chapter.  I'm the president."  So they had their wives and the only officers up there on the platform.  Yet, I'm the president of the association on a national--on a state level, and I'm sitting on the floor, so I got up and walked away.  I walk--I left.  So when I left, they got--all got upset.  So when I came back to the regular meetings for the election of the--of being reelected, they said, "You ain't gonna get elected [HistoryMaker] Mr. [James] Guilford," (laughter).  I said, "So what?"  It didn't bother me.  But they didn't like me.  They had a caucus in the hotel where they had the neighbor--had this bar set up, and they're telling everybody, "Don't vote for Mr. Guilford, don't vote for Guilford," so that's how I got defeated, so I only did one term.  I missed out on my other, other term.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: But they made a--they regretted it--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --afterwards.  They apologized afterwards.  That was something that they did.

Speaker 1: When did you buy your first shop [Dunbar Barbers, Boston, Massachusetts] now?
Speaker 2: Nineteen thirty-four [1934].
Speaker 1: And where was that located?
Speaker 2: 810 Tremont Street, right across from the Piano--from the Chickering building [Chickering Piano Factory, Boston, Massachusetts] which is now the Piano Craft [Guild] building.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Between Northampton Street--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and Camden Street.
Speaker 1: Were you the sole barber or did you have other barbers working with you?
Speaker 2: I had six chairs, yeah.
Speaker 1: When you first opened?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You had six?
Speaker 2: I bought a shop already established.
Speaker 1: And how long did you keep that--have that business going?
Speaker 2: I kept that up until I went into the [U.S. military] service.  I was drafted in 1942 to go into the service as a quartermaster, [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: You were drafted.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And tell me about your Army experience?  How long did it last and--
Speaker 2: Well, I was in the army--I went overseas, I was drafted, did my basic training at Fort--at Camp Lee which is now Fort Lee [Virginia] for ten weeks and Colonel Rob--Colonel Earl--Colonel Frank [M.] Snowden was the--was the cavalry--was the head of that cavalry of African American or blacks, 'cause it was a segregated army.  And so I went to--I wanted to go to clerical school, but they wouldn't send me to clerical school.  They sent me to a course in sterilization and bath which was an accelerated medical course.  And, and that's because--I said, "Why you send me there?"  He go, "You had so much experience as a barber.  See," they said, "years ago, the barbers were the doctors."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So evidently they must've figured that I know something about people and health, you know, which I do.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But I didn't learn it from being a barber.  I learned it from being in school, studying physiology as a student.  So, anyway, but you had to have at least a high school education to understand what they were getting ready to talk about, because they were talking about different things of the body, the circulatory system, you know, and nervous system and the bones and structure and all like that, and the fact that--what--how people could get diseases and what could be the effect of the diseases on the system right through the digestive system, whatnot.  So, anyway, that course lasted for about ten years.  In the meantime, I was in--I was with a fellow by the name of--a buddy by the name of George Watson.  He and I were together in that particular course.  That's how we became good friends in the Army.  So when we went overseas--so we went over--we didn't go overseas right away.  They sent us to a debark--debarking--de, de, deport--debark--I guess it's debarking camp where you--where you set up--set you up for debarkation in Charleston, South Carolina.  And you stayed there a few days, then they brought us back at night, in a troop ship--a troop train, rather, that was covered, and they brought us back to Virginia to be shipped overseas.  But you got on this ocean voyage called [U.]S.S. Hermitage [AP-54] which was--carried--eventually carried about ten thousand troops and it was a German troop ship that had been captured and made into a troop transport.  And so we went then.  In the meantime, we--I thought we were going overseas to Europe, and I said--but then after we got in the ship, we went south and went through the Panama Canal, and I knew then we were going to South Pacific.  So we stayed on that ship for about two months, and we passed the equator, and then we passed the International Date Line and when--and, of course, we didn't--I didn't get initiated, but we got certificates, but the sailors all got initiated when they crossed this.  Whales and, and the King, King Neptune came aboard and all--they had a--they threw garbage and everything else on 'em, but I didn't--we didn't have to go through that type of initiation.  But anyway, landed in--we--only--we didn't seem to land until we--until we passed New Caledonia, and I saw where they used--off in the distance, you could see some--they use it as a coal for battleships, but we were escorted on the South Pacific--we were escorted on S.S. Hermitage, we went down the coast of South America and crossed over, and we were escorted by a aircraft carrier and several destroyers.  And all the time we were traveling, the aircraft carrier was circling, circling, circling, and everybody was circling, and they'd move very swiftly, because the ocean was loaded with Japanese submarines, and they knew it, but we finally landed safely in Brisbane [Australia], and I said the only land we saw in crossing was that Caledonia island off in the distance.  So, we landed in Brisbane, and then we debarked in Brisbane.  And we went to a staging area in a race track, horse track where horse racing was.  So, that's where we got off.  But in the meantime, going through the Panama Canal, we picked up about two thousand jungle fighters.  Now, these soldiers were picked up to go to fight in New Guinea, so we knew where we were going, eventually.  And they were--they'd been down there for a couple of years, and they had already raised families, and had children, and they were showing us all these pictures of these different women that were their wives and their children on the boat.
Speaker 1: How long did you serve?
Speaker 2: I served from 1942 to 1945.
Speaker 1: Now, what happened to your business while you were away?  Did somebody else carry it on?
Speaker 2: Well, my--I left 'em--there--people in charge, but my mother [Nancy Haskins Guilford] finally closed it down, because they were incompetent.
Speaker 1: Your mother did?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she said, "I put the stuff in storage, put everything in storage," so they were shut down shortly after I left.  They couldn't run it.
Story_ID: 269059
Speaker 1: --Came back to Boston [Massachusetts] after the [U.S. Army] service and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I came back to Boston--
Speaker 1: --and then what--
Speaker 2: --in 1945.
Speaker 1: And then what'd you do?
Speaker 2: Well, after I got back here, I had been wounded, and so I was--I wasn't myself.  I still wasn't capable.  I tried to open up a shop on Columbus Avenue, but I still wasn't myself.  I still was addicted to alcohol, and every time I took a drink I'd pass out, so the doctors told me, said, due to my service, my--what I was being--you know, disability, I wouldn't be able to drink anymore, but I didn't know that.  You see, I was in a position where I went--not only--I didn't finish my story about Australia, but we went to Australia, and we went to Australia on a ship [U.S.S. Hermitage AP-54] that carried pre-cooked Christmas dinners to New Guinea, to the front lines.  Of course, the Coral Sea battle [Battle of the Coral Sea] had been won, and so actually it was just like going on a cruise, 'til we got to New Guinea which is--but New Guinea was devastating, 'cause it's right in the heart of the jungles and the equator and the heat and everything else was there.  But anyway, we stopped off at the Port Moresby [Papua New Guinea] which is the capital, and after we stopped there, we went around to the northern side of the islands and stopped in Milne Bay, but as we got to Milne Bay we supposed--haven't reached the front lines yet.  Well, on the way to the front lines, the big navel--the big airplane battle by the [U.S.] Army Air Force[s] where they had sunk a Japanese convoy, about fifteen thousand troops, and they did this, and they didn't take no prisoners.  So they--this is a--they had--the only way--because when we got to Milne--when we're on our way to Port--well, it happened in Oro Bay, but on my way there, we saw these PT [patrol torpedo] boats with machine guns on 'em.  So what was happening, they were mopping up the people who were in the water, the Japanese, so they didn't take any prisoners; there was nowhere to put 'em anyway.  So that--finally we got to--we never did get to Oro Bay, because in the meantime, the Japanese, they responded to what the Americans had done and they--and their air fleets came over and bombed us and sank our ship.  And that's when George Watson who was with me at the time, he lost his life and saved my life, and he saved about seven, nine or ten other people.  And I don't know whether he got hit in the water, but he was a strong swimmer.  I had a life jacket on, so he saw to it that I got to a raft, see?  But, he went--and then he started bringing back to my raft, I said, "Don't bring no more people back here," (laughter) I said, "'cause this raft was so flimsy."  This is a rope raft and my feet were dangling in the water and that could slide from under us, you know?
Story_ID: 269060
Speaker 1: The new big business that you started after the war [World War II, WWII]--you had a landmark business.  Tell me the name of it, and how you got started and some of the people--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who your customers were.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, after I--before I went in the war, before I went into the [U.S.] Army, I had the--I bought the shop called Dunbar Barbers [Boston, Massachusetts], and as I told before, I stayed there until 1942, when I was drafted.  So during my time in the service, which was over three years, my mother [Nancy Haskins Guilford] closed the shop down shortly after I went into the service, because the people who were running it were inefficient.  She put the--all the equipment into storage.  So I came out of the service in '45 [1945], and I tried to start my business up again, but somehow or another I wasn't capable on account of my injuries in the service, so I had to get myself back together.  And I was a DAV [Disabled American Veteran] and also had got the Purple Heart and so forth.  But I still--I finally got--I got a G.I. [Bill, Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944]] loan for my shop for three thousand dollars.
Speaker 1: G.I. loan?
Speaker 2: Yeah, of three thousand dollars which was allowed to me, and I bought a shop and set it up at 832 Tremont Street [Boston, Massachusetts].  It happened to be a vacant store there where Mr. Grey [ph.] had one time had a barber shop which was run by a man named G.B. Holloway [ph.], but I knew it was a good location, 'cause it was on Tremont Street, and this was the Mecca of black businesses, Tremont Street was.  So, it was a small shop; it only could hold four chairs, but it was a very good spot, and it was on the right side of the street, called the downtown side of the street.  And so knowing that, I bought the shop and set it up with just the money I borrowed (laughter), and I didn't have any extra money, but I should've got some extra money, but I just had enough money to open the shop.  And so I went in there and started barbering, and--'cause I was already well known, so it didn't take me long to build up a clientele and also hire other barbers.  And, of course, I had a time there for a while, because the--it's--well, anyway I had a little trouble with some of the barbers, particularly because I had a time with them, because there's so many places in the area to drink.  And so--and they'd go out--I'd pay them off on Saturdays, and I paid 'em off on Saturdays, one particular barber, as soon as he got his money, he'd go out and visit a bar, and he'd come back.  When he come back, he'd be drunk and then--and it upset the whole shop.  So I finally made a decision not to pay anybody no more on Saturday, so I paid 'em on Mondays, so that was one of the changes I--
Speaker 1: You got away with that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got away.  I changed it over, made it--made it--paid 'em off on Mondays.
Story_ID: 269061
Speaker 1: In 1950, I wanted--oh, I wanted to go back to--I went to law--I went to law school before--while I was at--before I went into the [U.S. Army] service.  I went--that's the college part I did.  I went to Northeastern Law School [Northeastern University School of Law, Boston, Massachusetts] at night after I got my high school diploma.  But I--but due to the fact that I--my time was so--I--we closed the shop so late, I couldn't attend the law school, so I gave that up.  But when I came out the service, I wanted to go back to law school, so they said, "No, don't go back to law school."  They sent me to--they told me to go to beauty college which I finally took.  Well, maybe they made the right decision (laughter).  But anyway, I went to Wilfred's about six months.
Speaker 2: Wilfred's?
Speaker 1: Wilfred's Beauty Shop [Wilfred Academy of Hair and Beauty Culture] on--down at Hamilton's Place in downtown Boston [Massachusetts].  And after I went down to Hamilton Place at downtown Boston, I had--I took up hairdressing, so I didn't stay there too long, because I still couldn't--they wanted me to come there on Fridays or something.  Well, Fridays was the only day that in my barbershop [Jimmy Guilford's Men's Hairstyling Salon, Boston, Massachusetts] that was a busy day, you know?  And so, I gave up that.  I was cutting hair for thirty-five cents and shaving, and if I gave up that, I wouldn't make any money at all, 'cause end of the week, people would start coming to the--get their selves, you know, for the weekend.  So I left there with the knowledge, a lot of knowledge about hairdressing, which I maintained and retained.  So anyway, getting back to that, I came back to Boston--I mean, I came back to my shop, you know--I stayed barbering until--I started visiting New York [New York].
Story_ID: 269062
Speaker 1: Well, one thing I remember.  One of the most famous persons that came to my shop [Jimmy Guilford's Men's Hairstyling Salon, Boston, Massachusetts] at that particular time was Jackie Robinson who had just broken the color barrier for the Major League Baseball team [Brooklyn Dodgers; Los Angeles Dodgers].  And he was brought to me by a baseball customer of mine who owned a major--a semi-pro baseball team called the Boston Tigers.  His name was Bob Russell, and he was close to Shag Taylor on the corner of Kendall [Street] and Tremont Street.  So he brought Jackie Robinson to me to service him.  And for every time Jackie Robinson came to Boston [Massachusetts] after that, with the [Atlanta] Braves which is a National League team, he wasn't with the Braves but the Brooklyn Dodgers, the Braves played in Brooklyn [New York, New York], he'd come to my shop for his haircut.
Speaker 2: Did you and Jackie Robinson have any conversations that you recall?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah.  We had--
Speaker 2: What'd you guys talk about?
Speaker 1: Well, no, no, he didn't talk anything.  He didn't have any conversations with me, 'cause he was a person that come in the shop, he'd sit there and wouldn't say a word to anybody, read his paper, and he got his hair cut, I cut his hair.  He was, you know, real friendly, read it, and then he'd leave, but he wouldn't say--the people would ask him about--now, one thing about it, there's a fellow next door named Eddie Harris [ph.], he had a hat shop, and every time Jackie--he was a drinker--and every time, he'd be half stooged, see, he'd come in there, and if Jackie Robinson had a bad day, he'd come in, "Oh, what happened?"  So I had to run him out of there, see?  But he wouldn't--I wouldn't let anybody disturb him.  But he was going through enough with the problems he had playing in the white league for the--being the first black man to play in the white league.  So, he had all that problem without having someone irritate him outside of his own people, you know?
Speaker 2: How often did he come for a haircut?
Speaker 1: He came every time the Brooklyn Dodgers came, every time, every time.  So we became good friends.  So, as it happened, I'm a golfer, see, so I went south to north and--North & South [Open] golf tournament run by these fellas out of New York in Miami [Florida], so I went down there to play the North & South golf tournament, but he was there with the baseball team doing spring practice in February.  So we were in Miami Springs [Florida] but we didn't have any driving range in Miami Springs, so we had to go to Miami Beach [Florida] to the public course there in Miami Beach to use their golf course, golf--driving range.  So over there, in the meantime--it was called the Bayshore [Municipal] Golf Course [Miami Beach, Florida].  So in the meantime while I'm there, who should I bump into but Jackie Robinson?  So Jackie Robinson said to me, he wanted me to play with--in a foursome with him, not with him but in a four--I had a--he was in one foursome, I was in another foursome.  So in meantime, this--one of his fellow ballplayers took me over to the desk and had me sign in as a guest in front of the hotels; that's the only way I guess I could've played, by being a guest.  So anyway, Jackie Robinson and I, we all got together, and we went on the golf course.  We played eighteen holes.  But after--but the main thing is, after it was over, I didn't realize that it happened.  We were the first black people to play Bay--pay to play at Bayshore and broke the color barrier.
Speaker 2: What year was that (unclear) do you remember when that was?  Fifties [1950s] or?  You started playing golf--how old--
Speaker 1: I started playing golf in the '50s [1950s].  It must've been in the--might've been in the--in the late '50s [1950s].  We broke the color barrier--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at Bayshore.  And another fella there by the name of Dr. Carl [ph.] who came out of Atlanta [Georgia], he broke the color barrier in Atlanta, too.  He was--but I didn't know that he was a golfer that--black golfer that played golf.  He was one of the people that broke the color--so maybe that's why Jackie Robinson got the idea from Dr. Carl.

Speaker 1: To cross (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Who were some of the other quote, famous people who came to your shop [Jimmy Guilford's Men's Hairstyling Salon, Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 1: Well, I had so many come there, it's hard to--well, the first person that came to my shop in 1934 was Jack Johnson, the former heavyweight champion of the world.  Jack Johnson came--he was--coming in to Boston [Massachusetts] to play--do a show at the Old Howard Theatre [Howard Athenaeum, Boston, Massachusetts] down in--which is now Government Center, which is called--what is it called?  Scollay Square.
Speaker 2: Scollay Square.
Speaker 1: It was Scollay Square, but with all the bars and the--and the--it's called--it was called Skid Row at that time, and so Scollay Square was on Howard--it was on Howard Street, they had the burlesque show.  So he did an exhibition down there, which I finally went to see.  But he came in my shop, and he had parked his car over on the corner of Columbus Avenue and Mass [Massachusetts] Avenue and walked over to the shop.  Well, in the meantime, people had seen him.  So he brought a--maybe--I don't know where--they followed him, I guess, to see where he was going.  So, he came to my shop which had a pair of concrete stairs up to the--and I had a big bay window at 810 Tremont Street.  So he walked into the shop and said--see, I was on the first chair, so he said to me, "I want my hair cut, I want a shave, I want a manicure, I want a shoe shine.  I want it all done at the same time."  So, that was no problem, because we also--I had the manicure and things on the side of my barber chair, and my brother was there, had a stool that he sat on to shine shoes while people were getting their hair cut.  But I didn't have a manicurist at the time.  We was gonna have the manicure table in the bay window.  So I called the woman next door, Ms. Arrington [ph.], and told her to come over and do his nails.  So, he got in the chair, and I started working on him, she came over, sat, sat the manicuring up to do his nails, and my brother pulled the chair, brought the stool up to do his feet.
Speaker 2: So it all--
Speaker 1: And then--
Speaker 2: --went on the same time, like an orchestra?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, wait a minute.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He, he said to me--I said, "What, mister, what Mr. Johnson?"  He said, "Turn me around to the window, I want to see my public," (laughter).  So I turned him around to the window so he could see his public, and I proceeded to cut his hair, I shaved his hair, he got his manicure, and my brother shined his shoes.  He got up--so then he got up and told us what's happening while he was here, you know?  So he said--he stood up--he was a specimen--a physical specimen that you wouldn't believe.  The man was in his fifties, or older, and he didn't have an ounce of fat on him.  And so he stood up straight to me, said, "Hit me right here."  So I balled--he said, "Hit me now, don't play--don't--."  I hit my--I balled my fist and hit him like that, and it was just like hitting a brick wall (laughter).  I said, "Oh my God."  So that's the way they tough themselves up.  And so he got up and, of course, I--it's the whole thing that only cost him about two dollars, so I don't remember whether he tipped me, probably not, but it, it cost him--
Speaker 2: Two dollars.
Speaker 1: --but, see the haircut--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the shave only cost him at least fifty cents and the shoeshine was ten cents, and the manicure was about fifty cents, so I'm don't know how much money he spent, but I think he spent--I think he gave us two dollars for everything.
Story_ID: 269064
Speaker 1: Who were some of the jazz musicians--
Speaker 2: Well, that was later on--
Speaker 1: --musicians that, that came.
Speaker 2: --and that became--after I went to Wilfred's [Wilfred Academy of Hair and Beauty Culture, Boston, Massachusetts] and learned how to become a hairdresser to--in the six months, I was a hairdresser, but I learned a lot about it.  So I went to New York [New York], visiting New York, and I saw this hairdresser.  It was just--and he had a shop on the street level, but in the basement, he was doing hair.  And then I went down in the basement.  His name was Frank [ph.].  So I went down in the basement, he had this big tub of looked like lard on the floor and had all this--these men sitting around with their hair covered with this same product.  So then he turned around and was talking, and he took--and then he washed the stuff out of their hair and their hair became straight.  Then, he'd turn around, would cut the hair--well, maybe he cut the hair first, I don't remember, but he'd finger wave the hair--well, not only finger wave, but he'd give them a color, like make it blacker or browner, or whatever color they use as a rinse, and then that'd be done.  Then, he'd set the hair with his hands and put 'em in waves.  And after he put the hair in waves, he put a net on him, and he'd put under the dryer.  So that hair would come out permanently waved.  And then he would--then he would let them go, you know, after he'd put cream on it, the cream rub--we called cream--Wildroot, Wildroot Cream Oil was the thing they used as a--as a finishing product.  So they put that on their hair and combed the hair up, and that was called a 'do.  In other words, it was very popular with men.
Speaker 1: It was called a duke?
Speaker 2: A 'do, yeah.  It was the first time that hair--kinky hair or curly hair was straightened without hot irons.  Madam [C.J.] Walker's the one that used to straighten hair--brought in the--ended up straightening hair with hot irons and curling the hair.  But this is the first time that I saw that, that men was--I didn't know what was happening.  But anyway, it was chemicals that were straightening the hair and then they could use it.  But the only thing about it, it wasn't a permanent straight.  It would stay straight maybe a week or so before it would revert, but that was the beginning.  And so, anyway, I took the product back to Boston [Massachusetts] called Jabra [ph.], and I started buying it directly, regularly from New York, and they--and I had a big tub where I used to make my own pre-straightener.  He says put the pre-straightener in the hair, because it's a Vaseline product mixed with mineral oil, he said put it into the scalp, because the product itself was made out of lye; it was a form of lye, so it would burn, so to keep it from burning the scalp while it was working, you put the pre-straight--Vaseline into the hair and actually get that into the hair.  Then, you straighten the hair, and then you'd wash it out, the hair would be straight.  Then, you could do anything you want with it.  You could wave it, curl it, and--with your hands.
Speaker 1: Who did Malcolm X's hair when he was in Boston?  Did you--
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't do Malcolm X's hair.
Speaker 1: --or somebody--you didn't do Malcolm.
Speaker 2: But the fellow--the barber was called Abbott.  He was--he's a member of our--of our association [Associated Master Barbers and Beauticians of America; Hair International], Abbott, and a fellow named Robert Fogey.  James Abbott, he had a shop on Cabot Street which is no longer there, but which is just adjacent to Dudley Square.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But, you see, Malcolm X at that time, he--they were just beginning the process of doing hair, and they were--they, they--people were using, making their own stuff like lye and mixed with potatoes and all that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They didn't know what they were doing.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And they were--and he--that's one reason why they put the stuff on his hair, he started--remember that he wrote in his biography ['The Autobiography of Malcolm X,' Malcolm X and Alex Haley] about him getting red hair?  Well, that's how he got red hair.  Because that lye burned--
Speaker 1: Burned it.
Speaker 2: --made his hair turn red.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: It took all the color out of the--out of the hair.
Story_ID: 269065
Speaker 1: The picture that I have in my book of you working on Sugar Ray Robinson--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --did you do his hair, or?
Speaker 2: No, I did his hair at--I didn't do his hair, but he came to my shop [Jimmy Guilford's Men's Hairstyling Salon, Boston, Massachusetts] and, and I think--I don't know whether--I might've--I might've done his hair but he had his own hairdresser with him by the name of Rogers [Simon]; he traveled with him.  He traveled with a whole, whole entourage, you know?  He had--traveled with nine, ten people.
Speaker 1: But they came to your shop, though?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he--oh, he came to my shop, yeah.  And I--and I would stand behind and maybe I might've--but I have--I have the--I didn't do his hair.  I have to think.  I might've, I don't know.  I can't remember.  But he came there that one time and he came there with his fuchsia Cadillac and everything, you know?
Speaker 1: What about Duke Ellington?  Did you--
Speaker 2: Well, Duke Ellington is one I did regularly.  I was his personal barber when he--in fact, the people that came to Boston [Massachusetts] like Nat [King] Cole, Duke Ellington, and Oscar Peterson, Erroll Garner.  I did Dinah Washington's hair, Dinah Washington, Sarah Vaughan's hair, and all the--and, and, I can't remember, so many more.
Speaker 1: Billie Holiday?  Was she--
Speaker 2: Well, Billie Holiday was a friend of mine, and I was a--I was with her the week before she died.  I happened to be the one who was told to take her out and give her some fun, because she was sick.  So, Erroll Garner was here, and he had stayed here, so I asked him why he was here, he said he came here because Billie was sick, and she needed some help.  So, I don't know that she--'cause she was a convicted drug addict.  And so, I don't know whether he helped her get some more dope or not, because her husband [Louis McKay] had left her stranded, see, and she was sick.  So, anyway, I saw her every night that she performed at (unclear) and Storyville [Boston, Massachusetts] the whole time, but I knew her anyway from the time she started up with Count Basie, see, as a--as one of his singers.
Speaker 1: How did you get to know her then?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew Count Basie, I knew her.  I used to attend all their affairs.  I was--I was a night owl, you know?  I was a playboy (laughter).
Speaker 1: In Boston?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was--I was at all their affairs.  I was at everything they--every time Count Basie came to Boston, any musician, Duke Ellington, Jimmie Lunceford, Cab Calloway, any of them--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --who came to Boston, I was there.
Speaker 1: Where did they perform in Boston--
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: --in those days?  All these people that you--these--
Speaker 2: Well, some--well, some of 'em performed--a lot of 'em performed at Storyville.  Then, a lot of 'em came to the vaudeville places like, like Metropolitan Theatre which is now the Wang Center [sic. Wang Theatre, Boston, Massachusetts], (unclear), and, and, and different places like that they--that came to Boston at various times.  Then, someone came just for dances, Jimmie Lunceford and even Duke came for just dances.  And they had (unclear) building where they used to have black dancers over there, but they didn't--they couldn't really get the big calls for black dancers.  There's a man named Clement Thorne, used to book for this guy who had the monopoly on all the downtown at the little building, I forget his name, but he allowed Clement Thorne to book his--book shows.  And, and they used a placed called (unclear) auditorium which was a converted church to a dance hall with that on--down there at--in--on Tremont Street down there near--just before you get into where the--where, where the-Cyclorama [Boston Center for the Arts, Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know where you mean, the left-hand side?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It actually would be a famous place for theaters, too--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --real theaters, at one time.  There used to be a theater down there with a lot of performing white--stage people used to work.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But I can't name the people.  All the doctors; I had movie stars, Frank Sivero who, who was a movie star.  He was one of them, Ralph Coleman [ph.] and Herbie Jackson [ph.], and all the doctors, doctors--Dr. Garland [ph.].  (Unclear) was one of my customers, and Dr. Garland and my own doctor, Dr. J.B. Hall [John B. Hall].  And, I can't--I can't--
Speaker 1: Well, that's, that's quite a--
Speaker 2: Oh, Shag Taylor.
Speaker 1: That's quite a collection of--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --celebrity people--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in Boston.
Speaker 2: I had all--anybody--I can't remember.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I had Marlon Brando's son came in.  Lorne Greene's son [Charles Greene] was, was going to BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] at my time.  He came in.  He was recommended to me.  I had people come--recommended to me from all--make appointments all the way from California that they're coming into Boston.
Story_ID: 269066
Speaker 1: I tried the appointment system for haircuts, and then people got angry because, "I don't want to make an appointment for a haircut," but now they--everybody wants an appointment, because I never had my shop [Jimmy Guilford's Men's Hairstyling Salon, Boston, Massachusetts] crowded.  See, my shop was, you walk in, your appointment, you were there.  There was no--we didn't have five or six people waiting around for--
Speaker 2: Oh, I see.
Speaker 1: --for the haircuts.  I wouldn't--didn't--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --didn't have no room for that.
Speaker 2: Unlike that system.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I started another system, too.
Speaker 2: Oh, what was that?
Speaker 1: That was the assembly system for doing hair.  After I washed the hairs out, after the barbers got through working on the hair, applying the chemicals, I had assistants that take 'em to the sink and wash 'em out and put the color in and treat the hair and bring 'em back to the barber.  In the meantime, there'd be another customer in my chair, called the assembly system.
Speaker 2: Called the what system?
Speaker 1: Assembly system.
Speaker 2: Assembly.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What they do now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I brought that to Boston [Massachusetts].  I brought the straightener to Boston, the chemicals to Boston in 1950.
Story_ID: 269067
Speaker 1: Tell me about your other love and that was painting.  You've been a painter--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --and when did you start painting and--
Speaker 2: Well, that started (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Have you--
Speaker 2: --that started during the war [World War II, WWII].  I was--I always could draw.  In the school, I was--I could draw.  You know, I knew I could draw.  But that was--had nothing to do, so when I went in the [U.S] Army, I always get magazines and draw.  So, I was drawing.  Then, I think I got in contact with an artist in--while I was in Australia, and he gave me some encouragement.  So anyway, when I came back to Boston [Massachusetts] and I started my [barbershop] business again, then I--I don't know, I was--I, I, I was--yeah, at eight--at 832 [Tremont Street] right across the street was the Chickering building [Chickering Piano Factory; Piano Craft Guild, Boston, Massachusetts].  They had converted that into an artist colony.  So there's a woman on the top floor who was an artist, and she was the one--I went--I used to go--not only did I visit her, but I visited all the different artists, so I said, "I could do that."  I said, "I could do that, I could do that."  But the funny part about it, I didn't do it, see?  But when I moved into the Brook House in Brookline Village [Brookline, Massachusetts] and I got married, it was in 1965, something like that, I needed to--I looked in the walls and all these bare walls, so--I looked out the window, and I said--and I remember being--what I saw--so, I bought myself a big canvas about five feet by four feet. But before I did that, I drew a picture of what I saw on a big paper, big large paper book.  So then I did that.  I had this whole village of--for me, of Brookline Village, all in charcoal, all in--so when I did that, I transposed it.  I learned something about transposing, so I transposed that picture into this big blank--big canvas, three feet or four feet by five feet, and it looked so good, I didn't know how to paint.  I said, "I'm gonna paint it" (laughter).  So rather than paint it, I left it like it was.  So I went back to paint it and I started taking lessons in painting at the--at the Boston Central [sic. Boston Center for Adult Education, Boston, Massachusetts]--was it Boston--adult center on Commonwealth Avenue, and that's where I started painting.  And they taught me how to paint and do landscapes.  Then I got good at landscapes, then I started doing portraits.  Then I got--then I went to a portrait by the--by, by the name, Mr. Chickering, his name, Mr. Chickering.  He taught me how to do portraits, and I could draw better than he could.
Speaker 1: Are you still painting today?
Speaker 2: Not now, I kind of slowed down on it, on account of my asthma.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But anyway, I took that same drawing which I've charcoaled, and I framed it, and I never, never did paint it, because I was afraid to paint it.  I'm still afraid to paint.  No, I would--I could paint it now, but I wouldn't--it's such a good rendition of the village that I've got it--and I've got prints and everything made of it, you know?  But I got it framed, and I have it in--I gave it to my--who'd I give it to?  I think I gave it to my--I think I gave it to my nephew.  But I have a--I have prints of it just to save--
Speaker 1: When did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But that--I started that in '68 [1968].
Story_ID: 269068
Speaker 1: What really made me start painting was joining the Boston Afro American artists group [Boston African American Artists Association] which was called the Boston Negro Artists group [Boston Negro Artists Association] at the time.  But then I got into them--my business experience, I helped them do more promotions, 'cause I had the knowledge of how to run a business.  So they were just, you know, running the little shows every now and then up the Horatio [Harris] Park up in--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But rather than--and I went up there one time with nobody there and I was there by myself.  I said, I can't go through this.  After lugging all my--half my studio up there and then sitting--ready to--getting ready to sit down, so I became a portrait artist.  I sit--people sit in front of me and I would do their portraits, you know, in chalk.
Speaker 2: [James] Marcus Mitchell, Marcus Mitchell was part of that, wasn't he?
Speaker 1: Marcus Mitchell was very good, yeah.  He was the treasurer--no, he was the--I think he was the--he might've been the treasurer too at one--he was very active.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Marcus Mitchell was very active--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --with the group.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I remember going to a couple of those shows way back.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah.  He--Marcus Mitchell was a very--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He's with--what's the school session here with--the school--
Speaker 2: Boy, he's been--
Speaker 1: --setup?
Speaker 2: --retired now for--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's--
Speaker 2: --a number of years.
Speaker 1: --yeah.  But anyway--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He was with the school that--where the kids go to out of state out--
Speaker 2: METCO [Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity, Boston, Massachusetts], METCO.
Speaker 1: METCO, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he worked there--
Speaker 1: He worked--METCO, yeah.
Speaker 2: --for a long time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, METCO.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, anyway, I brought him--I went to--I was--anyway, I went into a show which was promoted in the Prudential Center [Boston, Massachusetts] which this woman had to be--had to be--what you call, had to be--they ask you for your credentials ahead of time.  So, I forget the name--I forget what they say.  Anyway, I was admitted, so I was doing portraits there in pastel in the corridor of the--if you've ever been to Prudential building, they have a large corridor there.  That whole corridor was lined up with booths, and she was very strict.  She said--she'd tell me, you have to stay by your booth.  You can't be running around, you know (laughter).  So you had to stay there and do your work.  So I did very well there.  So, I said, "Well, I'm with the Boston American Artists."  So in the meantime, I said, "Well, I'll get them to have this show--come do a show there."  But I went there to the Prudential, they wouldn't give it to me.  So, I went to the park department at the City of Boston [Massachusetts] and they gave me the Copley Square area.  So that was the first time anybody had taken that area and had an outdoor show there.  So we had an outdoor show there regularly every year.
Speaker 2: Right, I remember.
Speaker 1: And we had to get our grant from the City of Boston--
Speaker 2: I remember that.
Speaker 1: --for sponsorship, so we used to give prizes and everything else and have an outdoor show there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So that's what I--and then, then I did a lot of painting.  One of my paintings I did there was of [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] one time was, was a--it wasn't there, but I had an exhibit in South Boston [Boston, Massachusetts].  It was at the--I think it might've been at the Expo Center [Boston Convention and Exhibition Center, Boston, Massachusetts], somewhere over there.  It might've been--no, it might've been at--I don't know exactly where it was, but they saw--the people in Cambridge [Massachusetts] saw the picture of Martin Luther King that I did, so they bought it from me and put in the Martin Luther King library [sic. Cambridge Public Library, Central Square Branch] in Cambridge; it's there now.
Speaker 2: It's there now?
Speaker 1: An oil painting about three feet by three feet.  But I didn't sell 'em--charge a whole lot but I took the--I let 'em have it, because I wanted the publicity--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and the honor of having our picture in the library.
Story_ID: 269069
Speaker 1: Coming back to your barbering business, when did you finally retire and stop barbering, close your shop [Jimmy Guilford's Men's Hairstyling Salon, Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: I haven't stopped barbering.
Speaker 1: Well, but I mean, you went out of the business, the big business.
Speaker 2: Well, I went out of the business after Boston Redevelopment company [Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA)] came and took everything in south--in the Lower Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] eminent domain.
Speaker 1: Urban development.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And so they took my business.  I had to move out of the building I was in, because I didn't own the building.  I couldn't buy it.  It was owned by a family called Beckerman [ph.], and they had had it for years, and they weren't thinking about giving up that property, 'cause I talked to Ms. Beckerman about that time and she said, "Oh, no, this is the one that's keeping me--paying my bills." She's making about ten thousand dollars a year income off that one building, and everything in there was leased, and we took care of the building, you know, problems, put--I put a new front on the building and everything else.  So anything that was wrong, we had to fix it, except they took care of like the water, plumbing or something like that major or the roof.  But they didn't have anything to spend on it.  They didn't spend anything on the building.  The only thing she do is collect the money (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So you are still barbering, and I think you mentioned some people, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But anyway, I had to shut down on account of--and they, they wanted me to relocate me up in the Grove Hall [Boston, Massachusetts] area, but that was too far away from my--if I got up there, I'd be isolated.  I wouldn't--people wouldn't be able to find me.  My customers weren't just the local people.  My customers came from all over the United States at the time, so if I went--I was on a main street, and everybody knew where Tremont Street was, and it was easy.  It was very accessible from any point.  So, I just--I just decided to quit, you know.  I didn't try to relocate.
Story_ID: 269070
Speaker 1: Well you said earlier you were born in, in 1911--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and you're ninety-five years old.
Speaker 2: Not yet.
Speaker 1: Not yet?
Speaker 2: I'll be on October 7th.
Speaker 1: October, okay, this year.  How have you lived so long and so vibrantly?  How do you account for your very long life, and you're still active--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --and still playing golf and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well one thing, my father [James Guilford, Sr.] was a very active person, even though he died of cancer.  He was a very active person, and my mother [Nancy Haskins Guilford] lived to be ninety, and she was a person that got up early in the morning and was very active up until she died, and my father was very active.  So, I think it was, they were both young and they gave me good genes and--and they gave me good genes.  So, anyway, I have cousins--my mother lived to be ninety on her side of the family, but I have cousins on my father's side that lived to be ninety-eight, and he--in fact, he was John Walker [ph.].  He lived with us for a while.  He--but he went back to Brooklyn [New York, New York]--
Speaker 1: But I suspect keeping busy all the time, still cutting hair also keeps you--keeps you in shape?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't do--well, I stayed very active. That's the main thing.  I never--I always have something new to do.
Speaker 1: And you travel.
Speaker 2: I travel.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I drive my own car and I play golf.  And I have a Bowflex at my house.
Speaker 1: Have a what?
Speaker 2: A Bowflex--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --exercise machine.
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: And I use that--I've used that constantly.  Not used it--I don't use it much now, but I haven't because I had a little trouble with my back, but I'll get back on it again and I have other exercising machines that I use.  And I also do tai chi.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I do meditations which I learned from Dr. [Herbert] Benson who started his program at the Deaconess Hospital [Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts].
Story_ID: 269071
Speaker 1: How do you feel, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [James] Guilford, about the way you've led your life?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I lived it very well, 'cause--but, I did regret not being able to go to college, but then again, I've accomplished a lot.  When I was in the [U.S. Army] service, I found I knew a lot more than some of the college people knew (laughter).  Before my--background--'cause the [Boston] Latin School [Boston, Massachusetts] gave me my good start.
Speaker 1: Foundation, yeah.
Speaker 2: Foundation, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I always said that anything I can conceive, I can achieve.
Story_ID: 269072
Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?  What do you want people to say about you?
Speaker 2: Well, the only thing I want to say is that I was a good person, and I lived a very exciting life, and if I die, I don't want anybody to be sorry for me.
