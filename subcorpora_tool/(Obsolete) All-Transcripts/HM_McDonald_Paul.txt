Speaker 1: All right, and your place of birth?
Speaker 2: Chicago, Illinois.
Story_ID: 440805
Speaker 1: Let's start, I'm going to get into your parents' background a little and see just how much you know or can remember of that.
Speaker 2: Well, my--my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The mother's name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Josephine Harper McDonald.
Speaker 1: And Harper was a middle name?
Speaker 2: Harper was her last name.
Speaker 1: I mean the maiden name.
Speaker 2: Yeah, maiden name.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your, her, her place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her place of birth was Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay, you know the town?
Speaker 2: You know, I have to get back to you on that.
Speaker 1: That's fine.
Speaker 2: For some reason I can't remember, it's so long ago (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's fine, right, right. And, and your mother's date of birth?
Speaker 2: Mother's date of birth was May 12th, 1901.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your mother is deceased now?
Speaker 2: Yes she is.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember the date of that--
Speaker 2: Of her death?
Speaker 1: --passing, yes.
Speaker 2: It was, it was October 28th, 1984.
Speaker 1: All right, okay. And I'm going to ask you about how far you can take us back on your mother's side of the family tree. Let's begin with your mother's mother and then your mother's father.
Speaker 2: My, my mother's mother was born into slavery.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she married Russell [Russell Harper] who was a half white man.
Speaker 1: Okay, what, what was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Mama [Rosa Harper], I couldn't--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: But, but Mama was the last name?
Speaker 2: Well, no, her, her name was Harper (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, right, right.
Speaker 2: Grandmother's name was Harper.
Speaker 1: Okay, what, and you could not remember her first name?
Speaker 2: But I don't know what her, her first, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was always told she was Mama.
Speaker 1: Okay, good enough. And, you can't recall the place of birth and the date of birth?
Speaker 2: Well, my grandmother was born into slavery so I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I think that she had some psychological problems from, you know, having a good life after being born into slavery and so I never really knew anything about my grandmother except for she was a homemaker and she was very, very close to my mother--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) who was born in, in 1901.
Story_ID: 440806
Speaker 1: Grandma Harper [Rosa Harper] was married to--
Speaker 2: To Russell.
Speaker 1: To Russell--
Speaker 2: Right, Harper (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Harper.
Speaker 2: And Russell Harper was, he was a mixed race, African American black, a white man.
Speaker 1: All right, and we don't have any information or can't recall?
Speaker 2: Well, Russell was a community politician because he was so light-skinned, sometime they thought that he was a white man.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, so he--
Speaker 1: Now, now was that in, in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, no, that was in the South and in Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll just say some place in Alabama.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and approximately, his date of birth?
Speaker 2: Well, if my mother [Josephine Harper McDonald] was born in 18--1901, he, he, I believe was, so I'll say about 1860, '65 [1865], '70 [1870] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm that makes sense, right, okay. We'll use that for, we'll use that for, for now. And did your mother or grandmother relate any stories to you about how they met or what life was like during those, was--
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) early slave- slavery or post-slavery?
Speaker 2: Well, I, everything that I heard was from, through my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grandmother died when I was an infant baby, in, in 1949.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I believe she died in June or July of 1949. I was born in February--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --so the, my only trip down south was to go to my grandmother's funeral.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: There was a tragedy being down there. The family house, some people came in and squatted there and so it no longer belonged to my mother's family. And so that was a traumatic experience that my mother said that she experienced bringing me down there and having to stay at some people's house because she thought that that was her family house and found some other people had squatted on it and so she lost the family house.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so that's what I remember her telling me--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and how tough it was, the family had it because of the fact that racism was alive and well, or may I say, Jim Crow-ism and so they, they learned how to deal with it because Russell, my grandfather, was a craftsman and, like I said, sometimes he would act like a white man--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --until they found out and he did whatever it took to survive.
Speaker 1: Right, right. Now, the family that camped in on the family home of your grandmother and grandfather, were they white squatters or--
Speaker 2: White squatters (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) squatters, and so--
Speaker 2: They said it belonged to them.
Speaker 1: Right, so it would be very difficult, you had to have absolute--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and my mother--
Speaker 1: --air tight pro--
Speaker 2: --and my mother is now a Chicagoan so she got on the next train and we went back to Chicago and she said, "God bless those," and so that was it.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah, I think your mother made a very wise decision.
Speaker 2: I think so too.
Speaker 1: The, I'm sure you don't remember anything about your grandmother's funeral?
Speaker 2: No I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay. Let's, let's go now to your grandfather, Russell.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And how much do you know his family background?
Speaker 2: The only thing I know about his family background was that he was a free black man with white skin.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And, and that he made money by any means necessary. He was a card shark and he, and he sometimes role-played as a, whatever it took. They said that Russell sometimes acted like he owned the town and so he had a lot of people thinking that anything that he did was, he would have people fighting against each other and then he'd get out of the way, so, and especially his enemies.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So he knew who his enemies were and so he thought that racists needed to be exposed and so he was somebody that knew how to expose others who were trying to do harm to the black community. And so Russell, he had his own newspaper that he printed up in longhand and he would overtake or overhear conversations and he would make sure that he would get the names right, the culprits who was about to hurt black people, so--
Speaker 1: Okay, right.
Speaker 2: And so they couldn't understand how come he, that kind of information would make it to people 'cause he would be in the back room and because of his real white skin, they thought he was a white man but he was in there actually as an intelligence person for the black community.
Speaker 1: Right, right, and Russell and your grandmother, their entire life was, lived in Alabama (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the South, in the same house.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, let's go back now to, and I want to be sure that I did get, we said Russell's birthdate was somewhere around 1860s--
Speaker 2: Sixty [1860], something like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and so forth.
Story_ID: 440807
Speaker 1: Let's go back to your earliest memories of your mother [Josephine Harper McDonald] and father [Frederick McDonald, Sr.].
Speaker 2: Well, the first thing is that when I was born, my father was fifty--fifty-four and my mother was forty-eight.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I had, my, my next siblings, next to me, even though I was the last of fourteen children, my sister, she's five years older than me and then another sister is ten years older than I and then other brothers and sisters, right now, are, are passing away.  They're in their eighties and things like that so I'm from another era. I just came late so I can be part of the 21st century.
Speaker 1: Right, let's, let's do something. Let's go ahead and see if you could name those, those siblings, your being the youngest one, so let's start with the, with the oldest sibling.
Speaker 2: Well the oldest sibling was the most famous one because he was supposed to be the one that was going to lead us into the Promise Land. His name was Frederick Douglas McDonald, Jr. [Frederick McDonald, Jr.] and he was shot and killed in 1948. He owned a funeral home and some hoodlums were having a shootout and they saw fit to go into the funeral home and shoot at each other and a bullet hit Freddie and he died.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was Frederick's date of birth?
Speaker 2: Freddie probably was born in 1920-something.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the, he was born in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: He was born in Rockford, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay, Rockford, which is just outside of--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and he was the oldest.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was, that was my father's oldest son--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but this was not my mother's son, this is her stepson--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and then there was Mildred [Mildred McDonald].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mildred was my father's second child.
Speaker 1: Okay, and her date of birth if you know it?
Speaker 2: Probably two or three years after Freddie, so probably sometime in the twenty- 1920s.
Speaker 1: Okay, and is Mildred deceased or is she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, she died in, in 1990, 1990, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay, and was Mildred also a child of your mother's?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was, again, my father's child.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Three were born to my, to my father's first wife--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and eleven was born to my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, so coming down from the oldest to the youngest, the third oldest?
Speaker 2: That child died in early, probably in the first year of his life.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was her name?
Speaker 2: His, his name.
Speaker 1: His name?
Speaker 2: And it throws me right now but I, I can get that to you.
Speaker 1: We'll come back to it. Okay, and that child is deceased?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, approximate year?
Speaker 2: Well, the first year of life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's why I can't, I don't want to do unjustice of, so I'll just get you that name if you need it.
Speaker 1: Okay, good enough. And--
Speaker 2: And now--
Speaker 1: --was, was that child born in Chicago or Alabama?
Speaker 2: It prob- probably born in Rockford, also (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In Rockford, okay.
Speaker 2: --because when my father married my mother, they lived in, they lived in Chicago.
Story_ID: 440808
Speaker 1: Now we're at the third, fourth child (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fourth one, yeah, and, and that was my brother, Ellis Reed [Ellis McDonald].
Speaker 1: Ellis Reed, and that Reed is spelled?
Speaker 2: R-E-E-D.
Speaker 1: R-E-E-D.
Speaker 2: McDonald.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: He had a very colorful life in the sense that he had twenty-two kids--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --and he was, he was the, he was one of the smartest young men in the 20th century. He graduated from Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois] and had fifteen kids with all straight A's--
Speaker 1: That's amazing.
Speaker 2: --and I read, I read about him when I was in Virginia in the [U.S. military] service and I said, this is my brother. He was valedictorian at Roosevelt University with fifteen kids.
Speaker 1: Let's, let's go to, that was the first child between your mother [Josephine Harper McDonald] and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, my mother, right.
Speaker 1: --and so the birth place was Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or it could have been Rockford [Illinois], too, because they lived in Rockford before, so, a number of young people were born there.
Speaker 1: Right, do you know the date of birth--
Speaker 2: Of Ellis?
Speaker 1: --of Ellis?
Speaker 2: Well, he died in 2003. I believe Ellis was seventy-eight, seventy-five, something like that when he passed away.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that would make him 1928?
Speaker 2: Some- something like that. A lot of kids early.
Speaker 1: Right, and Ellis, you said, had twenty-five children?
Speaker 2: Twenty-two.
Speaker 1: Twenty-two children?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and fifteen of them had straight A's?
Speaker 2: Well, no, the, Ellis, when he went back to school, he went to Roosevelt University and he had, at the time, he would work during the daytime to go to school and he got straight A's and was valedictorian at Roosevelt University, probably in 1969.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Now, after Ellis, your mother and father [Frederick McDonald, Sr.] had, they had another child?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Rosella [Rosella McDonald], Rosella.
Speaker 1: R-O-S-E-L-L-A?
Speaker 2: Something close.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Rosella, Rosella.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it's R-O-S-E, ella.
Speaker 1: Right, okay, and is Rosella still alive?
Speaker 2: She died last year.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you know Rosella's date of birth?
Speaker 2: When they were before me, I know that they (laughter), it's probably the '40s [1940s], probably the nine--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --probably the early, or late '30s [1930s], late '30s [1930s]. I believe probably the late '30s [1930s].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now we put down Ellis, 1928. Would there--
Speaker 2: Maybe a little bit earlier, I, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay, but--
Speaker 2: --during that period of time, I knew when their birthdays were but I never knew how old they were.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: They were much, much older than I. So I looked at 'em when they came in as brothers and sisters from afar. They didn't grow up with me.
Speaker 1: Do you know Rosella's month and date of birth?
Speaker 2: I, I really--
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: --people would tell me and give me some candy (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's challenging when I ask these questions, so--
Speaker 2: You, you got, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --I recognize that.
Speaker 2: Well you know, these weren't my siblings that was, you know, in, in, within ten years of me--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --so when I met them, they were grown and I looked up at them and people say, that's your brother or sister, and then I see them leave out and go home to their families, so (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --it was kind of challenging to, to know when their birthdays were 'cause they were old enough, a lot of them to be my parent.
Story_ID: 440809
Speaker 1: Now, Rosella [Rosella McDonald], who followed Rosella?
Speaker 2: After, after Rosella, was my brother Isaac [Isaac McDonald], maybe, no, Margie, maybe Margie, I might have their, their date of births mixed up but Margie and, I think, I believe Isaac was next.
Speaker 1: Okay, Margie was M-A-R-G-I-E?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Marjorie [Marjorie McDonald], Marjorie. I know that all I knew her as, was Margie, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, and we'll use that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And are we sure that the children were, the family was living in Chicago [Illinois] by then (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, we were living in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay, the, and I'm sure Marjorie's birthdate was so long before you were born--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --so you may not know that?
Speaker 2: Well, she passed away in 1980.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Now, following Margie, where we are--
Speaker 2: Was, was Isaac, Isaac, my, my brother, Isaac, and then Jimmie [Jimmie McDonald].
Speaker 1: Okay, I'll put Jimmie down here. Just a little bit about Isaac. Is Isaac still living now?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and was, I think he was born in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And any sense of a birthdate for him?
Speaker 2: Well, I believe Isaac is seventy-two so if you can go back (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Certainly, certainly, we will go back and say that, 1935. And now we're talking about Jimmie--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Jimmie was born maybe two, a year and a half after Isaac was born.
Speaker 1: Okay, and is Jimmie still alive?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. And now we're close to getting up into the '40s [1940s].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: After Jimmie?
Speaker 2: After Jimmie, Gloria [Gloria McDonald], my sister Gloria.
Speaker 1: Okay, and is Gloria still alive?
Speaker 2: Yes she is.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I'm sure that was Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yes, and she's ten years older than I.
Speaker 1: Okay, so 1939, and then following, following Gloria?
Speaker 2: Evelyn [ph.].
Speaker 1: Evelyn.
Speaker 2: She's five years older than I.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're going to say 1944, and she is still alive?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, one, two, three, four--okay, we're at number eleven and so we need twelve and thirteen.
Speaker 2: Well I believe both of them passed away and I don't know when their birth order, when they passed away, but, but my mother [Josephine Harper McDonald] and my father [Frederick McDonald, Sr.] had eleven children and I might have mis- put somebody out of my mind (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.
Speaker 2: And my father had fourteen and my mother had eleven.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was the fourteenth of my father's and eleventh of my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. I'll just leave those open.
Speaker 2: I'll find those doors (laughter).
Speaker 1: Good enough, good enough.
Story_ID: 440810
Speaker 1: I believe we, we did your dad's [Frederick McDonald, Sr.] date of birth and ne- let me--
Speaker 2: Eighteen- 1895.
Speaker 1: Eight- 1895, right. What are the earliest years you can remember of, as a child, being with your mom [Josephine Harper McDonald] and dad?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I, it was an event. It was Emmett Till's funeral, you know, I can remember a lot of things but I think I kind of remember my first real event was going to Emmett Till's funeral.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was six years old in 1955--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and I think that changed my life going to Emmett Till's funeral. I think, at six years old, I didn't quite understand what happened to that young man that was, I can almost remember where I was sitting at, it was the way that the church [Roberts Temple Church of God in Christ, Chicago, Illinois] was set up, the seats went up and I can remember sitting in a, in a seat at the end and I could look down on the platform, or stage, and I, I was hearing a lot of sadness that led up to it 'cause my mother was the willing worker and she was a saint and my father, being an evangelist, it was a lot of turmoil at the house because it was anger and it was sadness and it was anger and even sometimes, though my brothers and sisters were talking about killing some folks and it was, it was kind of strange because I didn't know what they were talking about but I had never seen it in my six years nothing but sereneness around me and something happened and what I, what I understood happened was when I was at the funeral and I saw all these ministers come on stage and I couldn't remember not one of their speeches but it was almost like there was some, some animals out in the garage somewhere and they were saying that some animals got to him and they tore him all to pieces and, you know, that's how he looked 'cause they had the casket open, I remember.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I remember my father, he gave me something to think about. He said, what is going to be your future if a man could come into a relative's house and take them--him out, and do this type of damage to a young boy and the government thinks it's completely okay during that period of time. And so, I didn't know what that meant. I, I asked my father during that period of time, does it mean that you can't protect me from that? 'Cause that was the question because, you mean, that there are human beings, it got to be a monster. During that period of time there was a TV show called, 'Shock Theatre' and I tried to equate what happened to Emmett Till with 'Shock Theatre.' It must be a Frankenstein that's loose and did they get him and so it's a lot of things that happened and a lot of education that I got months after that. In fact, the education was so intense because I wanted to find those animals and eradicate them because I didn't want any more little kids like that assassinated by grownups. And so that's what, 'cause I wanted to know, was it another kid? I wanted to know who was it that could take a child's life like that and it didn't mat- I didn't, I know what being bad was all about at that time, at six years old, but how could you be that bad with someone that can take your life and cut you all up and put you in a, in a swamp and bloat you up and, that like that?
Story_ID: 442163
Speaker 1: You were horrified at that funeral because of the sights and sounds of that period. Many of the people at that funeral, I'm sure, felt and expressed what you were feeling there. So, do you want to continue with that feeling or did you want to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I, I think, I think that, that feeling was as if for the first time that I didn't feel safe. When you have a mother [Josephine Harper McDonald] and father [Frederick McDonald, Sr.], especially older parents, they were like your incubator. They made sure that you felt good. Your brothers and sisters, being much older than yourself, they were like my surrogate parents, so I would go out with them and I felt safe and I think after that funeral and it seemed like there was a sense that it wasn't, I didn't understand color but the people that were speaking at the funeral seemed like they had no control over the destiny and I, I probably, actualized that maybe a few years later because I was so determined to fight that monster that I, I told my father that I wanted to be a minister. And so, I, I think I practiced at six years old that I was going to get up and I was going to, I was going to speak to the, the people at the church and I, they, I asked for some time to get up and preach. And they, I, I could remember moving from side to side and watching people's eyes and somehow it got exciting for me to get up there and talking. I don't know if I knew what I was talking about but I saw women, you know, shouting, I saw people falling on the ground and I decided that it was too much power. At that moment I said I would not be a minister because I could not understand that kind of power that just by saying some encouraging words, I had to do it, so at six I wanted to write about people. And so, my father gave me a journal to write about why do people, through other people, get excited when they say something that's inspirational. It doesn't mean that I really mean it but I can excite people with what I say to them and that scared me. I had a gift at that time that I could excite people about the future, about what we had to do and I would, I would try to transform myself into somebody who was a leader. And so, it became a challenge for me to learn as much as I could about who might be those people that did that to Emmett Till.
Speaker 1: So you could not express yourself there at that funeral but your, your father gave you a diary--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in which (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And a book to read.
Speaker 1: --and, okay.
Speaker 2: And the book had on it 1888--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and it was my [maternal] grandfather [Russell Harper], had written it and he had written it and he had written it in longhand and he had written it with symbols, with pictures, and was really easy to read because it would have a, a paragraph and then it would have a definition and then it would have a symbol or picture of it. And what he was doing was drawing a diagram of an institution. So, so he was the first one in 1888 got me to understanding that if we're going to win as a people, that we have to be institution builders and then, I guess, the balance came because I never really let on to, between six and ten, that there was something wrong out there that I saw our people experiencing. I, I couldn't, I had no dialogue on why I felt like there was a difference in the land.
Story_ID: 442164
Speaker 1: But at ten, I think that's when a whole new something came into my life that really, really confused me and that was meeting [HistoryMaker] Ernie Banks, Mr. Cub, hall of famer--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --when I was ten. He lived in the neighborhood. He lived down the street in a big mansion 'cause, you know, you had the doctor's children, you had the, you know, the preacher's children and then you had the athlete, living down the street--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and I met him in 1959 and I didn't understand baseball at the time.
Speaker 2: You were ten years old?
Speaker 1: I was ten years old and he had just won the Most Valuable Player Award for the second straight year and I didn't know what that meant but I met him at one of my childhood friends, Gregory Adam's [ph.] house. Gregory Adam's father was a Pullman porter and one day I went into my friend's house, we were about the same age, went to grammar school [Harvard Elementary School; Harvard School of Excellence, Chicago, Illinois] together, and when I, there was a man sitting in the house with Gregory Adam's father and he was, had a cheerful smile on his face and he said, "How do you do?" And I said, "I'm fine." And so he said, "I live right across the way." He said, "Do you like baseball?" I said, "Well, I think it's boring." And so, he said, "It is not boring," he said, "it's great," you know, and he went into his Ernie Banks act. And so, we made a date with Gregory Adam's father and Gregory and myself going to Wrigley Field [Chicago, Illinois]. You have to understand, that I've been to the North Side with my father [Frederick McDonald, Sr.] before and, and, but I never seen the Wrigley Field, never been on the North Side of Chicago [Illinois] where we went and I've been on Lake Shore Drive but I didn't go around the bend on Lake Shore Drive where the oceans [sic. Lake Michigan] and the beaches and just, just accumulation of white people going to Wrigley Field.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now you got to understand, I'm in Ernie Banks' car, ten years old and in the car was Gregory on the other side and, and Gregory's father sitting in the front seat, and all of a sudden we're going towards Wrigley Field and I'm looking out the window and I'm seeing young white faces smiling at me. Now this wasn't right now 'cause I had already said that white folks were the devil and this is what happened and I've already got my militant bent on--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but now I'm riding with Ernie Banks and I see these white folks' faces and they're smiling and they profiling, like shaking their hands at me and I didn't know what was going on. I didn't know that a ballplayer was famous 'cause this is my first time going to the ballpark. And so when we pulled up, Gregory Adam's father slid into the seat 'cause there were, the car was mobbed by nothing but a sea of white folks, hollering Ernie's name, "Ernie, Ernie, Ernie, we're going to play two today." "Sign this ball, do this," and this was something now, you got to know that my only experience with what I thought, I thought white folks were the people who killed Emmett Till. So now I'm seeing these white folks on this other thing and so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Adulation for a black player.
Speaker 1: Yes, and so we go, we go, get out the car and we sit in the players' families' box seats, 'cause we get a chance to go in there so everybody is hollering at us and saying, "You, you're Ernie's cousins, and who are you, who are you?" And I'm like just trying to speak and found out that I couldn't even speak. I was frightened so much of being in that atmosphere at ten years old that when I was trying to speak, I couldn't speak. And the place that I was, it was ironic where I sat. This was at ten years old.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And there was a young girl sitting, white girl, sitting on one side and there was this man sitting on the other side. I found out later that was Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald's corporation.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And we had, a kind of a relationship 'cause I'd see him at the game and he told me that I eat McDonald's hamburgers and that he was this and that and all that, um-hm, didn't mean nothing to me. And so, it was quite an experience that I had to overcome. I had to overcome that people, if they liked you, if they liked the sport, they could care less if you was black, white or whatever. If you're going to hit two homeruns, they would cheer you and roll after you and, and all that so, then the next dichotomy I guess that happened was after I had overcome that, a little bit later as a teenager--
Story_ID: 442165
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about the neighborhood you were growing up in.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You're about five years old and obviously in an upscale black neighborhood--
Speaker 2: Well when I was five years old, I remember exactly where I lived, it's 2953 Burnham [Avenue], on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in a, in a white brick stone kind of building.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was a regular neighborhood and it was where you could sit out on the, in Chicago they had those stone fronts where they had the steps you can go up and you can sit down on the side--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and you, and you saw people and they spoke to each other, they knew you and, and sometime when the family had to go someplace, they would watch me and sometimes the kids growing up, they would watch, we would watch their kids and it was just that type of neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Okay, but it was a mixed neighborhood or an all-black (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it was a black, it was all neighbor--
Speaker 1: An all-black neighborhood--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but upscale?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was preachers and postmen and people of that nature that lived in the area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then we moved to further south after they decided to tear down that community and they built a thing called, Lake Meadows [Lake Meadows Apartments, Chicago, Illinois] on 22nd [sic.] and at the time Cottage Grove [sic. South Parkway], is now King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive]. So what they did was they tore that down and so we moved further south and, and when we moved further south, we moved to 82nd [Street] and Burnham and [HistoryMaker] Ernie Banks lived on 81st [Street] and Rhodes [Avenue] and, and so got a chance to meet people like [HistoryMaker] Billy Williams, who moved in the area. When you had segregation, the ballplayers tend to move close to other ballplayers. So Billy Williams (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, 'cause they're limit--their residences are limited.
Speaker 2: --their residences are limited.
Speaker 1: You're limited to where they live, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 442166
Speaker 1: I wanted to get into a little before we leave to get to--you get to be ten years old, I wanted to get the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --sights and sounds of you in school, what school that was you went to, elementary.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And some of the sights and sounds and teachers that you remember at--
Speaker 2: Okay, well, well, I remember at, at five, six years old, I went to a grammar school named Harvard Elementary School [Harvard School of Excellence] in Chicago [Illinois] and Harvard was not, being five, six years old, it was, it was, to me, vanilla, I didn't, I don't remember, you know, I know I think I passed (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: That's all I could remember.
Speaker 1: And your grades were better than most, I imagine?
Speaker 2: Well, I was, I was more someone who knew how to draw what I was thinking and I, I would put a caption underneath it. So, so they said that I was either dumb or special because I would read the back of the book and I would write things that they said that the assignments gonna be but I would already have it, already written.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so they were saying that maybe he needs to move over here and maybe he needs to do this and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I, I felt I was never challenged in, in grammar school but after six years old, my dad [Frederick McDonald, Sr.] made a decision. He told me that he did not want to get arrested but he still needed me to go to school. So, he let my brothers and sisters, especially my sister, Margie [Marjorie McDonald], she did most of my homework. And so it was kind of like, he didn't want me to read those books. He had special books for me to read. So I had, so I had to gain a memory 'cause my sister would do my homework so, and then I had to learn how to write like my sister so it was, it was kind of fun in a sense because I didn't have to do any homework ever in grammar school or in high school [Hirsch High School; Emil G. Hirsch Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois]. My sister, or somebody did my homework for me and my job was to memorize it 'cause my father felt that the education that the public school was giving us was going to set us back the next hundred years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, it became something that I found to be true. I see what happened, I, he, he brought me into what I call the intelligence of the country, the intelligence of government, the intelligence of what was going on that we didn't know about. So he wanted me to understand government. So he made, we went to the library quite often and we studied government. We studied every inch of government and he said, if it's corrupt, he said, it corrupts the people. So if you have a government or a school system that is corrupt, then you can tell by the people who surround that school.
Story_ID: 442167
Speaker 1: Now let me get into the neighborhood, some of your friends there in the neighborhood. Things were changing fast there in Chicago [Illinois] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Neighborhoods were being broken down, blacks were able to move to other places?
Speaker 2: Right, that was after '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and we're in that period '65 [1965] to '70 [1970].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: How, how, did you notice the neighborhood changing and maybe you noticed it through the church and so forth--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: What church did you go to during that period?
Speaker 2: Well, I pretty much stayed with my father going to every church--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause he's an evangelist and sometime we wound up in white churches because they would, 'cause he was also a special police officer at the time. And so when I was growing up, he was one that called himself Reverend Frederick Douglas McDonald [Frederick McDonald, Sr.] and he, he also was a special police officer, in fact, a first sergeant of a special police unit in Chicago. He was the first black sergeant.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, it was quite, and he did a lot of work with the Daily Defender [Chicago Daily Defender; Chicago Defender] and we would go and pick up information and bring it back to the Daily Defender, when, what was going on in different places.
Speaker 1: Do you remember who the editor or some of the writers were?
Speaker 2: Well, the head man himself, Siegel, Segal [sic. Robert Sengstacke Abbott], I can't think of his name right now, but he was the founder of the Defender and the one who actually founded the Bud Billiken Parade [Bud Billiken Parade and Picnic] and at the Daily Defender well, my father was one of his, his, if you want to call it think tank. My father was a member of the think tank of the Daily Defender when I was growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, he would, he would, we would go and pick up, I think the most challenging time I could remember that was different for me is when we were driving, he always had a big, big car and we were driving and he was pulled over by the police officer and the police officer came up to him, and he's always dressed in a suit and tie, and the police officer came up to him and said, "Boy," and I was, I never heard nobody call my father boy. He made my friends, he made everyone, he was Reverend Frederick Douglas McDonald and nobody called him Freddie except for his immediate friends and family but if he was out in the street, I would have to introduce him as Reverend Frederick Douglas McDonald and that was him. He, he was a proud man and if anybody called him anything else, so when we were stopped by the police officer, the police officer came up and then hit his car with his hand and said, "Boy," says, "what you doing with a car like this?" Well, my father had a gun to his head and, and he had him on the ground. I know he got out of the car so quick and there's a word called, peckerwood that he used and he, and he told him that he was a minister and that he would blow his head off and I'm looking out the window and I didn't know my father had a gun and he pulled out his badge, he took all the information and he, he really was upset and I think that he followed through on it and I think he even, they made him a special police officer that went to educate white people on being a human being when you're dealing with people.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So he was one of the first ones that had, was part of a unit to teach white people how to respect other people.
Story_ID: 442168
Speaker 1: And so going to various churches, one of the things I remember being, him being an evangelist, was him bringing maybe twenty white people from where he worked at, 'cause he worked downtown Chicago [Illinois] in the courthouse and I think this was the first time that this, it was a dirt church. It seemed like it had a dirt floor and it was nothing but black people in the church and here come twenty white people. They had never, had any kind of service with white folks before and when, when those white folks came in and sat down, I think the black folks, for the first time thought that they was back in slavery 'cause they was all trying to get over and sitting on, almost sitting on top of each other so that these white folks, they was like, what is going on with this? So my father [Frederick McDonald, Sr.] had a church sermon, I can't remember the minister that invited him to come in to speak, but he had white people get up and he had them talk about their trials and tribulations that they have as a people that, that they are, they have, they sin and, and they do things that is, that's not legal.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so he wanted black people to understand that these were people and that we all had to reach for a higher plane. And so he would do things like that. He would invite, to your church, he might come to your church and be twenty, twenty Asians that would be with him and he would find a seat for them because they came in town 'cause he was a special police officer and like the Asians, or something. So one time, I'm with him and he picks up Walt Disney. Now I didn't know who Walt Disney was but Walt Disney, because my father was a special police officer that would, would pick up certain details and things, he became friends with a lot of so-called people of importance. And so when Walt Disney came into town, this is like 1956, '57 [1957], '58 [1958], and he took me to this, I believe Walt Disney went to Marshall High School [John Marshall Metropolitan High School] in Chicago, or some--we went to a high school, and I got a chance to spend the day with Walt Disney and he was telling me about his dreams. He wanted to buy a place called Riverview [Riverview Park]. Riverview was an amusement park in Chicago and he would tell me about what he was trying to do, that he was a filmmaker and that he, he liked to draw cartoons, did I like to doodle cartoons and things of that nature. And so, the greatest thrill that I had was about ten years ago, I spoke at Walt Disney World [Walt Disney World Resort, Orlando, Florida] with corporations and I talked to them about the fact that I had met Walt Disney and that, and that to be here is something that I think my father would be proud of that he, his whole thing in life was to show me or to introduce me to people that were trying to do something for other people. And so, I met Walt Disney in my young life. I met Ray Kroc, and so things like that.
Speaker 2: Okay, did at any time you become knowledgeable about Walt Disney's history of racism in this country and the discrimination that he had against black people?
Speaker 1: Well, well, I'll put it this way. I only met him that one day.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so other than that, the only thing that I saw was someone who was interested in amusement parks and things of that nature. So, so his history, I can imagine because there's so many people now who are, who are in judgeships and, and in high places who'd trade their white robes into for blue suits. So, you can't, sometimes you can't tell the player without a scorecard.
Story_ID: 442169
Speaker 1: Okay, let's look at your junior high school. What, what junior high did you go to and--
Speaker 2: Well, well I went to, I went to, at the time, Dixon Elementary [Arthur Dixon Elementary School] in Chicago [Illinois] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --and then I went to Hirsch High School [Emil G. Hirsch Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --where I played sports and, but, but again, it was more like I was planning a life, I was planning two lives. I went to school but I did not study at school. My father [Frederick McDonald, Sr.] and I, at the time, my father was retired and at the time my father and I decided that it was time for us to identify an institution that we needed to build and he felt like that institution was a college [Common Communications Commission]. So, so he made sure that I studied infrastructure of Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], places that he felt that we should emulate as our own college because he felt that the public school system was, was allowing us to be second class citizens for the future. He said that the children of the future, people who are my age now, who were young then, were, were unqualified to run the future.  That was his thought.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He, he did not think of Bush [President George Walker Bush], he didn't know a Bush existed but he would tell me now, if he came into existence now, I told you, that boy is not qualified to be president. And he would give me all the reasons why he's not qualified.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He would go to a school like USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California], and he'd say, this must be some dumb people that, that go to USC. How can such a wealthy institution, he'd say, you know an institution by the decadence that surrounds it. If it's a good institution, decadence doesn't surround it but if it's a bad institution, they absorb all the wealth and all the goodness of what life can give--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and outside its doors it does not translate to those people. So, I found that to be true that if you look at all the institutions and universities and other things that are in our midst today, that they have presided over poverty for the last hundred years or so, fearfulness. They have, they have said that they are educated but they can't educate people. They've created wealth for themselves and poverty for the rank and file and then they pull sometimes talented black folks into their midst. And so you have rich black folks who work for a living but do not own institutions or businesses and so you have a bad problem in this country and that problem is that there is no future for the rank and file. So we did not follow the teachings even if we look at Rockefeller [John D. Rockefeller] or whoever. What we've done is we've accepted the little wealth that we get for our own personal selves and we shut the door on creating jobs through growing businesses. So if you look at the number of businesses that we don't have, and you'll see that the future is very bleak because of the education system that taught us, get a good job, get a good education, and then we go out to get a good job and education, where's the job? If we don't create jobs, who's going to give us the job? So, these were the kind of sessions that I used to have with my father and his associates about the future. So, you know, when I was fourteen, I spent two weeks with about fifteen black men who were over ninety, and I was about fourteen, and we talked about the future and one of the things that we talked about was institution building.
Story_ID: 440818
Speaker 1: We are at a place where you're learning a lot of things. Your father [Frederick McDonald, Sr.] has certain ideas about your education and he wanted to, you're at the Hirsch School, right?
Speaker 2: Hirsch High School [Emil G. Hirsch Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Hirsch High--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But he was interested in your going on to a higher education?
Speaker 2: Well, he was interested in, in us creating our own institution, called a college.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He wasn't, he didn't believe that we were getting a fair shake in terms of what the future had in store for us and he thought that the Civil Rights Movement was, it should be more of us collaborating our money in opening up the store and if they burn it down, we need to have our shotguns ready. He did not think that we should be going into five and ten cent stores, that was just his opinion--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --because he felt like they were stealing the food and things like that but if we were a people who got, had pride in ourselves and open up our own restaurant, that eventually that was the ticket to our survival and to our thriving. And so, that was his thought process.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and sometimes he had to drive an enemy that, why don't we think about opening up our own college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and so what would that look like? And so, from sixteen to eighteen, we drew up the various courses that we would teach in college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so that college was named (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) From your sixteen years of age--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --through the year eighteen?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: So we named the college, Common Communications Commission, CCC, and, and so from there we, we invented a concept called the science of seeing, S-E-E-I-N-G, and he said, we have to see behind the scenes. So, my college days of creating the college was to go to the libraries or to historical aspects of who were the men who created Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]? Who was the men who created college and what was their aim? What was the purpose of them creating college? And so, it all came down to self-wealth. College was not intended for us to learn anything other than how to take care of the farm that we all own. So, so, so, how do you do that? How do you create, for yourself, in a system if nobody else was around? So, he learned from my grandfather that, that if you were part of those individuals who were the ones who were the masterminds to create five hundred communities, that would systematically destroy, we hear the names Rosewood [Florida] and, and Black Wall Street [Greenwood, Tulsa, Oklahoma] and that type of thing but very seldom do you understand that those communities was destroyed.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so if they were dest- weren't destroyed, then who would we be today? We would have passed it on to the next generation. We have no history of a succession plan. We have no history of us passing on what we've accumulated in this life to the next generation. So, so, it's, it's, it's very difficult to not agree with him now.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So he told me thirty years--from pretty much before he died, that it would maybe be thirty years before I would even understand what change was.
Story_ID: 440819
Speaker 1: You graduated from high school when you were sixteen?
Speaker 2: No, I graduated from high school in 1967--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and I was eighteen but, but I basically was almost a non-attendant in public high school, just enough so that I could pass.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What we did was we did the research during the time when I should have been going to school. We did the research on what it would look like to own a college.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What, what, so he would put money in my hands so that it was a fund searching in terms of building our own school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you attended Hirsch [Hirsch High School; Emil G. Hirsch Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --High enough to, to pass--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but during that same period, you were researching what it would be like to own and operate your own college?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, did there come a time when you did have, yourself and other students, attending that school [Common Communications Commission]?
Speaker 2: It, well, being the vice president, it was, it was pretty much me being a student, my father [Frederick McDonald, Sr.] being a teacher and a student and inviting others to see what we're doing but we never formalized it so that we had students. We, what we did was, it was so exciting to some people that they wanted to hang out, they wanted to be around because we would go to the library and break down different things and one of the assignments was to go to IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] and, and to create a deal with IBM as a college. And we, there was a typewriter place that we connected with an IBM and created a deal for this one company to repair typewriters for IBM and created a contract for a typewriter company. And so, I think that that was the start of me becoming what I consider to be a dealmaker--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because I would see a need here and I'd see somebody over here that could fulfill that need and I would put the two together and then I would say, I want 5 percent and I, and they would give me money because I put these two deals together and that was exciting.
Story_ID: 440820
Speaker 1: So I, I became a promoter in, in the music industry when I was like fourteen and that's when I met Mr. Eddie Thomas, a HistoryMaker, and he was like somebody that I watched who founded Curtom Records with Curtis Mayfield and he had a studio, he had an institution. And so we would go into his institution and we worked with Leroy Hutson, who was part of his institution and it was powerful to create a product, see, see writers and see producers and see musicians, see singers, coming together to pull together a product and then to hear it on the radio as a finished product was a very exciting childhood in terms of starting as an entrepreneur as a young age in the music industry. So, it was, it was great. Got a chance to meet people like James Brown and, and people like that and do jingles with them and, and, and working behind the scenes and watching Eddie Thomas work behind the scenes at Curtom Records and how many people that he launched, millionaires that he launched in his career.
Speaker 2: Okay, though, so the institution became, at first, a part of the record promotion business, am I correct (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, when it, it first became, what does an institution looks like? What does an institution look like? How come people who have institutions solve the problem of community 'cause in our society, maybe the institution in our, in our life today is the church but outside the church, the only other institution that we really know about, besides education, is jail.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So we don't own the institution called, the bank, as a community. I'm not talking about there's a few people say you got a little ownership or something. I'm talking about in Davis, California, is one of our examples. They own the cable station, they own the grocery store. If you look at television, you see orange juice companies where they say they own the land, own the trees. So I studied Sunkist [Sunkist Growers, Inc.]. When I studied Sunkist, I saw sixty-five hundred farmers owning the company called, Sunkist. I saw Sunkist being an incubator or a corporation or an institution and I saw sixty-five hundred self-employee farmers who pooled their limited resources in terms of the ownership, the member ownership of Sunkist and when you see the cooperative industry and back in the day when I started studying it through, through the, through the college we set up [Common Communications Commission]. Cooperative, I saw that it was an interchangeable word that some government officials, when people tried to cooperate that way, they called it communism. So, sometimes when you said cooperation, they mis- they misread what you said and thought you said communism. There's a big difference in a cooperative and communism.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: One is a belief and the other is a methodology. So, I, I found that to be a subject matter that allowed me to travel to school to school and to, to be a spokesperson for why cooperation is different than communism. And so, I, I showcase different cooperatives around the world that was successful for its, for its community and that I thought that the black African American community should think about operating as a cooperative. So, so I put that into my hopper, so to speak, and, and that is one of the, the, what I call, pieces of the puzzle that I think that would change the future if we model and simulate it today.
Story_ID: 440821
Speaker 1: What I wanted to try to illustrate was the model that you talked about on the record promotions side (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --and then the model that you talked about similar to the Sunkist [Sunkist Growers, Inc.]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --people.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Have you set up something, a model, on any of those two?
Speaker 2: Many times.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Many times.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things, one of our future history makers is Phil Brown. He's the executive director of our organization [Global Business Incubation, Inc.]. I met him twenty years ago and we've been studying methodologies. Before I met Phil, we worked with San Diego State Foundation [San Diego State University Research Foundation, San Diego, California]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and what we tried to do was try to put out there that what would happen if five hundred young people operated under one umbrella with a hundred instructors and that became a school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well we, we submitted that information to a group of people, bankers, all kind of people. We, we, we used the San Diego Chamber of Commerce [San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce]. We did stories, we did videos and this was in 1988 and what we found is that everybody thought, well, we're going to break the ceiling. You know, that was during a period of time when black executives were getting their first jobs and they were beating on their chests, they thought it was going to stay that way but somehow we knew, I guess being a futurist, that if we didn't take that opportunity to pull our act together and become a cooperative business community and create incubators, business incubators as a model, I, I, we thought that, you know what's going to happen is that we don't see uncertainty. We don't see the future. We don't see how to because we can't see into the future but if you look at the past, you will see that the future is wrapped up into the steps you took yesterday, it's going to come together to the steps you take tomorrow. So you're going to have to see if you can change between the steps you took yesterday and see if you can create a change so you could, you have to become a change agent.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And if you become a change agent, we found that you have to draw pictures, that you have to create scenarios, scenario planning and so we have been experimenting.
Story_ID: 440822
Speaker 1: We [Global Business Incubation, Inc.] worked with Dr. George Kozmetsky, who, who was one of the co-founders of Teledyne [Teledyne Technologies, Inc.] and IC Square [IC2 Institute] in Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], and he was able to pull 139 companies under one umbrella called Teledyne. And so we worked with him for about a decade. One of the things that he did, he pulled two hundred North American corporations together and that was called the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences [Ann Arbor, Michigan] where we participated in their think tank and, and some of the events that they created. So, we had a plan. We have a plan based on Sunkist [Sunkist Growers, Inc.]. We have a plan based on thirty-five years of trial and error and we, and we've been able to survive pretty much in a middle class function by using institutions like Loyola Marymount University [Los Angeles, California] and, and when we're in San Diego [California], San Diego State University. So we were able to see what it looked like, how an institution's supposed to look and we were able to create that type of mental model and now we're creating a physical model because we believe that now, with the use of reality type of shows, that we can show smart, young people, who have plenty of talent, what happens if we teach them to model and simulate a blueprint, a business plan, not, not a business plan on paper but a living business plan. And we invite corporate sponsors to come, come and see what two hundred small businesses look like that, that also had a thousand apprentice and that collectively, those who were the smartest would be the leaders and those who didn't catch on would be the grips and that we collectively would create wealth by buying businesses and then showcase those young people learning how to do all the functions in running that business. And so we believe that if we show enough of that, that we might be able to create at least in a scenario film, and a business game, the use of each other and each other's talents, under one umbrella in a value chain. And so, that's what we've been working on in just, just very diligently over the last four years is, is the model. And so it was really a pleasure because basically, I'm a behind the scenes man so, so unsung, I guess, [HistoryMaker] Eddie Thomas thought that I was an unsung person because of the work that we're doing and Lou Myers [HistoryMaker Lewis Myers] is, is someone who is well-known in the entertainment industry, being in the, the TV show, 'A Different World'--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --'The Fighting Temptations,' 'The Wedding Planner,' being on theatre, being in basically all the functions in the entertainment business that he's been in and we've been conversing for, at least eleven years, and, and basically, we said, you know what, we're going to have to create a movie and a game to show how we should be, not how we are, because we have to move fast into the future, paint the future, make ourselves be owners of banks, insurance companies and, and all the other small type companies so that in the future, we can, we can paint our own picture--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and present it today.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And so, so that's, that's what our, our work is all about.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay. A working model of this will be available publicly--
Speaker 1: Well, first--
Speaker 2: --sometime in the near future?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes. In fact, one of the things that we have done is we've found some, what I call headlights, people who are doing the kind of work that needs to be done that we have met. And so we've created a show, or, or pretty much I consider it a communications vehicle, what we call the 'On the Air Show' [ph.] in search of community wealth creators and in that kind of capacity, we believe that we can cast and, and follow up on and use as consultants, professionals in business, professionals in sports, professionals in, in theatre and, and put together the kind of scenarios that allow us to see how we look in the future if we were responsible for business ownership in our community.
Story_ID: 440823
Speaker 1: The plan that you have, have in mind, you're going to be moving from city to city or is most of it going to be done right here in Los Angeles [California]?
Speaker 2: Well, the, we're [Global Business Incubation, Inc.] building a prototype here--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but we also are in New York [New York]. We're pulling together a, a, teams of people in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Also, we're in Bermuda and we expect that once this prototype's in place, we want to open up in fifty plus locations like a Starbucks [Starbucks Corporation]. Having, having met, met Ray Kroc, it, it gave me the opportunity to understand that Ray Kroc really didn't sell hamburgers, he sold real estate and he sold it to individuals who wanted to become part of a system and share in the cost of the advertising, share in the cost but as a community of McDonald's, whether you're in Chicago or down the street, it almost looks the same and the meats and the, and all the sandwiches taste the same. And so, wherever you go, that's what we believe has to happen in our prototype and the prototype should be in fifty plus locations because if we don't create an infrastructure, see, there's people who are wealthy and they close the door. What happens to their money when they pass away? So we, we don't pass on Motown [Motown Records]. We don't pass on the, the Black Entertainment TV [Black Entertainment Television]. We tended to sell those things instead of passing it on. I, I can't imagine Rockefeller [John D. Rockefeller] selling Rockefeller [sic. Standard Oil Company]. I, I can't imagine Ford [Henry Ford] selling Ford [Ford Motor Company]. I think Ford passes on their, their Ford name to the next generation. I, I think the Hilton girls [Paris Hilton and Nicky Hilton Rothschild], I don't think they run the Hilton corporations [Hilton Worldwide] but I think they still benefit from Hilton and I think that unless we make a movie and a game about us, the ownership of institutions that we can pass on to the next generation, we're fooling ourselves in behalf of the next generation because I believe every other nationality who comes into this country create a little Italy, they create little Tokyo. Wherever you go, you see their community, as a community. If you go to Wilshire [Mid-Wilshire] here in Los Angeles [California], you can't read unless you are from the, the Asian persuasion. You can't read their windows and you're American. So, what happens to Americans if we don't build institutions that allow us to own our future? And so, if we can't do it in real time, we're going to make movies and games that, that showcase, what if we own our past, that means the institutions of five hundred communities so what we, so Lou Myers [HistoryMaker Lewis Myers] in, in New York, with his footsteps from before, is operating from the past and what we're doing here is operating in the future and then we're going to showcase what happens when the past and the future intelligence come together.
Story_ID: 440824
Speaker 1: Will your model work for all cultural groups? You know, it's been successful for whites, as you've indicated--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and (unclear). It's being proven that it can be successful for African Americans?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Will it work for Asian Pacific cultures?
Speaker 2: It already works for them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And what we have to do as black Americans, especially black Americans who have a history from slavery to today, is understand that we're being systemically eliminated. You look at CNN, or you look at any program, you might see us but we speak another language, we come from another place and you might see Asians. You see Oprah Winfrey and then you, you hear about the superstar that she is but it seems to me, doing my research, that that is genocide when you give one person all the money and a million die.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, if, if during the period of time when she became a television personality, I think other young black ladies were going out for journalism and they thought the door was open. Well you turn on the television today, you might see an Asian. You might see someone else but you very seldom see a journalist, who went to school, be on television that looked like us. And so, you have a lot of frustrated people because we kept thinking that, okay, it's our turn and then you look at the world today, every other persuasion have come into our community and have claimed minority citizenship.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so I think that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And profited by it.
Speaker 2: --and profited on the work of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], profited from the work of all of those civil rights people and yet the people who we had to overcome, never told those immigrants that came to this country what black Americans have done. So there's a disrespect in, in Asian America for black Americans. There's a disrespect in Latin and, and Latino and Mexicans coming over to this country, so much so that some have threatened the lives of black people and don't know the history that if not for the Civil Rights Movement, they would not be here.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they certainly would not be shacked up in white communities. So, so they sent them to Compton [California], they sent them to Lynwood [California] and other locations and in Chicago [Illinois] and other places and gave them minority rights whereas in the, in the '40s [1940s] and the '50s [1950s] or the '60s [1960s], fifty- '60s [1960s], when, when the welfare, after, there was no jobs for the community, they separated the family with welfare. There were men who had to hide in closets and other places and yet when, when other races of people came over with the same problem, they kept the family together. So, it has been a struggle for at least 150 years of keeping a family together if you were an African American black family that, that was a part of or descendants of slavery.
Story_ID: 440825
Speaker 1: The next steps for your group [Global Business Incubation, Inc.] then, on following these HistoryMaker [The HistoryMakers] interviews is, is what?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the reasons why we invited the people who you probably met and, and one of the people we'd like to thank is Pastor Beverly Allen, who allowed us to come and use this beautiful facility [Faithful Central Bible Church, Inglewood, California]. The reason why I said that I think I see her in my vision, but, but I want to thank her personally and I, for our group, because you, you know, this, this church is not like most churches that you see, they own the Forum [Inglewood, California].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They, they own where the Lakers [Los Angeles Lakers] used to play.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so they own the Forum. And so we, we're always in search of community wealth creators and so Pastor Beverly Allen, who, who has been so gracious and, and who was a history maker also--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because she works with young people and, and she's pretty much the person that is called on when somebody's in need. Her phone rings constantly 'cause when you, when you operate a big institution like this church, you got a lot of people in need and she, she knows how to deal with the rank and file and that's a very hard thing to do.
Story_ID: 442456
Speaker 1: I was asking you about Pastor Beverly Allen--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And let's go ahead and give us some background on her--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and her role.
Speaker 2: Okay. Well our executive director [at Global Business Incubation, Inc.], Phil Brown, met her probably last summer--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and told her what was in our heart, what we were attempting to do was to create this model of what it'd look like when we own our institutions. Well, sometimes you have to be lucky and find someone who agrees with what your vision is.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: And so she has been one of those people who have come to where we are. We haven't necessarily had to come to where she is to see what we were talking about. And so when HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] said that I was an unsung hero, saw me in the, what I called in the basement trying to dust off some books, you know, I couldn't think of where to have it at and, and then I thought about it. Well, what, what other place that has an institution like the Forum [Inglewood, California] that looked like us, that has the ability to create wealth, the ability to inspire others. You see, if you pass by the Forum, you'll be in from Washington, D.C. coming in from, from the airport [Los Angeles International Airport, Los Angeles, California], when you, when you're driving down where the Forum is, where the Lakers [Los Angeles Lakers] used to play, there's a big marquee out there and sometimes you'll be stopped at the light and you want to see what the next thing is going on and you hear somebody blowing in the background of you (laughter) 'cause--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --giving you all the, it's a, it's very progressive and, and what we like to do is, we like to demonstrate and create the prototype and partnership with what Pastor Beverly Allen brings and, and that brings, what I call the intelligence of someone who cares about others.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And so, so we are happy that we were able to do that here. You know, we talked about LMU [Loyola Marymount University, Los Angeles, California], we talked about several other places--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but, you know, sometimes God works in mysterious ways. We had to do it here because I believe that Pastor Beverly Allen and, and Bishop Ulmer [Kenneth C. Ulmer], I, I, I think that they are working in a history making kind of platform and I think that it needs to be highlighted 'cause I think that your organization is so necessary and after reading up on you guys and, and I've been reading up on you since I've known [HistoryMaker] Eddie Thomas--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, my second time around because I knew him when I was a young man and so I got reacquainted with him a, a few years ago and he actually works as our vice chairman because what we, are very excited about is going back into the past of Eddie Thomas because he was an institution builder back in the day, he founding Curtis Mayfield, the, The Impressions and all the things that he did, all the, all the people that I believe he or him being a wealth creator.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, so, I think it takes one to know one and so I think what we're bringing together are history makers and I think that we're history makers because we're going to build institutions that support young men and women who have no future or hope for future and we're talking about a real, high-paying jobs. We're talking about real businesses and, and if we don't first model and simulate what's the narrow plan, how're we going to do this. The past will look like the future and the future really doesn't exist when it comes because it become the present and then once it becomes the present, it's the past.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So we have to run so far into the future 'cause we know that as soon as it come, it's the present and soon as that day is over, we look back and say, wow, that was a good day or bad day (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 2: So, I'm constantly running towards the year 2020.
Story_ID: 442457
Speaker 1: I don't want to age to the year 2020 yet but I, I go there because very few people are there right now. And so what we're [Global Business Incubation, Inc.] doing in the year 2020, is we're preparing our own e-banking system, our own insurance system. We're, we have to raise funds for ourselves and for our community and then we, as a community, as a black community, should invite every race to be a part of our community. I think we integrated with our institution building. So if we go back with Lou Myers [HistoryMaker Lewis Myers] to 1888, when segregation was the way of the land, we naturally build banks in 1888. We naturally understood that we had to own our own insurance companies and I think when we moved into the future too fast in terms of integration, we gave up our hotels, we gave up our, our economy and, and I think that if we don't go back so that we can reclaim our own ownership of us, the clothes on our back, the hair care products that we make, if we don't reclaim that, we will not get a, what we call a discount from those who got these industries because all we have to do is look at the present and the past and we see they haven't returned on the investment that we make in the businesses in our community. So, if they don't make a return on the investment on the dollars we spent now with, we've spent billions with everyone--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) but ourselves and they don't give us a return on investment, they take our money in those Brink trucks and they take it someplace else and then when we try to get a business loan, they'll give us a car loan, they now give us housing loans and things to own some houses, but the reason why I know Phil Brown is a history maker, our executive director, is because he recognized that if you don't create business incubators, even if the rent is almost free, you still can't pay the rent.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, that's, that's, that's our theory in terms of model making and simulating what we need to do in order to survive and thrive into the future.
Story_ID: 442458
Speaker 1: I'm going back to some examples (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --so that you can make your model--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --paradigm of, comparable to a little bit different age so that our readers and listeners--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --could understand it better.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: If you had embarked on this back in the days of Madam C.J. Walker--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --let's, let's go there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: How, how would your plan, say that she had bought into that, how, how would it have been different for us?
Speaker 2: I, I, I think that it would be without the electrical aspect that we have today. I think we were more cooperative then because we had to be. I, I think that my plan is based on 1888 thinking and 21st century tools. So if we, if we go back, that's the foundation. See, if you go back to Rockefeller [John D. Rockefeller], and then we was to bomb Rockefeller Square [sic. Rockefeller Center, New York, New York] in 1902, 1903, he'd be sitting in my seat talking about, "Man, we used to have institutions and things like that. Remember we used to have that institution called, a bank," and, and we'd be trying to figure it out. He says, what happened? How come we don't own any institutions anymore? Well, we were given, what I call, the red pill. If you saw 'The Matrix' and all that good stuff, and we were told that, get a good education and you can get a good job over the last forty, fifty years, I, I think there was a game plan after the Civil Rights Movement and that was that that black folks are gaining on us. And so that puts some other people in the mix. So, let's throw, let's throw the Mexicans in the mix. Let's throw the Asians in the mix and let them fight so that we in control can now be in more control.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so during that period of time, I am lucky because my wife, Tonia McDonald, who is the president of Global Business Incubation [Global Business Incubation, Inc.], we were able to raise enough money so that we could stay on the course of being the observer--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause sometimes when you work nine to five [o'clock], you, you, the fumes of driving back and forth, you're tired, you go to bed, you wake up in the morning, you look at the news, maybe a minute of the news but you don't get a chance to study the environment that you're living in. So in the '80s [1980s], I saw Bill Gates coming. I got a chance to see Bill Gates and I got a chance to see him and I got a chance to read Forbes Magazine and study how Bill Gates was creating a new economy in the 1980s. So Tonia and I, Tonia McDonald, we were at San Diego State University [San Diego, California], we were working with the San Diego- the foundation [San Diego State University Research Foundation, San Diego, California] and the, and the Minority Business Development Center and we saw something very amazing. We saw an economy coming in the '80s [1980s] that we were headed up. We headed up that economy, it was called incubation but when, when we were working with San Diego State Foundation and the Minority Business Development Center, they took all our information, said, oh man, the incubator's a wonderful thing, we had letters up and down the West Coast, wow, what a great idea, what a great idea. And they asked us something very unusual and various institutions and I remember it 'cause we had about thirty letters from institutions in Oceanside [California] and other places and they all told us that we don't have that many black people, can, can this be for everybody? Yeah, it sure can but we're, we're black and we're from Chicago [Illinois] and we know that our community need this and that and that. So they say, yeah, okay. So they wrote us these great letters. Somehow they systematically cut us out of our own plan and--
Speaker 1: And that can happen.
Speaker 2: And all the time if you don't have a community behind you--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and, and when you don't have a community behind you, they'll pat you on the back and say, give me some more of that information, give me some more of that information. So we gave them so much information that we think that we helped create or identify an economy that is still going strong in San Diego [California] and then to make it even worse, we were invited to come to NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], in Pasadena [California] and they knew all about us because we were planning on creating incubator and, and, and NASA took an interest in our work and they showed us, one of the scientist showed us a book of all our work, that they had crossed out our name in black. That's how, how we know that San Diego used a lot of our work and I said on camera--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --that San Diego took a lot of GBI [Global Business Incubation, Inc.], CSBD's [Creative Systems Business Development, Inc.] work and never paid us a penny for it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I hope one of 'em see it (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What--
Story_ID: 442459
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask another question following this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay. Okay.
Speaker 1: --but first I want to ask you about a person that I knew working down there at that time on this, Harold Brown [Harold K. Brown].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And how did Harold intermix and, why that it not work with him and your organization [Global Business Incubation, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll put it like this. There's some water that they gave us that allowed us to be who we are but still it was about me, even though Harold Brown, a very brilliant man, great idea but that was his idea and this was my idea. And so, what I found after years and years of trial and error is that if we don't create a model or simulate how we all can work together, then we're going to continue to be like a house full of unplugged appliances. We can look good but the infrastructure does not, is not the grid for all of our ideas. So we have to sneak a highway under the Harold Brown's because he's doing great work. He did great work but we live in a society where if we don't have a fan base of 100,000 to 4 million, 5 million people, we in trouble.
Speaker 1: Right, I agree (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And so, I'll give you an example. With all the fast food companies that have come into existence over the last thirty years, Burger King said something quite interesting. Burger King says, that let us keep 4 million customer base and we, we can live with that and everybody else come that's great. Well, we have to ask ourselves, if we created a system, would we have a 4 million people customer base and if we created a 4 million customer base, then we could challenge Corporate America and others to invest in a group of people who are operating in, in a collective--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but if we operate as individuals, it's like when I was selling advertising for my brother's magazine when I was growing up, we went to an advertising agency, I did, I was the advertising representative and they told me that they already gave their dollars to Ebony and Jet and my brother had a fledging young magazine and so I told them there was no way that we could eat off of what you give Ebony and Jet. Do you operate your companies in that manner? Where one company comes in, you tell the next company come in, say, well, we gave to them so you go to them and, and we had that quite often when one successful entity is given money to, they, they tell you to go see them 'cause we gave the money to them. They don't see you as a prolific company on the rise. And so if we don't create that infrastructure that's so necessary, that's so necessary for HistoryMakers, we need to create large museums that house The HistoryMakers as an institution and that's one of my goals is that any institution that we create should be member owned by millions of people, millions of people because if we don't own the infrastructure, see we can own our own business--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but we should also own the union. See, when, 'cause, 'cause if you do a movie or a game or something, and you don't use somebody's union, they, they, they look very, frown on you very definitely. So if we create our own union, where we pay dues to the infrastructure, so it's just like owning a car. If we all own individual cars, then it should seem like we should maybe own the highway. So, so if we own our own business, it should seem common sense to own our own incubator and so we're incubator experts and we know that incubators could be called NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration]. We know that incubators are institutions that are owned by the rank and file. So we ask ourselves, how many of us own incubators in our community? Is there a healthcare incubator in our community? Nope, but what should it be? Kaiser Permanente is an incubator but is it owned by our community? So, so we're saying, how can we own an incubator and own our own individual businesses?
Story_ID: 442460
Speaker 1: So, if you have a big house and everybody got a room in it that means that you have an office in the incubator. If we all go to the same conference room, it means that we're sharing a conference room. If we're sharing the cost of the, the, the, all the paraphernalia that you need to run a business, that's called shared cost. So if we share the cost of owning real estate, so think of this. We're going to cast a thousand young people, we have two hundred teachers that we're casting, we're going to put those thousand young people on ten teams and just think, hypothetically in a scenario, that us teaching those thousand young people to own a business that the tuition was, and we know how much tuition cost to go to school, private school or public school, it's more than $100 a year but just think of this. That those young people, those 1000 young people in 10 divisions with us being their mentors and partners and teachers, that it cost $100 and I'm saying $100 at the bare bottom. That means that we have a 100,000 a month, pooled, they don't know that $100 with a 1000 people is $100,000 a month. And so we want to showcase how that look, that us as real estate experts, like Phil Brown, Brad Carson, can go out and look at a piece of property and leverage those thousand young people, their tuition, and buy that as a cooperative and then in a reality show, create ownership, showcase some of the young people who are stronger with their hands than with their brain at this point, painting the place. Those who's stronger as accountants, doing the, the purchasing of, of produce, those who are good at serving others, represent, now, a thousand young people owning that business will be educated faster and with more quality education by showcasing what it looked like to own that, that small store as a community than all the education they get right now.
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And that, and that's what we are going to demonstrate.
Story_ID: 442461
Speaker 1: I want to also give you an opportunity to tell us, your wife of thirty-six years--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tonia [Tonia McDonald], and her role in this.
Speaker 2: Well, well, I, I, I want to thank my father, Reverend Frederick Douglas McDonald [Frederick McDonald, Sr.]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --who is in heaven and I know he's in heaven because him and my mother [Josephine Harper McDonald] talk to people and they call us up out of the clear blue sky and say, your mother came to see me, I got some money for you.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So my mother's been passed away in 1984 so sometimes I talk to my father because my father told me, before he was passed away, he said, you know, he said, when you get to be my age, he, he loved to count, and, and so, and if he said that, say I'm 58, in 2 years I'll be 60, so in 1955, when I went to Emmett Till's funeral, my father was 60 and I was 6 and he told me that as the years pass when he's 70, he said, you'll be 12 or 15 or 16, 17 and he said that he was going to be leaving me because there was such a disparity in age but he said I could go at any time, where I run across that street, get hit by a car. He always gave me that option, that I could leave now or I can leave later. And, and one of the things that he, he taught me, was the future. He said, don't be afraid of the future because the tree that you see right here is going to be a tree that's going to be here when you're not here. He said understand what a tree is all about. A tree allows you to sit under the shade but it's going to allow your son to sit under the tree and he's the one that I think talked Tonia into marrying me and I think the reason why was 'cause she was adventurous and he was very plainly and clearly stating that for us to solve the problem of the future, a man needs a good woman, someone who is smart and someone that, not just interested in diamond rings and, and dresses but who also should be a researcher and understand that certain things are going to come to pass and it's going to be devastating for women and especially going to be devastating to men and especially going to be devastating to the next generation. So, I want to thank her, Tonia McDonald, for putting up with the mess that she's had to put up with 'cause you don't know what you getting into when you get into people and find out that after they smile and shake hands with you, and you get to know them, what happened in the past to them will come out to you. And so as we've been trying to build this model of how we should be, they, they could get mad at you. (Laughter) They should, they could, they could be happy one day about what you're doing and tell somebody else that I don't know what they know what they doing and not, so, you know, if, we've had what you call a lot of opportunities to meet a lot of people but we still see the same thing missing and that's the opportunity that we should all own something together and we should be independent of each other but we should all own the infrastructure to go. We've been preaching that at colleges, universities. We've been writing books and reports and everything else and the only one that seems to get it continues to be the Latinos, the Asians and the white folks. And so, if we didn't sell that to them, I'd probably have a sign that said, will work for food (laughter).

Speaker 1: I want to close this out by asking you this final question and that is, how would you like to be remembered by all of the people that you have been teaching and preparing for this wonderful model?
Speaker 2: I'll tell you. I've been thinking about that, a big tall building that says, McDonald [HistoryMaker Paul McDonald] on the top and over across the way, Frederick Douglas next to it and Phil Brown building next to it and the Tonia McDonald building right next to it because if we don't own the skyline of the future, we won't own anything except for a place on a museum wall where HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] will have our picture and our voices.
Story_ID: 442463
Speaker 1: Is there anything else you wanted to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I'd like to thank Mr. Eddie Thomas [HistoryMaker Eddie Thomas] and I think this is a historical day in the sense that Lou Myers [HistoryMaker Lewis Myers], the actor, was interviewed this morning about what we're doing, collectively, him in New York [New York], us in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and how he's working from the 1888 and peering over and seeing what our ancestors are talking about in the present, in a, in a third dimension and here we are in Los Angeles getting interviewed by The HistoryMakers and to be able to go into the future, Lou going into the past, in New York, two coasts, and in the center is every opportunity in the world for us to create that big picture of what we should be, how we should look, so we can bring graphic artists in and say, "How should our buildings look?" So, yeah, I can see my name across one of those buildings a hundred years from now. He said, there was a dude name McDonald [HistoryMaker Paul McDonald], he said that one day that that building who is now being torn down because we're creating another building and we got his picture and he say, we continue to build buildings. We continue to solve the problem of man. You see today, there's an opportunity. I got a chance, only one time in my life, to meet Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and that was a quite--just a natural meeting and, and I had a partner named Dwight McKee in Chicago [Illinois]. Dwight, I, I, I'm just shocked that he's not a HistoryMaker. He was Jesse Jackson's [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] first young man who believed and he was like Jesse's understudy and I was older than Dwight McKee by two years and I had the car but I had, I had to listen because there was a dichotomy that happened with one, [HistoryMaker] Ernie Banks being a mentor, now Jesse Jackson becoming a mentor and Dwight being the person that would get me into Jesse's house, I got a chance to know Jackie [Jacqueline Brown Jackson], I got a chance to know his little kids, got a chance to, to listen to him in a close environment 'cause I'll be at his house--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and, and yet, I don't think Jesse even know me because I was Dwight's, you know, I was like that spook who sat by the door.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, so when, when Jesse would have Richard Roundtree by, I had the car. So, one day Jesse was at, I mean, Dwight was at [HistoryMaker] Reverend Clay Evans' church [Fellowship Missionary Baptist Church] in Chicago, that was Jesse's sponsor when he first moved to Chicago, and so I'd drive, I'm the one who got a car and he calls me up, come and get me, I'm at church. So he said, "Put on a white shirt and come--," you know, I said, "Man, I don't want to go to church." He said, "Put on a white shirt and come on." Now, he fourteen, I'm sixteen, I got the car, I put on a white shirt. My mother [Josephine Harper McDonald] said, "Where you going?" "I'm going to church." She said, "Oh, boy, you're lying. No, you know you not going to church." I said, "Yes I am." So, so I parked and there was a whole bunch of people that was coming out of church and I'm, I'm walking through the, the church and there was a little room and there was a figure that was sitting there and was sitting back in the chair and I could tell that I'd seen his face before and I could tell that I, that I recognized him but I had never spoke to him. I had been in his presence 'cause being around Reverend Clay Evans and Jesse and all that, you know, every now and then I'd see him walking by there'd be a crowd around him, he was by himself and I, I didn't know what to say so the first thing that a young stupid black kid would say, "I want to be just like you," (laughter) and he looked at me and he almost said, "Are you crazy?" He said, "Be better than me," and I think the last thing that he said to me was, "Go into business, don't do what I do," and when I walked out of the place, it was later in my life that I thought of, that was the most profound thing that ever happened to me was to spend some, about, it was no more than two minutes.
Speaker 1: With who?
Speaker 2: Dr. Martin Luther King.
Speaker 1: There you are sir.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
