Story_ID: 631987
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your family.  I'd like to start with your father's side of the family.  Tell me your father's name, when and where he was born if, if you know.
Speaker 2: My father's name was Paul Raymond Valteau, Sr. [Paul R. Valteau, Sr.].  Do I need to spell that out?
Speaker 1: (Inaudible response).
Speaker 2: Okay.  He was born in New Orleans [Louisiana] January 2nd of 1918.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did he share any stories about his growing up?
Speaker 2: A few stories; unfortunately, my father's parents both died when he was still a, a small child, and his family was broken up, and therefore he did not have a lot of information or background about his parents or his ancestry.  He doesn't even--he didn't even know where his parents were buried, so we never had the opportunity to go visit my grandparents' gravesites.  It was a--he came from a very poor family; he only had about a formal education that took him to about the third grade but I, I doubt that I have met--I probably have, but there are very few people that would, that would--I would rank as smart as he was just from teaching himself things over the years--over the course of time. So there is very little I know about his father [Ferdinand Valteau] and mother [Marie Forneret Valteau].  The most I can tell you is that I do know that his father was a, a master violinist and had a band that performed in the one- Mike Lala's 101 club [sic.], which was a night spot that all of the prostitutes went to in Storyville [New Orleans, Louisiana] after they finished their duty--their work at very early in the morning.  I've also--he's also told me stories that his father, from time to time, performed with the New Orleans Symphony [New Orleans Symphony Orchestra] as a fill in.  And that's really about it.  I've heard a few other tidbits here and there. He--the family supposedly came to America originally along the Florida coast from the Caribbean.  My father told me that the history that he knew was that the, the, the patriarch of the family was fleeing France from criminal charges, and that the family arrived on the shores of the U.S. from the Caribbean--either Martinique or Haiti, or someplace around there.  Interestingly enough, I found a book ['The Diligent: A Voyage through the Worlds of the Slave Trade' Robert Harms] that was recently written about a slave ship called the Diligent, and the book describes that one of the officers on a slave ship was a Jean Pierre Valteau [sic. Pierre Valteau], and I suspect that--and I have not had the time; it's a recent discover of mine.  I, I found the book about a year ago and I haven't had the opportunity to do any research--any detailed research yet, but there are some in- some interesting coincidences; one of them is that the--one of the owners of the ship was named LeQuah [ph.].  My father's youngest brother's middle name was LeQuah.  The, the officer of Valteau, at the end of the saga of the slave ship, the Diligent, was charged by the owners of the ship with fraud and put on trial and convicted in, in, Nantes, France and could well be the person who escaped France and, and went to the islands and, and procreated and, and then had subsequent family members move to the U.S.  I've traveled a number of cities in France and I've represented the City of New Orleans in France at a number of events, and every time I got to France, I check the phone book and there are Valteaus in every major city in the phone book in, in, in France, so there obviously is some kind of connection; I haven't been able to, to figure out what it is.
Story_ID: 631988
Speaker 1: The other side of my father's [Paul R. Valteau, Sr.] family, he tells me, came from Indians [Native American] in the, in the Florida Panhandle, so it could be either Choctaw or Seminole Indians, I'm not sure what. And he doesn't know and neither did anyone else in the family, again, because he was estranged from his brothers and sisters at a very early age, there wasn't a really strong relationship, and now they're all dead except for the youngest sister, who is still alive, but she lives in Washington, D.C. and she really knows very little (laughter).  She knows even less than my father did, so at some point, I hope to be able to spend some time piecing together the history and background of the Valteau name and where it came from, and perhaps being able to find out who the matriarch of the family is and the patriarch of the family were.  It, it's very interesting, but that's, that's about as far as I can go with it (laughter), I just don't, don't have a lot of information beyond that on my father's side, and my father didn't even--doesn't even know what his mother [Marie Forneret Valteau] or his father died of; he has no idea, so it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Do you know their names?
Speaker 1: My grandfather's name was Ferdinand Fra- Fr- Ferdinand F. Valteau [Ferdinand Valteau], and the F stood for Francisco, I believe.  Don't know my grandmother's name--never knew it.
Speaker 2: Do you know who raised your father?
Speaker 1: One of his aunts.  Uh-oh, we lost the light.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay.  One of his aunts raised him; her name was Maude [Maude Forneret], and I don't know her last name, but it was not a loving relationship.  He was put to work at about, I think, ten or eleven years old, and worked the rest of his life to support himself and his family.  So, there really isn't much information I can give you on that side of the family.
Story_ID: 631989
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about your mother.  Tell me her name and, and when and where she was born.
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Udine Davis Valteau; she was born in New Orleans [Louisiana] on January 30th of 1921.  She was a, she was a twin. She is one of ten children--two sets of twins in the family.  My grandfather was William Herbert Davis, Sr. [William H. Davis], and he was born in Woodville, Mississippi on the Scott Plantation [ph.].  He is obviously the descendant--he, he may have well been a slave himself 'cause he died at ninety-seven years old in 1962, so he would have been around in the mid to late 1860s.  And in the backwoods of Mississippi, slavery went on for quite a long period after the Civil War, the Emancipation Proclamation, and the occupation of the South by the Union Army.  And I've never gone to Woodville to do any further research other than that; I can tell you that he was born on a Scott Plantation, he was buried in the Scott gravesite here in New Orleans.  My grandmother on my mother's side, Nellie Norman Davis, was born in Convent, Louisiana and was one of nine children. And it is my understanding that seven of the children were gi- females, and two of, two of them were males.  One of the males, a man who everyone called Uncle Bob [Robert Norman], spent most of his time in Angola state penitentiary [Louisiana State Penitentiary, West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana], accused of looking at a white woman.  And when I say, most of his life, he spent probably forty years in Angola and was released near his death, and I met him once or twice before he died.  The story that we hear about my grandmother is that there was a--an English sailor or officer who came to the United States on regular intervals--or came to Louisiana on regular intervals, and during those regular intervals, he was given my grandmother's mother as a concubine to have relationships with; from those relationships over the years, nine children were born; seven were women--were females.  And at some point, he offered the family to take the females back to England with him and the family refused, so they stayed and grew up in Convent, Louisiana.  They were later--my grandmother at, at a later date, married my grandfather, and they lived in New Orleans.  My grandfather learned the bricklaying trade and was the, the secretary-treasurer of the bricklayers' union [Bricklayers, Masons, and Marble Masons International Union No. 1] until his death at ninety-six years old, and continued to keep the books for the union.  And I can remember as a small child watching him lay the cornerstone on the, the union building--the newly built union building on Galvez Street in New Orleans.  This would have been probably in the late 1950s. And it was a very, very unique experience, a very interesting experience, and I came to appreciate it more as I, as I grew older and became an adult and understood what I had seen and, and the meaning--the impact of it.  So, that's about the most I can give you on my grandparents on my mother's side, which is a little more than, than my father's [Paul R. Valteau, Sr.] side of the family.
Story_ID: 631990
Speaker 1: Spell Udine for me.
Speaker 2: U-D-I-N-E. Interesting story about that--I was traveling in Europe with my parents [Udine Davis Valteau and Paul R. Valteau, Sr.], and we were in Italy, and I'm looking at the map and there's a city in Italy with the exact same name, except they pronounce it (pronunciation) Udine.  And so we--I went to the city on a subsequent trip to Italy; I went to the city because I wanted to see the city and, and--the city that had my mother's name--or my mother's name (laughter) was the same as the city.  And it was an interesting little city; it's right at the foot of the Alps in northern- northeastern Italy, and it's just peculiar; I don't know how she [Valteau's maternal grandmother, Nellie Norman Davis] came upon that name, but I guess when you're having ten children, you run outta names and you start thinking of (laughter)--'cause then--her twin sister's name was Undine [Undine Davis], and I don't know what that means but, as I showed you in the picture of them, they--they're fraternal twins; one is light-skinned like me, and the other one is brown-skinned.  So, it's--it was an interesting situation that, that developed there with the twins.
Story_ID: 631991
Speaker 1: Your mother's [Udine Davis Valteau] education?
Speaker 2: My, all of my, my grandfather's [William H. Davis] children, espe- the female--all of the female children received college degrees from Xavier University [Xavier University of Louisiana] in New Orleans [Louisiana].  They were all trained as teachers and they all taught school, so my mother was college educated at Xavier University and taught school for a number of years.  She went on and got a master's degree at the University of New Orleans [Louisiana State University in New Orleans; University of New Orleans, New Orleans, Louisiana] and did special, special education with children who were injured. She got out of the classroom and started teaching children at their homes who had extended illnesses and couldn't, couldn't get to class every day, so that's the extent of her education.  My father [Paul R. Valteau, Sr.] was, as I said, a third grade education, but a very knowledgeable man.
Speaker 1: Did your mother share any stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, often. Yeah, yeah.  There were lots of stories.  She talked about the, the Depression [Great Depression] and how, during the Depression, they shared food with the neighbors.  As you know, New Orleans, during that period of time, was a, a city of mixed neighborhoods and mixed neighbors, and one of the famous doctors over the years here in town grew up in the yard next to their yard--the two houses abutted, and she often talked about how they swapped food that--my grandfather had a garden next to his house--a large garden next to his house where he grew vegetables. And he would share the vegetables with the neighborhood in exchange for meat that they would get to--so that they would have balanced diets.  Everybody in the neighborhood had balanced diets and she talked about how her father would, would go with all of his daughters to the high- to the high school and college dances, and he would sit under the bleachers and sleep while they were having fun at the dances, and then walk them back home when the dances were over, 'cause there wasn't a great deal of mass transportation back then, and it wasn't that far; it was maybe three miles from where they grew up to where Xavier University was.  It was a lot closer to Xavier Preparatory School [Xavier University Preparatory School, New Orleans, Louisiana], which is where they went to high school.  And she talked about some of the things that went on in the family with her siblings.  With them growing up all at the same time, it was quite a spread with nine--one of the ten children died at an early age, so she talks ab- most of her remembrances were about the nine of them growing up together, and the, the particular idiosyncrasies of each of the, the children in the family and how they got along, and those kinds of things, so.
Story_ID: 631992
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your mother [Udine Davis Valteau] and father [Paul R. Valteau, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: There probably is (laughter), but (cough)--my guess is that as my father became a young adult, he was athletically inclined, and there used to be a segregated football--semi-professional football league in New Orleans [Louisiana].  There were about five or six teams that played at Xavier University stadium on Sunday afternoons.  And as a sideline, my father talked about how one year the Sugar Bowl invited Boston College [Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts] to come and play in the Sugar Bowl, and they came, and when they got here, the Sugar Bowl discovered that they had a black player on the team; he could not play in the Sugar Bowl, so they sent him over to play with  my father's team in the game that they were playing on New Year's Day, and I would imagine that around the same time that he was playing football with the--the team he played for was a team called the bruts. They had the north siders, the south siders, they had the, the pirates, and I've forgotten all of the other, the teams.  There were, as I said, about five or six teams that played. And I would imagine that he was playing football at Xavier University [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana], and they also practiced at Xavier around the time that my mother was a young coed on the campus, and they probably met up at some point in time during that phase of their lives.  I can tell you that--not to jump forward, but I can tell you that my father had made it up to the rank of sergeant in the [U.S.] Army in World War II [WWII], and he got busted because he went AWOL [Absent Without Official Leave] out of Alaska to come home so he could spend time with my mother, and so they could get married. And so he, he lost his sergeant stripes and went back to a private when he got back from his AWOL jaunt to New Orleans to marry my mother.  So they were clearly a, a loving couple and, and did for--and were for their entire lives.  But the, the relationship culminated in marriage in, I think, 1944, and I'm the oldest child.  I was born in '46 [1946], right after the war.
Story_ID: 631993
Speaker 1: My father [Paul R. Valteau, Sr.] told me stories of his time in service in the war [World War II, WWII].  I do remember that when he came back from the war he, he did spend some time in Italy and, and, and he participated in the invasion of Anzio beach [Anzio, Italy], and he did tell me that there were times when--he was in the Fifth Army [U.S. Fifth Army; U.S. Army North].  There were times when we would save money--not save money; we would buy extra canned goods and extra clothing and send to this family in Italy that took care of him while he was over there in the [U.S.] military, and I can remember that as a distinct memory from the early 1950s.  The other distinct memory I can remember is that we had--the Korean War was going on in the early 1950s and we'd also buy a couple extra cans of canned goods that my father kept in a cabinet so that--'cause he was certain that there would be another war (laughter), so.
Speaker 2: Wanted to make sure he's prepared (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, wanted to make sure that he was prepared, yeah.
Story_ID: 631994
Speaker 1: So you were telling me about how your father [Paul R. Valteau, Sr.] kept extra cans of vegetables just in case there was another war (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah he was--after coming back from, from World War II [WWII], he was convinced that there would be another war, and so we shopped, when we shopped at the grocery store on Saturdays, he would always buy two or three extra cans and put 'em in a cabinet that he had in his shed.  My father was kind of a handyman in addition to, to the regular job that he held and, and he was always building stuff, repairing stuff.  There were a number of kids on the, on the block that we lived on, and my home was the gathering place for all the kids in the neighborhood.  Next to my house was a lot, and my father got permission from the owner of the lot to put a baseball diamond in, and it was a small version of a baseball diamond, but it was perfect for us little kids and so we, we played ball in that, in that lot and, and be kept it clean and we had parties in that lot--birthday parties for everybody in the neighborhood.  All of the kids--when, when they were born, he would make a wagon for all of us to pull as a toy--a wooden box wagon that he made, and he also, at one point, made a little, a little dancing doll out of wood that stood about this tall (gesture), and you just giggled it from the top and would dance, and the arms and legs would, would move around, and so he was quite, quite a handyman and, and adept at those kinds of things.  And I, I spent a lot of quality time with my father during those years.  In addition to that, he became a coach for us at, at the neighborhood playground and we, we played baseball and football in, in, in the seasons and he was--he helped out with the coaches during those years and, and he also started a Boy Scout troop so that we would have camping activities to get involved in.  And it wasn't just for me, it was for all the kids in the neighborhood.  He, he--you know, as I said, my home was the, was the meeting place for everybody in the neighborhood and, and we'd all get together and do things together.  My parents would take us all swimming either in the lake before, before the, the segregated Pontchartrain Beach [New Orleans, Louisiana] was created, and then when it was, we would go to Pontchartrain--we would go to Lincoln Beach [New Orleans, Louisiana] I should say, not Pontchartrain Beach. Lincoln Beach, which was a segregated beach for African Americans to go to at that time, and we would go there swimming, and had a--just had a great time as kids.  It was--you know, the issues of today weren't issues that bothered us back then; we were, we were living a wonderful lifetime, we--our parents were always around and, and we always had activities.  We did things at Halloween, there would always be a party in the lot at Halloween, and there'd be apple dunking and that kind of stuff for all the neighborhood kids, and I don't know how they did it because there were meager incomes at the time, but they were able to do parties, and we always had a Labor Day party, a Memorial Day party, and a 4th of July party in addition to birthday parties in the neighborhood that we would have, so it was great fun.  And then when, when we weren't doing organized things, we--there was a group of about five of us kids that would always be there, and he would have us around him and we were always doing things with him and, and so it was great fun growing up in the neighborhood--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: --and with my parents.
Story_ID: 631995
Speaker 1: Tell me more about your neighborhood and some of your friends.  If you were to take me on a tour of a square block, tell me about the stores, who owned them, about your friends, their parents, and maybe even if you know the occupations or professions of the people in the neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What type of neighborhood was it?
Speaker 2: My--it was, it was a working class neighborhood.  My, my, my first cousin lived two doors away and his mother was a school teacher, his father was a plasterer. And he was born two months before I was born, so we grew up like brothers.  Next to him was another family--a single mother--a single parent family--a mother, and she had a son who was a year older than us but he was our size, and his name was Charles [ph.]; the first guy's name was David [ph.] and, and Charles and David and I just spent hours together as kids.  There were a couple of guy--couple of kids in the next block who played with us as well; they were about our age.  There was a fellow across the street name Herbert [ph.]; his daddy was a plasterer as well.  His mother was a homemaker.  Charles', Charles' mother and grandmother were both women who kept white people's houses--cooked and, and kept white people's houses.  And so it was a, a neighborhood of about six or seven, and the, the playground that we played in was about six blocks away, and as we walked to the playground, we would pick up kids along the way, and there were other kids who, who participated.  I, I'll never forget, as a kid, one of our--one year we had a, a football team, and of course we had no uniforms or anything, and one of our offensive linemen was a, a deaf kid, and so he couldn't hear any, any signals or anything and, and you'd have to pat him on the butt to (laughter), to let him know when the, when the play was starting, but he was a great--pretty good football player; he just couldn't hear anything.  And consequently, because he couldn't hear anything, he really wasn't able to speak very well. But it didn't matter, he was one of the neighborhood kids and so we all played together. So it's a--it was a, a great time in our lives at that point.  And, and having the guidance of our parents around was certainly one of the, one of the really special things about growing up during that period of time.
Speaker 1: So most of the households were two parent households?
Speaker 2: Many of them were; there were, there were a couple that were not.  My, my friend Charles, who is now a retired pharmacist in California, and at one point had three drugstores that he owned and operated, he, he did not have a father; his father was--had divorced his mother and was living in Chicago [Illinois], I think, at the time.  And I can think of one other kid but I can't think of his name right now, but everybody else had, had both parents in the household.
Speaker 1: What about the stores in your neighborhood?  Who owned them?
Speaker 2: We had a--they were owned by African Americans.  We had a, we had a, a, a small grocery store that was a half a block away; it was called Bowles, B-O-W-L-E-S, and it was owned by an African American man, and a lot of your basic everyday items were purchased in that store, plus he always had ice cold cold drinks (laughter), and potato chips and things that kids eat, you know (laughter), so we, we always had those items that we could go and buy.  And we also--we would also--I remember we would go to--and this gets into more of my memories.  As a kid, we would, we would go to Bowles grocery store and we would get Pepsi-Cola bottle caps, and with six Pepsi-Cola bottle caps you could get into the Lincoln Theatre [New Orleans, Louisiana] on Saturday mornings, and you could watch all of what they were showing on Saturday mornings at the Lincoln Theatre for six bottle caps, and so we would, we would walk to the Lincoln Theatre which was about a mile away (laughter)--a gang of us--about eight or nine of us, and everybody had their six bottle caps (laughter) and, and that would get us into the theater, and we would spend Saturday morning in the air conditioned movie theater.  Air conditioning was something no one had at the time (laughter) except movie theaters.  And that, that was great fun as well, so.
Speaker 1: And the movie theater was segregated?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was, it was.  Everything in New Orleans [Louisiana] was segregated back then.  You--even (laughter) from the time you were born 'til the time you were buried, it was segregated.  You went to, you went to black hospitals or no hospital, or you went to the Charity Hospital [New Orleans, Louisiana]--the one public hospital.  And all of the cemeteries were segregated; there were black sides and white sides in all of the cemeteries, and there were black funeral homes and white funeral homes and, and everything you did was segregated back then.
Story_ID: 631996
Speaker 1: When you think of a sound, a sight, or a smell, what takes you back to that time?
Speaker 2: Boy, that's--there's so many of 'em.  I think when I smell something cooking that smells like my mama's [Udine Davis Valteau] cooking, that brings me back to that time.  If I see an old--a really old car, like a 1950s car, that brings me back to that time.  Sometimes if I drive past an old building that's still is exis- that still exists--it may not have any activity in it but it still exists, it'll bring back memories of, of something that went on in that, in that place.  Like up until about two years ago, the Dryades Street YMCA [Dryades YMCA, New Orleans, Louisiana] which was the, the African American Dryades Street [Oretha Castle Haley Boulevard] location.  There were a lot of activities that we did at the Dryades Street YMCA, and anytime I pass that building I would remember; about two years ago it caught fire and burned down.  It's since been rebuilt, but if I drive past Lincoln Beach [New Orleans, Louisiana] where Lincoln Beach was, which was the segregated beach area, I have remembrances of the days as a child that we would drive out to Lincoln Beach and, and just had great fun on a, on a Saturday or if it's summer--if it was summer, on a week day, and just had a great time out there.  Sometimes when I drive past the, the playground that, that we played in as a kid, I have fond--both fond and sad memories of that location.  So it's--there are a lot of different things.  Driving up Dryades Street in uptown New Orleans [Louisiana] brings back fond mem- brings back interesting memories because Dryades Street was really where, where black people shopped, because if you came on Canal Street and bought something, you had to buy it; you couldn't try it on, and when you bought it, it was yours whether it fit you or not. So we did most of our shopping on Dryades Street.  I didn't even know Canal Street existed until I was almost twelve, thirteen years old 'cause we did all our shopping on Dryades Street.  So, things like that bring back memories.
Story_ID: 631997
Speaker 1: You said the playground brought back sad memories as well as good memories.  What was sad about the playground?
Speaker 2: It was, it was a time in my life when, when I discovered that I was--that there was something different about me in terms of being an African American as opposed to being part of the majority community.  I--at six years old I, I fell and cut myself on a piece of glass, and I was taken to a hospital and--the nearby hospital that was a hospital four blocks away, and the hospital refused to treat me because I was black, but they wouldn't tell my parents [Udine Davis Valteau and Paul R. Valteau, Sr.] that.  And so I sat in the waiting room bleeding to death--almost bleeding to death.  And at, at some point, someone came out and told my parents that this hospital was not gonna treat me, and they had better take me somewhere else before I died.  This was after sitting in the waiting room for about four hours on an afternoon, bleeding profusely.  I was then taken to a hospital that did sew me up.  I had lost so much blood they didn't have time to do a anesthesia on me.  The doctor had to sew me up, close the wound, stop the bleeding, and it was all done without anesthesia--six years old, seventy-five stitches in my right arm.  The doctor didn't even have time to repair the nerve damage, and so I've lived my life with no feeling in these two fingers, and unable to do this (gesture) with this hand (gesture).  So at a very early age I understood who I was and where I was, and I, I was kind of--I guess at--as I look back over the years, it--you know, it--I don't wanna say I'm glad it happened, but I do wanna say that having that happen to me gave me a unique perspective that, that probably a child at that age, and then growing up for the few years beyond that age, before the Civil Rights Movement started, did not--or gave me a different perspective of things than an ordinary child would have had.  So, from that standpoint, I appreciate what happened.  If I had it to do over again, I wish--I would not wish it to happen to me, but I appreciate the insight that it gave me as, as growing up--as a child growing up in New Orleans [Louisiana].  So--but it was also the, the place where some of my fondest memories were because we, we won some city championships in that same park--that same little ragtag team that didn't even have uniforms (laughter), and the, the, the exciting thing I can remember about that is, is one year we won the city championship and we didn't have uniforms, but our parents said they were gonna get us something (laughter) and, and they got us all baseball caps with, with a E on it, and we didn't know what the E stand for bec- stood for because there was no sign in the playground.  We didn't know what the name of the playground was (laughter). And so the playground was Evans Playground [New Orleans, Louisiana] (laughter), and so the parents knew, and they got us all these hats with the E on 'em.  We were excited to have the hats but we had no idea what the E stood for because there was no sign in the playground.  We used to call it Soniat park 'cause it was on Soniat Street (laughter).  So.

Speaker 1: Let's talk about your elementary school.  Where did you go to school?
Speaker 2: I went to school to a Catholic school, Blessed Sacrament Catholic grammar school [Blessed Sacrament School, New Orleans, Louisiana], and that was third through eighth grades. Kindergarten through second I went to Holy Ghost Catholic school [Holy Ghost School, New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about your teachers.
Speaker 2: They were all nuns.  They--you know--not, not really any great relationships there.  I, I, I don't know; for some reason I, I don't think I was very well liked by the, the nuns, and so I, I, I was happy to finish and get away from the nuns (laughter).  I can tell you that my cousin and I, David [ph.], who lived next door to me, we were both altar boys and we were often used and abused (laughter) by the priests.  When I say--let me correct that (laughter).  In terms of, in terms of demanding that we serve Mass many more times than any of the alt- other altar boys did simply because they knew they could rely on us to be there (laugher) where, where some other kids they might give 'em the, the instructions to be there at a certain time for Mass and they wouldn't show up.  But they knew our parents believed in discipline and, and were, were very strong supporters of the church, so if they gave us instructions and it would be weekly written instructions on  when you had to be at Mass, it--we'd bring 'em home and give it to our parents, our parents would make sure we were there.  So that was interesting in terms of, of the time we grew up and the time we spent around the church as kids.
Speaker 1: What type of student were you?
Speaker 2: At that point in my life, I was probably an average student.  Not probably, I was an average student (laughter).
Speaker 1: What was your favorite subject?
Speaker 2: Lunch (laughter).  No, probably history. History and geography; I, I really enjoyed those two subjects in, in grammar school.  I didn't have--the education was, was poor and I, I don't know who to blame for it; I guess part of it had to be that we were using books that were from the 1920s. 'Cause they, they were second and third hand books that'd be given to the Catholic schools by the public schools after they had worn out of 'em, so, you know, it was a, it was a hand me down education; it would be the term that I would use for it. So it, it wasn't a very good education but consequently I wasn't very interested in it. I was much more interested in, in the education that my father [Paul R. Valteau, Sr.] was giving me because he was an avid follower of world news and, and the daily happenings of, of things that were going on, and we often spent a lot of time in his little shed talking about things and me learning about things and learning about the world, and learning about his experiences in the world.  So, that was much more interesting to me than school was, and so I was at best an average student, which frustrated my mother [Udine Davis Valteau] (laughter) to, to all--have--being a school teacher.  She, she could not tolerate having an average student, which I was at that point in my life.
Speaker 1: So she, she taught school while you were in school.
Speaker 2: Not at the school, though; she taught at a, at a public school--Walter L. Cohen senior high school [Walter L. Cohen High School, New Orleans, Louisiana] she taught at, and it just frustrated her to no end that I had no, no real strong interest in, in education at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you, you had a lot of extracurricular activities but really nothing at school; just church, being a altar boy, but then you had the Y [Dryades Street YMCA, New Orleans, Louisiana]--
Speaker 2: In grammar school, yeah, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in grammar school, yeah.
Speaker 2: In my younger age, yeah.
Story_ID: 631999
Speaker 1: What high school do you go to?
Speaker 2: Went to St. Augustine High School in New Orleans [Louisiana], and thank God that was run by priests--men (laughter).  I got away from the nuns (laughter), and that was a very, very enjoyable experience; it was so enjoyable I stayed for a fifth year (laughter).
Speaker 1: To get--is there a special criteria to get into this particular school, or you can just go to that school?
Speaker 2: Well, you had to take a test to get admitted, and I'm, I successfully negotiated the test and was admitted, and I matriculated five years later.  I played in the band and met a lot of friends there, had a lot of good times there--lot of fun--and learned a little (laughter).
Speaker 1: What instrument did you play?
Speaker 2: Clarinet and saxophone.
Speaker 1: And were there any teachers who were influential there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, absolutely, absolutely--Edwin Hampton, who was the band director; my math teacher, Carl Blewin [ph.], he was was very influential; these were African American males.  This was the first experience I had with African American male teachers because my teachers up to that point they were all white nuns, and these two men were very instrumental.  Otis Washington, who was a history teacher and the head football coach, was also at--Eddie Flint, who was a math teacher and a football coach, was very instrumental in my, in my career at that point, as well as a number of the priests--Father Barnes [ph.], Father Grant [Robert Grant], Father Verrett [Joseph Verrett].
Speaker 1: Who was the principal at that time?
Speaker 2: Principal was Father Grant.  Assistant principal was a black priest called Father Verrett; he was very instrumental with a lot of, of young African American men.  He was, he was an outstanding man--an, an image to have as you, as you go into your young adulthood.  So they were, there were--those are fond memories, great memories, fond memories.  We--I, I did a lot at--during that point in my life.  Still was an average student, though; I, I don't wanna gloss over that.  I was still nothing more than an average student at that point.
Story_ID: 632000
Speaker 1: What were some of the other things that you did while you were at, at that school [St. Augustine High School, New Orleans, Louisiana] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, just, just--oh.  Real big thing was that that's when I got involved in the Civil Rights Movement back in 1963.  I spent several summers--actually, it was '62 [1962]--I spent several summers teaching people how to register to vote, and then trying to encourage them to go down to register, knowing that they were gonna get turned down the first two or three times.  There was an organization called the Greater New Orleans coordinating council [Coordinating Council of Greater New Orleans], and they would get us high school kids to come in, do that kind of stuff, and then we also picketed on Canal Street and around some of the other department stores.  There was a boycott going on at the time of the department stores in New Orleans [Louisiana]. And so we, we picketed, protested, and regis- and attempted to register people to vote; taught 'em how to (unclear).  In fact, I saw Dr. Martin Luther King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] great I Have A Dream speech in the, in the kitchen of a woman in- woman's home in the housing project where I was teaching her how to, how to register to vote. We, we would work the whole summers.  There was a team of five of us, and we would go out and work as a team in, in the black neighborhoods in, in many of the housing projects, and encourage people to register.  And it wasn't just the process of teaching 'em how to register, we then had to build up their confidence enough to get 'em to come down to the corner on, on Friday mornings to get on a bus to be taken down to city hall to try to register to vote, and that was a great, great accomplishment when you could get the people that you had been working on all week to teach them how to fill out the forms and everything, and what to say, to then get them to come down to the bus and get on the bus and ride down to city hall and go in and attempt to register.  Those were the brave souls (laughter) in my world at that time--not me. We were just, you know, having fun and, and kids on a mission, you know.
Speaker 1: What was the voting process like?  You, you said for them to attempt, knowing that they would be turned down.
Speaker 2: You had to, you had to fill out a card which asks for a lot of personal information, you had to bring at least two pieces of information that showed that you were a resident of that address. So we had to teach 'em how to fill out the card, which questions to answer on the card. We had to make sure that they had documentation that they lived at that residence. Excuse me. And then there was always the question that the registrar or the deputy registrar would ask you to interpret some portion of the [U.S.] Constitution, and that's where--if you fill out the application right, and had the proper ID, then they would ask--they'd read you the Preamble to the Constitution and they ask you to interpret it, and whatever you said, you were wrong, so they'd send you back home, unregistered.  So, and what you'd have to do is you'd--get sent home, you'd have to go back and visit with 'em and say, "Okay, that was the first time; let's try again; we can, you know, we can do this; this can happen so let's keep working on it."  And some people, to their credit, continued to, to do it until they finally got registered.  Some people did not.  Some people were afraid, and I can understand why they would be afraid.  But, you know, as I said, those are the real heroes--those people who, who had jobs that were dependent upon a white community and they were fearful that--and had reason to be fearful--that going to register would, would expose their name to possibly losing their job or something like that.  I mean I, I applaud those people and I think about 'em every day--every single day, 'cause we wouldn't be where we are today without them taking the steps that they took to, to do it, so we--and then we would, we would hold mass protests at city hall where we would chant and sing and--our old civil rights songs and, and just, just make a big commotion to try to force the city to understand and appreciate that we were not going away, and that they needed to open up the, the voter rolls so that we could get people registered.  I mean at that time I, I was at least four years away from being old enough to--no, more than that 'cause at that point you had to be twenty-one to register, so I was--I'm--you talking about somebody who's fourteen years old--fourteen, fifteen years old.  So I was, I was quite--and I was six years away from, from being--six or seven years away from being eligible to register myself, but thank God my parents [Udine Davis Valteau and Paul R. Valteau, Sr.] understood the importance of, of the time, and encouraged me to be involved in it.
Story_ID: 632001
Speaker 1: I did that and it was a lot of fun.  Once we got arrested and we all went to jail to (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Tell me about that time.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, it was about two hundred of us protesting in front of city hall and they came and took us away in groups in paddy wagons and took us down to the 1st District police station, and the lawyers were there.  We used to meet at the--I think it was the Greater Tulane Avenue Baptist Church [Tulane Avenue Baptist Church; Tulane Memorial Baptist Church, New Orleans, Louisiana], and we would meet there after school or if it was on a weekend we'd meet there and, you know, we went through a training session where you were taught to leave everything there, and you couldn't have a pencil or a pen 'cause they would raise the charge and charge you with carrying a concealed weapon or something, so you--and we would, you know, sing and get ourselves hyped up and hear, hear talks from people and, and, and then we'd empty out our pockets, except you needed to have some ID.  And, and then we would, we would go out to--in buses and be dropped off at the location, given our picket signs and--or if we were going out to register people, give 'em a stack of the registration cards and, and go out and start knocking on doors and talking to people and asking 'em to register, or go and walk up and down in front of stores on Canal Street and, and picket.  So, it was fun for us.
Speaker 2: And how were your parents involved in the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 1: Well, my father [Paul R. Valteau, Sr.] worked for the government because he was a mailman, federal government, so he could not be involved.  And my mother [Udine Davis Valteau] worked for the school system, and they told their employees that they couldn't be involved, so they really weren't, and they, they did their involvement through me.  But I can't say that--I can say that they were very encouraging and supportive of my participation in these activities, and I thank them for that, you know, so.
Speaker 2: Well, after you would get arrested, you said the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That only happened one time.
Speaker 2: One time?  Okay.  But who were the attorneys that were there for you?
Speaker 1: Collins [Robert F. Collins], Douglas [Nils Douglas], and Elie was the law firm--Bob Collins, Nils Douglas, and Lolis Elie.  And Morial and Tureaud and--would, would also be there. Dutch Morial and, and A.P. Tureaud, who filed some of the earlier civil rights cases to integrate and desegregate the ac- the activities in New Orleans [Louisiana].  Those are the attorneys that would be there.
Story_ID: 632002
Speaker 1: Do you think that those days and times had anything to do with your decision to become a lawyer?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, yeah, yeah.  My, my activism then also directed me into politics, and once I got older, I understood from that point that you change the system by being involved in electoral politics, and that led me in that direction.
Speaker 1: So, as we're still in high school [St. Augustine High School, New Orleans, Louisiana], is there anything else that, that happened that's significant during your high school years?
Speaker 2: No, no; it was a, a lot of fun times.  I guess I, I had a, a sort of a confrontation with my parents [Udine Davis Valteau and Paul R. Valteau, Sr.] (laughter) in my, in my junior year when, when I indicated to them that I, I had no interest in education, and that I wanted to, wanted to go into the [U.S. military] service and, of course, they said, "Not, not gonna happen" (laughter).  "And if you get into a college, you're gonna go to college," and I thank God for them because I was hell bent on destroying my life (laughter) waste- wasting away my time, but--yes.
Story_ID: 632003
Speaker 1: Right before you graduate, Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] is assassinated.  What do you remember about that?
Speaker 2: That's one of those days that you'll never forget.  I was, I was sitting in high school [St. Augustine High School, New Orleans, Louisiana] in a Spanish class.  In fact, we were taking a test and they stopped the test, made the announcement over the loudspeaker and, and sent us all home. And I was happy to get out of the Spanish test.  And I had some idea of, of the importance of what it meant.  I, I can vividly remember many of the people in the white community here celebrating the fact that Kennedy had been assassinated and I, I was very offended at that. Those, those are my, my recollections of that, that period.  It, it, it's very vivid.  I can tell you exactly the row and the desk that I was sitting in on that day; much the same for Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy] and Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  I can remember those, those days also. And the same way that I remember--I was on--in, in both in--both Bobby and Martin Luther King, their deaths took place, I think, three months apart or something like that; in both instances I was in college at Dillard University [New Orleans, Louisiana] and in, in one instance I was in a class, and when I came out of class I heard the news about Bobby Kennedy.  In the other instance, I was sitting in the, in the student center when I heard about Martin Luther King's assassination and, and I was one of the students that organized a protest march to downtown--to city hall, as a result of Dr. King's assassination. So I, I--my, my activities in the Civil Rights Movement continued once I, I started in high school, continued through college, and myself and a number of my friends were instrumental in, in bringing about some black studies activity on Dillard University's campus in, in the late '70s [1970s], and having a, a week of celebration--black, black history celebration week on the campus.  And it, it, it continued through my law school [Loyola University New Orleans College of Law, New Orleans, Louisiana] and, and eventually went into electoral politics (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 632004
Speaker 1: So, you graduate from high school [St. Augustine High School, New Orleans, Louisiana] in 1965.  How do you decide Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana] is the school that you're gonna go to?
Speaker 2: Some things that I wanted to do, and some things that were outside of my, my ability to control (laughter).  I wanted to get away from religious schools. I did not wanna go to a religious school, a school that had religion as its, as its driving force. So that helped, that encouraged me, and then, and then also because I, I would--continued to be a mediocre student at that point--that certain options were closed to me at that time. So Dillard was the best choice I had available, and I was glad I went. Glad they accepted me.  It was a very eye opening experience, continued to be an eye opening experience and it, it, it gave me the independence of thought that I, I really felt I needed, and it also really whet my appetite for, for learning.  I can really say that I--my senior year of high school and, and, and my college years were just blossoming into a, a real student of everything, and wanting to know as much as I could know about everything that, that was around me, so it, it opened, opened the eyes and opened the mind and, and did a lot of things.
Speaker 1: What was your major?
Speaker 2: I was a sociology major.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: But I took courses across the spectrum just because I was, I was interested.  I wanted to know as much as I could know; I didn't--suddenly realized all the stuff I was missing (laughter), and got excited about education.
Speaker 1: Who was the president of Dillard at that time?
Speaker 2: Albert Dent [Albert W. Dent].
Speaker 1: And were there professors or instructors that were influential to--in your world?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dr. Daniel Thompson [Daniel C. Thompson], who was a noted sociologist, Dr. Barbara Guillory [Barbara Guillory Thompson], Dr. John Furey--those were all people that taught me and people that also--and had some influence on my career.
Story_ID: 632005
Speaker 1: Dr. Furey [John Furey] was a political science professor, and I took a couple of courses because I had an interest in that area, and in my junior year he--I was looking to go to the Atlanta school of--graduate school at Atlanta University, graduate school of social work [Atlanta University School of Social Work; Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Atlanta, Georgia], and in my junior year he said to me, "Son, have you ever thought about going to law school?"  And I said, "Law school?  No, why would I wanna do that?"  Well, when he said that, it made me remember something that my father [Paul R. Valteau, Sr.] did to me a couple a times.  As I told you earlier, my father was a mailman, and when I was a kid, I would go--from the time I was about--old enough to ride a bicycle, he had hooked up a contraption where I attached to the rear of my bike this little wagon that had two wheels on it, and I would--in the summertimes, when I wasn't old enough to get a real job, I would ride around behind him on his route on the days that people put out their trash. And when people put newspapers out, I would pick up the newspapers, put 'em on my bike, bring 'em home, and then we'd tie 'em up, stack 'em up, and sell 'em to the junkyard for a nickel a pound, and that's how I made spending money when I was a kid.  And my father would always point out the houses of lawyers, and he would tell me, he said, "Son, when you, when you grow up, you wanna be a lawyer 'cause that's the people who make all the money."  He'd show me, "This house here this is so and so lawyer," and, "This is such and such judge," and that kind of stuff.  And I guess it, it kind of left an impression way back there in the recesses of my mind and, and this political science professor came up to me when I'm a junior in college [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana], and said, "You ever thought about going to law school?"  And I said, "No, I never thought about it."  I say, "Wait a minute."  I went home that night and I say, "Wait a minute. Dad, you know, he used to, he used to tell me--he said judges and lawyers lived in these big houses, make lots of money."  I said, "Maybe, maybe I do wanna be a lawyer."  So I said, "I'll look into that."  Next day, I went back to the professor, I said, "Give me some information on that; let me, let me, let me think about it."  And he did, and of course it upset the sociology department because I was one of their star students (laughter), and they were for sure that I was gonna go and get a Ph.D. in sociology and, and write books and, and do that kind of stuff, and I got interested in law and, and went into that field, not knowing anyone who was a lawyer (laughter).
Speaker 2: Were there any other times--what did you do during the summers while you were in, in college?
Speaker 1: Let's see; one summer I worked for the labor department [U.S. Department of Labor], Wage and Hour Division; the other two summers I worked as a waiter, waiting tables in restaurants to make money. And the--well, I guess that would have been--let's see, I did--there was something else I did one other summer; what did I do?  I can't remember right now.  And then the summer after I graduated, half of the summer I, I went to a pre-law program at the University of Cincinnati in Ohio [Cincinnati, Ohio].
Speaker 2: How did you decide what law school you would go to?
Speaker 1: I was in--I was accepted to several law schools and it was a matter of money, as it is in most cases.  I started out at the University of Cincinnati in Ohio, and I discovered in class that every time I asked a question, the, the professor would say, "Well, here's how it is in Ohio. We don't know how it is in Louisiana."  So, after that semester, I said, "You know, maybe if I'm gonna stay in Louisiana, maybe I need to go back," (laughter), "to a Louisiana law school."  So I--I had been accepted to all of the law schools in Louisiana so I, I, I called 'em all and asked 'em what would they give me to come to school (laughter), and Loyola [Loyola University New Orleans College of Law, New Orleans, Louisiana] gave me the best deal, so that's where I went (laughter), so.
Story_ID: 632006
Speaker 1: So tell me the difference from going to--you know, going from undergrad [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana] to law school.  What did you expect, and what did you find?
Speaker 2: I think the--one of the vivid memories I had is, is, is I was a superstar in undergraduate school and, of course, it was an HBCU [historically black colleges and universities], and I wasn't sure that I could match up in the white world. And I can tell you that they--when I went to this program in, in Ohio, they sent us all--they gave us all a train ticket to go to the program and it was an excruciating sixteen hour ride on a train from New Orleans [Louisiana] to, to Cincinnati, Ohio, and I spent many of those hours worrying about whether or not I would be able to match up. So there was great self-doubt initially.  When I got there and realized that I was able to match up, there was great relief. But then there was still really, really hard serious study that had to take place, and so, you know, the, the flow of material was, was a lot faster than it was at the college level, so you had to immediately jump in and, and stay up late nights reading and studying, and trying to understand things, and it was an interesting group of people that, that I was in with, so. My, my roommate at the time was a, a very strong Black Muslim.  It was called Black Muslims at that point--not, not the Nation of Islam, as it is today.  And he had a number of weapons in, in his locker on campus, and (laughter) I didn't say anything about it, but he was extremely militant young man.  I think he went on to become a lawyer; I have not heard from him since that time--since I left that, that university [University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio] and came back to Loyola [Loyola University New Orleans College of Law, New Orleans, Louisiana].
Story_ID: 632007
Speaker 1: Interesting story, another interesting story.  There were myself and a, and another guy from that Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana] graduating class decided to go to law school; his name was Richard Stewart [Richard G. Stewart, Jr.].  His brother, who's a year younger than he, is now on the United States appeals court bench--Carl Stewart [Carl E. Stewart]--in the Fifth Circuit [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit], down here in New Orleans [Louisiana]; he went to law school obviously, also.  Richard and I were in the freshman class at Loyola University law school [Loyola University New Orleans College of Law, New Orleans, Louisiana]; there were 158 students in that freshman class, if I'm not mistaken.  Richard was from Shreveport [Louisiana], I was from New Orleans; Richard's draft board was in Shreveport, my draft board was in New Orleans.  There were 158 students; two students got drafted out of that freshman class.  Would you like to take a guess on who they were?  Richard and myself (laughter)--strange coincidence.  Richard went on and volunteered for the [U.S.] Navy, and did a career in the JAG Corps [Judge Advocate General's Corps].  The Navy put him through law school and he did a career in the JAG Corps, not at Loyola; he--maybe--he went to law school other places.  He moved around in the Navy and finished his law career and worked as a, as a JAG officer for many years, and then retired from the Navy.  Remember this (gesture) and that (gesture)?  That got me out of Vietnam because I couldn't salute; I couldn't (gesture) hold my fingers together to salute, (gesture) so I was drafted, and I reported and took my physical and I passed everything and, and then I whipped out the letter I had gotten from the doctor that I had an ulnar nerve palsy, and the, the Marines [U.S. Marine Corps] were, were drafting people at that time 'cause we were getting killed so fast in Vietnam, and so they lined us all up, and this Marine drill sergeant came through and he picked who he wanted and picked me, and so I was in the Marines for about a day and a half, or two days because they didn't believe me at first, and they didn't believe my doctor certificate, so they put me through some tests and they finally decided that I did in fact have a disability, and so they released me and I went back to Loyola and finished up.  And that was some--that--those were interesting years as well, at Loyola University law school.
Story_ID: 632008
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about the time, the classes, the, the professors, how you're getting along with the other students.
Speaker 2: Except for the fellow that's in this law office, I didn't get along with any of the other students.  At that point in my life, I was wearing a very large Afro, and I was not very well liked by the students.  It was--when Richard left to--Richard Stewart [Richard G. Stewart, Jr.] left to go into the [U.S.] Navy, it left two African American students in the entire law school [Loyola University New Orleans College of Law, New Orleans, Louisiana]--a fellow who was graduating, and myself, in the freshman class.  And I looked around and I said, "You know what?  This is gonna change."  And I (laughter) got back on my militant horse and I went into the dean of, of, of the university--of, of the law school and I said, "You know, I look around and I don't see anybody that looks like me in these classrooms," and I said, "That disturbs me."  And I said, "I'm hearing that you have an application in for money from the federal government to build a new law school."  He said, "Yeah."  I said, "Well, I'm gonna object to it unless you give me some money and a budget that I can go out and do some recruiting of African American students into law school."  And he said, "You wanna do that?"  I said, "Absolutely."  So he said, "Sure, we'll put money in the budget."  And so I did--law school is three years long; my first two years, I spent most of my time recruiting other college age--college level, not age--college level graduating seniors to come to law school at Loyola University.  I succeeded very well. At, by the time I graduated, there were thirty students--thirty African American students in Loyola law school.  I founded the, the BALSA [Black American Law Students Association; National Black Law Students Association] chapter at Loyola University, and co-founded the BALSA chapter with a good friend of mine name Ronald Nayborn [ph.] at Tulane University [New Orleans, Louisiana], and I was a member of the, the national law schoo- law student civil rights organization [Law Students Civil Rights Research Council].  I was on their national board of directors for two years while I was in law school.  I was also the first African American student that the justice department's [U.S. Department of Justice] Civil Rights Division took to work in the justice department from the Deep South in over fifty years. So I, I had those opportunities which were great.  Some, some of the people I recruited--I recruited a, a young man who eventually became the dean of the law school at Loyola University, and then went on to be the dean of the law school at the University of Mississippi [University of Mississippi School of Law, Oxford, Mississippi].  Unfortunately, he had a heart attack and died as dean of the law school at the University of Mississippi.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Louis Westerfield.  I recruited--as I told you earlier, I recruited [HistoryMaker] Ivan Lemelle and a number of people who are successful practicing lawyers around town. So I thought I, I accomplished my goal at that point in life, which was to get more, more African Americans in law school.  While I was a superstar in undergraduate school [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana], I was a semi-superstar in law school because I was spending a lot of my time on recruitment activities, although I did get the honors in, in a couple a classes in law school.  Trial practice was the one I'm most proudest of; I was the, the young man who was the, the best of the students who attempted to practice l- learn how to practice law in actual conditions in courtrooms while you were still in law school. So from there I, I graduated--I'm sorry; you, you wanted to ask something?
Speaker 1: Who was the dean while you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The dean was Antonio Papale [Antonio E. Papale] who, who was the dean of the law school at that time, and he was there my first year, and then the second two years the dean was a fellow name Marcel Garsaud [Marcel Garsaud, Jr.].  And Papale's dead.  I haven't heard--I haven't seen or heard from Garsaud in years, so I don't know if he's still around.

Speaker 1: The program or the, the job that you had with the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice], can you tell me a little more about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I went to work for the justice department, Civil Rights Division Criminal Section, and that's the section that prosecutes law enforcement agencies and, and members of law enforcement who violate people's civil rights--the 1983 statute--1983 and '84 [1984] statutes.  The very first investigation they put me on was one that involved a, a little town in Ludowici, Georgia that had one traffic light but it was on highway 1 [U.S. Route 301], the north-south--the main north-south highway from Maine to Florida.  And they used that one highway light to fund the entire budget of the City of Ludowici, Georgia 'cause they would sit a policeman out there twenty-four hours a day with a remote control, and whenever he saw traffic coming, he would change the light to green, and soon as you got to (laughter) he would change it to red, and he would chase you down--chase you down and write you tickets (laughter).  So, that was the first investigation they put me on.  I did have a very interesting experience at, at that job as well.  I was arrested there for bank robbery and auto theft.  We were investigating a murder at the Chattahoochee state mental institution [Florida State Hospital, Chattahoochee, Florida] and I was sent down to do some interviews of some people.  At the time, we didn't know that the guard who had killed this individual in the, in the mental institution was a, a relative of the sheriff of the parish--of the county.  And I had done a couple of interviews in the state mental institution and, and then was driving the rental car back to the Tallahassee airport [Tallahassee Municipal Airport; Tallahassee International Airport, Tallahassee, Florida] to fly to Tampa [Florida] to interview another individual, and we pulled up--I was pulled over by a city police car from the town of Quincy, Florida, and the policeman made me get out, raise my hands and, you know, patted me down, searched me and asked who I was.  I identified myself, and he asked me for my formal identification.  I told him it was in the glove compartment; he got it, looked at it, and he said, "Well, you look like somebody we're looking for."  I said, "Really?"  He said, "Yeah."  He said, "And you're driving a stolen car."  He said, "You, you--we think you committed a bank robbery in Miami, Florida, and this is a stolen car from there."  I said, "No, I just rented this car this morning at the Avis Rent A Car [Avis Rent A Car System]."  He said, "Unh-uh, you stole it."  So they took me back and put me in jail. And, and the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] found me the, the guy I was gonna interview next; when I didn't show up for that interview, called the FBI, they backtracked and they found me in the jail and got me out.  So, that was an interesting story.  I, I left that job (laughter) shortly thereafter.  I decided I didn't want a lifetime of being arrested and harassed by police (laughter), so.
Speaker 1: Were you still sporting your Afro?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, proudly (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 632010
Speaker 1: Now, a little bit more about the cases.  You said you were, you were most proud about the actual--working in the courtrooms in the, in the--well, kind of tell (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, that was in law school [Loyola University New Orleans College of Law, New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That was just, that was just indigent defendants--indigent clients that needed representation and couldn't afford it, and the court would appoint the, the law school to represent 'em and we'd have lawyers who acted as professors who would help us through the cases, representing the people.  I--when I said I was most proud of that, that was during my legal career--during my law school career.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: There were a couple a cases I handled after that.  One was there was a chain of bakeries--a chain of retail stores that, that were outlets for a bakery here in New Orleans [Louisiana] called McKenzie's, and they had a, a habit of--no matter where the store was located, only white women could operate the cash register in the store.  They had black employees, they would wait on people, but when they finished waiting on you, they told the white cashier what you had, how much it cost, and the white cashier took your money and gave you your change.  So, this was in the 1970s; I think this was '73 [1973] or '74 [1974].  So these three young women came to me and asked me to represent 'em because they felt like they were being discriminated against and, and I sued and eventually we settled with 'em, and they removed that policy and allowed African American women to handle money in their stores.  So that was one of the, one of the cases I handled that--there were still instances of segregation around the city and around the South.
Story_ID: 632011
Speaker 1: You got your J.D. degree in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen seventy-two [1972].
Speaker 1: Seventy-two [1972].  (Pause) So, where do you go after--well, tell me about the bar--taking the bar exam.
Speaker 2: It wasn't anything special.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was a, a group of us who studied for the bar together, and we all passed except one of us, and he passed, I think, the next year.  But we've, we've all had success in the practice of law.  One, one fellow's a judge, one fellow was a congressman, and the rest of us were lawyers.  I was elected sheriff.  So everyone's been successful but, you know, it--it's a limited number of people back then--a number of African American people who were passing the bar exam at that time.  But I think we were all confident; we studied together, we took a bar review course together, and we were all confident that, that we were gonna pass it and we did.  So, I--there was nothing memorable about that other than the fact that we studied together, we worked hard at preparing ourselves, and we took the exam and we expected to pass and we did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that was not anything especially memorable.  I went to--as soon as I passed the bar, I went to work for Reginald Heber--I received a fellowship--a Reginald Heber Smith fellow- poverty lawyer fellowship [Reginald Heber Smith Community Lawyer Fellowship Program], and I went to work for the poverty program here in New Orleans [Louisiana] as a lawyer. I did that for a year and a half, and then I went to work for the Louisiana Legislature [Louisiana State Legislature] as a house counsel for one of the committees that was rewriting the juvenile laws in Louisiana, and I did that for three years, and then I went into private practice and I did that for about five years, and then I ran for public office and got elected sheriff.
Speaker 1: Well, let's, let's take these, these steps--what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You work for a private law firm.  When do you decide that it's time for you to have your own private practice, and why?
Speaker 2: I guess it was a, a--the circumstance as much as anything else.  I think that most people, when they go through law school, hope to have the ability to have a practice at some point, particularly if you're interested in being a trial lawyer rather than a transactional lawyer, and I wanted to be a trial lawyer; I had a big mouth and I liked to talk a lot (laughter), so, so--and I was very opinionated, and I knew my opinion was right--all the time (laughter) back then.  I have since learned that I wasn't always right.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: It's just about 98 percent of the time (laughter).  I'm just kidding.  So, what happened was, when I worked in the legislature--when I left the poverty program and went to work in the legislature, I left a law office; I was operating out of a law office in the poverty program, and so when I went to work in the legislature, the legislature meets in Baton Rouge [Louisiana], and so all of my work was in Baton Rouge, but I was living in New Orleans [Louisiana] and I didn't have a law office. I didn't have a desk, a chair, a telephone, business cards, or anything like that, so the only work I was doing was for the legislature.  As that began to wind down, I could see that I was gonna need something to do, or either I was gonna have to move to Baton Rouge and continue to do work as a lawyer for government in Baton Rouge, or I'd have to find a place to settle.  So, what I did was I looked around and there happened to be a vacancy in former Mayor Dutch Morial's [Ernest Morial] old law firm [Thierry and Gerdes, New Orleans, Louisiana] and I, I was invited to come in and practice with those guys and, and I did, and so that's how the decision was made to, to have, have a private law practice.
Speaker 1: And were there any memorable trials or cases?
Speaker 2: Well, that's when I had, had the, the case involving McKenzie's bakery.
Speaker 1: McKenzie's bakery.
Speaker 2: And I also, at one point, represented a fellow from the longshoremen's union [International Longshoreman's Association] who was attempting to run for president, and we didn't win that case, but he, he wanted to make some major changes in the local longshoremen's union that would have been dramatic but he--as I say, he didn't win.  So--and it was just basically a family law office; it wasn't, wasn't a high powered law firm, it was just a--three guys who were doing whatever came through the front door: divorces, family matters, wills and estates, that kind of stuff.
Story_ID: 632012
Speaker 1: Tell me who Dutch Morial [Ernest Morial] is.
Speaker 2: Dutch Morial is, is the first African American mayor of New Orleans [Louisiana].  I was his campaign manager and ran his campaign when he ran and won the first time.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-seven [1977] was his campaign; took office May 3, 1978, and I, I ran his first campaign for mayor.  He and I were good friends, and remained good friends until he died.  It was a very exciting time; it was a time when, when the African American community was beginning to feel its muscle as a voting bloc, and could make decisions that--as a, as a voting bloc could make decisions that were important to the community, and--I'll never forget he, he came in and he said, he says, "You know I'm, I'm on the court of appeals [State of Louisiana Court of Appeal for the Fourth Circuit] now, but I think I can be the next mayor."  And so I said, "Okay, well, let's do it."
Story_ID: 632013
Speaker 1: You con- continue with that--
Speaker 2: He--yeah, he, he came in to me one day; we--he had a habit of coming by the law office [Gerdes and Valteau]; he was a judge at the time, and he had a habit of coming by the law office two or three times a week on the way home and we'd just sit around and talk, you know, politics, talk the world, and things like that.  At one point he came in to me and he said, said, "You know I'm, I'm a judge now, but I think I can win the mayor's race."  I said, "Well, I think you can, too."  So he said, "Well, you wanna get involved?"  I said, "Heck, yeah."  So we started out very, very poor in terms of political campaigns.  We started out in a situation where the, the first thing he wanted to do was take a poll, but he didn't have the money to pay for a pollster; however, he had talked to a pollster and gotten him to do a poll if we provided him with the names and phone numbers of fifteen hundred voters in the city that he could use to poll.  So, I organized a group of people, including my, my parents [Udine Davis Valteau and Paul R. Valteau, Sr.], to come to the law office three or four nights a week and take this voter registration list, and take a telephone book and match up the names of the people in a phone book with the (laughter), the registered voter so that we could give this pollster a list of registered voters with phone numbers so that he could call and do the poll.  Dutch's [Ernest Morial] family was involved in it, too, and, and several other people, and so we--that's how we started out.  He took his first poll and it came back very favorably and then we began to organize people and, and put together a campaign, which ultimately led to his election as the first African American mayor in the City of New Orleans [Louisiana].  And it was, it was quite a time; it was a great of excitement, a great deal of anticipation, and he was a, he was a, a terrific guy; he was, you know, really, really a top flight guy.
Speaker 1: He was a terrific guy, but was he a good mayor?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  He was, he was a better mayor than he was a political candidate (laughter), and he was a great political candidate.  He had, he had major issues to deal with and, and he handled 'em all and he was a, a, a, a great leader in, in terms of being a public official.  He understood what, what being a public official was all about.  He had a, he had a, a couple of phrases that he used to like to use when he was campaigning; he always told people, "I wanna--I want to promise meagerly but deliver extravagantly."   Because he understood that in the African American community, the first time that an African American got elected mayor, there would be great anticipation, and he understood that you needed to temper that anticipation with the factual realities of the day. That, yeah, he was gonna get elected mayor, but he couldn't do everything and, and all of the problems weren't solved immediately upon his election as mayor, so he understood the need to temper the anticipation, excitement, and, and interest in the black community but he also understood that he needed to quell the concerns and the fear in the white community, and he was very accomplished at that; he did a--did a very good job.
Speaker 1: What do you think was his greatest accomplishment as mayor?
Speaker 2: Bringing, bringing African Americans into government--into the mainstream of government was, was his biggest accomplishment.  We got a number of African Americans elected to judgeships, I got elected to sheriff four years later--after his election as mayor.  We ran together.  And I think that was his major accomplishment.
Story_ID: 632014
Speaker 1: So, you stay at, at the law firm [Gerdes and Valteau, New Orleans, Louisiana] until what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-one [1981].
Speaker 1: And this is when you decide to--
Speaker 2: Run for sheriff.
Speaker 1: --to run for sheriff?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what gave you that idea?
Speaker 2: Well, I had been introduced to the person who was sheriff at the time, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who was--
Speaker 2: His name was Milton Stire, and he was elderly; he was in his seventies and he was not healthy.  And he asked me if I would do some legal work for the sheriff's office and I told him I would, and after a couple a years he, he came to me and he said, "Listen, I'm not gonna make it, I'm gonna have to retire after this term.  Do you have any interest in running?"  And I said, "Well, I don't know, I'll think about it."  And I had run for a House of Representative seat [Louisiana House of Representatives] in 1975 and lost, and so I knew what I didn't wanna do in an el- in an election. And so I, I sat down and I, I put together a, a plan and a roadmap, and I went back to him and I said, "Okay, I'll consider running, but I have to have these things."  And, and we talked about 'em and how I could put 'em together; one of 'em was raising the kind of money you needed to have to spend in a citywide election, another was--a major issue was getting white voter support, and that's still an issue in the, in the Deep South, and particularly in New Orleans [Louisiana]--it's a major issue.  One of the most frustrating times I ever saw Dutch Morial [Ernest Morial] was after his second election when he had done just an outstanding job as mayor in his first four years--balancing the budget, bringing quality people into city government, laying out a vision for the city, and doing all these great things.  A building boom was going on, he built the convention center [New Orleans Convention Center; New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, New Orleans, Louisiana], that's why it's named after him; all of that was done in his first four years.  And then he only got 8 percent of the white vote in his reelection--8 percent.  And I never saw someone more disappointed than he was at the fact that all he could get was 8 percent. And he could only get 8 percent because a lot of the white community made a decision not to vote for him on superficial issues--nonsense, essentially.  So, that was a big, a big issue that I had concerns about.  As it turned out at, at the time, I got the largest white crossover vote that had--that any black candidate had gotten up to that point in time. It's been surpassed since then by a fellow name Sidney Barthelemy, who ran for mayor and won.  But even at my ti- I was running against--I--here I am a, a practicing attorney running against a white guy who was a high school graduate, and I could only get 29 percent of the white vote. And it's, it's, it's a troubling, and has always been in my mind, a troubling aspect of electoral politics in America that, that the African American community willingly will give its vote to any qualified candidate, regardless of their race or sex, but the white community does not reciprocate.  You have to be a Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] (laughter) to get white votes in America in large numbers, particularly in the South--in the Deep South, and I think that's a lingering problem that we have in America that I don't know if it'll ever be solved.  So, in putting together my campaign, that was one of the major concerns that I had that, that there would be problems with, with getting enough white votes to be able to win because while we had a, a, a small majority African American vote, the African American vote does not, did not turn out in numbers that surpassed the white voter turnout, so you could count on getting all of the, getting all of the black vote, but it was only (unclear) about 80 percent of the total black vote that came out and vote on any given occasion, and the white community, by voting in larger percentages, would outvote that number, so you had to--you had to make certain that you had legs in both community that you could stand--both communities--that you could stand on to, to be successful.  So we, we worked on it and put it together and, and I eventually was elected because of the trust, I guess, and faith that the voters put in me.
Story_ID: 632015
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about the sheriff's position.  Were there two sheriffs?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so explain what--explain about both of 'em (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) One sheriff is the city jailer--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that's all he does.  The other sheriff does everything else that a sheriff's office does; that's what--that's the position that I held, except that neither sheriff is, is responsible for the direct law enforcement responsibilities in the city--that's--the New Orleans Police Department does that.  So, what we did was, we protected the courts, we protected the public officials, we served all the subpoenas and notices, we--excuse me--we carried out the orders and judgments of the judges of the court, and we held auctions, seized property, did all of the--all of those--all of the, the functions that a sheriff's office does except house--except run a jail.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, were you looking forward to any changes that you would implement in your first year (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, absolutely.  When I took the office, even though my predecessor [Milton Stire] was a supporter of mine, he did--he had no--again, he was a, a person of, of little education, and he had no knowledge or understanding how to run a modern office, and so when I took over the office, the, the most modern piece of equipment that it had was a, a twenty year old Royal type- electric typewriter, and so I had to completely modernize the office. The first term that I was in office, and at the end of the first term I was the first office in the state--public office in the state to computerize with an old Wang system that the Louisiana State supreme court [Louisiana Supreme Court] has--an old, old mainframe system.  And then again in, in the year 1999, we were once again ahead of our time when we converted from that old system into a PC [personal computer] network, and we were the first public office to convert to a PC network, we were the first public office to have a website, an interactive website, where citizens could communicate with us through computer.  And so we trailblazed in a number of areas in terms of modernizing the office.  And when I first took over, no two desks matched, there were file cabinets all over the place, there was no system or structure to the office; anybody answered the phone and they would just shout across the room. It was like a big bullpen, and anybody--phone rang, anybody answered it; it if wasn't for them, they'd just shout across the room at whoever it was for, so we had to implement a complete structure and create an office--literally create an office, and then train people how to act and operate in an office.  It was a, a, a mighty task but I was up for it.  I was a young guy and I was full of vim and vigor and excitement, and I had a great time modernizing and then re-modernizing it the second time around.  And we also instituted a program where we did seminars on a weekly basis for people to come in--month--I'm sorry, a monthly basis for people to come in and learn about the sheriff's office--how it works, how it operates.  And I did the seminars and we put together a PowerPoint [Microsoft PowerPoint] program, which people could get online, if they wanted to, and find out information about the office.
Story_ID: 632016
Speaker 1: So it was significant. In addition to that I, I started--I really have never given up my, my volunteerism and my service to the public.  I started a reserve deputy association shortly after getting elected that, one point, had as many as four hundred members, and during the course of the first ten years of that organization, we estimated that we did somewhere around $7.5 million worth of volunteer services in the community.  We had men and women who would go out and speak; we had a speaker's bureau where we had people who would go out and speak to grammar school and high school kids, we had programs for the elderly, we had programs for the indigent, we had programs for children, and we just did every- all kinds of things. Just--it's amazing how the, the volunteer spirit can be ignited in a community when you have leadership that has some interest in it.  I've, I've been very fond of Alexis de Tocqueville's writings, and he visited the United States in, in the early 1800s, and he often wrote back to his friends in Paris [France] and France, and talked about how the volunteer spirit was the thing that really made America run, and that it was the most extraordinary thing that he had ever seen, and we did the--a similar thing with the sheriff's office; we, we created this volunteer spirit.  We, we, we had a, a school, the New Orleans creative arts school [New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, New Orleans, Louisiana], which is a place where the Marsalis boys went and Harry Connick [Harry Connick, Jr.] went, and a number of other people.  They had a art program where they didn't have a laboratory for students to work in, and the principal had this dream of creating the old janitor's home.  Back when the school was originally built, the school system would build a house next to the school for the janitor to live in so that he could be on the premises with the school at all times.  Well, this school didn't have a live in janitor anymore but they had this building, so we took the deputies in and we completely tore out that building and turned it around entirely and created the, the art studio that they needed, both a display space and a workspace for the kids.  I worked with--I was on--I was a member of the National Council of Negro Women at one point (laughter), and the local director had gotten someone to give her a plot of land and she had a dream of ultimately building a, a home for high school females who got pregnant, so that they could live in, have their babies, and continue their education at the same time.  And this person generously donated the land to her and to the National Council of Negro Women's local office.  There was only one problem--there was a dilapidated two story building on the land, so before she could even anticipate or think about a, a, a program to put this building together, this, this junk building had to be torn down. And so myself and my reserve deputies spent one summer demolishing that building and removing it from the site.  I then went on to the board of, of the local NCNW office and, and helped her put together the funding for the building, and it was eventually built.  It was called Liberty House [New Orleans, Louisiana].  It's, it's still there; I think it's still operating, and it, it has room for about thirty girls, I think--thirty young girls who unfortun- have the unfortunate circumstance of becoming pregnant while they're in high school.  We had a serious problem with, with abandoned houses being used as crack houses, so I instituted a program we call crack down on crack houses, and we would go out on Saturdays all day and we would just board up houses--abandoned houses in the city, and we did that for about two years.  That was a great program; we had, we had a lot of fun with that.  So, there were--it's just a number of things that we did over the years with the reserve deputy association; that was one of my, my proudest achievements.
Story_ID: 632017
Speaker 1: And your, your first office started in 1982 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen eighty-two [1982].
Speaker 1: And is this an office of every four years?  You have to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you run every four years citywide or parishwide, countywide.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was elected--what, seven times in a row?
Speaker 1: So there's no limit, no limit, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was no term limit on the office; I could still be there if I wanted to, but what I decided to do was--there was a call after Katrina [Hurricane Katrina]; there was a great call to reduce the size of government, and one of the things that stood out like a sore thumb was the fact that we had two sheriffs in New Orleans parish [Orleans Parish, Louisiana]--the only, the only parish in the state that had more than one sheriff, so I said, "You know, this is--you really can't justify this long term, so we need to do something about it," so I, I went to the legislature [Louisiana State Legislature] and got them to merge the two offices.  I helped elect a friend of mine--get elected to the other sheriff, and he eventually has taken over both offices.
Speaker 1: Were you tired of, of doing that, and wanted to do something different?
Speaker 2: I don't know if tired would be the word.  I was not as challenged anymore, and I could feel myself getting stale.  After doing it for twenty-eight years, you know, you get stale and, and I wanted to chan- I wanted a change.  I wouldn't say tired, 'cause I enjoyed right up to the end doing everything that I did as sheriff, but I just wanted a new challenge.  It wasn't a challenge anymore; I had solved all the problems that I could solve (laughter) in that position, and it wasn't, it wasn't a challenge anymore.  I wanted to do something else.
Speaker 1: When was your last term?  When did it end?
Speaker 2: Today is what, the 11th of June?  It ended one month and six days ago.
Story_ID: 632018
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about, about Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] that went on--during that time that had to be a trying time and challenging time.
Speaker 2: It was, it was.  Something deep in my gut told me that, that--and I had been through--I've lived here all my life, and I've been through every possible hurricane that we've had and I never, I never really had a sense that this--that that any of these other hurricanes were the potential for a catastrophe.  But Saturday morning before it hit, I woke up and something just deep down inside said, "You know, this is gonna be bad, and you better start telling all your friends to get out," and so--
Speaker 1: Let--let's pause for a second.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you want--
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Something told me that this was gonna be serious, and so I spent most of Saturday afternoon calling everybody I knew and telling em to get out of town.  I was on the--in, in my position as sheriff, I was on the city's emergency preparedness committee, and so I was going to the briefings, and I just had this deep feeling that this was going to be a really bad situation, and so I, I, I called everybody I could get ahold of and told 'em to get out of town.  And so Sunday night--something else I did that I had never done before is I took all the pictures off the walls in my downstairs, moved 'em upstairs, rolled up the carpets, the, the rugs and everything--dragged them upstairs, moved as much of the furniture as I could upstairs by myself, and so then I went to the office and settled in.  I had a meeting with my staff on Sunday morning; I told them where, where they were gonna be working and what they were gonna be doing.  We had, we had a hurricane threat in 1995, I think it was, where the mayor ordered some of the public schools to be opened as shelters, and they asked us because the, the Red Cross [American Red Cross] has abandoned us; they, they don't come into New Orleans [Louisiana] until after an event has happened.  So, the mayor asked me if I would have my deputies man the shelters, hurricane shelters, in 1995.  And what that experience taught me was that at that point in time, I thought there would be about a hundred thou- fortunately, nothing ever happened; we, we opened the, the shelters for one night, and then sent everybody home the next day because the hurricane turned and went to the, to the east, I think.  But what that experience taught me was that there would probably be about a hundred thousand people that would not be able to get outta the city if a real hurricane--and I remember, I wrote a memorandum to the head of the National Guard.  I don't know if he ever got it, I never heard a communication from him about it, but it's, it's--detailing my experiences because I, I could see that there were serious problems.  I remember on instance at Southern University [Southern University at New Orleans] in New Orleans, which was one of the shelters, somebody rolled in a person who was on a respirator--just rolled the bed--rol- came up in a van, rolled the bed out of the van with the person in it, rolled it into the lobby of, of Southern University, found a plug, plugged it in, and left.  And there were no--there was no medical staff there; there was nothing.  Two of the other shelters--fights broke out, and we had to put people out of the shelter.  In about three or four instances, there were people who had some kind of psychosis and had to be taken away.  And so I, I just knew that that was not something I ever wanted to do again with my staff because I could see that there was a potential for that to become overwhelming, and so I communicated that to the people I had above me, but I don't know that anything ever happened from it.

Speaker 1: So here comes Katrina [Hurricane Katrina].  And so after I--Sunday, after I meet with my people and tell 'em where they're gonna be, I tell 'em to go home and get their families out of town, and then tell 'em to come back with a couple a days' clothes, change of clothes, and report back at a--I think it was three o'clock, or something like that, so we dispersed 'em to their locations; ten of 'em were at the Superdome [Louisiana Superdome; Mercedes-Benz Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana], a couple of 'em were at the Municipal Auditorium [New Orleans, Louisiana]; nobody was at the, the convention center [New Orleans Convention Center; New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, New Orleans, Louisiana]. And a few other public buildings in town we had people at.  And so I settled down to see what was gonna happen, and overnight wasn't, wasn't a whole lot going on; it was a little wind, a little rain, but not a whole lot.  The next morning sunrise came--it was still raining.  We had a really bad blow of wind maybe two hours before sunrise, and I could hear glass breaking, so I figured there was stuff being tossed around and thrown around, and when sunrise came, it was a little, little bit more damage than you would normally see under a hurricane, and we had lost electricity, but we expected that to happen. Excuse me.  About midday--the rain stopped on Monday, and so I, I took one of my vehicles and, and a couple a deputies and said, "Let's go out and look around."  So we first went uptown and there were a lot of trees down.  St. Charles Avenue was non-negotiable; you couldn't drive up it.  And--we didn't see any water, though, and so then we came back to the office and we, we hung around the office for a couple hours and then we decided to go and check the downtown area of the city.  As we're driving out, we reach St. Bernard Avenue and I looked over--we were on the interstate; I looked over and, and I could see there was water in the street.  I said, "Gosh, there's water in the street."  So we stopped and looked, and so we kept going and as we went further out, we could see that the water was rising.  This was now about four o'clock in the evening on Monday.  We got to the Franklin Avenue up ramp, and we couldn't go any further because it--the interstate goes down to ground level, and that entire area was flooded; there was about twelve feet of water there, so we stopped and we--stopped the car and we got out to look, and when we got out to look, I could hear people hollering, "Help me!  Help me!  Come get me!"  I said, "Boy, something's going on."  So, we were by an up ramp, and I started walking down the up ramp and I saw two guys who are now policemen, who used to work for me in the sheriff's office and they had a boat, and they saw us and they said, "Aw, man, are we glad to see y'all!  Help us!  We, we gotta go get--there's people all over the place; we gotta get outta here!"  So we started doing search and rescue, and I called for my other deputies to bring the other vans because we were transporting people as soon as we got 'em out their houses--transporting them down to the dome.  So, we did that all night--all afternoon, until ten o'clock Monday night, and it was just too dark; we were running into automobiles.  You couldn't see; the water was above the roofs of automobiles, so you couldn't see the cars, and there were still people hollering and screaming, begging for somebody to come and get 'em.  So we quit about ten o'clock on Monday night. And Tuesday morning, the mayor [Ray Nagin] called a meeting.  And I was walking over to my car to drive to the meeting, and I don't know why I was taking my car 'cause the meeting was just across the street.  So, I got to the parking lot and the water started coming into the parking lot--parking garage--city hall parking garage, and it was about ankle deep.  I went upstairs to my car and, and I heard some--when I was starting up my car, I hear some people hollering, I went back, back downstairs, and water had gotten to my knees (laughter), so I couldn't go anywhere in a car, so we stopped at that point.
Story_ID: 632020
Speaker 1: We stopped at that point and, and we then decided to walk over to the meeting.  We put on some boots and we walked over to the meeting and the mayor [Ray Nagin] never showed up because he was in--he, he was in a helicopter touring the city.  We didn't know what--where the water was coming from--we had no idea; we just knew that there was water rising in the streets and we didn't know how much, how much it was gonna rise or how long it was gonna rise or anything.  There was no communication at all.  If you could not, if you could not see the person, you couldn't talk to 'em.  And there were rumors rampant all over the place. You didn't know what to believe or not.  So, Tuesday morning, we went back out and we were moving people all day Tuesday from the area where we had been Monday night, bringing 'em in--rescuing 'em and bringing 'em, and we did that until it was, again, too dark to work.  Wednesday morning I got a call from the state sheriff's association [Louisiana Sheriff's Association] that my counterpart who ran the jail, that he was stuck in a jail with a, a large number of prisoners that needed to be evacuated, and the state department of corrections [Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections] was bringing buses in to evacuate 'em, but they didn't know how to get in and could I help 'em go out and get 'em in, and so I did, and we brought 'em in and they eventually got the prisoners out.  But even though I had been riding up and down the Claiborne interstate--the I-10 [Interstate 10] over Claiborne Avenue, I guess I didn't, I didn't get the picture of the mass of humanity until I was up on that--the overpass that crosses over the, the interstate--the I-10 by the Superdome [Louisiana Superdome; Mercedes-Benz Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana].  And I stopped and got out of the car and I looked out, and I just saw this mass of humanity on both sides of the, of the I-10 high rise going down Claiborne Avenue, and it was just the saddest sight that I've ever seen; it made me cry--it was, it was just that bad.  And about five minutes after that, here comes this brand new Explorer [Ford Explorer] with, with five youngsters in it.  When I say youngsters, I mean in their early twenties.  And they rolled down the window and they asked me where some hotel was, and they were FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency] workers and they were having a good time; they were laughing and joking and they had--oh, I don't know--cold drinks.  They may have had beer, I, I don't remember what they had; it was just a sight that was really offensive to me at the moment because here I was, I was three days into the storm [Hurricane Katrina], I hadn't had a bath, hadn't had a shower, hadn't shaved, hadn't changed clothes (laughter), and was stinking of, of that, that nasty water that I was jumping in and out of, and here these three kids in starched, stiff white shirts, you know, and asking me where the FEMA office was, and I, I just pointed 'em across the river and I just shook my head.  It was such a--such--the, the, the, the difference between those two sights was just so dramatic and, and compelling, and it was, it was just--I, I guess when I saw that sight on, on the Claiborne overpass, I lost all faith in the United States government to protect its own people.  And then later that day, I happened to see the sights at the convention center [New Orleans Convention Center; New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, New Orleans, Louisiana].  I drove past the convention center; I forgot where I was on my way to, but I drove past the convention center and I saw those people out there and I was just really, really, just torn up by the whole thing. We continued to do search and rescue Thursday and Friday.
Story_ID: 632021
Speaker 1: One of the stories that I tell people that happened to me is--I think it was late--mid, mid-afternoon on--no, it was Tuesday morning, Tuesday morning.  I see this--I went out the front of the courthouse and onto Poydras Street, and I see this woman and she's dragging a--what looks like a piece, a piece of plywood; there's water in the street, so it's floating, and she's walking.  It's about--the water's about that deep (gesture)--about halfway up your calf.  And she's got this pile a clothes on top of it and so I see her and I start to walk towards her and she start--the median was high and dry so she starts to walk towards the median, and I could see she was having trouble, so I helped her pull a piece of wood up on the--onto the median, and I realized it was a door, so she says, "Mister, can you help me?"  I said, "What's your--yeah, what's your problem?"  So she said, "Well, I need to bury my husband."  I said, "You need to bury your husband?"  She said, "Yeah."  She said, "He, he died while, while the storm was going on, and I don't want him in the house for my children to see, and so I need to take him somewhere to get buried."  I said, "Well, where is he?"  She says, "Right there."  I said, "Oh, you mean that stack of clothes?"  "Yeah," she said, "I covered him."  And so I said, "Okay, well, let me see what I can do."  So I went upstairs to city hall, which was now being manned by the National Guard, and I went to the colonel in charge and I said, "Colonel, there's a woman downstairs who's got a body, and we need to do something with it."  He looks at me and he says, "Well, what do you want me to do?"  I said, "Well, don't y'all have body bags or anything?"  He says, "We're in search and rescue, we're not in recovery yet."  I said, "What does that mean?"  He says, "We're in search and rescue, we're not in recovery yet."  I said, "I don't understand your terminology."  He said, "That means we don't have a morgue, we don't have body bags, we don't have anything."  I said, "Okay, I'll tell you what.  If you give me the body bag and a pair a gloves, I'll go and help the woman."  He said, "Sheriff, you don't understand me; I don't have any body bags."  I said, "How could you come here and not have body bags?"  So, I went back downstairs and I told the woman, I said, "I'm sorry, ma'am, but there's nothing I can do."  I said, "All I can tell you is that Charity Hospital [New Orleans, Louisiana] is two blocks away, but," I said, "I haven't even been around there 'cause the water's too deep.  I don't know if there's anybody even there."  So, I helped her refloat her--while I was gone, cameramen came around and took pictures of her and that was one of the pictures that you saw in all of the little newspapers and magazines that were out at that time.  And there was nothing--you couldn't do anything.
Speaker 2: When did you realize that, that the levies had broken and this is what the problem was?
Speaker 1: Not until Friday, not until Friday because we were on the ground here; we, we had no communication.  We didn't know what was going on; we just knew there was water in the street.  We knew it was coming from somewhere.  We thought--I--the way--at the beginning, the way it was coming up so fast, I thought that the Mississippi River levy had broken somewhere, and--but then the water was coming from the opposite direction; it wasn't coming from the river, it was coming from this way (gesture).  This--it was coming towards the river.  So I had no idea; I thought, well, maybe the--maybe the, the, the lake levies have overflowed. But it wasn't until Friday that we found out.  Another thing happened--I, I was going once a day just to check on my house in the neighborhood where I lived and which was high and dry, and the first day I went, there was a, a dead woman laying in the middle of the street.  Now, there wasn't any floodwater here; she was just laying in the middle of the street and nobody was there.  So--this was on Magazine [Street] and, and Jackson Avenue, and I just drove around her and I watched that body decay--five days, I drove by, and I watched, I watched her swell up, I watched her turn purple, I watched the body explode--the skin just explode, I watched the things coming--eating.  Finally, we were able to get somebody to come and put--drag her to the curb and put some sand over her and. But those were the kind of things that you, that you experienced; it wasn't, it wasn't nice.  I have a picture in my house of one rescue mission that went on and we had a guy who came in and he was a photographer, and he rode with us and took some pictures and we rode past a couple of dead bodies, and we were rescuing people, and it looked like we were rescuing 'em off their porch.  It was their porch, all right, the second floor porch (laughter).
Story_ID: 632022
Speaker 1: It--Katrina [Hurricane Katrina], Katrina let me know a number of things.  First of all, it let me know (laughter) that I wasn't as young as I used to be.  I had aches and pains for a while after that.  It also let me know that while America may have been able to do a lot for a lot of people in the world, it just didn't have the capacity to deal with its own people and deal with tragedies that take place here in the United States.  And I think today, as we sit here today, America is still unprepared to deal with national catastrophes, and that is a fear that I, that I still maintain.  I had nightmares for a long time about water (laughter)--you can imagine.  And I guess we went for about ten to twelve days without a, a bath, a shower, a shave or clean clothes.  At one point, I had some female deputies who stuck with us, and at one point I sent one of my guys--'cause we found a, a road to get out of town, so I sent one of my guys to Baton Rouge [Louisiana] to buy them some clothes, and I bought them some clothes and, and--but the aftermath was probably as bad as the--as what happened because what you had is--it would be like if I said to you today--right now, if I said, "You have to live the rest of your life with exactly what you have right now," and you've lost everything that you've had in your entire life, and having to rebuild an office with people who are coming--I mean people couldn't even identify themselves, you know, 'cause you didn't have your driver's license anymore.  You didn't have, you know, any kind of identification--you didn't have a birth certificate, you didn't have anything.  Not to mention any of the accoutrements of, of your lifestyle, you know, your, your favorite chair or your, your TV set, or anything like--you have nothing, you know, you have nothing.  And to have to rebuild an office after that was, was really, really a strain, and really tough.  But we did it--it worked.
Speaker 2: How do you feel about the mayor [Ray Nagin] and how he performed during that time?
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: That's fair.
Speaker 1: I don't know because even though I was here, I don't know what to believe and not believe about him.  I know that the media had a vendetta out for him and, you know, there were people who were saying he wasn't here.  I don't know if he was here or not--I don't know.  I know a lot of public officials were up in Baton Rouge enjoying the luxury of, of air conditioned hotel rooms and, and three meals a day.  We were eating MREs [meal, ready to eat] and sleeping on the floor in the courthouse, but of course that's what I bought in for; I was the sheriff and that was my responsibility, so--I don't begrudge them for doing that, but the aftermath of the storm, I have some definite opinions about the mayor.  I think that, I think that he discovered his, his blackness after the storm, and I think, however, he abused it, and I don't think that he--I don't know who, who was advising him, and I think that he made some bad decisions after the storm, which we are paying for.
Story_ID: 632023
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What would you have changed if you could change anything during that time?
Speaker 2: I would have issued the order for evacuation on Friday or Saturday.  Issuing the order on Sunday was just too late.  And I would have attempted to get people out of town; I'd have made a better effort at getting people out of town.  I don't have any special skills at weather reporting, but I could look at that storm and see what the weather bureau was saying, and I could see that this is gonna--if it's not gonna be a dead hit, it's gonna be very close.  And there's a potential for a lot of damage to happen.  I never expected it from the, from the canals; I expected the lake [Lake Pontchartrain] to overflow, or the Mississippi River to have a problem, but never expected--I never even thought about the canals, but that's where it happened.  So, I think that would be the first thing I would, I would have done is, is gotten a lot of people out of town a lot faster, and that probably could have saved a, a number of problems.  But you still would have had that base population of maybe a hundred thousand people that would not have gone anywhere simply because they were incapable, for a variety of reasons.  And I don't know what you do with that population; I don't know, I don't--the city [New Orleans, Louisiana] didn't have the capacity to move 'em.  Now, we have had one hurricane since then where we did have a plan in place, and we did move those people out of town successfully and bring 'em back.  But without having had the experience of Katrina [Hurricane Katrina], and without having had the time to develop a plan, there just wasn't a plan and, and it wasn't, wasn't one--you know, you just didn't--you didn't know what was gonna happen.
Speaker 1: Would you ever run for mayor?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I've been asked a number of times; it's not something I ever want to do, or wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Is there something that we did not talk about that you wanna talk about before we go on?
Speaker 2: No, I think so--I don't think so; I think we've covered the waterfront pretty good.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and back in your career--is there anything that we didn't talk about that you would like to talk about?
Speaker 2: Probably some things (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Probably, but can you think of anything that you--that we can go back to talk about that we might have missed?
Speaker 2: No, I think--I'll probably think of a dozen things in another day or two--
Speaker 1: Of course.
Speaker 2: --but.
Story_ID: 632024
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about when you got married.  Tell me who you--how you met your wife, and who she is, and--you, you have children?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I have two daughters (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: I--my first marriage was in 1974.  I met this young lady through my sister [Eileen Valteau Bernard], and we dated for about two years and then we got married and had a couple a children, and we kind of grew apart.  We didn't see eye to eye on, on a lot of things. We, we were from different generations essentially.  She was about six years younger than me, and she, she, she didn't have the, the desire to achieve and the motivation to be a, a A personality like I did, and so it just didn't, didn't work out.  But I spent a lot of time raising my children. They've lived with me much of the--much of their formative years, and I was actively involved in their lives and they were actively involved in mine (laughter).  They came to a lot of the activities and functions that I was involved in, and I think they--their lives were enriched by it, and I hope that they have a--and I think that they do have a commitment to community involvement.  My oldest daughter, I know, is mentoring a young woman in, in Atlanta [Georgia].  My youngest daughter does a lot of volunteer work with agencies in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: What are their names?
Speaker 2: Michelle [Michelle Valteau] and Collette [Collette Valteau].
Speaker 1: And what do they do?
Speaker 2: Michelle is a lawyer in Atlanta and Collette is a businesswoman with The Conference Board in New York City.  Collette teaches as a voluntary duty on, on weekends; she tutors kids.  So I know they both have the, the volunteerism in 'em that was instilled in me by my parents [Udine Davis Valteau and Paul R. Valteau, Sr.] and I instilled in them with all of the volunteer work that I had them doing.
Story_ID: 632025
Speaker 1: I did forget to tell you one thing, that during the, during the course of all this stuff I, I started a business and, and the business grew into the largest minority owned business in the air- operating in airports for, for a time; it isn't anymore, but it was at, at one point the largest minority operated business in airports.  It's called, The Grove [The Grove, Inc.]--sells the dried fruit and nuts in airports--the little stands.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I'm fairly proud of that endeavor as well.
Story_ID: 632026
Speaker 1: I met my second wife--actually, we met when I was in law school [Loyola University New Orleans College of Law, New Orleans, Louisiana] and she--at--was raised here in New Orleans [Louisiana] and had just gone to work for IBM [International Business Machines Corporation], and we met and we dated for a short period of time and then she left town, got married and moved to Houston [Texas], and we met up again about ten or fifteen years ago, I think it was, and started seeing each other and realized that there was a, a great relationship there, and so we grew it and got married three years ago, and it's great fun; I'm enjoying it.
Speaker 2: What is her name?
Speaker 1: Paula [Paula Saizan]. And it's, it's a, a stabilizing force in my life for sure.  She's a great woman and I appreciate having her in my life.
Story_ID: 632027
Speaker 1: If you look back over your life, is there something that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Not really.  I think, I think I've had a, a really fun life. Done a lot of things, I've experienced a lot of things, I've met a lot of people, I've enjoyed a lot of, a lot of success, so I don't think I would change much.
Speaker 1: Is there something that you have not done that you would like to do?
Speaker 2: Probably is, but I, I, I couldn't articulate it right now; I just don't--I don't know it (laughter), but I, I'm sort of like a restless soul in that I want to continue to achieve and do things.  I think there's a, there's a, a, a lot in New Orleans [Louisiana] that I'd like to see different, that I'd like to see change.  I don't know if I have the capacity to do it; that's part of why I didn't run for mayor, because I, I'm not real optimistic about New Orleans right now. And some of that may be because of my fifty year--fifty, sixty something year history here in New Orleans and knowing the personalities and the people and the, the kind of things that are going on here.
Story_ID: 632028
Speaker 1: What about what you do here at this law firm?  Tell me the name of this law firm again?
Speaker 2: Valteau, Harris, Koenig and Mayer [New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: And what type of cases are you handling here (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Civil, civil, civil cases.  Basically I'm, I'm just doing major litigation.
Speaker 1: Any interesting cases?
Speaker 2: Well, I've only been doing it for a week and a half, so (laughter)--I'm sorry, a month, a month and a week, so it's, it's still early in the process.  We have signed up a couple of the BP [BP P.L.C.] oil cases, and I'm very concerned about that, as we all are.  It's a, a major catastrophe.
Speaker 1: So, these are, are people who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) People who are injured as a result of--fishermen who are out of work as a result of the BP oil rig explosion--yeah.
Speaker 1: What do you--what are your thoughts?  I know everybody's concerned, but what are your thoughts about it?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that once again, America is showing that we, we don't--we aren't prepared.  We, we, we gave this company authority to drill this deep well rig, obviously without the proper checks and balances in place, without reviewing the necessary safety measures that needed to be in place, so the consequence of that is what we have, and I'm irritated by the fact that this is a company that has a track record of disasters from Alaska to the Gulf Coast over the last five years.  I'm irritated by the fact that it's a foreign company that wouldn't do what it's doing in, in the Gulf anywhere near England because England wouldn't allow 'em, but they come to our land and mess it up, and then walk away.  So there's a lot that I'm irritated about with--and I'm irritated about the fact that we're going to have literally thousands of people who will be out of work for some time to come, and I'm irritated about the effects that that will have upon this community, both as a community and the individuals who live in the community--how it's going to affect the lifestyle of this community.  All of those things are, are things that concern me about this oil spill that haven't really been dealt with yet.  I'm concerned about what effects--what long term effects it's gonna have on the Louisiana state budget and the finances of our state, which depends heavily on, on both oil and gas, and the fisheries.

Speaker 1: If you had to send a message to the future generations, whether it's about going to law school or being in politics, or just education period, what message would you like to send to the future generations?
Speaker 2: I think that the key to the success of any future generation is education.  It's been said a million times in a million different ways, but if you don't know where you been, there's no way you gonna know where you're going.  And in order to know where you been, you have to have education--you gotta be educated.  If you're going to be successful doing anything, you gotta have education.  If you're gonna be a successful prisoner in jail, you gotta know how to read and write (laughter), so that's the message--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) that education is the key to everything.

Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Wow (laughter).  That I served my community well, that I did a good job, that I was a, a role model for someone, and that I accomplished all of the goals that I set out to accomplish in public life.
Speaker 1: And before we wind up--wound up (laughter), is there anything else that you'd like to talk about?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay, I just wanna make sure that we didn't miss anything that you wanted to talk about (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Well, I'd like to thank you for taking the time out of your schedule to share your story because it's very important that we hear all the stories that we can- can of people who have led the way for the future generations, and we appreciate you.

Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, I wanna know how that even came about.
Speaker 2: I think it was the summer of my sophomore year.  Well, let me change that.  My parents [Udine Davis Valteau and Paul R. Valteau, Sr.] were very, very interested in the Civil Rights Movement at, at its beginning in the early 1960s and late '50s [1950s], and I paid attention to what was going on because of their influence.  The opportunity came about to be actively involved the summer of my sophomore year.  The, the priests at our school were very actively involved in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and the Urban League [National Urban League], and both organizations were involved in activities relating to the civil rights activities of the day, and an opportunity came about for us to do voter registration, picketing, and protesting in the summer of my sophomore year.
Speaker 1: Now, what year is this?  Is this 1962 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think '62 [1962], I think, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, you said '62 [1962].
Speaker 2: And the--so I, I took a, a--I went to an organization called, the Greater New Orleans coordinating council [Coordinating Council of Greater New Orleans], which was an, an organization formed of an amalgamation of all of the civil rights organizations to organize young people to participate in these activities. And so I went to the organization that summer and started out doing voter registration the entire summer.  They, they put us together in teams; it was a team of about six people, and we were given an area of the city, and we went into that area and knocked on doors and, and invited people to let us teach them how to register to vote, and then we arranged for a particular day at the end of the week for them to be picked up in a bus and brought down to city hall, and attempts were made to register.  As was the custom in that time, it probably took several attempts before people actually got registered.  And so that's where I started, and I can remember watching--we are approaching the anniversary of the I Have a Dream speech, and I remember watching the I Have a Dream speech and the March on Washington in the living room of a lady in a housing development who I was teaching how to fill out the application to register to vote, and so it's fond memories of that time.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me what discussions were occurring around your, your parents' ta- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Kitchen table (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the discussions were about what America was gonna be like and how changes would take place in New Orleans [Louisiana] in particular, and when and where these changes were going to take place, as well as discussions about what my parents had experienced as they were developing.  I, I specifically remember that my father always told a story of how he had to go to the registrar's office about five times before he eventually could get registered and the, the, the thing--the device that was used to, to prevent African American voters, or potential voters, from registering was that after you filled out the application, assuming you got that all right, they would then give you the Preamble to the [U.S.] Constitution to read, and tell you to interpret it, and regardless of how you interpret it, you were always wrong until they realized that your persistence was not going to keep you from coming  back and attempting to register, and finally they would allow you to register.  And he would talk about all the, all the things they told him at the various times he went down to register to vote, and how finally he got to be registered and, and how important it was.  Both my parents talked about how important it was to participate, to be registered, and to be active.
Story_ID: 632033
Speaker 1: When you went that day for the--you know, to get involved with the student coordinating council [Coordinating Council of Greater New Orleans], do you remember that day and, and what was actually sort of--you know, who was in charge that day (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A Mr. Plummer [ph.] was in charge.  We went into a large room and, and he--in about a, a period of an hour or so, told us what we were gonna be doing, and then they put us through the training on how to fill out the form and how to encourage people to, to participate in, in the effort to register, and that it was important not just to teach people how to register, but to also make sure that they showed up for the bus on Friday that was taking everybody down to city hall to try to get registered because it was only part of the process if you taught those people how, how to register and they didn't show up.  And I said then, and I'll say now, that to me, the real heroes of, of that movement were the people who did come down on Friday, who got on that bus, who went down to city hall and did attempt to register because many of those people were, were employed by--in the white community and by the white community, and faced retribution from the white community in some instances when they registered to vote, and so tho- those were the true heroes, I thought--the people--'cause I was a teenager, I had nothing on the line in terms of, of losing something because I, because I registered to vote--not that I could at the time, but I admire those people, and I've always thought very fondly of those people over the years because their efforts made it possible for all the things that we have today in, in this great nation that we live in.
Speaker 1: So, that registration drive--did you have a sense that you were part of a nationwide drive?  You know these coordinating councils--was there a sense at that age of, of--
Speaker 2: I, I think we had a sense that, that we were part of something in the New Orleans [Louisiana] area, but at the time we were, we were youths, and it, it was fun for us, to be quite honest.  I enjoyed being with six to ten people who were my age at different schools in the City of New Orleans, and when we weren't registering, or attempting to register people to vote, we were, we were spending a lot of time talking about activities at our various schools and, and talking about looking forward to the next year of study and, and the plans we had, and the things we wanted to do.  I think in a, in a larger sense, probably back there in our minds we, we understood that we were hopefully making a change to our nation that ultimately was going to inure to our benefit, but whether or not it was right at the forefront of our minds at the time, I don't think so; I think we were just enjoying the activities.  We often had meetings where we would sing some of the old Negro spirituals and, and get ourselves riled, particularly when we were going to do picketing in front of some of the, the major department stores and restaurants that wouldn't--and hotels--that wouldn't allow African Americans in.  Those were enjoyable times--it was fun; we had a good time.
Speaker 1: So, how, how--over what period of time are you involved in your sophomore year [at St. Augustine High School, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: The entire summer, and then we had some specific--into the fall, we had some specific days--afternoons, that we had specific marches or specific protests that we were called to, to come to and participate.  I, I particularly remember one where probably three hundred of us showed up in front of city hall to protest the, the registrar of voters at the time, whose name was A.P. "Tim" Gallinghouse. And we had a cheer that, that we just stood out there and just made all the noise we could, and created as much of a disruption as we possibly could to the point that they, they brought out the paddy wagons and took us all to jail that, that day--that afternoon.  It was after school, and so--into the--and that was in the fall, and so there would be various days where we would decide to protest en masse in particular locations.  Mostly, it was around city hall because at the time, city hall not only just had a big problem with registering African Americans, it also had a cafeteria, and the cafeteria didn't allow African Americans to eat in the cafeteria, and a number of the city agencies were segregated.
Story_ID: 632034
Speaker 1: I can remember in that time, New Orleans [Louisiana] was attempting to become a major league sports city, and there was a, a group of white men who were appealing to the national sports organizations to bring national games to New Orleans, particularly the NFL [National Football League], and before the NFL would bring any games, they told these people that they would not allow games to come to New Orleans if they sold tickets on a segregated basis.  Tulane Stadium [New Orleans, Louisiana] was segregated up until about 1965 in its seating.  There was a, a section for colored people, and then the entire rest of the stadium was for whites.  I remember one particular instance which was the first time I came across the name of Ernest N. Dutch Morial [Ernest Morial].  The American Football League, the AFL, decided to give New Orleans a chance, and so they scheduled their all-star game to be played in New Orleans in, I think, January of 1963.  Well, the players came to town and the black players landed at the airport, and the white taxi drivers would not give them a ride to town, and black taxi drivers were not allowed at the airport, so the black football players were stuck at the airport.  It was a huge embarrassment for the City of New Orleans, and the AFL immediately pulled out of the City of New Orleans and moved their game to Houston, Texas that year.  It was shortly after that, that, that the, the fathers--the city fathers realized that there would have to be major and significant change if they were gonna be a player on the national scene in terms of national sports activities.  And I think that--particularly, particularly in New Orleans, sporting events was a ca- were a catalyst to--
Speaker 2: Can you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) integration.
Story_ID: 632035
Speaker 1: So who was mayor at the time?  And what was the, the political structure to the extent that you knew it?
Speaker 2: The mayor was Victor H. Schiro at the time.  The political structure was that the--New Orleans [Louisiana] was organized around a number of white political organizations, and the African American vote had not become large enough to be significant.  It wasn't until about 1970--'69 [1969] or '70 [1970] that the African American vote began to emerge as a force in the electoral process.
Speaker 1: And is that a direct result of the voter registration drives (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think absolutely it is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Do you know any of the numbers between the time that you may have done it as, you know, participating in those drives as a teenager?
Speaker 2: It would merely be a guestimate on my part at this point.  Those numbers could be obtained, but I would think that the African American vote comprised less than 20 percent of the total vote.  Prior to the 1960s, as a result of the civil rights activities of the 1960s when we approached 1970, I would think that we were probably somewhere around 30 to 35 percent of the, the vote, and beginning to express some political power in the form of our vote. And, and white candidates were beginning to approach the black community and black political leaders or black--I shouldn't say political leaders, just leaders--and talk with them about how to get that black vote, and beginning to make commitments to the black community.  The 1969 mayoral campaign was a pivotal campaign because it was in that campaign that a young fellow name Moon Landrieu who is--whose son [Mitch Landrieu] is now the mayor, was the first candidate of, of--from the other side, from the white community, to make specific commitments to the black community, and the first commitment he made was that there would be blacks employed in city government, and that was a, a--sort of a watershed event because it, it started to open the doors for black participation as well as black employment in local government.
Speaker 1: Okay. I wanna ask you--so that, that sort of (unclear) me.  I-there're a couple of questions I wanna sort of just establish some things.  So what is the role of parishes in the whole political structure?  Can I understand that?
Speaker 2: Parishes are like counties here.  In Louisiana, we have sixty-four parishes.  Orleans Parish [Louisiana] is contiguous with the boundaries of the City of New Orleans, so it is one in the same, and it--it is just the way the state is divided up, and because of our, our French history they're called parishes rather than counties.
Story_ID: 632036
Speaker 1: Now, when you--so, in high s- in college when you were at Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana], did you still continue to be active politically, or--and--well--
Speaker 2: No, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's (unclear).  I--and then I was wondering why you chose to, you know, major in sociology. Did that have any--I mean did--had you decided you wanted to go to law school at that point?
Speaker 2: No, no.  At Dillard I, I became active in, in a lot of on campus stuff as well as some of the local--I continued my activity in, in organizations such as the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and, and some of the other organizations.  However, the, the movement was no longer an active on the street picketing movement because of the public accommodations bill that was passed in the mid-'60s [Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title II], which opened most things up.  It became then a--more of a situation where lawyers were litigating very particular issues that related to school desegregation and, and busing issues, and that kind of stuff or, or individual situations where people or organizations were denying the civil rights to their employees, and that kind of stuff.  But at Dillard I, I got involved in, in campus activities and continued my activism in that form; it wasn't until actually my senior year.  I majored in sociology, I guess, more out of the interest that I had from my interactions with people through the Civil Rights Movement.  I just--I just felt like that seemed to be a natural focus for me, and I, I--in my studies I did very well in that area, and it was an area that I had an interest in.  Along about my senior year in, in college, I had a political science--I took a political science course, and political science professor suggested to me that I consider law school, and it was at that point that I decided maybe to take a look at it 'cause I didn't know any lawyers at that time.  I had no lawyers in my family, there was no background in the legal system in my family, so I didn't know anything about it, and there were two kinds of people that came on campus to interview.  There was businesses that came on campus to talk to people about going to work for them, and then there were universities--graduate schools that came on campus to talk to students about going to their graduate school. And I took--I did do a few interviews with businesses, a couple of interviews with governmental agencies, and I wasn't excited about any of it and I went to one--after this professor suggested that I considered law school, I went to an interview for a, a law school with a, a person who came on campus, and that peeked my interest and I, I started to think seriously about it and, and I went out and took the LSAT, which was the Law School Admissions Test, and did well on it, and I said, "Well, maybe this is a field that I should consider," and, and did.
Speaker 1: So there was no time between Dillard and, and getting accepted to Loyola [Loyola University New Orleans College of Law, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I went, I went (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You went directly there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 632037
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, I, I wanna understand also what is the, the college age Paul Valteau [HistoryMaker Paul R. Valteau, Jr.], what is he like?  You know, what is--what are his interests, who are his friends?  You know--how does Dillard shape you?
Speaker 2: I think I was someone who was very interested in, in the issues of the day.  One of my favorite pastimes was I couldn't wait to get to school on Monday morning so I could go to the library and grab the Sunday version of The New York Times, and read it from cover to cover.  I was more interested in the, in the world at large and the issues on the, on the larger scene.  I became exposed to those kind of things at Dillard University [New Orleans, Louisiana], I met a much wider variety of people than had been in my life prior to that time; they were people from outside of New Orleans [Louisiana] who went to Dillard.  Dillard was made up mostly of people from outside of New Orleans, so I got to meet a lot of people from the South, mainly.  There were a few people from the Chicago [Illinois] area; there were people from Houston [Texas], there were people from Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia--so there were people from around the South and, and I think it opened up my, my impressions of, of the country, my impressions of what the world was like, and it, it broadened my perspective as well as the, the faculty helped broaden my perspective.  A number of the courses I took related to things like--that were, that were a much broader scope.  There were a couple a history courses I, I took that were much broader in scope, I took a couple of courses that dealt with Eastern religions just to see what they were all about, and that, that broadened my, my scope.  And so I, I used my undergraduate career as an opportunity to sort of absorb as much as I could about the world, and to learn more about it and understand it a little better.
Speaker 1: And who were some of your classmates that we might know, or people who were at Dillard at the time?
Speaker 2: There, there aren't any really, really outstanding that, that would be known or recognized nationally (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.  Now, the president at the time was?
Speaker 2: Albert Dent [Albert W. Dent] was the president at the time.
Speaker 1: The faculty, was it black and white, or--that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, it was black and white, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Dan Thompson [Daniel C. Thompson], who was a noted sociologist, was the head of the sociology department, and here again, that might be another one--it probably is one--another one of the reasons why I selected the sociology department because he was a nationally recognized individual, had written a number of books, and he was probably the strongest faculty member at the time in terms of national recognition.  And I thought that there was something that could be learned there, and so I, I did major in sociology, anticipating that I would spend a career in doing very similar to what Dan Thompson had done, but I, I became a little restless, I think, and realized that I didn't wanna spend the rest of my life on a college campus doing research and writing; I wanted to be more active.  I--my past had indicated that, that I was a person who was more active, and that's what I wanted to do.
Story_ID: 632038
Speaker 1: So, when you--how did you decide to apply to Loyola [Loyola University New Orleans College of Law, New Orleans, Louisiana]?  How was that decision?  And then you--
Speaker 2: I applied to a number of law schools.  The, the approach at that time was to go to as many--to apply to as many law schools as, as you could apply to, and I think I applied to about seven or eight law schools.  I got accepted to, I think, all of 'em.  I applied to LSU [Louisiana State University Law School; Paul M. Hebert Law Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], Tulane [Tulane University Law School, New Orleans, Louisiana], Loyola, Notre Dame [University of Notre Dame Law School, South Bend, Indiana], Northwestern [Northwestern University School of Law; Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law, Chicago, Illinois], Boston College [Boston College Law School, Newton Centre, Massachusetts], I think, and one others--I--one other one; I don't remember where it was.  I--the summer after I graduated, I came up to the University of Cincinnati [Cincinnati, Ohio] and went to a pre-law program and then stayed for a, a sem- almost an entire semester. And I, I met with the faculty on a continuing basis because every time an issue would be discussed in class, I knew enough to know that Louisiana law was a little different, and I would raise my hand and ask, "Is it this way in Louisiana?"  And the professors would say, "Well, let me talk with you about that after class."  And so after having enough of that, I finally said, "You know, maybe I ought to transfer back to Louisiana," and so I contacted the three law schools in Louisiana, and the, the selection of Loyola was a simple one--they offered me the full scholarship; the other two schools only offered a partial, so I said, "Heck, I'll just go back to Loyola; I can stay at home. It's cheap," (laughter), "and I got a full tuition, so I'll just go back there."  So I went back there.
Story_ID: 632039
Speaker 1: You were one of two African American students (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) African Americans, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --so who was other?
Speaker 2: Richard Stewart [Richard G. Stewart, Jr.] is his name; he was a classmate of mine in undergraduate school at Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana].  Richard and I were students at, at Loyola law school [Loyola University New Orleans College of Law, New Orleans, Louisiana], and we were the only African Americans in that class.  There was one other African American in the law school at the time, a fellow by the name of Edwin Lombard [HistoryMaker Edwin A. Lombard], and he was in his third year.  Richard and I both immediately saw that this was a major inequity and we, we set about to do something about that, so we contacted two organizations at the time--one was the Law Students Civil Rights Research Council, and the other one was BLSA, which is the Black Law Students Association [Black American Law Students Association; National Black Law Students Association], and talked with them about organizing chapters on both Loyola and Tulane's [Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana] campuses.  Unfortunately, racism raised its ugly head again and, of a class of about 135 students, two students got drafted into the [U.S.] military.  Richard was from Shreveport, Louisiana and his draft board was in Shreveport; I was from New Orleans [Louisiana] and my draft board was in New Orleans.  He and I were the only two students to get drafted out of the law school class.  As a result of that, Richard volunteer--in order to avoid going into the [U.S.] Army, Richard volunteered for the [U.S] Navy, and spent an entire career in the Navy and, and worked his way up to the post of commander, and retired as a commander.  Richard lives in the Dallas [Texas] area now.  I went to my physical and was selected to be in the [U.S.] Marine Corps, but because I have an ulnar nerve palsy which resulted from an accident that took place as a six year old child when I was refused treatment at a hospital, I was allowed to be exempt from military duty because I could not salute, and so I went back to law school and continued to--the work of attempting to get--to increase the number of African Americans in the law school.  That process started by me approaching the dean of the law school and suggested to--suggesting to him that we needed, we needed more African Americans in the law school, and fortunately it, it fell on receptive ears, and he said, "Sure, I'll be happy to help out.  What can I do?"  I said, "Well, we need to have a recruiting program."  And that's where it stopped.  He said, "Well, I don't know if we could do that; we don't have any money for that."  At the same time they were applying for a grant from the [U.S.] Department of Education to build a new law school, so I wrote a very lengthy letter to the Department of Education. Before I sent it I, I went to the dean and I presented it to him and I said, "I'm gonna send this letter unless we can talk about a, a program."  And he said, "Oh, let's talk."  So, not long after that, we began a, a, a recruiting program where, where I was given money to go out and visit college campuses throughout the State of Louisiana, and encourage young people to consider going to law school and consider going to Loyola law school.
Story_ID: 632040
Speaker 1: That effort for that entire y- first year yielded an, an admission of twenty-four students--African American students the next year into law school.  In that class was a federal judge--a young man who's a federal judge--[HistoryMaker] Ivan Lemelle who, I think, you've done a HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] piece on, as well as a fellow by the name of Louis Westerfield who, at one point, was the dean of Loyola's law school [Loyola University New Orleans College of Law, New Orleans, Louisiana], and twice the dean of Ole Miss law school [University of Mississippi School of Law, Oxford, Mississippi], and died as the dean of Ole Miss law school.  So I, I think that my efforts yielded great returns, both for the African American community as well for Loyola University.
Speaker 2: So this is all in your first year?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And you were a one man band?
Speaker 1: Yep, yep, um-hm.
Speaker 2: So, the third year student [HistoryMaker Edwin A. Lombard] did he--?
Speaker 1: He graduated and he went on and had a, a career in--he's still around; he had a career in law and then he, he ran for--he was the first African American to get elected to a citywide office in New Orleans [Louisiana]; he was the clerk of criminal court.  He is now an appeals court judge, and he has, has had an illustrious career.  And the, the recruitment program continued after my freshman year and probably, by the time I graduated, there were about thirty-five African American students in Loyola law school.  So I felt like we had done a, a significant function.  In addition to that, I was elected to the national board of directors of the Louisi- of the (laughter)--not Louisiana--of the law school--Law Students Civil Rights Research Council, and I formed the first chapter of BALSA [Black American Law Students Association; National Black Law Students Association], along with two students from Tulane [Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana].  We formed the first chapter of BALSA in--at that time, it was the two law schools.  I have since been recognized by the Loyola African American student association as the founder of the, of the organization, which was somewhat pleasurable to me.  I enjoyed the opportunity to be recognized for what had been done, and I certainly gave credit to my cohort at the time, who was Richard Stewart [Richard G. Stewart, Jr.] who, unfortunately, didn't, didn't continue--couldn't continue because of his commitment to the [U.S.] military.
Story_ID: 632041
Speaker 1: You know the first year of law school [Loyola University New Orleans College of Law, New Orleans, Louisiana] can be challenging in most cases, and then you're also the head of recruitment.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--and this is--BALSA [Black American Law Students Association; National Black Law Students Association], how--what--how large was BALSA at the time?
Speaker 2: Very, very small; it was very (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Like very small meaning how--
Speaker 2: Are you asking me on the national level?
Speaker 1: On the national level and the--
Speaker 2: They were not in a lot of law schools yet; they were, they were still getting footing in, in law schools.  They were in--at Howard [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], they were at Southern at Baton Rouge [Southern University Law School; Southern University Law Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana]; they were at mostly the black law schools, and there were a few of, of the non-black law schools that, that they were beginning to formulate chapters, and ours was one of the early ones.
Speaker 1: You know, you don't think of the numbers starting with ones and twos (laughter), you know, so you say, "It's one of me there and two at Tulane [Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana]," (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah (laughter), right, right.  And in terms of the time I spent, my grades did suffer.  I probably could have been law review, but I never, I never saw law review as an important situation for me because at the time, the law practice in New Orleans [Louisiana] was segregated, there weren't gonna be any opportunities for me at any major law firm, so I felt my time was better spent opening doors for other people to follow me.
Speaker 1: So how is a student, though, actually able to recruit at that point in time?  Is part of the administration really working with you?
Speaker 2: Well, what the administration did--I, I said earlier that they put up some money and, and basically what they said is that, "You have a car, you contact these universities, we'll pay you for your mileage, and if you have to stay overnight, we'll pay you for your hotel; just bring us the bills back."  And so I got on the road and, and I, I--first I went to the schools in New Orleans; I went to Xavier [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana] and Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana], and SUNO [Southern University at New Orleans, New Orleans, Louisiana], and then I went to Louisiana Lafayette [University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Lafayette, Louisiana], Louisiana Monroe [University of Louisiana at Monroe, Monroe, Louisiana], Louisiana Lake Charles; it's not--it's called McNeese State [McNeese State University] in Lake Charles [Louisiana].  And I visited those schools and, and bought their material and, and talked about going to law school.  I found that the--that the liberal arts departments in those schools were very receptive to somebody coming out and talking about going to a graduate school, so I had decent size audiences where--everywhere I went and, you know, made the contacts and, and provided 'em with information and made myself available to talk to people on an individual basis, and hopefully they, they would respond and in fact they did and, and we had a, a really good turnout the first year after that.
Speaker 1: So how did it become institutionalized?  Did those numbers go down by the time you were in third year (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They, they tailed off after I left--after I graduated, but then they, they started back up again and I haven't checked 'em lately, but I think that they're in the, in the fifties to sixties range now.
Speaker 1: So like a third of the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) a third, third of the class, which is good, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, of the class, yeah, um-hm.
Story_ID: 632042
Speaker 1: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, you talked also about, you know, the program at the University of Cincinnati [Cincinnati, Ohio].  Who ran that program, and was it--
Speaker 1: It was a program that was run by something called CLEO [Council on Legal Education Opportunity].
Speaker 2: I was gonna ask if it was CLEO.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And actually, we were the first class. And--I don't remember what the acronym--what the words in the acronym mean (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's--I forget--I should know it, too, but I know it's CLEO.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it was run by that program.  The purpose of the program was to introduce African American students to what law study was going to be like and we took courses, and it was a very good, very good experience.
Speaker 2: So you say the program occurred over--you said a semester, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the summer semester.
Speaker 2: The summer semester (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Prior to--and then I started the fall semester.
Speaker 2: Then you--right, 'cause that's how usually CLEO works, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: So what, what was the structure at that point in time?  So you would take classes?  Were you--were they bringing in lawyers to introduce--
Speaker 1: No.  We, we literally went to school; we were issued books, and the law professors at, at the University of Cincinnati taught courses.  They introduced us, we took a contracts course, we took a, a--we weren't graded on it; we took an exam and we--but we weren't graded on it but we did take courses.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, and--
Speaker 2: But would you take the courses like contracts and torts and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We took, we took courses that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That are taught typically in the first--
Speaker 1: --in the, in the freshman year of law school, yeah, yeah. Sort of pre-versions of 'em.  And then I stayed there and started in the fall at, at that institution and, and then transferred in about--I think it was about October I tran- or November, I transferred back to Loyola [Loyola University New Orleans College of Law, New Orleans, Louisiana].

Speaker 1: Now, talk also about the difference in the legal, the, the legal system in, in Louisiana versus the rest of the United States.  Can you talk about that a little bit (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: 'Cause it's based on a--
Speaker 2: It, it's, it's based upon a civil code, and the civil code is--
Speaker 1: As opposed to the common law.
Speaker 2: As opposed to the common law.  The civil code is a--I---the civil code that is used in Louisiana turns out to be the second draft of the code that was, that was--what's the word I wanna use?  It's, it's the second drafting of the code that Napoleon [Napoleon Bonaparte] had requested as he was becoming an emperor and had all these lands, all these countries that he had conquered; he needed to institute a, a legal system, and so he had his, his writers draft a code.  He didn't accept the first or the second; the third code is the one he accepted.  Louisiana took the second version of it, and that code comes out of the Hammurabi code, which is a biblical code of laws.  Our, our code is different in Louisiana in that individual rights are valued more than, than the rights of the, of the group, first off. And secondly, we don't necessarily follow the stare decisis theory in law that you look to previous cases to decide the current case; each case stands on its own, although now that has been refined to a point where, where there is a lot of looking at other cases.  A lot of the terminology is different, and I can't think of a particular instance.  I can tell you one significant difference between common law and civil law is that when you purchase something in common law and you don't pay the full price in advance, that thing does not become yours until you've made the final payment.  In civil law, when you purchase something, it is yours at the moment you sign the documents--that's yours.  And--
Speaker 1: So, even if you pay--purchase on installment basis.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, it's yours.  And if, if you fail to complete the payment schedule, the person who sold it to you has to go through court to take it back from you--has to have a, a hearing and everything to take it back from you, so it isn't a, a system that allows 'em to just come and take the item or article away; that's a major difference between them.  The, the criminal law is just about the same in both civil and common law jurisdictions, but this--the, the property side of--is, is where the big difference is.
Story_ID: 632044
Speaker 1: How did you--what courses did you gravitate towar- to in law school [Loyola University New Orleans College of Law, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Constitutional law was something I really enjoyed. Criminal law was something I, I really enjoyed, and we were not offered, offered large numbers of elective courses in law school; there were very few elective courses.  We had a, a strict curriculum that you had to follow.  I did--as I say, I did enjoy constitutional law, I did enjoy criminal law, although I never practiced criminal law.  I did take a, a couple a torts courses and I took a couple of property courses, which were interesting to me.  So those, those were the areas, and when I got out and got--ultimately got into the practice, it was the civil side and the, the, the personal injury and tort side and, and some, some constitutional stuff.
Story_ID: 632045
Speaker 1: Now, where were you working during the summers?
Speaker 2: When?
Speaker 1: During law school [Loyola University New Orleans College of Law, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Law school?  Oh (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Let me think--law school summers.  Oh, I remember.  The first summer I worked at something called, People's Action Center [New Orleans, Louisiana], which was a, a--sort of a, a place where citizens could go with all of their problems.  You had, you had people from the welfare department there, you had people from the social service agencies, as well as lawyers, and I was a law clerk for the lawyers at the People's Action Center.  The big client that they had at the time was the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party], and there was a big confrontation between the Panthers and, and the police department [New Orleans Police Department] at the time, and we were representing the Panthers and I did a lot of the research on the criminal cases.
Speaker 1: So, who, who were the Panthers?  I think of the Black Panthers in the North so, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, they were in--they were in New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: So, what was that branch of the, of the Panthers?  What were they?  Like--'cause, you know, I've heard the Chicago [Illinois] story, I've heard the Berkeley [California] story, I've heard the L.A. [Los Angeles, California] story.
Speaker 2: Well, they, they never got to the point where they were as formalized as the Chicago, the--Berkeley's Panthers; they was trying to gain a foothold in the city, and their basic issue at that time was housing.  They were--they had occupied some, some vacant housing in one of the housing projects, and they were staying there illegally, and they were on the streets talking to people and encouraging people to try to join, particularly young males, and it's--the confrontation resulted as a, as a result of them illegally occupying the housing in the housing project, and so the, the police set up a confrontation to evict 'em.  Interestingly enough, the Panthers, as you may or may not know, never disclosed their membership to anyone--not even their lawyers, because had they disclosed their membership, I would have known that one of my high school classmates had infiltrated--who was a police officer--had infiltrated the organization.  But because they would not disclose their membership, I didn't find out until after, long after, when they were in court, and he--and it was exposed that he had been the--one of the infiltrators from the police department.
Speaker 1: Now, how long ago after he did that did you, you find out?
Speaker 2: About a year.
Speaker 1: A year?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, when the trials went--came to fruition and he had to testify and then I, I realized who he was and I said, "Boy, if they had only told me, I would have known."
Story_ID: 632046
Speaker 1: And then didn't you work also with the New- New Orleans Legal Assistance?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was that dif- that was a separate summer?
Speaker 2: No, that was my first full time job.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: That was the Regi- I, I received a fellowship from Reginald Heber Smith foundation to do fam- community law, and I was assigned to the New Orleans Legal Assistance Corporation [New Orleans, Louisiana] as a lawyer, and so my first year and a half out of law school [Loyola University New Orleans College of Law, New Orleans, Louisiana] I did that; I worked as, as the Reginald Heber Smith fellow in the, in the New Orleans Legal Assistance Corporation.
Speaker 1: So this is, this is really when, when legal assistance is quite new.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, lot of things happening.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] involvement at all, or--
Speaker 2: No, no (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No?  Just--this, this--okay.
Speaker 2: Congress drafted a very strict policy as it related to what legal assistance could deal with, and so there were, there were large areas of law that we just could not deal with and, and so we had to abide by that.  Even though I was a Reginald Heber Smith fellow, I still had to abide by those, those areas because I couldn't create a problem for the legal services program in my community which would then put at risk the, the funding for the legal services.
Speaker 1: So the issues were housing?
Speaker 2: Basically housing, and the, the issues that poor people deal with all the time: job discrimination, job termination, housing, social security, you know, those kinds of things.
Story_ID: 632047
Speaker 1: Now, I wanna go back to, to just Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana] real quickly 'cause I had asked the question about who, you know, who have know- may have been in school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --at the same, and so--
Speaker 2: Several people.  Ruth Simmons who is, I think, now the president of Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island].  I had a, a--my friend Richard Stewart [Richard G. Stewart, Jr.], who went to law school with me, and we were in undergraduate school together.  He had a young--a brother who was one year younger than him who was a year behind us at, at Dillard, and who also went to Loyola [Loyola University New Orleans College of Law, New Orleans, Louisiana].  He is now a federal appeals court judge in the--on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]; he--I think he's the only African American on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals that I--that's headquartered in New Orleans [Louisiana], so these are people of, of notoriety.  The Lundy brothers, who have the Pizza Hut franchise, were in my class in, in law sc- in undergraduate school.  So, those are some, some of the noted--more noted individuals.
Speaker 1: So, Dillard--at that time, you said a lot of people came from outside the state, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, that was sort of--you're still in New Orleans but you're getting exposed and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, therein--even--and then, you know, your whole--
Speaker 2: Learning how other people lived, learning the mores in other communities, learning the social life in other communities, learning what the issues are in other communities and, and learning the differences between those communities and what's going on in New Orleans.  The--a, a great percentage of the population at Dillard was on scholarship and poor peop- poor kids.  Not that I wasn't a poor kid (laughter), yes I was.  And so you, you understood a little more about what the southern part of our country was like.  It's one thing to drive through it, it's another thing to live and go to school and, and be around people who come from those lifestyles on a daily basis.  A lot of people came from an agrarian economy, so I learned about that, you know--which is something I didn't know about, having grown up in a city.
Story_ID: 632048
Speaker 1: Now, you worked for Legal Assistance [New Orleans Legal Assistance Corporation, New Orleans, Louisiana].  I wanna go back to that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for a year, and this is nineteen seventy--let me see--
Speaker 2: Two [1972].
Speaker 1: --two [1972]. And then, then you worked there for two years?  And then you--
Speaker 2: It was about a year and three quarters; a year and a half to a year and three quarters, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then was it after that that you then started with--as--you worked for the legislature [Louisiana State Legislature]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I--
Speaker 1: Now, how did you get that?
Speaker 2: I had a friend who was a state representative.  I, I should mention that in the election of 1972, I believe it was, we elected, for the first time, five African American men to the legislature from the New Orleans [Louisiana] area, and I think that was an outgrowth of the, the reapportionment of 1970, and one of those individuals was someone I knew, and he was on a committee that was about to begin the process of studying and redrafting the juvenile laws for the State of Louisiana, and there were going to be two legal positions on that committee, so he called me and asked me if I had an interest in, in being counsel to the legal committee, and I said, "Absolutely."
Speaker 1: Now, his name?
Speaker 2: Louis Charbonnet [Louis Charbonnet III].
Speaker 1: Now, how had he--how did he find--know about you?
Speaker 2: We were in the same community. He, he had gone to the same high school [St. Augustine High School, New Orleans, Louisiana] I, I went to and, and--well, I guess that came later.  No, that, that was not--he just knew of--there were so few lawyers in New Orleans.  When, when someone graduated and became a lawyer, you know, it was pretty well known in the community, so he knew about me and he called me and asked me if I had an interest and I told him, "Yes," and so I went to work as the counsel for the legislative--joint legislative committee to study juvenile laws in the State of Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Now, what were--so that's really a good place to be, you know, because lawyers--right, you learn--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean it--you're saying that it's new in terms of blacks in the legislature first (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you under- you understand the political structure.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then--I wanna understand though, this whole juvenile (unclear).  Why was that necessary?
Speaker 2: Well, it was very antiquated; it needed to be updated.  And one of the things that they were looking at is they wanted to start a, a series of juvenile institutions throughout the state, and they wanted to put them under a new agency that would be exclusively running those, those institutions, and they wanted to change some laws as it related to definitions of, of juvenile crime--juvenile criminal activity, and what activities required harsh penalties and what activities required less harsh penalties.  And they wanted the juvenile justice system to interrelate greater with the social network that was out there--the social services system that was out there.  And so all of these things were looked at and all of these things were examined, and new laws were drafted basically for the purpose of what I would say liberalizing the juvenile justice system at that time.  But I have to mention that in addition to doing that specific work for the juvenile study committee, I also became sort of the in house ad hoc counsel to all six of those legislators, and anytime--'cause none of them were lawyers, and anytime they had a, a bill or something that they didn't understand or wanted to know something about, or wanted to understand better the legal ramifications, they would--I was, I was in Baton Rouge [Louisiana] at the time, and they would just bring it to me and say, "Read this over and tell me what this is all about," and, and, "How does this affect the law?"  And, "How does this affect us?"  And, and so I was doing a little bit of all of that at the time.
Speaker 1: So, who are the six?  Do you remember their names (Simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was Louis Charbonnet, Nick Conners [George C. "Nick" Connor, Jr.], John E. Jackson, Theodore Marchand [Theodore J. Marchand].  You know what?  That may have been it; I may have ex- I may have overstated.  It may have been just four.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm thinking there was a fifth one and I can't think of who it is now--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but--yeah, it was, it was four or five, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you were--so they really essentially mentored you though, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in a sense, yeah.  They introduced me to the legis- I'd never been to the Louisiana legislature before in my life, and they introduced me to the legislature, the legislative process, and I happened to meet a number of legislators, both African American and, and non-African American at the time, and learned a lot about that process and that system, which helped me a great deal later in life.
Speaker 1: Now, the--I, I can see how that would help.
Story_ID: 632049
Speaker 1: The lawyer--there's a lawyer in Baton Rouge [Louisiana]--oh, he is related to--
Speaker 2: C.J. Blache [Cecil J. Blache].
Speaker 1: No--
Speaker 2: He's related to who?
Speaker 1: Alton, Alton McDon- Alton (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Alden McDonald [HistoryMaker Alden J. McDonald, Jr.]?
Speaker 1: Alden McDonald.  It was his father-in-law?  Was--did--his fa--
Speaker 2: (PAULA SAIZAN):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Oh, Revius Ortique [HistoryMaker Revius Oliver Ortique, Jr.].  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, right, that was.  So--
Speaker 1: He's, he's in New Or- he's--he was New Orleans [Louisiana]; he was a New Orleans lawyer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was in New Orleans?  Oh.  And so he wasn't in--okay, I was thinking he was in Baton Rouge. Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Revius Ortique.
Speaker 2: So did--so did you meet him at that time at all?  'Cause he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yes, yes, sure.
Speaker 2: --he would have been pre- he's older than you. He would have--
Speaker 1: Revius was one of my mentors, along with Dutch Morial [Ernest Morial] and--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  I see, okay.
Speaker 1: Revius had a, a law practice that was in the same general area that--when I, when I--after I left the legislative process I went into the private practice of law, and Revius' law office was not far from our law office and--
Speaker 2: Okay--well, we're get- okay.
Story_ID: 632050
Speaker 1: So, I want--this whole thing that you're doing--so you have newly elected--
Speaker 2: African American legislators (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) legislators.  And a, and a young lawyer.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, what are the things--what are the issues you--'cause they're learning as you're sort of learning (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, and so what was that whole process really like?
Speaker 2: It was exciting, it was interesting, to a great extent those (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did they all get elected at the same time?
Speaker 2: All got elected at exactly the same time.
Speaker 1: As, as part of the whole reapportionment.
Speaker 2: From Orleans Parish [Louisiana].  I know what it was.  There were six African American legislators in the entire legislature [Louisiana State Legislature].
Speaker 1: I see. Four (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Four of them were from New Orleans [Louisiana], the other two were from out of Orleans.  One was in the Baton Rouge [Louisiana] area, and one was from Shreveport [Louisiana] area.  Those six guys became the face of the African American community in the State of Louisiana, and they all lived together in an apartment building, we had meetings where we would meet on an--almost a daily basis after the session was over to talk about what went on; to talk about personalities and characters of, of the other members--not, not the other African American members, but the other members that they were having to deal with; to talk about how to go and talk to the governor about getting stuff for their communities.  It was a--it, it was a very exciting time and, and I really felt like that I was in the center of something that was, that was making a difference.  I remember one year we did a, a statewide tour where we went to various communities around the state and talked about the issues that were going on--the things that they were trying to do for the African American community in Louisiana, and so it was, it was fun.
Speaker 1: And you did that how, how many years?
Speaker 2: I did that for three years.
Speaker 1: Three years.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what--
Speaker 2: Full time for one year, and part time for two years.
Story_ID: 632051
Speaker 1: So, what were the--can you also describe how long the legislature meets in New Orleans [Louisiana].  And I mean I'm sorry in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In Baton Rouge [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: --in Bat- I mean Louisiana [Louisiana State Legislature].
Speaker 2: The legislature meets for ninety day sessions.  They usually start the last week in April and they usually end at the end of June. Excuse me.
Speaker 1: And that's just one--once a year?
Speaker 2: Once a year.
Speaker 1: So this is how the government--
Speaker 2: This is how the state government runs, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) the state government runs, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So budgets and everything were--
Speaker 2: Everything is dealt with, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And at that time, of course, no African American sat on the budget committee.  The most powerful committees in the legislature they wouldn't allow African Americans to sit on because it--you, you got appointed to a committee by the speaker of the house, and the speaker of the house was a redneck from north Louisiana and he had no interest in doing anything for African Americans.
Speaker 1: So, what, what were the occupations?  Because then people are doing other things for the rest of the year (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Of--yeah, of, of those four guys?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: One was a contractor, one was a high school teacher, one was an undertaker, and the other one was a community activist (laughter).
Speaker 1: You know, I was just thinking, you know, when you ran for office later, you know--remember you--on the other interview you were saying (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --how, you know, you were being re- pretty reflective about how you had your law school degree [from Loyola University New Orleans College of Law, New Orleans, Louisiana] and you lost to a white guy who had a high scho-
Speaker 2: No, I beat--
Speaker 1: You beat!  Oh, you beat him (simultaneous)!
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I beat the white guy, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, you beat him!  Okay.
Speaker 2: What I was--
Speaker 1: But what about the 29 percent--okay, go on.
Speaker 2: I got 29 percent of the white vote--
Speaker 1: The vote, vote--I see.
Speaker 2: --the white vote, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, sorry.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, um-hm. It was--I--
Speaker 1: Go on.
Speaker 2: I was just gonna say that, that, that was something that all African American candidates experience in the, in the South, and particularly in New Orleans.  We have had just outstanding candidates run for public office and it is very difficult to get above 30 percent of the white vote until Ray Nagin came along, and that's a whole 'nother story.
Speaker 1: I see.  Okay.  Now--except not, well no one gives him any time a day these days.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: Sort of persona non gratas.
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah.
Story_ID: 632052
Speaker 1: So you said you did--so you did that full time for a year, and then part time for two years (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  And when I say, part time, I mean that I was full time at the legislature [Louisiana State Legislature] when the legislature was in session, and when there were meetings, I had to go to those meetings but it wasn't a day to day function, so I was allowed to--I was able to go off and, and join into a law practice--a private law practice the second two years, and I would just have to leave the law practice to spend three months at the legislature, or to go to a committee meeting or something like that--or work on something for the, the committee.
Speaker 1: But you did work on the, the rewriting of the juvenile code (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.
Speaker 1: That was something that you, you, you completed, and that was in 1975.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So now, tell me then the, the law practice 'cause it was Gerdes, Thierry
Speaker 2: It was--
Speaker 1: --and Valteau.
Speaker 2: Gert- it, it start--this is, this is Ernest Morial's old law firm and A.P. Tureaud, I should say.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A.P. Tureaud's old law firm.  It started out as A.P. Tureaud.  Not long after that, A.P. Tureaud took in a young fellow by the name of Ernest N. Dutch Morial, and it was Tureaud and Morial.  After that came a, a, a young fellow named Gerdes, Louis Gerdes, G-E-R-D-E-S [Louis A. Gerdes, Jr.], and he came into the practice and then Dutch got elected and Tureaud retired, and Dutch got elected to the legislature and then he got elected to a judgeship and he could no longer practice, so a, a fellow by the name of Overton Thierry, T-H-E-I-R-R-Y [sic.] came into the law practice.  Mr. Thierry, unfortunately, had some legal problems and had to resign and leave, and then I came in, and it was Gerdes and Valteau [New Orleans, Louisiana], and then another--a fellow name Herbert Cade [Herbert A. Cade], who is now a judge also, came into the practice and it was Gerdes, Valteau and Cade [New Orleans, Louisiana], and then I left and got elected sheriff and it was Gerdes and Cade, and then Cade left and became a judge and it's back to Louis Gerdes [Louis A. Gerdes Jr. Pro Law Corporation, New Orleans, Louisiana] by himself, and that's where it is now.  So, that's the history of the firm.
Speaker 1: Can I ask, though, in that history of the firm, how many other black law firms were there during all--you know, all this time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There, there were--there was only one other black law firm in the city--
Speaker 1: And who was that?
Speaker 2: --and that was Collins, Douglas and Elie [New Orleans, Louisiana]; that would be Robert Collins [Robert F. Collins], Nils Douglas, and Lolis Elie.  That firm was probably as old as the original Tureaud, Morial firm, and both firms were--have--very heavily involved in civil rights and, and filing of suits for integration and voting rights and all of, all of the, the lawsuits that went on during that era.
Story_ID: 632053
Speaker 1: I wanna talk about the dynamics of the black law firms--
Speaker 2: Okay, sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you know; if you, you could cover that, you know--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and who was who, you know--who--how did each get started, who was who and, and--what--okay--I don't know; you can take it from there (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, you want me to start, okay.  Well, let's see--
Speaker 1: 'Cause you were really with the--I mean I--they were both well respected but you were with the law firm (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, I, I--you say the law firm.  I, I don't know that, that either firm could be called the law firm; they both did significant work in, in making New Orleans [Louisiana] what it was before Katrina [Hurricane Katrina], but you had--there were, there were two driving forces in each law firm once Mr. Tureaud [A.P. Tureaud] retired; there were two driving forces in each law firm--Bob Collins [Robert F. Collins] in, in one and Dutch Morial [Ernest Morial] in the other.  Now, while those were the two major law firms, there were several single practitioners who were around; the most notable of that group would be Revius Ortique [HistoryMaker Revius Oliver Ortique, Jr.], who made a--quite a name for himself as a, as a gentleman and a scholar and a first class lawyer on his own, in his own office, by himself on a corner of Galvez [Street] and St. Bernard [Avenue], but in the two major African American law firms, the driving forces were Bob Collins and, and Dutch Morial.  Interestingly enough, those two individuals were competitors throughout much of their career.  They both started LSU [Louisiana State University Law School; Paul M. Hebert Law Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] together, but Dutch Morial, because he wanted to be the first to graduate from LSU, went back one summer without telling Bob, and took some summer school courses so he could graduate early (laughter).  At one point they were both vying for the affection of the same young woman (laughter) and, and that was Sybil--Sybil Haydel, who eventually became Sybil Morial [Sybil Haydel Morial].  And so when they got out of law school and got into the practice of law, they joined with different people and formed different law firms and, and remained, to a degree, competitive throughout their career, and both of those men were dynamic forces.  Both had a number of firsts to list in, in their careers, so--
Speaker 1: Was it a friendly competition or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a friendly competition, absolutely, yeah, yeah, because they--we all worked and they all worked for the, the greater good of the, the community and--they would jab each other at times and, and make fun of each other and--but it was a, a--basically a friendly competition over the years.  It--by the way, it was also out of those two law firms that, that the politics of New Orleans--the African American politics of New Orleans got its, its start.  In, in Collins, Douglas and Elie, you had Nils Douglas, who started an organization called the Southern, Southern Organization for Unified Leadership, commonly known as SOUL, on the streets of New Orleans, and it was probably the largest African American political organization in the city because it encompasses--encompassed the largest neighborhood or community, which was the entire 9th Ward [New Orleans, Louisiana].  And then you had Bob Collins who founded the organization called COUP, C-O-U-P, which was Community Organization for Urban Politics, and that was an organization that operated out of the 7th Ward [New Orleans, Louisiana].  Interestingly, it is that even when it came time for blacks to step into political power, they followed the same pattern that many of the white politicians and political organization fol- followed--in that organizations followed, in that they were generally organized around a ward in the City of New Orleans, and it was ward politics in--in its, in its greatest sense.  So, those two firms and the people in those two firms were, were very dynamic individuals and, and the, the city's political base changed as a result of what those people did.  The city's economic--the African American community's economic base was enhanced by what those people did, the social community was enhanced by what those people did; they, they touched every, every part of the life of, of the African American community, and they were the, the prime litigators in many of the, the major lawsuits that took place in, in New Orleans in the 1960s which created the, the modern society that we have today.
Story_ID: 632054
Speaker 1: So, can we look at what are the key forces, you know, happening?  So you have blacks in the state legislatures--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --legislature [Louisiana State Legislature].  You have your lawyers.  Who--what are the other key things?  Who, who also are the social--you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think, I think you had a vibrant bus- African American business community at the time.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about that, too?
Speaker 2: It was basically made up of people like the undertakers, the funeral home operators and, and the barbers, the barbershops, the neighborhood barbershops, the beauty parlors, the--we even had some hotels around town at the time; the real estate agents. Those were all, all people who were involved in the movement and people who were pushing to move New Orleans [Louisiana] to a place where it became an open city and a city that, that everyone had access and opportunity in.  So, you had very viable communities at that time and, and, and individuals that were very viable at that time; unfortunately, we've lost that over the, over the, the passage of time.  Those people died off, they weren't replaced, the funeral homes went out of business because they got eaten up by competition, the beauty and barbershops are far and few between.  What is left is probably just the churches and, and I neglected to mention the ministers at the time who were also a powerful force in the community--not in the sense of the megachurches that we see today, but more in the sense, again, of the smaller churches that were community oriented that were neighborhood fixed assets, that the ministers were well recognized people in the city (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So who were some of these ministers and who are some of the businesspeople and--
Speaker 2: The funeral homes would be the, the major funeral homes in New Orleans--the Rhodes family, the Michaux family, you had the Holtry family, you had the Haydel family.  You had the ministers like the Landrums [ph.]; the Landrums were three brothers who had churches in, in several parts of town.  You had--I'm drawing a blank (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: But there are--there were several ministers who were outstanding.  Oh, A.L. Davis, Avery Alexander [Avery C. Alexander], who were very outstanding ministers.  A.L. Davis had, had been a--and Avery Alexander had been forces in the communities going all the way back to the '40s [1940s].
Story_ID: 632055
Speaker 1: A.L. Davis happened to be the first African American to get appointed to the New Orleans City Council, so they--
Speaker 2: And what year was that?
Speaker 1: This was in 1972--might have been '71 [1971].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What happened is--
Speaker 2: So that's probably around the time the--as the state legislature [Louisiana State Legislature].
Speaker 1: Absolutely, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So all this is--
Speaker 1: All this happened at, at very much the same time.  What happened is the nineteen--the, the, the city charter required that the city council reapportioned itself after every census; the same thing was required of the state legislature.  In 1970, the state legislature went ahead and reapportioned itself and created six black districts throughout the state, and that's when six African Americans got elected.  The city council refused to reapportion itself because they realized that they were going to have to create at least one African American district, and so they--there could not be an election in 1970 bec- for the city council because they refused to reapportion, and we had to file a suit against 'em in federal court to challenge and their refusal to reapportion. And that suit went on for three years and they continued to serve for three years.  During the pendency of that lawsuit, one of the city council members left the council, ran for a judgeship and got elected, creating a vacancy, and in that vacancy, Reverend A.L. Davis was named to fill that vacancy in the remainder of that term.  The election was finally held in 1973 and that's when a, a, a, a council member wa- African American was elected, was elected, finally elected to the city council, and one, one district was created.  Subsequent to that, two other districts just developed as a result of population shifts, and two other African Americans were elected to the council after that.
Story_ID: 632056
Speaker 1: Now, is there discussion in the firm [Gerdes and Valteau, New Orleans, Louisiana] about--at some point, I, I don't wanna say this--maybe after Dutch Morial's [Ernest Morial] election or even--I'm wondering if it began before that when he was a judge.  Is there, is there discussion about--is there a plan?  Let me put it that way.  Is there a plan or a wish list going, you know, as, as a part of discussions like--
Speaker 2: There were discussions every time African American lawyers got together to talk about--and there was an organization called the Louis A. Martinet society [Louis A. Martinet Legal Society, Inc.] and--of, of black lawyers, and Louis A. Martinet was a free man of color who was a lawyer and who was someone that, that the, the organization was created and named after.  There, there were discussions at, at all points along the way about possible offices that could be achieved, positions that, that we could, that people could run for, and in addition to that, once Dutch Morial got elected to a judgeship, very often he would come by the office in the evenings on the way home and stop, and we'd have lengthy conversations.  We'd, sometimes we'd go out to a restaurant and talk and have lengthy conversations about what was out there, what was available, how many people would it take, how many African American voters we would need to get someone elected to something, and so it--the focus was always at, at the, the political mainstream because I think we all viewed the political mainstream as where to go to access and to open the doors for the community as a whole.  So, yeah, it was, it was always a conversation--there was always conversation about that.
Speaker 1: You know, because I, I was just talking to someone the other day about the lack of plan here in Chicago [Illinois], so--I mean now, and I--you know--
Speaker 2: I, I don't know that I would say that there was any written plan or--but, but there was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, but I'm saying even discussions.
Speaker 2: We viewed it as opportunities, and we were always looking for an opportunity--for the opportunity to do something.
Speaker 1: Can you, can you tell me--in those discussions, what was the vision, you know?  What was like, this would be great.
Speaker 2: The vision was to raise African American voting strength to the point where African Americans could have adequate representation on every aspect of the governmental level.  To a great extent, I think that's still the vision in, in many places and particularly in Louisiana because we've yet to elect someone to a statewide office in Louisiana, and there are five statewide offices in Louisiana that we, we could elect someone to, but--yeah, those are, those are constant discussions--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) I think.
Story_ID: 632057
Speaker 1: And what were you learning yourself in this whole--you know, during this time period because--now, the structure of the firm [Gerdes and Valteau, New Orleans, Louisiana]--let me, you know--so there--because you became a name partner when?  You know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right away (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right away?  That's what, that's what I'm (laughter)--
Speaker 2: It wasn't, it wasn't like, like the major--
Speaker 1: Once you were brought into the family--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It wasn't like the major law firms that, that you see today.  You don't work an apprenticeship and work your way up to becoming a partner; you, you were a partner when you walked in the door.  And partnership didn't have the kind of emoluments in, in small black law firms that they do in the major white law firms; it just meant that you were there and you were a participant fully and, and you were equally responsible.  So, no attempt to, to exaggerate the importance of it; it, it, it was just a, a way to identify you as being a member.  I think, to a great extent, you wanted to put as many names as you could in the title of your law firm because the more people saw those names, they might know one a those guys, and that would bring you business, so that's, that's what you were looking to do more than, than what the major firms use the process for today.
Story_ID: 632058
Speaker 1: When was your, you think your thought about really running for office?  When do you--do you think it was born back when you were working on the juvenile co- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  My first experience with the legislature [Louisiana State Legislature], I was really excited, and I said, "This is, this is where I gotta be; this is where the action is, and this is where the fun is, and this is where the excitement is."  And so I--and I just happened to live in a district that was being represented by a white legislator that was 60 percent black at the time and I said, "Man, this is, this is the place to be; I'm gonna have to look at running for this."  And, and so I started talking with the other legislators about it and, and they thought it would be a good idea, and so I, I took a run at it in, in 1974, I think it was--or '75 [1975]; did not win, but I did take a run at it. And I think that, that election was where I really bonded with Dutch Morial [Ernest Morial] and, and even though we had been friends and had been talking quite a bit before that, I think that, that we, we bonded as a team in terms of looking at future potential for electoral politics.
Speaker 1: What do you mean by that, really bonded?
Speaker 2: Well, we got to know each other better, we--he understood that--I understood that electoral power was what we were both looking for, or electoral opportunity; I shouldn't say power--electoral opportunity was what we were looking for, that we've both viewed the electoral process as a way to raise the entire community and to open doors so that other people could come in.  And I think that he saw in me someone who had a, a deep and abiding belief that it was through politics that we were going to better our lot, and so we meshed in that respect and we started spending a lot more time together.  And prior to that, when he would come to the office [Gerdes and Valteau, New Orleans, Louisiana], it would usually be four or five of us sitting around talking about politics.  After that election, it was usually he and I spending most of the time together talking about politics.  We, we would go up to Baton Rouge [Louisiana] quite a bit for legislative activities and, and the other guys wouldn't wanna come because they really didn't have a great interest in politics; they were much more interested in practicing law and we, on the other hand, were equally interested in the law as well as politics because we both saw it as a vehicle to get, to get the community beyond where it was. And so I think that we, we bonded and meshed and became one of purpose, so to speak, at that point.
Speaker 1: Because it was funny to hear the beginning part of his campaign, you know?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Did his--the beginning part of his campaign remind you--your campaign--your first campaign?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, quite a bit (laughter).
Speaker 1: 'Cause you don't think about that (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) 'Cause we were, we were both under- woefully underfunded (laughter), and we were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, you don't think about that because he's a legend in that way; you know, you don't--you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and we were using whatever resources we could.  I probably didn't tell you everything about us (laughter), but at one point, he had, he had borrowed every penny he could on his life insurance policies to continue to fund the campaign to keep it going.  At a, at another point--in fact, this was right before the election--the primary election.  We were flat broke, and--I mean we had maybe a thousand dollars in the bank account, and we had like ten, twelve organizations that wanted money to put all their stuff out on the street, and I just made the decision, I said, "You know what?  He's gonna win, and I'm gonna write these checks because we'll be able to take care of it after."  And I wrote ninety thousand dollars' worth a checks and had one thousand dollars in the bank account.  And I called the bank and I said, "Float 'em for the weekend," and sure enough, he won, and by Monday afternoon, we had a hundred thousand dollars in the account, and by the end of the week, we probably had a quarter of a million dollars in the account, but it was a huge risk on my part.
Speaker 1: That's an amazing story.  Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 632059
Speaker 1: I wanna go back to your campaign just for a second--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) your first campaign--and ask you what you learned in that process, you know--what, what--because all the things, you know, that you had been doing over the years, you know--meeting with people, you know co- I mean all that led up--that's what politicians have to do, even in the campaign process.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, sure, sure, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Shaking hands, talking to people.
Speaker 2: I learned a couple a things.  I think the first thing I learned was a very bitter lesson for me, and that was that you've got to know the district or the area that you're running from before you qualify to run because I thought I knew it, but I didn't, and it caused me to lose the election because I--although I had grown up in the neighborhood, I had grown up on one end of the neighborhood, and I didn't see the other end of the neighborhood and its transformation, and did not recognize that transformation until I got into the point of walking the streets, knocking on doors and talking to people, and I began to realize that these people don't know me and I don't know them, and it was going to be a really difficult election.  I think, I think the other thing I learned is that--
Speaker 1: But Paul [HistoryMaker Paul R. Valteau, Jr.], can you go back?  What was the transformation?  What was the one side of town that you--and what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The trans- the transformation was from a neighborhood that I grew up in and I knew everybody to a neighborhood that had transformed, and a lot of those people that I knew had gone--
Speaker 1: And who had replaced them?
Speaker 2: --and it was supplanted by, by a, a, a, a whole new generation of people that I did not know, and I presumed that they knew me and they didn't.  And that was the other lesson I learned, that no matter how many people you think know you, it's never anywhere near what you need to get successfully elected, and you've gotta spend a lot of money to raise your name recognition because people--while, while--if you're a candidate or an elected official, or a public official, you spend a lot of your day thinking about politics, thinking about elections, thinking about those kind of things related to politics.  The average citizen thinks about it once a year, and that's the day he has to go and vote.  And you, you don't realize that as a--you do once you've become elected to office and you've spent some time there, but when you're a novice starting out, you don't realize that the whole world, in the minds of the average citizen, revolves around politics.  Well, it doesn't; it revolves around their daily lives, their family, their children, their husband, their wives, their, their financial situation. That's what their lives revolve around, not, not politics. Not this elective office that you're trying to get.  And so that was an eye opener for me.  I think the other thing I learned was that--the, the third thing was that, "Money," as, as my friend Dutch used to say, "is the mother's milk of politics."  And a poorly financed campaign is usually a doomed campaign.  And I say usually because I know of the one exception to that rule, and that was the Dutch [Ernest Morial] mayoral campaign of nineteen eight- '77 [1977].
Story_ID: 632060
Speaker 1: But when you, when you decided to write those checks, why were you certain about that?  I mean (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because I had spent the previous year and a half on a daily basis with Dutch Morial [Ernest Morial], and we had gone to churches, we had gone to nightclubs, we had gone to barbershops, we had gone to beauty salons, we had gone to graduations, we had gone everywhere you could positi- you could possibly go, and everywhere we went, he was received with such acclaim, such excitement, and such energy that I was convinced that he was gonna win--that the black--we knew what the black vote was, and I was convinced that if just the black vote came out, he was gonna get enough to be in the runoff, and once he made the runoff, that would bring a significant amount of money into the campaign that--so I wasn't really worried about it and went ahead and, and wrote those checks 'cause I really felt strongly that, that we would be in the runoff.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about the night you won?
Speaker 2: Sure.  I'm, I'm, I'm trying to engage that part (laughter) of my memory, so--it was, it was very exciting.  I, I can remember this.  I can tell you--I will tell you something that I've told no one else about--no, this was the runoff.  I'll tell--you asked me about the runoff and I'll tell you that.  I will tell you this.  The night before the election, we went to a union hall and we--there was this--there was--I forget what it was--some kind of function for the, the members of the ILA[International Longshoreman's Association], and Dutch spoke and, 'course, it was to great applause and, and excitement and interest, and you know, it was almost like being around a rock star 'cause everybody wanted to touch him, everybody wanted to feel him, everybody wanted to, wanted to shake his hand, everybody wanted to whisper something in his ear.  And going home that night, when we got to his house I said, "Dutch, I'm gonna address you by your new title, Mr. Mayor."  And that was exciting for me.  And he said, "Oh, we'll see what happens tomorrow."  I said, "No, you know, you know it's in the bag."  So, he went to bed; the next the day the election started for us bright and early because we got started like 4:30 in the morning, and getting every- everything out and everybody out. And the day went well.  We, we felt better and better as the day went on. That night, we were in a--we didn't even have a hotel (laughter); we, we were in the, the--what was it called (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Office?
Speaker 2: We were in--we were in the building that was--that the office was in, but it was called the, the Peter Claver Building [New Orleans, Louisiana]--the Peter Claver Building.  And we had a little function there and, and the media was running around crazy trying to find us (laughter) 'cause we, we didn't just make it to the runoff, we led in the runoff and the vote, vote get out, the turnout of the vote in the runoff election.  So they finally caught up with us and, and it was just, just really a satisfying feeling, it was, it was an emotional evening, it was, it was very exciting.
Story_ID: 632061
Speaker 1: But at the same time we knew that there was a lot of hard work in front of us because we were still talking about New Orleans [Louisiana], it was 1977, we had a, a white opponent and there was a significant--we weren't gonna win the runoff with just black vote; we needed to get a significant white vote to win that election.  And so the excitement, the fun and the, and the good feeling was tempered by the fact that we knew we had a lot of work ahead of us, so we enjoyed the evening and then we had a meeting bright and early the next morning and start talking about how we'd win this runoff.
Speaker 2: And what did you decide was necessary?  How are you gonna get the white vote, and what was--
Speaker 1: Well, we brought in a, a speechwriter--professional speechwriter who wrote a piece that was run as a full page ad in the Times-Picayune, which was called the--I can't remember the full name, but it had something to do with conscience and it was, it was appealing to the conscience of white New Orleanians, and we then decided that we had to get all of the opponents on our side.  There was one opponent that we were particularly interested in who had a well financed campaign and a, a, a really serious effort.  It was such a serious effort that when we finally got him on our side and he agreed to let us come to his campaign headquarters and get all of his lists and all of his voter stuff, we went there, and when I saw the machine that he had in place, a chill went up my spine because I said--I thought to myself, how did this guy lose?  He had compu- we, we had (laughter)--he, he had a computer based volunteer coordinating committee--computer base.  Our volunteer coordinating committee we had--you remember the old Coke boxes that, that Coke [Coca-Cola] used to be delivered in? A wooden box?  And it had like twenty-six holes in it for each one of the co- that was our list--that was the way we categorized it by alphabetical order in the twenty-six holes on cards that we had (laughter), and it was just frightening how well organized this guy was, and he finished third.  But once we got him on board, we felt pretty good that, that we were gonna be able to get enough of the white vote to win, and it did in fact happen, and that was a, a, a very glor- a very great night for us.  And then the, the night I'm gonna tell you about, and I have a picture of this, is after he [Ernest Morial] was elected, and it was the day before he was sworn in, we had--there was a big party on--a fundraiser party on, on the steamboat at, at the foot of Canal Street, and during the party, he said--he came over to me and he said, "Let's go man, I gotta go home and get a good night's rest so I can give this speech tomorrow."  So I said, "Okay."  So, he said, "Come, come to the house; I want you to do something for me."  I said, "All right."  So, we went home--we went to his house and--I think his wife [Sybil Haydel Morial] and his kids had left earlier because when we got there, they were in their pajamas.  And so he said, he said, "Come in the kitchen." So I, I went in the kitchen.  He said, "I want you to swear me in."  (Laughter) He said, he said, "I don't know if I'm gonna live through the night, but I wanna be the mayor."  So, he said, "We gonna sit here and wait 'til 12:01, and then you're gonna swear me in."  And so I swore him in and he was in his--he was in his shirt--his tuxedo shirt, I was in my tuxedo shirt, his wife was in her robe, and his children were in their pajamas.  And I have pictures of it, and I swore him in.  The next day when he was sworn in in front of all the citizens and the public, that was (laughter), that was just a, a form; I had already signed the papers and, and had 'em in my possession.
Story_ID: 632062
Speaker 1: --Morial [Ernest Morial] story.
Speaker 2: (PAULA SAIZON): Are we (unclear).
Speaker 1: Probably, probably the one I just told you.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The--because I think it expresses a couple a things about him.  It expresses, first of all, his, his wanting to be first.  At the same time it, it expresses his lack of confidence in the system--that he wanted to make sure it was done before he went to sleep that night.  It expresses his vulnerability because it, it expresses that he had questions about whether he'd even live through the night.  So, he was a very complex man, but you either loved him or your hated him, and if you were his friend, that was it. Whatever, whatever you could, whatever he could do for you, and whatever you, you could do for him, he would--you know, it was, it was a bonding--particularly with us.  It was a bonding, it was like brothers.  In fact, his sons used to call me Uncle Paul [HistoryMaker Paul R. Valteau, Jr.] (laughter) at the time.  I stopped 'em; I told 'em, I said, "Man, I'm not old enough to be your uncle. Call me brother" (laughter).  So Jacques [Jacques Morial], particularly, used to call me Brother Paul.  But it was, it was a great time--it was a very special time in life.  I'll tell you another story about him.  After he got elected mayor, there was--the white business community, while they generally supported him, they were kind of standoffish because they never knew what he was gonna do to challenge their authority--what they viewed as their authority over the city.  And this one particular developer--excuse me. I hope, I hope you cut that out. There was one particular developer who owned some wharfs at the foot of Canal Street. These were old rickety wooden buildings that had a, a post supporting it about every ten feet, and they were good for nothing but the storage of, of warehouse material that came off of ships, and this guy got it in his mind that this would make a great--this building would make a great convention center, and so he went in to Dutch and pitched the idea and Dutch asked him if he was crazy; it was a old rickety warehouse and it had, had--it had poles, posts every ten feet, and it would never be a, a massive span of space where you could have conventions and activities, and this was around the time of the 1984 World's Fair [1984 Louisiana World Exposition, New Orleans, Louisiana] but a year or two before the World's Fair, where it was being--the, the area was being prepared for the World's Fair, and so this guy had visions that his wharf would be turned into part of the World's Fair and, and he'd make a huge profit on it, which is another sideline about New Orleans [Louisiana] is that the wealthy white community often use government to enhance its wealth.  So Dutch went to the legislature [Louisiana State Legislature] and proposed that a brand new convention center be built.  This guy wrote--handwrote Dutch a letter saying, "You'll never build that brand new facility.  My wharf is gonna be the convention center." Sent it to Dutch. Dutch held that letter in his desk drawer his entire term as mayor and probably took it with him to his grave.  And anybody who was his friend who knew about the, the enmity between he and this developer who came to his office, he'd call, call 'em, "Come here, I gotta show you something," and he'd pull the letter out and he'd show--said, "Look what that SOB sent me" (laughter), and he said--he'd show it to 'em.  And so he, he relished a victory, like, like everyone I'm sure, but he really relished victory.  And he had a number of 'em, and it was often against the, the majority community at the time, particularly the white business community.  But, but he was--he, he loved New Orleans, he loved his city. He, he just had such, such vigor and, and, and excitement about his community that you rarely see these days.
Story_ID: 632063
Speaker 1: Now, around the time that he was elected--let's look what's happening nationally with black mayors.  So there is--Gary [Indiana] has had theirs [HistoryMaker Richard Hatcher], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then--this is before Chicago [Illinois], 'cause Chicago doesn't come in until 1982, and then there's Phil- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  Atlanta [Georgia] had had Maynard Jackson--
Speaker 1: Maynard Jackson.
Speaker 2: --and Dutch was next, and Birmingham [Alabama]--
Speaker 1: Came after that.
Speaker 2: --was after that. And, and then there were a series after that; I, I don't remember their succession, but Houston [Texas], Dallas [Texas], Memphis [Tennessee]--a number of cities, Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], got black mayors after that.
Speaker 1: This is even feeling more powerful because it is the South, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.  It's more powerful because it's the South.
Speaker 2: Actually, at the time, when Dutch Morial [Ernest Morial] was elected, New Orleans [Louisiana], believe it not, was the largest city in the South.
Speaker 1: Was larger than, than Atlanta (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Larger than Atlanta--city--just, just the, the confines of the city.  We had a larger--at that time, Atlanta's city population was about four hundred thousand; we were about five fifty [550,000].
Story_ID: 632064
Speaker 1: Did you ever think, though, about--was it always assumed you were gonna run for office, or did you think about ever serving in the, his administration and that's--was that, ever come up?  Especially since you have been so close to the [mayoral] campaign [of Ernest Morial].
Speaker 2: I was offered--I was asked; he asked me if, if I wanted to serve in the administration and I told him no because at the time I had a very viable law practice and, and really had no interest in being a government employee at that time.  And then I was, I was still harboring some distant interest of running for something at some point; I didn't know what--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And then you ran for the--
Speaker 2: I ran for sheriff, yeah.
Speaker 1: --sheriff, okay.  And so can you--now, the whole thing about you running for sheriff, you were running against--who--you, you were replacing, right?  Milton, was it Milton--
Speaker 2: Stire [Milton Stire].
Speaker 1: Stire, right--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who ran for--you know--and he was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was the incumbent; he had been a sixteen year incumbent, and he was a member of the--he was a member of the old Huey Lo- I mean Earl K. Long political machine.  He had been the fire marshal, he had been something else in state government, and then he became the sheriff of Orleans Parish [Louisiana] and served in that position for sixteen years.  He was seventy something years old and he was very sickly and not gonna run for reelection, so I decided to run.
Story_ID: 632065
Speaker 1: And is every- you know 'cause some of these posi- oh, yeah well, sheriff would, sheriff is elected here; it's elected in most cities.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, tell me about your campaign and how that sort of, you know--did you take the same approach that you were taking previously?  You were in a different position--
Speaker 2: Well, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean and, and, and society--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the community--I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, the first thing that was different was I was much more recognized at the time.  I was--after Dutch got elected I was, I was--by the newspaper--
Speaker 1: The person.
Speaker 2: --considered to be the genius--one of the geniuses in the [mayoral] campaign.  There were--they, they did a big article about five of us who made a difference in Dutch Morial's campaign.  Anybody who knew Dutch Morial [Ernest Morial] knew that Dutch Morial ran his campaign (laughter). All you did was executed what he told you to do.  So I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you still were a confidante.
Speaker 2: Yeah--oh, I was, I was, I was the confidante.
Speaker 1: Yeah--no, no, no, no.  Right, right, right, right.
Speaker 2: I was probably the, the closest person to him outside of his wife [Sybil Haydel Morial] and family that, that was around.  I, I was much better known at the time.  There was, there was a, a citywide knowledge of who I was and--
Speaker 1: Paul [HistoryMaker Paul R. Valteau, Jr.], can I stop you one second?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can we stop the tape? 'Cause--
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Where were we?
Speaker 2: Oh, you were saying that--you know, you were recognized so, you know, you were the confidante (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I had a, I had a citywide recognition factor at the time, and anticipating the run for the office, I had had some fundraisers, and so I had some, some funds in, in an account, so I was preparing the right way to run for, for office.  And I had spent about a year and a half in the (unclear) of Dutch Morial campaigning in the city. Going to every meeting, going to every union function, going to every church, going to every school, going to every social function that I could find, stopping off at the barrooms, stopping off at the beauty parlors, stopping off at the barbershops, and that just continued to raise my, my level of, of visibility in the community. And so I, I prepared obviously differently because it was a citywide race, but also there were factors that existed that were different, such as the, the, the knowledge that people had of me, and the ability that I had to raise money at the time, which allowed me to raise some money to get ready to run for the position of sheriff [of Orleans Parish, Louisiana].  The election took place at the same time as Dutch Morial's second election for office, and so we sort of ran as a team, and we were both successful.  My, my election was not that difficult because I had a couple of dummies, to use the word, running against me.  I should say uneducated people.  They were not just uneducated from a school sense, but they were also uneducated in terms of their knowledge or understanding of the legal system--they were not lawyers, and so it, it wasn't difficult to outshine them.  But much like Dutch, I was extremely disappointed after the el- even though I had won by a significant margin; I was extremely disappointed at the outcome because I only got 29 percent of the white vote when I was running against a high school graduate.  So, it, it was a reflection of, of the racism that still existed in the community.  I can remember that there were a number of lawyers who, who didn't support me because they did not want to see an African American hold that position because it was too important to their legal careers, they felt.  I can tell you that once I was elected, there were a number of whites who worked at the sheriff's office who quit because they were not gonna work for a black man.  So, that was the tenor of the day.
Story_ID: 632066
Speaker 1: So for Dutch [Ernest Morial], this was probably a very important position to have--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, yeah, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) someone--you know, his person and becau- a friend, and because of what it controls.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a, a friend, yeah--and a confidante, yeah--absolutely.
Speaker 1: And, and so what--can you describe what were the key positions that were key for him--I mean in terms of other political offices.
Speaker 2: Well, city council [New Orleans City Council] for sure.  The district attorney was important, and you had seven city council people and the sheriff.  And the, the governor was a very key position to have as, as an ally because the, the city always went to Baton Rouge [Louisiana] looking for money and looking for support, and we had--at the time that Dutch was mayor, we had a friend in the governor in terms of Edwin Edwards, who was a Democrat--a liberal Democrat who was supportive of New Orleans [Louisiana], and so those, those were important positions as well as state senators and state legislators.  So they were all important at that time to him.
Story_ID: 632067
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, what did you find--like how large was the budget for the, for the, for the she-
Speaker 2: What I found was shocking.  The office budget at that time was not very big; it was maybe a million dollars a year. But--
Speaker 1: And how many staff?
Speaker 2: At that point it had about ninety people.  The bigger problem, however, was the fact that the office was run ad hoc.  When I, when I took office, the most modern piece of equipment in the office was about a twenty year old Royal electric typewriter.  There was not a phone system, there was not a, a receptionist, there was not two desks or chairs that matched, there was no personnel file, there was no information on any employee.  It was a nightmare, it was an absolute nightmare.  I had to literally construct an office out of nothing--a public office, out of nothing.  And so for the first--much of the first three or four years of my term in office I was, I was organizing the office, setting it on sound footing, and establishing it by imposing and putting into place rules and regulations, you know.  Just all of the basics that you normally assume exist did not exist; they weren't anywhere, and we were very successful in that--something that I'm very proud of.  We, we put people into positions where they could be successful as employees.  My predecessor [Milton Stire] ruled pretty much as a dictator. He, he--his office was not under the civil service system, so he hired and fired at will.  There were people who were bookmakers that he hadn't been able to pay off who were employees; I got rid of all of those people.  There were people who would get payroll checks who didn't even know where the office was (laughter), got rid a those people.  It was a nightmare, an absolute nightmare.  And it took a considerable amount a time just to reorganize the office and get it on sound footing and get rid of all of the unnecessary people that were there, and his cronies and that.  But that was, that was the politics, the political era that he grew up in and the way he operated, and this was modern time.  I, I (laughter), I like to tell people I first had to bring the office into the 20th century, and then before I left, I brought into the 21st century, so we changed significantly the profile of the office as well as the, the view by the public of the office.
Speaker 1: So, you know what's interesting about that is that that's not the first time that, you know, African Americans have been elected, and the systems, you know, whether they were patronage or whatever, and I think that's a little untold story about the professionalization--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that happened under people better educated and--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, Absolutely (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you know, coming into a system.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  We, we had employees going to training--something they had never done before.  We introduced computerization, we were the first public office to computerize in 1988 in the city [New Orleans, Louisiana].  We professionally trained our employees and required them to be professionally trained.  We instituted just basic policies like telling everybody that you were gonna have ten, fifteen, or twenty days of vacation every year based upon how many years you've worked in the office; that was something that didn't exist before.  People, people had to beg the sheriff for vacation, and if he was in a bad mood, he'd tell 'em no, and they couldn't go.  He never told anybody how much vacation time they have, how--had, how much sick leave time they had, or anything.  So all of these things, I mean it was literally starting from scratch.  I had--the, the first day in office, I had to design an application form and give it to every single person that I saw because I didn't know who was employed and who wasn't employed, and then have them fill it out and give it back to me, and then I took 'em home and I had to go through every single one of 'em and figure out what it was they did.  Half of 'em didn't even know what their job was, couldn't explain it, and oh, it was a nightmare; it was a real nightmare, but we turned it around and made it a very professional operation.
Story_ID: 632068
Speaker 1: So, did you--at--you know, at this time, there's a real excitement.  I wanna go back to this whole thing of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --cities being run by black mayors--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and, you know, Maynard [Maynard Jackson] being such a force.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was the relationship between he and--
Speaker 2: Dutch [Ernest Morial]?
Speaker 1: --and Dutch?
Speaker 2: They were friends.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: They were, they were good friends--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --both from a, from a mayor to mayor standpoint as well as from, from powers in the Democratic Party.  They, they aligned themselves on the same issues, similar issues, and similar activities.  At the beginning of his second term, [HistoryMaker] Andrew Young got elected to the mayor of Atlanta [Georgia] and they were even closer because they knew each other, having grown up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cause Andrew Young is from New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 2: Yeah, from New Orleans, having grown up in the city.  And, again, issues around the Democratic Party were important to him.
Speaker 1: Well, let's look at this because we're also talking about time when Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] is, is president (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Reagan is president, yeah.
Speaker 1: So we got Reaganomics and Democratic Party is, you know, off the railing, and we're also in time of inflation, too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: The interesting thing, though, about Reagan is--and, and, and I am not at all a Reagan fan, but the interesting thing about Reagan, when you talk to some of those mayors, Reagan--actually it goes all the way back to Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon].  Nixon implemented a number of the--
Speaker 1: Affirmative action.
Speaker 2: --affirmative action programs, Reagan picked up on 'em--they were not used in the Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] era--but Reagan picked up on 'em, and many of those programs like the Urban Development Action Grants and stuff like that, were things that Reagan funded out of the--out of his philosophy of government. And city mayors really prospered to a great extent.  The urban mass transit stuff--all of that stuff came through Republican administrations and, and a great deal of development in cities happened in, in either the Nixon or the, the Reagan administrations, oddly enough.  So they--despite the fact that they were extremely conservative, and despite the fact that they were probably anti-black, and despite the fact that they were, you know, just generally awful people, I think they had an understanding that in order for the nation to be great, the cities had to be great, and they did what they needed to do to see that the cities were sufficiently funded so that they could be great.
Speaker 1: See, I've not heard that from the city standpoint but I, I--you know, but I've heard that from the black business standpoint--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, the--which is different when you get to the Bush Republicans and the current day (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, much different, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 632069
Speaker 1: So you also, though, in 1980 started your first entrepreneurial--or you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Seventy-nine [1979].
Speaker 1: Seventy-nine [1979], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, that's the Coc- The Grove [The Grove, Inc.], The Grove (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Grove, yes.
Speaker 1: --'cause I, I've seen the--there's still--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So how did that opportunity come to you?
Speaker 2: I was a--an avid skier at the time and I used to go to Colorado two or three times a, a year to ski, and I was in the Denver airport [Denver International Airport, Denver, Colorado] stuck one time and I saw this little stand, and I said, "That's, that's a neat concept," and I asked for a business card and, and got the business card and came back to New Orleans [Louisiana] and it, it, it just bugged me.  I kept thinking about it, so I had this, this friend who I had met through fundraising with Dutch [Ernest Morial] who was a retailer.  I had never been involved in retail, didn't know anything about retail and, and I called her up and I said, "Listen, I saw this thing in, in Denver [Colorado] and I think it might be a good idea.  I'd like to talk with you about it."  So she said, "Sure, come over."  So I went over to her office and I picked her brain a little about retailing and about this business, and she said, "Let me go, let me go catch a plane and take a look at it."  So she went up to take a look, look at it and she came back about as excited as I was about it.  So I said--she--I--we talked about it and we said, "Well, let's do it."  So we called the people and we bought a franchise from 'em, set up the first store in New Orleans on December 31st of 1979 in the New Orleans airport [New Orleans International Airport; Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, New Orleans, Louisiana].  My dad [Paul R. Valteau, Sr.] and I put the first store together because (laughter)--the reason I had to call my dad is because the guy who was supposed to install the store came down to New Orleans without any of his tools.  I don't know if they got lost on the flight or what.  So I called my dad and he was--had been a handyman all his life, had tons a tools, so I called him and told him, "Come out to the airport and help us out."  So he came out and we put the thing together on December 31st of, of '79 [1979], opened for business the first day, Monday morning, January 1st of '80 [1980].  And it was a very successful--we, we had paid off the investment the first two weeks, and so we said, "Let's buy another one."  So, we bought another one, put it at the other end of the airport; paid that off in the first month.  So we said, "This, this is great--this is fabulous!"  So we continued to operate those two stores, and we--at the end of the first year, we were beginning to have some supply problems because when we bought the franchise, you had to sign an agreement to buy all of your products from the people in Colorado, so we, we were talking about it one day and we said, "Well, why don't we go and meet and talk with these people about seeing if they will allow us to purchase products from other places."  So we flew out to Denver with the intention of talking to them about getting out of the contract to buy exclusively from them and being able to buy from other places, and we flew out on a Friday morning, and by Sunday we had completed a deal to buy the business from 'em (laughter), so--the business wasn't very big at the time; they had three stores in the Denver airport and they had two shopping malls in, in some--I, I don't even remember where they were--up in the Northwest somewhere.  So, we bought the business and we moved everything down to New Orleans, and we then decided to grow the business.  Well, we--first we decided to learn about the business, and then we decided to grow the business, and we spent the next twenty years growing the business and, and having fun.
Speaker 1: So who is we? Who's the p- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My partner's name is Ruth Ann Menutis--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and she was a businesswoman in New Orleans, had about ten stores in the French Quarter [New Orleans, Louisiana] at the time, and was a very successful retailer, and we were 50 percent partners, and the business has been great.
Speaker 1: So it's still, right, The Grove?
Speaker 2: We don't own it anymore; we sold it, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I see.  When did you sell it?
Speaker 2: Two thousand [2000].
Story_ID: 632070
Speaker 1: But this, this whole time period, see, that's the other thing; the airport business [The Grove, Inc.]--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) came as a result of mayoral election.
Speaker 2: Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Because the issues of--
Speaker 2: The, the airport in American cities was the last entrepreneurial opportunity that was left when African American mayors started to take over. And we were on--not knowing or being aware of that fact, we were on the cutting edge of that.  In fact, we were one of the, one of the groups that helped form the AMAC organization, the Airport Minority Advisory Council, which is an organization of--it started out as African American business owners who operated in airports. It's, it's now minorities of all stripe, who operate in airports.
Speaker 1: So when did that organization start, Paul [HistoryMaker Paul R. Valteau, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-three [1983].
Speaker 1: Eighty-three [1983], 'cause I--really, Judy got--Judy Byrd [Judith Byrd], who I mentioned earlier--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I think got involved around that time or a little late (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Judy was working for Unison [Unison Consulting Group, Inc.; Unison Consulting, Inc.]--
Speaker 1: Right, that's right.
Speaker 2: --and she got involved in it at that point, which was in the earl- late '80s [1980s], early '90s [1990s].
Speaker 1: Nineties [1990s]?  Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you had been in it already for--
Speaker 2: Since 1979, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So who was, who was the beginning part of that group then?  Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: The beginning part of what?
Speaker 1: AMAX [sic.]?
Speaker 2: Oh, AMAC?  Actually, it was two guys who, African Americans, who had been employees of the civil rights division of the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration], and they decided--Clark Sharpe and--I can't think of the other guy's name right now.  But they were in their latter days at the FAA and they were looking to transition out and--but before they transitioned out, they wanted to start this organization that would, that would begin to represent minorities in, in airports because what was happening at the time, airports were transitioning from--if you remember, when airports first opened, basically what you had was bars and sit down restaurants that served three, four and five course meals with white tablecloths and, you know, premium wines, and that kind of stuff; there weren't any snack food.  We were one of the first snack food businesses to open in airports, and so we were unique in that respect, and basically you had two major concessionaires at the time; you had Marriott [Marriott Corporation] and you had Sky Chef [LSG Sky Chefs]--were the two major food concessions operators in airports, and they basically ran the restaurants and the bars, and that was it.  So we came in with these snack food concepts--what they call finger foods--and that revolutionized the industry, and then you started to see all kinds of things.  After about ten years of us in the business, you began to see all kinds of things come into the marketplace, and less and less concentration on, on the major food and beverage operator controlling everything, so that's how that has evolved to a point where you've got operators all over the place who are involved in these businesses.
Speaker 1: So, you were gonna say something else, though, before I cut you off.  I can't--I don't remember--
Speaker 2: No, I was gonna explain to you the, the evolution (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: --of the food service in airports--that it went from sit down restaurants to finger food and to snack food, like hot dog stands and, and hamburger stands, and other kinds of, of things--sandwich shops and, and that kind of stuff, that changed the makeup of the airport from being a place--and it was, it was in conjunction with the change in air travel.  Air travel used to be a leisurely kind of thing where you went to the airport in a business suit, coat and tie, you got on a plane, and whether you went coach or first class you got a three course meal, you had liquor, you had--you know--everything-first class treatment, and the, the airline people were, were falling over themselves to be nice to you.  And it was a leisurely kind of thing where maybe you went and had a full meal before you boarded the plane or--with the family, and then you got on the plane and flew somewhere and had another meal on the plane.  And airlines were gradually converting to a situation where they were getting away from serving these full meals, and they were getting more into snacks, and it was becoming a more leisurely form--I mean a more, more mainstream form of travel.  Actually, in today's market, I believe that the airport and the airline has taken the place of the bus station, and it is now the, the primary means of transportation for most Americans.  So the--we've, we've lived through a complete transformation of the air travel system in our country.
Story_ID: 632071
Speaker 1: The one thing I--I just wanna ask one other question as it relates to the airport, 'cause, so you were really in that business for twenty years.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So twenty, twenty-one years.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: The return on investment, was it--it, it was--what, what percentage 'cause it sounds like you could like make profits real quick.  Did, did it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I never sat and calculated the return on investment, but it was significant--it was huge.
Speaker 1: And what made you get out of the business then?
Speaker 2: I think that--we're not out of the business.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: We're still in airport businesses.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm so--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But you're not with The Grove [The Grove, Inc.].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, so what are you--I don't think I understood that in your (laughter)--
Speaker 2: We, we do, we do two, two things now--we do Raising Cane chicken [Raising Cane's USA, LLC], which is a, a southern product, mostly in, in Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, Texas, Oklahoma. It's growing nationally, but it's growing very slowly.  It's a chicken finger kind of thing.  And the other one (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what, what's the franchise called?
Speaker 2: Raising Cane.
Speaker 1: Oh, it's--oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Our business is called Branded Works [Branded Works, Inc.]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and the other activity that we're in is we're doing yogurt.  We are, we are--we have a exclusive agreement with Pinkberry [Pinkberry, Inc.] to do Pinkberry yogurt in airports, and we just won a bid at DFW [Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, Texas], and we're gonna be opening some stores at JFK [John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York, New York] after the first of the year, so we've, we've just moved in a, in a different direction.  But the reason for us getting out of the nut business, The Grove, is a couple a things.  I think we had grown weary of it, you know, 'cause it was a very small operation that we had.  There were basically three people who did everything, and we had become tired of it; we had spent a lot of time in it, we had put a lot of our--plowed a lot of our capital back into the business because the airports require that you renew and refresh every five years and, and it is hugely expensive to build airport locations.  So, while it was, while it was very profitable, it was also very costly. So at the end of the day we, we didn't have that, that significant amount of money.  And I think I may have made a mistake.  I, I told you 2000--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --I think it was after--it was after 9/11 [September 11, 2001].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was 2002 because we, we suffered a significant loss as a result of two--
Speaker 1: 9/11 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 9/11.  We suffered significant losses 'cause most of the airports--and at that point we were in about twenty-three airports--most of the airports required us to continue to pay rent even when there was no traffic, even when they weren't open. And so it just ate up all the reserves that we had.  So we, we were kind of afraid of the business at that point, and didn't have the ability to sustain long term viability and were looking for ways to move on to something else, and ultimately we came back to the airport business again (laughter), so.
Story_ID: 632072
Speaker 1: So, can we, can we talk about the, the, the--'cause you were, you were work (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, as, as, as I discovered in most situations in my life, once I got into something, I looked around and I was the only one, and that's not a comfortable feeling for me, so I've always wanted to do what I could to open doors, enlarge the base, invite other people in.  So, one of the things we did was we found some people in the business around the country and we came together with these two guys at the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] and we formed AMAC [Airport Minority Advisory Council], and we began to meet on a regular basis to talk about issues that were important and critical to us, as well as to introduce, and to begin to put pressure on, those major food concessionaires to allow minority businesses, at that point, we were focused only on African American businesses, to allow African Americans to participate in the last vestige of entrepreneurship in our cities.  I can remember speaking at a number of our conventions, and that was always my tagline that this is the last vestige of entrepreneurial opportunity in the city, and we cannot cede it to anyone else; we have to be a part of it because this is our opportunity to become entrepreneurs, and to move our people upper class in society, and that had to be, it had to be what those airports were about, and if it wasn't, then the airports and the, and the public officials were not using those facilities for their best and, and first, and most important purpose.  So we did a number of things, and I took it upon myself--my partner [Ruth Ann Menutis] and I--because we--our business was fairly profitable, and so we took it upon ourselves to just go to cities and start talking to people.  I went to Houston [Texas] and I just started talking to people and telling them, "You gotta get involved in the airport, you gotta do something about the airport."  And so, over a period of two years, I took a group of people who knew nothing about the airport, educated them about the airport, enlightened them about the airport, taught them how to operate in airports, and then led them through the process of the bid to get businesses in the airport, and then help--show them how to operate their businesses after they got in, and created some very successful entrepreneurs in the process (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so who are some of the people that you, you helped create?
Speaker 2: Harlan's BBQ [sic. Harlan's BBQ and Catering LLC]--probably the biggest; Smith's [ph.]--the Smith family.  There were a set of twins who had Wendy's franchises [The Wendy's Company] in the--in Houston airports.  There was--actually, there was a Hispanic lady who had a, a, a, a pizza and a, a, a--place in the airport.  All a these people were people that we mentored and that we brought into the airports, but we had people more than just in Houston; there were people all over--people in Atlanta [Georgia], people in Chicago [Illinois], people in, in Denver [Colorado], people in Phoenix [Arizona].  No, I, I traveled quite extensively during those years, and visited cities, met with people, talked to people about how to get involved in the airport, talked to people about putting pressure--and then we put pressure on the, on the major food concessionaires and let 'em know that their position needed to be to encourage minority businesses.
Story_ID: 632073
Speaker 1: And as a result of that, the AMAC [Airport Minority Advisory Council] organization has grown over the years from, from the little, little group of six or ten people; it's almost a thousand--maybe more than a thousand people now. And they have a major convention every year and there is usually five or six hundred people in attendance at the convention, and it is a hidden, it is a hidden source of entrepre- minority entrepreneurship in this country that a lot of people don't know anything about, but they're out there--
Speaker 2: 'Cause you would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and they're making a difference.
Speaker 2: Right--and what's amazing is people--you wouldn't know that if there, if there weren't African American mayors--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 2: --because that--that's a area that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 2: --you know, except the shoeshine stands.
Speaker 1: And, and, and I might add, that is one of the frustrating things about, about some of the Republicans that are in [U.S.] Congress right now, particular- and particularly when the Republicans become the committee heads, because you see legislation then that is bent towards reducing minority participation in these businesses.  Now, these are people who aren't begging for a handout, who put out their own money to start a business in an airport, and to, and to live in effect the American dream.  But you have people in Congress, particularly on the Republican side of the fence, who try to limit them any way they can.  For instance, the business [The Grove, Inc.] that I--that we started many years ago which, at its peak, operated in twenty-five different airports, it would be almost impossible to replicate that today because they've put so many rules and regulations in place, so many requirements that inhibit your ability to grow in terms of you can only have net assets of X number of dollars, you know; you can't do this, you can't do that, you know; it's, it's just--
Speaker 2: So at twenty-five locations, wasn't that one of the largest?  Or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --at the time it was.
Story_ID: 632074
Speaker 1: Can you talk about how you--what you did to run your business [Branded Works, Inc.] and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes--yeah, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you know, 'cause after you bought it--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Well, we--the first ten years we operated, we bought from a variety of suppliers around the country.  We used to have a nightmare of an operation where we would have to match up trucks coming from different cities, from different companies, converging here in Chicago [Illinois] at a warehouse where we would just drop our stuff off and then have to, have to redistribute it to all of our stores, and after doing that for about five years, we said, "You know what?  We're probably buying enough raw product that we can afford to create our own warehouse and production facility."  So we started looking around and, and we found a place in Dallas [Texas] and we purchased, along with another couple a, a warehouse that was out of business--a thirty-five thousand square foot warehouse, and actually it was a warehouse and a retail space, and we converted that to our warehouse and production facility and at, at the peak of that operation we had two, two 18-wheeler refrigerated trucks who were traveling the country delivering the product to all of the stores. One assigned to the West and one assigned to the East.  And we had a, a, a retail operation, we were packaging nuts, and at one point we used to do $2.5 million a year of business packaging small packages of nuts for the first class cabin on American Airlines. We lost that business though, because they, they don't do that anymore--it's too expensive for them.  That's why it goes back to the discussion I was having with you where I was telling you that the airline business has now gone from first class transportation to like the bus station, yeah.  So, that business continues to operate, and we continue to have a interest in the retail--in the wholesale business, and we produce a variety of lines of products.  We do a, a catalog for the holiday season where people can order from the catalog, so it's a--
Speaker 1: So you were learning a lot about business during this time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely, absolutely.  In, in fact, we had to travel not just the country, but we've been to, to South America and negotiated contracts with cashew suppliers and other nut suppliers. We've negotiated contracts with the dry fruit people down in, in Central America.  It's probably not known to many people, but the better dried fruit products come from Central America, not from the Philippines or Southeast Asia where they used to come from. There are more of them coming from Central America now. So yeah, we learned the business, we learned every aspect of it from shipping to finding the best suppliers because that was a--the, the, the specialty that we had was that we only used the best of everything, and in the nut business you have a, a whole--you have whole nuts, you have half nuts, you have quarter nuts, and then you have super whole, and we bought the super whole; it's called SLW.  Super large whole was the--were the nuts that we bought and used in our business.  We only used sea salt in our processing when we salted a product.  So, we had to learn a lot about a lot of different things, and then when the federal government came out with the need to print the contents on the back of the packaging, we had to learn all of those things and all of that information to be able to put it on our packaging, so yeah, I've been--I'm pretty well versed in a, in a variety of areas.
Speaker 1: But--and you were also very hands on, so you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely, yeah.
Speaker 1: --sheriff during the day and bus- and entrepreneur (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Businessman and entrepreneur at night, yeah--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and all day on weekends.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 632075
Speaker 1: And then you also were taking care of your daughters, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I have two--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --I have two daughters that I'm very proud of; they're thirty (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Their names?
Speaker 2: Michelle [Michelle Valteau] and Collette [Collette Valteau]; they are thirty-one and--thirty-two and twenty-nine right now.  One is a lawyer in Atlanta [Georgia]; she went to Wellesley undergraduate school [Wellesley College, Wellesley, Massachusetts] and, and to Duke University law school [Duke University School of Law, Durham, North Carolina], and she is working at Emory University law school [Emory University School of Law] in Atlanta now.  And my youngest daughter is a businesswoman in New York City [New York, New York]. She works for a company called Gartner [Gartner, Inc.], which is a company that does seminars for major corporate clients around the country, and she puts together the seminars for the corporate clients. So they're, they're beautiful young women and I'm very proud of 'em, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's great.  So--'cause you were talking about that that was taking all your time, that you didn't remarry--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) until 2007--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, that--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Story_ID: 632076
Speaker 1: I wanna go back to--well, let me ask, though, about the airport business.  So, 9/11 [September 11, 2001] was difficult.  Were there any other things that were highs in the business and lows in the business?
Speaker 2: Well, every time you won a, won a contract, that was a high, and, and it was--for me it was always exciting to see more and more African Americans involved in the business.  I mean going to the AMAC [Airport Minority Advisory Council] convention on an annual basis in those early years was exciting because every time you went, you met somebody new, somebody who was doing something else in the airport, and you could just see your dream coming to fruition, that these people were in their communities, they were--the doors were being opened, they were being allowed in, they were making significant progress, and so it was exciting.
Speaker 1: You know, the other thing that I'm curious about is what concessionaires were particularly difficult, and which were the pioneers in terms--since you were on--in so early, who was pioneers in terms of--
Speaker 2: Sky Chef [LSG Sky Chefs] was the pioneer; they let us in, and they let us into New Orleans [New Orleans International Airport; Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, New Orleans, Louisiana], they let us into New York LaGuardia [LaGuardia Airport, New York, New York], and the let us into New York JFK [John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York, New York].  Marriott [Marriott Corporation] was the worst--Host Marriott [Host Marriott Corporation; Host Hotels and Resorts, Inc.] was the worst; they never wanted any minorities, and if they were forced to take a minority, they would make sure that you would be put at a spot that would be a definite spot to fail in, and that's why we--it wasn't until almost 2000 before we entered into any agreements with Marriott.  And in fact, in our early years, here's what Marriott did us.  They saw our product--they saw our, our operation in the New Orleans airport and they called us up and they said, "We're very excited about what you're doing in the New Orleans airport and we think it's a great idea for airports.  We'd like to fly you out to Los Angeles [California] and have a meeting with our executive staff to talk about how we can incorporate you into our, our concept around the country."  So we went out to Los Angeles, met with their executive staff for a whole day; they picked our brains about every aspect of the operation--every single aspect of the operation.  We, we used to have a little card that we would leave on the counter at our stores for customers to fill out, telling us whether they liked our product, what they didn't like, what they did like, and whether or not they were treated courteous, and that kind of stuff.  About six months after--or a year after our meeting with the Marriott people, we started getting comments from people saying, "But your store in Seattle [Washington] is nothing like your other stores and it--the food doesn't taste as good."  And we, we laughed at it; we just said, "This is somebody who's confused; they just don't know.  We don't have stores in Seattle."  And then there was a store in Salt Lake City [Utah].  "I went by your store in Salt Lake City, and the food was not as good and the people weren't as nice, and--," so finally, I said, "You know what?  I'm gonna take a trip because--." We were getting so many of 'em, I said, "There's gotta be something going on out there."  So, I took a trip that routed me through to Salt Lake City and Seattle, and there was one other city and I forget where, where it was.  But I went to the three cities and what I discovered is that Host Marriott had opened up a kiosk just like ours, and was operating under the name of Filbert and Macintosh [ph.], and their efforts were to try to put us out of business.  And boy, we were upset.
Speaker 1: Did you sue them?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't because they didn't, they didn't violate any of our patents.
Speaker 1: Oh!
Speaker 2: And they used a separate name.  And we were, we were mad enough to sue, but we had no basis.  And so what we did was we've, we've rolled up our sleeves and said, "You know what?  This is our challenge.  We gotta outlast them."  And we did--they shut 'em down.  After about two years of attempted operation, they went out of business, and ultimately told us, "We just never could figure out what your success was" (laughter).  So, so we, we had a taste of what it was like to tangle with a major company and, and that's why I say Marriott was--that's part of the reason why I say Marriott was not receptive to minorities operating in airports. And forever--the one area where no minority was ever given an opportunity was to operate a bar in an airport because the bars are the most successful businesses in airports.  Now, you talk about make money, you get one bar in an airport, you can retire for life (laughter), they make that much money.  Until Marc Morial [HistoryMaker Marc H. Morial] got elected mayor in New Orleans [Louisiana] and he decided to open up the New Orleans airport and insisted that they put a bar in the possession of a minority, and a DBE [disadvantaged business enterprise], an African American male operates the bars in, in the New Orleans airport--two of the bars in the New Orleans airport.  And he's done quite well.
Speaker 1: Well, he was well informed I think--Marc Morial (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I told, I told (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I was gonna say that's why--I think he was--well, he had a good advisor (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 632077
Speaker 1: I wanna go back to you as sheriff [of Orleans Parish, Louisiana]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --because there was the--you had said that you wanted to discuss other things (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I never finished--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --because I started talking to you about the, the, the significant problem it was to convert this office from the patronage pothole it was to a sophisticated first class operation.  When I, when I started to engage with the state association [Louisiana Sheriff's Association], I found very much the same atmosphere and, and attitude, and it was like a patronage pothole and, and all the sheriffs did whatever they wanted, there was no communication with one another, they really didn't care what each other did, and so I've began to talk to 'em about trying to have a more, a more formalized operation, and specifically as it related to fee schedules.  There--you could go to ten different offices in ten different parishes in the State of Louisiana and the cost for the basic service was different at every office.  So ultimately, I got them to agree to put in a bill to uniform the fee schedule throughout the state, and we were successful in passing that.  I, I worked that one pretty hard, and that's where a lot of my legislative experience from when I was back on the, on the committee as an attorney came into, into use.  Not only did it come into use because I understood the legislative process, but many of the legislators were still there, and so they remembered me--they knew me, and I took the lead on that.  And as a result of my success there, the state sheriff's association asked me to head up the civil section of the state sheriff's association, and so that put me as the person responsible for all le- all legislation that related to civil matters in the sheriff's association.  And as a result of that, I started doing a seminar on an annual basis for all of the sheriff's offices, telling them about the latest changes in the legislature [Louisiana State Legislature] and how, how that would transform their offices, and what they would have to do. And I created a, a sort of a--I call it a hotline, but I created a, a phone number where they could call us anytime they had an issue, a question, or a problem about something they needed to do with a, a piece of litigation in their parish and, and to our uniform goodwill, they used it, and it helped create a cohesive force in the state where we could--where we started to communicate and started to understand each other's problems and, and each other's issues and, and it, it, it made for a much closer knit association.  So we, we did that.  And then I wrote and composed a handbook for service of process, which is now being used throughout the state by, by sheriff's offices around the state.  And then I went--when we, we converted from a mainframe to a PC [personal computer] network, I created a program that allowed the public to go in to the sheriff's website and acquire all the information they needed to get about real estate auctions, and at least ten of the sheriff's offices throughout the state are using that program now.
Story_ID: 632078
Speaker 1: I created seminars within the City of New Orleans [Louisiana] to teach citizens how to come and acquire property.  The motivating thing for that was I was doing the auction one day, and a woman came and she bid, and she had her daughter and her granddaughter, and she was a successful bidder on a, on a--really a junk piece of property, but she was gonna put forth every effort to try to bring it into, into habitability.  And the woman, when she was determined to be the successful bidder, started crying.  And she came to me, she said, "Mister, this is the first time I've ever owned anything in my life."  And I--it was so touching that I really went back to my people, I said, "You know we, we have gotta do something to be able to get these auctions in the hands of the average Joe."  When I took over the office, there was an auction every week of real estate--when I took over the office.  The auction was held in a room about half the size of this room, and there were five people who bought every property every week.  They would stand outside the room, and they would decide who was gonna buy which property.  There would never be any bidding; that first bid would be the win.  When I took over, I took it out of that room--and, and by the way, the room was in a private office building away from the government office, so I brought it back to the courthouse in the lobby--at noon. I started advertising in the minority newspapers, and started to do everything I could to get that information to the community.  As a consequence, a significant number of minority bidders have come to the auction over the years, and bid on property and could come on--every week and bid on property and successfully buy property.  You know, these were, these were the kind--these are the kind of things that take place in the community that we don't ever find out about, and it prevents us--because the foundation of the wealth in any community is home ownership, ownership of real estate, and the sheriff's office is where the rubber meets the road.  And if you don't do it there, it isn't gonna get done.  And so it, it, it was the kind of thing that I thought, I thought was extremely important to create the ability, so I--so in, in conjunction with that, I also created a, a lecture series where once a month at night, so that people who work could come to it, I would do a lecture at the courthouse, and we would get two hundred to 250 people at a time who would come out, and I would explain to them the auction process, I would explain the whole legal system to 'em, how it works, the auction process, how to bid, what are the pitfalls; everything.  And a number of people would come after going to that lecture and bid on properties and successfully buy 'em.  I was really, really proud of that.
Story_ID: 632079
Speaker 1: Now, how was the press viewing you?
Speaker 2: I think generally favorably.  The press saw me as generally a, a good public official.  I had a, a couple a minor scrapes with 'em when we got into the security business and, and were protecting government buildings, you know.  They would run a cameraman through and he'd catch somebody talking on a telephone and they'd make a big story out of that or something like that, but that--the other thing that happened is, in addition--when I first got elected [as sheriff of Orleans Parish, Louisiana], in addition to finding the office in shambles, for many, many years--even before I was elected, I used to go into the schools and, and talk to kids on a regular basis. And what I, what I realized was, after I got elected and I was still going and, and talking to kids, I realized that I needed to have, it needed to be a lot more people than me going to talk to these kids. And so the first thing I did was I got--organized a group of friends and, and created sort of a, a lecture, a lecture group, and we would go into schools and talk to kids.  And after doing that, I realized that the kids I'm talking to are so woefully under educated that very few of them are going to get the opportunity to become a lawyer or a doctor, so I thought, how do I attack this problem?  And what I did was I said, "You know what?  What I've got to show these kids is that you're not--you don't have to just be a doctor or a lawyer to be a success; there're a lot of other things you can do to be a success."  So I started getting just regular guys who were, who were successes--just--you know, the barber, cab drivers, cooks, you know--every, every field I could think of.  And by the time we reached full staffing, I had twenty-five men and women who would go into schools and talk to kids about their careers, about what they did, about the--and about the fact that they were a success, a contributor to the community, whether it be a ca- I even have--had a garbage man. A guy who collected garbage was on the, on the group.  And they would go in and, and they would talk to kids so that kids could see that--even the kid who wasn't making A's and Bs could see that there was an opportunity for him to be a success in life, and that he could be proud of what he did regardless of what it was.  And we did that for the entire time that I was in office.  We had that speakers bureau and we would--we called it the school talk program, and we, we would just go into schools in every--we probably went to every school in the parish.  The other thing I did was--there was a school business partnership program with the Orleans Parish school system [Orleans Parish School Board], and there was traditionally about seven schools that could never get a school business partner because the business partners always wanted to be with the better schools, the more glamorous schools, more--so I went in to 'em, I said, "You know what?  Give me those seven schools; I'll take 'em, I'll be their school business partner."  And we went to those schools and we made a difference.  We raised money for those schools, we brought our, our, our lecture series to those schools, we had--at one point we even had a, a beautician come in and teach the girls how to dress, how to wear makeup, and how to fix their hair if they're going on a job interview.  We had a, a barber come in and talk to the boys about how to dress, how to fix their clothes, what to look like, how their hair should be cut to go for a job interview, and we had people who taught 'em about how to fill out a job application.  I was talking back in the early '90s [1990s]; I was talking to these kids about the fact that when they got out of school, the job application was not gonna be on the other side of a wooden door; it was gonna be on a little screen in front of 'em, and some of 'em didn't understand it but I could see what was coming down the line, and I just felt it, it had to be said.  I don't know how many of 'em got it but it had to be said.  We, we even--I--one--I had a--I had--my personnel director had a daughter who went to work for GE, and they gave her a brochure of what they expected all of their executive level employees to understand, and I was thumbing through it one day, and on page three of the brochure was a two and a half page discussion about how to act at a dinner table--what knife to use, what fork to use, what glass to use; this is General Electric, GE.  So I said, "Wait a minute; if this is good enough for GE--." I got a friend who owns a restaurant.  I picked up the phone, I called him, I said, "Look, I want you to teach table etiquette to kids in high school."  He said, "That's a great idea."  He said, "I'll be happy to do that."  I said, "Well, how many people can--how many kids can your restaurant take?"  He say, "I'll take twenty-five."  We set up a program where every year twenty-five kids went to that restaurant, and it was one of the top restaurants in the city, and they had lunch at that restaurant.  He closed the restaurant for them, they went through a lecture series where they learned what fork to use, what knife, what plate, what spoon, what cup, what glass, you know--and they learned all those things.  And they had a meal, and it was great, I thought, for the kids and, and great for, for people who felt like they were contributing.  So, it--you know, all of those things I, I believe helped our community (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So really, in a way, you took that office and really enlarged the whole concept of public service.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Story_ID: 632080
Speaker 1: Now, how many, how many blacks were on staff when you were--when you took over?
Speaker 2: About twelve.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then how many were when you left?
Speaker 2: How many African Americans?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: The office was probably 98 percent African American when I left, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, did you--I want you--do we have to change now?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.  I want you to talk about the, the landmark suit.  Was that the preference privacy--preference?
Speaker 2: The, the presidential preference primary (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Prep--right, right, sorry.
Speaker 2: In 1984, Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] announced that he was gonna run for president.  Dutch [Ernest Morial] and I talked about it and we agreed that, that we needed to be there, so we called Jesse up.  He came down to New Orleans [Louisiana], we talked to him, told him we were gonna take charge of the campaign in Louisiana.  He said, "Great."  The governor at the time, who had been our friend, Edwin Edwards, who was a liberal Democrat, decided that he wasn't going to have a Democratic preference primary in Louisiana that time because he knew Jesse Jackson was gonna win, and he wanted to head the delegation so that he could broker the delegation to whoever the candidate was gonna be; ultimately it was--what was the guy's name?  Can't remember it.
Speaker 1: Ah--god, actually I should know this.  Was--Dukakis [Michael Dukakis]?
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, no, McGov--
Speaker 2: In '84 [1984], it was--
Speaker 1: McGovern [George McGovern].
Speaker 2: No, no, it was--he was vice president in Jimmy Carter's [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] --
Speaker 1: Mondale.
Speaker 2: Mondale--Walter Mondale, yeah.  It was ultimately Walter Mondale, but Edwards wanted to be able to broker the whole committee so he, he cancelled the presidential preference primary, so I filed suit, and the suit went all the way to the United States Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court ordered the State of Louisiana to have a presidential preference primary. Jesse Jackson won it, just as we thought, he got 60 some percent of the delegates, and when we had the first meeting of the delegates to elect the chairman of the delegation, Edwin Edwards put his name in, and the first meeting of the, of the delegation was in the governor's office in Baton Rouge [Louisiana] (laughter), so Edwin Edwards put his name in to be nominated as the chairman of the delegation.  I nominated Dutch to be chairman of the delegation, and I took the governor's podium from him (laughter), and argued that Dutch ought to be the chairperson of the delegation because the Jesse Jackson delegates won out.  But we had some turncoats in the Jesse Jackson delegation and they voted for Edwards and he won, I think, by two votes and was the chairperson of the delegation.  And then--
Speaker 1: This is even after the lawsuit?
Speaker 2: (Nods head) And then he only came to the convention for one day, and left (laughter).  So, Dutch ultimately was the leader of the delegation by default, because the governor didn't come. He came for one day and left.  So that was a, an interesting piece of litigation that was--that I was involved in and instrumental in, in getting Jesse those delegate votes in Louisiana.
Story_ID: 632081
Speaker 1: I was elected in 1982 with Dutch Morial [Ernest Morial] f- in his second term.  I served as sheriff for twenty-eight years; that was through the terms of Sidney Barthelemy, Marc Morial [HistoryMaker Marc H. Morial], and Ray Nagin.
Speaker 2: That's a lot of different people (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: So, can you talk about the, the--well, Marc Morial was like family--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --so can you talk about that, and then the other adminis- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, Marc was a teenager when his dad got elected, and he used to hang--
Speaker 2: So he was in that kitchen that night when he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he--no, no, he wasn't--no, he--
Speaker 2: Wasn't--he wasn't!
Speaker 1: No.  In fact, I think he was still away at school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He was going to Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] at the time.  It was Jacques [Jacques Morial], Monique [Monique Morial], Cheri [Cheri Morial], and Sybil [Sybil Haydel Morial], 'cause the oldest daughter [Julie Morial] was not there either; she was in California in medical school the--doing her residency.  Who did you ask me?
Speaker 2: Marc (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, Marc.  Marc was a, was a teenager when his dad first got elected and I, I watched Marc grow up and, and when Marc came back to New Orleans [Louisiana] after he got his law degree [from Georgetown University Law Center, Washington, D.C.], he went to work for a law firm and stayed there about a year and wasn't real crazy about it, so his daddy came to me and said, "Look, can you give Marc a job?  He's gonna leave the law firm that he's with."  And I said, "Sure."  And so Marc came in to the sheriff's office [of Orleans Parish, Louisiana] as the attorney for the sheriff's office and the auctioneer, and so for about four years, Marc was our attorney and our auctioneer in addition to being a good friend.  Then, he decided he wanted to run for [U.S.] Congress, Lindy Boggs' seat which came available, and he asked me to be his campaign manager and to introduce him at his inaugural--not his inaugural, but his, his announcement speech. And I did, and I was his campaign manager.  Unfortunately, he lost that campaign and he was kind of bitter about it because he wanted to be on the national level--always wanted to be on the national level. About two years later, he came back to me and said he thought he was gonna run for a state senate seat.  I said, "Great, let's do it."  So, he ran and, and--I'll never forget this.  We got down to--
Speaker 2: Now what year is this?  What year are these campaigns?
Speaker 1: I don't, I don't remember (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, no problem.
Speaker 1: (PAULA SAIZAN): It was after Dutch's death.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah; it was after Dutch's death, and Dutch died in '89 [1989], so it was in the early '90s [1990s]--probably '94 [1994], I think.  So, he ran for the seat and I remember he came to see me about a week and a half, two weeks before the election, and he said, "Look, I'm a little short of money," he said.  "I can--I think I can win this thing in the first primary; we can push it over the top, but I'm gonna need about fifty thousand dollars."  So I said, "No problem; let's do it."  So I called up one of my supporters and I said, "Hey, you need to come up with twenty-five and I need to come up with twenty-five," so we each--I had money in my campaign treasury so I wrote a check out of my campaign treasury to his campaign treasury, and my friend wrote a check for twenty-five and put him over the top, and he won the first primary.
Story_ID: 632082
Speaker 1: Marc [HistoryMaker Marc H. Morial] was a, a, a good friend and supporter in his time in the state legislature [Louisiana State Legislature], and, then after, after that first term in the legislature, Sidney's [Sidney Barthelemy] term had come to an end, and we were sitting down talking one day, and he asked me, he said, "Are you gonna run for mayor [of New Orleans, Louisiana]?"  And I said, "I'm thinking about it."  He said, "Why?" I said, "Why?"  He said, "Well, I'm thinking about it, too."  I said, "Well, I'll tell you what, Marc; if you want it, you can have it."  I said, "I'll do it if it need--if, if I've got to do it," I said, "but I've got a lot of other things that I need to do as well."  And so I said, "If you want it, go ahead, have it."  So he ran--and won--and served.
Speaker 2: Do you ever think if you had made the decision to run, or you think that was the right decision?
Speaker 1: For me, at that time, it was the right decision.  My children [Michelle Valteau and Collette Valteau] were still at home, I was raising them.  I could see that my parents were becoming ill health.
Speaker 2: 'Cause you said 1996, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  And in--sure enough, as it turned out, in '96 [1996] my mother [Udine Davis Valteau] died, and I discovered that my dad [Paul R. Valteau, Sr.] was sicker than I knew.  He had Parkinson's and he had some other problems and, and I wound up having to be a caregiver, and family is extremely important to me and, and that, that was where my service needed to be at that point in time, and I think that my children are better for it; I know that my, my parents appreciated what I did.  And no, I don't regret the sacrifice because I don't believe in regretting and repeating, and things like that.  He did what he had to do, I did what, what was my calling to do.  I think I could have done as, as good a job had I been mayor, as he did--maybe better.  But, you know, he's gone on to a, a great career and I'm happy for him; I'm proud of him.  He is a mentee.  Just as I was Dutch's [Ernest Morial] mentee, he is my mentee and, and he surpassed me--what I did in life, and I'm hap- I think it's great--wonderful!   I'm happy to be able to say that a New Orleanian is running the Urban League of the United States, the National Urban League and, and that he's someone I knew, and that he's someone that I had some input into his life, so that's wonderful.  That's--I think that's what life is all about.
Speaker 2: So that's like--'cause there haven't been that many African American political legacies in that way, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, no.  He's one of the few, yeah, yeah, might be the only one--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --as far as I know--
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: --where father-son--
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --did the same thing, yeah, yeah.  I'm sure his dad's very proud of him as well.
Story_ID: 632083
Speaker 1: So then you--then Reagan--Nagin [Ray Nagin] followed.
Speaker 2: Nagin followed Morial [HistoryMaker Marc H. Morial].
Speaker 1: And that--the--remember you were saying earlier that that was one of the f- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --only ti- it was the only time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that's because Nagin was the white community's candidate.  Richard Pennington, who was the police chief--I'll tell you an interesting story about that.  Marc Morial had won, and he was in transition and he called me up and he said, "I gotta make a decision on a police chief."  I said, "Yeah, I know."  He says, "Well, I got these three candidates," and he said, "I'm really looking at one strongly, but," he said, "I'll tell you what.  I want you to go up to Washington, D.C. and meet with this guy and tell me what you think."  So I said, "Sure, I'll be happy to do that."  So I went up to D.C. and I met Richard Pennington; had never met him before in life.  We rode around--I rode around with him all day for one day; we ate lunch, ate dinner, talked.  So at the end of the night when he dropped me off back at the hotel, he said, he said to me, he said, "What do you think I should do?"  I said, "Richard, I don't know; I can't tell you what you, what you should do," I said, "but I will tell you what will happen if you take the job of police chief of New Orleans [Louisiana]."  He said, "Well, what is that?"  I said, "There's only one of two things that can happen, Richard."  I said, "You're either gonna become the hottest property in the policing business, or you're gonna be out of the policing business."  As it turned out, he became the hottest property in policing business and eventually got the police chief in Atlanta [Georgia] and, and was considered for a number of positions at the national level before he decided to take the police chief's position in Atlanta.  So, that, that was just an interesting side, side note.
Story_ID: 632084
Speaker 1: But, back to where you were.
Speaker 2: I was--I was talking about Nagin [Ray Nagin] (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, Nagin, Nagin--yeah, Nagin--Nagin ran against Pennington [Richard Pennington].  Pennington was the black community's candidate but, but Pennington just didn't have the--he, he had never been in politics before. He'd always been a policeman, and he just didn't have the political charisma that it takes to, to win an election. And so Nagin won with the large backing of the white community and they really felt--I, I know that there were literally celebrations in some of the upper class white neighborhoods when Nagin won because they felt like they had, they had their guy, and the first four years in office, he acted like he was their guy; he, he appointed predominantly whites to boards and commissions, he attacked the Morial administration every chance he could. He hated Marc Morial [HistoryMaker Marc H. Morial]. Why, I don't know. Because Marc Morial had allowed him, in a group that he had become aligned with, to bring a hockey team to town and operate in the Municipal Auditorium [New Orleans, Louisiana] rent free for two years, and he was the, the chairman of the, of the hockey team.  But for some reason, he didn't like Marc Morial.  So he was, was the white community's candidate, and for the first four years, acted very much as the white community's dupe, and carried out their mission.  He attacked black organizations, he attacked black ministers, he attacked everything in the black community, and--
Speaker 2: Can we talk about the, the significance of that in the, in the historical context of black administrations and black mayors?  So, in your discussion about this, not even--I mean Marc was family in many ways, but did Marc represent--so he was the third black mayor--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, two others serving, so that would be fifth term, right?  So--but there was--would some say that he was elected because of the love for Dutch Morial [Ernest Morial]?  Would that be it?  Or was it a legacy, like we have the legacy here of the Daleys in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: I think it was a combination of things.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I think it was a combination of the love of his father, as well as the, the, the legacy, as well as some frustration with the previous mayor.
Speaker 2: Now, what were the frustrations with the previous--
Speaker 1: The frustrations with the previous mayor was--the previous mayor being Sidney Barthelemy--was that, to a very small extent, Sidney had been sort of the hand picked white candidate--white community's candidate again.
Speaker 2: So--oh, so went black, white, black, white then.
Speaker 1: Except that in each case, when it came time to their--for their second term in office, they got slapped in the face by the white electorate, and then realized that if they were going to have a successful mayoralship, they had better get on--as James Brown says, "Get on the good foot" and connect back with their base community.  And so in Sidney's term, he had the ability in his second term to correct--do a course correction, so to speak, and, and reconnect with his base community and salvage his mayoralship.
Story_ID: 632085
Speaker 1: Nagin tried, but I think in, in the main, was unsuccessful.  Although it was, it was sort of almost a maternalistic approach that the black community took towards him at the end, whereas you say, "He ain't the best in the world, but he's mine, and don't mess with him."  It's sort of the approach that the black community took towards Nagin in the end.
Speaker 2: So you're saying after Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] that's, that's the approach they took.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Are you talking about after Katrina (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, I'm talking about--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I'm talking about the black community after Katrina (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, okay.
Speaker 1: --took that approach toward Nagin because Nagin tried to reach out.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He, he was, he was beat up pretty good by the white community and they, they were feeling so empowered after the election of Nagin that they just, just went back to being public and honest about what their ultimate plans were.  One of the, one of the most shocking things I've ever seen is four days after Katrina hit in New Orleans [Louisiana], a group of white businessmen held a--from New Orleans held a meeting in Dallas [Texas] and brought Ray Nagin into the meeting and they told him what New Orleans was gonna look like after Katrina--told him what New Orleans was gonna look like after Katrina, and they were boastful enough about it that they let a, a Wall Street Journal reporter in the meeting; there was a big article in The Wall Street Journal about it.
Speaker 2: And what did they say about that New Orleans?
Speaker 1: They said that--that the new New Orleans was going to be a smaller city, and it was going to have no minorities.  And it was going to be a tourist destination, and that was it.  And they weren't gonna have all these poor people, they weren't gonna have all these housing projects, they weren't gonna have all this underclass as they had prior to New Orleans, and that the school system was gonna be different and government was gonna be different.  And while there was a lot of noise and a lot of effort to reverse that, as I sit here today, they're pretty much accomplishing their goal.
Speaker 2: I was gonna ask that--it seemed like it was prophetic.
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: So, this was not the New Orleans that--so, I wanna talk about that because--did you wanna say, say something?  Did you--okay.
Speaker 1: (PAULA SAIZAN):  No, I was just reminding him that Nagin supported Jindal [Bobby Jindal] governor openly--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (PAULA SAIZAN):  --that--and, and the school situation and the vision of these power brokers in Dallas.  They decided--not decided, they took over the schools--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (PAULA SAIZAN):  --(simultaneous) fired all the teachers, and--
Story_ID: 632086
Speaker 1: Let's go back, though, to, to, to--let--can you talk about the pluses and minuses of each administration?  Can you do that for me?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Dutch's [Ernest Morial] administration was the door opener, so it had a lotta big pluses and it had a very few minuses.  The big pluses were the fact that he was there, that he opened the door, that there were African Americans in positions that they had never been in before.  The other big plus is that he then became the leader of politics in the city, and you saw people like Revius Ortique [HistoryMaker Revius Oliver Ortique, Jr.] who had harbored an interest in being a judge his entire legal career but just never had the wherewithal to put it together.  (Claps hands) Instantly, Revius Ortique was a judge, and accelerated his judicial position to become the first African American on Louisiana's state supreme court [Louisiana Supreme Court].  The minuses were that the, the hopes of the black community were so high, and it's a problem that all first-time African American officials have, that they're, they're unmeetable--you can't deliver at the level that the African community hopes and expects to deliver at, and therefore, there becomes some disappointment.  So it was, it was that situation.  It wasn't big time disappointment, but there was little disappointment.  And there was frustration on the part of, of Dutch's side, being unable to contribute even though he campaigned, much of the time he campaigned, his favorite line was, "I'm going to--," let's see, how did he put it?  "I'm going to promise meagerly, and deliver extravagantly," which was one of his favorite sayings he used to say at--whenever he was talking to groups of people.  But even as such--and, and the other, the other negative was that the white community never accepted him; he faced battles throughout his eight year term in--with the white community at, at various stages and at various points over various things.  I mentioned the, the convention center thing.  There was another one that involved Audubon Park [New Orleans, Louisiana] where you had--people who lived along Audubon Park, because it wasn't completely fenced in, just started occupying the government property and treating it as if it was their own property, so he changed the number of members on the board and kicked all those people off, and as a result of that, they started a big fight--filed a lawsuit and everything, and one--another situation was there was a, a fellow who, who came in to support Dutch in his reelection bid, and contributed money, who was a businessman who operated a business at the airport [New Orleans International Airport; Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, New Orleans, Louisiana]--a limousine business--and he hadn't paid rent in eight years because he was in a dispute with the airport, and he expected Dutch to forgive the rent when the suit was over, and because Dutch refused to, he absolutely took a vendetta out against Dutch, hated Dutch; did everything he could to hurt him and defeat him. Everything.  So, it was a, a bittersweet time in the second four years of his administration because these things started to happen in rapid succession, and it made it difficult to, to just govern because you always had to deal with these fights over here where the white community was trying to take back the power.
Story_ID: 632087
Speaker 1: The Sidney Barthelemy administration, which followed, was again a high because we maintained the fact that an African American succeeded an African American in the, in the mayor's position.  I, I think that the big downer in the Barthelemy administration is that he capitulated too much of the, the interest of the white community and gave back many of the gains that had been won through the Morial [Ernest Morial] administration--first Morial administration.  But in the end, Sidney realized his position and reconnected with the black community and, and began to fight for the things that he had given away earlier and tried to win 'em back.
Story_ID: 632088
Speaker 1: Along comes Marc Morial [HistoryMaker Marc H. Morial], and he was sort of a different kind of leader because he was younger and had been through a different experience, but he was more militant than Sidney [Sidney Barthelemy], and the white community was just shocked at his militance, and he--
Speaker 2: After he got in office, you mean.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  And he immediately set about restoring and adding on to the gains that, that had been made during his father's [Ernest Morial] term in office, ergo the airport situation that I told you about, and a number of other situations.  He was very adamant that African Americans were gonna participate in government and in government contracting in large measure, not in insignificant token participation, but in large measure. And he set about to see that that happened.  And much of the negativism that took place after he left office revolved around that whole situation, the fact that he stood up for African Americans and stood up for the fact that African Americans needed to participate fully in government, and the white community hated it and did everything they could to, to keep him from succeeding, and after he left office did everything they could to try to put him in jail.  (Laughter) I'll never forget one of the, one of the silliest things I ever saw was the U.S. attorney's office standing on the foot of the steps of, of his building after several months of this investigation when they had just raided Jacques Morial's house at seven o'clock in the morning with no notice, and Marc Morial's law office.  And they asked him, "Are, are you out to get former mayor Marc Morial?"  "Absolutely not, we're just following the evidence."  Well, they had no evidence on Jacques Morial. What they had was a theory, and here's what their theory was.  Jacques Morial is a fan of Caribbean music and other things that you get in the, in the Caribbean. And--art, culture, and that kind of stuff.  And he would go to the Caribbean maybe as often as once a month.  In their twisted minds, they believed that Jacques Morial was carrying briefcases full of money to the Caribbean to deposit in banks, on behalf of his brother, every time he went to the Caribbean.  So they broke into Jacques' house to try to find some evidence of his transferring funds on behalf of Marc. There wasn't any evidence; the only thing they found was that he hadn't paid his taxes (laughter) in two years, so they fined him fif- five years later, they fined him fifteen hundred dollars for non-payment of taxes and made him stay under house arrest for six months I think it was.  In, in Marc's situation, they found nothing; they raided his law office and found nothing, and were unable to do anything. So it--you know, it--again it's, it's an example of the thing that I was mentioning earlier that--how once you choose to become an African American elected official, you are under the, the scrutiny of the federal government and its, its employees, and they do everything they can to try to entrap you into criminal behavior.
Story_ID: 632089
Speaker 1: Did that ever happen to you?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Give examples.
Speaker 2: The first time it happened, I was in office for less than six months.  A group of people came to me and they wanted to change a zoning on a building that had been built on St. Charles Avenue, and they wanted to hire me to be their lawyer.  I told 'em, "I'm, I'm not--I'm not practicing law anymore; I just got elected sheriff [of Orleans Parish, Louisiana]."  "Well, can you help us?"  I said, "As a citizen who asked for my help, I'll be happy to do anything legally to help you, but I'm not gonna represent you, I'm not gonna be your lawyer."  So they said, "Well, well, what are you gonna do?"  And I said, "Well, that's up to you to tell me.  I'm the public official; if you want me to do something, you have to ask me and if--I'll make a decision whether it's legal or not.  If I can do it, I will; if I can't, I won't."  So they left.  Never heard from 'em again.  Got a call one day from the lawyer who was representing 'em.  He said, "Listen, I, I wanna come over and talk to you."  So I said, "Fine."  He came over, he said, "I just want you to know that I'm charging them $150,000 and I'm gonna split that $150,000 with you."  I said, "No, you're not."  He said, "Well, yeah; if you represent 'em--." I said, "I told you before, I'm not representing them, I'm not representing you, I have nothing to do with this project.  Please get out of my office."  He left.  On the Monday of Thanksgiving week of 1982, my phone rings in my office; it's six, six o'clock in the evening.  I was in my office working.  My mother [Udine Davis Valteau] called.  She said, "What did you do?"  I said, "What do you mean what did I do?"  She says, "I'm watching the news and they said you're under investigation for extortion."  I said, "What?"  (Laughter) And I started laughing.  She said, "You better not laugh; this is serious."  I said, "You're right it's serious.  I've never practiced criminal law; I don't even know what extortion is" (laughter).  I said, "When I hang up talking to you, I gotta go to the law library and look up extortion."  So I hung up, I went to the library, I looked it up.  I said, "I never did anything like this; I don't know what they're talking about."  So, about three days later--no, a week later, this lawyer comes into--calls me and asks if he could come and see me again, so I said, "Sure, come on over."  So he brings this briefcase, puts it on my desk, pops it open, and it's full a cash.  He says, "This is your fifty thousand."  I said, "Close that briefcase and get out of my office, but before you leave, let me just make sure you understand this.  I never worked for these people, I was never their attorney, I made no phone calls, I had no conversations with anyone.  I don't know anything about this project, and I have never agreed to take 50 percent of your legal fee. Now leave!"  He got out, and my office was on the fourth floor on the street side, so I had a window that I could view the street.  I watched him get in a car, and as the car drove off, it had a federal government license plate on the back of it.  Three days later, a commissioner from the planning commission was arrested and charged with bribery.  He hired a guy who had taught me in law school [Loyola University New Orleans College of Law, New Orleans, Louisiana], and who I had gotten honors in his course in law school, to represent him.  About six months later, I saw that guy and he told me--says--he says, he says, "You know they were trying to get you."  I said, "I had an idea."  He said, "No, no, no, no, let me tell you what happened."  He said, "They arrested my client at two o'clock in the afternoon and they held him at the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] office and they told him, 'You give us information on Dutch Morial [Ernest Morial], Reynard Rochon,'" who was the chief administrative officer, "'Jim Singleton,'" who was a city councilman--black city councilman, "'or Paul Valteau [HistoryMaker Paul R. Valteau, Jr.], and we will drop the charges against you.'"  I said, "Really?" He said, "Yeah."  I said, "Okay."
Story_ID: 632090
Speaker 1: So, I started the reserve deputy association, and basically, I started the reserve deputy association because I wanted to have an organization where the school talk program could be in, housed in, and could work from?  Well, with that reserve deputy association, over the twenty-eight years that I was the sheriff [of Orleans Parish, Louisiana], we probably did twenty thou- $20 million worth of services in the City of New Orleans [Louisiana]; we did volunteer work with the schools, we did volunteer work with the United Way [United Way Worldwide], we did volunteer work with the National Council of Negro Women, we did volunteer work with the United Negro College Fund, we did volunteer work with a whole myriad of social service organizations in the city.  But in order to be a member of the reserve deputy association, you had to pay a hundred dollars dues.  Hundred dollars dues got you a membership card and an invite to the twelve meetings we had a year where we had speakers come in to speak, and we'd serve refreshments after, which we would pay--and then we would use the majority of the money to deal with these activities and events that we had, like the, the programs that we were putting on.  Well, a guy comes into the office and says he wants to join the reserve deputy program, so the receptionist brings him to my secretary and my secretary says, "Well, you have to go see Miss Young [ph.]."  She, she was the person that I had who was in charge of the program who kept the books on it and everything.  And this, this guy says, "No, I wanna see the sheriff; I wanna give my money to him."  So, my secretary said, "Well, okay, I'll, I'll, I'll see if he can see you."  So, she comes and she tells me.  I said, "Unh-uh.  Tell him to see Miss Young; Miss Young'll take his money.  I don't see people when they joining the association."  So he insisted that he wanted to see me and, and she said, "No, I'm sorry."  So he tells her, "I got a five thousand dollar check for him."  And she, she came back in, she says, "The man says he has a five thousand dollar check for you."  I said, "I'm not doing fundraising right now, and it costs a hundred dollars to join the reserve deputies, not five thousand dollars."  So she went out and told him that, and I said, "Tell him to see Miss Young."  So he went and joined with Miss Young, came to a meeting, and tried to give me a check at the meeting.  "I don't take checks, sorry."  Well, that happened again about a year later.  Well, about five years after that, I get a call from a guy who's in jail in Pennsylvania.  He says, "I wanna talk to the sheriff."  My secretary said, "Well, who are you?"  He gives his name, she doesn't recognize it; she says, "You wanna talk--?" I said, "Yeah, I'll talk to him; I don't know who he is."  I get on the phone, he says, "Look, you don't know me."  He says, "You knew me under an assumed name when I was in your reserve deputy association."  He says, "I'm in jail in Pennsylvania now," he said, "but I just want you to know what was going on."  He said, "I was an informant for the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], and they put me in your reserve deputy association because they wanted me to give you money so they could charge you with bribery because they thought you were taking money--that you were getting the money out of the reserve deputy association."  I said, "Man, I'm not that cheap; I don't come that cheap" (laughter).  I said, "I'm not gonna take any money out of the reserve deputy association; it never was set up for that."  So he said, "Well, I just wanted you to know."  So at least on three occasions they tried me, yeah.  And I have had people who have gone to testify before grand juries about a variety of subjects and, and they have asked them questions about me.
Story_ID: 632091
Speaker 1: Can you talk about the fact--you know, your--why it was historic.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My, my elec- are we on?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My election was historic because I was the first African American elected sheriff in a southern state since Reconstruction.  There was a sheriff in Louisiana that I know of during the Reconstruction period, but since Reconstruction, there had not been an indivi- an African American individual elected sheriff in the South until my election, so I was the first; now there are many.  I would guess that there probably twenty-five sheriffs in the Deep South; there are, there are at least four in Louisiana, so I'm figuring if four in Louisiana, there're probably four in every southern state, and that would multiply out to about twenty-five across the South.
Story_ID: 632092
Speaker 1: Why did you decide to, to retire?  You had done it for twenty-eight years (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Twenty-eight years, yeah.  I, I had--I had maxed out in my--a, a number of reasons why I retired.  I had maxed out in my pension system, so I couldn't do any, any more in there.  I felt like I had done everything that needed to be done to bring the office to the 21st century.  I had reconstructed the office after Katrina [Hurricane Katrina]. And Katrina took an awful lot out, out of me--more than I want to admit, quite frankly.  And I was, I was getting tired, and there were other things I wanted to do in life, and I wanted to pursue--I wanted to get back into the law practice again and try that out again.  I wanted to pursue the new business avenues that I was looking at with my partner [Ruth Ann Menutis], and I wanted to have more free time to spend with my wife [Paula Saizan] and my family, and so I, I put all of those things together and I said, "You know, maybe this is the time."  In addition to that, the Louisiana legislature [Louisiana State Legislature] had ordered a merger of a number of offices in the, in the City of New Orleans [Louisiana].  At the time, we had two sheriffs offices, two clerks offices, and two court systems, and the Louisiana legislature has--had ordered, as a result of Katrina, that all of that be merged into one.  Well, the, the processes of merging were long and extensive, and I had no interest in going through that.  The two sheriffs--basically, I did all the functions of a normal sheriff except house the prisoners.  We had a fellow who was called sheriff, who actually was a jailer--the city jailer--and he housed all the prisoners, and the prison complex, the jail complex, had grown to a vast complex; there were literally nine buildings and sixty-five hundred people in prison at any given time, and a staff of over fifteen hundred people.  And the fellow who was there is the one who had built that system from one jail and eight hundred people and nine hundred prisoners, to sixty-five hundred prisoners, nine buildings, and fifteen hundred staff.  He decided to run for attorney general and he won (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) His name?  His name?
Speaker 2: Name was Charles Foti, and he decided to run for attorney general and, and he won, and he wanted me to run for the position--for his position.  And I looked at it a long time, but it was not an increase in pay; it was a lateral move, and I had already maxed out in my pension system, and there weren't gonna be any more salary increases coming.  So, evaluating that, as well as how much Katrina had taken out of me, the bitterness that I had towards the community--the, the City of New Orleans, the fact that there were other things I wanted to do, the fact that I wanted to--I had gotten married and I wanted to spend more time with my wife and family, I just thought that it was a, a coming together of a lot of factors that made it in my best interest to move forward with the next phase of my life.  And I had trained Marlin Gusman [Marlin N. Gusman]; he was an attorn- he became an attorney in my office after Marc [HistoryMaker Marc H. Morial] left, and I had trained him in the position and prepared him to ultimately take the role.  He went off and, and won a city council seat and sat at the city council [New Orleans City Council] for three years, but his basic training had been in the sheriff's office [of Orleans Parish, Louisiana], and I thought that if I wasn't going to take the position that Foti had, that I could hand pick my success- a successor for that position, and I did and I put Marlin Gusman in that position.  And then when the legislature merged the two offices, it became a situation of do I want to run for that seat, or do I want to listen to all of these other things that are happening in my life and move in a different direction?  And I would have certainly won; I was considered the leading candidate.  And when I evaluated where I was in my life, and all the things that I had to do, I said, "Maybe it's time to move."  And so I called Marlin up and I said, "Hey, man, why don't you run for--?" No, I said--I told him--that was when I told him to run for the position.  And then when that legislative session came up, before the end of my term, after I had regenerated the office, I called him up and I said, "Marlin, I think it's time to merge the sheriff's office into one, and I think I've trained you to hold that position, so I'm gonna go to the legislature and I'm gonna merge the two offices."  And he said, "Fine, if that's what you wanna do."  So, I merged 'em, and I moved on in life, and I'm happy about it.

Speaker 1: I'm pleased with where I am and what I'm doing, and--
Speaker 2: And your practice--let's talk about--'cause it--that's a long time not to be practicing law (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.  I'm, I'm slowly getting back into the swing of things.
Speaker 2: Back into it?
Speaker 1: It's, it's, it's not something--I have, I have a couple of big cases that I'm working on.  I've got one of the, one of the BP oil [BP P.L.C.] cases that I'm working on, and I have a, a, a challenge that I have to the traffic camera system, which is not something that you all have here, so those are a couple of big cases that--you do have it here?
Speaker 2: (Inaudible response).
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  Oh, I'm challenging it in, in New Orleans [Louisiana] and, and I'm enjoying it.  I'm enjoying the practice of law. It, it has activated a, a side of my mental capacity that had been dormant for a number of years, so it's--you know, it's given me the ability to, to think again because the sheriff's office [of Orleans Parish, Louisiana] had become rote pretty much for me.
Story_ID: 632094
Speaker 1: The other thing I discovered--I realized, was that if New Orleans [Louisiana] was gonna have a chance at coming back, it was gonna have to be through the in- through the involvement of major sporting events and activities, and so I, I, for a number of years, had been on the Greater New Orleans Sports Foundation, and after Katrina [Hurricane Katrina], they came to me and asked me if I could take over as chairman of the New Orleans Bowl, and I did do that.  And at the time, it was teetering on, on failure--or not failure, but it was teetering on, on profitability; it was losing money every year prior to that.  I took over at the five year period, and in the five years that I was chairman of the, of the New Orleans Bowl, it turned a profit each year, and it has now become solidly entrenched in the bowl system, and its attendance has gone from five thousand to an average of about thirty thousand patrons every year come to the game.  I, I did that by going out to the universities, traveling to the universities, speaking on the campuses, tell- meeting with the presidents of the universities explaining to them that this is their game, this is their opportunity to showcase their talent, and recently the sports foundation has asked me to chair the whole sports foundation, so I'm in the second year of chairing the whole sports foundation, and we have been successful in putting together a bid for the Men's Final Four [NCAA Final Four], the Super Bowl [Super Bowl XLVII] in 2013, and the Women's Final Four.  We just finished the, the Junior Olympics--AAU Junior Olympics [AAU Junior Olympic Games], and we're constantly bidding on major events.  So with that organization, I'm--I believe that I'm fulfilling my commitment to serve my community by continuing to bring in major sporting events.  And the way I got into this is becau- the New Orleans Bowl was so important to me because when I was in college [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana], when I wasn't doing all the other stuff I was doing, I was working part time as a waiter in restaurants and hotels in downtown New Orleans, and I particularly remember, during the Christmas season, how the wait staff would always complain that there was nobody in town, and you couldn't make any money, and you couldn't really buy any nice Christmas gifts for anybody because you didn't have any money, so the opportunity to, to take charge of this game which took place in New Orleans the weekend before Christmas just played right into my history and my background, and so I gave it every effort that I could because I understood how important it was to the waiters, the bartenders, the cab drivers, the maids, the--all of the people in the service industry in New Orleans.  So we went from a point where we had only two hotels, and we had maybe five or six thousand people coming to town that weekend before Christmas.  Last year we had five hotels that were committing space to us, and we had fifteen to eighteen thousand people come to town for that weekend.  And so I think that that was a, a great accomplishment for those little people that I still could equate to--after all these experiences and all these years, that still, still are important to me because they're the backbone of the community.

Speaker 1: I was quoted in The New York Times back during Katrina [Hurricane Katrina].  A reporter asked me why was I so upset, and I said, "I'm upset because the people that you see out there on that interstate, living for the last three days, are the people that drive you in from the airport, that make up your bed in your hotel room, that serve you your dinner in your restaurant, and that bring you your drinks in your bar, and they pay taxes, and they're being ignored, and that has hurt me deeply 'cause I was one of those people, and probably could be one of those people again, were it not for my parents [Udine Davis Valteau and Paul R. Valteau, Sr.] and, and the education that I have gotten over the years."
Speaker 2: So your heart is really as a civic person all up and down, all up and down.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: So, can you talk a little bit about--'cause you did talk about Katrina, but what took it out of you?  I mean it was--first of all, you had to--everybody kicked into action, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, well we did search and rescue--we did about five days of search and rescue, we did all of the things that had to be done.  I've seen death and dying and, and I think the thing that took it out of me was that I, I lost my respect for, for the United States, first of all; secondly, I gained a huge amount of fear.  I'm, I'm very afraid that we are unprepared for anything that might befall one of our major cities, and I think I, I got an understanding of how precarious our economic situation is--not just our economic situation, our entire situation is.  I watched anarchy, I watched the community go from government to lawlessness and to anarchy in a matter of about twelve hours, and that's frightening, that's very, very frightening.  And I saw the inability--I don't know if it was so much the inability or the don't care of our nation to just ignore these people that were sitting out there on the interstate.  I had many tearful moments during that time where I, you know, just couldn't--I couldn't deal with it, and it was heartbreaking and, you know, it--it's very upsetting to think about it and to talk about it even today; it's, it's not something that I enjoy, and I think because of those experiences I just had my fill.  The other thing was that I always felt, as I was sheriff, that I could always do something to help people, and I never felt more helpless in my life as that week after Katrina, and I just said, you know, "Why do it?"
Story_ID: 632096
Speaker 1: Now, New Orleans [Louisiana].  We were talking, before we started the taping, about the New Orleans that is there now.  And I had heard someone say that they--that it's like the gut of the black community has been--
Speaker 2: Gone?
Speaker 1: Gone.
Speaker 2: Gone, yeah.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: The rich are richer, the poor are poorer, and there is no middle class.  And--
Speaker 1: Are the rich black as well as white?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh; the rich are exclusively white.  There, there is not--New Orleans, New Orleans happily calls itself a tourist destination.  There are no African Americans in the tourist business; we don't own a hotel.  We only have one, maybe two restaurants that we are famous for in New Orleans, and that's it.  We don't even own a cab company anymore; we're just workers.  And, and that's not by accident; it's like--I, I told a, a, a business leader once--it was a committee formed up to try to help the school system, and they came and asked me to join it, and I said, "Why?"  Said, "Well, we gotta do something."  I said, "Wait a minute; let, let me explain something to you."  I said, "I've traveled the country and I've seen other cities, and I know in other cities the business community is very actively involved with the school system because the product that comes out at the end of that pipeline is important to them because that was--that is what makes their city successful."  I said, "You are absolutely happy with what's coming out at the end of the public school system in New Orleans because that's exactly what you need, uneducated people who can be maids, bartenders, waiters, cab drivers and the like; that's all you want.  So you're not here to improve the school system. You wanna make sure that you don't lose what's coming out of that pipeline."  And I said, "That's not what I'm here for, so we don't--we can't be on a--I can't be on the same committee with you 'cause we're at opposite purposes."
Speaker 1: So, the black community--what is the size now?  What is the size of New Orleans now?
Speaker 2: They say that there are 330,000 people in New Orleans now.  I find it hard pressed to come up with 225,000.  The majority of it is African American, but they're the underclass; they're, they're not successful people. They're the poor, and it's, it's gonna be extremely difficult for that city to succeed with that situation existing.  The taxes are higher; everything is higher.  My wife [Paula Saizan] tells me all the time when she's in New Orleans, that everything is more expensive in New Orleans than it is in Houston [Texas] and she's right.  Taxes are unbelievably high--property taxes are unbelievably high, the services are absolutely minimal, there are disruptions in the services all the time.  We--you know, we have problems with the water, problems with sewers, you have--crime is, is high, so it's a tough place to survive right now.
Story_ID: 632097
Speaker 1: What then is the, the legacy of the black community in the situation it's in today (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's, that's the sad part.  Other than the music and the culture, there is no legacy.  All the--and that's--I guess that's--
Speaker 1: That's a, that's a harsh statement.
Speaker 2: It is a harsh statement and I, I guess that's the thing that breaks my heart the, the most, and I think about all the years that I worked in the civil rights era, all the years that I worked in the political era; all together it's probably more than forty, forty-five years that I worked to try to better the place that I live, that I call home, and it took twelve hours, less than one day, to reverse forty-five years of work because the, the, the city has gone back to what it was.  There, there only two citywide black elected officials now--the sheriff and the assessor, and the sheriff is gonna be hard put to win reelection next time.  There is a conscious and concerted effort to un-elect every black public official in the city, and they've been successful at it thus far, so it's gone for naught.  One of the things that, that I did not understand until I got well involved into the political system and elective office is that the political system in New Orleans [Louisiana] does not control New Orleans; the economic system controls New Orleans and we're not a part of the economic system.  And I don't know if that's the same way in any other city, but that's the way it is in New Orleans, and we're not part of that-- we're particularly excluded from that economic system, so much so that we had a chamber of commerce [New Orleans Chamber of Commerce], and there were too many African Americans joining the chamber of commerce, so the big white businesses started, started another organization called Greater New Orleans, Inc., and that organization only has one African American in it, and they left the chamber of commerce in existence for the black folk.  So you have the chamber of commerce which is majority black, and you have Greater New Orleans, Inc. which really has the power, which only has one African American on it, and he's there because he heads the energy company in the city.  So.
Story_ID: 632098
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask one last question, and can you tell me the New Orleans [Louisiana] that you came from, and I'm talking about the black New Orleans.  The New Orleans that you came from and the New Orleans that you grew so much to love, and miss so much.  Can you tell me, can you describe it for me?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was a wonderful place; it was a nurturing community, it was a community that, that loved life, that loved itself, that had a sense of its--of who it was; it was a community filled with, with vibrance, businesses, opportunity. It was a community that had a lot of artists, great celebrations, great, great families and, and great family histories and, and backgrounds and, and--a great place.
Speaker 1: Give me the sights, smells and sounds of that New Orleans.
Speaker 2: The sights are the, the oak lined Claiborne Avenue, which is now covered by an interstate; the smells are all the wonderful Creole cooking--Miss Chase's [HistoryMaker Leah "Dookie" Chase] gumbo, Austin Leslie's fried chicken--just all of the great sounds; all, all of the, the clubs and organizations that existed in New Orleans.  Smells, sights, and--what else?  Sounds (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sounds.
Speaker 2: Sounds.  The sounds are--oh, just the wonderful music.  I--being a musician, a former musician myself, it--just great, great music.  Music everywhere.  The music was so ubiquitous that there was also--almost a musical lilt in your step in New Orleans--in, in, in the communities--in the neighborhoods.  Just a wonderful place.  Great place to grow up.  And a place that has produced great people who are all over America today.  A New Orleanian runs the White House now--an African American New Orleanian, Rochon--Comman- Rear Admiral Rochon [HistoryMaker Rear Admiral Stephen Rochon], I believe?  He's--classmate of mine.  His brother [Gilbert Rochon] is now the president of Tuskegee University--Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  So there're African Americans from New Orleans all over.  The first black mayor of Oakland, California--Wilson [Lionel Wilson] was his name--New Orleans.  (Pause) It was a great place, and it nurtured a lot of great people.
