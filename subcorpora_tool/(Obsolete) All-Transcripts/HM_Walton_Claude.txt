Speaker 1: What were some of the earliest sights and sounds that you remember from your childhood?
Speaker 2: Well, growing up in Denver [Colorado] back in the teens [1910s] and the '20s [1920s], there wasn't too much to remember.  I remember that the--that the street in front of the house still was not paved and the alleys weren't paved.  There were no unusual sounds because the automobiles were few and far between, so there was no horn honking or, or noise from motors.  There were certainly no televisions and electronic devices of that nature, so it was a fairly quiet early beginning.  And I remember that the major activity on Sunday afternoon was to go down to the baseball field on 24th [Street] and California Street and watch the baseball game.
Speaker 1: Was this a local baseball (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A little local team, yes, yes.  The, the local team was sort of organized by my uncle and they were known as the White Elephants.
Speaker 1: What was your uncle's name?  What was your uncle's name?
Speaker 2: James Woolridge.
Speaker 1: So that would have been on your mother's [Jennie Woolridge Walton] side?
Speaker 2: On my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What were some of the earliest smells that you remember around your home where--
Speaker 2: Really I don't have any recollection of any particular smell since we didn't--we didn't have any--we didn't have any ethnic foods that we--that were cooked that gave off any particular smell, so it was sort of just a common smell.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite season?
Speaker 2: Really, winter.  I like the cold weather.  Spring and fall are good.  Summer is hot and miserable.  I sweat, literally sweat, not perspire, but sweat and that gives me an uncomfortable feeling, so I hate the summers.
Speaker 1: And what's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: I don't have any.

Speaker 1: My name is Tom Jefferson [Thomas Jefferson].  I'm with The HistoryMakers and today we're interviewing [HistoryMaker] Claude Walton.  Mr. Walton, could you state your name and spell it and where this interview is taking place?
Speaker 2: Claude Walton, C-L-A-U-D-E, W-A-L-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: And do you have a middle name or a middle initial?
Speaker 2: Alex, A-L-E-X.
Speaker 1: And could you tell us where this interview is taking place?

Speaker 1: And the date today?
Speaker 2: Eight--11/04/08, November 4, 1908--or, or 2008 [November 4, 2008].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, Mr. Walton, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Retired.
Speaker 1: And what, what are you retired from?  Where were you working?
Speaker 2: I worked forty-five years for the Chicago Park District.  I retired as associate superintendent, 1988.
Speaker 1: And what, what did associate superintendent do?
Speaker 2: My major responsibility was the, the--I was the coordinator for the school park program that was--involved the Chicago Board of Education.  It was a program in which the park district used the board of ed recreational facilities for after school programs.  These facilities in most instances were located in areas where there were no Chicago [Illinois] park facilities available.  And to provide the necessary recreational programs for the community, we would take over the school facilities after school closed and conduct programs for the community in those buildings, which were staffed by the board of ed but supervised by Chicago Park District personnel.
Speaker 1: Now, this interview is being conducted because you were involved in a particular activity.  Can you give us a little background about, about that?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess all of my young life was spent in, in sports and so I sort of naturally fell into the sports or recreational field after I graduated and I started out with the Chicago Park District as a physical education instructor, conducting programs in the gymnasium for--gymnasiums for all age group of boys from, from midgets to adults.  And these programs involved various physical activities, recreational activities.
Speaker 1: Prior to the park district, you were honored or distinguished in a certain area?
Speaker 2: I was a discus thrower with the--for the University of Colorado at--located at Boulder, Colorado [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado].  I threw the discus 157'4", 157 feet 4 inches, and that was good enough to win me a gold medal in 1935 at the national intercollegiate track meet held in Berkeley, California [1935 NCAA Track and Field Championships].
Speaker 1: Now, you were recently honored by the university.
Speaker 2: Yes, two weeks ago, literally two weeks ago, the university voted me into the Colorado University Hall of Fame [University of Colorado Athletic Hall of Fame].  I was the first All-American athlete at the University of Colorado and I was the first black athlete to earn a letter at the University of Colorado.
Story_ID: 614838
Speaker 1: Let me go back and get a few background questions.  What's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Truthfully, I don't have a favorite food.  I eat everything and anything.  I have no health problems or digestive problems, so whatever I'm served I can eat and generally enjoy.
Speaker 1: And what is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: I don't have a favorite color.
Speaker 1: How about your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Winter is really my favorite time of the year because I like the cold weather and in my later life, I became a skier, so I look forward to the wintertime and I would take my vacation from the park district [Chicago Park District] and go home, which is Denver, Colorado, and I would spend a month skiing the Rockies [Rocky Mountains].
Speaker 1: So, your favorite vacation destination would be?
Speaker 2: Denver, Colorado, to, to go to the mountains and go to the high country it's known out there and ski.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite saying or something that you've heard from your family or your--one of your parents or that you created?
Speaker 2: Favorite name?
Speaker 1: Saying.
Speaker 2: Saying?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 614839
Speaker 1: Go back into your, your family.  What was your mother's name and her maiden name and sp- --
Speaker 2: My mother was, blank (laughter)--Jennie V. Woolridge [Jennie Woolridge Walton] was her maiden name, W-O-O-L-R-I-D-G-E, Jennie V. Woolridge.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know where she was born?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How far back in your family history can you--can you go?
Speaker 2: I can't go very far back in my family history because we were not a close knit family nor were we a large family.  My father [Claude Walton, Sr.] had three brothers and they had between the three of them two daughters.  There were no Waltons.  There still are no Waltons other than the present.  My--three brothers [sic. uncles] had no male siblings.  My dad was the only member to have a male.  I was that individual.  I had one son [John Walton].  My son has only one son [John Claude Walton] and that's the end of the Walton dynasty at this point.
Speaker 1: Do you recall your mother telling you any stories about your family, her family?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know how she grew up?
Speaker 2: No idea.  My--as I say, I'm told that I was born in Marshall, Texas, and shortly after my birth, my dad moved to Denver, Colorado, where, where my mother's brother [James Woolridge] and her mother [Marie Woolridge] were living.  Why my dad went to Denver, I have no idea, but I would suspect that it had something to do with a job because my earliest--my earliest recollection is that my dad was, was a railroad man and he worked for the Pullman Company [Pullman Palace Car Company], and I strongly suspect that his reason for going to Denver was that he had been offered some sort of a job with the Pullman Company in Denver.
Story_ID: 614840
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your father [Claude Walton, Sr.].  Do you recall--what's the farthest back history you know about your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: No.  I truthfully cannot remember anything at all about my, my dad's brothers.  I am not sure at this point that I--that I was old enough to remember what they looked like even.  So, they never visited us in, in Denver [Colorado] and I never went back to visit them in, in Texas.
Speaker 1: Do you recall your grandparents on your father's or your mother's side?
Speaker 2: I knew none of my grand- none of my grandparents on my father's side.  I knew none of his relatives.  The only grandparent that I knew was on my mother's side [Walton's maternal grandmother, Marie Woolridge] and she lived in Denver with her son [James Woolridge] and, and that's the location where my dad and mother [Jennie Woolridge Walton] went when we left Marshall [Texas].  I know nothing at all about my, my, my maternal grandfather [Jefferson Woolridge].  I never, never knew him, have no idea.
Story_ID: 614841
Speaker 1: Do you recall your mother's mother's name?
Speaker 2: Marie, Marie Woolridge.  She and her son, one son--she had--she had three daughters and one son, my mother [Jennie Woolridge Walton], her sister, Lacy [ph.], and her other sister, Neely [ph.].  Lacy lived in Texas.  Neely lived in, in Kansas City, Missouri.  And that's as much of the--of the Woolridge family as I know.
Speaker 1: And how about the brother?
Speaker 2: The brother, James Woolridge, was in Denver [Colorado] living with my mother [sic. maternal grandmother] at the time that we came from Texas to Denver.  And he remained there and died in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Do you know whether any of them had any children?
Speaker 2: He had one son, but I never met that son.  I think he was--the information that, that I do have about him was that he lived in California, but other than that, I have no knowledge at all of, of him.
Speaker 1: Do you know what his name was?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Now, the two--your mother's two sisters, did they have any children?
Speaker 2: They had--the Lacys had children.  The Neelys--there were no children on the Neelys' side.  The Lacys, I think--I think maybe had maybe four, a couple of boys and a couple of girls, but it seems to me that one summer, one of the--one of the Lacys came to Denver and spent a few weeks.  Other than that, there's just no connection at all that I have with any of my relatives or my grandparents, no recollection or no knowledge of them as I say.  We were not a close knit family and we did not visit, corresponded as much as correspondence was at that time, and we didn't--we didn't remain--we didn't remain connected.  We didn't remain in touch to exchange events, history, things like that just the way our family was.
Speaker 1: Your father, give us his name again.
Speaker 2: Claude Walton [Claude Walton, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Did he have a middle name?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you weren't a junior?
Speaker 2: I was a junior.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, one of the things that I do remember is that growing up, my dad said, "Now when you tell people who you are you're a junior.  If you don't say junior then and somebody calls for you or calls, I'll think it's for me."  So, he reminded me that I should always use the word junior, which I rarely did, but nevertheless, I was--I was aware of the fact that I was a junior.
Speaker 1: Do you know your father's birth date?
Speaker 2: Something I should know, but I don't at this point.  My dad--my dad died in early age.  He was sixty-one when he died and he died in, in 1946.  Yes, he was--he was sixty-one.
Speaker 1: So he was then born in what, 1880s (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Sixty-one, yeah about--somewhere in that time, yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Eighteen seventy-five [1875]?
Speaker 2: Eighteen seventy-five [1875], about?  Sixty-one years.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And did he ever tell you anything about his father [Alex Walton]?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Do you know what his father's name was?
Speaker 1: No idea.
Speaker 2: And you said he had three brothers.
Speaker 1: He had three--and I can't tell you their--Will Walton [ph.], Tom Walton [ph.], and I can't think of the other brother's name.
Speaker 2: And did they all--were they all born in Marshall, Texas?
Speaker 1: I would suspect that they were, yes.
Story_ID: 614842
Speaker 1: What type of personality did your mother [Jennie Woolridge Walton] and father [Claude Walton, Sr.] have?
Speaker 2: (Pause) They were--they were--(laughter) this is a hard thing to--hard thing to describe.
Speaker 1: Let's start with your mother.  What kind of--
Speaker 2: My--
Speaker 1: --personality did she have?
Speaker 2: They were--they were--they were sort of like loners.  They, they--my dad nor my mother had any great amount of contact with their relatives.  My dad and my mother pretty much--we lived alone.  And I hate to say they weren't friendly, they were friendly, but they were just--they were just not--they were not people-people.  That's the best description I can give.  They--we, we did not have a lot of friends.  There weren't people in and out of our house all day long or somebody calling or something like that.  Very sort of--sort of a secluded, as close to being a secluded life without becoming a recluse as you could--as you could find.  And so my, my family life was three people, my mother, my dad, myself.  And most of the time, it was two people because my dad was a railroad man and he was gone off and on.  He came home, then he was back out.  So, most of the time, it was just mother and I, day to day I should say.  We--as I recall, we didn't even have a regular--any regularity in so far as celebrations were concerned because, for example, during the holiday season, we, we couldn't plan a celebration for Christmas because my dad might not be home Christmas or any other day.  His work schedule dictated when he was going to be at home and as a result, that dictated when we might have any sort of a social affair, even such a thing as a Christmas dinner.  If Christmas fell on a--on a--on a work day for him and he wasn't at home, then it was mother and I that had Christmas.  And when my dad came home, we would have Christmas dinner for the family.  So, we were--we were three individuals that were all together related.
Story_ID: 614843
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Jennie Woolridge Walton] work?
Speaker 2: Yes, my, my mother worked part-time.  She worked in a department store in Denver [Colorado] in the China department.  And her job was to--I said China, China and glassware, and that's one of the things that I can remember about my mother's life and our--and our family.  Mother worked in the department where they had glassware and things like that, and when an article would become chipped or damaged and would go on sale, my mother would buy it and bring it home.  And as a result, we had a lot of fine silver--or a lot of fine cut glasswork that was slightly damaged and I remember that this--that this was something that was some conversation about when we started talking and she'd say, "Well, this was--this is a famous make but it has a little chip here and they couldn't sell it as new," so this was the sort of thing, which I think ultimately lead to mother's becoming interested in collections, and in her later life, she became a coin collector.  And at this point, I have a bag full of silver coins that--some of which are valuable, but they are all, in most cases just what they call the street coins.  They were coins that had been used and, and she would--she would read them or check them when she received them to see the dates and the mint mark and that sort of thing.  And if it were an unusual date or an unusual mint mark, why that coin went into, into her collection box.  And the later part of her life she spent collecting coins and I have the results of her collection here now that I guess I'm going to pass on to my son [John Walton] who seems to be interested in it.  And one of these days, why he's going to sit down and go through and see gems my--the family has acquired over years, and he himself has become somewhat of a coin collector.  So, that's one of the--one of the areas one of the activities that I remember as being pretty frequently conducted in the house, was a discussion of--over the coins and how many there were and how much they were at that time.  All this is the old--back in the days when all the money was silver and gold, and that, that I think, as I said, was stemmed from the fact that--stems from the fact that mother collected glassware when she worked at the department store.
Story_ID: 614844
Speaker 1: Mr. Walton [HistoryMaker Claude Walton], we were talking about your mother's [Jennie Woolridge Walton] coin collection.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you help her put those coins together or--?
Speaker 2: Not really.  She--this was--I didn't know anything about coins.  I wasn't really interested.  What really happened was that my uncle [James Woolridge] was a doorman at the Brown Palace Hotel [Brown Palace Hotel and Spa], which is quite a famous hotel in Denver [Colorado].  I mean, when you stayed at the Brown Palace, it was like staying maybe at the--what, the Ritz Carlton in New York [Ritz Carlton Hotel, New York, New York] or someplace like that.  That was the hotel and he was the doorman there.  And all the famous people coming and going always stayed and he got tips.  So, when my uncle would come home in the evening, he would put his tips out on the table and before anything else happened, my mother would go through them, sort of hurriedly to see if there were any dates on there that were outstanding.  And so that was her beginning.  And as I say, I got a whole bag of what they call street coins primarily because they were--represent the tips that my--that my uncle received that over the years, I've got a substantial collection of coins in there.  But, I had never been interested to the extent that I would take them into a, a collector and see what they were worth.  I have books that I look over every now and then to see what the value of them would be, but I have--I have never--I have never really gone in and cataloged them, so to speak.  I have some books that are in--the coins are in order, a collection of coins for say over a period of years in the order that they were minted that my mother had, but I have this bag of coins that I shift around from one corner to the other every now and then and my son [John Walton] is interested.  My wife [HistoryMaker Darwin McBeth Walton] has become interested in collecting and she now buys special issues and commemorative coins and that sort of thing, all stemming from my mother's interest in--back when she was alive, my, my wife went back and, and got quite an enjoyment out of going over these coins and talking about them with my mother.
Speaker 1: Did your mother have any books on coins--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --that she used to--as a reference?
Speaker 2: No.  Oh, I think back then, after she got started she bought some books.  There are coin books that list all of them and the value of the mints.  The minting and the number that was--that were minted and any defects or anything.  If a coin is--has a defect, why that becomes worth its weight in gold.  But she did not go in elaborate--to any elaborate system, although as I say, she did get--you can buy coin books in which you can list each year and collection, maybe ten or twenty years of coins or whatever.  She had that.
Story_ID: 614845
Speaker 1: You said that your father [Claude Walton, Sr.] was--because he was a Pullman porter, he spent a lot of time away from home and you spent a lot of time with your mother [Jennie Woolridge Walton].  What types of things did you and your mother do?
Speaker 2: We didn't do very much back then.  There was nothing to do.  You must remember, we're talking about the days before radio and television.  As a matter of fact, I remember making my first little radio with a spool of wire and a crystal (laughter) and an earphone, and the first radio set that we bought, a tube set incidentally, I made a cabinet for it.  It was an Atwater Kent radio, which was the famous product at that time, and it was about, about two feet long and maybe four, five, six inches high.  And I was in the woodwork shop at school and I made a cabinet for my--for the--for the radio at home, and when I finished it, I took it home and my family was quite proud of the fact that I had made this piece of furniture.  And for years, we kept the radio in that cabinet, and even after it sort of became rickety and unstable, why it still sat in the corner as a--as a reminder of my carpentry days in school.
Speaker 1: Do you--during the times when your father was home, do you recall any kind of activities that you and him participated in?
Speaker 2: No, my dad wasn't a very active person.  We lived--we really lived a very simple, non-spectacular life.  It was--it was--it was sort of cut and dried to the extent that because things could not be planned in advance, why it was--it was whatever happened.  And we didn't have--I had a great family.  I mean, my, my dad, my mother, and myself, we just got along great.  But, I characterize our relationship as one of three individuals--three independent individuals.  It was the sort of thing where my dad didn't depend on my mother, my mother didn't depend upon my dad, I didn't depend upon either one of them (laughter).  So, it was under these conditions because generally, it, it was--it was a makeshift for mother and I except when dad was there.  And there weren't many--too, too many distractions back in those days that took me away, took our attention away.  I mean, if you didn't play table games, why there were no games.  So, we had--I--it has affected my life, my later life in that I hate to say this, but I don't have the same need for people (laughter).  I can do without you (laughter).  It isn't a good thing to say, but I mean, if you're around, fine.  If you're not around, I'm not--I'm not worried because as I say, this is the kind of background that, that we had at the house.
Story_ID: 614846
Speaker 1: Do you know how your mother [Jennie Woolridge Walton] and father [Claude Walton, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: No idea.
Speaker 1: Between the two of them, who do you think you, you have the personality of?
Speaker 2: Well, I probably have--I probably have a mixture of the two.  Their--neither my mother or dad had any extremes.  And I say this truthfully, I can't recall ever having heard a disagreeable word in my family.  There was just that sort of relationship.  We--no fights, no arguments, no nothing.  And we all sort of agreed that look, we'll each live our lives independently and yet we will live together.  So, I grew up in a--in a very calm sort of an atmosphere.  And even--all of my life, I've been that way.  I really never had any fights in my life.  I'm not a short tempered person.  I can--I can make an adjustment very easily.  I have no difficulty in saying, "No I'm not gonna do this" or "No I'm not gonna get involved in that" and, and sticking to it.  I have--I have never cultivated any seriously bad habits because of that fact.  We just--it wasn't something that existed in our house.  We had a very--a very peaceful household.  No loud words.  No swearing of any kind.  I never, never heard a swear word in my house, never between my mother and my dad.
Story_ID: 614847
Speaker 1: Did your family have a church relationship?
Speaker 2: Yes, but there, once again, it was--it was an individual sort of thing.  It's--now that I stop and think it--it's really funny how I grew up.  We were like three individuals.  In my youth, I went to the Central Baptist Church [Denver, Colorado] which was where my mother [Jennie Woolridge Walton] went (laughter).  My father [Claude Walton, Sr.] went to New Hope Baptist Church [Denver, Colorado], which was another church.  And, you know, that--you wonder, well, why weren't they going to the same church?  I have no idea, but that's just the way we were.  We were never together.  And, of course, it's one of the things that certainly affected my life since then because, because of that background and that approach, why I--my family has suffered somewhat in that I have--I have never been extremely what you call close with them.  We're a good family, but that is not that kind of family, well I got to have you by my side or something.  Dependable, yes.  There never was any question about dependability, but the social mixing--and that's probably the reason that I'm not a great social person in that we--that, that just wasn't part of my life.
Story_ID: 614848
Speaker 1: Could you describe your neighborhood?  And who were your friends and--
Speaker 2: Well, I--in Denver [Colorado], that was the one thing about Denver, while it wasn't segregated in--to the extent that, segregation where you live here, you can't live there, you lived any place in Denver.  The only segregation was whether you could afford it.  If you moved into the neighborhood that you--that you could afford, why your neighbors were probably--my neighbors were more of the--of the white race than they were of the what we called colored race then.  Well, we all lived next door to each other and I grew up in a mixed community and mixed neighborhood.  My friends, my playmates were kids that lived a few doors away.  And so, I grew up being accustomed to mixing even in social life with my neighbors, what social life we had.  But, that was it, which certainly stood me in good stead because I developed no prejudices.  I realized the difference, I realized the situation, but I also realized that we had to live together.  We got along together because we all lived together, so that has always stood me in good stead.  I--one of the reasons that I have been--was successful in the--in my--in my work was that I have always been able to mix, to fit in with the crowd, to be--I mean, with the--meet the requirements of whatever was necessary to function.  I've always been able to--I never had any difficulty adjusting to this person because they were a different race or that person because--
Speaker 1: What was--what was the name--was there a particular name for your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: No name.  It didn't have--we lived in east Denver and that was the whole of--whole east Denver.  That was the section predominantly of various minorities.  Denver, Denver was not a--was not a large city.  I think back in my day, we had--I think I heard a figure thrown around once that we had five thousand blacks in Denver--Afro Americans I'd say in Denver.  Denver has always been sort of a mixture because it's--we've always had a lot of Mexican immigrants come in and work the sugar fields around.  It was one of the big industries around Denver.  And so we--we've all had--always had a substantial Hispanic neighborhood, so between the Hispanics, the African Americans, and that was about it.  We didn't have many foreigners come in primarily because we didn't have an industry that attracted them.  We had a lot of mining, so we had individuals.  Most of the foreigners that were in were into the mining business, silver and gold.
Speaker 1: Were there--was there a Native American population in Denver at that time?
Speaker 2: Not a large Native American population, not in Denver itself, more so in Wyoming and Montana than in, than in Denver.  I can't recall any, any substantial number of Native Americans being in Denver.
Story_ID: 614849
Speaker 1: What was the, the kind of the social atmosphere?  What kind of music was popular during those days?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Charleston (laughter), Charleston and, of course, you danced music to--what do I want to say?  You didn't freelance your dancing.  You danced the two step, you danced the foxtrot, you danced the waltz.  You don't know anything about that (laughter).  Today, you get out and you do whatever you feel like doing.  But, back then, literally--and the music was played.  They played waltzes and they played foxtrots and they played two steps.  And the two step music was two steps, and that was one of my--one of my fields.  I played music back then, too.
Speaker 1: What music did you play?  What instrument?
Speaker 2: Piano.
Speaker 1: And how'd you learn to play the piano?
Speaker 2: One of the things that my family did when I was growing up was give me music.  Every week, I took a music lesson.  And by the time I was in high school [West High School, Denver, Colorado], I was proficient, good enough to be able to play in a band.  And when I went to high school, I was working at night in a dance band.  And the reason I'm saying what I did about the music was that we played in the taxi dance--what was called the taxi dance hall.  You know what taxi dance is?
Speaker 1: No, sir.
Speaker 2: It's a dance hall where they hired women as dancers and the men came in and bought tickets.  You heard the song 'Ten Cents a Dance'?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: That's where it originated.  You'd buy a ticket for a dance, you'd go out and give that ticket to one of the hostesses, the band played for about three minutes, a foxtrot or a waltz, and that's what you paid for, and that was a taxi dance.  I worked in one of those dance halls and that's why I am saying what I did about the music.  I wasn't just making it up.  We literally played a foxtrot and a waltz.  Waltzing was popular then.  I mean, if you didn't know how to waltz, why you couldn't dance.  But that was--that was--so, that was our music and that's one of the things in my life that I did early on that I really remember.
Speaker 1: And how old were you during this period?
Speaker 2: I was in high school, so I was probably fifteen or sixteen.
Speaker 1: Now, were these dance halls, were they predominantly white or were they--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.  I played in a dance hall down--in downtown Denver [Colorado] and I would finish playing at night and go home and get up the next day.  I was in junior high.  And I would--when I went to high school, one of the reasons I didn't play football was I went out for football and the first or second day, somebody stepped on my hand and hurt my fingers, injured my finger and I couldn't work, couldn't play, so I gave up football.  But, I was--I was playing in the band in high school.  I played all through high school and played in the--and part of the time while I was at the University of Colorado [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado].  As a matter of fact, it was my ability to play music that helped to supply me with the necessary financial funds I needed to stay in school.
Speaker 1: When you were playing in high school, do you remember how much you were getting paid?
Speaker 2: I was a high price musician on the campus.  I played for tea dances and I got three dollars an hour, which was a lot of money back then.  When I played in the band, I don't remember the exact amount that I received, but I remember in my high school days, I used to walk around with seventy-five dollars in gold in my pocket.  I had a twenty-five dollar gold piece and a fifty dollar gold piece that I had in my pocket at all times.  So, that--as I say, I don't remember the exact amount.  As I say, the reason I remember the three dollars is because it was only an hour.  I played the tea--what they called a tea dance, and this was while I was in school at the university.  They had the fraternities or the sororities were allowed to have a tea dance between the dinner hour and the study hour.  Dinner was at six.  At seven o'clock, you could have a tea dance, and for that tea dance, I was hired to provide the music.  Once again, telling you about the times, this is before the times of your automatic radio, phonographs and things like that and no radio music.  You had a musician come in and play, and I got three dollars for an hour's playing.

Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your experience in high school.
Speaker 2: I never was a--I never was an athlete, really.  I'm successful purely by, by luck.  But, this really gets involved.  You mean, you really want me to tell you about this?
Speaker 1: Well, in terms of--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --you know, what--
Speaker 2: What--
Speaker 1: --what your memories--
Speaker 2: --what brought it on?
Speaker 1: --what memories did you have about high school?
Speaker 2: Well, you see, I was a normal teenager.  Don't get the idea that I was a stick in the mud.  I was a normal teenager and I did everything that any--that any other teenager did, and to the same degree that other teenagers did.  As a result, the--first of all because I was a musician, I was invited to all of the parties that my group--that the teenagers would have because by inviting me, they had music.  So, I always was invited to the parties and I alternated with some other pianist that might be there, and played music.  And as a result, I generally had a nice looking girl sitting at my side to keep me company.  And I partied and partied and partied, and forgot all about the school, and looked up one day and found out that I wasn't making it in school because of all my partying, you know, I'm gonna party.  As a matter of fact, I said to my dad [Claude Walton, Sr.] one day, I came home and I said, "Dad, I'm gonna quit work.  I'm making money," had a pocket full of money, and "I'm gonna--I'm gonna quit school and work."  And he looked at me and he said, "No, you're not gonna quit school and stay here."  He said, "Now, I'm trying to provide you with the opportunity to live a better life than I am living," and he said, "As long as I am willing to do that, you are going to accept it, that is, if you live here.  Now, if you say to me that you are making enough money and that you're prepared to live on your own, then you go upstairs and pack your bag and go, but it's a one way door.  Once you go out, you don't come back."  And my dad wasn't joking about that.  The one thing about him, a very strict person but a very considerate person, and no fooling around.  I got--I can count the whippings that I got in my lifetime because dad said after the hurt's gone, why I'd turn around and do the same thing, so he didn't believe in whipping me.  But, what he said, he meant.  So, that eliminated my leaving home and going on my own.  So, I continued playing, but I cut out some of my partying.  And the reason I went to the school, you heard me talk about the four high school, five high schools, the reason that I didn't go to Manual [Manual High School, Denver, Colorado] because, because that's all where all my cronies went and the same sort of life went along.  I went to junior high and then to the high school, so rather than be influenced by that along with the fact that I also had a little part-time job, I went to West [West High School, Denver, Colorado].  And over at West, there were only fourteen of us in the school of fifteen hundred.
Story_ID: 614851
Speaker 1: Fourteen black students?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Fourteen black students?
Speaker 2: Fourteen black students.  So, the first thing is that, that I didn't have all the social life to contact.  I didn't have that.  That just didn't exist.  That went out the window.  And I didn't have the environment.  I didn't have the encouragement.  So then, I decided to go out for athletics.  I had not been an athlete and I went out for basketball.  And because I was tall, six feet, I made the team.  I was the only one on the team.  And I won't burden you down with more pictures and whatnot, but I do have pictures of me as a high school basketball player.
Speaker 1: We would like to see those if you do have them.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You'll be all night going through my stuff.  Anyway, that was the beginning of my athletics actually in high school [West High School, Denver, Colorado].  I played basketball for the first time, I went out for track for the first time.  And the only reason that I did that was that I got away from that social environment of partying to something more concrete and more acceptable in so far as everyday life was concerned in the form of athletics.  So, instead of doing all the things that I did prior to, I spent my time practicing after school and that sort of thing.  And, so, I was able to develop enough skills in high school without a coach, really a coach because the high school coaches didn't--weren't as specialized as they are today.  They had one coach that maybe did three or four sports.  I mean, you were--he handed me a discus and he said, "Go out and you throw this.  This is the way you do it and here's a shot.  You do that."  And that was about it.  So, my entire life changed at the time I left junior high and went to high school.  I dropped my social life, so to speak, and I--that's when I picked up my athletic life.  And from that point on, that sort of--that sort of carried me over.  Because in order to do athletics, I had to keep the grades.  If I didn't pass my grades, I couldn't be on the team.  So, that was the motivation for doing it.  And, really, that was the turning point because otherwise, I probably would've wound up like too many of my other friends at that time, partying away and getting involved in anything and everything, and probably having my dad [Claude Walton, Sr.] tell me to pack my bags and leave (laughter).
Story_ID: 614852
Speaker 1: Mr. Walton [HistoryMaker Claude Walton], we were talking about some of your high school activities and when you were in high school [West High School, Denver, Colorado], you were, what seventeen, eighteen when you were--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you were in high school just about the time that the Great Depression--you were born in 1913.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no I was--I was in high school in 1929 for the Great Depression where one day everybody in the world was a millionaire and the market crashed and the next day everybody was a pauper, broke, dead broke, no money of any kind because of the--of the conditions in and it's funny, this same sort of--the same sort of buildup that brought on the '29 [1929] depression is the sort of buildup that brought on the '08 [2008] depression in that the requirements and the controls were let down to meet the demand and the greater demand, the less control was required.  So, back in '29 [1929] in those days, you could go out and buy stock on margin with nothing down or with a small amount down and you could hold this stock, and when it went up, you sold it and you made money and it continued to go up.  So, people went into the market and had hundreds and hundreds of blocks of stock that made them millionaires on paper, and then one day they woke up and the market crashed, and all that paper that they had, paper money they had or paper stock they had, was of no value and you literally didn't have a dime in your pocket.  And this was about the situation that we had in '08 [2008].  We let all this.  We incurred all this debt, credit, let people buy whatever they wanted with no money down.  If you had bad credit, you could get it.  If you had no credit at all, you could get it.  And then you looked up one day and there was no real money.  It was all paper money.  So, it was a tragic situation in that there were very few restrictions in the market just as has been the case in '08 [2008], restrictions in certain areas.  I mean, that's the broad term of it.  But, yes, I can remember the times.  I can remember people were just--I mean, they weren't--this was the first time anything had happened and everybody was frantic.  I mean, people were literally committing suicide and doing all sorts of things.  We were fortunate in that dad [Claude Walton, Sr.] had a regular job and while the conditions changed, he still had--he never was without a job.  He didn't lose his job with the Pullman Company [Pullman Palace Car Company].  And so, we were not subject to any great amount of discomfort because we didn't have necessary means to live.
Story_ID: 614853
Speaker 1: It greatly affected my schooling because there were just no ways and means of making any money back then, so my going to school depended totally upon my ability to generate some funds, to make money.  I remember I had to convince a store owner that I really was an honest guy.  I needed an overcoat and I said, "If you'll let me have the coat, I will pay you so much money every week or every month."  And--because there wasn't a--there wasn't that kind of credit available back then.  There were no credit cards, you must remember, so either you had the money in your pocket to pay for it or you--or you didn't have or you had a weekly payment.  So, I remember saying, "I will--I will give you two dollars or three dollars a week on this--on this item that I--that I need," and in that way, I was able to keep going.  I guess I was--once again, our independence that I spoke of with our family, I felt that my family had, had done very well by me in providing me with an education through high school [West High School, Denver, Colorado].  They had done very well with--in giving me music that I had been able to earn some money, and as a result, I felt that from that point on, I should make it on my own.  So, I did not ask my family for any money to send me.  Although, I'm the only child and they would've done so, I did not take any money from my family to go to school.  That's why I said I was a hasher for my room and board and I played music to get--to get the money.  And this condition I think made me a much better independent--much better individual because it taught me the fundamentals of life and I think that while my relationship with my--with my family has not been perfect because I am not a dependent person and I don't ask people to do much for me or anything (laughter), you might notice, and what happened to me then, what made such an impression that that has--that has been my life.  I have never been a seeker of help.  As a matter of fact, I sort of resent thinking of myself as having to go seek help, which is not good and I realize in that respect.  My wife [HistoryMaker Darwin McBeth Walton] hates me because of it.  But, you see, all of these things that I did as a youth played an important part on molding my life.  And because we were the sort of family we were, I didn't go in and sit down and talk to mother [Jennie Woolridge Walton] and dad [Claude Walton, Sr.] about, well, I, I need--I need a new pair of shoes or I need a coat.  Beyond a certain point, I never asked my parents for anything, although they gave me everything I needed when I needed it, but I never asked them to give me anything.  And this made me a--probably a very difficult person to live with in later life because even now, I don't ask my family to help me or anything.  I get up and help myself.  And I'm not saying it's the best thing in the world, but at least it hasn't been the worst thing.  It has kept me out of the straight--kept me on the straight and narrow, and has made me sort of think things through or at least think of the possible end before I got involved at the beginning.  I thought, well, what's this--what's the final?  What's the bottom line on this?  Perhaps, one of the greatest things that happened in my life was the Depression of '29 [Great Depression], which, which made me the man that I needed to be to get by in the world.
Story_ID: 614854
Speaker 1: In high school [West High School, Denver, Colorado] or even before high school, what did you want to be?
Speaker 2: Nothing.  No idea.  You see, (laughter) it's difficult for you, individual of today, to maybe to understand or appreciate the conditions.  And there was no real incentive for me to be anything other than a good human being and do whatever I could do to get along.  It was only because of the fact that I guess I came in contact with what a better life is, plus the fact that I never will forget my dad [Claude Walton, Sr.] saying to me, "Now, I'm working, trying to provide you with the opportunity to live a better life than I am," not that there was anything wrong with his life, but dad was just a Pullman porter, never anything other than that.  And it was not his intention that his son should grow up to be a Pullman porter.  Same thing was true with my mother [Jennie Woolridge Walton] and giving me music.  So as a result, this was the sort of attitude that was instilled upon--in, in me at that time, and it stood me in good stead.
Story_ID: 614855
Speaker 1: Did you have any particular people you felt were like a mentor or a role model for you?
Speaker 2: No.  There were no mentors back then.  As I said, I think we had two policemen in Denver [Colorado], a half a dozen postmen or people at the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service], one man working at the state capitol [Colorado State Capitol, Denver, Colorado].
Speaker 1: These were people of color, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, people of color.  The big jobs were elevator pilot in the--in the stores, soda dispensers at the drug--at the drugstores, waiters.  Everybody was a waiter and service, service area.  Everything was a service area.  As I say, I think--I think actually there were two lawyers and one got disbarred, and I'm thinking of three dentists and I'm thinking of a couple of doctors, so what kind of mentor was there for me to be?  I mean, all of my--all of my friends were doing the things that all of my friends did.  When they got out of school, they worked on the soda fountain, they worked at the department store or they--most of the people in Denver that were in school that didn't stay in Denver went away to school.  But, it was a long time before Denver became friendly to--towards minorities and so far as jobs were concerned, I mean, years later.  So, you see, the--and, and don't talk about business or anything like that.  Yes, we had some individuals that were in real estate because you could buy up real estate.  We had individuals who had stores and what not, little family stores where we all went in and had little charge accounts.  You kept a book and we paid her on--paid her on pay day or something like that, local family owned businesses.  But, no big people that you could point to and say, "Well, gee, I want to be--I want to be like this person."  Even politically, we weren't into any, any politics.  A few people that were in had little minor jobs and whatnot, but we were not really into politics, so that was not an influence.  So, there were no real influencing factors other than yourself that made you--or I shouldn't say, made me want to go to school.  I couldn't look back and say, "Gee, I want to be like so and so."  There were no predecessors to me at the University of Colorado [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado].  That sums it up in a nutshell.  So, if it had not--if I had not been determined to go, why there was nobody up there that was ahead of me that I said, "I want to be like him."
Story_ID: 614856
Speaker 1: Take us back to how you got involved in sports, particularly in high school.  You told me a little story about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well as I say--as I said, I got away from the social life of my life and went into something that had a little more substance and a little more meaning or that had a greater demand.  I went into--I went into sports.  And as I say, as a result of doing that, I had to do my studying because if I didn't pass my hours, why I couldn't participate in the sports.  So really, that's where the change took place and that happened in high school.  I was--I was on the verge of being a failure in junior high because I didn't study, you know.  I mean, I did enough to get by.  But, I feel certain that if I had not switched schools and my--that happened not because of my athletics, it happened only because I had a little job.  The thing that took me out to West High [West High School, Denver, Colorado] was the fact that I had this little job over near West High and I needed to be that close to my job, and so that was the first thing.  Then after I went to West, I thought well, I'll go out for sports.  I had--I'd--I never was anything.  I'm not a good swimmer because I almost drown in the Y pool.  I'm not--I'm not afraid of water but I'm not comfortable with water only because I jumped in the pool and just didn't make it and they had to pull me out.  So, I never--I didn't play any basketball.  I didn't do anything.  So, all of my athletic accomplishment occurred from high school on.
Speaker 1: How old were you when you jumped in the pool at the Y?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know, I must've been ten or twelve or something like that.  I was just a kid and, you know, the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] was the place that we went for our recreational activities.  We didn't have organized activities like we do today.  I went to the Y and played in the gym and swam in the pool, played volleyball and that sort of thing.  But--and in the--there was nothing outdoors in the--in the--in the--other than the summer.  The playgrounds closed up because they didn't have any indoor facilities.  All of the playgrounds just had outdoor facilities and that's how the--really the boys clubs and the girl clubs and all those clubs came into being because they had to provide someplace indoor for the youth, and that's how those things came into being.  They moved them indoors and had--built gyms and had indoor games.
Story_ID: 614857
Speaker 1: When you started getting into sports, did you have any particular sports heroes?
Speaker 2: There were no sports heroes, really.  I told you I was a basketball--or baseball player.  The only thing I knew was baseball and that was because my [maternal] uncle [James Woolridge] had the baseball team [White Elephants].  And on Sunday, all of the players would meet at my--at my uncle's house, my grandmother [Marie Woolridge] and, of course, where my--that's where we lived, they would meet there on Sunday early in the day to form the team, all the players.  There were no really organized teams, highly organized.  A group of men got together every week and played.  And they went down to the lot and played basketball and before the game was over, they passed a hat around and people dropped in coins and--to buy balls and bats.  That's how they supplied the (laughter)--everything was volunteer.  There was--there was--there was no support, so there was nothing--there was nothing unusual or unusually attractive about that.  You know, it wasn't a--it wasn't as today highly organized uniforms and balls and bats and all the hoopla.  The ball, you played with until it wore out, I mean.  And if you had two bats or three bats, why that was it.  So, what I'm saying is that there wasn't--there wasn't a lot of incentive other than what you could generate to do any other than be a good human being.
Speaker 1: How about Joe Louis?  Were you (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes, Joe Louis was (laughter)--Joe Louis was just coming into his prime.  As a matter of fact, I go back to the--to the void that was created before Joe Louis in my time, was Jack Johnson.  And it was because of Jack Johnson's escapades that that period of time came into being when they swore there would never be another colored champion.
Speaker 1: Tell us what you remember about the Jack Johnson era.
Speaker 2: Well, it--just what I heard, that he was a great boxer, greatest boxer, just powerful and knocked everybody out and made a lot of money.  And--but that he married a white woman, and that was totally unacceptable, totally unacceptable, and as a result, prior to Joe Louis, there were no heavyweight champions.  Joe Louis was--and you know what they did with Joe Louis?  They made sure that Joe Louis didn't follow in the footsteps of Jack Johnson.  They made sure that Joe Louis married--that's when he married Trotter from Chicago [Illinois] here, Marva Trotter [Marva Trotter Louis], and that was--that's the background on that.  But, the only really boxing draw was heavyweight.  You know, the--everything else was nickel and dime stuff.  The big thing in boxing was the heavyweight.
Speaker 1: Did you ever have an opportunity to see Joe Louis?
Speaker 2: No.  Oh, yeah, I saw him here, yeah.  Sure, I saw him when I came back to Chicago.  I met Joe Louis someplace or other, but it was no big deal back then, nice individual.
Speaker 1: But you never saw him box during--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --that period?
Speaker 2: I've never been a boxing fan.  I've never been--I've never been--I've never been that kind of person.  I'm not--I'm not into punishing sort of sports, boxing, wrestling, things like that.  Of course, now every--all of it is (laughter) is rough and tumble and everything goes.  You see, back in my day, if you looked hard at an individual in the basketball court, that was a foul.  Today, you climb all over the individual and knock them halfway across the court and, you know, it's acceptable.  I never will forget how we used to talk about basketball was a non-contact sport.  You look at basketball today and you wouldn't think it was a non-contact sport.  And I look at football, man, I look at the way these guys are--and I feel sorry for them because when they get to be my age, they're really not gonna be able to walk.  The body just wasn't designed to take that kind of punishment.  But, as I say, the things back then, there were--there were no really visible glaring incidents or situations or events that said--made you feel like, gee, I want to do that.
Story_ID: 614858
Speaker 1: You played high school basketball [for West High School, Denver, Colorado].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Which--did you just play the schools in the Denver [Colorado] area?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you--
Speaker 2: Except, except when you got to the state tournament.  And there were no traveling teams.  You didn't do any traveling.  I mean, it--played all local teams.  It wasn't that highly organized.  Your schedule included all the teams in Denver and the only time you played another team was if you got to the state finals in which the champions from all around the state came together and played in the Denver auditorium [Denver Municipal Auditorium, Denver, Colorado].
Speaker 1: Did your school ever get to the state championship when you were--
Speaker 2: We got to the state--we got to the state--we got to the state championship--(background noise).  Oh, boy.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: We were talking about high school basketball.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You said your team--
Speaker 1: And incidentally, I think probably I might have been the only one--there might've been one or two more playing in that tournament.  Because, see, around, around Colorado at that time, why there weren't--we--there were none of us in, in activities.  Denver was--maybe Colorado Springs [Colorado] and Pueblo [Colorado], but there would've been no other participation by any--in the small towns, why they wouldn't have had any schools.  That's why somebody said I should be all state probably because I probably was the only one in there of color.
Speaker 2: You were--so, you were the only black basketball player on your high school team?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah, on, on, on my team.  Now, there was Manual [Manual High School, Denver, Colorado].  Manual, Manual had a team.  But then, you see, we beat Manual and that's what made us eligible.  We won--pardon me.  We won the championship that--the city championship, and that made us eligible for the state tournament.
Speaker 2: What year was this?
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Thirty-one [1931] or '32 [1932].  It's--I--'31 [1931]?  It might've been '31 [1931].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: And Manual was a predominantly black school--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in the area?
Speaker 1: Manual, Manual training school, it was called.  And that--they literally specialized in manual training, learning how to build and that sort of thing, the trades and that.  That's what they primarily specialized in.  And that's incidentally what the outlook was for us, maybe to become tradespeople, service.
Speaker 2: What position did you play?
Speaker 1: Center.
Speaker 2: And were you the highest scorer on your team?
Speaker 1: No.  You didn't--I remember we played a game, the score was a single digit.  You didn't--you didn't fire the ball away at the basket.  That just--I mean, it was a restricted--it was really a restricted game.  There were so many things you couldn't do that--what you see now is not what basketball originally was back in those days.  It was literally a non-contact sport and I'm not kidding.  If you looked too hard at the guy, why (laughter), the referee would call you for it.  So, there we are.
Story_ID: 614859
Speaker 1: When you were playing high school basketball [for West High School, Denver, Colorado], did you experience any situations where you went to play a school and because you were the only black player on the team that you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  As a matter of fact, and the one incident that I remember was in the state tournament.  I played against a team and the team I was playing against, this guy, he did everything in the world.  He called me everything that you could think of.  And after the game, why, he came over to our locker, our locker area and apologized.  He said that's what the coach told him to do, go in there and work on me and try and get me to foul out because they felt that if he could psychologically influence me into acting by calling me the worst name in the world or doing things, that the public would see that I had reacted and would--they'd put me out.  And so the coach told him to work on me and, and it didn't work.  And he came over after the game, I never will forget that, and he said, "I want you to know that that isn't me, but that's what the coach told me to do and that's what I did."  The same thing, carrying it on, the same thing happened to me at the university.  Now, I was on the basketball team at, at Colorado [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado] with one of the most famous coaches in the--in the country at that time, Hank Iba [Henry Iba], who was a--who was a master at basketball.  I mean, it--what Hank Iba didn't say about basketball other than Adolph Rope- Rupp [Adolph Rupp], but Hank Iba was a master at coaching outstanding team players.  And I was on his--he was the coach for a few years at the university, and I was there, and I was on his team.  And he said to me at Christmastime, we normally tour sections or schools during the holiday season and play practice games.  You know, they do that before the season opens.  And most of the teams that they had scheduled for Colorado were southern teams because all of the coaches that we had at Colorado at that time were southerners, and so they naturally scheduled teams in the areas where they knew.  So, when they got ready to go on the tour, he called me into his office and he said, "Now, I'm not gonna take you on the tour because if you're any kind of a human being at all, you're not gonna put up with what you're gonna have to go through if I take you."  He said, "I know what's gonna happen to you."  And so, as a result, I did not go on the tour with the Colorado team that year for the--for the--for the basketball season.  And, so I say that only to say that that was--that was the thing then because they knew--first of all, they knew that if one of us were on the team, we were the best player out there.  And I said this to my coach one day when he--we were talking and I--he had not selected me to go to a meet and I said to him, "Coach, you know, I realize that if I were not the best discus thrower in school or one of the best discus throwers in the conference, I wouldn't be on your team."  And I said, "Any time I come down to the locker and my uniform isn't there, I don't need any explanation.  I'll know what happened.  You decided to kick me off."  I said, "But I realize that, that there's nobody to compete me."  And that was--that was true.  And the coach, that made a great impact upon him.  Three years later when my buddy [Gil Cruter] came along and he was the coach, when he graduated, this same coach gave him a gold watch.  He was a high jumper.

Speaker 1: We were talking about you're graduating from high school now and you're getting ready to go to college.  How did you go from high school [West High School, Denver, Colorado] to University of Colorado [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado]?  What--how did you get there?
Speaker 2: I--the summer of '32 [1932], '33 [1933], an individual came down from Casper, Wyoming, to Denver [Colorado] and he was looking for a piano player to go back to Casper and, and work, and somebody told him about me, and he came to my house and talked to my mother [Jennie Woolridge Walton], talked to me and said that he had this little band in Casper and he had a job, he needed a piano player, that I could come up--that if I would come up there, I could stay with his father and they would--they would look out after me and take care of me, convincingly enough to the extent that my mother said, "Yes."  Unconvincingly as she was to my--to my father [Claude Walton, Sr.], he said it was the worst thing in the world that she could've done, and that as a result, they had just lost a son, that I'd never be worth a dime.  She never should've allowed me to go.  Anyway, she did.  And I went up to Wyoming and joined this band and the individual that came down to Denver to--and talked me into it, worked as--he and his wife worked as the housekeepers for the governor of Wyoming.
Speaker 1: Now, were these--was he black or was he--
Speaker 2: No, he was white.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And was the band white?
Speaker 2: The band was black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But what I--the--I'm tying this in because the band--the leader of the band was black and this was his side job, but his regular job was--he and his wife were the housekeeper for the governor.  I got up there and played with the band and I was up to--he took me up to the house one day where the governor lived and they introduced me to the governor.  And his wife was on the board of regents at the University of Wyoming [Laramie, Wyoming], and this individual that had brought me up there, the band leader, said to them, "Walton [HistoryMaker Claude Walton] here is--wants to go to college and he's looking for an opportunity."  And the governor's wife said, "Well, if he wants to go to school, I will arrange that he can come to the University of Wyoming."  I thought, boy, what did he--I said, "Fine," and then I said, "Well, fine, I can come to the University of Wyoming and then I can drive back to Casper and work and play jobs," and they said, "No, you can't do that.  Because in the wintertime, wherever you are, you're there.  Once the snow comes, you don't go anyplace."  So, that's why I did not get to Wyoming.  But, in the meantime, one of my buddies in Denver, one of my friends, called my mother and said that if I--if I wanted to go to school, that there was an opening at the Chi Psi house for a hasher, and that if I wanted to go to Colorado, I could get a job as a hasher, and my mother told me.
Story_ID: 614861
Speaker 1: --What a hash- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, now you know why I'm at Colorado [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado].  My--
Speaker 1: Explain what a hasher is.
Speaker 2: Oh, a hasher is the individual that serves the food to the--to the frat brothers, three meals a day, breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and for that service, they were give--I was given a- accommodations, an apartment in the basement, and my food, which was the big item for going to school, room and board.  So, that's how I happened to go to Colorado.  Otherwise, I would've gone to Wyoming [University of Wyoming, Laramie, Wyoming].
Speaker 1: What was the individual's name that came down to Denver [Colorado], do you remember?
Speaker 2: You know, I'm sitting here and it keeps coming and going and coming, Mr. Pierce [ph.].  By George, just like that it comes.  Pierce was his name.  He and his wife, as I say, were the housekeepers for the governor of Wyoming.  His name was Pierce.  And, anyway, I told my mother [Jennie Woolridge Walton] yes and she told my friend in Denver that, yes, I'd like to do that.  So, instead of going to Wyoming, I worked the summer up there.  As a matter of fact, I worked two summers up there.  The year later, I went back to Wyoming and (laughter), and worked up there.  There comes another story of--(laughter) that I won't tell you about, my experience up there in Wyoming.  But, I came back to Denver at the end of the summer much to the surprise of my dad [Claude Walton, Sr.] and the--and the--and the--and the happiness of my mother that they hadn't lost me.  And I went to--went to Boulder [Colorado] and got my job as a hasher, and that was my beginning.  That was in 1933.
Story_ID: 614862
Speaker 1: Just to back up, tell us a little bit about your experience in Wyoming that summer.
Speaker 2: Gee, I shouldn't tell you this.  This just makes me an awful--but then, I--it's the kind of varied life that I had.  One of the jobs that I had in Wyoming was playing music in a house of prostitution.  The women were there, the men would come in, I'd play music and they'd buy drinks, and then they could go off and get a room and have their evening of pleasure.  It was--it was a legalized house of prostitution.  And I'd come home at the end of night with my pockets just bulging with silver dollars.  Back then, out west, you took silver dollars because that helped the economy.  You didn't take paper.  You were against the--took silver dollars and my--I had a pocket full of silver dollars for the tips I got.  But, that's how I--that was--that's the beginning of my sordid life--of my sordid life in (laughter) in the world.
Story_ID: 614863
Speaker 1: You're at the University of Colorado [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado].  When you first started there, what was your expectation and what did you want to achieve after that?
Speaker 2: No expectation.  Going to school was just something that I decided I wanted to do.  I didn't even have an idea.  You see, we didn't have tutors and counselors and that sort of thing back then that talked to you beforehand and found out what you were interested in.  I didn't--I didn't--I didn't have anything.  I just--my dad [Claude Walton, Sr.] had always said that I--that he wanted me to get an education.  And so, all I thought about was that I--I'm going to go to--I'm going to go to school and get an education, I had no idea in what.  But, because I already had a background in music, when I went up to the University of Colorado, that's what I decided to go in.  And my original intent was to be an arranger and a conductor.  I had some exposure to that.  You know, being in music before, I had met arrangers and conductors and what not.  And I thought, boy, now, that's what I'd like to do, write music and arrange music.  And I had visions of one day having my studio and be sitting up in the studio writing out music or arranging, and that--and making myself a fortune writing music.  And so when I went up to university, I enrolled in the school of music [College of Music] and my degree was--would've been in music.
Story_ID: 614864
Speaker 1: How did you get into sports at--
Speaker 2: Well, that was--that was my--that was really my entree because, you see, there was--there was nothing for a musician up there and so far as school, so since I had been a track man in high school [West High School, Denver, Colorado], I thought, well, I'll go out for track.  I--as I say, I wasn't good.  I just had a little weight and a little--a little skill, and everything I learned, technically that I learned about my discus throwing, I learned at the university [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado].  I went out and had only my little high school experience, and the coach handed me the discus and said this is how you do it and this is the form, and handed me the shot and changed a few things that I had been doing or improve.  The event is totally different today than it was back then.  And, fortunately, I worked hard at it and developed and became the school discus thrower to the extent that the coach used his influence to get me off of the basketball team because he was afraid I'd get hurt and he didn't want his discus thrower and his shot putter hurt.  So, he told Iba [Henry Iba] that I--that he--and, of course, his--the fact that Iba told me what I would experience, it had no direct effect upon it, but I wasn't an outstanding basketball player either.  I was--I was just the fifth man on the floor, so there was no reason for him to make any serious objection about me not being on the team.  But, that's how I got into sports.  And the fact that I was able to develop and improve, it propelled me into the next level, and the next thing you knew, I was the school discus thrower.
Speaker 1: How was that sport at that time?
Speaker 2: Field sports--all the sports back then were just participating.  You see, today, you're influenced by the byproduct of your athletics, the money.  Today, you don't go to school for an education.  These guys don't go--they go for exposure to be able to sign on the dotted line for so many millions of dollars.  So, the idea is to go to the best school possible where they can get exposure to attract the scouts and get a pro contract.  But, as I said earlier, there were no sports--no pro sports back then, so there was nothing for you to do except go to school and get an education and then get a job or get a profession to pursue after you--after you left.  So, I didn't have any particular incentive to try to excel beyond the fact of personal satisfaction.  I wanted to do the best I could.  But, to that extent, there was no effort made on the part of coaches into, to develop the finer points of being an athlete, the finer points of developing your body and your muscles and the finer points of developing certain habits, your eating habits and your drinking habits and that sort of thing.  That didn't enter in because when you finished school, why you went out to whatever your training was.  So, you see, the goal at the end was to sort of prepare myself for whatever I had gone to school for, not for the sake of a pro scout picking me up and signing me.  So, that made a difference in my--in all of the approach to athletics.  Now, it's not a hidden fact.  I mean, they spend millions of dollars going around trying to find the best athletes from the nooks and corners of the world to come to school.
Story_ID: 614865
Speaker 1: When you first started there [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado], were you the only black athlete on the track team?
Speaker 2: At that time, yes.
Speaker 1: Were there any other black athletes in any other sports?
Speaker 2: I was the only black athlete in three states, Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah.  That made up the Rocky Mountain Conference [Rocky Mountain Faculty Athletic Conference; Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference], nobody else, nobody.
Speaker 1: In any sport?
Speaker 2: No one.
Speaker 1: Now, did that make you--I mean, in terms of traveling to those schools in that conference, how--was that similar to your experience that you talked about in high school [West High School, Denver, Colorado]?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, there isn't--there isn't a great deal of traveling involved--not--there wasn't then.  Your meets were held at the school, on the field, and you had a handful of spectators up there watching.  I mean, no big deal going to see a track meet, you know, unless you were Jesse Owens at Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] or something like that.  But, I mean, the--we didn't have any--as a matter of fact, the football players were mad at all the other athletes because they said, "We go out and earn all the money and you guys come and spend it all.  You don't earn anything."  So, it was--there was nothing--there was nothing to work up in the great amount of competitive spirit because, I mean, you were--you were--you were just competing and you went out and did the best you could and the--your opposition had the same approach.  And we didn't have any--we didn't have any great--as a matter of fact, it was more a camaraderie thing, and I said that what I learned from athletes.  It was not uncommon for the discus thrower or the javelin thrower or the shot putter to say, "You know, if you do this, you get more distance" or "If you do this, you may find something," and that's what it was.  And I mean, competition you wanted to win, but then the final line was that you--there, there was no greater reward other than winning.  I mean, it wasn't gonna take any money out of his pocket or limit his chances, so that's--that was the major difference.
Story_ID: 614866
Speaker 1: To go to school there [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado] as a high school athlete or high school student, what kind of academic background did you have in terms--
Speaker 2: Well, you had to--
Speaker 1: --of grades?
Speaker 2: You had to meet the entrance requirements.  And, of course, back then, one of the entrance requirements was that you had to have Latin and you had to have algebra (laughter) as subjects that you had completed in high school.  So, in addition to the usual things, Latin and algebra were two requirements, and I had to spend an additional year in high school because I didn't have enough math.  So, back then, it was a strict situation.  You didn't just decide to go.  You had to meet the requirements, scholastically, I mean.  You had to have certain subjects on your--on your--on your sheet that indicated and you had to have--you were expected to have some science.  Of course, this was taught as part of the regular school curriculum.  I mean, I had to have chemistry.  And, so all of those hard subjects were a requirement then.  There was no such thing as taking shop or taking gym and getting--you took English, Latin, algebra, geometry.  All of those were required subjects that you had to take to get out of high school in order to get into college.  And if you didn't have them, you didn't get in.  As I say, I didn't have enough algebra in my first year after I graduated [from West High School, Denver, Colorado].  I graduated actually in '32 [1932].  But I couldn't go to--couldn't go to school because I didn't have any, any math--have enough math.
Speaker 1: What kind of grades did you get in high school?
Speaker 2: I was no--I was a fair student.  I got Cs and Bs.  I'm no great personality.  I don't have any outstanding--I just--I have enough of everything to get me by at an acceptable level.  I knew that, I've known that, and I have accepted that as my status and, and I worked towards that.  I--the reason I gave up on music was that I did not have the dexterity in my fingers to be the piano player that I needed to be to make a living and that's how I have judged myself.  That's the reason that I--everybody, my wife [HistoryMaker Darwin McBeth Walton], my family is mad at me now because I don't do any more playing.  Never in my life was I able to execute on the piano to the degree that I had to if I were going to be that as a--as a professional, as a wage earner.  So, that's the way it was.  I had enough skills to get by and I've had enough skills throughout my life, fortunately, to get by.  I haven't been any outstanding person, I just--I've made it just above the average, just above the average with enough of an attitude to be acceptable.  I realized at the beginning that I was not going to be the greatest find or the greatest individual, and I didn't have an attitude about it and I didn't resent being told anything, and as a result, I've had a very successful life in that I have been able to work with people.
Story_ID: 614867
Speaker 1: You started out at the University of Colorado [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado] in the music--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) area.  How was that?  What was that experience like for you?
Speaker 2: Well, that was--that was what kept me in school because, as I say, I played these tea dances and I was good enough considering the competition on campus that if you didn't call me at least a week in advance, why I was booked.  So, I made--I made my money, my spending money at tea dances.  And that was not an acceptable fact in the music school [College of Music].  You see, back in my day, to a musician, you resolved your fifths or your sevenths.  You didn't leave a seventh hanging.  The story goes that this musician was in a hotel or a room and somebody in another room was playing and at the end of the song, they had a seventh chord and they resolved it.  And this individual sleeping in another room could not go to sleep that night because he kept waiting for that individual to resolve the seventh chord.  And this was--this was a--this was a requirement of music.  And in the middle of the night, he got up and went to the piano and resolved that seventh--that's the way it was, you know.  It was--it was a cut and dried--you didn't have the freedom, the leeway and sort of thing.  And I had--I could--I could do open, but I never had the dexterity in my fingers to do finger work.  So, when it came to the fine work of playing up and down the piano and execution, I never had that.  And I knew at that time that I never would be a musician.  There was no point in me pursuing it in life.  So, music became secondary in my life.  It served its purpose.  I appreciate my mother's [Jennie Woolridge Walton] insisting that I take music and it served me well.  It played a major role in my life, but I just was not meant to be a professional musician.  I was not given the tools necessary to be the kind of musician I would have to be in order to make a living at it.  If I had pursued music, I wouldn't be here now because, you know, I would've long since been burned out for nickel and dime jobs and joints and whatever went along, maybe getting high to keep up the spirit.  So, now everybody gets mad because I don't do much music.
Speaker 1: The music professors that you had at the--
Speaker 2: Oh, I started out to say that this was not acceptable on the campus because they were musicians.  They were strict musicians and the music standard, the music requirement was that this is what you do.  You see, back--I always had to keep reminding you that back in those days, you didn't have the freedom of anything that you have today.  You were very limited.  There were standards that had been set by the masters.  And if the masters required it, who were you to come along and change it?  So, if the master said that you resolve the seventh, you resolve the seventh.  Who were you to have a seventh and not resolve it?  So, it wasn't accepted.  My grade was marked down.  Parallel fifths.  If I put parallel fifths in my--in my music, my grade showed the effects of it because that was--that was wrong.  So, what I was doing was the more freelance sort of thing because, you see, jazz was just developing then.  Classical music, everything was compared to the classical music and the classical music was the standard.  So, because of the fact that I did not have the ability to do classical music the way it was written, I switched over and did more jazz and the classical music that I played was more along the--what was then called the modern music, chords and open, open, open chord playing and not finger playing.
Story_ID: 614868
Speaker 1: Who were your jazz influences?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew Duke Ellington.  Matter of fact, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You knew him personally?
Speaker 2: I had--yes, Duke was out to Denver [Colorado] a couple of times and I met him.  As a matter of fact, a good friend of mine was a musician in Denver, George Morrison, and one day, George had Duke over and we sat out on his front porch and talked about music, and Duke told us what made Duke Ellington, fascinating story.
Speaker 1: What did he tell you?
Speaker 2: The reason--one of the things that he did, he knew that he could not compete in the music world with the musicians then, so he wrote music, and Duke played Duke's music.  Rarely did Duke play any other than Duke's music, and he did it over and over.  He struggled during the--during the early times because, you see, that was--that was not acceptable music.  I told you that that was not--that was not what the masters did and who was Duke Ellington to come along and think that he could have parallel fifths or had--didn't have to resolve a seventh?  And so he said that--he said that, "If I were going to go into music that this is what I'd better do."  And that was a great influencing factor.  As a matter of fact, when Duke came back here, I used to go down to the theater.  I knew--I dated a relative of his--of one of his--of his trumpet player, a woman that--a girl that lived in Chicago [Illinois], and I would go down to the theater and go back stage and I guess Darwin [Walton's wife, HistoryMaker Darwin McBeth Walton] got to know him later on, but I knew him back when he first made his--when he made his first record--I mean, his first movie.  And I never will forget, 'Three Little Words,' and his drummer, name slips me, but I never will forget him playing these chimes in the back when--'Three Little Words,' and--Sonny Greer, Sonny Greer was his drummer.  And, boy, that really impressed me.  That's what I really wanted to be.  I thought that that was just going to be a great life, to be a musician.  But what goes on behind the scenes or what goes on in the seclusion of your own room is another thing and I realized that, Walton [HistoryMaker Claude Walton], you don't have the--you don't have the tools and I was no great mind at composing music, so there I--but I knew Duke.  One of the few--I knew most of the musicians back then because I was in music and I played in what then was one of the finest bands in Denver.
Story_ID: 614869
Speaker 1: We were talking a little bit about your music--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in college [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado].  You never got--did you get a degree in music or what kind of music were you actually studying?
Speaker 2: I (laughter) I hate to get into this because this is another--all right.  I--you--you've asked me and this, this is--this is the only way I can answer it is to tell you what happened.  First of all, I'll remind you that we're still in the midst of the Depression [Great Depression] when people were standing in long lines, soup lines to get food, when there were no jobs of any kind available.  This is in 19 and '35 [1935], '36 [1936], '37 [1937].  I had completed--I had--I had won my gold medal at the nationals in '35 [1935 NCAA Track and Field Championships] and was going back to the nationals in '36 [1936 NCAA Track and Field Championships], which were being held at Stagg Field in Chicago [Amos Alonzo Stagg Field, Chicago, Illinois].  And the nationals were being held there, so that's where I was going to eventually wind up, from the--from Colorado as I had already qualified at Colorado for the nationals.  Are you with me so far?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: All right.  So, I was going to come to Chicago [Illinois] for, for that national meet that was the last meet before going to New York for the finals of the Olympic [1936 Summer Olympics, Berlin, Germany].  What happened was that a club in Chicago known as the Old Timers club decided to have a fundraiser to raise funds for the Olympics.  You know, everybody has a fundraiser.  And so they scheduled an invitational track meet to be held at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and they invited the outstanding black athletes at that time, including Jesse Owens, Ralph Metcalfe, Eulace Peacock, Ben Johnson-
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: --all those fellas to come back and compete just for this fundraiser at the University of Chicago.  Me being an oddity, number one, I was a discus thrower and we were not supposed to be anything other than runners and jumpers, and I was from Colorado where the Indians [Native American] were still in control out there.  Why, I was invited and the fact that I had competed in the nationals in Berkeley [California] the year before, I was invited to come back and participate in that meet, which I did.  It was held at Soldier--at Stagg and--on a Saturday, and my coach said to me before I came back, "Now, the nationals are going to be there and there's no point in you going out for this invitational meet a week ahead and then coming back here and then going back a week later.  So, we're gonna let you stay in Chicago for this week--for that week, but I want you to not get into any trouble.  I don't want you to do anything to cause a problem."  Okay, so I--after competing on a--on a Saturday night--on a Saturday at Stagg Field, one of the individuals said, look, we have a little fun game of, of softball that we play on Sunday morning in Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois].  Why don't you come on out and, and play ball with us?  And I thought, boy, this is just what the coach would like.  I'll go out and play softball Sunday morning.  So, Sunday morning I'm out at Washington Park, my first introduction to the park district [Chicago Park District], incidentally, and we had this game.  And I managed to get a hit and, and rounded the base, thought I was going to get into home and found out that I couldn't make it, so I ran back and slid into third base.  The bases were wooden blocks about that high in the form of a base nailed into the ground.  So, they didn't move.  And I slid into third and slid into that base and sprained my ankle, my right ankle, the ankle I do my turning on, everything.  Here I am, sprained ankle.  Well to make a long story short, I competed in the nationals at that time.  I did not qualify to go to New York because I had this (background noise), this sprained ankle.  I couldn't, couldn't do anything.
Story_ID: 614870
Speaker 1: I had this ankle injury, I couldn't go to New York, so I decided to stay in Chicago [Illinois] and spend the summer.  But just prior to that, I met an individual at the track meet, an influential politician in Chicago at that time, Mike Sneed [Edward Sneed], who was a 3rd Ward committeeman and Mike must've liked my looks or something or other.  Anyway, he said, "You know, you're the kind of young man we could use back here."  He said, "You ought to--you ought to consider coming to Chicago."  I said, "No, I'm gonna go to New--."  "Well, give it some thought.  We--and if you wanna--if you wanna come back, why I'll look out after you."  Well, of course, that didn't mean a great deal to me then because I didn't know what all the politics were.  So, I stayed here, spent the summer, and at the end of the summer, I left and went back to Colorado for my final year [at the University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado].  Having no plans, nothing, nothing in mind, nothing available, it dawned upon me that Mike Sneed had invited me to come back to Chicago and that he would look out after me.  So, the first thing I did when I graduated--I didn't graduate, the school year was over, I needed I think two or three hours, was to catch a train and come back here.  And true to his word, I got back here at the beginning of the summer.  He gave me a job at the beach--I opened 31st Street Beach [Chicago, Illinois] when they built it.  I was an attendant there.  I worked the summer and Mike said to me at the end of the summer, he said, "Now, you're a brand new person.  You're an outsider."  He said, "I've got hundreds of people here, of my--of my--of my voters that need jobs."  He said, "I can't do anything for you right now, but you stay here and keep yourself together and I won't forget you."  This was the best offer that I had at the time any place.  I had no place else to go.  So, I stayed here and two years, three years later, one summer, Mike called me on the phone and said, "Come down to my office," and I did.  He said, "I've got a job at the Chicago Park District for an instructor.  Do you know anything about that?"  And I said, "Yes, I know what it is, recreation and gymnastics and that sort of thing."  He said, "All right, you take this letter and go down to the ed [education] building and give it to them."  I did.  I got a job as an instructor at the Chicago Park District in 1940 for what then was considered a political plum, $160 a month, which in 1940 was a lot of money.  That started me.  I got involved in that job and forty-five years later, I'm still at--now, to bring you up to date of what happened in the meantime, because I got into the job, I had a good job, paid me good money, I did not go back to Colorado to get my degree, so I'm still a couple of hours short.  All of these years have gone by and I did not do anything about getting a degree and as a result, the hall of fame [University of Colorado Athletic Hall of Fame], which was started years later, had a basic requirement that in order to go into the hall of fame, you had to have your degree.  Regardless to who you were, what you had done, nothing counted except a degree.  This year, they changed that regulation and eliminated the degree and they inducted me two weeks ago at the hall of fame.  The reason that I did not get my degree, come back and get my degree in 1937 was that I had this job in Chicago, which I wouldn't have had otherwise, so all those years I never got my degree.  And all of those years, and one of the things they made mention of two weeks ago, was the reason that I was not in the hall of fame before was that I did not qualify because I didn't have my degree.  So, I did not get my degree, I still don't have it.  They're talking about giving me an honorary degree, but I still don't have it because what got in the way of my graduating was a job which made my life career for me.  I couldn't--I couldn't have done any better (laughter) in the world financially than I did as a result of keeping the job because I kept going up the ladder.

Speaker 1: Now, let's go back to your, your athletic career at the University of Colorado [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --a little bit.  You were an outstanding discus thrower.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you set some records there.  Can you tell us a little bit about--
Speaker 2: No, I--well, yeah, I set records but then--see, sports were so new and such a--such a low level I should say, not highly concentrated as they are today.  Sports is a major industry in the--in the world today.  Back then, sports was a sideline.  I mean, you went out for sports as a diversion.  And so you didn't put forth any special effort.  Records didn't mean a great deal.  I held the record at the university, but then there had been no great record before that.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what your record was?
Speaker 2: A hundred and fifty-seven feet, the record that got me--that won me the national--or got me the gold medal in the nationals [1935 NCAA Track and Field Championships].  I keep saying won because back then, they gave two gold medals for--they gave two medals for each place.  Today, they only give one.  Back then, first and second got a gold, third and fourth got a silver, and fifth and sixth got a bronze.  I was second in the discus and I got a gold.  So, that was my--that was the record that I set then and that was a school record.  I don't know what the national record then--the national record then was a hundred and sixty-some feet I think because in the--in--particularly in the South and in the West, those guys were really working on discus throwers.  I mean, there were a lot of--a lot of foreigners there, people from foreign countries where they specialized in weight events.  You know, you see the world's strongest men, they--and they developed, and so the records were generally held by California or somebody in the South.  So, I think the--I think the world record then was a hundred and sixty-four feet.  But, that record stood at Colorado, I don't know how long.  I--years later, I went up there and my record was still standing.  And I don't know what the conference record was because, as I say, it wasn't something that was too important.
Speaker 1: But you were a conference champion a couple of times also, weren't you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was an outstanding thing back then, me getting--me getting a second place or a gold medal in California was a big thing back then.  It made the headline of The Denver Post that [HistoryMaker] Claude Walton is in second place.  Well, I guess I was in first place at the end of the trials and then the second day, somebody, somebody threw a better one.  But, that was--that was a big thing back then.
Speaker 1: And what year was that?
Speaker 2: Nineteen thirty-five [1935].
Speaker 1: And you were also an All-American.
Speaker 2: That's what made me an All-American.  The fact that I got a place in the nationals--if you--if you win in the--if you--the first place, now it's a gold medal, the first--then you qualify for the All-American.  So, the fact that I got a gold medal in 1935 qualified me to be--and the following year, I was featured in sports magazine, the picture--I had a picture in there saying that I was the number two discus thrower in the country.
Story_ID: 614872
Speaker 1: While you were at the University of Colorado [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado] running track, you had a couple of fairly well known classmates.  Could you tell us a little bit about them?
Speaker 2: The--probably the most famous one, undoubtedly most famous athlete that Colorado has had was Byron White [Byron R. White].  Byron was from a little town outside of Denver [Colorado], brilliant individual.  When I went to Colorado, his brother was there, Clayton White [Clayton S. White], who also was a brilliant individual, a Rhodes scholar.  Byron came along and followed his brother and became a Rhodes scholar.  He came back and went to--he went to Oxford [University of Oxford, Oxford, England] and he came back and went to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and was a schoolmate of, of, of John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] and ran Kennedy's political campaign in Denver when he was running for president, and as a result, was appointed a [U.S.] Supreme Court justice, and was just a great guy.  Several years ago, I was in Washington [D.C.] for a pension fund convention, and there's another story (laughter).  But, they do have these conventions and I was in Washington for a--pension fund convention, decided one morning, well, I'll call up Byron and say hello to him.  So, I called the office and they asked me who I was and I told them who I--so, I told them who I was and what I wanted.  So, they put me through to Byron.
Speaker 1: And he was on the Supreme Court at this time?
Speaker 2: He was on the Supreme Court then.  We talked on the phone for a while and Byron said to me, "You know, we're in session now.  We've got a heavy schedule and I don't have a lot of time, a lot of leeway, and I can't take you out to lunch.  Supposing that you come on up to the building, Supreme Court Building [Washington, D.C.], I will order lunch served in my office and we can eat and talk about our days at CU?"  I went up to the Supreme Court, Byron and I had lunch in his office.  After lunch, he said, "How would you like to tour the building?"  He took me on a tour of the Supreme Court Building.  He took me into the deliberation chamber where the--all of the judges meet to deliberate their, their, their cases.  Then he said, "If you have nothing else to do, how would you like to sit in on a case?"  They had--along the wall up at the front of the Supreme Court, they had some booths--they had some booths.  They may still have or they don't have.  He got me a booth.  I sat in and listened and watched the Supreme Court in action, and that's my story.
Speaker 1: What event did he run at?
Speaker 2: He was a football player and a basketball player.
Speaker 1: And how did you two get connected?
Speaker 2: We were--we were together.  Well, I was on the--you know, I'm an athlete, we were all at this and the--and we were friendly.  We had a good relationship.  I had no problems with anybody.  There wasn't anybody on the team, anybody in the school that I didn't get along with.  And I just point that out to say--and I said--told the story and I said, "That's just an illustration of the human side of Byron White, the Supreme Court justice whom everybody thinks of as--." I said, "He was just a regular guy, great individual."  I have a picture of him, of the three of us, the three athletes of the year out there, Byron White, Gil Cruter, my buddy who was a high jumper, and myself, taken at one of the events, and we were the three top athletes at the University of Colorado back at that time.
Story_ID: 614873
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about Gil Cruter.
Speaker 2: Gil Cruter--Gil Cruter and I go back to high school.  Gil went to West High [West High School, Denver, Colorado] and was a high jumper over there.  He isn't in that picture because I don't think Gil was on the team at that time.  But, he was at West, was the high jumper, and when he finished West, he came to Boulder [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado] where I was, and he was the number two black athlete to earn a letter.  He was a high jumper.  And they had a indoor meet at Boulder in which he broke the world record and held it.  In New York [New York] at the same time at the Madison Square Garden, they were holding an indoor meet and somebody up there broke the record within an hour after he had broken it.  So, for one hour, why he was a world record holder in the high jump.  But, Gil was my--Gil was my buddy and I--rather than take up time, but I won't take up time, I--he died here a few years ago.  I got a beautiful story of him and a picture.  But, he is the number two man as an athlete at the--at the university.
Story_ID: 614874
Speaker 1: Over the years, have you followed Colorado sports?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I have a--well, as I say, I was the--I was inducted into the Living Legends, the first group in there.  There were seventy-five of us.  Byron White [Byron R. White] was, was one of the individuals.  There were--there were--I bragged about this fact.  All of us were over seventy years of age.
Speaker 1: Tell us what the Living Legends is.
Speaker 2: That's what--the Living Legends are individuals who earned a letter more than fifty--that, that are still alive fifty years later.  You earn a letter and if fifty years later you are still alive, they vote you into the Living Legends.  We were all over seventy.  There wasn't a cane or a crutch in the group.  We were called down on the--introduced on the field at halftime, we came down, and the same as two weeks ago when I was--the fans in the stand gave us an ovation.  And that's what the Living Legends.  So, every year, they hold an induction and every year, somebody becomes eligible.  A fifty--a fifty year later athlete is inducted and they are given a plaque.
Speaker 1: When you earned your letter, was there a ceremony around--
Speaker 2: No, no.  You earned the letter.  You had to gain--get so many points, which means you had to win or you had to finish.  You had to finish in your event enough to get a point, first, second, or third.  You accrued so many points during the season and if you had enough points, then you earned a letter.  That was the basis for receiving an athletic award, was that you--that you earned--you competed--you met the requirement to earn a letter whatever the sport was.  If you were basketball, you had to play so many quarters or so many halves, if you were football, so many quarters, whatever.  You had to--you had to earn it by actually competing for a certain period of time.
Speaker 1: So, you were the first black athlete to earn a letter at the University of Colorado [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado].
Speaker 2: A major letter, yeah.  There were two other athletes who earned minor letters.  They earned--they earned a little C and they were tumblers.  These were two fellas--and I told you there were six of us.  Well, two of the six were tumblers and one was from Kansas City [Missouri] and the other was from St. Louis [Missouri].  And I--for years, I thought of their--one was named Evans [ph.] and I can't think of the other.  But, they were--they were tumblers and they got--they got--they got small Cs.  But, no major letters.
Story_ID: 614875
Speaker 1: You said there were six of you.
Speaker 2: Six men, no women on the campus.  Six men at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]--I mean, at the University of Colorado [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado], there were six men, six African American on campus.  That was all.  No women.
Speaker 1: When you say six men, was that six men in the entire university?
Speaker 2: In the entire--I said on campus, on campus, no others, nobody else.
Speaker 1: And was that the whole (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Back then--
Speaker 1: --period you--
Speaker 2: Back then, there were--at that time, there were about five thousand students on campus, twenty-five thousand now, but back then, there were about five thousand.
Speaker 1: And during the four years you were there, did that number ever increase?
Speaker 2: Gil Cruter came along after.  The personnel changed.  A couple of the guys quit and went away.  One individual dropped out of school.  We were sitting up in the room one night and he looked in the paper and they advertised for a page in Washington [D.C.] and he wanted, wanted to apply to become a page in Washington.  And he applied to the congressman out in Denver [Colorado] and he got a job as a--spent the rest of his life in Washington, going from one job to another.  The other individual quit and went to Denver to the law school, but we never had any more than the three--than the six.
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned that you were just a few credit hours short of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --graduating--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --or getting your degree.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did any of these--the, the six--
Speaker 2: I think all the other--I think everybody else graduated.  The other--the other four individuals were all from out of state.  None of the--well, one more.  The sixth individual was a student--was a--was a student because his mother was the housekeeper for the president of the university, and she lived down on Goss in Boulder [Colorado].  And as a result of her employment, he went to school for nothing, and he was the other student.  Jim Chrysler [ph.] was his name and his mother was the--was the housekeeper at the, at the president's house.  The other--the other--one individual--other individual from Denver, two individuals from, I think Missouri and St.--and Kansas City [Missouri], and well, of course, I named Jim and myself two other individuals that worked at the frat house [Chi Psi Fraternity].  So, there were three of us at the frat house and three more who lived off campus, lived down on Goss Street because as I say, you couldn't live on--there were no places for you on campus.  So, those three individuals including these two individuals that I told you were tumblers.  So, three of us were on campus and three were living down the hill.
Story_ID: 614876
Speaker 1: We're starting where we left off talking about your employment with the Chicago Park District.  You're, you're--and you are Claude, [HistoryMaker] Claude Walton, correct?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right.  Okay.  All right.  So, let--let's, let's start talking about then, yeah.
Speaker 2: In 1940, I was hired by the Chicago Park District as a phys ed [physical education] instructor, which is the designation given to the recreation employee departments at that time.  And my first assignment was at Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois].  At that time, we were required to work two parks if the--if one park did not have two gymnasiums, one for men and one for--one for boys and one for girls.  So, my first assignment was at Washington Park and then I was assigned to Ada Park, which is out in Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois].  The reason for the--for the lateness was that Ada Park was brand new and was just finished, so when it was completed, I had the assignment of working Ada Park, which had one gymnasium and Washington Park, which had one gymnasium.  So, I worked three days at one park and three days at the other park.  This--cut it off a minute, can you?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll pause a second.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: I worked--I worked two parks, Washington and Ada.  At that time, there were only--there were only five black parks, Washington Park, Ada Park located in--at 113th [Place] and Ada [Street] in Morgan Park, Union Park [Chicago, Illinois] which was located at Ashland [Avenue] and Lake [Street]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, near United Center [Chicago, Illinois], yeah.
Speaker 1: --and Stanford Park [Chicago, Illinois] which was located on the West Side at around 15th [Street] or 16th Street.  That park disappeared once they put the expressway through and is no longer there.
Story_ID: 614877
Speaker 1: We had these five parks and then the neighborhood changed up north around what became Cabrini Green [Chicago, Illinois] and Seward Park [Chicago, Illinois] became a sort of a in between location where we had still white--where we still had white participants and black participants.  So, at Seward Park, we had a white female instructor and I was the black male instructor.  As--are we taping?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: As parks--as participation in parks changed, the--it became necessary--and when I say changed, I mean when it changed from one racial makeup to another, it became necessary to change the park staff.  So, I was assigned to Seward Park up north, which had a white female instructor and I was a--the male instructor.  And this was the first integration of personnel in the recreation department of the Chicago Park District.
Speaker 2: Was there any trouble associated with that transition?
Speaker 1: No, no trouble.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was just that the--it was just that the majority of the participants were white.  And what actually happened was that the instructor, the white instructor that was there was assigned to another white park and that left a vacancy at Seward Park, and I filled that vacancy.  And since the participants, the majority of the participants at that time going to Seward Park were black.  Seward Park was located in the--in the area six of the Chicago Park District, which is--includes the whole North Side from the lake [Lake Michigan] over to probably, probably Western [Avenue].  And Seward Park was the--was the only black park in area six.  It was a little difficult at that time, taking the teams since the parks competed between themselves, taking the team from Seward Park say maybe to La Follette Park [Chicago, Illinois], which was white because we were then in a white neighborhood, totally white, and the only blacks there were my team.  So, at times, it was a little tense in that things were said and little incidents happened, nothing of major consequence, but little things that made you feel uncomfortable or sort of unsure of your safety.
Story_ID: 614878
Speaker 1: I know that when--even when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came here in '66 [1966], he said that Chicago [Illinois] was one of the most segregated cities in the country.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I guess in 1940, it certainly (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --probably would've been.
Speaker 2: The Chicago Park District was very, very segregated.  No bones were made about it.  The black parks had only blacks and the white parks had only whites and, and when you--when you had to take your team into a white park which was located in a white neighborhood, then, of course, you had to come in contact with the--with neighborhood in general and sometimes the tension was a little high.  Fortunately, we never had any major incidents because we would go in, play our game or do our event, and then we would leave right away.  And this was the accepted practice because of the times.  Gradually as the neighborhoods changed and as I said the staff changed, the expansion of the black population in the south areas of the city caused a somewhat rapid change in the functions of the Chicago Park District.  Because as soon as the neighborhood changed a bit, then it became necessary to find staff to service that area.  So, I probably--I worked at--I worked at Welles Park [Chicago, Illinois], which was located in the midst of the--I'm sorry, I didn't mean Welles Park.  I worked at Madden Park which was located in the heart of the Wells, Ida B. Wells housing project [Ida B. Wells Homes, Chicago, Illinois].  And the pattern then was not to mix the staff, to try to make the staff and the program suitable for the new occupants of the--of that community.  So, the employment, the black employment in the park district began to increase substantially as these neighborhood parks changed their makeup from one race to another.  This was pretty much confined to the South Side, so gradually, most of the parks south of 22nd Street all the way out to Ada Park [Chicago, Illinois] which was located at 115th [sic.] began to see changes taking place because the neighborhoods began to change their racial makeup.  I remained an instructor for about ten or fifteen years and during that period of time, I was assigned as a playground supervisor to Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois], which had just opened the first major new park on the South Side.
Story_ID: 614879
Speaker 1: This is what, about 1955?
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.  Nineteen fifty-five [1955], Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois] was opened as the first, certainly one of the first parks and a major--Washington Park itself being a major park had a little dinky field house in which you stood in the--in the middle of the gym and shot longshots at the basket, which was half a court away.  It was just very small.  And--
Speaker 1: But, how big is--give--I mean, Washington Park is a huge park with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It is now.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But when I--as I--I have to go back a bit.  I said that my first assignment was at Washington Park.  When I started at Washington Park in 1940, it just had this little dinky field house, which had a gym probably no more than fifty feet.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I heard what you were saying.  But, in the new--the field house that was erected in '55 [1955], is the one we see now, the big one--
Speaker 2: That's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) with the natatorium and all that.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now--
Speaker 1: But, but--
Speaker 2: --the only thing at--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --Washington Park that was outstanding at the time I started was the swimming pool.  The swimming pool in Washington Park had been constructed during the WPA [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration] days by the WPA workers.  And it was--it was not one pool, it was three pools.  It was a regulation swimming pool, a diving pool, and what would be considered a wading pool.  The two--the swimming pool and the wading pool were about the same size.  And at the far end of the swimming pool was a special diving pool.  The only reason that I mention that is that in 19--in 19 probably '41 [1941] I think, the women's national swimming meet was held in Washington Park because of the fact that that was the only Olympic size pool east of California.
Story_ID: 614880
Speaker 1: All of the outstanding women swimmers in the country were brought to Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois] to compete in the national swim meet.
Speaker 2: Now, I've heard--now, tell me if I'm wrong or not, but I've heard that that park had something to do with one of the Olympics at one time and that Johnny Weissmuller had swum in that--had swam in that pool at--
Speaker 1: No, it was--it was Esther Williams--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --was the outstanding female swimmer at the time and she competed at Washington Park in the--in the national swim meet.  Johnny Weissmuller was hired by the Chicago Park District to teach the park district instructors swimming or to give them the fine points and to better prepare them to be instructors and that sort of thing.  So, he was hired as a specialist on a temporary basis, and that was his connection back then.
Speaker 2: And that was in the--was that in the '50s [1950s] or '60s [1960s] or when?
Speaker 1: That was--that was in the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: At that time, the park district was noted for preparing its staff to conduct, instruct, and supervise all types of activity, physical activity.  And if you were not familiar with that--whatever particular sport or activity that was--that was necessary, the park district had institutes which they taught the instructors how to--how to conduct this activity, not to the professional level, but to the level of being able to give the participants a basic knowledge of what it was.  For example, we taught swimming.  We didn't teach them how to do all the fancy things, but we taught swimming so that in an emergency or even in pleasure, they could swim.  They didn't jump in the pool and drown.  And we did this in every sport.  In tennis, we would bring in a professional tennis player to instruct our park district instructors in the basics of that sport.  And this was one of the things that made the park district such an efficient organization at that time was because all of the instructors were given training to keep them abreast of whatever was required to meet the needs of the participants coming in.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, was it a--was it a, you think a--kind of a publicity move on the part of the park district to hire a man like Johnny Weissmuller so they could say--
Speaker 1: No, well he was--
Speaker 2: --well, Johnny Weissmuller taught us how to swim.
Speaker 1: --he was in Chicago [Illinois] then, I guess, and being well known and whatnot--
Speaker 2: He was well known as Tarzan in the movies.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And being here, why he was hired, and that helped.  We--I'm trying to think of other individuals that were hired to do a specialty job of whatever their specialty was.
Story_ID: 614881
Speaker 1: Did they try to go for people that had name recognition as well as skill or just--was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They--
Speaker 1: --the skill sufficient or?
Speaker 2: They would bring in people that might not have national recognition.  They would be people that had recognition but were local people.  So, this meant that they didn't spend a lot of money bringing in people.  I mean, there was no need for--all the park district [Chicago Park District] was interested in was that the individual be able to teach the park district staff how to do the basic requirements of whatever activity they had to do.  And as I say, we had--we had wrestlers that would come in and teach wrestling, we had tennis players that would come in, and particularly was this true in the--in the--in the active sports, which brings me to the point of saying that the entire recreation--park district recreational staff were trained instructors.  You were required to have a degree in--or hours, credit hours in physical ed [physical education], and you might--you might have been a specialist in a sport of your own and you got a job with the park district.  So, in order to prepare you to conduct the type of classes that were conducted at that time, why that's when the park district would step in and teach you how--and this was done through institutes, were--which were held three or four times a year in which all of the instructors in the park district would go to one location.  For example, when we had Johnny Weissmuller here as a swimming instructor, the classes were conducted at Austin Town Hall [Austin Town Hall Park, Chicago, Illinois], which was at--which is at Lake [Street] and Central [Avenue] because that was one of the few sort of centrally located indoor swimming pools, had an indoor swimming pool that everybody could come to and get instructions.  This certainly helped to open up the park district in so far as the working conditions were concerned because at these institutes, we all came together.  We got the same instruction and we went back and prepared our teams to participate in the total park district program.  So much probably for my--for my instructor's days, we--after, after putting in so many literally years as an instructor, you sort of became qualified to move up to the next level, which was park supervisor.  Every park had its own supervisor who was in charge of that park and depending upon the facility of the--that the park had to offer, the physical facility would determine what instructors they would have.  Now, they all had gymnasiums.  Some had two gyms in which case they would have a male and female.  We had craft shops in which individuals could do craft work, machine work, cabinet making.  We had photography shops.  We had dressmaking.  We hired a seamstress to conduct those classes.  So, the park district was a--it was a pretty unique organization in that it provided instructors to teach the participants, which was the general public, to do anything that might be requested.
Story_ID: 614882
Speaker 1: I know one thing that surprised me when I came to Chicago [Illinois] and I came to Chicago thirty years ago is that the people were talking about how they used to teach and they probably were still doing it someplace, square dancing--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in the parks, and it was very--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --popular in the black community.
Speaker 2: Very popular, yes.  As a matter of fact, one of the--one of the instructors who was a--who was a--who was an Olympian in 1932, I think, as a broad jump was Johnny Brooks [John Brooks].  John was the--was an instructor in the park district [Chicago Park District] and he was one of the--one of the top square dance callers and participants at that time and had quite a large class of square dancers.  These were the sorts of activities that would--the park district would hire a professional square dance caller to come in and teach the instructors how to--how to conduct that.  As I said, they built their reputation on providing recreational activities for all ages and all conditions, handicap, physically handicap, mentally handicap.  Whomever came into the park was able to find an activity that he could participate in.
Story_ID: 614883
Speaker 1: I was asking you off camera about the size of Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois].  It's a huge park that covers several acres.  I don't know how many acres, but it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's--
Speaker 1: --big.
Speaker 2: Well, in, in terms of--I can't tell you--well, I can tell you.
Speaker 1: It's blocks and blocks.
Speaker 2: It goes from--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: 50th [sic. 51st Street] then King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive] on the--to--
Speaker 1: That's on the west end of it, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: On the west end to 60th [Street] and from King Drive to Cottage Grove [Avenue] on the east.  So, it's that entire ten block area.
Speaker 1: That's a big--that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That takes up Washington Park.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  There's a lagoon there and--
Speaker 2: There was a lagoon.  There was not only a lagoon, but then they had boats on the lagoon that you could rent and take your date out and, and, and paddle around the lagoon.  On the east side, they had lighted croquet courts (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, that's something that doesn't exist anymore.
Speaker 2: Doesn't exist.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They had--they had a roped off archery range and this was all within Washington Park and all the conducted activity (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 614884
Speaker 1: The tendency today is to think that the parks and everything else are better than they used to be.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But that's not necessarily true, is it?
Speaker 2: The parks were better then than they are today because, you see, unfortunately, one of the things that hurt--that has hurt the park--the parks the most is the emergence of gangs.  And a gang in the park area not only affects the immediate community, but it affects the park because the kids all go to the--to the--to the park and the gangs are--tend to infiltrate and take over.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, they consider the park their territory after a while--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: --and becomes--
Speaker 2: And so anybody that does not live in their community can't come in and use that park because that's their territory.  So, that has hurt the parks more than anything in the world.  And the fact that back then, we had our own police force.  The--you see--did you know that all of the--
Speaker 1: Well, that--this speaks to--
Speaker 2: Did you know that all of the boulevards in the City of Chicago [Illinois] were the property of the--of the Chicago Park District?
Speaker 1: I did not know that.
Speaker 2: All of the boulevards.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All over the city, the boulevards were all part of the park district and lead into some park.
Story_ID: 614885
Speaker 1: Sir, that raises an issue that I wanted to discuss and that's the power, the political power of the Chicago Park District.  It's a huge organization, right, with the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.  The park district is a municipality within the municipality.  The park district is a creation of the state and that's where it gets its power, through the state legislature.  When the citizens of--when the residents of Chicago [Illinois] pay their taxes in that--in that tax bill will be a slot of the Chicago Park District that goes directly to the park district.  So, the park does not have to go to the city, to the city administration to get its funds, and that made it totally independent of the City of Chicago.  Now, in order to give the city some control, the state required--or the state allowed the city to appoint the commissioners that run the park district.  There--the park district is literally run by the commissioners who are appointed by the mayor.  So, that gives the mayor of the City of Chicago an input into the park district because he appoints the commissioners and the commissioners in turn hire the superintendent, who is a paid person.  Commissioners do not get paid, but they have the authority to hire the park district.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: So, that's where the city gets its input.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know when--back in the late, I guess in the '70s [1970s], you had a situation that had been going on for a long time where you had Mayor Daley [Richard J. Daley] who was a powerful mayor, some--many called him a boss--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --type mayor.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: His top two--you know, his right and his left hand were the park district commissioner, Ed Kelly and then the--who was the Cook County commissioner?  That was--
Speaker 2: George Dunne [George W. Dunne].
Speaker 1: George Dunne, yeah.  So, that, there--that made a triumvirate of--
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact--
Speaker 1: --jobs and--
Speaker 2: --George Dunne was originally a park district man.  George Dunne, a great friend of mine, was my park--was my area supervisor when I was an instructor at Seward Park [Chicago, Illinois], and George and I became very good friends.  That was when he was just plain old George Dunne and he went up from there to be a power in the city.
Speaker 1: Yeah, county commissioner, yeah.
Speaker 2: County commissioner, president.  But, the thing that made the park district--that enabled the park district to function the way that it did was because they didn't have to go to the city council [Chicago City Council] and present their program or their need and then wait for the council to vote them the funds.  They received their money directly.  Now, what does happen is that they had to go to the state legislature in order to receive any increases.  So, when we--when the park district needed more money, instead of going to the city, they went to the state legislature and that--that's where the approval or rejection was made.
Speaker 1: So, that's--you know, we reflect back on what you said earlier, that the park district had its own police force.
Speaker 2: This was--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay.  We were talking about the Chicago Park District before the light blew out and--we were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --we were--so, we were just talking about the power--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --that the Chicago Park District--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --has as a--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --as a entity that's not directly controlled--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --by the city.
Speaker 1: Well, that gave the park district its power.  Back then, the commissioners as I say were the appointed officials to oversee the park district as a whole to give the City of Chicago some input because the commissioners, as I say, hired the superintendent.  The budget was made up for the park district that the commissioners would approve and then it was submitted to the state not the city.  And the state legislature would then designate what the levy for the park district would be.  So, the only input that the city had was the ability to select the commissioners, but the actual funding of the--total park district operation was under the control of the state, the state legislature.
Story_ID: 614886
Speaker 1: Tell me, now, what were some of the--over the years, what were--what issues or concerns did the black community have about the Chicago Park District?
Speaker 2: The--as the population changed in the area and we moved in, we inherited the facility that was in that area.  However, in an area where there were--there were no facilities, when we moved in, we didn't have any parks.  So, you see, the only parks that we had back then were parks that had originally been white.  Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois] was all white.  And it, it wasn't until year--I was an instructor there before it really began to change.  The east side of Washington Park was all white.  That's where I told you they had the pool--the boat--the little lake.
Speaker 1: And the archery range and--
Speaker 2: The archery.  And so the concern of the black population was to get a park, which meant that they'd have to go to the city or go to the park district and lobby the commissioners to establish a park in there and that's where the--that's where the rub was--came about was that it was--it was difficult to get the commissioners to do that because this meant an additional allocation of funds.  However, it had to happen because, as I say, as the community became established, they had to have a recreational--some sort of recreation there.  And that's why in the earlier stages, many of the--most of the recreation on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] was through the playground system, which was owned by the city, and this throws another wrinkle into it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The city had one block or two block playgrounds.  You've seen them around the city, the little, little play lot and that sort of--where they had swings and that sort of thing, no big facility, just little play--and a little, little dinky house for whatever limited--well, really table games sort of thing that they could conduct in the wintertime.  But, that's what was on the South Side.  They didn't have any field houses.  So, this became a bone of contention because to get a field house, you had to have a large enough area and since we took over most of these areas from the, from the original occupants, they made arrangements for that.  That was part of their planning.
Story_ID: 614887
Speaker 1: From the late '70s [1970s] until just recently, a lot of the parks, the field houses that existed in the black community were left to kind of deteriorate.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: One was the 63rd Street Beach House [Chicago, Illinois] that was in disuse for maybe ten, twelve years, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well you see now, for example, the 63rd Street Beach was a conflict because there were still whites over there in control (laughter).  At, at one time, there was just a little section of the 63rd beach that you could go to and that 55th--the fifty--57th Street Beach, which is right there by the Museum of Science and Industry [Chicago, Illinois], that was--that was pretty much where we went, and that didn't have any field house.  The field house was down at--in--at 60th [Street], 62nd [Street], down in there where they have that big field house.  But, you see, I opened 31st Street Beach [Chicago, Illinois] when it was built in 1940.  That was my--I mean in 1937.  That was my first job when I came back to Chicago [Illinois].  I told you that I was talked in--and, and, and when I graduated from CU [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado], I came immediately to Chicago and in 1937, oh, 31st, 31st Street Beach was built and I got a job.  I was assigned down there as an--as an attendant.  Back in those days, you came to the beach and changed your clothes and put them in a little basket and into the beach house where they had attendants.  And that was the--that was the first beach on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] for blacks.  Then, they gradually--they gradually moved in Washington [Washington Park, Chicago, Illinois].  Now, the other thing that happened in the Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] days since we didn't have a beach, they started building beaches in the large parks.  And, for example, in Garfield--in Douglas Park [Chicago, Illinois] and in Garfield Park [Garfield Park Conservatory, Chicago, Illinois], they made artificial beaches in an area, dug it out, put sand in, and used it in the summertime because there were no--the--there were no other places that they could swim and they had no--I don't know of any of the field houses at that time on the South Side that had a indoor swimming pool.  All of the swimming was done at the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] in the boys club.  There were no--and even, even though they built that Olympic size swimming pool in Washington Park, it was strictly outdoors.  At the end of the summer, it was closed and there was no place to swim except at, as I say, at the boys club.  So, the friction that developed back in those days over, over the facilities was caused by the fact that in the new neighborhoods where we or in the fringe areas of the neighborhood where we moved in, there were no recreational facilities at all.  So, there was a battle back then to get parks--as I say, I opened Ada Park [Chicago, Illinois] when it was brand new.  They just--I was the first instructor there.  We only had the parks that I had named.  Those were the only parks available.  But, to meet the small needs of the community and so far as, the city and the board of education had playgrounds, and all around Chicago, you can go and find these little--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --little--that was the recreational facility--that was the only recreational facility for the people that lived in those neighborhoods.
Story_ID: 614888
Speaker 1: You went from instructor, phys ed [physical education] instructor to park district supervisor.
Speaker 2: Playground supervisor (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Playground supervisor.  And then, where did you--
Speaker 2: Park supervisor.
Speaker 1: Park supervisor--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was next, huh?  Okay.
Speaker 2: And all of these--all of these positions were, were under civil service.  That was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --other thing.  The--
Speaker 1: So you had to take a test for the--
Speaker 2: Had to take a test, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I took a test for my physical instructor's job.  Prior to the taking the test and passing, you were a temporary.  You could be hired--and the tests were giving at--given at various times and they had a large enough need, and you could take the test.  Each position up to area supervisor required you to take a test.  A physical instructor, you took a test for, a playground supervisor, you took a test for, and a park supervisor, you took a test for.  Beyond the park supervisor, it was all an appointed thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I was a playground supervisor and there's a long story there.  I was a temporary park supervisor and that was because when they gave the exam for park supervisor, I took the exam, and then part of the process was a written exam.  Another part of the second part of the process was actual exam where you had to actually go in and do these things and had to--I had to swim, I had to do mat work.  I had to do all these things that I was going to have to teach.  They had a physical--they had an actual exam for that.  So, you took the written and if you passed the written, then you took the practical.  And if you passed the practical, then you became civil service.  And that was--that was the makeup of the system.  Now, they have not given a park supervisor's exam even to the day.  It's discontinued now.  But, I was the last person involved in the park supervisor's exam and I did not pass or take it because I got married [to HistoryMaker Darwin McBeth Walton] and we were on our honeymoon in 1950.  They gave the exam.  I took the written, passed the written, and when I was called for the practical, I was in Mexico on my honeymoon.  And they sent a notice down to the border to stop me and make me come back so that I could take the exam and I missed it.  I went through before the order came, before they got the order down there.  When I came back from Mexico, here was a notice on the board telling me to come, that there was a message for me.  Anyway, that was the last supervisor's exam that they--that they gave.  Anyway, going on, I was a--I was a park supervisor and then I never was given any consideration for moving up to the next level, which would've been an administrative level because the parks [Chicago Park District] were not--were not ready for integration at the administrative level.
Story_ID: 614889
Speaker 1: Fifty-eight [1958], in 1958-(pause) no, it wasn't.  It was after that because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So it had been in the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 1: --I was still a park supervisor when they held the 1959 Pan American Games.  Did you remember--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --the Pan American Games?
Speaker 2: I heard of them, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And I was--I was selected to work the Pan American Games by the--one of the area supervisors.
Speaker 2: Were they held in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's the year they held them in Chicago.  I had charge of--I mean, I was assigned to the--to the (background noise).  There's the phone.  I was assigned for the tennis and the volleyball were my two events that I had to make the arrangements for.  And the Pan American Games was really the first sort of recognition that I received at--that--for other than just being an instructor.  I was selected as one of the people that would be assigned to the games.  So instead of going to the park, I went to the Pan American office, which was downtown and that's where I worked for that period of time that the games were being developed and then they were conducted.  And, as I say, my--one of my jobs was to find a designation, a location for volleyball, which meant that they had to have a gym large enough to accommodate that sport with its spikes, you know, and that--a high ceiling, and the tennis court.  So, I worked those games.
Story_ID: 614890
Speaker 1: Then after that, I was assigned to Medill Park [Addams/Medill Park, Chicago, Illinois], which was a school park and we're getting into another angle I don't wanna start.  But, anyway, I was assigned to Medill and given the responsibility for three locations.  There was the park and then there were two little playgrounds, you know, I told you about these?  These playgrounds eventually were turned over to the park district [Chicago Park District] in 19--that's where I got the 1959.  In 1959, the City of Chicago [Illinois] took over the park district police force, which meant that we no longer had assigned policemen to the park.  And in turn, they gave the park district all of the little city playgrounds, those little one block locations.  So, I was sort of the supervisor for three little playgrounds located on the West Side in the--in the Abbott Homes [Grace Abbott Homes, Chicago, Illinois], Loomis Courts [Chicago, Illinois].  Then, in 19--about 1960 I guess, somewhere along in there, sixty--no, it wasn't--it was later than that, must've been about '64 [1964] I guess, yeah, about--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Yeah, can you sit back?  'Cause you're out of the light.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: You get too far, you're out of the light.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's all.
Speaker 2: In '64 [1964], I--there was a vacancy that occurred in another department in the building and I applied for it.  The recreation department did not want me to go because they said they had plans for me, but for a number of years, I had been told that they had plans for me, but the only plan that ever developed was that wherever they had a difficult situation--
Speaker 1: They send you.
Speaker 2: --why, send Walton [HistoryMaker Claude Walton] over there and, and he'll take care of it.  I mean, I worked with everybody.  I was able to do that, so I could go into these borderline situations where they were having trouble and sort of get the job done, so that became my role.  But it--I still was just a park supervisor.  So, this opportunity opened up as a--as assistant director of employee activities, and I applied for that.  And (laughter) miracle though it was, I got the job.
Story_ID: 614891
Speaker 1: In about 1964, I think, a vacancy became available in the employee activities section, and I applied for it, and received the appointment.  I was the first black administrator in the park district system [Chicago Park District].  Up until that time, there--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --there were none.
Speaker 2: There had been no one else, huh?
Speaker 1: And I served in that capacity until 1970, and in 1970, the commissioners put a new title in the budget for me.  They told me that this was--they were putting it in for me and I was the only person to get the job.  They put in the title of associate superintendent.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I became the associate superintendent, which was the highest position that we had ever held in the park district.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And a superintendent of parks is the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Associate superintendent.
Speaker 2: No, no, I said, the superintendent of parks is the biggest--
Speaker 1: The superintendent--there was--
Speaker 2: --is the--
Speaker 1: --the superintendent--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the assistant superintendent, and the associate superintendent.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you were like third in line, yeah.
Speaker 1: I was third.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: And that's where I finished my career--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --with the park district.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: I put in forty-five years with the park and retired as associate superintendent.  A sideline to that, I--in, in 1978, I was appointed a trustee for the park district pension fund [Park Employees' Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago] and thirty years later, I am still a trustee for our pension fund.  When I came aboard, it was a fund of a--of a hundred and twenty-five million and today, it's a fund of around six hundred million, and they won't let me retire (laughter).  I'm still on the board.  That's my--that's my park district.
Story_ID: 614892
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: No because I have--everything that has happened to me has happened within the conditions of the time.  I have been the person that could adjust to the--whatever the conditions were and go forward.  I was given the job of associate superintendent [of the Chicago Park District] because the superintendent said that--well, the commissioners first said that in their talking around to employees, they couldn't find anybody that didn't like me or respect me.  And the superintendent said that the reason that I was being appointed was that the employees were to listen to me and that was why I got my appointment.  So, you see, I've operated within the system and yet tried to do things that would make it possible for someone to follow me or to go forward or to even, as I say, put a title in the budget for me that wasn't even there.  And there's nothing that I would do different.  I haven't been one of these rabble rousing type of persons that went in and decided that I was going to change.  My--I always felt that my first responsibility was to make sure that whatever I did did not close the door that I had opened, and that has been what has happened.  The old time worn expression, you're different, (laughter) and that's what happened to me.  I worked from--I worked from within the organization with the organization or the powers that be.  So, no, there isn't anything that I would've done differently.  There isn't a--anything that I actually could have done differently.  You see, I had to work within the system as it existed then, which was not quite like it is now.
Story_ID: 614893
Speaker 1: The camera was turned off when you were telling us that you remember when George Dunne [George W. Dunne] was just a park supervisor.
Speaker 2: George Dunne was my park--was my area supervisor and we became very good friends.  As a matter of fact, when I needed a job for my daughter [Claudette Walton Giles], why, no question, I went to George.  He was with the county.  But, yes, I had the respect and I had the opportunity of the--of working with the administration including the commissioners.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can--
Speaker 2: When I received my appointment as--official appointment as park supervisor [for the Chicago Park District], one of the commissioners who, who was Daley's [Richard M. Daley] right hand, McGuane [John F. McGuane], Commissioner McGuane, and they've got a park on the--over in the 11th Ward, McGuane Park [Chicago, Illinois].  McGuane, McGuane gave me my appointment and he said if anybody questions it, you refer them to me, so that was the way it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, they stood by it all the way, yeah.  So, again, if you--when you look at everything that you've accomplished in athletics and in--as a park supervisor and administrator, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I guess only that I was able to win the trust and the respect of the people with whom I worked and they in turn were willing to recommend me for the next level.
Story_ID: 614894
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: My hopes is that we--that we develop a sense of urgency to the point that we--that we are willing to work hard enough to take advantage of the opportunities that are being made available.  My concern is that we are--we don't have that sense of urgency.  We don't have that sense of I've got to be prepared.  I've got to quit saying what hasn't happened to me and say what I'm going to do to make it happen.  We've always said that we weren't given an opportunity.  In the past few years while it has--while it has not been earth shattering, we have been given opportunities and I think that only because that we have not prepared ourselves to take advantage of these opportunities has slowed us down, has prevented us from moving forward any faster, and we're still at that point.  We are not prepared in too many instances to take advantage of the--of the opportunities that are available for us, and that has been my chief concern, that--I guess--I guess, I look at it from the standpoint, we were--we're overwhelmed and greatly impressed by the--by the accomplishments of our race in the athletic field and in the entertaining--entertainment field.  But, the business, financial field, the field--the things that make the world turn, we're greatly lacking.  I would hope--I would've hoped that we would have more individuals going into the business world, into the financial world.  I see these kids out in the--in the street bouncing a ball away like mad.  Every kid you see has got a ball to bounce.  I mean, they're gonna be a Michael Jordan.  But, that isn't what makes the world turn.  What makes the world turn is the guy that's inside maybe sitting behind a desk in the corner or something like that being involved in the--in the--in the programs that make the world continue to revolve.  And I have really not been happy with the direction with which too many of our youth are going into.  And, as I say, it seems to me that they're going into something that--that's easy and that is that I'll learn how to pass--to bounce a ball, but then that's a short lived goal, entertainment.
Speaker 1: Are you any more hopeful now because of the recent election of--
Speaker 2: I think that that will be (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) of Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama]?
Speaker 2: I think that will be a great incentive because we've always said we didn't have an incentive.  And I haven't gone along with that wholeheartedly because where we have had an incentive, why too frequently we have failed because we weren't totally prepared.  And, but I think the greatest thing that has happened is that the election of a president, which is the highest honor that can be achieved (background noise) in this country, I think that will serve as a--as a stimulant, as an example for the youth coming along.  They can--they see that now we can become president.  We used to talk about I want to be president.  We now can be president if we are prepared.
Story_ID: 614895
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your family.  Tell us something about your children [John Walton and Claudette Walton Giles] and your wife [HistoryMaker Darwin McBeth Walton] and--
Speaker 2: Well, I (background noise), I have had--I've had a good family.  I have had a family in which we have had a good, what I consider a good family relationship with no more than the normal amount of disagreements and stumbling blocks.  I have--I've never encountered any, any, any actions on the part of my children that required any other than a reprimand.  They have been good, solid individuals.  I won't say that I'm totally happy with the results in my daughter, but up to a point, they both had in my opinion been successful and they had been--they had been conscientious in their--in their desires to be solid citizens, to be good, dependable human beings.  My wife is--has always been an ambitious, active person, still is.  She has combined many talents to produce the kind of life that has been worthwhile and meaningful to--not only to her but to her family.  I can't say that I would, once again, that I would change a thing.  I think I've been a fortunate individual to be able to say that there really is nothing that I would change in my life if I had to do it over again.
Story_ID: 614896
Speaker 1: Tell me this, is there anything that we have not discussed that you think we need to cover before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so because I have--I think I have had to earn everything that I have received, all my accolades and all my recognition.  I earned that by trying to be a good, conscientious person, by trying to do not only what was required--what was expected and required, but what I thought would make a major contribution.  I've always been mindful of the fact that since I came along when I did, I was--I was exposed to--what I did had a bearing on what someone following me could do.  If I did not do good, then the person coming along after me would be no better off, would not have any easier time.  In other words, I guess I have been the kind of person that felt that I wanted to open the door but I didn't want to just open it, I wanted it to stay closed and that coming along at the time I did, what one person did reflected on what the approach or the attitude would be for the next minority coming along.  I knew that if I failed, then the--anybody coming along immediately after--and that's what I did in the park district [Chicago Park District] and the reason that I think I got ahead, was that I tried to do nothing that would do--that would do other than reflect a positive result.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not perfect, no ways and means, but I tried not to do anything that would be bad enough to influence anyone giving thought to future action they could take and so far as our--as our acceptance was concerned.  They could--I could always be the person they would refer back to as well if you were--if you're like Walton [HistoryMaker Claude Walton].  And I guess the thing that is--that impressed me at my earliest--in my earliest years was that when I went into the high school, West High [West High School, Denver, Colorado] when I did, the principal said to me, "Now, we just had three other individuals.  If you are like them, why you'll be all right."  And that really stuck with me, that that's how he--and that's how I was being--that's the grounds under which I was being accepted and that's what was what was expected of me, that if I were like the three people that had preceded me, why I'd be all right.  So, I have always tried to put myself in the position of saying if you are like Walton, why you'll be all right.

Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't know.  I really hadn't--I really hadn't given that any, any serious thought.  I guess I've--I guess I've never been a person that thought a great deal about fame and that--and that.  I guess I--I guess I would like to think that I helped in a small way to improve the conditions under which the--anyone following would have to live.  I've tried--I've tried never to do anything that would give a person a reason to say, "Well, no, we had a bad experience with Walton [HistoryMaker Claude Walton] and we don't want to take a chance with you."  I guess what I'm saying is that because of the times that--the times that I grew up and developed under, the influence of one person had--I mean, the actions of one person had such a great influence on the general public that I wanted to make sure that that influence would be only positive.
