 Finchum  Gibson  Today is June 11, 2010. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with Oklahoma  State University Library, and we   re doing an oral history project  focused on Extension educators. We   re in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, today  to talk with Dorothy Gibson and have her share some of her experiences  with Extension and 4-H and various other things. So, thank you for  joining us today. Let   s have you start by telling us a little bit about your  childhood, where you were born and that type of thing.  I was born in Fort Smith, Arkansas, right on the county line between  Oklahoma and Arkansas, and I lived there until I finished the sixth  grade. Then I moved across the tracks into Oklahoma, and I finished my  high school there at a little small town called Pocola. So, at one point or  other I was on the wrong side of the tracks  I haven   t decided if it was  the Oklahoma or the Arkansas side. It was quite a difference going from  a large town to a very small town and being the new kid on the block  with kids that had gone to school from first grade up.  And what did your parents do for a living?  My dad was a sheet metal contractor, and my mom was a homemaker.  Do you have siblings?  I have one brother, David.  In high school were you involved with homemakers?  This was a new experience for me when I started late middle school or  junior high, they called it back then. I became involved in 4-H. I was  always the outside person. I helped my dad with the chores and stuff,  and my brother was the inside person with my mom. (Laughs) And so, I  was really thrilled to get in 4-H, but at that time it was a little bit more  5  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  gender-operated. It was expected that you took cooking and sewing and  this type of thing, when actually I wanted to do the livestock area and  that type thing. (Laughter)  Well, did you get to do any of that?  I did do the cooking and the sewing and that type of thing, but as far as  livestock projects, I had to wait until my brother got in 4-H at a younger  age, and I did most of his. (Laughter)  And then you graduated from high school in what year?  In    66.  And then went to     Wilburton, Eastern Oklahoma State College. It was a small college,  definitely agricultural. I couldn   t decide exactly what I wanted to do. I  knew I wanted to be something related to agriculture, home economics,  and I liked to do various things. An office job just didn   t appeal.  And you stayed there?  I stayed there two years. It was a junior college, and from there I went  on to OSU.  To major in home economics?  Home economics, back when it was home economics.  It was that back in the late sixties?  That   s right.  What were some of your favorite courses at OSU?  My favorite courses involved a lot of science. I liked the cooking and the  processes of those. A lot of the science courses I took and clothing  textile design, as well as the child FRCD  Family Relations and Child  Development  area.  Once you got there and into the program, were there very many men?  In those days, it was about three to one men.  I thought it might be.  6  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Yes. In Wilburton, we had a piece of a dorm for girls, and all the rest of  the girls were guys (Laughter), which came in real handy. At that time,  speech was not one of my fortes, and so it was real easy sliding in with  the ag guys who were even more intimidated to be in front of the  classroom than me.  At either one of the colleges, did you get to work with livestock?  When I went to OSU, I got into the collegiate 4-H, and we did some  there. At that time, I would come back during the summer and work with  the Le Flore County 4-H. So, I got to do some there.  Did you do any of the 4-H Roundups?  Some, yes.  Your goal was to become     My goal was originally to get into Extension work. I liked the variety of  Extension. Basically I   m a teacher at heart, and I liked being able to  teach different things. Still, back then you had your nook, and I figured  I   d be real close to the agriculture side anyway. I took a job, and it  would be northeast Arkansas next to the Tennessee line. That did not  develop because I had purchased a fourteen-foot wide mobile home, and  at that point in time you couldn   t take a fourteen on Arkansas highways.  So, I decided,    Well, go the next route.    There were no openings in  Oklahoma for Extension, and so I took a teaching position at Lenapah.  Home economics?  Home economics, right.  Well, let me back up. How had you learned about Extension as a job to  begin with?  Through OSU, and I had some really good 4-H agents, young ladies that  I really admired.  Did you have a role model once you got out of college?  Not particularly.  In home ec, you taught what grades?  High school.  7  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Ninth through twelfth?  Nine through twelve. I did have some eighth grade, very minimal.  Because of my FRCD training in special education, I worked with some  low-IQ, working with living skills and minimal job skills. Like how to  bus tables and this type of thing.  Had your college days prepared you much for that?  Yes, because I was in a pilot program when I did my student teaching in  Sand Springs, and we worked with some challenged students.  At that time in the late sixties, did they have the home management  house or practice house?  Oh, yes. (Laughs) That was quite an eye-opening experience, because I  had grown up in a rather sheltered environment and always was able to  choose my roommates. I think from the horror stories I hear, I got the  best of the deal. I wound up in Brumley Apartments, which was there on  the campus, or the edge of campus at that time, and I was like a duck out  of water. (Laughs) We had to do a party once, and you had to do all  these different things. I was,    Oh, what have I gotten myself into with all  of these strange people in here?    (Laughs) It   s definitely something I  will always remember.  Do you remember who your instructor was or who was overseeing that  part of the department?  No, I don   t. At that time I tried to just block most of that from my  memory. (Laughter) It was just something that we had to get through,  and looking back, when I heard some of the things that the other kids  had to do, that really I probably didn   t have it all that bad.  So, you graduated in 1970?  Seventy, yes.  And then taught school for six years.  I taught school for six years.  And then?  And then I decided that we would try to raise a family. I   d gotten  married during that time, and I wanted to stay home on the farm and  8  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  help my husband, and he had a tax business also. So, I stayed home for  about six years, I guess. Actually, I worked at home. My friend and I  had a craft business, and crafts were real big in the early seventies. We  specialized in sewing-type  crafts , pillows and quilts and baby quilts  and monogramming and that sort of thing, and we could take the kids  with us. Then there became a need in town for a preschool, because  preschool education was coming in, and I   d had many hours along this  line and my friend had an early childhood education degree. So, we  started a preschool for three- and four-year-olds, and we ran it for  fourteen years.  So, still using your college education.  Right, right, just in a different area. I think if you   re a teacher at heart,  you   re going to teach one way or the other. During through all of this I  was teaching piano also. So, I had my hands in it, but when they started  the K-4, pre-k, into the schools, well, then we closed, and that   s when I  went to work for Extension .  And what county was that in?  Nowata County.  Discuss how you came to get that job. Did you have competition or     Probably not. I was hired during a hiring freeze, a budget crunch like  they are now, but Nowata County is rather small. Two-agent-educator  county, and they had been without an educator for more than a year. The  lady I   d had the preschool with, my friend, had gone to the county  commissioners meeting, and she had seen the ag educator there. He was  moaning and groaning that he did not have someone for the FCS   Family and Consumer Sciences  position. At that time, it was only half-time,  and I thought,    Oh, I could swing this and the tax office.    I knew  we were closing the preschool, and so I went in and applied. I went to  OSU and went through the interviews and things. Consequently, I got  the job.  In what year?  It would have been    99 or    98, something like that.  Describe the county a little bit. Was it rural?  Very, very rural. Nowata is the largest town, 3,000 or something. Ten  thousand in the whole county, and the Extension office was located in  the fair building, and the fair building is rather old. The Extension office  9  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  had been in the courthouse, and they moved them out. It was just a little  boxed-in area of the barn. (Laughs)  Air conditioned?  It had a little wall unit, and the heater was this big monstrous thing that  when it came on everybody had to be quiet, and had an extension cord  that came through from the outside plug-in. My computer and  everything in the office   I think there was two outlets in the office.  Everything else had an orange cord over to your particular little area in  that one room. It was just divided off with the file cabinets, and as the  technology era came, it became harder and harder to power up. They  now have a new building on the side of the fair building, so they   re  doing much better.  Did you have an assistant?  I did. We had a secretary for the both of us, and I was very fortunate. We  had what was called Green Thumb or Experience Works, one of those  programs, and there was a lady there that had been there a couple of  years before I came and joined. She pretty well helped guide me through  the HCE  Home and Community Education  and helped out where I  needed with the hands-on stuff, the busy stuff, getting ready for projects  and stuff. She was a real help because the secretary had all the day-to-day  stuff that she had to take care of, so I was very fortunate.  Did you work with adults and youth?  Yes, I did.  Did you do any special programming for the elderly?  Yes, that was one of my areas, and I chose food and nutrition mainly  because that was the area I was experienced in the most, I felt like, and  quickest to come up to speed on the new technologies and requirements.  I knew I wanted to reach the largest majority in the quickest way, and so  I partnered with the senior citizen   s center. I presented programs  monthly on any type of nutrition, health, wellness, and safety at the  senior citizen center. So, I had a captive audience, which helped the  numbers, and I got to develop a personal relationship with them. They  were more open with me because I was a local person, whereas a lot of  times it is rather hard to get them to discuss nutritional needs and that  sort of thing. And so, it worked out really well.  And what are some activities you did with the youth?  10  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Everything 4-H: carwashes, sewing workshops, food workshops. We  partnered with Farm Bureau to do fire safety projects, and I worked with  them very intensely. Of course, any time there is a vacancy, you lose the  kids very quickly, and 4-H had gone downhill, as well as our county fair  participation. There was nothing there. Someone came into the office  those first few days and made mention that years ago they used to  feature the kids in newspapers. So, I talked with the newspaper, and I  said,    Well, now, if I get the pictures and the articles, could you publish  them?    They were very open to that, and at that time, Nowata had two  newspapers to cover the county. I spent my first summer at just about  every 4-H-ers house traipsing through barn lots, taking pictures of all  their projects and their chickens and their goats and their cattle, and I  would write articles in the paper then about that project, how to make  entries.  At the same time, I visited different adults, and we talked about their  canning projects or quilt projects, and then I would give guidelines in the  paper on    if you would like to enter a quilt project    and this type thing.  So, I was fortunate to see the fair really grow, and the kids. The Clover  Buds came into being about that time, and that is the pre-4-H, and from  my preschool years, I had a lot of contact with those pre-4-H-ers. So, we  got some others involved and got a lot of Clover Buds involved, and did  a lot of day camp type things. They could enter those things in the fair,  too, so it worked out very well.  Do you remember about how many children there might have been at  any time?  Probably between two and three hundred, probably.  That   s quite a few to keep up with.  Yes, and a lot of them were just enrolled basically for the livestock  projects. But the ag guy got the poultry judging taken care of, and I was  very familiar with the livestock judging because my son was a livestock  judger. So, we got these kids going and kind of teamed with ag guys. We  didn   t have the resources for a lot of the judging teams, but they would  be enrolled in 4-H, and basically they   d tag along with the ag guys. So,  the ag guys would kind of be their leader, project leader, and that sort of  thing.  From the county fair, then, did many of them go on to the state fair?  Yes, we had several go on to the state fair. Then I would pull out the  camera, and drive to the state fair, and go to the pig shows and the calf  shows. Then their projects that we took to be entered, their arts and  11  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  crafts things, we   d take all the pictures and bring them back and publish  those. Nowata has a lot of empty buildings in town, and I would ask  them if we could display in their windows. The kids really enjoyed  having their  work on display . They could drag Mom downtown or  Grandma downtown that didn   t get to see them at the fair with their  ribbons and stuff.  And did you do demonstrations, as well?  Yes, I did a lot of demonstration work, and I did a lot of what I called  Lunch and Learns, demos at noontime at the bank. They had a  conference room and allowed us to have different kinds of gift jars and  low-fat cooking and things that I could do. People would bring their  lunch, and I had a really good turnout for that.  Once a week or once a month?  It wasn   t an ongoing thing. I tried to always do one around Christmas,  probably about three a year, and run them for two or three weeks at a  time.  Were there very many homemaker clubs at that time?  They were really, really down. I think I had four clubs from the  previous   they had ten or twelve, I guess, but things were going down,  and the dues were going up, so several of them had dropped out.  Actually, some of them still meet, but it   s on an unofficial basis. They   re  not part of the HCE program.  I asked that because usually when you retire they make a quilt for you.  No, we didn   t really have any quilts in those. I got birdbath and  gardening things, because they knew I was really into yard stuff.  (Laughs)  Did you have a part of the job that you liked the best?  I really enjoyed working with my ladies and giving the programs.  When you gave the programs, did they help choose topics or did you  choose them?  I always gave them evaluation sheets, but since I did them mostly in the  food area they didn   t care as long as there was a program. (Laughter)  Did you have any monthly reports?  12  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Oh, yes. I came, of course, that was the time of the hiring freeze, and I  think I probably was one of the very last  hired  when everything was  done hardcopy. You know, you write out your reports and you mail  them in. I had maybe a few months like that, and they were already  transferring over to the computer. Of course, I had not spent years doing  it the paper method, and so, I didn   t have much trouble switching over,  but a lot of them that had been there for years and years, especially the  ag guys, that was a very challenging     Big transition, yes.  Very transitional, and it was just really traumatic for them. (Laughs)  The person that had been in that position before you, were they still in  the county?  No, no. They moved. I   m not even sure where they moved. Marilee  Nunnallee had been for several years, and then she retired, and then they  had a series of short timers. Very short timers. A few months at a time.  Then it had been a little over a year that they hadn   t had any.  They had to play catch up a little bit. You were part-time to begin with.  I was part-time, and Dr.  Lynda  Harriman interviewed me. She said,     Now, you know it might come into full time.     I did not think this was  likely, and neither did she   I was hired on. I went to work on February  first, and the spring livestock show was the twenty-third, and so I had to  jump right in with the 4-H and the kitchen for the HCE, and July first I  went full time.  So, pretty quickly.  Very quickly, yes, before I really hardly got the ins and outs and all the  abbreviations down pat. (Laughs)  Did you start going to conferences and such?  Well, I had to go to conferences and things right off the bat. I think I got  to wait until after I was full time before they did the new educators that  went on campus, and we spent about three days at three different times,  because due to the hiring freeze there were none. I think we had eight or  ten, and people had been working a year or so that they finally got  enough together to do that.  Tried to get you all on the same page.  13  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Right, getting us all on the same page.  Distance-wise on your county, about how big?  To the county line one way it   s probably ten or twelve miles, and from  Nowata it   s twenty miles the other way to the north. We   re about fifteen  to eighteen miles to the county line, Washington County-wise, and Craig  County, we   re probably about fifteen. So, Nowata is pretty central for it.  I was just curious if you could go to several places in one day?  I would go up north to South Town,  as the locals call it,  and Oklahoma  Union,  formerly Lenapah . I could do it in one day, and that is the bulk  because Alluwe schools had consolidated. I did a senior citizen   s   center  there, but it basically had to be a special trip.  It put quite a few miles on your car, anyway.  Very, very, very. (Laughs) A different vehicle is usually mandatory  pretty often, and one that will hold a lot of people.  Well, describe a typical day.  I started at seven thirty in the morning. The office opened at eight, but I  liked to get there first so I can get my desk organized and have a little bit  of quiet time to breathe and check my calendar. You usually spent the  morning, once I got a computer and we had internet, doing the internet  and that sort of thing. After, the secretary went to the mail about nine  thirty or so, and I found if there was any kind of paperwork that had to  be done, and any type of office work that had to be done. Usually, the  programming was in the afternoon. My senior citizens were at eleven.  The programs I did at school. I did Character Critters with the pre-Ks  with some of my HCE ladies, and then I also did a sign vandalism  program. We had a real bad problem with vandalized road signs, and the  commissioners, one of them, had asked me,    Can you do any kind of  program?    So, I spent several months finding information and videos  and things. I went to all the schools, and I did that with the high-school-and  middle-school-age kids, and did most of that in the afternoons.  Could you tell if it helped?  It did. At the time I was doing the program, it dropped dramatically, but  the program stops and the kids just go right back to it.  Would you have to do evening hours, like after you got off at five?  14  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Quite often, yes. Quite often, you had your booster club meetings, your  different club meetings that you went to, a lot of Saturday work. We  instigated and started up  a 4-H dog project club . I had a lady in town  that did a lot of dog training, and so she was very helpful. She taught it  for free, and we started up a dog club. One of my 4-H mothers was kind  of in charge of that, so they met in the evening and then it was weekend  dog shows. If you averaged it all in, it would probably average maybe  two Saturdays a month. Some months you   d maybe get by with one, but  you   d sure hit three the next. Probably the first of the month you might  hit, it probably averaged at least one night a month. Two, three,  according to what   some weeks I would have every night.  Not a forty hour a week job?  Definitely not a forty  hour a week job . When fairs and livestock shows  hit, it was from six that morning until midnight.  Was there compensation?  No. (Laughs) No. Matter of fact, you had to get there earlier on Monday  morning because the office had been so tracked up with people running  in and out, you couldn   t work there until you ran the sweeper and  cleaned out of all of the barnyard stuff. (Laughs) So, it had long hours. I  don   t think anybody would survive if they thought it was a nine to five.  If you   re having to tramp through the barnyard so much, you   d have to  be careful what you chose to wear that day.  Yes, you did. You definitely came in jeans and your cruddy shoes.  (Laughter) Definitely.  Hadn   t asked anyone that, but it makes sense.  It does. In a small place like us, especially if your office is a corner of  the barn and the way they set up, well, you had to go through all of the  pig and the sheep pens in order to get back to that little corner of the  office where the office door was. They would set up their computer  there, and of course it was in and out and in and out.  Especially during fair time.  Yes, yes. Yes, it was very long.  What did you like the least, then, since we covered the best?  15  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  I think what I liked the least was probably the having to go to the Capitol  and beg for money (Laughs) and that type of stuff, and the paperwork. I  didn   t mind it if it pertained to my class, but just the necessary  paperwork and stuff, the legalities you had to do, I did not care for that.  I   d rather be working and be giving my programming that I had.  Well, in a small county like that, your county director was probably the  ag agent.  Right.  And so, he would have done the budget?  Right. He was ill one year, and I had to help with it quite a bit.  And that   s a whole different ballgame, isn   t it?  Whole different ballgame, and that   s why when CED  County Extension  Director  was offered to me,    No, thank you. (Laughter) Am not  interested in that.     Well, let   s say on tape what HCE stands for.  Home and Community Education. And it was the old Extension  Homemakers, and its name has changed over the years several different  times, but it   s what many, many years ago was called the Extension  Clubs.  On these weeks that you were putting in quite a bit of overtime, your  husband picked up the slack at home?  Yes, he did. He was very good. He learned how to run the dishwasher  and make tea, and when I   d had a very traumatic day, he would,    Well,  do we need to go back to town for dinner tonight?    (Laughs) So, he was  very flexible and very helpful.  And you had a farm?  Yes, he raised cattle.  And you had your own garden?  Yes, yes.  And do you still can?  16  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  No. (Laughs)  Or freeze?  Yes, I freeze some, but we have raised beds, and with just the two of us,  it was more economical to just buy frozen food.  Not even homegrown tomatoes?  Oh, now, we have those, but we eat until they   re gone. But we don   t put  them in the freezer or can them.  And do you still sew some?  Yes. It took me several years after thousands and thousands of pillows in  the craft years. I like to appliqu   and that sort of thing, crafty sewing.  And do you turn something in to the county fair?  Yes. When I retired I joined one of the groups that I had started, people  about my own age, and we call it the Extension /therapy group (Laughs)  because we   re all about the same age and the same crises in life. So, it  works real good.  When did you retire?  I retired in end of 2003.  And have been doing     Well, I would have loved to have stayed longer, but my mom was  diagnosed with Alzheimer   s, and my dad was in very poor health, and  when you make these programs in Extension, there isn   t a substitute  teacher you can call. I knew I was having to make a lot of trips to Fort  Smith, and when I did my programs and stuff, I wanted to do them  correctly, and I didn   t want to leave people hanging. So, it was just a  decision that I decided probably was for the best of everything. I didn   t  want to half-do my job.  Did they replace you?  That was another period of transition. I came in on a hiring freeze, and I  left when the budget was hitting the bottom, and so they just kind of  shuffled people. Since I left, most of them have been a couple of years,  some a few months.  17  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Is the 4-H group still going?  Yes, it has grown in different ways, and like I said earlier, I was kind of  the end of the old-school. The technology age has hit. The way they do  things have all changed. Even the project areas for 4-H has all changed,  and where I had still yet a lot of country kids, a lot of them are made up  of the urban kids now. And so, it   s kind of a whole different ballgame.  Then, that same transition time before computers were really into it, how  did you do your research when you were preparing for a new topic?  OSU sent a lot. We could get it from OSU. They did a lot more research  for us and had a lot of the learning packets. The fact sheets and things  were all in this little book, and you could call OSU,    Send me down...    I  did a lot of it that way. I was probably in Extension a couple of years  before we got internet to all of our computers. The secretary had  internet. She did the ag guy   s e-mail and checked his mail, and, of  course, he was the one that didn   t know how to use the computer. And  we finally, through Extension, got enough funding that we all were able  to get the internet. Then, once it was online, then it just skyrocketed  because the specialists started putting their things online. When I left it  was just getting to the point where if you needed to do a demo, well, you  could click on Dr.  Janice  Hermann   s or Dr.  Barbara  Brown   s and you  could pull out the information, making it much easier.  Would you have to print things off and mail them to people, too?  Yes. We   d have to print it and mail it, and they don   t do as much of that  anymore. It   s pretty much a lot of e-mail. They don   t hand out the fact  sheets. We had rows of file cabinets that you   d go through and dig to  find tomato stuff on. Now you give them a website and, you know, if  they don   t have any  internet  access you can print it off for them or  something. You   d just go to the computer and pull it up and print it off.  I wonder what happened to all of those file cabinets.  Well, in Nowata   s case, they  the fair board  left them all over there  in  the barn  when they got a grant, and built a new little office beside the  fair building. So, the old office was still left in their kind of storage area,  and all of the files had the old-time fluorescent bar lights, and they  shorted out and they had a little fire in there. I think that took care of all  of the historical data that was there. (Laughs) So, I don   t think they have  too much of the old stuff.  Did they keep the old copies of the old narrative reports?  18  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Well, there were old, like, kind of looked like army-issue file cabinets in  the back of the barn, and if you cared to dig through the mice and  whatever, they   re probably buried in there.  And they probably sent copies on and kept a copy there?  Right, and I think the boxes in my garage are probably some of the old  paper.  It   d be interesting to see how far back they went.  I know it fell to my duty one time to help clean out some of that stuff,  and they went back years, fifties and sixties, and, you know, the old  paper files.  But had there been photographs of the demonstrations?  When I came, there was an old box of just photos. You had no clue what  these photos went to. Some of them were just different things associated  with the Extension office, and I was able to pass on some to the library  because the Extension  Homemakers Clubs  were responsible for  helping to set up the first library in Nowata County. And had some of  those pictures in there of kids who were bringing their kids, they were in  this box, and I hated to see this box lost. It was looking worse and  worse, and the pictures were deteriorating. So, any time I had a meeting,  I had the box, (Laughs) and we   d try to get people to look through and  see if they recognize themselves from the past. We did some bulletin  boards, story boards, that I put in the windows downtown:    4-H Past and  Present    and    County Past and Present.    We used a lot of them like that,  and I   m glad now that we got them passed out, since they probably  would have been in the fire.  What did you do with all of the ones you took?  I left them in the office when I left, and there was a bunch of them. I  made for myself kind of a notebook of all the 4-H ones that I had taken,  and we used them. I thought,    Well, I   m getting a lot of these pictures,     and so for 4-H banquet, we always tried to make some type of table  decorations that we could incorporate the pictures. Then the kids got to  take theirs. If it was in March we might do clovers and have their  pictures and such and used them in slideshows and things like that.  And be creative as well as organized.  That   s right, but they seemed to enjoy it, and following themselves.    Oh,  I   m on this picture        I   m on that picture     It worked out real good.  19  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Between teaching home ec and working Extension, did you like one  better than the other?  I liked Extension better, and I always kind of figured I would because  teaching is restrictive. You   re in that classroom, and that   s where you   re  at. I could reach all age areas  in Extension , and I really enjoyed  working with all kinds of clients. My very first job, I think it was the  first few days I was on. Back then I was part-time, and I raced from the  tax office. The lady that worked at the sheriff   s office was there, and she  said,    I need you to do a program.       Okay.    And so, my very first  program in Extension was to the inmates on cooking their meals. So, she  took me up in their conference room, and they had a guard over to the  side, (Laughs) and we talked about different ways to cook with their  food that they got, how they could make healthy meals.  Wasn   t prepared for that type?  I was not quite prepared for that, no, but OSU came through. They had  some nutritional things that I could use. That one went well. A couple of  years later, I came over to Washington County and helped the new  educator here go down to the jail and talk to the ones that were in charge  of the foods there.  Well, they found you.  They found me. (Laughs)  You know, you always wonder how they make the connection. I mean,  are you out marketing yourself, or because someone did it before you,  they know to ask?  I don   t know how many had done that before me, but I think in that  instance it helped being a local person. I had been there since    70 in that  town. They all knew me, and if I had not taught their child in high  school, I had taught them in preschool, or they had bought crafts from  me, or we saw them at the tax office. (Laughs) So, I had a really base  clientele that as soon as they heard that I was at the Extension office,  when it came out in the paper, well, they knew where to find me.  The phone was ringing.  That   s right. That   s right.  Did they call you at home much with questions?  20  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Occasionally they would call, and,    We rented the fair building and we  can   t get it open. Can you come open it for us?    So, you never knew  what was going to come up.  Questions on how to get stains out or how to     Everything from,    Somebody gave me blueberries. Do I peel them?     (Laughs)    I   ve got a tub of green beans, and my pressure cooker quit.     And,    Is it okay to still water bath those?       No. I don   t think we  recommend that anymore. OSU does not recommend that.    (Laughter)  Just,    There   s a skunk under my house. How do I get rid of the smell?     You never knew what was going to come up.  If you couldn   t answer them off the top of your head, did you have  something handy?  There was a lot of hard data, and usually somebody had had that  problem before. Linda Murray was my district person, and, believe it or  not, here she came with the    clean the skunk smell    thing that she had  found somewhere. So, there was a whole lot more of that during this  time period than probably now because you just click on the internet. It  was shortly after the big tornadoes in Oklahoma City, and they did a lot  of hard copies on how to clean up after storms and stuff. So, we had a lot  of that sort of thing that was available. We didn   t know we were in the  Dark Age (Laughs) because we hadn   t experienced the electronic age  yet.  Well, I guess you   d have almost a who-to-call file with the questions  asked most often.  Yes, actually had notebooks and stuff. It didn   t take you long to get a list  of specialists, and usually if it was a question that was totally   I wasn   t  right out of school (I   d had a lot of life experience, too). So, if they  called,    I just ruined some wheat-colored jeans,    I could draw on my  own experiences on how to do deal with a problem. But you kept  specialists    numbers, and usually I just said,    Well, I can   t get my hands  on that information right now. Give me your number and I will talk to a  specialist, and I will get back with you.    And so, that   s usually how you  handled one that was not in your realm or you didn   t have the book right  there.  Extension was nice that you could go on up the line.  Right, you had a back-up force all the way up the line, and you could get  them on the phone most of the time. If you didn't have one, you had  another one.  21  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Had the other ones had vandalism with signs before?  No one had. I had to pretty much dig that stuff up myself. I got internet  at home so that I could do some of the research, and I went through  ODOT,  Oklahoma Department of Transportation  and they put me in  touch with different states that were doing programming on it. I would  contact the ODOT in that state, and so it was a slow process. It probably  took me six or eight months to gather.  Did someone come along after you and ask to borrow your work?  I don   t know. We used it in several different instances and with a  middle-school-type programming they did with all the schools, and there  were some ODOT speakers that came. But some of the information that  I used was out of Florida, and it was pretty straightforward, and some of  it from ODOT   s pretty straightforward.    These are the consequences of  your actions.    So, some of the higher-ups decided,    Well, maybe that   s  being a little bit too graphic.    It worked at the time, but they haven   t  used it since. I made connections with one in Tulsa who gave me other  addresses. It   s just links, which now you do on the computer.  Yes. So, as we   re wrapping things up, is there something I haven   t asked  that you would like to share?  I don   t know. I think you   ve covered it.  Well, do you want to close on a highlight, then, something that was  special?  I think it was the people, and it is just a feeling of,    Gee, I helped that  person.    When you see some little old person go out, and they   ve got a  smile on their face. It   s senior citizens, and I think my fondest memory  was the first day I was up there. A little lady (she   s in a nursing home  now) came in with some of the Extension ladies, and I don   t even know  what her question was now. We had an old screen door at the door of the  office. She opens it, and she goes to leave. She turns around and she  says,    I think you   ll do.    (Laughs) She just made me feel really, really  good, and I thought,    You know, if you can help them answer one  question and make them feel at home in that environment, you feel like  you   ve done something.     I   m glad you finally got to do  what you had wanted to .  I did. You know, I had always wanted to, and I thought,    Well, this is  what I was meant to do: to teach.    But in this capacity you could reach a  22  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  Finchum  Gibson  wide variety of people. I can still, now that I   m part-time. I do work in  the library, at the Nowata City County Library, and I still have many of  them hunt me up.  (Laughs) I should have asked that. I bet you do.  Yes, they will still,    The people that are in there don   t know how to  cook. I need to know.    Some of the ones still come and hunt me up, and  I   ve been able to route some of them to the horticulturists at OSU and  different ones, you know. I   ll just point them to which specialist to go  talk to. They come in with questions there at the library, and I say,     Well, you know, if you   re trying to build a chicken house, we may have  one book, but I think if you go out to the Extension office, they might  have several things that will be what you need.    That   s why I   ve been  able to kind of route them back.  Still educating.  Yes, still educating.  Well, thank you for sharing your story today. It   s been great.  It   s been a pleasure. I   ve really enjoyed it.  -------  -------
