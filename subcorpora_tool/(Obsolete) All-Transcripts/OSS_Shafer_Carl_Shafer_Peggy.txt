 Neurohr  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  Neurohr  C. Shafer  My name is Karen Neurohr. I   m a librarian for Oklahoma State  University. Today is Saturday, October 21, 2006. I   m at the  ConocoPhillips Alumni Center with Peggy Shafer, who graduated from  OSU in 1956, and Carl Shafer, who graduated from OSU in 1955, and  they are here to share their stories about their time as students at  Oklahoma State University for the library project O-STATE Stories, an  oral history project of the OSU Library. Since it   s Homecoming this  weekend, let   s start there. What were Homecoming events like when you  were students here?  Much less than they are now. I can remember seeing a parade. I don   t  remember all the house decorations and the Walk Around. You  turning  to his wife, Peggy  lived there in Stout so tell them what it was like     Well, we had a simple house decoration at Stout. I remember it was  something about Charlie Brown. It was just a cut-out. I did participate in  one Homecoming parade when I was the Homecoming Queen, and it  was very simple. It was, you know   we were in a car and there were a  few floats but it was nice. It was just not as big as it is now.  Wasn   t nearly as elaborate.  No, not as elaborate. That   s a good word.  We were just talking about Homecoming and what it was like when you  were students here and Carl, you mentioned something about Peggy and  a special Homecoming activity.  Yes, she was the O-Club Queen, which means she was the Homecoming  Queen, in 1955. This was when she was still going with a football  player (Laughter)   before I managed to enter the scene, so I remember  that. Yes, I saw that parade.  5  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  Neurohr  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  Neurohr  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  Neurohr  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  Did you see that parade?  Yeah. Sure I did.  I didn   t see you out there.  But you   re talking to people who   this is fifty years ago and you   re  asking us what things were like and memory kind of fades a little bit, at  least (Laughs) for me.  So, when you were Homecoming Queen, what did that involve for you?  Well, it involved, like I say, riding in an open-air convertible in the  parade and then at the halftime the president of the O-Club, who was  Ned Blass     That   s right, yeah.     we decided this morning   the wrestler, he crowned me and that was  about it, you know. I was there for the big deal.  How were you selected to be Homecoming Queen?  The living quarters, Stout Hall was where I was living at the time   they  nominated us. Then we appeared before the O-Club, the group who was  nominated, and they chose who would be queen.  So sororities and stuff?  Oh, it was the whole campus. There must have been about twenty-five  or thirty of us.  Did the campus residential life do anything special for Homecoming?  What was that like living in a dormitory and what you did for  Homecoming?  I lived under the north stadium. I didn   t live in Bennett Hall. We ate  over there, but I didn   t live there. There were about seven basketball  players that lived under the north stadium, so we didn   t do anything.  (Laughs)  You didn   t decorate     We didn   t decorate the north stadium, no. We ran the laundry   but  Bennett didn   t do anything as I recall. It was a much more subdued  situation than now, at least for us.  6  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  Neurohr  C. Shafer  Neurohr  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  Neurohr  P. Shafer  Well, I said earlier that Stout Hall had a house decoration, but it was  rather simple. It was about Charlie Brown   Peanuts that had just  become popular and Charlie Schultz. So I remember we did have a  clever house decoration, but it didn   t take a lot of time to make it. It was  fairly simple.  We saw AGR  Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity  last year. We were blown  away by what they do   that   s just amazing  Does anybody go to school  in the fall (Laughter) or do they just decorate houses? (Laughter)  The freshmen are required to go to class and they actually have study  time every week that they   re required to do in the Greek system. Mr.  Shafer, you were in sports here?  In basketball, yeah.  And who was your coach?  Henry P. Iba   Mr. Iba, I should say. I came over here when I was just  out of high school   probably would have gone to Northwestern State  University in Alva, but I came over here with some guys and we tried  out. There were probably a hundred of us in Gallagher Hall for two days,  trying out. I just came over on a, you know, chance of the draw, and he  picked five of us. And I remember talking to him the end of the last day  and he sat there and had this tremendous diamond ring. I remember that,  and he said,    Boy, you come here and I   ll give you a job.    He never  mentioned scholarship. He never said that. He said,    I   ll give you a  job,    which it was, because we worked fifteen hours a week off-season,  cleaned the stadium, ran the laundry, aerated the football field and then  got fifteen dollars a month from Whitehurst Hall. That was big money  because the Leachman  referring to the movie theater     it was only  forty-five, fifty cents to go to the movie when there was a Leachman.  (Laughter)  And you got free room and board and books     Well free room, board, books, tuition, everything   free ride, yeah. You  just had to work out four hours a day during Thanksgiving, Christmas,  New Years (Laughs). But it was good. It was a good, good thing.  And what activities were you involved in, Peggy?  Well, I lived in Stout Hall and I chose not to pledge a sorority. I had a lot  of good friends in a lot of different sororities so I stayed an independent.  And I first became involved in the Baptist Student Union before I came  to Oklahoma A M, and so that was really my group, the BSU. And I  7  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  Neurohr  P. Shafer  Neurohr  P. Shafer  Neurohr  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  ran for freshman secretary and won, and then I ran for   was that  freshman secretary slogan      The best I sees it was Peggy Keas.     I thought it was, because that   s the first time I saw your picture     And so I sort of got involved in politics at that point and kept on. I was a  home economics student senator and involved with Orange and Black  Quill. I   m trying to think   then I was Mortar Board, cap for Mortar  Board. Oh, I was president of Association of Women Students, which  was a really interesting and stretchy experience.  You headed up REW  Religious Emphasis Week .  Religious Emphasis Week. I was co-chairman     Which was a big deal then. It really was. I don   t know if they   ve even  got it now.     with that. I was social director for BSU, which was huge then. Every  Saturday night you had a huge party with all kinds of things going on.  But it was busy and fun.  You mentioned you were president of the Association of Women  Students?  Yes.  Well, I   m not familiar with that organization. I haven   t heard anyone  else talk about that today. I   d like to know a little more about that.  Well, it was probably at a time when women   s activities and men   s  activities were separated. It   d be similar to Blue Key with the men. We  had   Association of Women Students and was involved with  Panhellenic, with independent women activities. I worked closely with  Dean Patchin who was the Dean of Women at that time, and it was an  organization that, in fact, was an outreach to the women   s groups on  campus   sort of a coordinating group.  Well, I   d like to know how you two met.  You tell her  Peggy asks of Carl .  Well, I saw this girl   s picture in the   well I met her at the BSU. I had  met her, but I also saw her picture when she was running in Bennett  Hall, with her propaganda. At that time though, she was going with a  football player, as I recall. But we did meet at the BSU. I called her, and  8  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  Neurohr  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  Neurohr  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  you can tell the rest of that story.  Oh, that   s a good story I think. I did meet Carl at the BSU and, at that  time, the BSU was over here on Knoblock, a little old house     Yes, it hadn   t moved yet.  It had     Where University Baptist Church is.  It had ping-pong tables upstairs. I had just come on campus from this  little town, Harrah, Oklahoma   and walked up the stairs to see these  two tall guys playing ping-pong and they stopped and introduced  themselves to me and the other girl that was with me, and I said,    Hello,  hello,    and then later on that evening this guy called me on the phone  and said,    Would you like to walk to church with me on Sunday?    And I  said,    Well, that would be good.    But he said,    This is Carl Shafer,    and  so when I went down to see him when he came by to pick me up, I  wasn   t sure whether he was CJ who I had met   C. J. Hickson   or Carl  Shafer, so that was     Made a real good impression. (Laughter)  Anyway, we were really good friends for several years before we fell in  love, which was really nice.  And where were you married?  Oklahoma City. First Baptist Church Chapel. What was the name of that  chapel?  Louise Pritchard Chapel.  Kermit Whittaker, who was the Baptist student minister, married us in  1956 when she graduated, June 24th.  What campus traditions were pretty visible, really stood out when you  were a student here?  Well, I remember we only could go to half the basketball games, and I  remember OAMC and,    Ride, Ride, Ride    em Cowboys.    I remember  the wrestling team was big and had great tradition around basketball and  wrestling. Traditions   help me out  asking Carl      The Howdy Walk.  9  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C.

There was a Howdy Walk right through Theta Pond, and you were  always supposed to say,    Howdy,    when you walked down that walk. I  remember that. Other than that, it seems to me   I don   t think we had to  wear beanies. I was asking somebody the other day. I don   t think we did.  I didn   t wear a beanie.  There was no initiation stuff going on, as I recall, at that time. I don   t  recall a lot of traditions other than the songs. I couldn   t tell you a yell  that we had necessarily.  Okay, the Howdy Walk   was that referring to a particular section of the  sidewalk or     Yeah   no right through        was it a particular time that that occurred?  Right through Theta, the Theta Pond area. That was the Howdy Walk.  Anytime you were on campus     You were supposed to say,    Howdy,         at least say it when you were on  that walk.  Oh, okay.  I think that   s faded. (Laughs)  It was a good thing.  Yeah.  So, was it a friendly campus overall?  Oh, yes.  Yes, very friendly.  Yes.  About nine thousand people. I know when we went to Texas A M in     62, there were more people here than there were at Texas A M. That  was about seventy-five hundred down there, but   yeah, this was a  10  Neurohr  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  Neurohr  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  friendly place. A lot of country kids came to Stillwater. There were no  tests to get in, I remember that. No essay   no GRE, no nothing.  (Laughs) You just came and got in. If you passed high school, I guess  you were admitted   for which I am thankful that (Laughs) there was no  extreme     What were some of the places that the students hung out at, congregated  at   gathering places on campus?  On campus.  Well, my fraternity     And off campus, too.  BSU was our big thing. Once we got started   I got roped into that by  my roommates, Hickson and Chester. But the Student Union had just  opened. The library opened in    53, which was my second year here, your  first I guess. Not that I hung out in the library a lot but    (Laughter)  You did, too. I   ll tell you a story.  Yeah, the Student Union was a big gathering place. A lot of people  played cards there. There were always some of my fraternity brothers,  who should have been in class, playing cards there at the Student Union.  I didn   t spend a lot of time there because between basketball and classes  and the BSU, I didn   t do much else.  We had a big Howdy Dance every year     That   s right, yeah.  At the student center. It   s hard for me to say student center because at  Texas A M where we   ve been for forty years it   s the Memorial Student  Center, MSC, so at the student center we had a big Howdy Dance.  Student Union. It   s the Student Union.  It   s the Student Union, isn   t it? It   s not the student center. I want to tell  you one of the things that I thought was funny. At BSU one night, Carl  had a reputation for being a hard worker like Mr. Iba wanted them to be,  and he studied hard. He really did.  Very little skill, but hard working.  He played hard and he studied. I mean, he played basketball hard. One  11  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  night, Kermit Whitaker, our student director, said,    Mr. Iba told me  today he was really worried about the grade point of the basketball team.  Shafer made a 3.8 this semester instead of a 4.0.     That was the best I ever had.  No, it wasn   t. But anyway, he was quoted that way. What else did we     we went to Thompson   s Barbeque in Perry.  Perry, yeah. That   s right. Leachman Theater.  The Leachman?  What were we talking about, traditions     Where we hung out at.  Hung out at, oh   the Leachman Theater was the only movie I knew     but somebody said there was an Aggie Theater down there somewhere,  but I don   t know where that was.  That may have been after us.  It was a drive-in.  Drive-in.  Drive-in movie. There wasn   t a lot of entertainment around.  Most of us, at least females, didn   t have cars on campus then. Carl had a  car, but I didn   t ever have a car. So you stayed on campus, you know.  Down the way, there was a little hamburger joint that I can   t remember,  a drive-in     Yeah, down the   what is this now  asking Peggy ?  Down Washington.  Washington Street, I believe, yeah.  That   s where we went to have Cokes and hamburgers and of course  there was no drinking. I mean, there was maybe some, but 3.2 beer I  think was what we had in that time so     If you had enough money, you could go eat at the Student Union Hotel.  That was a nice place to go, but we didn   t go there very often. But we  12  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  Neurohr  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  didn   t eat out much. Mostly just stayed at the dorm, I think. There was a  Dairy Queen around here someplace. There   s some kind of a dairy     But you knew about that.  Yeah, we did a lot of business there. There was a Louie   s Club joint out  here or something, but we never went out there so    (Laughter)  That was        or was that Oklahoma City?  That was in Oklahoma City. (Laughter)  There was a Louie   s Club in Stillwater. Is it still here? It was a dive out  on, I think somewhere in     Where did you guys go when school was out here and you went there for  Thanksgiving Dinner with the basketball team  Peggy asks of Carl ? It  was a     The Townhouse. There is no Townhouse now. Gene Smelser, the  assistant coach, owned the Townhouse, and that   s where we ate during  Christmas and Thanksgiving and whenever the dorm wasn   t open. It was  a very nice restaurant for that day and age, yeah.  Did you get new uniforms, new shoes for basketball every year?  Oh yeah, we always got new shoes. I don   t think the uniforms changed  much. We had, let   s see, black on the road and white at home, yeah     satiny, they were satin kind of stuff. We always got new shoes   but it  was primitive compared to what athletes get today. Let me tell you. I  look at the facilities that they have at A M  referring to Texas A M      And the shorts were real, real short.  Yeah, short pants. And there was not   in Gallagher Hall   we were over  there the other day for the basketball bash and when I was playing there,  there was nothing. There was no advertisement, no painting, no nothing.  Nothing was painted. They simply had lines on the floor. There may  have been a small A and M out in the jump circle. There was a clock, an  Elgin, E-L-G-I-N, Elgin clock up on the wall. That was it. There was  nothing else. It was very stark   it was very stark and     There was no orange either. (Laughs)  13  C. Shafer  Neurohr  C. Shafer  Neurohr  C. Shafer  Neurohr  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer     simplicity. No orange. No, not at all. It was bare, just bare. And most  all stadiums were that way.  Who was your biggest rival in basketball?  Well, that   s a good question. Either OU or KU  University of Kansas .  KU was not in our league conference, but they were always a big home  rival. St. Louis was also. Mr. Iba had a big rivalry with Eddie Hickey at  St. Louis, and we played them home and home. They were in the  conference, but that conference stretched from Detroit to Houston.  Picture that.  Okay, we were talking about basketball and rivals.  OU was, of course, always a rival but that was given. But the real  basketball ones we had included Tulsa, because Mr. Iba   s brother  coached there. But KU, St. Louis, OU. And then we had Houston and  Detroit. We traveled by train mostly, and you   d have an overnight, and  Bob Mattick   is Bob still around here? I think he is. He was 6   10    or  6   11   . He got two berths, and the rest of us got one berth. And those  were overnight trips, and it was a nice   trains were nice. Good food and  the service was great   but that   s how we got around.  Peggy, were the students able to follow the team and go to any of the  out-of-town games ever?  I   m sure some did, like the pep clubs did, but I don   t think I went out of  town except for the all-college which was held in Oklahoma City during  the Christmas vacation. I would go to some of those games and a lot of  students, I think, went to those   but as far as going to Wichita or KU     Tulsa   there might have been some people went to those games.  There may have been     Probably OU, some.     but I didn   t.  I remember we played at OU. When we played here, the students got tin  cups, like tin drinking cups because of t-sips, and they   d bang those on  seats you know when the t-sips showed up. Now we did play against in  the all-college   you may have heard of Bill Russell, the famous  basketball player. I sat on the bench because it was my junior or  sophomore year   we played against Bill Russell and the San Francisco  team. I remember that, but I didn   t get close to Chamberlain. That was  14  Neurohr  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  the year afterward.  Did you have a favorite class or favorite professor when you were a  student here?  Favorite class     While you think about it, I   ll tell   Mr. White was one of my favorites.  He wasn   t a doctor, Professor White, and he taught humanities and I  loved that guy. He was wonderful. He made humanities live, and when I  decided to change my major to home economics because I thought I  probably wasn   t going to write the world   s best-selling novel, and  probably I was gonna need to learn to teach, I went to him and I said,     Professor White, I really need to change from Arts and Science. I   ve  loved your classes. I love what I   ve learned here.    He said,    That is so  ridiculous to go learn something that your mother can teach you. You  need to stay in Arts and Sciences.    And he was really good. Also,  Josephine Hoffer   when I went over to FRCD  Family Relations and  Child Development  and that was right in line with my profession with  early childhood development and Headstart. She was a wonderful  mentor. I also had Gertrude McAlester who was a great teacher. I just  had so many good teachers here.  I was in agricultural economics and, because I had come not off the farm  but worked in agriculture, they needed to find a major for me so they put  me in agricultural economics. I just came to play basketball. And when I  got in an economics course, Professor Trenton and Professor Leftwich     I remember Professor Trenton introduced me to The New York Times,  which I thought was just wonderful over at the library. I used to go over  and read it on occasion. And then Professor Leftwich who   his book  wasn   t out yet. I remember we would take off   one lecture would end  with where he was on the board and the next lecture would start at that  same point and he just wrote everything on the board, and I think that   s  the only class I made a    C    in. We didn   t have the book. We missed a  lot of classes, too, during the season, but I enjoyed those two guys along  with Professor Blakely in agricultural economics. So I had some good  ones, and had a guy in agronomy who said,    actually,    every other word.  Actually, actually. I remember that class. I don   t remember what I  learned in it, but I remember that class.  You learned not to say actually     I don   t say actually.     when you lectured.  15  Neurohr  C. Shafer  Neurohr  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  Neurohr  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  Neurohr  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  What did you do with a degree in agricultural economics when you  graduated?  Well, Peggy hadn   t graduated yet so I stayed here and got a master   s  degree in agricultural economics, then went to the Army   in New  Jersey. I was just one of those   they were full of officers so I   d come  through ROTC  Reserve Officer Training Corps  and I just was in for  six months. But if you have to be in the Army, be in Fort Monmouth  because it   s right south of New York City. We had a big time up there.  Then I went to Penn State and got the PhD and so that   s why I was at  Texas A M for 37 years in the faculty of agricultural economics. So I  stayed with it and its worked out okay, I think. I still go to Guatemala  once a year to teach down there   in English, not Spanish.  Well and you   re back today and who are the Cowboys playing today?  (Laughter)  Let   s see. We used to be the Aggies. They   re playing the Aggies. Texas  A M, when they changed their name   it   s a very traditional school and  they weren   t gonna change   they would let women in, against their  better judgment and they allowed the Corps to become volunteer rather  than mandatory, but they weren   t gonna change their name from A M,  so they kept it. So they   re still the Aggies. But we were Aggies when we  were here. We were the Oklahoma Aggies. Yeah.  And that   s who we   re playing today is Texas A M.  Yes, Texas A M.  So are your loyalties a little bit divided since you   re alumni here and  you   ve been in College Station for so many years?  Well, having played here I   d have to be for the Cowboys today.  Otherwise, we   re for the Aggies, you know.  If we   re not playing OSU.  Yeah. Yeah.  Do you try to come back for Homecoming every year?  No, we   ve come back for the last three years and we hadn   t been here  before. Isn   t that awful? But we have in the last three years.  Came back when Mr. Iba retired     16  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  Neurohr  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  That   s right.     and, other than that, we haven   t been back in 49 years I guess.  (Laughs) Don   t ask me why.  Well I think part of it was that we were working and you know     Yeah. Yeah.  It   s gotten easier.  Children and so on. But we really enjoy the Homecomings. You guys  knock yourselves out up here I swear to goodness. That   s why I asked if  anybody went to school in the fall because it looks like everybody   s out  working. Of course the pledges do, I   m sure, most of the heavy lifting.  Yeah.  What can you tell me about a connection with the university and how  that affects students over the course of their lives?  What do you think?  You go ahead.  Well that   s a good question. Of course you got an education there so it   s  hard to value how much that   s worth and I love Oklahoma A M and I  also have an Oklahoma State degree two years later. I mean, it was a  great place and who knows what you would have been without it. But I  don   t   I have no way of making that judgment. Now I   ve always felt a  strong attachment. I haven   t been   as you know, haven   t been back here  that often, but we knew it was always here and so it   s hard to put a  weight on it, but it was very important I think. Otherwise I   d have stayed  home and fixed radios or something if I hadn   t got this chance.  For you, somebody that paid your way   you know, you had a  scholarship     Free ride.     and I know you learned a lot from Mr. Iba because you quote him all  the time, and for me it was the professors who took an interest. Professor  White and Josephine Hoffer   and Josephine who was the one that  recommended I do things beyond what I ever thought I could do, and  believed in me. I just had wonderful hands-on experience at Oklahoma  State. From the very first class in child development, we were working  with children. And in home economics education, we went to Poteau to  17  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  Neurohr  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  Neurohr  P. Shafer  observe, then I did my student teaching at Pawnee, and I did all kinds of  other experiences, so I think   and I went to that luncheon, was it just  yesterday?  Yeah.  At the Human   what do they call that? Human     Human Environmental Sciences.  Environmental Sciences, and that   s one of the things that all the people  who were there who were being honored got up and said   the practical  things that they got to do while they were studying here made a big  difference in their careers, and I agree with that.  Yeah, the professors I remember now   in fact they   d come talk to me. I  studied hard because I was afraid I was gonna flunk out. You know, I  wasn   t a genius in high school, so that   s why I worked so hard. Most of  it was, you know, how much I learned and how much I wrote it, So I did  get good grades and they came and told me,    You should join this. You  should join that,    and so on and   which I wouldn   t have done that if  they hadn   t taken an interest. So I had some good professors.  And you should go to graduate school.  Yeah.  They were the ones that said you should go to graduate school and get a  PhD. So it was professors who really   as well as our parents, but     I wonder if they have time for that nowadays. I know they   re awfully  busy getting grants and stuff like that.  Well you did. I mean     Yeah, but     What do you think it   s like at Texas A M now?  Well it   s changed even from that.  It   s changed. I know.  What was the mascot when you were here   school mascot?  Pistol Pete, wasn   t it?  18  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P.

Shafer  There was a Pistol Pete, but you know it was just like on stickers. There  was no guy dressed up like Pistol Pete, was there?  I thought there was. (Laughter)  I don   t remember there being   if there was, he didn   t have the big head  as I recall. There was no horse. I   m sure of that.  No, there wasn   t a horse.  And, yeah, that wasn   t   there were probably   what   five cheerleaders?  Yeah, about that many.  At most. So all that was     I tried out for cheerleader and didn   t make it. (Laughs)  You did?  Yes.  I didn   t even know that.  Did I never tell you that? I don   t share that    (Laughter)  Couldn   t flip over backwards probably.  I couldn   t flip over backwards probably.  Nobody else did either. (Laughs)  Well the name of the university changed right after you left here.  That   s right.  How did you feel about that? We heard some people say that they were  okay with it and that they thought that the reasons that they changed the  name were good ones and that they didn   t mind that the university  changed its name.  I think I was okay with it.  Yeah, it was more   A M is kind of provincial in a sense if you think  it   s just for agriculture and engineering     19  P. Shafer  C. Shafer  P. Shafer  C.

The only thing is  there are a lot of state universities so it   s kind of a generic thing   but no,  it didn   t bother me.  I think it is more descriptive.  Yeah, and you can use THE state university. (Laughs)  One more thing that I would like to find out from you, Mr. and Mrs.  Shafer, is the reason that you decided to come to Oklahoma State  University. Peggy     Yes, well, all my family had gone to the University of Oklahoma, and  that   s where I thought I was headed. You know, there was no doubt. But  I made a visit up here with my band. I was a band member, and I fell in  love with Theta Pond and that   s probably not a very good reason to  choose your university, but it just felt right. The campus just felt right.  So that really was what made up my mind.  I didn   t see Theta Pond, but I remember   getting a chance to play  basketball at Oklahoma A M was a lifetime dream. I remember seeing  Mr. Iba in oatmeal ads, comic books and in other stuff. You know, that  was just   gosh, you couldn   t ask for anything more than that. So I was  just happy to come here and get that chance.  Is there anything else you   d like to share with us today?  I think this is a great idea that you   re doing this, and thank you for  taking time to be a part of this kind of gathering of history.  Well if it weren   t for people like you, we wouldn   t be able to do this and  so we truly appreciate that you took the time to come in and participate  in this project very much.  It was fun, thank you.  Glad to do it. Glad to do it.  Thank you.  -------  -------
