Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but we'll start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.

Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her place of birth is Alabama.  Her date of birth is November 14th, and I'm blanking on the exact year, I think, it's 1927.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 2: My mother's side of the family, my mom had, there were eight of them, one who died very young.  And then there was my mother, and then she had a brother right below her named Houston [Houston Townsel], then she had another brother right below him named Charles [Charles Townsel], then she had another brother right below, I'm sorry, sister right below him called, her, called Wilma [Wilma Townsel], then a brother right below them called Alvin [Alvin Townsel], I might have the order reversed, and then she had a brother, her youngest brother was Walter [Walter Townsel (ph.)].  And then her very first brother, who I never met, died as a child, I mean, I think he was less than ten years old.  And those were my mother's siblings, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did they grow up in rural Alabama or in Birmingham [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: No, they grew up in, well, I think they grew up in, started off in Huntsville [Alabama].  And when they exactly moved to Birmingham, I'm not totally certain as to, you know, whether, what, you know, what the date was when they actually moved from Huntsville to, to Birmingham.  When I say they, I mean, my grandparents, you know, I don't know whether my mom was born in Huntsville or Birmingham, I, I don't really know.  My brother [HistoryMaker Bishop Sedgwick Daniels] will know, when you talk to him, he'll know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, do, do you know much about your grandparents and what they were doing for a living and--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, oh yeah, I know the, my grandparents were Inez Townsel [Inez Harrison Townsel].  And I, she and my grandfather, General Townsel.  And--
Speaker 1: So his name is General just like a general?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  And he, he was a minister in Birmingham, my grandfather, was a minister in Birmingham and a barber.  And he was a minister at the First Baptist Church of West End [First Baptist Church West End, Birmingham, Alabama].  And my grandmother was basically a homemaker although she worked in, in a laundry sometime during that time period in, in Birmingham but there wasn't a constant thing, sometimes she'd work there, sometimes, you know, she wouldn't.
Story_ID: 448704
Speaker 1: Do you know much about your ancestors on, on your mother's [Kathryn Townsel Daniels] side?  Did they, how far back do they go?  Are there any stories from slavery or--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: But, but as far as I can go back on my, grand, my, my great-grandmother was called Mama Jane [ph.].  And Mama Jane, she must have been born, I'm gonna say in the late 1900s sometime.
Speaker 1: Late 1800s?
Speaker 2: Late 1800s.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.  And the, and that's really as far back as I can go in terms of my own personal recollection 'cause I knew her when I was a little kid in the early '50s [1950s], I would travel up to Detroit [Michigan] which is where she had then migrated to.  And we'd go up there, you know, during the summer and spend, you know, a week or two with her.  And then on my grandmother's side, my great-grandfather, he, he was called Papa [ph.] but I knew him too when I was a very young kid because when he was elderly he came to stay with my grandparents [Inez Harrison Townsel and General Townsel] and I was a young kid maybe, I don't know, maybe, you know, six or seven years old, and he was, you know, what seemed very old to me at that time.  And I think probably, my guess, is he was probably sixty-five to seventy-five so, you know, that's a, that would be my guess, so I knew him.  I mean, these are people I actually, you know, talked to, knew but before that I really don't have any knowledge or certainly no contact, those are the ones I knew and I really don't, I heard my grandmother talk about her mother but I don't ever, I don't ever, I, I, I never met her and my mom would talk about her grandmother, my grandmother's mother.  And they lived down in Huntsville [Alabama], well, I think Huntsville.  And but that's as far back as I can go on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there, is there any stories that are passed down from that side about (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know, they always, the, they would always tell me about the, that they had a, a farm down somewhere near Huntsville.  And that there were several like brothers, you know, close, and they all sort of farmed together and they got together for, you know, for holidays and that kind of stuff.  But, you know, in terms of actual details and stuff, I, I don't remember any, you know, like, you know, "Papa, did, you know, so and so and so and so," I, I don't remember that.  The, and when I was a kid I remember, you know, sort of talking to him and he was a very sort of quiet guy.  The, my grandmother on my mother's side was, she was very thoughtful and she would, you know, she would tell me stuff about the family when I was, a very young kid.  My grandfather didn't really tell me that much, you know, about, you know, the heritage before that.  I knew his brothers, he, you know, he had several brothers and they sort of, I think, left Alabama, gravitated to Michigan and so a lot of them ended up, I think, you know, working in the automobile factories and that kind of stuff up in, up in Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's a typical migration pattern, you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --to go to Detroit from Alabama--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --for some reason.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, like Mississippi--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and Milwaukee [Wisconsin], you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, exactly.
Story_ID: 448705
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Kathryn Townsel Daniels] grow up in Alabama or did she, did they move when she was young to the North (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, my, no, my, my mother grew up in Alabama.  My mother grew up in Alabama and she, she left Alabama and went to Michigan for a while and she was at, she was trained as a practical nurse at a hospital up, associated with the University of Michigan [University of Michigan School of Nursing, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  And then she returned back to Alabama.  And so I actually was born in Birmingham [Alabama] and then when I was a very young child we moved to Wisconsin.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, so she had a decent education down there right in--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in Alabama?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she went, well, you know, she went to, they, they had basically one high school, well, basically one high school in, in Birmingham called Parker High School [A.H. Parker High School, Birmingham, Alabama].  And it was a pretty big high school.  And they, so they all went, all of her brothers and sisters went through Parker High School and my mother was the oldest one other than her brother who died.  And so like the top three of 'em, she and the, right next below 'em went through high school down there and then sort of the next four or five or 'em, went on to, you know, college and graduate education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, for your mother to go to the University of Michigan that's a (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right, yeah, that was, that was different.
Story_ID: 448706
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about your mother's [Kathryn Townsel Daniels] personality?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, my mother was sort of the, a very, very, a friendly person, very religious, extremely, my family is extremely religious.  And my mother was extremely religious, the, and she was sort of a very caring type individual so all of her, every since I knew her, you know, she was always caring and working with people, helping people out.  And, I mean, she was, she became sort of legendary in this community for, for that kind of thing.  So, you know, when I was, you know she didn't have that much money but like when I was a kid, you know, she would, you know, go and find, you know, clothes and stuff for people and food for people and take it to, you know, take it to their house and that was all sort of out of her, a, a religious tradition that she did that.  And so she became sort of legendary in this community for, for that kind of, that kind of thing, and she loved it, I mean.  And, I mean, she did it without really very much money which was sort of the amazing part about it.
Speaker 1: So she was able to make resources to people who (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.  And I think the, I think the other thing is that some, some people, I think, are just sort of have the, I don't know what you call it but they have sort of the ability to, for people to realize that they're sincere, so if they got something, they said, "Well, give this, you know, I'm gonna give this to you, and you go find who really needs it."  And so I think she had, you know, that kind of, of, of outgoing type of spirit that people sort of picked up on.  So she did a, I mean, I can remember when I was a kid, you know, you know, she'd be, my mom didn't drive for a long time and she finally learned how to drive, she couldn't really drive that well, so, you know, she'd be driving around in this, you know, in this car with this food and these clothes and all this stuff, you know, taking it around to, to different people in the community and she loved it.  I mean, she, and it was, you know, it was something that, you know, she just, you know, felt strongly about.  So, I mean, she, she did, you know, (laughter) ever since I was a kid, she did that, you know, her whole life.  So the, and that sort of, you know, catches on to you, you know, the next generations, you sort of, you know, understand the value of that and so I mean that was, you know, that was something that, you know, we just grew up with, that was just sort of part of, you know, our family.
Story_ID: 448707
Speaker 1: Now did she work as a nurse (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  She worked--my mom [Kathryn Townsel Daniels] worked as a practical nurse, she worked as a, a social workers aide, she worked in the school system as a teachers aide, and she worked with a lot of, she worked with a lot of people.  And it was sort of interesting that, you know, the, when I thought, when I, my mom had sort of like several groups of people who she was friendly with, so she had all the church people, you know.  And she was, I mean, we, we grew up in the Church Of God in Christ which is a holiness church.  And my mom, that was sort of a change because my grandparents on both sides were Baptist and so when my mother converted that was not really that well received by, by her family.  And so the, but, she did and she, you know, and she sort of instilled that in the rest of the kids in the family.  And, you know, she just really believed.  So the, but well, saying she had several sets of friends so she had the church people, you know, who she was all, you know, very, very close with, and they looked up to her as a leader, you know.  And, you know, most of the people who were involved, you know, when she started in the church were people who, you know, were just regular working people.  And so she had that set of friends and they relied on her to sort of help, help them 'cause they thought she could, you know, obtain stuff and, and so she, you know, took on sort of that role with them.  And then, of course, you know, we had our family which is, you know, is a very close family.  And then she had a lot of, of, of friends who were, who I, I guess the best way to describe them were people who would be sort of, they were certainly more well-off than our family was, and a lot of these, her friends who were women, who were about her same age and vintage, you know, gravitated to, to her.  And I don't, I never really understood, you know, as her, as, 'cause a lot of 'em weren't as sort of, most of 'em were religious but not as religious as my mother.  I mean, my mother was devoutly religious.  And but they really liked talking to her when they were going through whatever they were going through.  I never knew all the, you know, the details so when I look back at my mom's friends and I look and see these ladies, you know, I see this common pattern, you know, of you have these, you know, you have these people in the church who looked up to her for resource and then you have people who had a lot more resources than she did who looked to her I think for like personal support, I, I think that's what it was.
Story_ID: 448708
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: John W. Daniels [John W. Daniels, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Senior, right?
Speaker 2: Senior, right.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Okay.  He was born in Dancy, Alabama.  And he was born July 24th, 1925, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  On my dad's side, I knew his mother and her name was Hattie [Hattie Marshal Daniels].  And I did not know, his father was named John [John Daniels, Sr.], too.  And my dad was the, my mom [Kathryn Townsel Daniels] was like the second oldest in her family, my dad was the second youngest, so my dad had like fifteen siblings, they were sixteen of 'em.  So my dad was the second youngest.  So his father was much older than my grandmother, that's what they used to always tell me, so I don't know what that meant.  I think, they got married when she was, I don't know, fifteen, sixteen, something like that.  And so how old he was I don't really know but they said, you know, he was older, so, you know, what, what that meant I'm not quite sure.  And the, my dad's oldest brother was born around 1900.  And so my grandmother was probably born in 1880 something or another.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That makes sense.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So are there any stories passed down in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, lots--
Speaker 1: --on that side of the family?
Speaker 2: --lots of stories--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --were passed down.  The, my grand- my grandmother was, they were from a place called Dancy, Alabama, which I, when I was, when I grew up I tried to go back and see what it really looked like, when I got there, you know, you drive by it and you miss it.  You, you know, it was just a little country spot.  And, in fact, you know, the biggest thing in that area now are Indian [Native American], Indian casinos.  So they were raised down there on the farm.  And the, they basically were sharecroppers, they worked for whoever it was that owned the land.  They may have had a little piece of land but basically they were working for someone else down there.  And the, my grandfather, who I never met him, on my dad's side, was, they had sort of this legend about him being sort of a guy who, let's just say wasn't the hardest worker in the world.  And, you know, all these people were out there, you know, working hard and sweating and, and he had all these kids, you know, they had fifteen or sixteen kids and the kids are out there working.  And so I think what happened is that as the kids got to be, you know, a relatively young age, they left the farm and went to Birmingham [Alabama] where there were these industrial jobs, you know, in the coal mines, steel mills, that kind of stuff.  And so they would all sort of as, I don't know how old they got to be but, you know, whenever they got to be, I don't know sixteen, whatever it was, you know, they would go up to, up to Birmingham and, you know, and get these jobs.  And so over a period of years they all did that.
Story_ID: 448709
Speaker 1: And then my dad [John W. Daniels, Sr.] had three brothers who were very close in age with him, he had a brother who was I think a year younger, brother who was two years younger, and a brother who was like a year or two older.  And so those four, in the war years, all went off to the [U.S.] military.  So my dad went to the [U.S.] Navy and a couple of 'em went to the [U.S.] Army, and I don't remember where the fourth one went.  So when I was kid you'd go into the, into my grandmother's [Hattie Marshal Daniels] house and she would have these four boys, you know, in military uniforms, you know, sitting up on the counter, you know.  And when I think that what happened was they went off to the military and, I think, my grandmother probably was still down in Dancy [Alabama] or wherever it was and I think when they got a little money from military service and here I don't know, my brother [HistoryMaker Bishop Sedgwick Daniels] will probably know, my brother knows, I'm much older than my brother but he knows much more history about the family than I do.  But I think what happened is when they got out of the military or when they were in the military sending money back, you know, either my, after my grandfather [John Daniels, Sr.] died or whatever, they bought a house for my grandmother and then she moved up to, to Birmingham [Alabama].  And then that's, you know, they all just sort of, were all in that, in that area.  And so when I was a kid, I, we would go down, I would go down to Birmingham every year to visit, you know, my grandmother.  And so I, because of that, you spend the summer down there, you get to know, you know, all the relatives and, you know, all the uncles and aunts and whatever.  And so it was really during those summers where, you know, I really got, you know, to know, more about, you know, the family.  And, and she was, you know, it was, you know, one of those kind of families where, you know, like I, one uncle I know, my, my oldest uncle, every day after work, you know, he would walk over to her house before he would go home so, you know, he, he may have been walking two or three miles so he'd come by and see my grandmother and then he would, you know, walk on to his house, you know, I mean, and every day he would do that.  And then other, you know, uncles, you know, they would, you know, I would see all of them and I would know all of them.  And that was, that came through the, through the summer, but in terms of, you know, actual sort of knowing what happened down in Dancy, I didn't, I didn't know too much about that.
Story_ID: 448710
Speaker 1: These were like, like the '50s [1950s] and--
Speaker 2: The '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: --basically and the Civil Rights Movement was stirring up a little bit--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --down there and I mean were there any signs of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The--
Speaker 1: --the movement?
Speaker 2: Not really, not when I was there because the, the only, the, the first sign I had of the Civil Rights Movement was I had some uncles who were at Alabama State [Alabama State College for Negroes; Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama] and the, they graduated from Alabama State probably, I'm gonna say in the '50s [1950s], I'm gonna say in the '50s [1950s].  And, and then I had a brother, my oldest brother [Roosevelt Daniels] graduated from school in Alabama from Stillman College [Tuscaloosa, Alabama] down there.  And he graduated probably in the early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Now, Alabama State's in Montgomery [Alabama] right?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: That's where the bus boycott was going on.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.  So I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And did they talk about that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: You know, I think, that, I think it was just sort of starting, you know, when, when, when they were there.  But see they were all gone by, they were all gone from Alabama by the end of the '50s [1950s], so I think that, you know, sort of, when, you know, when it really was, you know, more focused then they were probably, you know, in Michigan but I think as students they were, the, the beginnings of it 'cause I've heard them talk about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it started in '56 [1956] so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've heard them talk about--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, you know, things like that.  But the, and I know when my brother was there in the late '50s [1950s], I know at that point, you know, that was really when, you know, the sit-ins and the marches and the protests and that kind of stuff.
Story_ID: 448711
Speaker 1: --Now your dad [John W. Daniels, Sr.], now, now, what did he, did he grow up in, so he, he, he grew up in Alabama?
Speaker 2: He grew up in Alabama and, you know, and then he went to the [U.S.] military.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then after he finished the military, he went to work for the railroad as a porter.  And so he would, he would go from, I think, they called it the L and N Rail, Railroad [Louisville and Nashville Railroad].  So he would, you know, go from wherever they went from Alabama up to, I think, Chicago [Illinois], I think Chicago.  And, and he had really learned sort of, I think probably in the military sort of refrigeration, mechanic, type stuff.  So he ultimately ended up working for the [U.S.] Navy as a, basically a maintenance mechanic at military bases.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is that, that a pretty good job?  (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that was a good job, that was a good job, (laughter) yeah, that was a good job.
Speaker 1: All right.  So what brought him to--
Speaker 2: Milwaukee [Wisconsin]?
Speaker 1: --yeah, Milwaukee?
Speaker 2: You know, that's a good question.  I don't know the answer to that because I think, they, his brothers had basically gravitated to Chicago and that was really where he worked at the, at the naval ordnance in Chicago.
Speaker 1: At Great Lakes [Naval Station Great Lakes, Lake County, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Not Great Lakes, I think, it was on Roosevelt Road or something out there in Chicago.  And that was originally sort of where he, where he worked but I think that he felt like Milwaukee was a better city for a family.  So actually when I was growing up my dad would, he moved us to Milwaukee, he worked in Chicago so he would get up, I don't know, four o'clock in the morning, you know, whatever, drive to Chicago, you know, go to work and then come back that evening.  And so because, you know, for him that was a good job, you know, and the, so he did that for, you know, many, many years.
Story_ID: 448712
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Kathryn Townsel Daniels and John W. Daniels, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: I, the story they tell me is that they met in, in Alabama and that my dad was, I don't know, they said his baseball games or something, you know, on Sunday afternoon, you know, and that's how they met.  I never got the full story.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So they, they were actually married in Alabama then?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what did they move to Milwaukee [Wisconsin] about 1948, '40 [1940]?
Speaker 2: No, no, oh, no, no.
Speaker 1: No, you, you were born in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you were born in--
Speaker 2: Mid-'50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mid-'50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  Now, when you think about your parents' personalities--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and their talents and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --their, you know, you know, what they were prone to do and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what their, you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --dispositions were, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm probably a mixture of my parents.  The, I'm not as empathetic or compassionate as my mother, you know, I wish I was but I'm not and, and frankly there aren't that many people, you know, and I don't, I'm not just saying this because it was my mother, who really had that kind of personal disposition.  The, my father was very like a lot of guys' parents who I knew, from that, they just wanted their kids to do better, you know.  So if it took working two or three jobs, you know, they would do it.  And their, really their, I think their real thing that in their life that motivated them was seeing their kids do better.  And so I, you know, sort of that ambition part probably comes from my dad.  You know, sort of interest in, you know, in finding ways to help people that that would come from my mother.  But so, you know, sort of a mixture of, of, of the two.  The, and I mean I think the thing of my mom's, yeah, I'm religious but not as religious as the rest of my family.  But just sort of the values, you know, just, you know, be honest, do the right thing, you know, those basic things that, you know, you, you sort of like get pounded into you and pounded and pounded, you know.
Story_ID: 448713
Speaker 1: I'm tempted to ask like what, what do you mean by not as religious or, I mean, in, in that sense?  I, I know, you have a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --brother that's a reverend [HistoryMaker Bishop Sedgwick Daniels]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --a bishop actually but--
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, the, my family, well, when I grew up, I mean grew up in the holiness church and that was a very strict church, you know, very, very strict church.  And--
Speaker 1: This is Church Of God in Christ?
Speaker 2: The Church Of God in Christ.  And, you know, I'm, I still go to the Church Of God in Christ.  The, and so I mean, you know, I would say if you asked my brother what he believes, you know, there are certain things that he believes just, you know, without a doubt that, you know, I might say well I think I believe that but, you know, I'm not as certain as he is.  And so and, you know, I admired it in, you know, I admired it, you know, that, you know, that, I wish I was more like that.  But I'm saying, and, and I'm not saying I'm not religious 'cause I would feel bad if I, you know, I'm just saying I'm not as, sort of, as religious as my family.  And, I mean, I, you know, I give credit to 'em 'cause I mean what they say they actually do, it's not, you know, some, you know, say one thing and do another, I mean, (laughter) what they believe they really put in practice.
Speaker 1: But you're saying is, your, your values were shaped by how you were brought up (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, it is no question, there is no question that my values were shaped by, to a large extent by my family's religious background.  I mean, the, I mean, just sort of, just core fundamental, what do you believe, you know, you know, how will you treat people, that was, you know, you know.  I didn't recognize it when I was a kid, you know, as it was being sort of, you know, you know, sort of presented to me but, you know, it's, you know, it's something that gets deeply ingrained in you and, you know, when it gets ingrained in you, you know, you know, sometimes you can rebel against it, you know.  I mean you'll, I mean obviously, you know, I went through the same stages everybody else, you know, you go through college you think you're smarter than whatever, whatever, you know.  But I think, you know, sort of that, you know, that sort of belief system is, I mean, that's central to, you know, like who I feel I am as a person.
Speaker 1: Now, now your, your, your mother [Kathryn Townsel Daniels] brought the family to the Church Of God in Christ, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And was there, is there a story about that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --conversion?
Speaker 2: Well, see the, I'll tell you the story I heard, okay.  The, like I said my grandfather was a Baptist minister.  And, you know, when I was growing up, when I was growing up the, in that community the minister was really an, a very, it was a little bitty community but, you know, Reverend Townsel [General Townsel] was, you know, like, you know, the next thing to God, you know, in that little community.  And the, I think that the Church Of God in Christ was founded about a hundred years ago.  And so the, the fundamentalist beliefs of the Church Of God in Christ were, I think looked down on by the general sort of community.  And so when my mom got involved with the Church Of God in Christ, I don't think her, my grandfather, you know, (laughter) he didn't raise his kids not to be Baptist is, is, is how I would describe it.  And, I mean, not that he would, you know, say anything adverse to my mother but, you know, if he had his preference, you know, that wouldn't have been his, his preference.  And so I think there was a little Church Of God in Christ in the neighborhood that, that would, that was there and it was a little, I think it was a smaller church whereas my grandfather's church, it was small too but when I was a kid I thought it was big, you know.  And in fact, you know, like when I grew up and went back and looked at the church, you know, I'm thinking, you know, my grandfather is a preacher at First Baptist Church [First Baptist Church West End, Birmingham, Alabama] and in the back of my mind, you know, you know, it had blown up about, you know, ten times to what it really was when I went back and actually looked at it.
Speaker 1: A lot of things in childhood seem bigger (laughter).
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.
Story_ID: 448714
Speaker 1: So people in the Church Of God in Christ are, are known as sanctified, right?  Is that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: And what, what does that mean in reference to other people?
Speaker 2: You know, I, I think that the, and like I said I grew up in the Church Of God in Christ, you know, since I was a kid.  And I mean I think that, you know, they have very strong beliefs about what, you know, and, you know, very strong belief in very specific rules, you know.  You can't smoke, you can't drink, you can't, you know.  I mean when I was a kid that was sort of, you know, the, you know, and so when I was, you know, when I was growing up as a kid, you know, they would say, "Well, you go to that Sanctified church, you know, you know, you can't do this," you know.  So the, and I think that, you know, the reality of it was that when I was, when I was a youngster, it was like a little less socially acceptable, you know, you know, it was basically the poor people's church, you know.  A little less socially acceptable and then over time, it still is a difference in view about it, but I think over time, you know, you'll find, you know, like a lot of people, you know, a lot of my friends, you know, in business or government or arts or whatever now, and, you know, we sit down and we talk and a lot of them came out of, you know, the same kind of background.  And, you know, and most of the ones I talked to will say even if they don't believe in all of those things, they appreciate sort of like the, the, the strength of character that it, you know, that it creates in you.  I mean, they don't like the rules, I don't like all the rules but I think that, you know, in terms of just sort of, you know, you know, who can you trust, you know, somebody gives you your word are they gone really stand by it, you know, you know, are they going to, you know, if somebody's in your family is ill are they really gonna feel a compassion for you as a person.  A lot of that, a lot of those things, you know, really, they're just true.  I mean, and, I mean, I, I'm not saying it's not true in other, you know--
Speaker 1: Well, in the general population it's not necessarily true so--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I guess the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --by culturally--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, focusing--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --or defining a group you--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --create a, the kind of culture you want.
Speaker 2: And I think that culture is, it's more humanistic, I think is what it is.  So, which made it harder for me because the ambition is sort of like, it's very difficult to define sort of what, what you see in sort of mainstream ambition as consistent with, you know, some of those religious values.  So, I mean, that's, that's a tension, you know, that does exist.  And, you know, and not just for me probably for, you know, a lot of people who have been through that, you know, through that experience.
Story_ID: 448715
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I think my earliest childhood memory is with, at my grandmother's house, when I was probably, I had to be, I'm, I'm gonna say about like four or five somewhere around there, you know.  And with my brothers and sisters, you know, we'd go down there for Christmas on the holidays, you know, so we would drive, you know, you know, over to my grandmother's house.  And that's my earliest, you know, my earliest memory is I, a Christmas where, you know, when I couldn't have been any more than four or five, you know, opening whatever gifts we had, you know, we got a bicycle maybe three of us had to share the bicycle, you know.  The, and then, you know, the big Christmas dinners, you know, where they all are specialty, you know, recipes and all that stuff, you'd go to one grandmother's house, then you go to the other grandmother's house.  I mean, that, you know, and, I mean, that's the first, you know, that is my earliest memory as a person, you know, the, the holiday, you know, when I was a very young kid.
Story_ID: 448716
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: The, well, I think, the things that I remember were things like my [maternal] grandparents [Inez Harrison Townsel and General Townsel], you know, would make ambrosia which was like a fruit, then coconut and whatever else was in there.  And, you know, sweet potato pies and chicken.  And, you know, my grandfather being a minister the, there was a tradition which actually I didn't even realize it was a tradition until some, someone was interviewing me for an article, maybe about two years ago, every Sunday our family gets together and when I say our family, I mean, the family here in Wisconsin, gets together, you know, so, you know, after church, you know, we go over to, now, my sister's house and we have dinner together.  Well, that went back, I mean, that goes back forever because when I was, when I was a little kid my grandparents would, they would go to church, they'd finish church, and then you would go, everybody would come over for dinner, Sunday dinner.  So you would have Sunday dinner.  So it started with my grandparents, then when my mom [Kathryn Townsel Daniels] was alive, it would be here, after my mom died, then my sister and brother took it up.  So for ever since I can remember in life, you know, you know, Sunday like, you, you know, you go to church then you go eat with your family and talk and, you know, talk about everything, you know, politics, you know, church, you know, anything, you know.
Speaker 1: And that's something now, now, do you, do you think that, you know, that's the experience of most people these days?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't, you know, I don't really know because I was surprised when they, when the, when the, when the, when the journalist wrote this article about our family, I was surprised how many people commented on the fact that, you know, we get together on Sundays.  But I always thought it was not that uncommon that, you know, that families got together on, on Sunday.  Now, maybe that's a southern tradition, you know, and like me, with me, I mean, even, even when I wasn't regularly attending church I would still go over to the, you know, after church to get together with them.  So that's just like, you know, it's Sunday, we gone, we're, we're, you know, we're gonna all get together.  You know, some people do it differently.  I have friends who they tell me that they get on the phone with their brothers and sisters every Saturday morning and, you know, five and six of 'em on the phone talking, you know.  And, you know, "What are you talking about?" "Well, we're just talking," you know.  But, you know, our, our tradition was that, you know, that Sunday, Sunday after church and like I said I'm sure it went on even before I was born but I know (laughter) since I've been born it's been going on.
Story_ID: 448717
Speaker 1: What would you describe your personality as like when you were growing up?  I mean, what, what were your, what were you drawn to and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what were you like?
Speaker 2: I was, I was interested in, in books when I was growing up.  And when I say books I mean that, I sort of gravitated towards, I think everybody gravitates toward stuff that they think that they have some ability in and they're comfortable with.  So I was always sort of comfortable with, with the educational system, performing inside the educational system.  When I say that I mean, you know, so, you know, school was attractive to me, you know, attractive in the sense that, you know, it, you know, I did well, so it got reinforced so that reinforces you wanting me to do more and it sort of, you know, and people are, "Oh, that's, you know, that's, you know, John [John W. Daniels, Sr.] and Kat's [Kathryn Townsel Daniels] boy, you know, he's real smart."  So you, you know, that sort of got reinforced when I was a kid, you know, sort of growing up so I wasn't real, you know, social, you know.  The, and people say I'm not real social now but, you know, in, in the profession that I'm in, you know, you learn over time that, you know, books are like not really that critical, it's really, you know, being able to deal with people and understand their problems and, you know, motivate people.  Which, you know, is sort of, that's sort of something that lawyers are not that good at because they're not, they're not as resilient of people as people think they are.  You know, they wanna focus on being in charge, they wanna be directive, and, you know, that's not really how you solve a lot of problems.
Story_ID: 448718
Speaker 1: Now you walk with a noticeable limp--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --right, now, now did this happen when you were a child (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yeah, I--
Speaker 1: Is there a story behind that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I had a, well, I, when I was born, the, I had atrophy of my right leg.  And the, they say it was polio but, you know, this is like in the late '40s [1940s] so who knows really what it was.  So the, I, when I was a kid I had a brace, you know, on my right leg, and then the, so I walked with a brace until I was, I don't know, six years old, seven years old.  And then my mom [Kathryn Townsel Daniels] said, "Well, you know, you don't need the brace," so I took the brace off.  But still a physical, you know, fact of having one leg that's shorter than the other one, you know, you have to sort of, you know, adjust to that.  So, you know, the, you know, they did a little corrective surgery, you know, to help it a little bit but it was, you know, no, since birth, you know, I had it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it had, did it cause you any problems in school or anything or did you have any--
Speaker 2: The, it didn't really cause me any problems in school.  The, in fact, the, the only time that I really, and I, yeah, sort of look back on it now, before I was like, I don't know, eleven, twelve, I was very self-conscious about it, you know.  And then as I got to a point, one of the guys who was like the assistant principal in the school said, "Well, you know, it is what it is.  You know, you know, deal with it, live with it, you know, and move on."  And so since I could do most of the stuff I wanted to do so, you know, I could play basketball, I could play football, not like, not as well as the guys I hung around with but well enough to play, you know, well enough to go out and play and do what I wanted to do.  So it never really, it never was really a big thing for me personally once I got past, I would say about ten or eleven.
Speaker 1: Okay.  'Cause I know there's a certain period of time in kids' lives where they're--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --self-conscious about everything anyway so (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I was (unclear) I think, you know, probably, you know, probably about ten or eleven, you know, is sort of, and, and it, and it was good for me that that guy said, you know, you know, "Deal with it," you know, you know, what I'm saying.  And he was, I mean, this was sort of a strict Italian assistant principal, and I think what it was is this guy was telling me, you know, "Do you wanna climb this rope?" You know, and I was thinking well I can't climb that rope and his thing was like, "Are you gonna try?" You know, (laughter) you know, and, "See what you can do."  And that was good, you know, it was good for me because it let me know try it, you know, and if you can't do it, you know, it's not the end of the world but at least, you know, you're not gonna sort of use it as an excuse for not trying.  And so that was, you know, after that it, you know, pretty much was like, you know, it wasn't something that, you know, really bothered me or anything like that.
Story_ID: 448719
Speaker 1: Now you say you liked to read.  Did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was, I would, I, I liked math.  I liked math a lot.  And so I spent, you know, a lot of the time, you know, with math.  I liked science and I liked, you know, literature but not as much.  And I wasn't, you know, I wasn't, you know, a, a person who was sort of in love with, you know, the great writers of all time, you know, I read 'em but that wasn't really what, you know, fascinated me.  What fascinated me was math and science and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, where did you start school? What, what school did you start at?
Speaker 2: I started at, well, I actually started in Birmingham [Alabama] and which was a segregated school.
Speaker 1: What, what was the name of it?  (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Graymont [Graymont Elementary School, Birmingham, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And by segregated you mean it was a, a all-black school; right?
Speaker 2: It was legally segregated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that meant that black students had to go to that school (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, it was legally, I mean, there was no, in fact, the, the, you know, I, I tell people in, that, you know, I started school in legally segregated, you know, two, three bed, two, three room school and finished at Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And I said, you know, that's really, you know, my life story.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you moved to Milwaukee [Wisconsin] where did you, where did you go?
Speaker 2: McKinley High, McKinley grade school [McKinley School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then on to Wells Junior High School [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and then to Custer High School [Milwaukee, Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Custer High School, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Named after George Armstrong Custer?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was this a black high school?
Speaker 2: No, no.  The, when, when I moved to Milwaukee in the mid-'50s [1950s], the, the black population in Milwaukee was not very large at that point in Milwaukee.  So when I went to high school there probably were, I don't know, maybe three thousand kids there and maybe, I don't know, maybe seventy-five African American kids at Custer High School.  And, you know, it was in a working class neighborhood.  And so the, so when my parents [Kathryn Townsel Daniels and John W. Daniels, Sr.]  moved to that neighborhood, you know, you know, they bought a house up there and that high school was predominantly white.
Story_ID: 449115
Speaker 1: Now, you were the telling the story about housing and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and segregation in Milwaukee [Wisconsin].
Speaker 2: Yeah, my parents [Kathryn Townsel Daniels and John W. Daniels, Sr.] came, came here in the, in the mid-'50s [1950s] and then they, they probably rented for a year or so, then they bought a house and the home they bought, urban renewal came in, so the home was, you know, taken for, for development.  So they started looking around for another home.  So the place they bought and where we really grew up was in an area that was on the northwest side of the city.  And it was an area that in the late '40s [1940s], early '50s [1950s], a group of African Americans had bought lots, a lawyer had sort of navigated all of this.  So they bought these lots and within like a, I'm gonna say like a three or four block area, these families went out there and built homes.  And so the guy we bought our home from was one of the first, he was part of this group, he was an architect, so he was an architect.
Speaker 1: What was his name, do, do you, do you remember?
Speaker 2: I think his name was Eggleson [ph.].  And he was an architect and the, so we bought our home from this guy because this guy I think had become disappointed with the opportunities in Milwaukee and so they had all, you know, so we had this little two or three block area out there that was, let's say if there were forty-five homes, maybe fifteen of 'em were African American, which is very unusual because if you went around the rest of the area it was like, you know, 99 percent, you know, white.
Speaker 1: So it was like an island in the middle of this--
Speaker 2: Right.  They had, they wanted to, they wanted better homes, they wanted to buy the homes, they wanted to avoid, you know, sort of the redlining that had occurred, you know, you can't move north of whatever street, so they just went, you know, several miles northwest, they had bought these lots.  So what happened when I was a kid, a lot of the families that I grew up with who became, you know, very good personal friends, you know, during my whole life, I mean, their stories were almost identical to mine.  So you would sit down and you would talk and you would say, you know, Mr. and Mrs. Moseley [ph.] came to Milwaukee in, I don't know, '40 [1940], late '40s [1940s] or '50s [1950s], you know, went to work at, you know, X, Y, Z company, you know, had a, you know, five or six kids, we all went to school together, high school together, grade school together, you know, ended up in each other's weddings, you know, and, you know, became really, you know, lifelong friends.  And when we were kids what we would do is we would in the summer, we would all go, you know, play basketball, play football together.  And so when we had, when I went to Custer High School [Milwaukee, Wisconsin], you know, the, all of the kids who were in that neighborhood we sort of knew each other.  And the, the, the guy, the lawyer who, I think his name was Brantley [ph.], was the guy who sort of came up with this idea of finding a way to create home ownership opportunity for African Americans.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's a, that's an interesting story.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Buying the homes on the perimeter of the--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --community knowing it's gonna spread and then--
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: --buying the lots and then having 'em (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.
Speaker 1: --when they spread.
Speaker 2: That's the way to do it, I guess.
Story_ID: 449116
Speaker 1: Now did you have any mentors in high school, any, any special teachers?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was in high school, the, I was sort of very active in, you know, all the student activities out there.  And what I was really active in was debate.  And so I with another friend [Richard Porter] of mine who is an attorney here now, we were debate partners.  And so we, we would go around and debate and the, we gained quite a reputation in the community for being, you know, very good.  So we were debating the top teams across (laughter) the state and we were winning.  And, you know, we, we're lifelong friends.  And he went off to, you know, law school, I went off to law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and we, you know, when we finished we, you know, hooked back up, you know, as friends here in, in Milwaukee [Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you all were on the Custer [Custer High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] debating team?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we, the Custer debating team, which, you know, before the, we came on was just, you know, sort of, I mean, it wasn't anything great.  And then we, we, we were, you know, very fortunate to have, you know, a very good group and it was sort of unusual because you had, you know, two African American guys, and a white guy and a white female and, you know, here are these, they're coming out of the public school system and they're going up and they're, you know, beating, you know, the top teams in, you know, in, in the state.  So, you know, we were all over the state debating and, you know, we gained quite a reputation behind that.
Speaker 1: Now did you run for class office or anything?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did.  I ran for vice president of student council.  In fact, my buddy, the guy we debated with, he, he and I ran against each other and he won by, I don't know, he knows how many votes he won by, he reminds me of that all the time.
Speaker 1: Did you have a candidates' debate (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No, no, but I mean, but the, it, it, it was, it was sort of, you, you know, in high school, you sort of have, one group of people and they're sort of, you know, the favorite candidates to win.  And so I was sort of a maverick I went on the other group, I thought if I could win with them it would really be great (laughter).  Little did I know that, you know, stick with, you know, stick with the winner and you'll be okay.  But, I mean, he laughs about it, he knows how many votes, you know, I've blocked out how many votes he won by but, yeah, I don't know twenty or thirty votes, you know, but it was, you know, it was like, but we had been, well, you know, debate partners, you know, his, his son I'm his godfather to his son.  And, you know, we, we remained friends through the whole life.
Story_ID: 449117
Speaker 1: You were in school in, in the mid-'60s [1960s], I guess, right?  In high school [Custer High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so.  That was the time of a lot of, I guess, when they were demonstrating in Mississippi, a lot of--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --things were going on around--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --did, did you pay particular attention to what Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] and SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] were doing?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was in high school, not too much.  The, I, I just remember that when Dr. King gave his speech, that was really when I really, that was really something that sort of just sort of changed my whole thinking.
Speaker 1: Is this the speech in '63 [1963], at the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.
Speaker 1: --March on Washington?
Speaker 2: That changed my whole thinking because the, when I was a youngster, you know, being from Alabama, so when they would have the Miss America pageant, I was pulling for Miss Alabama.  I mean, I, I, I mean, really, literally I was pulling for Miss Alabama 'cause it had not really sort of, you know, sunk into me sort of, you know, what was what.  So the, and when I was in high school, being in a high school that was, you know, virtually all white, it, you sort of, you sort of get sort of, I won't say shielded but you're in an environment where, you know, it's not as prevalent of an issue.  And it didn't, you know, it really didn't, you know, it really didn't hit me until I was a senior, no I was--yeah, I was a senior in high, senior or junior in high school.

Speaker 1: Had a very good friend of mines who was the captain of the football team, he was an African American guy, one of these families that grew up in the neighborhood, and he was a very nice guy, so everybody liked him, that's how he got to be the captain of the football team, you know, he was a good player, everybody liked him, he was a good student.  And the tradition in that high school [Custer High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] was that the captain of the football team was the king of the homecoming court.  That was automatic.  So if you were the captain of the football team, that's what, you were automatically the king who escorted the homecoming queen. The homecoming queen was picked by, you know, the kids in the high school. And so the, they vote, there were no, well, I shouldn't say no, there were very few black girls, 'cause there, you know, who were seniors, let's say five out of, you know, I don't know, six hundred or whatever it was, you know.  And so they voted and the girls who won were the girls who were popular, I mean, you know, the girls you would expect to win.  So obviously there are no, there were no minority girls on the homecoming court of five or six girls.  And so I was walking home with, you know, my friend, he would, you know, I would be in, I don't know, debate club and he would be in football and then we'd, we'd get together and walk home together after school.  And the, so we're walking home and, and he said something to me like, you know, "What do you think?"  And I said, "Think about what?"  And he said, "Well, you know, the coach of the football team called me in today and he told me that, you know, you know, we've traditionally done it this way but this year we're gonna do it a different way."  And the, and it was an, it, it, it was an explanation, he didn't really tell my friend exactly what was going on, he made it seem like, you know, we're doing it this way because of, I don't know, you know, whatever the explanation was.  And so we were walking home and we're trying to figure out what is the real reason.  So you're trying to tell your friend, you know, the real reason is not because of race, but he's saying well, "How could that not be?" You know, you know, it's been, you know, it's been done that way for, forever.  And that was really the first time, you know, I must have been a senior.  That was the first time it really sort of in a real live way, in a personal way that, you know, I observed it.  Because before I mean, I was like, captain of the debate team, I was on the student council, you know, I was president of the Latin club, you know, you know, a lot of my friends, you know, were white, you know, and, you know, it didn't really, it had never really sort of hit me in a direct way, and that was the first time.
Speaker 2: Now, was there any interracial dating when you were in high school?  Did, did--
Speaker 1: There was some but it was sort of, you know, looked down on.  I mean, you know, it was discouraged.  And I think the, I think the football coach's concern was, you know, he didn't want to create a controversy.  So he was trying to find a way to avoid a controversy.  And, you know, my friend was very accepting of it, you know, what could he do, I mean really but, you know, was very accepting of it.  But that was sort of like the first time, and I said, "Oh, boy, you know, I really do need to, you know, step back and take a look at this."
Story_ID: 449119
Speaker 1: Oh, I asked you a question earlier but I don't know if there, if there was an answer, but was, was there any mentors in high school [Custer High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: Oh, mentor.  Oh, yeah, the, I mean, the, the guy who was coaching the debate team he was a mentor.  And the, the guy who was head of the national honor, prince, teachers, I mean they were very, very supportive, extremely supportive.  The, and--
Speaker 1: So you were in National Honors Society?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I was, I was a very good student when I was in, in high school because I liked it.  You know, if you like something, you know, you put more effort into it so, so I liked it.  And, and it was sort of part of my self-image, you know, even with my wife [HistoryMaker Irma Daniels], you know, she didn't like me 'cause she thought I was like a bookworm, you know, right, so.  The, but the, that was just sort of part of my self-image, you know.  I would go to church I'd have a trigonometry book in my hand, you know, you know.  And I would say to her, you know, "Do they teach y'all trigonometry at your school," you know, right.
Speaker 1: So you enjoyed the role of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I loved.
Speaker 1: --being a bookwork and being a smart guy--
Speaker 2: Oh, I loved it.
Speaker 1: --they say the smart person.
Speaker 2: Oh, I loved it.  And, you know, and my, you know, and the guys I hung around with they, you know, they would always, you know, you know, give me grief about it but, you know, we all grew up like together so, it was like, you know, it was just part of being part of the group, they knew that was sort of like, you know, who I was and they would kid me about it, you know, and they would say well, you don't know this, you know, you know, so, it was (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Try to quiz you (unclear).
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.  That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's, that's, that's interesting 'cause--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --today they talk about kids not wanting to be smart and I'm not sure that's not true for everybody but that's--
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, I think even then, you know, it was like, you know, the smartest guy, I wasn't the smartest guy, the smartest guy was another friend of mine who was just brilliant, the guy was just absolutely flat out brilliant and he was a National Merit Scholar, you know, you know, 4.0 [grade point average] student straight through.  And, and in fact his family was from Birmingham [Alabama] too.  His dad, in fact, his dad went to the same high school as my mother [Kathryn Townsel Daniels].  And but he was just a brilliant guy.  But he was a brilliant guy who everybody knew was brilliant and so whereas they would kid me, "Well, John [HistoryMaker John W. Daniels, Jr.], why you got that trade book under your arm, you're just showing off," you know, what I'm saying.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you were bright if you were in National Honors Society, you were (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I was a good, yeah, I was a very good student, yeah.
Story_ID: 449120
Speaker 1: You mentioned Birmingham [Alabama] in the '60s [1960s] now, this is about '63 [1963], '64 [1964] or something we're talking about?
Speaker 2: In high school [Custer High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], '63 [1963]--
Speaker 1: Yeah, (unclear)
Speaker 2: --to '66 [1966], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And did, did, did, did your parents [Kathryn Townsel Daniels and John W. Daniels, Sr.] know any of the people in Birmingham that that were involved in the bombing of the church, I mean, that, that, that got hurt down there in '63 [1963] when the 16th Street Baptist Church [Birmingham, Alabama] was bombed or--
Speaker 2: Oh, well, yeah.
Speaker 1: -or people arrested during the school crisis down there when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and James Bevel [HistoryMaker Reverend James Bevel]--
Speaker 2: They knew people who were, well, my grandfather [General Townsel], I think all of the Baptist, a lot of the Baptist ministers were--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Fred Shuttlesworth [HistoryMaker Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth] was (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) were involved in the, you know, civil rights activity.  And I've never seen it but the, I think, in Detroit [Michigan] they, do they, is it in Detroit they have the civil rights museum?
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: I think they have a civil rights museum in Detroit and I think somewhere there's a, a clip from my grandfather in there.  'Cause I think most of those ministers in Birmingham, you know, were active, well, I shouldn't say most, a lot of 'em were supportive.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's, I know there's a display at Charles Wright Museum [Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History, Detroit, Michigan] and I think there have been exhibits there on--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --civil rights and I, I think there's--
Speaker 2: Well, there's some place over there 'cause my brother [HistoryMaker Bishop Sedgwick Daniels] has told me about it, you know, but that has a tape of my, of my grandfather, you know, involved in the civil rights there.  The, and I think, you know, I mean, that's, that was such a small community that, you know, even though, you know, people will never forget, you know, bombing a church, I mean, that's like, you know, who could, you know, (laughter) you can't even fathom it, you know, what I'm saying?  And so, I remember, I remember, you know, all of those events, you know, of that, of that time.
Speaker 1: Wallace [George Wallace] standing in the door of the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama] that's, I think, that was '64 [1964], I believe.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And that was when, I mean, when, with Wallace standing in the door, I mean, you, you, that, you know, you don't forget that image, you know.  I mean, you just never forget that image.  The, but, you know, it was more or less at that point that, you know, I was seeing, visualizing it over TV, you know, so I, you know, we'd see Dr. King in '63 [1963], you see Wallace, whatever, you know, year, slightly thereafter, then you see, James Meredith, University of Mississippi [Oxford, Mississippi], you know, all of that, you know, was sort of, you know, compressed in a very, you know, tight time period.
Story_ID: 449121
Speaker 1: Now, did you get good counseling when you, when you were thinking about college?  Did you--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --get good, good counseling in high school [Custer High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: You know, not really.  The, I was fortunate that my grades and test scores were sort of good enough that, you know, when schools would come in, you know, that, you know, I would get a chance to, you know, you know, to be considered.  But I graduated like mid-year 'cause we had, you could graduate in January or June so I graduated in, in January.
Speaker 1: This is in '66 [1966], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I graduated in January of '66 [1966].  And so the schools I would have gone to, like, Ivy League schools, you know, I'd have to wait until the fall.  And I was afraid that if I waited until the fall, that something would happen and I would never start.  So I, I got recruited to a small school in Illinois, North Central College [Naperville, Illinois], which is about, I don't know, thirty miles from Chicago [Illinois], I think, twenty-five or thirty miles, out in a little town called Naperville [Illinois].  And it was an EUB [Evangelical United Brethren] school, a Methodist school now.  And it probably had, I don't know, twelve or 1300 students.  And they took, you know, people at mid-year, they gave me a scholarship.  So I went down there and I thought, I, well, I'll go down here for a semester and then I'll transfer to, you know, a big name, in my mind, a bigger named school.  So I went down there, I really liked it.  And so, you know, when you get some place you're comfortable and you like it, you meet people and I just stayed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So what did you like about it?  I mean, was it--
Speaker 2: The, I liked the, that you could be, you know, it was so small, you could know everybody, you could, you know, get involved, they knew who you were, you know, it was just, you know, you know, a small little college where, you know, the professors know you, the, you know, everybody knows you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so it felt, you know, you know, you, you do, you know, I did, you know, okay, down there, you know, to start.  So it's like well, why, why change now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have favorite teachers there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The, when I was, when I was there, I did debate, I did college debate.  And I started getting interested in business when I was there.  And the, when I originally went I wanted to be a doctor, that was my ambition was to be a physician.  And even though I was a pretty good student, I wasn't that good in organic chemistry and so as hard as I tried, you know, I just was not that good in organic, I, I just had a mental block on it.  So the, I gravitated more towards business, 'cause I, I liked business, I, I was fascinated with, you know, how people were able to take and build stuff, you know.  And I was, you know, reading about it and listening to people, it sounds, it sounded to me exciting, you know, maybe not to everybody, but it sounded exciting.  So I gravitated more in that direction when I was in, in college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what, what was your major?
Speaker 2: I had a, a major in science and business.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now, where did you, now, you graduated in, in a short period of time right, you, you weren't--
Speaker 2: About three years.
Speaker 1: Three years, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you came out in '69 [1969]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 449122
Speaker 1: Are there any stories about college you wanna (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --that, that, yeah.
Speaker 2: The, well, when I was in college my two best friends were a black guy from Chicago [Illinois] and a white guy from Neenah, Wisconsin, those were my two very best friends.  And the, my friend from Chicago was, was an athlete who played football and knew Chicago so we'd go into Chicago, we'd go into, to hear The Temptations or the, they'd have these shows I think it cost like fifty cent or a dollar or something to go.
Speaker 1: Is that Regal [Regal Theater, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: At the Regal Theater.  So we would go down to the Regal Theater.  And we, we'd go in there and we would, they had a, had a little restaurant there called Gladys' [Gladys' Luncheonette, Chicago, Illinois] on the South Side, we would go there.  And when I went to college, of all the guys who were out at North Central [North Central College, Naperville, Illinois], I think I probably was the only African American guy who wasn't an athlete, there might have been another one but most of the guys who were there were athletes.  And they were very good athletes for that division.  And so I remember when I got there, guys would say well, now what sport do you play?  I said I don't, I don't play any sport.  And so it was, but you, you know, he was a very good friend of mine, you know, still a very good friend of mine.  And then the other guy who was a very good friend of mines was a guy from Neenah who, which is in northern Wisconsin, and he and I became very close friends, roommates, and they, we came roommates in a strange way.  After my first year I was going back for my second year, and I got to the, I got to the registration desk for school and they said well, "We got you signed up for this and this and this and this and where are you staying?"  I said, "What do you mean, I'm saying in the dorm."  Said, "No, no, we don't have a dorm room for you.  So we got you signed up for class but we thought you were staying off-campus this, this semester."  (Laughter) So I'm, you know, I'm down, you know, at college, I know I'm not gone call home and tell 'em, you know, I don't have, you know, I'm coming back home, you know.  And so this guy was standing, I mean, you know, no, as close as we are, and he said, "Well, you can stay with me until a, a room opens up, you know."  So we had like this double room and we set it up for, I don't know, five guys or whatever it was, and so we became, you know, we became friends.  And, in fact, we became roommates for two years, what was gonna be like, okay, wait 'til a room opens up, you know, we became friends for like, very good personal friends.  So, you know, we did a lot of stuff together, and ran for student government together and, you know, probably anything you can think of that friends do in college, the two of us did.  So, I mean, those were two guys who, who I was closest to in high school [Custer High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], in college.  And then there was a, a friend of mine, Weiss [ph.], we weren't married at this time, she was a student too, who was from Gary [Indiana], and she's also a lifetime friend that came out of those college years.
Story_ID: 448728
Speaker 1: You're at North Central [North Central College, Naperville, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, you were talking about some of the students, you were telling me off-camera about one student who was a just absolute genius (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, I--
Speaker 1: --you had never (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) the, I was, the, when I was at North Central, the, we had, I don't know maybe, thirty African American students in the population.  And when I got, when I got there, almost all the guys were athletes.  But when I got to be a, a junior, I was a, a dorm counselor there and there was, when the new freshmen come in, you, you know, they brief you on all of the freshmen.  And the highest ranking academic freshman was this African American guy, just blew the charts off of, you know, standardized tests and everything else so I'm looking for a guy who is a like a bookworm, you know, to walk into the dorm.
Speaker 1: W.E.B. Du Bois or something.
Speaker 2: Right.  And, you know, in walks this guy, you know, with a little goatee, a little, you know, hat sort of, you know, tilted to the side, and I'm trying to, say, well, now, no, you can't be the guy, you know, who, you know, just, you know, devastated all of these numbers.  And I was saying that, you know, the thing that, you know, the thing that registered with, well, you know, he was a brilliant guy, the thing that registered most with me is that, you know, how you assess people shouldn't, you know, should be very careful 'cause a lot of people have a lot of abilities that, you know, you don't see until you really step back and, you know, really, you know, take a different view of it.  And people are, people are trapped by optics, you know, you know, they see a certain thing and they immediately create an association with it.
Speaker 1: So what, what do, do you know what he's doing now or what (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Actually he, he finished, went on to graduate school and he is a counselor for kids in Chicago [Illinois].  And, you know, just a remarkable guy, incredible.  And, you know, when you think of that kind of talent, you know, which is what, which is what I, you know, sort of saw when I was growing up, a lot, you know, a lot of guys, you know, that you see and you bump into they just have incredible talent and it's all about opportunity and access, you know, that's what it all boils down to.  You know, who gives you the opportunity and how do they provide you the access.
Story_ID: 448729
Speaker 1: You graduated [from North Central College, Naperville, Illinois] at '69 [1969]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Right, after three years.  And what, what did you do?  Did you, now, you went on to get a master's, right, from--
Speaker 2: I got a master's degree from the University of Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I finished my prelim for my Ph.D., preliminary exam for the Ph.D. at Wisconsin.  And--
Speaker 1: So what, what, what field were you getting your Ph.D. in?
Speaker 2: Educational policy studies.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And I had two uncles, well, more than that, my oldest brother was in education and he had been through the University of Wisconsin and so he was an educator and I thought well, I wanna be like him.  And my uncles had been in education.  And--
Speaker 1: Well, who, who are, can you name (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, Charles Townsel and Alvin Townsel and Roosevelt Daniels.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Roosevelt is my brother.  And so they had all sort of, really my mother's [Kathryn Townsel Daniels] family had gravitated to education, you know.  And so like when I was in college, you know, my uncles would come down, you know, they would come to Chicago [Illinois] and they might come out and visit me and, you know, they would leave you, you know, a little piece of money when they came out there and I thought, man, education is like the way to go.  So I went to graduate school and I thought I wanted to be sort of like an educational administrator, school superintendent or something like that.  So I finished up my Ph.D. prelims and I got a job offer to go to Mississippi to, there was a school called Saints college [Saints Industrial and Literary School, Lexington, Mississippi] which was the church college of the Church Of God in Christ.  And here, you know, I'm twenty-four, twenty-five year, whatever I was, and so I was gonna go down there and be an assistant dean in the college and write my dissertation on, on education in the South.  And about that same time I met a group of guys from Harvard Law [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]--Harvard School of Education [Harvard Graduate School of Education, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and these guys were talking about changing education for minorities so they were talking about how they could use the legal system to open up opportunities for, for poor people.  Well, I'm thinking I'm, as an educator I had never really, really even thought about it as, you know, a lawyer doing that 'cause I always thought of a lawyer as, you know, someone in the courtroom defending an action or, or counseling someone.  And these were real smart guys.  I mean, these were, these were some of the smartest guys I had ever met.  And they were, came out to Wisconsin and they were working with a guy named Jesse Ray [ph.].  And Jesse Ray was an activist type guy who was very active with the Catholic church.  And what the Catholic church had done was spun off some of its parishes, parish schools, and turned them into community schools.  And Jesse was using that as a model to create education for low income kids and these guys from the Harvard School of Education were interested in developing legal theories for how they could force the state to support these schools.  And they were telling me about all the stuff that they had done, you know, around the country.  This is, I mean, this, I had never, I had never met anybody from Harvard in my life.
Story_ID: 448730
Speaker 1: Who were they?  What were their names?
Speaker 2: The guy who was the lead guy was a guy named Paul Diamond [ph.].  And so they were telling me all this stuff they were doing to, you know, to, to influence education.  So I go down to Saints [Saints Industrial and Literary School, Lexington, Mississippi] and the president of Saints was a woman named Dr. Mallory [Arenia Mallory].  And Dr. Mallory was the classic, strong-willed, get stuff done, commanding personality.  And, and she built the school up and what she had done is, I think it started off in Mississippi to, to educate kids in high school and stuff and she had gotten it, you know, up to a junior college status and she wanted to try to get it beyond that.  So I go down to Mississippi, now, you gotta remember I'm from Wisconsin, you know, I just had finished, you know, at least writing my prelims for my Ph.D. so I'm, I'm thinking I'm, I know a few things.  So I get down there and she says, "Young man, come on in."  So I, I walk into her, her office, and she said, "Well, now, before we start you get on your knees, we're gonna pray."  So, you know, I'm from the church, I'm gone do what this lady says so, so I do it.  And then I spent like a week down there talking to the guy who I would be working with, and I really liked the mission 'cause I thought the mission was great.  But I was, I was still sort of not sort of convinced that was gonna have the kind of change I wanted to see change.  So they offered me the job and I went back home and, you know, and obviously my mother [Kathryn Townsel Daniels], she loved it because, you know, of the affiliation with the church.  And I was thinking about, you know, is this really, really, you know, what I wanna do.  So I applied to Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], I didn't apply to any other law school.  And 'cause really to be honest, I really didn't absolutely know what I really wanted to do.  So I get this letter of acceptance back from Harvard.  And so I call up some people that I knew and I said, "I got accepted, you know, to Harvard," I said.  "You got accepted to Harvard?"  I said, "Yeah," I said, you know, "I, I just met these guys from Harvard and I thought it was exciting."  And they said, "Are you, you know, are you gonna go?"  So I decided to, you know, to not be in education and to go out and not be in education as an administrator but to go out and see if I could, you know, go through law school and write my dissertation at the same time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now were you married at this time?  About this time?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  The, I was going out with the woman I subsequently married but I wasn't married.  So in fact, the year I went to law school we were gonna get married that summer, summer of '71 [1971], and since I was going to law school, I said, "Well, you know, we need to wait a year, you know, let me get out there and figure out, you know, figure out my way through school and then we'll get married after the second year."  My wife [HistoryMaker Irma Daniels] was not real pleased I don't think with that but she was supportive.
Story_ID: 448731
Speaker 1: What was your impression of Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in those, I mean, before you went were you intimidated by the idea of going to Harvard Law School or did you, did, did it really make that much a difference at that point?
Speaker 2: Well, I really wasn't, you know, I, I, I tell you the, I really, I wasn't really, I knew the name, you know, what I'm saying.  I, I knew it was, you know, you know, a prestigious school.  But I wasn't really intimidated by Harvard because at that point I thought academically I could, I, I wasn't worried about handling it academic, I was too dumb to know really, you know, what, what was what.  So I wasn't really, you know, it, it wasn't like I had any apprehension about, you know, about the academic side at all.  But I really didn't, it was out of a frankly, I just didn't know enough to know what I didn't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you're like twenty-two at this point?
Speaker 2: I'm like twenty-three, twenty-four.
Speaker 1: This is like, this is 1972?
Speaker 2: One [1971].
Speaker 1: Seventy-one [1971]?
Speaker 2: Seventy-one [1971].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So my dad [John W. Daniels, Sr.] took me out to, to Harvard and he drive, we're driving out, my dad was very, he was proud of the fact, you know, that I was going to go to Harvard.  I had never been to Boston [Massachusetts] in my life.  So we get into Boston, and Cambridge [Massachusetts] and I'm looking around at this old city and I'm thinking, you know, 'cause, you, you know, if you hadn't been there, you're thinking Harvard, you're gonna see and, you know, we drive by Harvard Square [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and I'm thinking like, you know, so this is what they've been talking about.  So my dad gets me there and he stays a couple of days, you know, and we get all settled in.  And the, I can remember that I really, I really had no appreciation for what lawyers, when I was a kid I used to go down to the courthouse and watch lawyers, but I really didn't have an appreciation for how you learn to be a lawyer.  I just, I didn't have any idea.  And so I go and I register and I'm, and we're standing in line, and a, you know, I'm, you know, I'll never forget this, I'm standing in line, and in back of me is Richard Nixon's [President Richard Milhous Nixon] son-in-law, 'cause he's got security guys--
Speaker 1: That's Rob [sic.], I know that's not--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I know who you're talking about.
Speaker 2: Cox [Edward F. Cox].
Speaker 1: Cox, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yep.  So he's standing in, I mean, you know, you know, he's standing in back of me and they, you know, I can see the security guys, you know, are there.  And, you know, guys are saying, "Do you know who that is," you know.  And in front of me is a guy, who starts talking about well, "I've read all the books twice this summer."  Now, I hadn't even bought my books yet, and this guy is talking about, you know, "I've read all the books twice this summer."  So, I mean, that was the first time, you know, that I sort of had the feeling that, you know, this is gonna be a little different than I thought.
Story_ID: 448732
Speaker 1: Every, you know, every law student when they go to law school, you know, you know, you work like a dog 'cause you don't really know what really it, it's gonna take to do it.  And so we formed, you know, they typically formed these little study groups, you know, of five or six people.  And so I had a couple of study groups.  One study group was with one group of people and then you have a study group it was with another group, so two different study groups.  And one study group was basically minorities and the other one was non-minorities.  I don't, I don't really know how it happened but that was how it sort of got set up.  So the, the first week I'm in, at Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or second week, I bump into a guy and I'm pretty liberal, you know, politically liberal, so, the, I'm, I bump into a guy who is, whose family was from Cuba and the, so we're talking law and somehow it gravitates into politics.  And he starts telling me, you know, about all the problems that liberals have created in the world.  And we became great friends.  This guy, ultimately was, became mayor of one of the Miamis, Miami city [Miami, Florida] or Miami Beach [sic.], a guy named Suarez, Xavier Suarez.  And the, so the first year of law school was pretty much like, you know, just the typical grind.  And my dad [John W. Daniels, Sr.] passed away the first year that I was in law school.  And--
Speaker 2: That was sort of unexpected wasn't it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, very unexpected 'cause he was, you know, fifty years old.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was, and he drove you out there that was pretty (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, right, right.  And so the first year, you know, you get through the first year, you know, you've made it, you know, you know that you can sort of, you know, compete with, you know, the people.
Speaker 2: Now, did that make the first year tougher, you know, your father passing and, and, they, they say, everybody says the first year of law school is really tough?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the, I think, you know, it was, it's for me, the, the first year was tough but I felt like, I felt like after, they have like these trial tests mid-year, and so we had a little trial test and I did okay on that, so I figured, you know, I'm not gone flunk out of here, you know, what I'm saying?  So and then by the end of the first year, you know, I had pretty much, you know, I felt good about that, you know, that I belonged, you know, I didn't know how well I was gonna do, you know, I didn't know if I was gonna be (gestures), you know, but I knew I wasn't gonna be, you know, going back home and saying, you know, you know, you couldn't crack it--
Story_ID: 448733
Speaker 1: So the first year, you know, first year went, you know, pretty well and I got married that summer.  And then my wife [HistoryMaker Irma Daniels] and I moved out to Boston [Massachusetts].  And my wife had taught up in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, which is a small town about sixty miles, fifty or sixty miles from here.  And she had never been to Boston either and she didn't understand, neither one of us understood Boston politics.  And Boston politics are a different breed of politics.  So, I mean, everything, who gets a job here, you know, I mean, that's really, (laughter) it was a different world.  You come from the Midwest you're used to sort of, you know, a reasonably fair system operating, you know.  Yeah, I mean, you feel as though it's reasonably fair.  And Boston, you know, is really very, very political.  So we didn't, you know, we got married in June, we didn't have an apartment, we lucked out, we got an apartment, you know, in student housing out there, one room apartment.  And then maybe, I don't know, maybe a month later she gets sent a letter in the mail, you know, saying she had a teaching job with the Boston public school system.  So she gets out there and they send her over to a place called Charlestown [Boston, Massachusetts], uh-huh.  And Charlestown was sort of an ethnic enclave, and this was like, in the early '70s [1970s] and there was big time school desegregation issues going on in Boston (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And this is South Boston [Boston, Massachusetts], right?
Speaker 1: Near South Boston, yeah [sic.].  And, and so the, I mean, it was really a lot of, so she went over there and she taught middle school.  Now, she had taught middle school the year before in basically an all-white community but in Fond du Lac which is basically like a, a midwestern, you know, community where they didn't have that sort of the clash of social dynamics.  Boston was different, you know, Boston was different.  You know, the, there was a lot of opposition to school integration, a lot of opposition to busing.  And so she taught there for, for a couple of years.  She coached basketball, so the kids liked her.  And hockey, they loved to play street hockey.  And so we stayed, you know, we, we stayed in the student housing for a couple of years as, you know, and we had a lot, you know, all of our friends were in the same boat, one room, you know, (laughter) student housing.  And the, we would all get together, you know, like on the holidays.  This was the first holiday my wife ever missed from her family which she never forgets to tell me about 'cause she thought she was coming home for Christmas, I was studying.  And she was saying, "No, I know, we're going home."  She wasn't even worried about that.  So, you know, probably thirty-four years later I haven't made up for that but, you know, she, you know, really, I mean, she's very close, we're both from very close families.
Story_ID: 448734
Speaker 1: Yeah, I spent two years out there.  I became, you know, president of the Black Law Student Association [Harvard Black Law Students Association] and then that was my first introduction to sort of the mainstream bar association.  I ran for national president, national vice president of the American Bar Association Student Division [American Bar Association Law Student Division] and I was elected.  And that started a lot of what continued really for most of my career involvement with the bar association.  And when I got involved in it, the American Bar Association had a, really a history of, of, of not a very good history with minorities.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the black lawyers had to form their own--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --bar association.
Speaker 1: Right, they did.  And so when I first got involved with it, I think I was like the second African American who was elected nationally to the student division.  And then when I became a young lawyer, I continued to be involved.  And a guy who was sort of like the mentor to all of us at that time, was a guy who subsequently became mayor of Detroit [Michigan], Dennis Archer.  And so Archer was like, you know, he, he may have been like four or five years older than me but for all the guys my age and younger, he was like the, the pioneer, you know.
Speaker 2: That's, that's for the American Bar Association?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he became the first African, I think the first African American president of the American Bar Association.  You know, mayor of Detroit, Michigan Supreme Court, a remarkable guy, very remarkable guy.
Story_ID: 448735
Speaker 1: Was Derrick Bell [HistoryMaker Derrick A. Bell, Jr.] there when you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Derrick Bell was there.  And, in fact, I wrote my third year paper with Derrick Bell.  And Derrick was admired by everybody at Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] because he was one of those guys who didn't mind personal sacrifice for his, for his principles, you know.  I mean, he, I mean, and even then, you know, Derrick didn't mind.  There were really two guys who were there.  Derrick was the academic guy, well, three, there were three guys, Derrick was the academic guy, a professor Harvard.  Then there was a guy who, named Bob Washington [ph.] who was, Bob was sort of a protege of Pat Harris [Patricia Roberts Harris] who had been the secretary of housing and urban development.  And Bob subsequently went on to be a partner at a major firm and did a whole lot of other stuff out in D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  And there, the other guy who was sort of in my opinion transformed Harvard Law School for minorities was a guy named Walter Leonard [HistoryMaker Walter J. Leonard].  And Walter Leonard was a special assistant to both the president of Harvard Law School and the president of Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And he was the guy who was like your, he was the guy who made you feel confident that you belonged there.  And meaning, if you talked to, now, I was at Harvard in the, the mid-'70s [1970s] and, you know, I was there with, you know, several guys when went on, you know, to be involved in business and government and law and politics.  And I think if you speak to just about all of those guys, you know, they'll tell you the same thing that, you know, Walter Leonard was, he was really the guy who sort of gave you sort of like, you know, the boost you needed to, to make you feel like, you know, you can do it.  And then, you know, he was a guy who was, you know, also down to earth.  So I remember when my grandmother came to my graduation at Harvard, and, you know, he would go over and he would, you know, say well, you know, your grandson did a great job, you know.  And, I mean, he was just that kind of guy, you know.  And, I mean, God only knows how many people who, you know, he personally affected during the time I was at Harvard.  So I, I mean I had a good experience at Harvard.  The, I always thought that having gone there was, was good for me because it made me very confident that I could sort of deal with just about, I, I was never afraid I was gonna get sort of out thought on anything.  I'm not saying I'm the smartest guy in the world but I wasn't, I never went into a room thinking, you know, some guy is gonna, you know, intellectually blow me away.
Story_ID: 448736
Speaker 1: What about Charles Ferguson [ph.], was he there at that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ferguson was there one year when I was there.  But I think Ferguson came, I think Ferguson came either my second or third year.  But Derrick [HistoryMaker Derrick A. Bell, Jr.] was clearly, I forget what year Derrick came.  And Derrick was relatively young when he, when I was there.  I mean, I say young now I don't remember.  And so he was, you know, man, there were lots of, when I first went there, the, when I became president of the Black Law Student Association [Harvard Black Law Students Association] at Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] the, the, the first sort of inkling I had of sort of what you might do was, I was, I think I might have been a first year when Reggie Lewis [Reginald F. Lewis] came to campus.  And Reggie came to campus and, you know, Reggie was like a legend almost at that point.  And the, in fact, it was sort of funny, you know, probably, you know, five or six years later, maybe, no, maybe, six or seven years later, when I became a lawyer, I had a big, I had a client and I was on the other side of a deal from Reggie.  And, you know, Reggie was one of these guys who, you know, he, he was very certain of his abilities, which were enormous.  And I was calling him up to negotiate something and here I'm thinking, you know, in the old days we're all looking up, you know, to Reggie and now, you know, I'm negotiating, you know, with him.  And so I took a position on something, I don't even remember what it was, and, you know, he said, "Now, John [HistoryMaker John W. Daniels, Jr.], you know, I wrote that document."  I said, "Yeah, Reggie, I know you wrote it but this is what it means."  And so the, in fact, it was sort of funny the, that really was, that deal was sort of what got me started on, on the business side of, of the practice of law.
Story_ID: 448737
Speaker 1: Any other stories about Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] before we--
Speaker 2: Well, I had a lot, I mean, I mean, the, the, the greatest, you know, for me, the greatest thing about that experience was a, a lot of, a lot of people that, you know, I met there, you know, are still friends, you know, you know, thirty something years later.  The, and, the, and I think the, it was also, it also to me was sort of the place where I came away thinking that you can really make a difference, you know, that, I mean, that that was, I think, that was the, I, I, you know, I really came out thinking that, you know, not that I necessarily would but that, you know, if you really sort of, you know, are passionate about something, you know, that you can really make a difference.  And so that was, you know, that was what I left there with. I, you know, I mean, I left, my wife [HistoryMaker Irma Daniels] and I left Cambridge [Massachusetts] in 1974.  And well, actually, this, this is actually before I graduated the, the, at Harvard you always think that everybody at Harvard immediately is embraced by, you know, all of the best opportunities in the world, that's not necessarily true.  The, when I was a student at Harvard with the African American people who were in the class, you know, at that point the thing was to go to Wall Street, that was sort of like, you know, the thing, you know, at Harvard.  And so everybody wanted to get these jobs on Wall Street.  And I wasn't really that, you know, pumped about going to Wall Street.  And so but still if you're there it's sort of part of, you know, you know, what you take on.  And so I watched a lot of my friends go through sort of the desire to see that happen.  And, you know, this is the mid-'70s [1970s] and, you know, recruiting was a lot different.
Story_ID: 448738
Speaker 1: I remember when I came out of school in '74 [1974] the, there was a real push 'cause law firms really had, big law firms had not really had a long history of having African American lawyers in those firms.  So I came out, when I was recruited in 1973, I had done pretty well at Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and so I was being recruited by law firms and they, it was sort of one of the most interesting times at least in my career because you the, you'd go to a city like Richmond, Virginia, 'cause I wanted to go to, I did not wanna go to Wall Street, I wanted to either go to Atlanta [Georgia] or Richmond or Indianapolis [Indiana] or Milwaukee [Wisconsin] or Chicago [Illinois], I did not wanna go, I just didn't want the lifestyle of New York [New York].  And the, so I was being recruited by these firms, and the, you would go to this city and they, and they were trying to sort of assess how you would perform in these law firms.  And when I was being recruited I think every law firm that I was recruited to with the exception of one in Atlanta, they really didn't have any African American lawyers.  And I don't think any of 'em had any African American partners that I, the firms I was looking at, and these were good firms.  And I remember going to Richmond and Richmond had some great firms.  And the, there was a guy down there who really wanted to integrate the Richmond law firms and he was from Harvard.  And so he came up to Harvard and, you know, he sat down and he said, you know, "I want you to come down there."  And so I get down there, I go down to Richmond and the law firm was clearly an excellent law firm, excellent people.  And then they want to sort of feel me out, see what kind of guy I was, you know, would I, you know, would I pass the Jackie Robinson test, I mean, that's what I call it, you know, you know, would I, you know, would I have enough tolerance to take, you know, what I might have to deal with.  And, you know, (laughter) I needed a job so the, I knew that wasn't a particular issue.
Story_ID: 448739
Speaker 1: The last part of the interview after all of this stuff they take me out to a guy who had been a judge, a supreme court judge in Virginia [Supreme Court of Virginia].  And, I mean, this is like classic, right out of a movie screen, I'm going out to this big house with the pillars, you know, and, you know, he takes me into the, his study and he's the last guy, you know, that's gotta, I guess, you know, bless it, you know, this guy is the one we, you know, are gonna go with.  And it was sort of funny because the, there was another guy who was at Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut] who I never met, who was an African American guy, who was from Richmond [Virginia], and they kept talking about this guy in counterpoint, you know, "We know So and So, he's from here but, you know, we want, you know, we think you would, you know, fit in with this environment."  And I, I never knew what they were really trying to say.  Well, I subsequently found out what they were really trying to say was that they felt more comfortable that I would, you know, fit in with sort of their law firm culture at that point in history.  And so I go out to this place with the supreme, and he, you know, he sits me down and he talks to me and, you know, he sort of, you know, is a very southern gentleman so, you know, all the questions were very sort of, at least to me appeared to be sort of like, you know, non-threatening in any way.  So I finish up and the guy calls me and he said, well, you know, "Judge so and so loves you, you know, we want you to come on down."  And so we go back to Boston [Massachusetts], my wife [HistoryMaker Irma Daniels] and I.  And my wife was from Wisconsin so she wanted to come home, I mean, she, she said I'll go wherever but she really wanted to come home.  So we're sitting down and we, well, I said, well, you know, I'm trying to figure out which, where we're gonna go.  And so we get it down to like two law firms, this firm [Quarles and Brady LLP], that I ultimately came to, and another firm, one of which was in Richmond.  So they said well, why don't you come on back up here and let us show you around.  So I go back up and they invite a guy in who was, I think this guy was like either the black deputy mayor or mayor of Richmond and so they invite this guy and some, you know, obviously some African American leaders and some non and, you know, really they, you know, went, you know, beyond what was typical to recruit, you know, like a first year law student.  And so we're, you know, we go back to the hotel we say, "Well, we, we, you know, we're gonna, we're gonna think about this place," we really, so we're debating back and forth but, "I know my wife wants to come here but this firm is really a terrific firm."  So we get ready to leave Richmond and we go to the airport and at that point my wife had an Afro and so and this is before, it, it must have been before the kind of security that we have right now.  And she had this pick (gesture) and the guy says to her, "You can't have that or--," I mean, I, I forgot what the words were, and this was nothing to do with the law firm, you know, but I thought, you know, I'm not coming, you know, I'm not coming--
Speaker 2: This is a guy from the firm that says this or--
Speaker 1: No, no, no.  This was--
Speaker 2: --a guy, this guy at the airport?
Speaker 1: --this is a guy at the airport, you know.  No, no, no, the guy at the firm was great.  But I thought okay, you know--
Speaker 2: The social milieu around you was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I thought, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah, I could handle all the rest of it but, you know, you know, if, because the firm will be great but you still gotta live in the community, you know.
Story_ID: 448740
Speaker 1: That was really how we got to Milwaukee [Wisconsin], you know, so we decided to come to this, you know, to Quarles and Brady [Quarles and Brady LLP].  It was, you know, people were very nice, there was a guy here who was, who had spotted me as a first year law student and had kept his eye on me.  And he had been, he's now the president of the Medical College of Wisconsin [Milwaukee, Wisconsin], I was on his board of trustees.
Speaker 2: Oh, and what's his name, his--
Speaker 1: Mike Bolger [T. Michael Bolger].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so he had, you know, when I was a first year student, I mean, he had told me well, you know, "If you really wanna come back to Milwaukee, you know, we'd love to have you."  And so, you know, he stayed in contact with me and, you know, I liked the people here because I felt comfortable with them.  And that was, you know, that was important.
Speaker 2: So is Bolger spelled like Ray Bolger?
Speaker 1: B-O-L-G-E-R.
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: All right.  And that's, that's something.  And you've been here ever since?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, and this is really rare, I mean, I know, I know, I've never heard of that, you know--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --I've, I've interviewed a lot of people--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but hardly anybody stays at the same law firm--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --this, this long.  And so what was it, I mean, so it must have been a good fit I guess, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well--
Speaker 2: I guess?
Speaker 1: --the, the, I came to, I came to the firm and the, the key thing for me was I wanted to feel comfortable in the environment.  But I knew I could do the work, there was, you know, I, I wasn't, I was never worried about that part.  But I wanted to feel comfortable and supported and the guys made me feel that way.  And, and I knew I was going to a big law firm, you know, I had no illusions about that part.  I, you know, and I know all of the, you know, financial pressures and business pressures so and that was what I wanted, I wanted that experience at, when I first came I wanted to get it because I wanted to learn how to be lawyer and then I thought I would go out and form my own firm.  So I, I came into the firm and, the, started off as a labor lawyer, initially.  And that was, that was fine because I liked, you know, sort of the fact of, you know, litigating, winning for the client, et cetera.  But then I, I really gravitated towards, early in my career, towards real estate because I liked making deals.  And so I became a, a real estate lawyer in the firm and I got to work on, you know, significant projects.  And what it allowed me to do was to get beyond Milwaukee.  So very early on I started, I kept being involved in the American Bar Association, I got elected to the American College of Real Estate Lawyers which was the preeminent group of real estate lawyers in the country.  And then some of the guys in the American College of Real Estate Lawyers sort of took me under their wing.  And, you know, these were lawyers from the East Coast and big firms and they took me under their wings and sort of, you know, opened doors for me to show what I can do with big clients and that, you know, that was what sort of, you know, really in a sense helped, you know, helped propel my career.
Story_ID: 448741
Speaker 1: What were some of the big deals that you worked on?
Speaker 2: I worked on the redevelopment of downtown St. Louis [Missouri].  Worked on the redevelopment of downtown Milwaukee [Wisconsin], worked on, you know, football stadiums, baseball stadiums.
Speaker 1: Well, it's good to name 'em, so this is--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --history so let's--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I worked on the Milwaukee Bradley Center stadium facility [BMO Harris Bradley Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  I worked on the, what they call a waterfront in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] project.  I worked on projects in California that involved some sports facilities.  Worked on a lot of major office building developments in the Midwest principally, Wisconsin, Chicago [Illinois], some in Texas.  And I, you know, I also worked with some European investors, you know, who were involved in acquisition of shopping centers around, big galleria type, major malls, shopping centers and that kind of thing.  So that, you know, but, you know, and that, it helped me to be hooked up with these guys outside of Wisconsin 'cause Wisconsin is not a big real estate market, you know, you don't think of real estate when you think of Wisconsin, you think New York [New York], San Francisco [California], so these guys sort of brought me into the loop, you know, so that helped greatly in, in establishing my credentials as a, as a real estate lawyer.
Story_ID: 448742
Speaker 1: Brady and Quarles [sic. Quarles and Brady LLP] is a, it's a large firm, right, it's a pretty big--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --is it--
Speaker 2: It's a huge firm.  I don't know about huge--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --it's not huge by, I mean, it's a, it is, you know, one of the top, you know, 200 firms in the country.  And, you know, law firms have gotten so big now but, you know, we have, you know, 460 lawyers, you know, in our firm, you know, in several states so it's a big national corporate law firm.  But when you go to New York [New York], you know, you know, you, you step up, (laughter) you know, another level in terms of, you know, lots of things, New York, L.A. [Los Angeles, California], you know, places like that.  Because, you know, law firms are really a reflection of, in, in part finances and so, you know, you, where the money center, you know, are, that is really, you know, where the premier law firms are.  Firms that people all around the world, I mean, you know, will, would know.
Story_ID: 448743
Speaker 1: So these guys, you know, sort of helped me, and then I became the national president of the American College of Real Estate Lawyers.  And--
Speaker 2: About what year is this?  This is--
Speaker 1: Oh, boy.  That's gotta be maybe six or seven years ago.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, somewhere in that vintage.
Speaker 2: So around 2000 or so--
Speaker 1: Yeah, somewhere--
Speaker 2: --or 2001?
Speaker 1: --some, yeah, somewhere in that time period.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: See when I started practicing law I became a partner in 1981, I think, at Quarles [Quarles and Brady LLP].  And in 19--around 1990, I became a member of the executive committee of the firm, and then in 2007 I became the chairman of Quarles which is the person who is, you know, person responsible for the organization.  So that was the, they tell me I don't know, but they tell me that's the only African American lawyer in the country who's ever had that role in one of the top two hundred law firms.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, that is a significant thing.  I've, I've been told that being the, the managing partner is like being a chair of a department of a college or something in a sense the way it works or maybe you can explain it better, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, the, I, the way our firm works now and the way most law firms work, I think the chairman of our firm which is what I am, is more like the CEO of a corporation, that, you know, that that's how, you know, that's how we would align it.  And then what we have is a guy who is similar to a chief operating officer, you know, who runs sort of the internal stuff, would be the managing partner who, you know, but the chairman of the firm is, you know, or one way of thinking about it is the CEO of the enterprise.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, do you enjoy this role (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, the, I enjoy it but it is, it's a, it's an unusual situation because the, I mean, law firms are, are, are basically business enterprises that have the overlay of a professional organization.  So you're dealing with a lot of motivation of people, constant motivation of people.  And the, the really good CEO types create a vision and get people motivated into sort of the business plan of the organization.  And it is a, it's a role that requires that, that you have the confidence of your partners because that's what you're dealing with, you're dealing with creating confidence and vision and strategy and so I enjoy that part of it quite a bit.  The, that part of it that is, that part of it that involves sort of what social mission they put on any guy who's the first in something that's a little different.  I'm more a private person so that part of it is a little, that's a learning experience for me.  The, and I've, I've had enough friends who have been through, you know, situations like this in other arenas, to, to understand that, you know, it's, it's a mixed blessing.  So you have to, you know, you have to be very aware of, you know, how it not only affects you but how it affects your, your family.  And so that, you know, I'm learning that part, that part I'm, you know, that part I'm learning.  So it's not so much the, the business part of it, that's easy.

Speaker 1: A guy come to my office when I first got appointed [as chairman of Quarles and Brady LLP] and he, this guy was a very, I know he, I knew him as a teacher as a kid, and very well respected African American guy in this community [Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  And, I mean, just, you know, sort of, you know, people grow up admiring guys like this.  And he came up to my office and he said, he said, "You know, John [HistoryMaker John W. Daniels, Jr.]," he said, he said, "when I was a kid, my dad worked here at Quarles and Brady as the elevator operator."  And he said, you know, he would take these guys up and down the elevator and he said, he, he, this guy's dad, always wanted his son to be a lawyer and he said, you know, "I never, you know, was able to do that."  And he said, "I just wanted to tell you that story and I'm happy to see you, you know, taking on that role."  So, I mean, I guess it depends on, on how affected you are about, you know, what it means, you know, in terms of, you know, nobody's, everybody's got lots of faults, you know, that's life.  You know, what I'm saying?  And so, you know, you're trying to, you're trying to live up to something that other people, you know, view in, in, in a different world.  So, you know, that part of it is, is, is different.  I think, you know, I've, I've spoken to enough guys who, who have done things like that to know that, you know, if people are really sort of candid about it, you know, everybody's who's been in that kind of spot, you know, understands that there's a little, there's a little more pressure on it.  And so, you know, that part you have to, I think you have to adjust, you have to mature into.  And so, you know, that's, you know, that's what I'll do.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Is this where you draw on your upbringing and how you were raised?
Speaker 1: I think so, I think so because the, I mean, I feel as though, in a, in a sense, I, I know that I understand fundamentally you have to treat people fairly, I mean, that's sort of ingrained.  And I know that trust is a function of people believing you're gonna treat 'em fairly, you know.  They give you a break if they know, you know, that yeah, that you're a trustworthy guy, that you're not a, you know, you know, they can trust what you say, they can believe what you say and they can believe that you're motivated by, you know, the right things.  Now, they may not agree with everything you do but, you know, sort of, you know, that feeling that yeah, yeah, I can trust this guy, you know, he's, he's got my interests, you know, at heart.  That is where, you know, nothing I learned in law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] taught me that, that's more what I learned, you know, from my, from my upbringing.  So, you know, I think that, you know, even though I didn't know it when I was a kid, I think, you know, that is probably one of the strongest things that I think you have to have, you have to have trust and confidence in people.

Speaker 1: What's your philosophy of, I guess, your legal philosophy?
Speaker 2: Well, my, my, my approach to law is that, I like to see stuff, I like to make things happen, you know, that that's really, you know, what I mean, my, my desire as a lawyer is to be part of making things happen, whether it's business or civic or community, to use the law to make things happen.  You know, I'm not a, I'm not a guy who sits up and, you know, and gets enthralled by the latest legal journal, you know, I mean, that doesn't, you know, some guys love, you know, sort of the written word of the law.  And, I mean, that, that, you know, I mean, I know it, I understand it, you know, I appreciate it's importance but, you know, what's more significant to me is, okay, what can I do with that for people or, you know, well, what can I do with that, with my clients.  And so that's, you know, so, I, I get, you know, my greatest satisfaction from doing stuff that is creative and that I can say I had a hand in it.  You know, the client is the one who does it but I had a hand in shaping it.  So if, you know, in business, if I, you know, can help, you know, people do things that they wanna do in business, that is personally satisfying to me.  And I've had enough experience with that, you know, historically over, you know, thirty-some years in the practice of law, that, you know, I know that that's what's sort of, you know, I feed on.
Story_ID: 448746
Speaker 1: Now, I read that you've been able to, you get some satisfaction out of being able to, to use your position and your skills to help the community.  You know, we, we often hear of civil rights lawyers being able to do that but--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --how do you do it from a position of a real estate lawyer?
Speaker 2: I, well, from my perspective, I think, I'm probably as much a business man as a lawyer, you know.  And so what I'm always fascinated by are creating other opportunities.  So the, when you see, like what, I never did this but when you see what Reggie Lewis [Reginald F. Lewis] did, it took sort of opportunities for people of color to another level.  I mean--
Speaker 1: And he was like CEO of Kraft [Kraft Foods Group, Inc.] right or (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, he, Beatrice [Beatrice Foods TLC; Beatrice International Foods].
Speaker 1: Beatrice, right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Beatrice, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you do a, you do a billion dollar deal, you know, at that time in history, you know, all over the world with international things, it has impact.  Well, for me the, to see developers have minorities involved in all aspects of the project, you know, on major projects, or if I see people building companies for example, one of the people I was associated with was a person who did the largest, at that time, sale from a non-minority company to a non, to a majority company.  And just to see that unfold and to participate in it, and obviously in the family business I'm involved in, you know, that, you know, to take that from, you know, nothing which my sister [Valerie Daniels-Carter] did, I just went along for the ride, you know, but take it from basically nothing to, you know, one of the larger, you know, black enterprise companies, I mean, that's satisfying, you know.  It's not a mega company but it's, it's nice.

Speaker 1: Try and repeat some of what you said--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --about Mike Bolger [T. Michael Bolger] and your relationship with him and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Mike was the guy who recruited me to the firm [Quarles and Brady LLP].  Mike was, you know, he was in the priesthood I think before he came and then he switched out of that to become an attorney.  And he was, you know, a guy who was, civically active in everything, you know, he, one of the big real estate projects here when he was a young lawyer, he helped get it started with the theater district.  And he was a guy who, you know, would, you know, tell you, you can do this, you can do this, you know.  So when he became president of the Medical College [Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] I went on his board, or if a foundation was set up he would, you know, encourage, you know, my appointment.  And what I was saying was that my experience is that everybody needs a few guys that they can really talk to, who don't have any agenda but to give them, you know, good advice, 'cause you need it because, I mean, there, there, there are things where you get to a fork in the road and, you know, it can have large consequences how you decide it and you need at the, at some of those points to be able to really, you know, have people to process through, you know, sort of what you're thinking and the directions you're gonna take, your career, your life, or, you know, whatever.
Story_ID: 448748
Speaker 1: Tell me about the, the, the food business.  Now, you, you all have what's been described as a little dynasty going here in Milwaukee [Wisconsin], the Daniels, you and your sister  got involved in a project with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My sister, yeah, my sister and I got involved in the food business.  And my sister is, she is the business person, she really runs it, the operation [V and J Holding Companies, Inc.].
Speaker 1: Now, what's your sister's name for the record?
Speaker 2: Valerie [Valerie Daniels-Carter].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she, Valerie was, I mean, she came out of college and she went to work for a bank for a couple of years and then worked for another financial institution for another couple of years so by the time she was, I don't know 25, she just, 25, 26, somewhere in there, she decided to go into the food business.  And so this was 1984, '83 [1983], somewhere in that area.  And this was when Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] was very active in pursuing opportunities for minorities in various business areas.  And so she always wanted to, to own a business.  So she started looking around for businesses, applied, you know, to be a franchisee, saved up a little money.  She and I put in a, you know, a few thousand dollars apiece and decided to, you know, go for it.  So we bought, you know, built and bought, you know, a fast food, Burger King restaurant.  And then we decided that, you know, we could really do that with multiple units of, of businesses so we started building and buying, you know, restaurants and then we bought, you know, a market in Detroit [Michigan] and then we bought, you know, a market in Ohio and--
Speaker 1: Now, these are food markets or complete, I mean--
Speaker 2: These are Burger Kings, Pizza Huts--
Speaker 1: Burger Kings, okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, and so we would buy 'em.  We would buy 'em, build 'em, and, and run 'em.  And, you know, after a while it, you know, turned into a, you know, you know, a sizable operation for that kind of, for that kind of business, but she did it all.  I mean--
Speaker 1: How many do you--
Speaker 2: It's over a hundred.
Speaker 1: Over a hundred.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's over a hundred.
Speaker 1: Are they are all Burger Kings or--
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  Burger King, Pizza Huts, Auntie Anne's, which is a pretzel company.  She's now getting into Haagen-Dazs which is ice cream.  Any brand, any food brand, you know, major food brand we'll take a look at.  And it's all, the company is family owned, so the, she and I own it together, she runs it, I work on business strategy, I'm the chairman of the board, my mom [Kathryn Townsel Daniels] was on our board of trustees.  So, you know, it was, you know, more of an honorary thing.  So my mother would say, you know, "When are the board meetings," 'cause she knew that was when the board fee would come.  And so, you know, and then when my mother passed my brother [HistoryMaker Bishop Sedgwick Daniels] came on the board, the bishop.  And so it's been a family operation from the very beginning.  And the thing I think that we're most proud of is that the, our company is, has integrated talent.  So, you know, we have blacks, whites, Hispanics, all through our operation.  And, you know, our, our president now is an African American male guy, you know, one of the few in the country in an operation like that, who's been great for us, I mean, a marvelous guy, you know.  And, I mean--
Speaker 1: And what's his name?
Speaker 2: John Draper.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it, you know, and, and in a business like that where they claim that, you know, they can't find guys who can have that kind of talent, you know, you know, we've been fortunate enough to find guys who are very loyal to what we're trying to do.
Story_ID: 448749
Speaker 1: We treat it as a family operation that, you know, the people that we bring in, you know, it's not just a job, you know, we want them to feel as though we're interested in what they're interested in, just like, you know, we have, you know, challenges and everything else we know they do too and, you know, that's, we want people to know that, you know, we have that kind of personal commitment to you.  So that really is Valerie [Valerie Daniels-Carter], I mean, she, I can, I can take no credit, I mean, I'm probably, you know, a deal maker but in terms of growing it and running it and, you know, doing everything associated with it, you know, she, you know, she did it, and I mean she did it through, and her husband [Jeffrey Alan Carter, Sr.] was killed in an industrial accident about eight or nine years ago and she still just, you know, recovered, you know, at, through that and just, you know, kept running it.  So, I mean, she's like my mom [Kathryn Townsel Daniels], I mean, she's like, you know, you know, (laughter) she never stops, I mean, she's focused.
Speaker 2: Now, has any, any of your mother's altruism like that, that, that type of spirit like--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: --come through the--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: --your restaurant business [V and J Holding Companies, Inc.]?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  I mean, we give a lot of scholarships and, you know, that kind of stuff, return to the community.  I think all of us have, you know, have, have interest in altruism, I mean, and, and in different ways.  For example, the, my brother [HistoryMaker Bishop Sedgwick Daniels] probably, you know, food pantries and housing and all the rest of that stuff.  Yeah, I've been more interested, I've been more involved in sort of trying to get mainstream organizations to be responsive to the entire community.  And then, you know, on a personal level, I, you know, I started like a golf tournament [Fellowship Open] that became the biggest golf tournament in our, in our community to give money back to organizations that are not sort of your big name organizations, that are helping kids.
Story_ID: 448750
Speaker 1: What's the name of your tournament?
Speaker 2: The Fellowship Open.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we've been doing that for, you know, seven or eight years.  And, you know, the great part about it is that you see these organizations and you find these people who are doing all this stuff with kids, with so little money.  So it's not like we raise, you know, you know, enormous amounts of money but, you know, over the, over the years $700,000 of money and you see these groups and they're doing, I mean, they're doing stuff with these kids (laughter) it's unbelievable.  And, and you, you look around and you think, boy, you know, why isn't more being given to these groups that really are having an impact on kids.  I mean, a real, you know, direct personal impact on kids.  So that's been very rewarding.  And, you know, the thing about it is, you know, I have, you know, friends from all over the country, you know, who come in now.  It's almost like a family type, I mean, event.  So the, like I'm, I'm involved with a group of guys, one of my clients who is a business guy, had a great idea for a business product, he didn't, it wasn't successful but he had a great idea.  It was, called Brown Sugar [ph.], and it was baby products marketed to an ethnic market.  And he was just before his time.  And so several years ago he formed a group of guys from all different backgrounds, you know, truck driver, lawyer, brain surgeon, you know, all, I mean, you, you would never, if you put this group of fifteen guys in a room and you said what is common with them, you'll say, "I don't see it."  And but what was common with the group is that these guys are all, they're very committed to their religious views.  So he, for years he tried to get me to come, I said, "No, I'm not coming, Dennis, I'm not, I'm not coming, I'm not ready to come."  And--
Speaker 1: What's his name (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Dennis Smith [ph.].
Speaker 1: Dennis Smith, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so finally he said, "You gotta, you know, you gotta come."  So I went to one of the meetings and great time and, you know, I mean, just guys who was talking about, you know, challenges with men, and it was really terrific.  So all those guys would come to the tournament, you know, guys who we met in the business community, in the franchise, bankers, guys from all over the country come, you know, business network guys come, and we just make a weekend of the whole golf tournament but the focus of it is for the community to see African American guys giving something to youngsters.  And we don't just do a golf tournament and, you know, give away the money, we have the kids come out there, they spend the day, we have seminars and it's a very, probably one of the, the most socially rewarding things for me personally.
Story_ID: 448751
Speaker 1: Now, you're on a, some mind-boggling list, list of boards--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know.  Well, what, what are some of your favorite boards?  I mean, I don't mean mention--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --all of 'em but--
Speaker 2: Well, I'm very interested in business so the, I've been chairman of a minority bank board, North Milwaukee [North Milwaukee State Bank, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and we took that bank from a, a level of, to its maximum level of profitability as chairman of the board.  I'm also on the board of a, a bank called Marshall and Ilsley [Marshall and Ilsley Corporation] which is about a 50 billion [dollar] plus bank, one of the better banks in the country.  I've been on the board obviously of other companies, technology companies, automobile companies, Get in Technology [ph.], and companies like that.  And then I've been involved a lot with civic boards, Greater Milwaukee Foundation [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] which is probably, I don't know, maybe half a billion dollars in assets, Evinrude Foundation [Ralph Evinrude Foundation, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  And, you know, my goal is to make sure that those organizations as they're looking at their mission, make sure that they, you know, include the entire community and, you know, I'm very clear about, you know, that, you know, that's, you know, important.  And I think, you know, the, I've been fortunate that a lot of people who are associated with, with those things, you know, have accepted that, you know, (unclear) you know, that's something that he believes in.  And I'm, you know, I'm not, you know, you know, I'm not shy about saying it, you know, that I think, you know, in order for, for this community to change you gotta include more people.  You gotta include more people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I, I saw you were on the board of Ko-Thi Dance Company too, so--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --cultural--
Speaker 2: I'm not anymore but I was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Ferne Caulker [HistoryMaker Ferne Yangyeitie Caulker], who is a marvelous person, who started Ko-Thi, I don't know, thirty-five years ago, forty year, whatever it was, she and I were in high school [Custer High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] together.  And Ferne, Ferne is from Sierra Leone and, I mean, it's a great dance company.  And, I mean, you talk about, here is a woman for all of these years sustained that.  You know, you know, and she just, you know, it's a passion, it's a love.  So, you know, I've been involved with it and did a little fundraising for 'em but, I mean, she's done, you know, she's done an enormous job with Ko-Thi, she really has.
Story_ID: 448752
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Well, I'll tell you the, my, I'll tell you a story and it may express, you know, in part, the hopes and concerns.  Three years ago I was at a, I was at an event, my family, my brother [HistoryMaker Bishop Sedgwick Daniels], the minister, his church is right in the neighborhood that we grew up with and it was a neighborhood that over years transitioned and ran into tough and difficult times.  And when he decided to build a church [Holy Redeemer Institutional Church of God in Christ, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] he said that's where he wanted to be.  Well, I, I don't even know if I totally agree with, you know, that but that was his mission and his calling.  So, you know, we all pitched in and helped.  And the, they had a boys and girls club that is associated with the campus, the schools which was actually called the Daniels-Mardak Boys Club [Daniels-Mardak Boys and Girls Club, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and they named it for me and for a guy who's the CEO of a music publishing company, Keith Mardak.  And it has been one of the faster growing boys clubs, if not the fastest in the state.  And so the, we wanted to, I, I love sports so I wanted to, I wanted to hook up academics and sports.  And for years in this community, in our community, the Catholic church has had a basketball tournament for middle school kids from Catholic schools, and it's a big deal, kids, you know, look forward to it every year.  And so I was talking to our director of our center called the Mother Kathryn Daniels Center [Mother Kathryn Daniels Conference Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], I said, well, you know, "We need to have one of these for central city kids, you know, we need to have a tournament that kids come to, first class, you know, they really get pumped up, you know, and we'll have a, an African American, a noteworthy African American athlete slash businessman every year that these kids can see and we'll mount their jersey up, you know, on the wall during the final tournament."  And so that was my vision to have this thing, academics and athletics.  So I convinced some guys to kick in a little money to get it started.  And I wanted it to be like, you know, the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] for middle school kids on athletics and academics.  And we got it started, the first year it was a great success, second year it was a terrific success, and the, on the academics and on the athletic side.  More on the athletic initially but it came along.  So I, you know, but it, it goes over a couple of weekends, it's sixty-four teams, and the kids really love it 'cause, I mean, kids who don't have, the only thing they see is what's on TV or what's in their neighborhood, they have no idea of some of the other opportunities they can have in life.  So we really wanted to, to use it to promote what they, you know, what they could do.  So we did it and the kids loved it, they bought into it, you know, both the academics and the athletics.  And I was really proud of what we had created.  And I went to one of the tournament games and there was a kid and his team lost and, you know, kids are kids when they're in middle school, they lost and obviously he's disappointed.  And the, the routine was the kids after the games come up and shake each other's hand, part of teaching, you know, sportsmanship and life skills and all the rest of that.  And this kid wouldn't do it.
Story_ID: 448753
Speaker 1: So I was watching his coach, and I was thinking now when I was a kid, if I didn't do that my coach would say, "You get over there and shake the other team's hand."  So, you know, I'm a businessman and then they see me in the newspaper, you know, or on TV, you know, some of the adults, so they sort of know who I am.  So I walk up to the coach and I said, "You need to tell that kid to shake hands, I mean, that's part of what he needs to learn."  And so the coach says he says, he says, "If you wanna tell him, you tell him."  He says, "I'm not telling him."  So I walked down to the kid, and this kid is seventh or eighth grade and, you know, here I am sort of like in my own little world every day, so when I say something generally people are gonna respond, you know, and most of the time their response is gonna be positive.  So I walk up to the kid and I say, you know, "Good game, you played well," and I'm thinking back to my childhood, man, I'm thinking back to guys that I respected and I'm thinking I'm about ready to communicate to this kid the same kind of thing that someone may have communicated to me many years ago.  And so I tell him he did a good job, et cetera, et cetera, I said, "But you really do need to go up there and shake the other team's hand."  The guy turns, the kid turns to me and said, "Dog, don't you talk to me like, I'm not doing," and then he just went off in a barrage.  (Laughter) And I was, really I was like, when it first came out I couldn't even really get ready for it to be honest with you because it was like I couldn't imagine this kid was set, I couldn't imagine anybody saying it to me and I especially couldn't imagine this  twelve year-old kid or, whatever he was.  So it really had like a, it had a profound impact on me because it, it told me that sort of the value set that I grew up with is not adhered to sort of as strongly.  Because in the old days even the worst kid on the playground, the coach or whoever would have said something to you.  I mean, I remember the worst kid when I was growing up, man, I mean, you know, it's not like, I mean, I grew up with guys, you know, you know, I know, you know, I remember, you know, all of the things when I was growing up.  But when you were growing up, when I was growing up if, you know, Mr. Provine [ph.] came out and said, you know, that "You go shake, you know, So and So's hand," you know, that kid's gone go shake So and So, he now, he might have cursed him out afterwards, after Mr. Provine was gone.  So what my biggest concern is, is a values concern.  And the, and I think it comes across as a little too preachy in a sense but I think that, I think the values piece is more important than, than people really appreciate.  And part of it is, it's just my bias now, part of it is, that I think that it's become a little too fashionable to disregard values.  So we have sort of, over the years, sort of mitigated, sort of concluded that values aren't as important.  And I think as a result, we have a whole bunch of kids, a whole bunch of teenagers, a whole bunch of young adults who, who don't, who don't have the, who don't have a, a value set that is going to allow them to be successful.  And the, I don't know what's gonna change, I don't know what's gonna turn it around, I mean, I don't know what's gonna change that because the, certainly not media, I mean, media is, media is in my opinion, I mean, they are like oblivious to the damage that they're doing to these kids.  And so that, that's the concern.
Speaker 2: Popular culture, I know, on some level is--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That, that's the concern because the, and, and, you know, I, I don't really think of myself as a, I think of myself as a fairly tolerant person but the, but when I see people who don't have that value set lined up, it doesn't have to be my value set or yours but something that just says, there's a certain amount of civility, respect, whatever.  That, that, that, that is troublesome to me.
Story_ID: 448754
Speaker 1: On the other hand--there's a whole bunch of, of kids that I see, kids, I say kids, young adults, who they're so much advanced to where I was when I was twenty-five or thirty.  I mean, they have so much more sort of a well-rounded, integrated, understanding of how the world operates than I had.  You know, when I was, you know, when I was their age, you know, I didn't have the international perspective, you know, of what was going on.  I didn't have the, I didn't have, at that point, really sort of an understanding of, of how you motivate people of different backgrounds and cultures.  And the, there's a whole bunch of these people, I meet 'em all, man, I must get, I must get two hundred calls a year from youngsters in organizations saying, you know, can I go and have lunch with you, but I can't do it all, but invariably when I go and sit down, you know, it's like, wow, this kid is twenty-five, this kid is twenty-six.  And there's a whole sort of cadre of, of, of, of youngsters like that.  What I don't know, and they, they clearly have more ability than ever in my, in my lifetime.  What I don't know is I don't know if they're gonna have the resilience to, to respond to the ups and downs of a market economy or a society.  If they can, if they can, if they can achieve the resilience, I think, that, you know, they can do remarkable things.  And, I mean, I think that's gonna be the big challenge.  So on the one hand you got, you know, I mean, it's, you, you've got kids that, you know, we could only dream about fifty years ago, you know.  I was at a wedding reception for a friend of mine's son in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] must have been about a year or two ago, and I, and, and, you know, and this kid went to Harvard Law [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and I was thinking about him, he's probably thirty, as compared to when I was thirty, and I was listening to all his friends and they're quite, you know, at the wedding they're all, and I'm saying these guys are so far ahead of where I was.  (Laughter) I mean, like, you know, by incapacities.  So I mean, they have, they have the ability to change.  The other thing I think is that, I think that the, I think that the race issue is, in terms of people being able to accept each other, I think people are much more tolerant now than they were, much more tolerant than I would have thought thirty years ago.

Speaker 1: We always ask this question--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: No, I don't, I, I, I really don't, I really can't think of something that was, that would be major that I would do differently.  If the, if, if I had one wish it would, it would be something that my mother [Kathryn Townsel Daniels] told me, which is I wish I would have been able to spend more time with my kids [Inez Daniels and John W. Daniels, III].  I mean, I try to do that, you know, but, you know, it's like they grow up and they're gone and then, you know, you wish you could have been spent, you know, a little more time.  So, I mean, I think, if, if, if I had one sort of wish, I wish I had had more time with my kids.
Story_ID: 444581
Speaker 1: That kind of segues into, you know, the family.  Tell, tell us about your family and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Well, we have, we have two kids, we have a thirty year old son [John W. Daniels, III] and a seventeen year-old-daughter [Inez Daniels], and then my wife, Irma [HistoryMaker Irma Daniels], who I've known, you know, since grade school.  And then, you know, my son is, wants to be a musician if he ever (laughter) hits it big but now, you know, he's working at the school over at my brother's campus and teaching in technology and stuff like that.  And my daughter is a senior in high school.  So that's, you know, that's our family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you, you're, of your brothers and sisters that you've got the, the, the brother that's the bishop [HistoryMaker Bishop Sedgwick Daniels] and then sister [Valerie Daniels-Carter] who's in fast food and--
Speaker 2: Sister.
Speaker 1: --you, you have another sister and another brother, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.  I have two other brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have a brother who is in South Carolina, my oldest brother [Roosevelt Daniels], and then I have a brother [Reginal Daniels] who is actually in a nursing home here.
Story_ID: 444582
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, again, can, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think the, I think to the extent I have any legacy, I think it was to, was to go into a law firm [Quarles and Brady LLP] and to retain my relationship with, with my community, retain relationship with my family, and to, and to have the institution be more reflective of me than, you know, I would have expected thirty-four years ago.  So, you know, thirty-four years ago, if somebody had said, you know, "Here's this large corporate law firm, it's going to be, you know, sponsoring the African American art exhibit for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] convention," you know, thirty-four years ago nobody would have thought that to be possible.  So I think the fact that, you know, that I've been able, you know, to deal with it on my terms, I'm not saying that I haven't, you know, had to, you know, make adjustments but that, you know, I've been able to, you know, retain the things that are important to me, I've never had to compromise, you know, anything that's, you know, that was, you know, important to me.  You know, I think that's what, you know, I would, you know, want, you know, to sort of be remembered for in this law firm.  You know, I'm sure people will probably remember more that I was chairman of a big law, a law firm because that is more, you know, obvious to the public but the, but I think, you know, just sort of, you know, saying hey, you know, I went, I, I was part of the organization and that organization in part reflects me.  It's not, you know, it's not the same as when I came.
Speaker 1: Is the percentage of, well, what's the percentage of black lawyers now here is it--
Speaker 2: Percentage of black lawyers, you know, maybe 7, 8 percent, people of color, maybe 10 percent.  The, and, you know, law firms have historically been very difficult places for lawyers of color because you need support, (laughter) you need mentors, you need clients, you need business.  You know, and the, and, you know, if you look at, you know, law firms, you know, that's just the way they operate.  So, you know, I think, you know, that's changing but not fast enough.
Story_ID: 444583
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your perspective on younger lawyers these days and their approach to their careers.
Speaker 2: I think, you know, younger lawyers, you know, generally as a, don't have the same perspective as lawyers who came out of law school with me.  And when I came out of law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] sort of the career pattern it was you want to go to, you know, for people who wanted to be in corporate law, go to a law firm, become a partner, become, you know, a significant partner, manage and run clients.  I think lawyers now, generally black, white, you know, whatever, see law as maybe one part of what they do and they don't see sort of, as a general rule, that, you know, the, coming to an organization and staying for a long, long time is necessarily, you know, what, what they intend or want to do.  And so it's a, it's a different world.  And it, one of the challenges that we have for, for particularly for lawyers of color is in law firms we have the demographic to bring them into law firms, more of them coming out of law school but you have to have support systems to keep them in the organization.  And what that means is, they gotta be on projects just like everybody else, that are exciting, that are intellectually challenging, and that propel their career.
Story_ID: 444584
Speaker 1: The last question is similar to legacy, a little different though.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I, I would just like, I think, I would like to be remembered as somebody who, who pushed the envelope in terms of business opportunities and by that I don't mean, making a lot of money, I mean, that saw things that he thought, you know, hey, we can do this, and was involved either as a, as a businessman or a lawyer in, in making 'em happen.  And that I was, you know, I was willing to, I was willing to commit to helping people because people helped me not because it was an exchange but just because that was like what I was brought up to believe, that's it's always, you know, important as a part of, you know, being a decent person to, you know, to help others.  And 'cause (laughter) I got a lot of help from a lot of guys, and a lot of it was like totally unpredicted.  I'll tell you one final thing.  I had a group of guys who were professional guys when I was in high school [Custer High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], so they were guys I looked up to, these guys, you know, had jobs, you know, as, you know, administrators or they were in companies or teachers or principals.  And they had a little group that they formed to be sort of a support group for the Boys and Girls Club [Boys and Girls Clubs of America].  And every year they would have a banquet and at that banquet they would spotlight four kids that were graduating from high school and they would say, sort of say to the community, you know, "These are kids who are, you know, who we should support."  So when I was a senior, and, and they were called the booster club.  And, and I thought these guys were, they like walked on water.  Now, I'm seventeen years old, these guys are probably thirty-five, you know, would be my guess.  And the, in 1960, in 1966, they brought Jackie Robinson to be the speaker at their annual banquet.  Now, Jackie Robinson was like God in my family.  I remember in 1955, '56 [1956], my grandmother who wasn't even a baseball fan, sitting in front of a black and white TV watching Jackie Robinson.  And when I would, when I was growing up, my dad [John W. Daniels, Sr.], you know, all he talked about was Jackie Robinson and the Dodgers [Brooklyn Dodgers; Los Angeles Dodgers], I mean, that was, I mean, that was like ingrained.  And so in 1966 these guys have this banquet, Jackie Robinson comes in, there are four of us that they're, you know, spotlighting that year.  Jackie Robinson gives a talk and it, it was, I mean, I don't even remember what he said but I just left there thinking, you know, you can just about do anything.  And the, those guys, who were sort of like the boosters, for me were like a mental picture of what could be done to move it to the next level.  Now, I didn't know it at the time but it wasn't like these guys were multimillionaires or anything else, they were just guys who had, you know, done well, come back to the community, and wanted to see the next generation of guys, do better.  And so my whole thing is I just hope that a couple of things I do, you know, somebody, some kid, not because I wanna 'em to say it about me but I just hope some kid thinks well, you know, you know, "I bumped into John Daniels [HistoryMaker John W. Daniels, Jr.] when I was, you know, fifteen years old and, you know, it helped me to think about X, Y, Z," you know.  And because those guys helped me.  So that would be a rewarding thing for me personally.
