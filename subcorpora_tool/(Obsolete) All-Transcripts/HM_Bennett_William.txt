Speaker 1: Okay.  And your favorite phrase or saying?  Do you have one, a favorite saying?
Speaker 2: Not that I'm aware of--
Story_ID: 208568
Speaker 1: So, Coach [HistoryMaker William Maurice] Bennett, let's begin by talking about your mother.  Would you please tell us your mother's name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Grace Welcher Bennett.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where did your mother grow up as a little girl?  Where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Richmond [Virginia], a little outside of Richmond, in Hanover [County, Virginia].
Speaker 1: And did she grow up in Hanover?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And did she ever tell you stories about what life was like then, when she was growing up?
Speaker 2: Normal, like most of us.  Of course, you know the story about the early days.  So, I don't need to go into that.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us a little bit.
Speaker 2: Well, she grew up in Hanover.  And when she got eighteen she moved to Richmond, and the rest of her time was spent in Richmond.  As usual, she had to work, so she worked in a tobacco factory.
Speaker 1: Did she ever talk about what the work was like in the tobacco factory, what they did?
Speaker 2: Well, they, she was working at a table they called a sorting area, where they took the leaves of tobacco and looked at them in terms of what was desired, and made certain piles I guess.  She tried to explain to me about the variety, or the ripening of tobacco at that time.  And then she, from there she went into domestic work.
Speaker 1: Did--how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: Energetic.  I would say large and very domineering.  (Laughter) She was tossed into an area where she had to look out for herself, so she had certain ideas and strategies in terms of how life should be, and she tried to live it that way.
Speaker 1: What were some of her strategies?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: What were some of her strategies, and her ideas about life?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, you did what you had to do, and did it to the best of your ability.  She wasn't domineering, but she was very positive in terms of what reaction came about as a result of whatever you did, do it the best that you can.
Story_ID: 208569
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk a little bit now about your father.  What was your father's name?
Speaker 2: My father's [sic. stepfather] name is Arthur [Bennett].
Speaker 1: Where was he born?
Speaker 2: In Richmond [Virginia].
Speaker 1: And did he grow up in Richmond?
Speaker 2: Most of the time, yes.  I did--through elementary school.
Speaker 1: What about your father.  Did your father grow up in Richmond?
Speaker 2: No, he's from the [Caribbean] Islands.
Speaker 1: Your father is?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, how did he end up moving to the United States?
Speaker 2: He was in the [U.S.] Navy.
Speaker 1: Do you remember which island he was from?
Speaker 2: Not right offhand.
Speaker 1: And your father worked as a barber?
Speaker 2: No, he was a cook.  He cooked for the officers on the ships that they were assigned.
Speaker 1: Did he ever tell you any stories about his adventures and time in the Navy?
Speaker 2: All the time (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of them?
Speaker 2: Well, none exciting, in terms of--to me, it was kind of dull.
Story_ID: 208570
Speaker 1: Coach [HistoryMaker William Maurice] Bennett, we were talking a little bit about your father [sic. stepfather, Arthur Bennett].  What kinds of stories did he share with you about being in the [U.S.] Navy?
Speaker 2: Course, I was always interested in the type of ship--the activities, in terms of the ship that he was assigned to.  Other than that, it was routine.  He was assigned as a cook for the officers of the ship that he was assigned.  They all have fairy tales to tell, in terms of excitement.  But I was interested in more or less the areas in which they traveled, and how they were received, and what events took place.  His life seemed to be uneventful, other than I was always interested in the places and location, in terms of the assignments of the ships and so forth, and what their responsibilities were.
Speaker 1: How did he and your mother [Grace Welcher Bennett] meet?  How did he meet your mother?
Speaker 2: How did I meet--
Speaker 1: No, how did your father meet your mother?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, through entertainment.  And it was taken from there.
Speaker 1: Did your father have an accent when he spoke?
Speaker 2: Vaguely.  You could hardly tell, other than certain letters like Bs or Ts.  He had a little difficulty getting those in the right places (laughter).
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your father?
Speaker 2: Energetic, domineering.  I say domineering, because I think sometimes he wanted his way.  And he was somewhat, I guess in my growing up, kind of short, in terms of explaining what he desired in terms of the outcome.
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your ancestors?  Do you know if your ancestors were slaves?
Speaker 2: Really not offhand.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, no problem.
Story_ID: 208571
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit now about your grandparents, starting with your mother's [Grace Welcher Bennett] parents.  Did you spend a lot of time with your grandparents?
Speaker 2: No, not particularly.  My mother worked, and basically the family arranged for an aunt--I lived with an aunt for quite a while.  So, between my aunt and my mother, basically they were my--they were the individuals who were responsible for my training.
Speaker 1: What was your aunt's name?
Speaker 2: Beetie [Welcher], B-E-E-T-I-E.
Speaker 1: And what was she like?
Speaker 2: Domineering and positive.  (Laughter) It had to be right, or she was not too agreeable.
Speaker 1: And did she live in Richmond [Virginia], too?
Speaker 2: Yes, she lived on Leigh Street.
Speaker 1: What about your grandparents on your father's [sic. stepfather, Arthur Bennett] side?  Did you know them at all?
Speaker 2: No--
Story_ID: 208572
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this, Coach [HistoryMaker William Maurice] Bennett.  What is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Earliest?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: My earliest in terms of living--I lived, I somewhat grew up with an aunt [Beetie Welcher] who was somewhat older than my mother [Grace Welcher Bennett].  And for my early childhood, she was the positive person in my life.  My mother worked, and I grew up with her as the foundation of my personality.
Story_ID: 208573
Speaker 1: What memories do you have of growing up?
Speaker 2: Just memories of certain areas, in terms of Richmond [Virginia] where we lived.  I grew up with an aunt [Beetie Welcher], and some of the incidents that happened during my early childhood.  Other than that--
Speaker 1: What were some of those things that you remember?
Speaker 2: I was fascinated early, I think, in terms of sirens on police cars and so forth.  From what I can gather, it seemed to have been an exciting type of activity for me.  When I heard one, I wanted to see where it was going, and things of that sort.  Other than that, it was just fascinating to hear the noise and see the excitement.
Speaker 1: And what were holidays like growing up?  Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter, what were those times like?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess they were the same to me like any other individual.  And that is, you look forward to those days as fun times--receiving gifts and receiving attention at the time of the year, and the assembly of other family members coming into the home, and the exchange of ideas and excitement.
Speaker 1: Did you get really excited as a little boy on Christmas Eve?  Was that an exciting time for you?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.  I imagine I was like anyone else; I just couldn't keep still.  I wanted to know the secrets (laughter).
Speaker 1: What was your favorite holiday, as a little boy?
Speaker 2: My favorite holiday.  Well I guess it would be Christmas, like anyone else.  I was excited in terms of Santa Claus, and the receiving of gifts.
Story_ID: 208574
Speaker 1: What street did you live on, growing up in Richmond [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Leigh Street.
Speaker 1: L-E-I-G-H, or L-E-E?
Speaker 2: L-E-I-G-H-T. [sic. L-E-I-G-H]
Speaker 1: Can you kind of describe Leigh Street for us?
Speaker 2: What's that?
Speaker 1: Can you kind of describe what Leigh Street was like when you were growing up?  What was the community like?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, I lived in a black community.  It's a street a little removed from the other race.  It's located in Richmond, in the heart of Richmond.  The northern end is the area in which the tobacco factories were built.  And those who were workers gathered in the area of--now where [Virginia] Union [University, Richmond, Virginia] is located.  I lived with an aunt [Beetie Welcher] for quite a while in my early childhood.  And she lived on top of a drugstore.  So, there was plenty of activity in the area.
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of your neighbors, growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  A very good friend of mine, his father was a seller.  He was, his father was what we called the iceman.  He sold ice to the neighborhood in the summertime, and coal and wood in the winter.
Speaker 1: He'd go door to door?
Speaker 2: Yes, door to door, or street to street.
Speaker 1: And what else do you remember about your old neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Predominantly black, had quite a few children my age.  And it was near the, I grew up near the--I would call it the intellectual area, I guess.  It was quite a few schools in the area--elementary school, middle school.  The high school was a little removed from the area.  But grammar school and middle age school, I guess you would call it, were surrounding where I grew up.
Story_ID: 208575
Speaker 1: Coach [HistoryMaker William Maurice] Bennett, tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights?  Well, I grew up in an exciting neighborhood.  There was always something going on.  Several activities in my neighborhood caused excitement, which, as a kid growing up, the sound of sirens and--
Speaker 1: What smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: What smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Smells?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: That's an odd question.  I can't recall any definite smell that--well, tobacco.  Yeah, that was predominant where I grew up.  Because, say, for us, in terms of blacks, we had to depend on labor.  And there was plenty of activity from seven to about nine [o'clock] in my neighborhood--people going to work, leaving work, in terms of the neighborhood.  If you know anything about Richmond [Virginia], the northern end of Leigh Street is up near [Virginia] Union [University, Richmond, Virginia], and to the left of Union were the individuals who owned the tobacco factories.   And those who were of low income worked in the tobacco factories.  Well, I think they called it stripping it--preparing it for sales for various departments in the area.  And in it, it had its design, in terms of how buildings were built to house and to do the things that they do to tobacco--what they call cure it, so that it would be able to be used by humans for smoking and chewing.
Speaker 1: Do you know how they cured it, what the process was for curing tobacco?
Speaker 2: No.  They had a system by which certain pieces, I mean, certain plants, tobacco plants, were placed, in terms of what they called curing.  And curing, to me, was--I guess now it's how it was prepared to be used.  If you smoked it and dried it--they used certain chemicals in terms of using it.  Some of it was prepared for chewing, and some of it was prepared for smoking.  And those were the, I guess my grandmother [Sarah Welcher] would say those were the vices, in terms of tobacco, to the human being.
Story_ID: 208576
Speaker 1: What elementary school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Moore Street [School; George Washington Carver Elementary School, Richmond, Virginia].
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: The school was named after the street it was located.
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of your teachers at Moore Street School?  Do you remember some of your teachers there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember one.  A tall, stately lady by the name of Cox, C-O-X.  Mrs. Cox, she was a dominant figure in I guess my life, in terms of she was on me like white on rice.  I wasn't a--to her, the normal student.  I was always in trouble (laughter).
Speaker 1: What kind of trouble did you get into?
Speaker 2: Oh, normal childhood activities--not doing things that you were told to do at the time it was supposed to be done, well, the normal things that children grew up in.  I grew up in an environment where there were other children for me to play with, or become involved with.  And I guess in my neighborhood, I was somewhat the individual who had always had something going.
Speaker 1: What type of student were you in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Normal.  I wasn't outstanding, just normal.
Speaker 1: What were some of your favorite subjects?
Speaker 2: I would say math and biology.
Speaker 1: When you were in elementary school, did you have dreams and aspirations?  What did you think you wanted to be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: I guess my family could answer that.  I guess I wanted to be whatever was attractive to me at the time, at an age where one would want to be like the individual he or she admired.
Speaker 1: Who did you admire during elementary school?
Speaker 2: I wanted to be a fireman.  I liked the excitement in terms of the activity that firemen showed me, or indicated to me in their work, as far as protecting a family in a time of strife, which is fire, a house on fire or an automobile fire.  Those things were exciting, I guess, and attracted my interest.
Story_ID: 208577
Speaker 1: Did you and your family attend church growing up?  Did you all go to church?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of your church?
Speaker 2: Yes, Moore Street [Missionary Baptist] Church [Richmond, Virginia].
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like at Moore Street Church?
Speaker 2: Well, normal, the normal activities that children grow up in.  I went to Sunday school, I went to church.  I had a somewhat religious background.  I had to--I had an aunt [Beetie Welcher] that was somewhat dominant in terms of--all of the family children looked up to her in terms of going to church and Sunday school.
Speaker 1: Was she very active in the church?
Speaker 2: What's that?
Speaker 1: Was she very active in the church?
Speaker 2: Yes.  In fact, almost ran it (laughter).
Speaker 1: What did you like doing best at church?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: What did you like doing the most at church?  Did you sing in the choir, and--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: I liked BYPU [Baptist Young People's Union of America].
Speaker 1: What's BYPU?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  I don't know.  It's an organization for children who were in elementary school.  It's, as you get older, your activities--your desires, your activities and so forth change.  And in it, it's designed to help young people grow and adjust, in terms of age, their ages.  It's an organization that meets in churches in the evenings, and it's someplace for young people to go.
Speaker 1: What kinds of things did you do in that organization?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Oh, you learn certain biblical things, in terms of living, to help you to adjust in terms of church.  You learn some of the basic fundamentals of religion.
Story_ID: 208578
Speaker 1: So, Coach [HistoryMaker William Maurice] Bennett, let's talk a little bit about when you left Richmond [Virginia] to go to Portsmouth [Virginia] to live with your mother [Grace Welcher Bennett].  What was the name of the school you attended there?
Speaker 2: In Portsmouth?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think of the name of the first school I went to.
Speaker 1: The Moore Street School [George Washington Carver Elementary School, Richmond, Virginia] was the first one in Richmond.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean there--
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: --when I went to my mother's.  Um--
Speaker 1: That's okay.  But you moved to Portsmouth when you were about thirteen or so?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So that was around 1928?
Speaker 2: Somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: What was Portsmouth like?
Speaker 2: Typical naval environment.  Everything dealt with water.  The neighborhood was surrounded by water.  Most of the work done there was involving water.  So--
Speaker 1: Did you like it there?
Speaker 2: It was alright.
Speaker 1: How did you like it, compared to Richmond?
Speaker 2: Well, it was from one extreme to the other.  Richmond had no activities that really involved water.  And all the activities in the Tidewater [Virginia] area is just what it says, water.
Speaker 1: Who do you think was influencing you around the teenage years, like thirteen or fourteen years old?  Who do you think was influencing you the most?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: Who was influencing you most?
Speaker 2: Oh, who?  My mother.  My father [sic. stepfather, Arthur Bennett] was in the [U.S.] Navy, so he was not at home as much.  She was there constantly, for most of my desires or activities.  So, she was the predominant person in my life during that period.
Speaker 1: And so, during that time, were you still wanting to be a fireman?
Speaker 2: No, not necessarily.
Speaker 1: What were you wanting to be when you grew up, during that time?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess I was influenced by the activities of the male.  You know, sailors, all type of sailor activities were involved in the neighborhood.  And it was, the neighborhoods were controlled by sailors, or men of the water.  So--
Speaker 1: So, were you thinking you were going to join the Navy when you grew up?
Speaker 2: Not necessarily.  My mother wanted me to be different.
Speaker 1: Different how?
Speaker 2: Well, be different in terms of being in the Navy.  I assume that she said one person in the family in the Navy was enough.  (Laughter) So, she was strictly for education.
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about how you spent your time.  What did you like to do in your spare time?
Speaker 2: Oh, I guess what boys normally want to do at certain ages--shoot marbles--
Speaker 1: Were you any good at shooting marbles?
Speaker 2: Fair.  With me being involved in sports, when I got to the age that I could participate in the senior sports, I call it, in terms of basketball, baseball, tennis, whatnot--I was somewhat attracted to the various, I guess you could call game activities.  I went through that period, like most boys and girls do.  And that is, you select one or the other, and it becomes your favorite sport.
Speaker 1: Which was your favorite sport?
Speaker 2: Well, according to the age.  I started, like most, I shot marbles.  And from there, I went on to the next step in terms of your running games.  You know, your tags games, and things of that sort.  And it was, I guess invigorating.  And then from there, I moved into the area of sports.
Story_ID: 208579
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit now about high school.  What was the name of the high school you attended?
Speaker 2: In Portsmouth [Virginia]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I.C. Norcom [High School, Portsmouth, Virginia].
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like in high school?
Speaker 2: Well, my high school time was in Portsmouth.  And I tried, like most boys, I tried to play all the games in terms of baseball, basketball, football.  I had--
Speaker 1: What about track?
Speaker 2: --a yearning for tennis at one time.  But you know, you go through those phases of activities.
Speaker 1: Did you like tennis?
Speaker 2: Well, I liked it, because I had a good friend who had a tennis court in the backyard.
Speaker 1: Well, that was unusual, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Of course, the whole family was involved in tennis.  And he happened to be one of my best friends when I was growing up.  And I had an opportunity to learn a little about tennis.  So, that's the way I grew up, I guess.
Speaker 1: So, in high school, you were a pretty good track athlete.
Speaker 2: Fair.
Speaker 1: Fair?  You set a state record that stood for twenty years in the 440[-yard dash].
Speaker 2: Well, I guess--I don't know how I got involved in track, other than there was a fellow who turned out to be our high school coach who lived in my neighborhood.  And he was involved with a lady, in terms of--who was the mother--I mean who was the sister to the mother of one of our best friends.  So at that time he was an inspiration, I guess, in terms of my wanting to run track.  He was an energetic, collegiate individual who lived in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Waters [ph.].
Speaker 1: Coach Waters?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you want to be like Coach Waters?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, I wanted to be like him.  He was a dominant figure in my neighborhood.  He could do so many different things well.
Speaker 1: And during high school when you set that track record, were you a pretty popular guy at school?
Speaker 2: I guess I was average (laughter).  This is intriguing to me--you as a girl asking--I mean telling me about--(laughter).  It's, well, during that period, you know, you begin to mature, and your objectives and your desires and so forth are changeable, and they almost change daily.  So, I was intrigued and encouraged, in terms of participating in track and field, through him.  He was the high school coach and the neighborhood idol, in terms of his ability to do things as far as sports were concerned.
Speaker 1: Which did you like best, football or track?
Speaker 2: Well, according to the age, you had to be--in football you had to have certain--you had to be--you just couldn't get away from--you couldn't substitute something for it.  So, therefore, you had to either grow up and be a certain height and weight, and what not.  So, there were certain physical attributes that you had to have to be worthwhile.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what position did you play in high school, in football?
Speaker 2: Halfback.
Speaker 1: Halfback?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Were you good, as halfback?
Speaker 2: Pretty good.  (Laughter) I thought so.
Story_ID: 208580
Speaker 1: When you were in high school [I.C. Norcom High School, Portsmouth, Virginia], Coach [HistoryMaker William Maurice] Bennett, what were your thoughts about college?
Speaker 2: Well, college was not in my realm of thinking.  College came late, in terms of my experiences.  You had to be a certain height, a certain weight, a certain--you had to have certain attributes to be wanted on a team.  And that began early in your childhood.  And so, by the time that I was mature enough to understand and be a part of--I had gotten up to an age where I was fifteen or sixteen, and that's kind of maturing.
Speaker 1: Were you thinking you wanted to go to college?
Speaker 2: Well, college came late in my life.  I was not surrounded by college activities.  I was not in a family where college was dominant.  Everybody didn't go to college.
Speaker 1: But you did end up getting a football scholarship?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: To Virginia State University [Virginia State College for Negroes, Petersburg, Virginia].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you graduated from high school in 1936.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And you went to Virginia State after high school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what were your thoughts when you got to Petersburg [Virginia] and you got to Virginia State?  What did you think of the campus?
Speaker 2: Oh, I thought it was--my experience at the time with college was limited.  My mother [Grace Welcher Bennett] didn't go to college.  I was predominantly--I was, she was the dominant person in my life.  My father [Milton Shelton] and my mother had separated, so there was--I didn't have that fatherly influence.  So I was, I substituted, I think, my high school coach, in terms of being--for those things that normally a father would do or think.
Speaker 1: So, when you came to Virginia State, you were an athlete.  What was a typical day like for a member of the football team back in 1936?
Speaker 2: Typical day?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: Go to class, practice football, whatever position that you're aspiring to attain.
Speaker 1: Were you still playing halfback?
Speaker 2: When I came to college?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, you practiced.  And then what did you do after practice?
Speaker 2: I'd go home and go to bed.  No, well, you practiced, and somewhat your day was regimented to the things, whatever the coach wanted you to do, in terms of not being on the field.  You had to go to class, and there were certain requirements in terms of class, so you know what I'm talking about.  And you tried to make the best grades you could, in terms of whatever interests you had at that time, whether it was science, or history, or what not, so.  The typical day for an athlete would be--I hate to say this, but basically most of the athletes, the sport he is interested in comes first, and learning came later.  They tried hard to reverse that, but it's still--as I look at it, it's still in the same position it was when I was on the job.
Story_ID: 208581
Speaker 1: Now, did all the football players live in the same dorm?
Speaker 2: Where, at [Virginia State] College [for Negroes; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia]?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And were you guys pretty popular guys on campus?
Speaker 2: Coming from a female, yes.  (Laughter) We thought we were popular.
Speaker 1: And the females thought so, too, huh?
Speaker 2: Some of them.  (Laughter) I think the inspiration that the female had for an athlete is good and great, according to where you go to school.  But basically, it's the same at all schools.
Speaker 1: Was it ever distracting?
Speaker 2: I think that the individual allows the sport to be distracting to learning.  And that is, we all have this type of thought, I guess, in terms of which comes first.  And those who are interested in learning have a problem with those who have allowed the sport to take over, in terms of general learning.
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk a little bit about your time at Virginia State.  You participated in two CIAA [Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association] track championships.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, you ran track and played football at Virginia State?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: As a student, what was that like, to be a double athlete?
Speaker 2: Well, it's sort of arranged, in terms of organizing by the United States, that all of the schools use the same pattern.  And that is that the sports world is divided, in terms of segments for the athlete.  He can participate in more than one, if so desired.
Speaker 1: Was it hard, though?
Speaker 2: Well, it might be distracting, but that's up to the individual in terms of how much they--how well they are supervised and encouraged in terms of their success.  That plays a great part in it.
Speaker 1: Were you nurtured and encouraged when you were at Virginia State?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who was your coach?
Speaker 2: --so much so that I was given scholarships (laughter).
Story_ID: 208582
Speaker 1: Who was your coach at Virginia State [College for Negroes; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Football coach was [Harry R. "Big Jeff"] Jefferson.  Track coach was [Thomas] Verdell.
Speaker 1: And did you admire them?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: How were they different from your high school [I.C. Norcom High School, Petersburg, Virginia] coach?
Speaker 2: They had all the same format; they all used the same systems.  And I guess there's a normal attitude in America to have these sports designed so they take part and they become dominant for the individual athlete during certain periods of the year.  So, the student makes the decision in terms of how much he will, how much time he will put in, and in the sport of his interest.  And you know, there's two ways you can look at it.  One is that you put too much time in athletics, and not enough in terms of general living.  And I guess we all get carried away in certain ways, in terms of training the mind or the ability of the individual.
Speaker 1: Of all of your coaches, who do you think you are most like?  Who do you think your coaching style was most like?
Speaker 2: My what?
Speaker 1: Your coaching style.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Who was it most like?  Your high school coach, your football coach, or your track coach?
Speaker 2: I think my learning and desire was more in terms of high school.  My high school coach took a lot of--as I look back now, he really was interested in me in terms of developing--the time he spent with me and the time that he gave to me in terms of guidance, teaching, and the like.

Speaker 1: In 1941, you played in the [Chicago Charities] College All-Star Game against the Chicago Bears.  What was that like?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know where that come from.  I never heard of that until--I guess the organization was the one who started it, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, let's talk about--also in 1941, you graduated from Virginia State [College for Negroes; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You got your degree in physical education.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What were you thinking you were going to do professionally?
Speaker 2: Set the world on fire (laughter).  Well, no, I guess I was like the normal person, in terms of graduating.  I was elated to be graduating from Virginia State on time.
Speaker 1: Were you wanting to become a teacher?
Speaker 2: I had fairly decent grades.  What?
Speaker 1: Were you wanting to become a teacher?
Speaker 2: Well, my training was for me to be a teacher.  When I say training, it's that basically the foundation for physical education is to be an instructor in some phase of physical exertion.
Story_ID: 208584
Speaker 1: And so, you were drafted into the [U.S.] Army the same year [1941]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And became interested in a new sport, boxing. Tell us a little bit about how that happened.
Speaker 2: Well, I think that probably Joe Louis was the inspiration, in terms of that at the time.  Being an athlete, I wanted to be the best that I could, in terms of whatever interests I had at the time and age that I was.  And the odd part about this is that when I was growing up, in various areas, in terms of learning and growing, I had a thing I used to say in terms of boxing.  And yet, I became a boxer.  And that was, "Nobody boxes but fools or freshmen."  (Laughter) So, I don't know.  I got involved in boxing during the time of war [World War II, WWII].  And Joe Louis, you know, I guess I somewhat tried to be like certain athletes.  And I guess Joe Louis put his two cents in.  So--
Speaker 1: Were you pretty good?
Speaker 2: When I was growing up, boxing was not the thing for me, you know.  Well, I think that I used the Army, in terms of trying to extend my physical prowess, in terms of boxing.  The Army had certain standards and things that an individual was interested in.  When I was in the Army, I was interested in boxing.  I didn't box in high school [I.C. Norcom High School, Portsmouth, Virginia], I didn't box in college [Virginia State College for Negroes; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia].  But somewhere I saw an advantage to my being a boxer in the service, when I was drafted.  See, I was--the day I was--the time I graduated was the time that I was drafted.  So, I guess I was looking for the same type of living and standards for me in the Army, and that's where I started to box.  I didn't box in high school.
Speaker 1: How did you become so--
Speaker 2: And I didn't box in college.
Speaker 1: How did you become so good at boxing?
Speaker 2: I guess the other sports that I'd participated in somewhat gave me an edge.  Other than that, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Because you were the lightweight champion.
Speaker 2: Wow.  Then I was in an area where, I was here at Virginia State.  I had been to Fort Lee [Virginia].  I knew something about Fort Lee--
Speaker 1: Fort Lee, Virginia?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And so when I was drafted, I was sent here, where?  Fort Lee.  I was sent here in Virginia, right at the doorsteps of where I got my education.  So, I just, I guess luck was just my way.  And then again I look at--whatever I tried to do, I tried to be the best, whatever it is.  So, I guess that was my attitude.
Story_ID: 208585
Speaker 1: While in the [U.S.] Army, Coach [HistoryMaker William Maurice] Bennett, you met your wife [Katherine Bennett].  How did you meet your wife?
Speaker 2: A friend of mine introduced me to my wife; they were both from the same hometown.  And I was just introduced, and things clicked, I guess (laughter).  You're getting a kick out of this (laughter).  Well, he was interested in our getting together.  He was interested in my meeting Katherine, and so it happened.  And the result was we got married.
Speaker 1: So, you all--
Speaker 2: We had things in common, I guess at the time.
Speaker 1: And you got married in 1946?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 208586
Speaker 1: So after you got married [to Katherine Bennett], you got a job in Hampton [Virginia], at the [George P.] Phenix School [Hampton, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, tell us a little bit about your experiences at the Phenix School.
Speaker 2: Well, I went there as a new name, a physical education instructor, which turned out to be a coach (laughter).  Well, it was--see, the high school is really on Hampton Institute [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] property.  And it is the high school, like D. Webster Davis [Laboratory High School, Petersburg, Virginia] is, in terms of Virginia State [College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia].  So, the pattern looked like, in terms of education, is that some of your most outstanding or more prevalent colleges--I mean high schools--are outstanding colleges.  So, Phenix is to Hampton what D. Webster Davis is to Virginia State.  It is a place where the students who are interested in high school activities can get some understanding and training at the college level.  When I say college--when you're in college, you can deal with the high school aspect.  And if you--well, it's an introduction to another--what do I want to say, area of living.  See, you go to college, and you end up as a teacher.  But you didn't go to college to be a teacher (laughter).  But anyway, your training and learning in college helps you, in terms of decisions that you will make for yourself in life.  So, I went to Phenix as a high school coach, and along with it I took track.  But really, I went there as a football coach.
Speaker 1: How did you enjoy coaching, your first coaching job?
Speaker 2: All right, fine.  Also, I took with me--I didn't take--but they hired another fellow from Virginia State in football.  So, we, as two individuals, we teamed up and did the coaching down there, in terms of high school.  And they turned out to be champions, so that's where I got my start--
Story_ID: 208587
Speaker 1: You left the [George P.] Phenix School [Hampton, Virginia] in 1953 when you were offered a coaching job at Virginia State University [Virginia State College, Petersburg, Virginia].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What did you think about the opportunity to teach on the collegiate level?
Speaker 2: I thought it was--and to be at the school that I went to--oh, you shouldn't ask that question; you know how I felt (laughter).  Well, I was elated, in terms of the coaches and the people who I had dealings with, in terms of training me in that aspect.  So, I was elated and I came to Virginia State.
Speaker 1: Were you a little nervous?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't nervous, but I was excited.  Now, you call that nervousness, but all that is a part of--well, the relationship I had with Coach [Harry R. "Big Jeff"] Jefferson was nothing but the best.  So, I was elated, in terms of the university wanted me to come in.  So, here I am.
Speaker 1: Did you feel like there was going to be a lot of pressure because you were filling some pretty big shoes?
Speaker 2: No.  You know, nothing of that sort transpired.  The size of the shoes had nothing to do with my thinking.  I know what you're saying.  But you're either, you're frightened, or you're not aware of certain aspects of the job itself.  I guess I had--I'm the type that really didn't--it didn't really strike me, in terms of the area in which I was about to become involved with would be so outreaching.  I was elated, in terms of wanting to--someone wanted me to come, in terms of where I gotten all of the training that I had.  And well, I must have done something good, because I'm still here.
Speaker 1: So, your return to Virginia State was more than ten years after you had graduated.  And how had the school and the football program changed in the ten or thirteen years since you had been at Virginia State?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess the "Jeffersonian" aspect of coaching must be pretty good, because we are still using people who came in under Coach Jefferson and Dr. [James Arthur] Moore.  I think that was a combination that really brought more of a combination of teachers and coaches and what not.  If you want to put them in--I call them teachers, because I think you teach a lot when you coach.  And I don't think that they really use the word coaching right.  I think you're still a teacher when you take the athlete and show him the ways by which he can use his body and use what he's normally given as a human being to be an asset to his general living.  So, that's my attitude or my thoughts in terms of coaching.
Story_ID: 208588
Speaker 1: While you were at Virginia State [College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia], Coach [HistoryMaker William Maurice] Bennett--you were here for over thirty years--you coached nearly fifty All-American athletes.  And one that I want to ask you about is Wilbur "Pony" Wilson.  In 1954 he broke the long jump record, and qualified for the Olympic trials.  What was it like coaching him?
Speaker 2: Well, he and I were very good friends.  He's one of those individuals who had high aspirations for himself.  Not only was he a great athlete, he was a great person.  And he was a coach in New Jersey [at Rutgers University-Camden, Camden, New Jersey] for quite a while, and well thought of in the towns that he coached.  And I hate to say this, from both races.  He's dead now, but he was a true athlete.  And when I say athlete, not just what he got out of being an athlete, but he had certain aspirations for his participants.
Speaker 1: Who are some of the other athletes who come to mind that you've coached, who you kind of remember fondly?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Well, let me ask you this actually, Coach.  When Wilbur "Pony" Wilson qualified for the Olympic trials, how did that make you feel, as his coach?
Speaker 2: How did it make me feel?  Well, great.  Because I felt that something I had done or had given to him was worthwhile, or paying off, in terms of his being able to reach the height of his athletic career.  And "Pony" Wilson was not only a great athlete, he was a great person.  He had certain rules and regulations that he had set for himself.  And he achieved many of the things through his desire, not that it was something that he stumbled into.  He opened a lot of doors, in terms of getting into the position to be able to do some of the things that he did.  Because he was a--he went back to his hometown [Haddonfield, New Jersey], he was a great coach too.
Story_ID: 208589
Speaker 1: Let's talk about some of the changes that perhaps you were noticing throughout the years in athletes.  What are some of the biggest changes that you noticed with athletes throughout the years, as a coach [at Virginia State University (VSU), Petersburg, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: What is that?  What do I--
Speaker 1: What are some of the biggest changes that have taken place with athletes, and on the collegiate level since you've been a coach?
Speaker 2: Some of the biggest changes?
Speaker 1: Do you think that nowadays athletes are a little bit more interested in trying to go professional, opposed to getting an education, and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: I think that the athletes are getting--well, it takes money.  You have me in a position now that I don't know how to answer that question.  Because whatever the individual ends up being or doing is based on the amount of money that can be raised or given, to make sure that that individual gets an opportunity to experience the type of training or the type of learning he desires.  I think that wherever there is success, there is money.  And I think that you need that, in terms of the general existence of individuals.  And the type of individual you get will be based on the amount of money that you can raise, or can be given.
Speaker 1: While you were coaching at VSU, you led the [Virginia State] Trojans to victory in ten conference championships and two CIAA [Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association] championships.  What do you think was your key to success?
Speaker 2: To that success?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: The key was that I participated.  (Laughter) I had an opportunity to show to the world, or the individuals that were involved in the sport, that it was supported by the people of that particular area.  Like Virginia State, I think we all set goals for ourselves.  And to try to reach those, you do certain things.  And if those things are successful, you just pass them on to the next individual.  Or, the athlete that you coach pick up the better part of your program and goes further with it.
Story_ID: 208590
Speaker 1: Who was your biggest rival?
Speaker 2: You mean?
Speaker 1: In terms of other teams.  Was Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] a pretty big rival at Virginia State [University, Petersburg, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Oh, Hampton has always been a rival.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Well, that's the question.  (Laughter) I mean, that's the answer.  If I can get, if I can get an answer to that question, Virginia State would be a success.
Speaker 1: So, like, what was the atmosphere like on campus, like right before the big game with Hampton?  What would the atmosphere be like?
Speaker 2: Well, it's normal for each game.  You set your sights, in terms of the day--I mean the weeks--the practice periods before you participate.  In terms of the contest, what you're asking for--those are the periods in which you develop attitudes, skills, through training the individuals that you consider as athletes of that particular sport.  So, I think that those schools that have facilities and individuals who are interested in that particular sport, are the schools that are successful.  And I think that's where a lot of our--probably educators or individuals who are in charge--lose sight of.  I think that that governs the whole situation.
Story_ID: 208591
Speaker 1: How is your coaching style different from Coach [Harry R. "Big Jeff"] Jefferson?
Speaker 2: My coaching--I mean, well, I think you're saying--I have picked up some of Coach Jefferson's philosophy.  I think that what you're looking for is that I pick from the individuals that I know and meet, I pick up certain things, or select certain attitudes and things to do that are beneficial to me, in terms of the success that they have had.  I guess that might answer your question.
Speaker 1: Do you think you're more like Coach Waters [ph.] or more like Coach Jefferson?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm a combination.  I'm a little bit of everything, in terms of the--what has got me started, and I guess planted the type of interest--contact and so forth, of the sport--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, Coach [HistoryMaker William Maurice] Bennett, hold on one second.  I'm sorry.  So, you were talking about Coach Waters.
Speaker 2: Well, I guess I got a little--I was fortunate to have individuals or have coaches interested in me in terms of an individual, and to give to me or to develop in me an attitude to try and be the best that I can, in terms of the coaching field.
Story_ID: 208592
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this, Coach [HistoryMaker William Maurice] Bennett.  Like, when you're preparing--give us an idea of what a typical day is like for you as a coach.  You told us what a typical day is like as an athlete, when you were an athlete.  But what was the typical day like for you as a coach?
Speaker 2: Well, a typical day as a coach is that, of course--you're asking me now what do I do?  I go to the Y [Young Men's Christian Association, YMCA].  Number one, I think that an athlete must recognize the fact that his body is the instrument in which produces the individual.  And for the--for an example, the individuals who are the best in that particular sport is the best because they put the sport first, before anything else, in terms of a general living pattern.
Speaker 1: Put the sport before anything else?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And when I said that, I mean you establish certain criteria for yourself, in terms of how you will react to certain counter-reactions.  Nothing stops the individual who is really concerned about being the best that they can be, in a particular event or sport.  He establishes a code or criteria that remains the same, regardless of what happens in terms of the general living pattern.  Nothing can change that, if that individual is really conscientious in terms of participating or coaching, or whatever he's doing with that particular sport or activity.
Speaker 1: Now, would you, like, watch tapes of other teams and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about that, and just, that process.
Speaker 2: I mean, it's according to what you're looking for when you're watching it.  Do you mean scouting?
Speaker 1: No.  Like, would you watch tapes of teams that you were going to play?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  What we try to do, you try to pick up, you try to pick up things or acts that the opponent will show you in terms of--and I assume you mean looking at pictures and what not.  I assume you were thinking in terms of--you try to pick up some of the weaknesses that may prevail, in terms of the opponent.  You try to find out what is weak, in terms of the type of activity it is.  The weak areas are the areas in terms of--it's the area you want to attack and be able to produce an advantage for you or your team.  So, that's what is basically being done.  It's that you look at teams, or you scout teams, or you go to teams, and try to find out what their weaknesses are.  And your strength would be for you to develop more structure, performance, to get the opponent out of a pattern of behavior, if you follow me.  If they, if you can disrupt that, then you have done something that the opposing coach does not want to happen.  If that happens, then he's going to be a loser.
Story_ID: 208593
Speaker 1: What would other teams target against the VSU [Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] Trojans?  What was the Trojans' weakness?  What do you think?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  If there's a weakness, it's something that needs to be corrected.  And that's what the coach's job is, is to correct the things that are causing mistakes for his team, for that particular team.  And that's the difference in great coaches, and coaches, and some coaches (laughter).
Speaker 1: Which category do you fall in?
Speaker 2: I don't know (laughter).  I guess, coaching, I'm just a coach.
Speaker 1: I think probably a great coach.  You were [Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association] Coach of the Year five different times.  And how did you feel the first time, in 1962, when you were Coach of the Year?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's one of the great things about coaching, is that when you--when someone recognizes your worth, in terms of that particular sport, then I don't know, that's just a feeling one has.  That's a physical feeling one has in terms of success.
Speaker 1: Is it a measurement of success?
Speaker 2: It's a measurement of success, yes, yes.  But who does that measuring?  (Laughter) It's according to who's measuring you.  Well, I think that it's probably a process, and all of us are looking for the same thing.  At the end of the season, or the end of the road, or end of whatever it is, you're looking for some type of success.  And according to the type or the amount of success, it's based on your performance.
Story_ID: 208594
Speaker 1: How do you think people would describe your coaching style?  What is the [HistoryMaker William Maurice] Bennett style of coaching?
Speaker 2: I didn't know I had a style.  Well, according to what you're coaching, it's all the same, in terms of what reaction you get from the individual that you are participating with.  I think that what you look for, you look for an individual who has the ingredients, or have the makeup, or have the attitude in terms of the sport that you are trying to prevail.  The thing that I look at is--to try and answer your question--what attributes, what things do this individual or that individual have to fit the position that you're trying to cover for that sport?  And you already have a code that you are using to select that individual.  And that individual must have one, two, three, four, five--you know, to be considered for the position or for the sport that you're trying to increase production.  And I don't know how to put it, other than you try to develop certain muscular attributes or muscular control, so that the individual is capable of using those attributes or those skills to the best of his or her ability.  And that's about the end of it.  I don't know anything else, other than you select an individual that has all of the qualities that you feel will be--will develop the individual into being the best that he or she can be, with what physical attributes they already have.
Story_ID: 208595
Speaker 1: Do you think that some athletes who play sports at historically black colleges [and universities (HBCUs)] or predominantly black colleges--do you think they're measured and judged the same way as white athletes or athletes who don't attend HBCUs?
Speaker 2: I don't follow your--
Speaker 1: Are the standards the same?
Speaker 2: The standards are the same.  The standards are the same.  The ability to develop it is not the same.
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: Because we are individuals, we're separate individuals.  For me, I have--in my developing of individuals to do certain things to the best of their ability, and that means whatever they have physically, to do the best that I can.  Now, if I never reach that point, then that individual will not be successful.  And that's about the end of it, in terms of that individual.  If the structure is not there, you can't put it there.
Speaker 1: Well, do you think that athletes, for example, do you think an athlete or a football player at Virginia State University [Petersburg, Virginia] gets the same opportunities as, say for example, an athlete at Wake Forest [University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina] or UVA [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia] or Virginia Tech [Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: You read the newspapers (laughter).  They are supposed to get the same.  But you must remember, now, each one of us is a separate individual.  Now, it's up to what that individual thinks is best for that particular person.  Like, we get these, what we call--the better athletes go to the better schools.  Why?  Because the individual who is in charge of that particular program has developed a thing for the individuals that are going to come to his school, or who are going to be in his direct supervision, as far as his abilities are concerned.  Great coaches make great players.  And that's the way it's designed.
Speaker 1: Well, let me ask you this.  What impact or effect did desegregation have on the quality of athletes you got at Virginia State University after desegregation?  Did you notice that some of the better players were now going to predominantly white schools?
Speaker 2: Well, that's normal.  That was being done before.  We weren't getting the better players, so I know what you're trying to get to.  Most of our better athletes, black, are now going to white schools.  Why?  There is a monetary value, in terms of his going there.  There are opportunities also attached, in terms of later life.  So, if the individuals, in terms of states, countries and what not, are geared--in terms of doing things that help the individual to developing the skills--develop the skills that are needed in the thing that you are attempting to do--not only athletes, it's general living.  You develop those skills that you need to be in the forerun for that particular area or position.
Story_ID: 208596
Speaker 1: Do you think that black schools [historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs)] help athletes develop those skills more so than white schools do?
Speaker 2: No, I don't say they do.  But I think that the--for that individual to develop to a certain level, he has, or she has, to be the one who decides that.  There's no decisions can be made from outside for an individual to develop what normally she has, to that level of competitiveness that is necessary for that person to be selected or taken out of that category and put into another one, if you follow me.  I don't think you would take something that is not worthwhile in what you are doing for me, unless you have something, you have seen something there worthwhile for you.  I think that what I'm trying to say is that an athlete is developed to do the things that he or she has already.  So, you have legs and strength and muscles and so forth that need to be dealt with daily, to maintain the position that you've already placed yourself in.
Speaker 1: But today, in 2004, if say, for example, a star athlete from Virginia had the opportunity to get a full scholarship at Virginia Tech [Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia]--a football scholarship to play on their team, or Virginia State [University, Petersburg, Virginia] to play on their team--
Speaker 2: I'm listening.
Speaker 1: Why do you think he'd get the better deal by coming to Virginia State?  Or do you think that?
Speaker 2: A better deal in terms of what?  Are you thinking in terms--are you thinking about finance or are you thinking about--
Speaker 1: A better deal in overall development.  Do you think he would be a better athlete at the end of his college career if he came to Virginia State?
Speaker 2: Depending on where he's coming from.
Speaker 1: Well, let's just say, you know, he's the best in the state, the best high school football player in the state.
Speaker 2: Well, there are so many other things.  You have too many variables, in terms of development, for the person to continue to be in that category.  Because he's stepping up another level, and he's going to be faced with another opposition.  So, it's according to what--
Speaker 1: Which school has the better program?
Speaker 2: Oh, now, now, you're trying to find out--well, you know which would have the better program in terms of money, finance.  And the way we have it set up in the State of Virginia, the State of Virginia will always be the State of Virginia, because the money is in the hands of the opposite race.  And if you're going to consider the betterment, in terms of the type of treatment that individual will receive, you have to say that it's the other school.  But that's not always true in terms of development.
Story_ID: 208597
Speaker 1: In your opinion, how do you think a school like Virginia State [University, Petersburg, Virginia] is better in development of an athlete?
Speaker 2: I don't say that it's any better.  I think that all of the development, in terms of that individual, is a person who decides whether or not this is best for him, see.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this, Coach [HistoryMaker William Maurice] Bennett.  If, in 1936 you had the opportunity--you had a scholarship at Virginia Tech [Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia] or Virginia State--which do you think you would have taken?
Speaker 2: There are just so many other variables in there, see.  I'm looking at--in the first place, it's supposed to be an educating institution.  Now, if you are considering all of the other variables with this--we know where the money is, so we know where the individual probably will go, because of the facility, the general public attitude.  And there are so many other variables to consider in terms of what is best for that individual.  I'd say that that individual has some--I'm trying to get--that individual has some insight in terms of what they want to do.  And regardless of what and how you attempt to do that, to develop that area has to be dealt with the individual, and not, you know, something intangible.
Speaker 1: Do you think that sometimes an environment at an HBCU [historically black colleges and universities] is more nurturing than at a predominantly white school, for African American athletes?
Speaker 2: Say that again.
Speaker 1: Do you think that the environment at a historically black school is more nurturing for an athlete?
Speaker 2: According to the athlete; that's according to the athlete.  See, by going to a different high school, I mean a different college, may not be the best thing, in terms of development.  So, what you're looking at is so many variables in there--attitude, experience.  What experiences has the athlete had, or the individual has had in the past?  There are so many other variables that it's hard to come out and say this is the right way, or this is the wrong way.  It's--I don't know what--I think that's what we base our win and loss scale on.  You know, the only way I can see to do this is to take the two schools and let them play.  Or, take the two individuals and let them do whatever they're supposed to be best in, and see what the outcome is.  That's kind of hard to do.
Speaker 1: What do you think about Virginia State's program today?  Is it still the same program it was under your leadership?
Speaker 2: I don't know what you mean now, in terms of my leadership.  What are you talking about?
Speaker 1: Well, under your leadership--
Speaker 2: You mean track and field?
Speaker 1: Track and field and football.  There are a lot of championships under your belt.
Speaker 2: I may have--I think that, also, you must give the individual who is participating the better part of that particular program.
Story_ID: 208598
Speaker 1: Do you think that good coaches lose?  Do good coaches lose?
Speaker 2: Lose, good coaches?  Sure, they lose.  They lose because of the ability of the two teams, like the ability of one person to overcome another person in terms of whatever you're attempting, to decide the better.  I think that's what you're trying to do, is what the State of Virginia is trying to do.
Speaker 1: What's that?
Speaker 2: They're trying to balance it off.  See, they have set it up so that you will have the better white, and the better black.  But the better blacks don't play the better whites (laughter).  See, the thing is that, really it's not near to, or set up to influence that type of thinking.  You're looking for one outstanding team in terms of a sport.  And that's tough to do.
Speaker 1: How does a good coach measure his success?
Speaker 2: On who plays, how well he plays.  See, success is not altogether, all the time, the better person or the better team.  But that's the way we have our standards set up.  See, when you started putting variables into the program, you are destroying some of the things that may be the best for one or the other.  You take the best from this one and give it to the better, I mean, to the less fortunate.  See, we've got all types of thinking, in terms of who is the better, who can be the best or the better.  And that's done only by eliminating, elimination (laughter).  And we don't like to do that.

Speaker 1: Coach [HistoryMaker William Maurice] Bennett, when you look back at your life, what stands out the most to you, and why?
Speaker 2: When I look back at my life, what stands out the most?  Like what?
Speaker 1: Anything.  What stands out the most to you about your life?
Speaker 2: My life?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: You mean what sport, or what?
Speaker 1: Anything.  What stands out the most to you?
Speaker 2: What am I known for?
Speaker 1: What are you known for?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  That's what I'm asking.  You're the one that approached me to try and label what I guess I do best, or what I can do better, or what.  But I'm trying to, I'm trying to label this in terms of me.
Speaker 1: Well, let me ask you this.  How do you think you'll be remembered?  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As I am remembered now.  Remember me as I am now.  Whatever you think of me now is how I would like to be remembered.  And that is, evidently, you think something of me to be interviewing me.  If so, then I would like for it to come forth and remain the better, to overshadow whatever difficulties there may be.  And that's the only way I can answer that.
Speaker 1: What's been most important to you in your life?
Speaker 2: Living (laughter).
Speaker 1: When people talk about Coach Bennett, what do you think they say?  When people ask your former athletes, "What kind of coach was Coach Bennett?" what do you think they say?
Speaker 2: I just had a revelation.  Homecoming.  At least forty or fifty athletes came to my house.  I must have given them something, or I must have been, I must have inspired them in some way to their success, wherever they are now, for them to return and have what they call a get-together.  That's why you have what they call Homecoming and so forth.  So I don't know, I just--I think that the way you make an individual feel is success.  If that individual is successful in any facts of life, then that individual gets some type of satisfaction.  And it registers with that individual, in terms of however we are made up of.  And they, in turn, get a certain reaction or feeling that develops for that individual.  And that's about the only way that I can put it, is that we're trying to get as much success out of individuals, and development, as we go along.  Each person is developed in terms of their attitude towards person or thing.

Speaker 1: What advice do you have for someone who wants to go into the coaching profession?
Speaker 2: Go into it.  But set some, I think you need to set a set of standards and codes for that individual to consider when going into a competitive atmosphere.  You can be the opposite and do the opposite and sometimes be successful, but not--how do I want to put that--be successful, and not thought of in terms of being good for the sport or being good for the individual.  That's the only way I can answer that, in terms of my concept.
Speaker 1: Do you think that coaching, would you recommend that as a profession?
Speaker 2: Do I--
Speaker 1: Would you recommend coaching as a profession?
Speaker 2: Yes, providing the individual stays within the rules and regulations of that particular sport or activity--I think that as long as you stay within the standards or the rights of that particular sport.  If not, you know what happens.  See, you've got organizations, you've got all types of organizations now that control the action and behavior of sports.
