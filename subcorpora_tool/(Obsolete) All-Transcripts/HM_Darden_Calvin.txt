Speaker 1: Okay sir, would you begin by telling us the name of your parents?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Grover Darden, my mother was Jessie Darden.  They're both deceased now.
Speaker 1: And the name of siblings in birth order?
Speaker 2: Genevieve, that's my oldest sister, followed by Lenora Darden, they're all Darden, they're all married.  Do you want their married names?
Speaker 1: Yes, please.
Speaker 2: Genevieve Millinder and it's Lenora Hamilton, Denise Wooten and my brother Raymond Darden, Don Darden.
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your ancestors?  Do you know who they were?
Speaker 2: I know grandparents on both sides.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Could you tell us their names?
Speaker 2: On my father's side it was Columbus [Darden] and Hattie Darden and on my mother's side it was Anthony [Gross] and Naomi Gross, my mother's parents.
Speaker 1: Do you know anything about their ethnicity and if they were enslaved or free?
Speaker 2: They were free.
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: My grandfather was born 1897, so I would think he was just on the--he died in 1955.  My grandmother was born 1898 she died in '59 [1959], so they're both relatively young when they passed away.  That's on my father's side.
Speaker 1: Okay, any remembrances from your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Actually, I'm sorry, that was on my mother's side, my father's side, I'm not sure of their birthdates, but they both died when I was very young.
Speaker 1: Okay, are there any stories, legends or songs that have been passed down through your family that you recall?
Speaker 2: I think the same values that were instilled in my parents they instilled in us and they often talked about those same values coming from their parents; values like integrity, dependability, persistence, those--that's a legacy in the family.
Story_ID: 158754
Speaker 1: What are your earliest memories from your childhood?
Speaker 2: Earliest, running to meet my father [Grover Darden] when he came from work.  I was probably five or six years old, maybe a little bit younger.  I can remember that.
Speaker 1: Could you describe each of your parents individually?
Speaker 2: Right, my father's 6'5" about 280 [pounds] said what he meant--meant what he said.  There were seven children, I had a brother that passed away in 1990, but there's still six of us that are living so.  He was the home--he was the bread winner, my mother [Jessie Darden] was the homemaker, she never worked 'cause she had seven children to take care of.  But my father did a great job, he spent a lot of time with us, especially with, with the males of the family, we went hunting every Saturday in the winter and fishing every Saturday in the summer and he taught us home remodeling and how to do those different type things. And my mother worked with my sisters, she taught them everything that they should know.
Speaker 1: Where are your parents from?
Speaker 2: My father was born in Coaling, Alabama which is just south of Birmingham near Bessemer.  My mother was born in Evergreen, Alabama which is down a little further south.
Speaker 1: Do you know where their parents were from, their birth places?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Can you describe your parents through any stories that you recall?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) that's hundreds.  My parents were very religious we went to church every Sunday, whether you wanted to or not--you didn't have a choice.  I think that's very, very important that they instilled the religious side in us and they taught us Christianity at a very young age.  I think that's very important I did the exact same thing with my children also.  And they still go to church, most every Sunday, my son will miss one or two here, he's twenty-nine years old but my other two girls will go, not only on Sunday's but also through the week, and I think that's very important on the religious side.  But both of my parents they did an exceptional job and my father taught us to work hard, he taught us to stay out of trouble, none of the six children ever been arrested, seven in fact, with my brother that passed away.  Because he always said, "If you got to jail you'll be down there, I'm not coming to get you," and I know he meant that so none of us tried it.  Also, if you got in trouble it would be trouble to pay at the end so (laughter) that, that just wouldn't work.  And my mother always took care of the home, did an exceptional job with seven children, keeping the home clean she always cooked meals every day, including Saturdays and Sundays.  And continued to teach the values that I think are very, very important.

Speaker 1: --Are there any sights, sounds or smells that you recall from growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights, sounds or smells, sure.  Sights, sounds, or smells, meaning what, what exactly?  Sights like?
Speaker 1: Sights could be walking down your neighborhood street, if you--if there was a particular theater that you and your siblings would go to for movies, what it was like where that theater was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --there was a park or, you know, a neighborhood kind of place where people met.
Speaker 2: We went to the Apollo in Buffalo, New York.  There was an Apollo Theatre on the--it was on Jefferson Avenue, right near Glenwood.  We lived at 23 Glenwood so, we went there quite often.  The big park was Como Park C-O-M-O, was out in Cheektowaga, New York so we would go out there, normally a couple a times a month, have family days--family gatherings, picnics, basketball, frisbee, those type things.
Speaker 1: Are there any (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Hula hoop was big back then.  I could do it then, I can't do it now, wouldn't even try (laughter), you wouldn't remember that, oh, you do?  Good.
Speaker 1: What about sounds, or smells?
Speaker 2: No, nothing that stands out as far as sounds or smells. Smells, good cooking (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I was--
Speaker 2: My mother [Jessie Darden] was a great cook.  Could always smell that food long before you got in the door.
Story_ID: 158756
Speaker 1: What type of child were you?
Speaker 2: Bad little rascal.  Well, let everybody else tell it I was bad.  Very inquisitive, I would have a God-given talent to fix things always worked on things.  My father [Grover Darden] did mechanic work also. He had to find ways to supplement the income when you have seven children runnin' around so he taught me mechanic work, so I still do that now.  I do brakes on the cars etcetera when I get time.  But I was always very inquisitive, I asked a lot of questions, I wanted to learn different things.  I wanted to do different things but never got in any trouble.  So, I think I was okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: What were your dreams and aspirations?
Speaker 2: One thing I did, I was being inquisitive one day, my mother [Jessie Darden] had a beautiful set of china in a beautiful buffet and there was something I wanted that was on the top of this buffet so, being the bad little kid that I was, I climbed up on the window and I jumped up on the side of this china closet and I reached for whatever, and the whole thing came down and broke all of her dishes, her finest china.  I guess that's the kinda (laughter) kid I was.  That wasn't a good day around the house.
Speaker 1: No, how did she respond?
Speaker 2: She was not happy at all, to put it very mildly.
Story_ID: 158757
Speaker 1: And your dreams and aspirations when you were a child?  What did you dream (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I wanted to be a police officer.
Speaker 1: --of becoming?  Okay.
Speaker 2: That was my dream to become a police officer and help people.  Answer calls, that's what I wanted--the only thing that prevented me from becoming a police officer was--so this is almost thirty-five years ago, is you had to have perfect twenty-twenty vision you couldn't wear glasses, contacts weren't out at that time so, I wouldn't have been able to pass the test on the vision side.
Story_ID: 158758
Speaker 1: What was it like growing up in your hometown of Buffalo [New York]?
Speaker 2: Buffalo was a--I would say when I was growing up, an average city.  I think right now it's somewhat depressed as far as I'm concerned.  I think a lot of businesses have left Buffalo, but it was a great city.  I went through all the school there, I went to elementary school, middle school, high school and college in Buffalo, New York.  But when I go back and I compare it to Atlanta [Georgia], there's no comparison Buffalo versus Atlanta.  Atlanta's far ahead of Buffalo.  But I go back there a lot. I work with Canisius College [Buffalo, New York] on their board of trustees now.  That's where I receive my undergraduate studies at--my degree from Canisius College.  So they asked me to join their board of trustees so I did last year.  So, I have to go back four times a year whether I want to or not.  But I go back anyway, still have a lot of relatives in Buffalo.
Speaker 1: What was the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But I remember, it was a good city, but I remember the riots in '66 [1966].  I was sixteen years old and we lived on house off of Maine Street in Buffalo and just to see all of the destruction and everything that was going on, me sitting right there on the front porch was, was quite an experience.
Speaker 1: What was the community like that you were raised in?
Speaker 2: Eighty percent African American, twenty percent Caucasian.  And then those numbers, of course, started to turn as, as time went on and became more and more African American in the area that we lived in, 'til it was close to a hundred--not a hundred, but there were still families that I remember that still lived in, in that area when I left Buffalo which was like 1980 or '81 [1981].
Story_ID: 158759
Speaker 1: You mentioned attending church with your family when you were growing up, where did you attend church and what was that like?
Speaker 2: Well as a youngster, I wasn't quite sure why I should be there but again, we weren't given a choice.  But we were--we lived about five minutes from the church.  It was Greater Hope Baptist Church on Verplanck Avenue in Buffalo, New York.  And we were there for many, many years and then probably late teens we actually start going to the Church of God in Christ [COGIC], which is a different denomination, that's what I'm in now, Church of God in Christ.  But it was good, it was a good experience.  I enjoyed Sunday school because you can really learn more about the bible, so I figured since you had to go, and I wasn't jumping up volunteering every Sunday, but again you didn't have a choice.  I understood that, I thought that was very helpful, Y.P. which is Young Peoples Willing Workers, Y.P.W.W. which was done on Sunday afternoons, was also very helpful.  And there were always activities at church, my father [Grover Darden] was on the deacon board, my mother [Jessie Darden] was in the choir and it goes on from there.
Story_ID: 158760
Speaker 1: Are there any personal experiences that you enjoy sharing related to your life?
Speaker 2: There's thousands of those, on the personal experience side, I appreciate the upbringing that I had.  We didn't have an awful lot of money, that's why my parents [Jessie Darden and Grover Darden] really taught us that an education would be very, very important in this world, and out of seven children, six did graduate from college.  My brother, even though he was--although he was on a full scholarship, decided after his sophomore year that he wasn't going to return, I did get him to return for a while, but then he dropped out again.  So, they taught us that that was very important that you earn--get a degree and earn a good living.  So that was very important.
Speaker 1: Are there any other values or ways in which your parents impacted who you've become today, things that they extended to you?
Speaker 2: They, they practiced what they preached and I think that was very, very important, it wasn't like they were telling us something and they would do something different.  I have people laughing all the time because we had to go to bed at 8:30 every night, maybe that's why I go to bed early now and get up at three or four in the morning.  Because I think, and I didn't understand it at that time, that they thought that you don't have to worry about going in the streets if you're in the bed at 8:30 and ready for school early the next day, those type things.  So, those values were important, my parents never used profanity, which I think is very, very important so, I abhor profanity now.  I just don't think it's right that people should swear.  We were never able to use the word "lie," ever, nor can my children use that today.  They won't ever say the word, "lie," they may say tale, story, untruth, but not the word "lie," that was taught to me by my parents.  We were also taught to help each other, when you have six brothers and sisters you have to learn to depend on each other starting from the oldest on down and my mother and father--I could still hear them saying, you now, "Always help your brothers and sisters, whether they're older or younger, you always must work together and help each other in whatever way that it's needed."  I think that was very important also.
Story_ID: 158761
Speaker 1: Where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: I went to Public School 16 [P.S. 16], in Buffalo, New York and I went there from--actually kindergarten through the eighth grade.  And then I went to Woodlawn Junior High School [Buffalo, New York] for just one year, the ninth grade, and this was a, was a school where, where children were bused in from different areas and it was quite an experience.  There were probably ten to fifteen fights every day at this school for whatever reason.  It was a tough, tough school, Woodlawn Junior High School, and what had to end up happening is the non-minority, non-African Americans were allowed to leave like forty-five minutes before school was out just to, to go home because there was were more fights outside for whatever reason.  Tough school when you're  bring children in from all different angles, I mean all different areas and having different problems it was, it was tough.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I only lived two blocks away from there so, just walked home.
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: Great student, I was in all honors classes, all the way through really, elementary school.  Then at Woodlawn Junior High School and then I took college entrance classes all through high school, and then college.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the teachers that you remember?
Speaker 2: I remember homeroom--well actually, I remember my kindergarten teacher, believe it or not.  Her name was Miss Mosedale, M-O-S-E-D-A-L-E.  I remember my first grade teacher, her name was Mrs. Walsh [ph.].  I don't remember any of the other teachers (laughter) until I got up a few years.  But I remember both of them very vividly. I can still picture them now.
Story_ID: 158762
Speaker 1: My mother [Jessie Darden] had a set of photographs as they take school pictures when I was in kindergarten or first grade and I was the only black student out of probably twenty students.  And the reason I make note of that is because still when you look around we're not nearly to where we should be and that, that concerns me a little bit sometimes.  When you look around, I don't pay an awful lot of attention to it, but sometimes you look around, if you look at the management committee, I'm the only African American on the management committee.  Now that's due to change, so, I'm saying, okay, fifty-four years later how much has really changed?  That is not an indictment of UPS [United Parcel Service] or anyone else, but that's just a thought that I sometimes think about.  Now we have other people that are--going to--going to come up at UPS and, I mean, we'll change those numbers and if you look out in the ranks we've done a remarkable job, but that just something that stuck to me and that I think about sometimes.
Story_ID: 158763
Speaker 1: And who were you going to mention in terms of those who influenced you in these earlier years, coming from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Definitely my parents [Jessie Darden and Grover Darden]--
Speaker 1: --elementary to secondary? (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --it was, we were always taught to stay away from trouble makers, and you could tell when you're going to school the, the three different type students.  Those who're trying to get ahead, those that were trouble makers and those who're just middle of the road and we were always taught to stay away from those that were going to cause trouble.  My mother and father believed in guilt by association, if you're hanging out with the wrong students or the wrong youngsters then you're going to be looked on in the same light.  If they were going to get into trouble, then you would be just as guilty as they would be.
Story_ID: 158764
Speaker 1: How did you spend your time in these early years?  What kinds of things were you doing--books, were there particular (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I would always--
Speaker 1: --books you read?
Speaker 2: Well, I loved to read, but I would always get my homework done and then I'd find something to tinker with, I was always tinkering with things and fixing things.  I still do that now, that's relaxation for me, or little building projects or fixing things.  So I would do things like that, if something didn't work around the house I would try to fix it, it would either get better or I'd just blow it up or whatever would happen to it (laughter).  A couple electric shocks trying to learn electrical work (laughter) things like that.
Speaker 1: How did you entertain yourself, what kind of things did you do for leisure?
Speaker 2: I loved fishing, and as I said earlier, we would go hunting in the winter.  But I really loved fishing, I went fishing last week at a management conference.  Bass fishing, I caught three, if that matters (laughter).
Story_ID: 158765
Speaker 1: Did you participate in any sports?
Speaker 2: Played basketball in high school.  I didn't do--in college I was on the precision drill team which took all of my time.  Other than school you were doing drill practice.  I have a bayonet wound on my arm where one of the gentlemen took a wrong turn one day and tore my whole shirt off with the bayonet and put a nice little three inch gash on my elbow.  And folks used to think we used rubber bayonets, they knew then that were not rubber, those are regular steel bayonets that we used.  So, that took all my time in college other than studies.  I was on the drill team for four years ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] and commissioned as a second lieutenant when I graduated.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: Lafayette High School [Buffalo, New York].
Speaker 1: Was Lafayette in Buffalo, New York, as well?--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Buffalo, right
Speaker 1: Okay and you matriculated from Lafayette to Cassius [sic]?
Speaker 2: Canisius--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Canisius College [Buffalo, New York]?
Speaker 2: Right
Speaker 1: And so in that matriculation there were many things going on socially, are there any things that you recall in particular that marked your, your era?
Speaker 2: One thing, back on the parents [Jessie Darden and Grover Darden], my parents could not have afforded to put us so school, so my mother always talked about getting good grades in school so that you could win a scholarship and that's exactly what we did we--I won a scholarship.  I was awarded a full scholarship at Canisius College.  It paid books, fees and tuition, an academic scholarship, and so did my brothers and sisters.  They all did well on that.
Speaker 1: So in college did you participate in any social movements, were you on any particular committees, were you a member of a fraternity or any clubs?
Speaker 2: Well, the club was the drill team, that took, that took all the time, but the debate club, I was on the, on the debate club.  We did, we did--there would be gatherings at the school that we would go to, TGIF Friday's, those type things.  But this drill team there was a lot of travel also, you had to travel to different cities and states and do drill meets.  It was a full-time job in and of itself.  But there were always other things that I did also at school.
Story_ID: 158766
Speaker 1: So when did you meet your wife [Patricia Gail Darden]?
Speaker 2: Actually my wife and I--I met her in high school [Lafayette High School, Buffalo, New York].  That's where I first met her at, and then we got married when I was starting my senior year at Canisius College [Buffalo, New York] and I had just--it was actually a month before I started, UPS [United Parcel Service] incidentally.  She actually referred me to UPS for this job.  Because we got married, we were married on August 21st of '71 [1971].  And then I started UPS September 21st '71 [1971].  I didn't know you were supposed to work when you got married, I mean, for crying out loud nobody told me all those type things.  So I went to work.  I went to work part-time unloading trailers for $3.00 an hour.  I worked three hours a day, I grossed $45.00 a week and my paycheck was $36.00 a week.  That was the money we bought grocery with. She worked full-time at Wassaic State School.  That's how we paid the rent and bills until I graduated from college the following May. Then I started full-time at UPS.
Speaker 1: And that began your career here?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It's been said you haven't missed a day of work, could you explain how in the past twenty-two years?
Speaker 2: Thirty-three years.
Speaker 1: Thirty-three, 'scuse me, thirty-three years?
Speaker 2: Never missed a sick day never had an unplanned absence.
Speaker 1: Amazing.
Speaker 2: My children do the same thing.  I don't remember them ever missing a day from school all the way through school.  I would incent them, I'd say, "If you go to school, don't miss a day I'll give you $100.00 at the end of the year."  So I gave them 100 one dollar bills, they'd thought they hit the lottery or something, but they went to school every day.  They go to work every day now.
Story_ID: 158767
Speaker 1: So can you detail for us your professional life here at UPS [United Parcel Service]?  You started out, as you mentioned, unloading, how did you progress from there?
Speaker 2: I started off unloading trailers.  I'd actually planned to work at UPS for eight or nine months and then when I graduated I was going to leave UPS and go to work full-time somewhere.  When I graduated in May of '72 [1972], they offered me a full-time hub position.  I was working out in the hub, that's where we unload, sort take the package from one trailer sort them, put them into another trailer.  They had a full-time position, actually at that time UPS had a rule that once you graduated from college you couldn't work at UPS any longer as a part-timer.  So if there were no full-time jobs available you had to quit.  That was to keep the students coming in getting their education and moving on.  But we had a full-time job so I started working full-time in the hub.  That was in--when I graduated, I worked out in the hub as a run out belt supervisor, then a--and this was part-time to full-time.  And then I was a primary supervisor and then I was promoted to the hub manager, that was in 1976 I was promoted to hub manager.  I did that job for two years and then transferred to the package side in November of '78 [1978] as a package, package center manager.  Had about a hundred drivers that I was responsible for out of Buffalo [New York].  Did that assignment for about eight months and then I picked up the hub and feeder operation in addition to the package job.  So, I ran hub feeder--feeder to tractor trailer units that run up and down the highways.  So I had hub, feeder and the package side, had that for a year and I went to teach supervisor basic training school, which is SBTS, it's what we called it back then.  I taught the last class of 1980 and the first two of '81 [1981].  Came back to Buffalo for about four months and was transferred to Nashville [Tennessee].  Moved out of Nashville as a Nashville hub division manager, stayed there for two years, made some great gains, I took a hub--I'll never forget it, I was being interviewed by two region managers and the hub that I took over was running 60 to 65 percent effective and they said, "Do you think you can make gains in this hub?" and I said, "Oh, absolutely."  But inside, something was saying, "Are you nuts, are you crazy?  This thing has been running 60 percent effective for ten years.  What makes you think you can make a difference?"  So they gave me the hub and in two year period we had all three sorts.  That's a day (unclear) and night sort running at 100 percent effective which had never, ever happened before.  And that was taking--that was my first experience out of Buffalo, but it's taking this large hub and any large problems broken--just break it down into small problems, and just one by one you fix those small problems and when you look around the whole thing has been fixed.  And that's the premise that I've always used at UPS, no matter how bad it looks, how large it looks, it's still comprised of a bunch of small little issues or small problems and you have to fix those.  So I stayed there for two years and then I was transferred to Memphis [Tennessee].  Went to Memphis as a package division manager, stayed there for nine months, made some tremendous gains.  Memphis was a tough area and I was told probably by ten or twelve people that--don't go to Memphis it will be the end of your career, nobody survives in Memphis--da-da-da-da-da.  And I was actually given a choice by the--their district manager, and he said, "You can stay here in Nashville as a package division manager or you can go to Memphis."  And I said, Memphis before he finished asking me.  He said, "Why Memphis?"  I said, "I just don't believe that it has to run as badly as it runs."  'Cause I was there for--I'd been in Nashville for two years and it's all you hear is, everything negative about Memphis.  So I went to Memphis and, that only took about six weeks to really fix that place and we broke all sorts of records and we took it from an hour over division to scratch meaning that all the drivers go out and if you're giving them 8.2 hours work they get it done in 8.2 or less, and that had never been done before.  So at the age of thirty-four I was promoted to district manager.  I moved up to North Jersey [New Jersey], that's in Parsippany, Jersey.  Stayed there for two years as a district manager and then transferred to Secaucus, which is Metro Jersey.  Stayed there for five years as a district manager and that was our largest hub at that time 60,000 packages per hour.  We could process through, through the hub and another 30,000 through the small sort that we were able to do, and I had that job for five years.  Had to work on a lot of problems, complete difference between North Jersey and Metro Jersey although it was all UPS.  And then I was transferred to Metro [Washington] D.C., went down there for two years as the Metro D.C. district manager.  Stayed there and after the two years, I was promoted to vice president region manager and I moved to California had the--what's called the Pacific region which was Southern California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Idaho and Hawaii, and I said, "Okay, when it gets that bad, just book a meeting to Hawaii and go there."
Story_ID: 158768
Speaker 1: I was promoted to Pacific region managers and vice-president, so moved to California. I had Southern California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, and Hawaii, as my responsibility.  I stayed there for two years and then, let's see, January of '95 [1995], came to corporate office as our strategic quality coordinator.  My job at that time was to take quality to a new height at UPS [United Parcel Service].  We'd always been a quality company, but how do we take it up another notch and be ready for the 21st century and beyond?  So my job was to retrain 300,000 plus employees and make sure they all understood the direction that we were trying to take UPS in.  Had that assignment for two years and then [James P.] Jim Kelly, who was the CEO at that time asked me if I would come back into operations and take  half of the U.S. operations, and that was in '97 [1997], fall of '97 [1997].  Did that for two years and then he asked me if I would take the entire country and that's what I have now all of the operations in the U.S. It encompasses 320,000 people it is comprised of seven regions, it was eleven but we've dissolved four regions--combined to get down to seven and it's comprised of fifty-five districts, that represent the 320,000 people.

Speaker 1: Can you describe your adult life in terms of your family? Rearing your children, are there any memories or things that you feel passionately about as a father?
Speaker 2: Sure, the same values that were instilled in me, I think you will find those same values in my children.  My son is twenty-nine, he is the vice-president at AIC [Ameritas Investment Corp.] which is an investment company.  They're just in the process of opening up here in the U.S. so he's going to run their North American division here, it started about six months ago and he's doing extremely well.  He--my oldest daughter lives in Canton, Michigan.  Her and her husband and my granddaughter, she works at KPMG as a people soft consultant, and her husband is at Rockwell Automation [Inc.].  And my youngest daughter is still at home, I'm still trying to pry her out.  She just turned twenty-five, said she's never leaving, couldn't wait for the other two to go.  And she is a consultant at Deloitte, she works downtown Atlanta [Georgia] here, and is doing very well.  These children moved seven times around the country and I always hear parents say, "Well, my child, you know, I had to leave one here, one there."  Mine always came they stuck right (laughter) with us all the way through, 'til my some went off to college, he went to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] here in Atlanta while we were living in California.  So they've done very well--children have done very well, again never been in any trouble, no drugs none of those type things.  I think it's very important.  My youngest daughter, well, actually both my daughters, they will always read their Bible before they go to sleep at night, you can go into their bedrooms and you'll see right on the nightstand.  Son, little different--daughters, they love to read the Bible--go to church.  But they've--we're very proud of those--and I especially appreciate my wife [Patricia Gail Darden] because I traveled so much that she pretty much had to raise the children and teach them all the things that they needed to know.

Speaker 1: What are some challenges that you recall in your professional life with your traveling or just in general?
Speaker 2: Challenge is to--the greatest challenge is to find a balance between what you're trying to do, between the professional side, your business, and the personal side.  And I always thought that was very, very important.  If you're not careful you'll find that you're, you're spending 99.5 percent of your time at work or work related activities and very little family time.  So, what I did way back when my children were very young is we always spent Saturdays, all day Saturdays together as a family doing something; we still do that now with my younger daughter the other two, course one lives in New York  and one lives in Michigan.  But we still do that right now, and then church on Sundays.  So you will have a hard time getting me to do something on a Saturday, hard time, it's almost impossible.
Speaker 1: What kind of activities do you all do on the Saturdays as a family?
Speaker 2: Well my wife [Patricia Gail Darden], anything that says shopping she would love to do that, so they could even talk me into the mall sometimes.  While they're shopping I'll just go down and sit at the mall and people watch, or check voice mails on the phone or something on the cell phone.  But we like to do that, she'll go with me to different shows, like we went to the car show, we'll do some things like that that they have here in Atlanta, or go visit some friends.  Go to breakfast, go to lunch, go to dinner, she won't cook on Saturdays, she cooks Monday through Friday and Sundays.  So those are some of the things that we do.

Speaker 1: Can you describe any memorable events from your professional life, are there any awards that you've received or?
Speaker 2: There are many; every time I was promoted, it was like a new dream to me.  When you go from being a part-time supe [superintendent] to a full-time supe, which was great.  From a full-time supervisor to a manager which is magnificent.  To become a district manager at thirty-four years of age was unheard of and this was 1984 when I was promoted and I remember giving a speech, my first speech at a management conference and when I said I was thirty-four years old it was like a hush fell over the audience like, who is this little young kid, this little young whippersnapper that thinks he can run a district at thirty-four years old, which was great.  And then district manager, from district manager to region manager, from region manager to, to quality and the job that I have now were all great and then when [James P.] Jim Kelly asked me to join the board of directors that probably was the greatest moment in my career.
Speaker 1: How did it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: --you feel?  That he asked--(simultaneous)--right.
Speaker 2: Magnificent, magnificent, it was, it was something that I had hoped for but my premise is you keep your head low and you keep sawing wood--I tell folks that every day.  Just keep focusing on the job that you're doing right now, do it to the best of your ability and then better things will always come along.  Because if you become distracted and focus too much on the next job you spend more time worrying about the next job than getting your job done that you presently have, and that will never work.
Story_ID: 158772
Speaker 1: What would you say has been the best thing about working for UPS [United Parcel Service] for the past thirty-three years?
Speaker 2: The best thing is the accomplishments that I've made and I give all the credit for that to God first, I think we don't get anywhere without some divine intervention.  So just the accomplishments and to be able-- UPS is a unique company in that you're given the autonomy to make the decisions that you have to make.  So I hear people saying, well I want to be an entrepreneur and then I think and say, "Well, I'm an entrepreneur," because at UPS, UPS breaks off your little part and says, "You go run this part" what happ--which happens to be your company and your business.  Now the greatest part 'bout it is if you make a wrong decision you still have a multi-billion dollar company standing behind you.  So you get to be an entrepreneur, use your own mind, make your own gains, but if you stumble you have this tremendous company that stands behind you and backs you up and gets you right back on track.  So that UPS is the best of all worlds anyway you want to look at it.  So you can be an entrepreneur, you could run your own company, but again you have all the safeguards in place that should something go wrong their standing right there to help you out.  And although there's 360--almost 370,000 people now, UPS is really one big family, that's really what it comes down to, all over this world.
Story_ID: 158773
Speaker 1: Have there ever been times that you recall where things have gone wrong?
Speaker 2: Hundreds, maybe thousands (laughter).
Speaker 1: Could you share one of those (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It's--
Speaker 1: --experiences maybe, and how you handled it?
Speaker 2: If you believe in what you're trying to get done, you will go home some days totally frustrated because whatever you worked on didn't get better or it got worse, something that you tried to fix.  When I, when I speak to younger supervisors and managers I say every day when you go home you should be able to know in your mind that you made a positive difference on something at work today.  Now that doesn't mean that something should've gotten worse, but because you were there today and you touched and fixed something, that should be your measurement when you go home.  If you go home at the end of the day and you can't reach back and talk about or touch one thing that you made better then you're spinning your wheels here at UPS [United Parcel Service].  So there's, there's many things you get, you get discouraged sometimes you second guess yourselves not just me, but when you're, when you're talking in a group of people, when you make decisions about a person's livelihood, that's a tough decision.  And I always want to--speak to group says, how do you know that you would make the same decision today as you would tomorrow or the next day.  What if you got up this morning and nothing went right, you're running late, you can't get your hair done correctly, car won't start and all those things and you have to come in today and make a, an important decision as to whether this person works at UPS any longer or not, would you make the exact same decision today as you would tomorrow where everything went smooth and you weren't agitated or aggravated before you got to work?  The answer to that had better be yes, but that's a tough one.  You have to be able to look and remove yourself and get all the emotions out and make the best decision that's necessary.
Story_ID: 158774
Speaker 1: What awards are you the most proud of that you've received?
Speaker 2: I think the recognition of the Fortune magazine is probably number one.  When the Fortune article comes out and they said, "Well, you're ranked number eight out of the fifty most powerful black executives in the United States," I said, "Wow, I am?"  Didn't feel like it, but, and then you get these phone calls saying, well you're, you're higher than Oprah [Winfrey].  I said, "Well, I work harder than Oprah," she has more money, but I work harder (laughter) than Oprah works.  But that was, that was a great recognition, I give a lot of credit to Peggy Gardner who worked tirelessly on that and a whole bunch of other people that helped out but I think that was the greatest recognition and then several other magazines that I've been in, Ebony, this Men Looking Ahead magazine, Atlanta Journal it's been, it's been great.  It's recognition also that I don't, I really don't think I deserve.  I don't think I've, I don't think I've done any more than most UPS [United Parcel Service] have.  I really don't because UPS is a company filled with hard-working people, hard-working people.  But I thank God I was singled out and--but I don't know if I deserve all that sometimes.
Story_ID: 158775
Speaker 1: It's been said that you feel very strongly about leadership and the development of leadership, could you discuss with us some of your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --concepts around that?
Speaker 2: The analogy that I use is thirty-three years ago the former generation handed a baton to me, that baton happened to be UPS [United Parcel Service].  And when I, when I walk out whatever time that is and I hand to the next generation I should hand to them a stronger UPS than was handed to me when I pass that baton off.  And I want to know for sure that I've done all that I could do to make sure that I'm building now that next generation of leaders that are out there right now.  If not, although I hand them a stronger UPS then it's going to start to fall apart if you don't 'have the right people in those positions.  So, not just me, but we start way back.  We look--maybe it's a twenty year process in bringing folks all the way up from part-time to become district managers, region managers and management committee members.  It's a long evolving cycle where you, you talk to people you mentor them.  You praise them when you do well--when they do well and you tell them when they don't do well.  That's a, that's very, very important.  My job doesn't end, if you ask my wife [Patricia Gail Darden], when I go home.  It doesn't end 'cause then the phone starts to ring because you get questions from all over the U.S. about how I should handle this or how I should handle that.  Being the highest ranking authority at UPS people, especially African Americans think you know all the answers so they don't mind calling and I don't mind answering the questions.  I will tell them when they're right but I'll surely tell them when they're wrong also.  I will do that, I think that's important but it takes, it takes working together in order to make that happen.
Story_ID: 158776
Speaker 1: What is an example of an instance where you took an unfavorable position?  Someone came to you thinking you would support an idea or a perspective that they had when you didn't?
Speaker 2: I'll get a call--this is probably two months ago, a person that was in trouble being reprimanded or suspended or discharged for absenteeism for example.  And the first thing people say to me is, "I'm being discriminated against."  And this was an African American individual. Incidentally, I can't remember an example of someone being really discriminated against when they said they were.  I don't remember any such thing, so it's very simple I ask a bunch a small questions.  Okay, you say you're being discriminated against for--and you're being discharged for being absent?  Well, it's very, very simple. Did you come to work every day that you were supposed to come to work or not?  And then the answer has to be, no.  Okay, then I'm not sure you were discriminated against, so how many days did you miss?  Well, I missed five days in a thirty day period--and you wonder why you're in trouble, you didn't come to work five--but I had this problem, I had that problem and I this problem.  That doesn't matter, because at UPS you have to come to work every day.  When I was working out in the hub if I wasn't standing there at 5:15 to start the belts every day, who would turn the belts on?  And that's the way the system works at UPS [United Parcel Service], everyone has their own individual job, own individual responsibilities.  So when I finished with this young man, he saw that he hadn't been discriminated against and if he had he was only discriminated against by himself.  Nobody else had discriminated against.  Either you're at work or you're not.  If you're not at work you might think you have a legitimate excuse and maybe you do, but you're not there, so you're still absent.  And that's one example, so he had a different opinion when we were done talking.  And he's gotten his job back, he's back to work and you don't hear anything else from him.
Story_ID: 158777
Speaker 1: Are there any causes that you've championed in your professional life?
Speaker 2: Sure the one--one of which I'm most proud of is the BEEP program which is the Black Executive Exchange Program that we have here at UPS [United Parcel Service].  And we started back 1990, I was on a special assignment in the corporate office and I sat down with some official from the National Urban League, Renee DeJong was one and we talked about bringing the BEEP program into UPS.  So I've been one of the sponsors of the BEEP program, and we have about 125 of our top managers that are all college graduates and we go out and we spend times at schools, we stand in front of classrooms and we talk about what it takes to be successful in the business world.  And we tell them it is no joke out here so here's what you should be on guard for, we talk to our young men about not having police records and statistics say that 72 percent of our black males between the ages of thirteen and twenty-two will have some scrape with the law, some of which will end up with police records and I say police records will follow you for the rest of your life.  I don't care who says what, there's not a Fortune 500, 100 or 50 company that is not going to run your background.  And I say to them, "Now if you put on the application that you, you do have a felony, for example, you're not going to get hired.  If you put on there that you don't and the company finds out that you do, what do you think you're going to be discharged for?"  And they say, "For falsifying the application," I say, "That's exactly right.  You will be discharged for falsifying the application," and I say, "If you had a little trouble in school, you did something wrong, went brain dead for a minute, you can write that off for temporary insanity.  But a consistent line of some type of police problems that's not going to be tolerated anywhere."  We talk to the young ladies about not having babies out of wedlock, only 13 percent go on to graduate.  And if we are going to get to where we should, education is going to be one of the keys.  We talk to--talk to them about taking the right courses, I say to the young men, "We don't need you to take a woodworking course, that's not going to help you get through this college."  We don't need our young ladies to take homemaking courses, the mom can teach you that at home, the dad can teach you woodworking we need you to take math, science, history, good skills, understand how to speak, those are the type things, language skills that's what we talk to them about at these schools.  The other thing I say to those students, the same, the same patterns you set right now--if right now you get up, you don't want to go to school parents have to push you out of the house every morning you come you do just enough to get by then what do you think is going to happen you graduate on Friday somehow, what do you think is going to happen Monday in the business world?  The only difference is it's not going to be tolerated in the business world.  You pay your tuition whether you come to school or not, some care some don't, what's the big deal you're just wasting your money.  But in the business world you're going to be expected to come to work, come every day and do a great job and we stand there and we talk to these students about that.  That, that I think is very, very important so I say, you can't--if you've been missing class and doing all these things you can't just hit a switch on Monday an say guess what I fixed all of that and now I'm ready for the business world, it doesn't work like that.  So the same patterns being established through grade school, high school and college are the same ones that will come into the business world.
Story_ID: 158778
Speaker 1: What messages or lessons do you have that you would share?
Speaker 2: I tell most people, keep your head down and keep sawing wood.  I think that's very, very important.  I don't have time for, for gossip. I don't get involved in that I just don't have time.  And I think you keep working hard at the job that you do.  The, the other thing that I want to mention is that I talk to the students about is I have a theory ca--I call pay me now, pay me later and every single person in this world will pay now or you will pay later.  Every single person I don't care who you are or what you do.  And that, that's one of the thing I bring up, not just to the folks at UPS but also when we're out to these BEEP [Black Executive Exchange Program] schools.  Now how do you pay now, you pay now by digging in studying hard getting good grades, graduating from college, hopefully, in, in many cases possible going for the master's degree or the doctorate degree.  That's how you're paying the system now, great education, great job; you can have a happy lifestyle.  You pay later by not doing any of those things, so you don't graduate and you don't get a good job.  You'll end up making a menial $8.00 or $9.00 an hour and you'll struggle the rest of your life.  But you will pay now or you will pay later, and I do talk to them about that, think that's very, very important.
Story_ID: 158779
Speaker 1: Are there any other lessons that you think people need to be made aware of that you've learned that have helped you to become who you are?
Speaker 2: Yeah, not just, not just the working hard part but I think having a listening ear is extremely important.  Having a mentor or mentors is extremely important.  People that will save you some of the pitfalls that, that they had to go through, but you have to be able to listen.  You'll have to be able to take constructive criticism.  Or if someone tells you something you take it with a grain of salt but you don't deny or say well I'm not going to do that if there's somebody that you've actually--and when you mentor with someone, I mean you're saying, you're, you're trusting that person to give you the proper guidance to get to wherever you're trying to get to.  So you have to listen, sometimes a mentor has told me things that I didn't quite agree with, I mean I just --but you have to understand that it's like what our parents did growing up.  You didn't understand everything they said or did (cough) I said the same thing about having to go to bed at 8:30, I didn't understand that then, I do understand it now.  Because that was there way of keeping us all together as a family and making sure that nobody got in trouble 'cause most of the trouble happened at night anywhere with these youngsters roving up and down the streets or standing on the street corners etcetera.  So I say you have to be able to listen and don't be afraid of hard work.  This thing about coming in today a CEO replacing Mike [Michael L.] Eskew isn't it.  If I had to do it all over again at UPS [United Parcel Service], I'd do the exact same thing, I'd start unloading trailers at $3.00 an hour because now when I sit on a management committee and the board of directors, there isn't a job I don't know about 'cause I've done all those jobs on the operational side and most--I've done most of those jobs on the staff side.  Some work in IE [industrial engineering], some work in human resources side.  One thing about UPS, you have to have done the job to get credibility here.  I can't come in off the streets and be a good center manager or a good division manager, or how can you tell me a better way to deliver a package if you've never delivered a package, and that's important here at UPS.  So I would say--I would tell youngsters to spend time to find the company that you think you want to spend the rest of your career with.  And I don't care if I start in the mailroom, I'm going to be the best mailroom employee that they've ever had, and I'm going to work my way up from there.  All I want is the opportunity I want the toe hold to get in there and then I'll take it from there.  It takes a lot of hard work, coming to work every day, like I said earlier, come early, stay late but make a difference.  You don't just muddle and do just enough to get through.  All those different things are important and then people, people will appreciate what you do, they will understand you.  I think--and I talk to people a lot about doing a self-analysis.  If you are not comfortable speaking in front of a group, take Dale Carnegie courses, practice in front of a mirror, I don't care what, you have to be comfortable doing things like that.  Because if I can stand up, at a relatively young UPS career age, in front of a board of directors and all it takes, board of director member sitting around here and I stand at the podium and I do a presentation all it takes is for someone to say, he's pretty sharp, she's pretty sharp, maybe we should look at doing this, maybe we should look at doing that.  Well, if I didn't give that presentation, if I didn't volunteer to give that presentation if I didn't stand there and know what I was talking about then they would never know me and I could be the best person there is on earth stuck over there driving a package car somewhere.  So we have to be, we have to be cognizant of all those facts and not afraid to step out.  I've always taken on the toughest challenges, the toughest challenges.  People say, "Well why do you do that?"  I do that--first of all I love the challenge, and also I learned a long time ago as I said earlier, it's one large problem made up of a whole bunch of small problems.  And I always thought that I could make gains anywhere that I went, I guess, self-confidence is extremely important but I always thought that I could make gains.  And I've done that everywhere that I've gone.  So I wasn't afraid to do that, that's why when, when I was asked do you want to stay in Nashville [Tennessee] or go to Memphis [Tennessee], I said go to Memphis.  I just don't think it should run as bad as it runs.  So you can't be afraid to do that, I, I say to students and we lose students, incidentally, when you come to UPS what size uniform do you wear?  Why do I need a uniform?  Because you're going to go out and deliver packages, you're going to drive a package car.  Well, I didn't go to school for four years, or I didn't go get my master's degree to drive a truck.  Fine, that same door that you used coming in you should use going out because that's that same credibility thing that I'm talking about.  How can you supervise or manage a group of people on a job that you've never done?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So that's important, we do that right now, we'll send people out, you can have the highest education degree in the U.S. you still need to go out and deliver packages and understand the core part of the business, what UPS is really made of and then go from there.
Story_ID: 158780
Speaker 1: When you came to UPS [United Parcel Service], did you know then that you wanted to spend the rest of your professional career here?
Speaker 2: No, I'd only planned to stay here nine months.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was going to work from September until I graduated the following May and then I was going to go get a full-time job somewhere.  I never saw myself working here at UPS any longer than that, but also my first job was unloading trailers.  The one think I knew I was I wanted to be the best unloader that they had, even if it was just for nine months.  And I could unload trailers very, very fast and a lot days they had to put two sorters on me because one just couldn't keep up.
Speaker 1: At what time did you really begin to realize that UPS was going to be the place where you were going to climb the ranks?
Speaker 2: I remember having dinner with two division managers that were trying to talk me into coming into full-time management.  I wasn't quite sure I wanted to, at that point I was out as a package driver, I still think that's one of the greatest jobs at UPS is delivering packages.  Delivering packages was easy for me when I was in college, one of the jobs that I did off semesters--between semesters was I was a taxi cab driver in Buffalo.  So I knew all the streets all number bricks, all the alleys all the little trails, so when I went out as a package driver, and package delivery area knowledge is one of the hardest parts to catch on, I knew all of that cold.  And at that time we had a seven day training packet where it would have to be filled out that--by a manager that was on the car with you for seven days consecutively training you.  And I remember about half way through the second day I said to the manager, his name was Dominic Flokare [ph.], I won't forget it, I said, "I don't really want to hurt your feelings but I don't need any more training, I know what needs to be done so I can, I can really handle this."  And I could, it, it was to the point he was almost holding me back then I knew how to set the stops up and I knew, streets and the number bricks so I could get to all those delivered.  So I don't --I only stand--planned to work here--and then when I, when I did come into management it was great.  Now I--one of the things that, that came to mind was I didn't smoke I didn't drink and I was wondering if maybe that would be held against me.  I wasn't going to compromise that, I wasn't going to compromise the morality and the things that I had been taught by my parents so I said I'll go as far as I can go but I'm not going to do those things and that was never held against me and I guess that's why I sit here right now.  Through a lot of hard work you don't have to compromise anything that you were taught to do and I thought that was very important, very important.
Story_ID: 158781
Speaker 1: In what ways do you think your presence here at UPS [United Parcel Service] has impacted the lives of other African American employees?
Speaker 2: I mentor a lot.  I ask other African Americans to mentor people, especially these youngsters that are coming up now through the ranks.  I think that's all very important, I think it's important that if we have a position available that we can have three--four--five minorities and others that we can choose from for those positions.  I think it's important also that we have people prepared for those positions, the worst think that I can do is to bring a person on that can't do the job and we at UPS will never, and I've never seen it happen, and don't think I will, will put a pos--person in a position that they can't do.  If you can't do the position I don't care whether you're black, white, green or purple you're not going to get that jobs.  So we have to make sure that the people are ready for these positions that we're putting them in.  That might take doing th--a few things a little bit differently.  We sometimes tailor make plans, maybe instead of driving for a year you drive for three months and then we'll put you in the hub for three months or into the preload for three months just so that you're ready for those positions.  So, it's important to, to develop people but also make sure that they are ready for these jobs that we are going to put them in.
Speaker 1: What has been your best experience with a mentee?
Speaker 2: Well, when you can see, when you can see people that, that, get promoted up the ladder at UPS to levels of management that are higher and higher in authority and there's several that, that you can look back--one of the region managers right now is a part-time supervisor for me when I went to, went to the preload in Memphis [Tennessee] back in 1983.  And he's one of our strongest region managers right now and he'll be promoted even higher than that.  That's a good feeling when you, when you know you've worked with people like that and you've told them sometimes things that they didn't want to hear and he would get a little agitated, but now I think if you asked him he would see what it all meant, 'cause he's doing a great job now and there's many of those that we can give similar stories on.
Story_ID: 158782
Speaker 1: How do you spend your day?
Speaker 2: Working hard, my day starts--I'm usually here by 6:30-7:00. Sometimes I come earlier if I have a lot to do that day.  And I try to leave by 5:30 or 6:00.  But one of the things that I do is I make it a point to spend half my time complimenting people for the great job that they do.  And there are many things that happen every day that you can compliment someone on.  I think one of the mistakes that we make as management people is we don't thank people enough and we assume that because they go out and do a great job for you every day that they're going to continue to do that.  And I use phone calls. I made several phone calls today.  I write out notes that I send to people.  I think it's very important, one of my manager's wife was in the hospital, I sent her flowers and talked to her, talked to him.  I think just to show people that you care, these are the people that will make you or break you.  I think all of that's very important, and then I spend the rest of my time working on exceptions, things that didn't go well on Friday of last week or on Saturday when we were out delivering or yesterday when we made pick-ups, so I think that's important because if you don't do that you'll find that you'll spend most of your time working on exceptions.  And you won't take the time that it takes to say thank you to a person for a job well done, or I appreciate what you did today or I appreciate the great job that you do every day.  Very, very important.

Speaker 1: UPS [United Parcel Service] has received a great deal of recognition for your work, how do you feel about that?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure it's for my work, we have gotten a lot of recognition, we just received in November [2003] last year a great award from the National Urban League and when [HM] Marc [H.] Morial presented it he said it was a result of me being on the board and the different things that I had done.  I mean I appreciate that but UPS it's not just me, it's 370,000 people and we're all proud to receive awards like that. But I don't--I could take some of the credit but not nearly as much as given to me.  But it's--I'm proud of that.

Speaker 1: Have you ever had any experiences with discrimination or racism that you'd like to share?
Speaker 2: I can remember being interviewed for an article and the person was almost argumentative that you had to have been discriminated against while at UPS and I said, "I can give you zero instances where I've been discriminated against," and I said, "I guess if I had been discriminated against I probably wouldn't be sitting here doing an interview," is one of the remarks that I made to that person.  I just have never seen it at UPS [United Postal Service] because UPS is the type company you just come in work hard every day, you'll get to where you want.  I do have two personal experiences, when I was--the first one was in 1968 and we were driving, we were driving to Alabama and we had gotten into Alabama and we'd stopped for gas and my father [Grover Darden] was putting gas in the car and it was very, very hot day and we didn't have air conditioning in cars at that time and I was walking into a restaurant an when I got to the door there was a man standing at the door and I said, "Excuse me, I'd like to come in." and he said, "You can't come in here." And this was in 1968 and I was--although through school you read these stories, that was an eye opening experience that I would never forget.  And I said, "I can't come in, why can't I come in?"  He said, "Because we don't allow 'em in here", just like that.  And then the reality set in that this was discrimination and he said, "But if you want something, I can bring it out to the car or I'll bring it to the door."  I said, "No thanks."  And I was like mystified as I walked back to the car, that was in 1968.  1970 I was in Florida, northern part of Florida, and it was my aunt, my mother and myself, we went to a restaurant for lunch and it took a while for the waitress to come over and she finally came over and she had this funny look on her face and she says, "I really can't serve you, I can't serve you in here, but if you want something you can order it we'll bring it outside for you."  And again, we said "No, thanks, that's, that's all right." And we left.  So that was 1968, 1970, but until you go through that the reality of what you read in books and what you hear and what happened way back when doesn't set in 'til it hap--actually happens to you.

Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way that you've lived your life?
Speaker 2: I feel great about it.  I really do, and I think about that quite often.  We have three great children; I have a spectacular wife [Patricia Gail Darden] who has just done a remarkable job with the children.  Three great children that have turned out to be, I think great.  They're doing very, very well.  I think it's important to be very active in church.  I do a lot at our church, which is Greater Community Church of God in Christ, which is in Marietta here in the Georgia area.  I'm on the deacon board, I'm on the finance committee, trustee board and all those different things that I do at church.  I just love doing it.  I think it's--that's important, get a lot of satisfaction from that.  The other thing I try to do is, is help people that are in need and this is part of what I said before about (clears throat) helping others (clears throat) that are less fortunate, people that need help, I do a lot of that on my own or my wife and I together we do different things to help people.
Speaker 1: What're some of the things that you've done to help others?
Speaker 2: Well there are--there, there's a group of elderly mothers at church, we give them money every month 'cause they're mostly all on social security, so hopefully that helps them.  Or, if there's a problem around their house then we'll make sure that either I'll fix it or we'll get it fixed.  We do a lot of gift baskets at Thanksgiving and Christmas.  And there's a lot of pleasure in just delivering those baskets, just to the people that wouldn't have a good Thanksgiving or any Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner without having received those baskets and it gives you a lot of pleasure in doing that.  And, and anything that comes along that you can help somebody with, but then you'll sit like we were at the conference last week and they'll bring in a feeder driver from Laurel Mountain, which is the Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] area who spends all of his off time, he and his wife, just painting houses for people, fixing up, cleaning up yards and doing all these things.  So when you sit there and you listen at that it's makes what you do to help people almost seem inadequate, and makes you wonder if you're doing enough to help people that are less fortunate than you.  So then it makes you want to go back and reevaluate in your mind is there another half an hour or an hour that you can spend doing something or helping someone out, which is all very good--

Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a person that worked very hard at UPS [United Parcel Service].  As a person that made a difference at UPS, as a person that when your name would come up, someone would have something positive to say instead of something negative.  I would like to be remembered as that person.

Speaker 1: And within the community of African American businessmen, how do you feel as if you are, you are dealt with?
Speaker 2: With a lot of respect, almost too much respect I say in some cases.  I get a lot of credit, as I said earlier, for things that I'm not sure I deserve the credit for.  The one award I got and they asked the question about soaring, what is my opinion of soaring and I said, to me, soaring is anything but soaring, soaring is down helping people that need help.  Soaring is pushing a youngster against the wall and asking him or her why haven't they finished their college degree.  Soaring is rolling up your sleeves and doing what's necessary to make something better.  So I said for those who think they're a soarer, you're probably anything but soaring.  I firmly believe that.

Speaker 1: Are there any hopes or concerns that you have for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, I think in some cases we're caught in a vicious cycle. And I'm talk African American now, especially our young males, who I consistently, continually try to help.  I had last year two cousins that were shot and killed, both in Buffalo, New York.  Who got into things that they should not have been in, selling of drugs, and as much as I tried to talk to both of them, you can't do it long distance, with them in Buffalo and me being in Atlanta [Georgia] and traveling like I had to travel, but they were both shot and killed.  And, and then there's situations where people witnessed this happening and can give the police the name of the person that did it and the person still not get arrested says that there's something seriously wrong out there, but to see, and to read in the papers, even here in Atlanta, the numbers of, of our young black males that are shot or stabbed or in prison.  An I can remember reading about three years ago, it was almost like we were boasting, I read an article on the front page of the U.S.A. Today said, yesterday we put the one millionth man in prison, one millionth man in prison, of which 70 percent were minority or African American.  Now we're up to a million, three hundred thousand in prison.  Now where would we be with a million, three hundred thousand more men out working jobs and trying to make a positive difference instead of sitting in prison cells somewhere?  So, I, I think, I think the edu-- the answer is education, but then when you, when you say that and you actually look at what's causing the problem 60 to 70 percent come from broken homes or in most cases the female is the head of household and when these youngsters get up to twelve and thirteen, especially the boys, something happens.  They become hard and they, they start to get drawn in directions that they should not be drawn in.  So, I think, I think right now we're almost at an epidemic stage in some areas, and I'm talking about lower income areas around the United States where people don't go to school.  And I've talked to relatives that would get beat up going to school because you shouldn't go to school in this area that you live in so why don't we jump on you on the way to the bus stop and beat you up so it'll encourage you from going to school--discourage you from doing that.  And these are live real situations that I'm talking about and until we can get a handle on that.  And I'm most familiar with Buffalo [New York] because that's where home is.  When they have to bring the national guard in, and they just did that again about a month ago, or the state police and position them on every corner in certain areas of Buffalo because in a thirty year period eighteen black males between the ages of seventeen and twenty-one were murdered just in a four square block area, things like that happen.  That's, that's tough, it's a vicious, vicious cycle it's going to come down to not just education but it has to go back to the parental roots and there has to be some help, it has to be some help for these youngsters that are coming from these broken homes.  There has to be some help to, to get as many of the distractions off the streets or away from these youngsters as possible.  When you see a person riding a--by in an Escalade or a Denali or these real nice SUV's well, instead of going to work and working hard and buying my own why don't I just car jack this one?  And it has gotten to the point that there is almost no regard in some cases for life.  So why don't I not only car jack, but why don't I shoot the person also, who just happened to cooperate and do everything that I, that I asked him or her to do.  But because I have this chip on my shoulder and because the system owes me something I think I'll just shoot them or stab them although they've done everything.  I think we're in a terrible situation, it's going to take a long time to get that fixed and we'll have to start somewhere and I think we have to start soon.  The exact same thing happened here in Atlanta [Georgia], flip on your news every morning and count how many people were shot or stabbed last night.  Most of which comes out to be in the predominantly African American areas of low rent, low income and it's something that we're going to have to work very, very hard to fix.  But it's a long evolving process like; my parents did with me over the years, like I did with my youngsters over the years.  We have to go back to that, we have to get the youngsters off the street, we have to make them understand the importance of education, we have to make them understand the importance of going to church, where, where the minister, pastor, the elder can stand in front of you every week and say these are the things you should do, these are the things that you should not do and give you living prime examples.  It's going to take, it's going to take some help, but it can be fixed.

Speaker 1: What do you think needs to happen politically for that situation that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I think--
Speaker 1: --you mentioned to change?
Speaker 2: I think there's a lot that happens that needs to happen politically.  I think monies need to be funneled in the direction to fix some of these issues.  I would--for example, afternoon centers should be opened where people can come in--like myself, and not only mentor some of these students but work with them on their homework explain the importance of homework, making sure that they get home in the p.m.  Make sure that they understand that you can't just hang out in the streets--why don't we open up--and we had in Buffalo [New York]--they were called PAL Centers, Police Athletic League Centers, where you could play basketball and do all these things, everything, bowling, everything  except hangin' on the street corner waiting to get in trouble.  I think we have to have help like that.  I think we need more police officers, I don't think we have enough police officers.  Atlanta [Georgia] right now is running 400 police officers short.  That's not good.  So I think we put an incentive into the system that there's--this is what you can do when you do things right.  But I also think we have to look at the penal system and that has to be fixed some, somehow also.  We have to take people off the streets that don't want to change, we have to take drug dealers off the street that are giving drugs to these youngsters and asking them to go out and sell--"Oh by the way that SUV that you just saw, you can buy that by Friday if you sell these drugs for me."  So why would I go to school and--for four years of college and, and maybe two more years for a master's degree when I can just sell drugs and make five--ten thousand dollars a week?  Well that's all good for that one week, until all of a sudden the system turns on you and this is exactly what happens, and then somebody says, "Well since he has five or ten thousand dollars in his pocket why don't I just kill or rob him and take that mone?".  So then it becomes this vicious cycle that they get caught in and that's what's going on right now in America, all across the United States of America.  So I think the politician can help an awful lot.  I think--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Are there.
Speaker 2: --we should have rules that, if I'm the mayor, if I'm the police chief, if I'm a police officer, if I am a civic leader I should have to live in certain areas.  I don't know how much I should care, if, if you've elected me Mayor of Atlanta and I live in Roswell, or Mayor of Atlanta [Georgia] and I live in Alpharetta [Georgia], well I leave this trouble at 6 p.m. every day and I go north and never to be heard of 'til tomorrow or I turn the news on and see what happens to this great city that I have to now go back down into for eight or nine hours a day.  The politicians can make rules like that and they can make those changes.  It's going to take everybody working together to make a difference though.

Speaker 1: I would answer from the UPS [United Parcel Service] angle, I would love to see us a stronger company today than we were yesterday.  I would like to see us continue to stifle the competition.  Like that envelope we looked at earlier, but I won't put that in the interview (laughter).  I would like to see us continue to stifle the competition and become a stronger company.  I personally would like to see more African Americans in key leadership positions, and it's changing, it's changing over time because you can look at the people that we've moved from the driving ranks into full-time supervisor ranks that are becoming managers that are becoming division managers and district managers.  Those are the type things that, that I would like to see.  And this question about what I would like to see in the United States, I would like to see not seventy percent of our black males locked up in prisons or institutions somewhere.  I'd like to see that number at seven percent not seventy percent.  I would like to see our youngsters be able to walk up and down the streets without being accosted, our young girls raped, our young men being shot.  Those are some of the type of things I'd like to see change and I'll do all that I can to make those change.
