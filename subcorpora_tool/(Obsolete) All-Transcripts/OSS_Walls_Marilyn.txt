 Sherman and today is October 15, 2009. I   m visiting  with Marilyn Green Walls in Stillwater, Oklahoma during the 2009  Homecoming celebration. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories  project of the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. I want to  thank you personally for your time today and welcome you back to  Stillwater.  Thank you. I   m delighted to be here.  How long has it been since you   ve been up to Stillwater?  Well, we have come for the Oklahoma Pecan Growers Association when  it was held here about four years ago. And we came on campus to show  our children the university one time. And then Dale and I came back for  our honeymoon, actually. Other that, I think three times probably in the  fifty  years  since I   ve graduated. (Laughs)  What do you think about all the changes that are happening within the  community and on campus?  To be honest, I think they are very much less for the student than they  used to be then. Everything was geared toward the students    education  and not just growing academically, but socially. There were so many  activities for us and they were all covered by our tuition. We could take  as many hours as we wanted for  66 a semester. And that included all  the activities, all the special performing artists that came to campus. It  covered all of the athletic scope, football, basketball, baseball, and  whatever you wanted to go to. So they encouraged a lot of interaction.  They don   t today because it   s so expensive. And I think that has changed  the emphasis away from the student.  Now for  66, I don   t think you can get into Saturday night   s football  5  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  game.  No. And I think that ten times more than that would be a fair semester  tuition if it were geared back to the students.  Have you seen all the construction taking place on campus?  Quite a bit.  And what do you think about that?  I did take one other trip by myself and I went through Willard and I saw  what they had done to my room. I know now it   s the Education  Building. So there   s a lot of new construction, it   s huge. It   s grown  tremendously.  Do you think that   s a good thing?  Well I like to see more and more people have an opportunity to go to  college, but I hate for the campus to become so large people are lost.  What is the number of students? It was 10,000 when I was here.  23,000.  Oh, so it   s not much, it   s doubled.  It seems bigger.  Yes, it seems a lot bigger.  Let   s get into your background. Can you tell me where you grew up and  that kind of information? The size of your family, what high school you  went to?  I was born in Sulphur, Oklahoma which is the home of Platt National  Park. The house I was raised in actually shared a common fence  with  the park , so I was able in the morning to get up and go swimming  before school or ride a horse down there. There were five children in the  family; a boy, Joe, and there were four of us girls, Patsy, Karen, and  Judy. It was a very laid-back time. We would leave town and not lock  our home, that sort of thing. My daddy was a merchant and he turned  into a rancher in later years. It was a wonderful time to grow up in  Oklahoma.  Sulphur High School, then?  6  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sulphur High School was where I graduated. I did have to go to East  Central State College one summer and to Monte Cassino in Tulsa one  summer in order to graduate in three years. I skipped a year in high  school.  Was that a requirement to get into OSU?  Oh no, no, no, no. I just had to graduate. (Laughs) And I decided I was  going to do it early, which I don   t highly recommend.  What influenced you on your decision to attend Oklahoma A   M?  I knew students who were here. I   d always heard wonderful things. At  that time it was Oklahoma A   M, did not change until we graduated to  OSU. The student body was very opposed to the name change, but they  did it anyway. (Laughs) That was in 1959 that they changed it.  Why did the university want to change the name to Oklahoma State  University?  Basically I think they wanted to be a university instead of a college. And  I think that prestige and that sort of thing goes with the name. It couldn   t  have been a finer school, in my opinion, than what it was. A very  dedicated staff and a marvelous atmosphere on campus. I can   t see that  it   s been an improvement; probably more research is done here. But to  me the university isn   t the place for research. It   s where you educate  young people. Being a teacher and being a fourth-generation teacher, I  can   t see that that should be required. They want every professor to  publish and every science person to be involved in research and while I  think that   s wonderful, that doesn   t do much for the student body.  It sounds like you weren   t the first person to attend college in your  family.  Actually my brother preceded me here but only for a short time. I had a  sister come here, a brother-in-law after I was here. I was the first one to  graduate but my mother and father, he graduated from Draughon   s  Business College in Oklahoma City and she went to college the same  time I did. After she raised five children she went to school and beat me  in all the grades. She was marvelous. (Laughter) Matter of fact, she  almost had a 4.0 at East Central State College.  Was that a little competition between you two?  I knew better. (Laughs) So no, no competition.  7  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  And so your mother ended up teaching after she raised the children?  Yes.  How long did she teach?  I don   t know. She taught at Oklahoma School for the Deaf for awhile.  She got a stipend or was asked to come to Gallaudet School. She  attended that university and came back and taught at Oklahoma School  for the Deaf for a few years and then was put into a classroom for a  number of years. Then she was a coordinator of reading for the district.  So I   d say twenty-plus.  Wow. Prior to your OSU experience had you visited the campus?  Never.  What were your first impressions of the campus and Stillwater when you  arrived?  I   ll never make it between classes. I   m scared to death. (Laughter) I  mean, it was huge to me. I had gone to East Central State College and  taken courses between high school. It was a little small community  compared to OSU. And then I had gone to a school in Mexico, in  Monterrey. It was the first year for women to ever  attend  and that was  that summer, as well. So I   d been on other college campuses but never  on Oklahoma State   s.  Now obviously you adapted to the campus. What years did you live in  Willard Hall?  I graduated in three and a half years and I was there all the time. Same  room, same dorm. Willard Two.  What years were they?     55 in the fall, let   s see,    55,    56,    57,    58 and then graduated in January.  So you   re class of        59 because it was January.  Did many people graduate at that time that year?  It depended when they started but I didn   t personally know of any  others.  8  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Were you assigned to Willard Hall or did you specifically request  Willard?  I was just assigned there.  And luck would have it.  And luck would have it that I ended up in one of the nicest places to  possibly live on campus as far as the people that were there.  Do you know how Willard Hall got its name?  Oh, it   s been too long ago since I   ve read that.  What were your first impressions of Willard Hall?  First impressions. I thought it had a beautiful view if you were on the  south of Theta Pond. It was pretty nicely arranged as far as being close  to Whitehurst and the Student Union. And I really loved it, thought it  was very nice.  What floor did you live on?  Second.  And you were on the second floor all three years?  Yes, same room.  What room number?  223, right next to the elevator. That wasn   t good. All of us that ever  lived in that room had breast cancer. Everyone. Everyone.  Jinxed?  No, I think because of the asbestos in the shaft and our closets were back  there. They   ll probably eliminate that, but that   s true.  I   m sorry to hear that. What did your window face?  Whitehurst.  You didn   t get the good view.  No, I didn   t get the good view but it was a lovely dorm and I enjoyed  9  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  that.  Can you describe what your room was like? If you go onto the campus  now you get these apartment suites.  Oh, I know, I know. And you have telephones. Well our telephone was  down the hall. And most of the rooms in Willard were just a little square  room with a sink sticking out of the wall. My room was offset behind the  elevator and so our closets were larger and we had an offset sink and  that was kind of nice, but that was the only unique thing in the room.  Could you hear the elevator move up and down?  Oh, yeah.  Was that loud?  No, it wasn   t bad, you got used to it. I really wanted to keep the same  room.  How did the operation of the floor phone work?  Well since it was very close to my room I ended up answering it if it  rang very many times. Because if a guy was calling for one of the girls  he wasn   t going to hang up until somebody answered. I mean someone  has to be home. (Laughs) So it would ring a lot. And then we   d just yell.  There were only two phones on the whole floor, so you didn   t spend a  lot of time if someone wanted to call out. But there were phones  downstairs that you could use. So it wasn   t really inconvenient and we  didn   t talk on the phone like people do today. I mean, you didn   t call to  just visit like you text message all the time. There was very little. I think  I called home three times the first semester maybe. You just didn   t call  all the time like people do today.  You wrote.  Yes, we wrote more. But that was usually a communication that was like  a round robin to a whole family and you   d send it around or information  you really wanted to kind of keep.  Was there a particular advantage to being close to answering the floor  phone?  Oh, no. No, not really.  You didn   t get any tidbits, oh so-and-so was dating so-and-so.  10  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  I couldn   t care less. (Laughs)  What were the bathroom facilities like on your floor?  We had a bathroom down around the hall which served half of Willard  Two. And there was one on the far end. There were maybe eight  showers. When you first walked in there were maybe that many stools.  But then you had a place to wash things out, a sink or two, and several  shower stalls. That served the whole dorm. No men were allowed ever  on the floor.  Did you feel that your privacy was lost or was that really an issue with  you?  It was not an issue.  Just grew used to it?  No. You know, families were raised with only one bathroom. You got  used to not having extreme conveniences like that. So it was as I  expected it to be.  Was there air conditioning at that time?  Oh, no. No, you took a Coke bottle and you put a cork in it that had a  sprinkler on top. You   d sprinkle your sheets before you went to bed and  turn on a fan   if you were lucky and had one. That was how you kept  cool in the summer.  What was the school year like? When did it start and when did it end  and when were the breaks usually?  We started around the very first of September through the end of May.  We had our Christmas break, which was a religious holiday, and Easter.  We went home for Thanksgiving and there might have been a day or two  extra but there were no long breaks except at Christmastime.  Was Easter considered the Spring Break?  What you consider Spring Break, yes.  What was your room like in the wintertime?  Well we had heaters that clanged and banged but they were functional;  kept us warm. I was never cold. But they certainly weren   t as nice as  central heating today. Everyone had their individual heater. It was a  11  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  space heater like you would find in some motels, against the wall.  What were your roommates like?  My first roommate was a senior and she was delightful. Pat was going to  be a CPA and she passed her exam. I had no idea what a difficult thing  that is and how many times people fail it before they pass it. I think she  passed it the first time. That was very good.  Oh, wow. Did you have two more  roommates  then?  Yes. Elaine Muntz and Benita Bournay Cook and then Diane Joel was  the last semester, what would have been my fourth year, and she was  from my hometown. But the other girls were Home Ec majors and  Education majors; Elaine Muntz was Education. And I taught basically  at the same school, we did our student teaching together. Benita and I  have visited and travelled together. Wonderful Christian girls. There was  never conflict. I was very fortunate.  At that time was Willard considered a popular or prestigious hall?  I don   t think so. I mean everyone loved the porch and Theta Pond but  other than that there was not very much variation in dorms. That   s my  opinion. But it was well-run. It was very strictly run. The doors were  locked at a certain time and you   d better be in. (Laughter) You know,  basic rules.  Did you have friends in Stout or Murray at that time?  No, but I did go to summer school one year and I lived in Murray. And I  found it very similar. I mean, smaller and more compact but as far as  living there and the facilities, they were the same.  Did you ever visit any of the male dormitories?  Oh, no. Well, I went over and had dinner a few times. But no, you didn   t  visit in the rooms of male students and they didn   t visit in yours. That  was a personal private place. And you know, if you wanted to lay around  in your slip or you wanted to trot down in your robe to take a bath,  you   re not faced with meeting some guy standing there or coming to see  your roommate. So it was a place to study and a place to relax.  Now let   s go on with some of the traditions. Did you hear about the  Willard Beach and what was that like?  I have no idea. Wasn   t in on that.  12  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  What about some Christmas traditions?  At Willard? Oh, we always had a beautiful tree in the main room. Girls  decorated their doors and their rooms. We made it home. And I think the  traditions that you had at home were very compatible to the traditions  that you would expect at the time.  Did you exchange gifts with your roommates or anything like that? Or  have floor exchanges?  Occasionally. Not every year, it just kind of depended. I know some  groups drew names but it was like that little in-group. I think the woman  you interviewed before me was in a very tight group because they were  at that little  area  where the hall dead ends and so you have several  rooms kind of close together and they were very close. One of them  worked in student placement and if you were in 4-H you were in that  end of the hall. So there was a lot of that that went on that didn   t in other  areas of the building.  Because the group that   s meeting today is basically made up of second  floor girls, did you interact with other girls on third, fourth, first?  Some. My husband, we of course weren   t married then, but he worked  for Leech Laundry and you had to deliver. And I took that job for our  dorm so yes, I was all over the dorm.  Getting back to the traditions, did the hall participate in any of the  Homecoming events?  Yes. I personally was not involved in that. But mostly I think that would  have been those who pledged, primarily. And of course we had our own  queen and there were a lot of things that went on. We had our own  dances. We were very often invited to fraternity-sorority dances, but  basically we had Tri-dorm for the three girls    dorms or the different  men   s halls had formal dances. But I personally wasn   t involved in the  parades and things.  Were you involved with keeping any of the scrapbooks of the dorm or  did you make any scrapbooks at that time?  No, I wish I had.  You wish you had?  Oh, definitely. I did take a great deal of pictures. But that would have  been a great time to put them together, as they should have been.  13  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Do you still have those?  Oh, yes. (Laughs)  Now let   s get down to the nuts and bolts of some of the dorm rules. What  were the residence hall hours when you were on the campus?  For the lower classmen it was eight o   clock. Ten o   clock if you were  upperclassmen. And the door was locked during the week. Friday I  believe it was open for everyone till ten. Special nights like a dance, a  formal dance, it was twelve. They bent that a little bit I think by my  senior year, but when the dance was over most of us walked to the dance  and most of us walked back. Cars on campus were very few. Which  today I can look back and say,    You know, that was kind of a blessing,     because it kept us on campus doing things with other students and I  think there was a lot of things that were so close we could all walk. And  we walked in groups and we walked to all these events that were free to  us as students.  Do you remember any of the penalties for coming in late past the  curfew?  I never was involved in that so I don   t really know. But there were  rumors. I know one girl was sent home. But I had a girl across the hall  that was on the balcony of the back porch who would go skunk hunting  or possum hunting or whatever with her fianc   and come home smelling  just exactly like they had met the skunk they went to seek. She never got  caught, I don   t think. But surely they knew; I mean, you just don   t end  up smelling like a skunk for two weeks if you were back in time.  (Laughter) I only knew one girl that actually violated with regularity and  they sent her home. She was expelled.  Oh, wow. Upperclassmen after the door was locked had to     You could sign out.  And then once you got home you had to be buzzed in or how did that  work?  You buzzed the door and they would let you in. But you would check  out if you had a research paper, you had something you needed to work  on in the library   and I believe the hours at the library were midnight.  So you were expected to be back by then. And you signed in and you  signed out.  Was there a dress code in the hall?  14  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  No.  What about on campus?  No. There weren   t any violations of it. I mean it was before the short  skirts and it was before a lot of things that are today accepted. I know I  wore jeans a lot so I know from that standpoint there wasn   t a dress  code. But most girls wore skirts, bobby socks, sweaters, you know. It  was a time of long dresses and very straight skirts or the extreme of that,  of very long skirts but full. I mean we might wear fifteen petticoats of  different colors and so our dresses were very broad. But I don   t recall a  code where they expected anything except to be properly dressed,  modest.  Was clothing at that time more comfortable or as comfortable as it is  now?  It was a lot less comfortable. I remember squeezing my waist down to a  21    with wide belts on these full skirts. Everyone did that. So they  weren   t particularly comfortable but they were a lot of fun. You had to  do a lot of ironing, so there wasn   t the permanent press. There was a lot  more work in your wardrobe, to maintain it.  How would you entertain yourselves in the dorm itself when you had  free time?  Very little entertainment type things. We visited a lot, sat around and  talked a lot. Some played bridge but not a lot. We had a few people that  would come and play the piano in the main room. Basically it was just  sitting around visiting in groups.  Did any of you have record players or anything of that nature?  I saw very few. I never had a radio or a record player or a cell phone or a  computer or any of the things that you might expect someone to have  today. And so we didn   t self-entertain. We entertained in groups and  with other people in person. There was not hardly any of that.  A different era. Now on your overall Willard experience, what were  some of the special hall events and activities that you remember?  The dances were wonderful. We were expected to wear formals. It was a  very, very dressed up event and beautifully done. We had grand  marches, our music was ballroom. We did jitterbug a lot and that was  wonderful. The big band era was probably at its peak so we had a lot of  Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey type thing, The Four Lads   we just had a  15  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  lot of beautiful music, great music. So the dances were a big thing. And  we had the Tri-dorm  dances , I want to say one or two a semester but  you usually were invited to one of the fellows    or when the fraternities  went together and had theirs. So there were lots of dances to go to, a lot  of social things on campus.  When Willard Hall had a dance, where was it?  The Student Union. They had a beautiful ballroom and at that time it  was a gorgeous building, it was immaculate. And that was one of the  greatest disappointments coming back is to see the run-down condition  of Willard and the Student Union. It wasn   t even clean by standards that  it had been. Oh, we had people that were mopping and cleaning all the  time. I mean the brass was polished. They were beautiful buildings.  Did you have to be asked to go to the dance?  The girls asked the guy always for the Tri-dorm. And then to go to one  of the men   s you had to have an invitation. You didn   t just go. Girls just  didn   t accompany each other to functions like that.  Was there any diversity in Willard? Did you see any other ethnic groups  or other international students?  Oh, yes. One of the most lovely ladies I   ve ever met in my life was  Zapora Eden. She was head of a teacher   s college in Jerusalem. She  lived on Willard Two, just around the corner from me. We would spend  hours talking. She was a wonderful woman. And there were other Jewish   people  that I knew, there were quite a few Italians, one was in our  wedding. It was Mary Jane Marzola and Nancy Vinzetta. And then there  were African American students but there weren   t many at that time.  How were they treated on campus?  I thought wonderful. One of the girls made a comment of saying how  she was just one of the group, one particular girl, and then when she was  dating a black fellow it was like... But at the same time she was just one  of the group and people thought highly of her. Whether they had close  relationships, I don   t know, but it seemed very much to be included.  Have you remained in contact with your second floor girls throughout  the years?  Not particularly the group that has come here. But I   ve travelled some  with my college roommate and written several friends or emailed quite a  bit. But we   re a very busy and active large family and so our lives are  16  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  very full and that   s kind of icing on the cake to be able to do that.  How did you hear about this particular reunion?  One of the girls called. Phyllis and Troy Pults. She played the piano and  he sang in our wedding.  Did you meet your husband at OSU?  No, actually I was at East Central State College one summer and met  him. He was already here in a five-year electrical engineering school  when I came up and we dated the full time I was here off and on, mostly  on. We   ve been married fifty years.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Now let   s probe into what was dating like for you back then?  We walked. (Laughs) We danced all the time. Dale   s always saying,     You were the cheapest date. Someone else   s quarters would fill the  Nickelodeon and I   d buy you a Coke.    (Laughter) We walked to church.  We walked to a very, very rare movie. I think we went twice the whole  time I was here. We frequently went to church together. But other than  that, we just spent time together.  Where did you go for the movies?  I can   t even remember the name of the show.  Do you remember the theater?  It was a theater. But it was a long walk.  Was it in downtown Stillwater?  It seemed like it was on the southeast end of the campus and a little  south. I haven   t been there in fifty years, so it   s hazy. Very rarely did we  ever go out and eat. I mean, he might come to my dorm where my meal  was paid for and buy his meal and we   d eat together occasionally. And I  was invited to his dorm occasionally. We hardly ever ate out back then.  I   m going to ask you about some overall OSU experiences. What was  your major, just to get it down for the record?  17  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Well, when I came to college I really didn   t even realize that you chose a  school. I thought maybe you got your basics and then you had time. So I  got up here and I said,    Well I want to learn shorthand and typing. I  want to do this and that.       Oh, we   ll put you in this school.    See, I didn   t  want it for that. I wanted pre-med. So second semester I went to pre-med.  I spent about a year and a half and then I decided I   m going to  graduate. So I have a Bachelor of Science and then an Education degree.  But I saw a chance of graduating early and it looked like my husband  and I were going to defer getting married a couple of years and I  thought, I think I   ll go somewhere and teach. So I graduated early.  And you ended up becoming a teacher?  Yes.  How many years did you teach?  Seventeen.  Were you involved with any campus activities?  The international students, I loved that. We had a great many  international students and we had a girl from Sweden on our floor. My  matron of honor was from Panama. Doris Corneho was another Willard  Two girl who was from Panama. I really was involved in that and I had  gone to school for a summer in Mexico, so that was neat. I was more  involved in that than probably any other organization. But we gave  demonstrational dances, my husband and I. There was a group that came  out of Ms. Ellis    dance class and she was a phenomenal little teeny grey-headed  woman that taught on campus. You could recognize her style  anywhere in the United States. I   ve travelled and gone to formal dances  and I said,    You knew Ms. Ellis at Oklahoma State,    they said,    How  did you know?    (Laughter) Because you see the steps and the sequence  of steps and you go,    That   s Ms. Ellis.    She was fantastic.  What kind of dances would she teach?  Oh, the rumba and the samba and the cha cha cha and the jitterbug and  just all kinds of dances. Ballroom dancing.  Nice. Now were you involved with your church on campus?  Yes. I went to MYF and I went to the Methodist church then. We didn   t  continue in that church. We belong to a non-denominational church, but  that   s where I went and my husband also.  18  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Was that a campus group then?  Well the MYF was.  What does that stand for?  Methodist Youth Fellowship.  Did you attend any of the sporting events here on campus?  Oh, yes. Everyone would go to whatever was in season.  Did you have a particular favorite?  Football.  Do you remember any particular games or any particular memories of  that era of football?  Not after fifty years, except screaming and yelling and singing and really  enjoying it. Oh, another organization, I was on the girl   s rifle team and I  was on the swim team.  Oh, really?  Not a long time, but I did some of that.  That   s something we should talk about because this is pre-Title IX.  I don   t know what Title IX includes.  Well, it   s pre-university funded athletics. You were on the rifle team,  how did you get involved with that?  Well, shooting guns was not all that unusual for anybody. And I had a  relative that I didn   t really know but heard about all my life   two  actually, women that were marksmen. I was a good shot and managed to  shoot myself only once. I didn   t do any of the competition. Girls didn   t  do a lot of competition. I didn   t do competition on the swim team either.  I entered it and worked out and I was a good swimmer. I had my WSI  and taught swimming but I had never done that kind of swimming  before. And so I really enjoyed it and became part of it.  Where did you swim?  In the swimming pool in Gunderson Hall, I think that   s where.  19  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Do you have any fond memories of any particular place on campus?  The Student Union. I almost danced my way out of college. My father  said,    If your grades don   t get better, you can come home and work in  the store.    (Laughs) But everyone ballroom danced and it was a fun  thing. And in high school we   d had a nice place in Sulphur to dance that  was called Teen Town and you danced all the time. It was that excess in  my case the first semester. (Laughter)  Did you do any Texas Swing country western dances, too?  Swing wasn   t in. Line dance was not in. I   ve done that in years since,  but no. The Hokey Pokey was about as line dance as we had.  Did you remember any music acts that came through at that time?  Yes. The Four Lads, the Ink Spots, we had a hypnotist   I mean he was  fantastic. We had bands. I   m almost afraid to say who all they were. But  yes, we had wonderful artists that came to us. And they were free to the  students. And so, like I say, all of the other activities were, too. Now we  paid for our formal dances.  Wasn   t part of the  66?  No, the formal dances, the Tri-dorm dances, the girl paid for whatever it  was going to cost   I think it was  10 a couple.  So you really had to pay for your man instead?  For those dances, yes.  Was there a formal meal with that, too?  No.  Was country music popular here too at that time?  No. Generally speaking we didn   t have Garth Brooks back then, you  know. (Laughs) But we had more of the big band sounds and a lot of  swing. But other than that     And this is pre-rock and roll?  No, it was rock and roll. But you could go off campus if you wanted  country western dancing and it was a popular dance, but it was not on  campus. And I think that probably was wise. I think they tried to give  20  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  people a little culture on campus, giving us opportunity to do things that  we wouldn   t do in our small hometowns.  During your time the Hideaway opened. Do you remember actually  going to that?  I never had a car and I never got to go to the Hideaway.  Are there any other off campus or on campus student hangouts that you  can remember?  I hardly ever left campus, no.  Do you remember any professors or courses that had particular  influence on you?  Yes. There was a Mr. White who taught philosophy and humanities. He  was such a remarkable man and remarkable speaker, teacher. I was  never enrolled in his class but he would allow those who weren   t  enrolled in his overflowing classes to line the walls.  Oh, wow.  And he was wonderful. Myrtle Schwarz was the elementary art teacher.  And she took me in her home   I developed Asian flu and I almost died.  I spent a lot of time in the hospital and when I came back I couldn   t  walk; at least I couldn   t walk to class. I almost passed out going to her  class and she   d been concerned. She said,    You come home and you live  with me.     Oh, wow. That   s very kind of her.  Very.  Did you get a graduate degree here?  I did not get a graduate degree above my degree here. I have taken  courses at A   M in Texas and reading courses and things over the years  that I taught toward a degree, but I wasn   t interested in an advanced  degree.  How has OSU prepared you for the rest of your life?  Well I just think it gives you a foundation to enter into any situation and  be successful because you   re a more well-rounded person, not because  you have a piece of paper. I think the degree opens doors, but how well-  21  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  Walls  Sherman  rounded you are is how you fit in everywhere you go.  Do you have anything else you would like to add?  No. Other than I would wish that there were rules and regulations on this  campus as there were in the years when I went where the integrity of the  girl isn   t always put in question, isn   t always a problem. Where you  have freedom to go back into the privacy of where you live. My  daughter is a teacher as well and when she went to school, the first thing  that happened was a roommate brought a man in to spend the weekend  and so she had to come home. I said,    Look, make some rules here and  you say,    I pay rent and no more of this.       But that should never be a  problem. I   m sorry for all the problems there are in society today that  lend to that.  I would like to see a more student-oriented feel to the campus where the  importance of the student is why the university exists and give them  cultural advantages. I really think that   s something that the University  needs to look back on the past and say,    We had well-rounded people  who could fit into any situation and do well and the reason for that is  because they had so many opportunities to meet people from all over the  world, to go to things that weren   t available in their little hometown, and  that they were part of the student body and the activities.    Young people  can   t afford it, but then at school they have a cell phone, they have a  computer, they have all that. That should come with right now, you   re  developing this person to step into society.  Now, you live in Texas, right?  Yes.  How do people react when you say that you   re an OSU graduate?  I don   t think there is a negative or a positive reaction.  Okay. I just wondered.  As engineering, my husband said,    Oh, you   re from Oklahoma State  University.    The Engineering School has great respect at least in the  early years of his being an electrical engineer. And it meant a lot. We  had no jobs in Oklahoma. You had to leave because there were no  electrical engineering companies of any size. But their graduates were  prized. So we got very positive feedback then. Educationally, I think  they went more by GPA.  I want to thank you for the interview today. It was my pleasure. And  22  Walls  welcome back to Stillwater.  Thank you. We   re looking forward to having a big reunion. Thank you.  -------  -------
