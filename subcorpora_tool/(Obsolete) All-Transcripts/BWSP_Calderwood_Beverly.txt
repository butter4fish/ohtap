Brian Kunkleman: [00:00] This is Brian Kunkleman, interviewing Mrs. Hart for the Pembroke
Center for the Fordham Archives. And I'm in her home in Seekonk, Massachusetts today, May
16th, and that's how we're supposed to test you're –
Beverly Anne Calderwood (Hart): Yeah.
BK: – supposed to say something.
BAC: OK, that sounds fine. Brian, I believe, is going to ask me something about my family
background before I was at Brown or Pembroke. Nice to see Pembroke included in these lists,
because obviously, in '52, it was Pembroke – you're going to check it now, see if it's running?
BK: Yeah, let's (inaudible).
(break in audio)
BK: We can start. (laughter) First, just – we'd like to know a short family background. Mother
and father, education, occupations, and what you planned to do when you were younger.

1

BAC: OK. I'm [01:00] an only child, so any concentration on aspirations for children were
centered on their only child. And neither my mother or father had a benefit of college education,
but I consider them self-educated. They did a great deal of reading. And mother came from
England when she was six, and she attended school only up through the ninth grade. But at this
point, she has read – and also, I would consider that she had a – she was well-versed in all areas
of what's going on in the world. And my father went through an apprentice program and ended
up owning his own foundry and innovating different malleable substances in an iron foundry –
but did a quite creditable job of being a self-made man. But they felt that there was a value to
education, and they wanted me to have what they hadn't had, and asked me what I wanted to do.
I had a successful high school career, and I was [02:00] valedictorian. And I said, well, the most
prestigious local school was Brown or Pembroke, and I'd like to apply for that. So, I applied – it
was the only place I applied, and I was accepted. And there was no problems about my going
because I was a girl, because obviously, if anybody was going to go, their children, it was going
to be me because it was the only one they had. And it was up to me to decide what to do with it
afterwards. If they could provide the education, they were going to do it. (inaudible)
(break in audio)
BAC: Is there anything else you want to know?
BK: Well, the foundry speaks, I mean, to me.
BAC: Well, he used to work at Brown and Sharpe. Now, you don't come from this area, but one
time, that was one of the most prestigious foundries in Rhode Island. The shop – Dexter, Brown,
Chafee families instituted Brown and Sharpe, as well as many other companies. And my father
rose [03:00] up to be – first of all, superintendent of the foundry at Brown and Sharpe, where is –
where he'd done his apprentice work as a pattern maker. And then became knowledgeable about
their molds and everything, their materials, everything they had. When the war came along, he
went on the road as troubleshooter for them, because they had a lot of government contracts. So,
he was pretty well-versed in all aspects of it, not just in running a machine, which he didn't do.
And then he got into the malleable iron, which is something that can be molded differently. It's
2

not run off like everything else is in great quantities. You have to get a specific chemical formula
for a specific purpose, and he started doing those for Brown and Sharpe. And later on, an exemployee who had started his own business approached my father and asked him if he would run
a business if he would supply [04:00] the capital for him, which he did.
BK: Wow.
BAC: And he did that in Rehoboth in a small place they started. And he worked mostly in
making parts for textile machinery, which was a big industry in New England at the time.
BK: Yeah.
BAC: So, he made himself quite a decent wage, and did it all the hard way. And I'm very –was
very proud of him. And he retired in '71 and went to live in Florida for his health, and he died
five years ago. My mother didn't have any formal education, but as I said before, she has read
and is interested in things, and when the game shows are on and she answers all the questions
ahead of me, I feel as though probably her education was – stood her in good stead by reading all
the time. She's very active, and I – (phone rings)
(break in audio)
BK: (inaudible)
BAC: Yeah, and she's – my mother still lives in Florida. Stays down there because she has a lot
of friends, and she can golf [05:00] down there, whereas up here, in the winter, she can't do
anything.
BK: That's true. (laughter) OK, you were born in Providence?
BAC: Yes.

3

BK: And you went to high school…?
BAC: In Warwick. Gorton High School. It was the high school at the time. It's now a junior high.
There were three high schools in the city of Warwick, and this was one of them. I went there as a
junior and senior high.
BK: Yeah? Did you play sports in high school?
BAC: Yeah, all of them.
BK: Yeah.
BAC: Earned my letter. We had a fairly active physical education department, and – so, every
season there was a sport. We were not into lacrosse and – but we did play field hockey, soccer,
baseball, basketball. Those were the main ones, I guess, I took part in. That took most of the
year. (laughs)
BK: Yeah, I'd say. Were you recruited by –
BAC: No.
BK: They didn't have recruiting at that time?
BAC: They [06:00] did, I know, for football, because a fellow the next year was recruited for
football from the same high school. But, no, I don't think they did much with women's sports at
the time.
BK: I see.
BAC: So – no, I applied, and just got accepted, and you'll have to ask the admissions why.
(laughter)
4

BK: And you went to college because (skip in tape) college and it was the most prestigious one
around?
BAC: Yes.
BK: So, you applied to Brown and the rest is history?
BAC: (laughs) Well, more or less. It went to the next step that I went in the fall of '48, yes.
BK: You heard about Brown because you were here and it was right there.
BAC: Yes.
BK: Pembroke was right here.
BAC: I read about it and, yes, and liked what I had heard, and I wanted liberal arts. I did not
know what my goals were at the time, for long-range –
BK: I see.
BAC: – decision [07:00] as far as a job. I just wanted to go to college and then decide from there
what I thought I was really going to succeed at, or hopefully succeed at.
BK: What did your family think about you going to school?
BAC: Oh, they were very excited. That was fine.
BK: Yeah?

5

BAC: As long as they could afford it. The problem was, my father was starting the business, so
for two years, I commuted. I was what you called a city girl.
BK: City girl.
BAC: I lived at home, which was in Warwick, and would have to go back and forth every day.
And then, the – but business solidified, he started to feel that he could let me stay at the school,
and I stayed my last two years in the dorm.
BK: Yeah?
BAC: So, I had both sides of the academic and dorm life type – it was good. It was a good
experience.
BK: Was the dorm easier?
BAC: Oh, living there was much easier, but I made a lot of friends with people in the area. Well,
some of them still live in the area. And we appreciated [08:00] our dorm life more than some of
the boys and girls – were there right from the beginning and took it for granted, yeah, so –
BK: I'm sure.
BAC: Yeah, yeah.
BK: OK, like, the first day, you went – (laughter) when you went to Pembroke, I guess we'd
have to say in '50, because you commuted your first two years. When you first roomed with
someone, like, do you remember that?
BAC: I had a single.
BK: You had a single?
6

BAC: Yes, I had a single. And my room became the oasis for the people – couldn't get along
with their roommates or didn't (laughter) want to study and their roommate wanted to study. So,
normally I started my studying about 10 at night, when I finally asked them to leave so I could
do my homework.
BK: Yeah.
BAC: So – but it was fine, because I had quite a selection that way.
BK: But where did you stay?
BAC: What do you mean?
BK: What dorm?
BAC: Oh, Andrews. I was in East and West Andrews.
BK: Yeah?
BAC: Yeah, that's – we didn't have the selection that you have today as much, and it was a
purely [09:00] female dorm. (laughs) It was all females. And the whole campus was all females.
BK: Yeah.
BAC: So, it's entirely different.
BK: They didn't have any coed bathrooms, either.
BAC: None. No, and –

7

BK: Think I would have liked that.
BAC: And it was very comfortable, because if you wanted to go around and – whatever you
happened to have on in your room, you didn't feel as though – that someone else was going to
meet you in the hallway and you shouldn't be dressed that way. It was very comfortable.
BK: Yeah, I'm sure it was.
BAC: Ran around however we wanted to, so –
BK: So, you lived in a single.
BAC: Yes.
BK: Did you have a roommate your senior year?
BAC: Nope. Both years, I had a single.
BK: You just had a single.
BAC: And it worked out fine, as I say. I was class president my senior year.
BK: Yeah?
BAC: So, I obviously had made some friends.
BK: Right.
BAC: And I found that I could balance things better that way than having to be obligated,
probably, to a particular roommate that I hadn't lived with right from the beginning. [10:00] You
know, a lot of the girls stayed as roommates all the way through. They came together from the
8

same area or they met freshman week and decided, well – and then they stayed with that person,
because they thought they were compatible. And a lot of people at times had to get away from
the same person living – same – just like your siblings at home, you know? And, of course, I
came from being an only child at a home.
BK: So, you were –
BAC: So, I was used to being alone. It didn't bother me that way. In fact, I enjoyed it.
BK: Yeah.
BAC: So – but I could go out when I wanted to go out, so I thought it was the best of both
worlds.
BK: Yeah, a single would be nice. I agree, because I wasn't an only child, but I have a brother
who's 11 years older than me. So –
BAC: Oh –
BK: – for the most part, I lived alone, and I was (inaudible) child. So, let's see, next thing is the
most important influence on you at Pembroke. Like, courses, [11:00] or something like that
BAC: Well, I was – I'd started out as a math major, and the first exam we had in our analytical
geometry, nobody passed. He gave the same exam the next week, and one person passed. So, I
went to see Dean Lewis, and of course she was the Pembroke dean. And I said, “For some
reason, I don't seem to be adjusting too well to this particular major.” And she said, “Well, it's up
to you.” She said, “If you pass that course, you've got it made. But it is difficult.” I said, “I'm not
enjoying it,” and mostly because the head of the department was teaching it, and I didn't feel as
though I was going in there for research. I wanted the practical knowledge and then I was going
to decide what I was going to do with it afterwards, and I didn't relate to him at all. And she said,
“Well, what do you think you would change to?” And I said, “Well, it's entirely different. It
9

would be English literature.” She said, “No, I don't think that's too strange. I did the same thing
when I was an undergraduate, [12:00] going from math to English literature.” We became fast
friends, and I felt very supported and didn't have to be too concerned with explaining how I
could change so radically, and I enjoyed my English literature very much.
BK: And so you ended up with a – English, B.A. in English lit.
BAC: Right.
BK: What do you do now? Do you teach –
BAC: Yes.
BK: – English?
BAC: I do, yeah. No, I don't teach English.
BK: No?
BAC: When I – I don't know if we want to skip down that far, but since it's on the same topic, I
guess we can. When I was going to college – because I thought I wanted to major in math, and I
thought it was going to be in statistics or in the financial field – I had a job in – insurance
company, in Providence, in the summers. And I would work in different departments each year.
Underwriting or in financial or whatever, so that I was being trained. There were four college
girls being trained [13:00] to come onboard as junior executives when they got out if they felt
they wanted that. So, I stayed the whole four years. And I had a job when I came out, and I was
going right back to the insurance company. And we were going to see just which department
needed me and which one I would fit into the best. However, when I was home in this – and my
family lived in Massachusetts, in Rehoboth, where the foundry was – the superintendent of the
schools in Rehoboth came to my home and said, “I have an opening in the second grade, and I
would like you to consider taking it.” I said, “I've had only four education courses and one child
10

psychology course. I'm not accredited.” He said, “I want a liberal arts person, because they can
adapt to anything. I've checked on your records, I would – I'm offering you a contract.” I said,
“Well, I do have a job.” “How long do you [14:00] have to give the notice?” I said, “At least two
weeks.” He said, “Good, that brings you to Labor Day, we start the Wednesday after.” I said, “I
have no idea, I've never practiced, taught.” He said, “I will give you two weeks – or maybe one
week with one of the best teachers I have in the system, and she will walk you through the
regimen,” which is what I did, and I taught second grade that year. I talked to the principal and I
said, “I really think I would be better suited teaching an older – the older children.”He said, “I've
got an opening at the junior high school.” That was seven, eight, and nine at the time.
So, I taught English, math, art, and phys. ed. Because it was a small school, we all had to
kind of double up on things, especially the new person, which was myself. So, it was quite a
variety, and I enjoyed that, and I did that for three years. We were trying to write a curriculum
for the math department, for [15:00] grades one through nine. And all of the teachers would
come to my room, and we'd sit down and decide what the textbooks would be, what we were
doing on a grade level. And by the time we got to the ninth grade, the superintendent got very
upset. And he issued an edict and said if there's any curriculum studies to be done, they'll be
done from this office. So, I went and I got another job in Warwick, Rhode Island. I said, “If that's
the way you're going to treat the teachers that you have, non-professionally, I'm going to look for
another job.” So, I went back to Warwick, to the high school I went to, knew the superintendent.
I walked in, I said, “Do you have any openings?” And he said, “Yes.” He said, “But it would be
math/science.” I said, “What do I do about my science? I've only had basic biologies and, you
know, so forth.” He said, “I'll get you an emergency provisional certificate in Rhode Island, and
you start taking courses.” OK, so I went in and I taught [16:00] math from the top to the bottom
and a basic science course, which was quite elementary in seventh grade. So, the children didn't
suffer that year because I wasn't that knowledgeable about advanced science. But we got through
that fine. And then I got pregnant. I had been married three years before, while I was teaching.
So, I gave my notice. I went home and started to raise our family, and when our daughter was
four, the superintendent in Rehoboth – or the principal in Rehoboth called and said, “I don't have
anyone who will take the phys. ed. Would you consider coming back part-time?” I said, “Sure.”
So, I arranged for sitters and went back part-time. I am still teaching part-time. But I teach four
11

days a week, and I taught, at that time, in the junior high. The junior high became ninth grade at
a regional high school. They opened up a middle school, and I had [17:00] fourth, fifth, and
sixth. Then they moved the fifth and sixth up to the seventh and eighth grade school. I didn't
want to take it full time, so I wrote a curriculum for the kindergarten through the fourth grade,
which is where I still am, and I teach four days a week.
BK: And you teach physical education?
BAC: Physical education to – but the training I had had in Warwick as a student – I also knew
the physical education teacher we had, personally, and she became the administrator of physical
education in the elementary schools in Warwick, in a big city. She had, like, 13 people under her.
I went right to her and said, “What do I do?” And she was up-to-date on all her methods, and we
sat down, she gave me everything, so I could adapt it all with my regular principals to what their
newest methods were. Exploratory, discovery, [18:00] all of the rest. Movement exploration.
And so, that's what I've been doing.
BK: Sounds pretty – (laughter) I could deal with that!
BAC: Sure!
BK: Teach physical education.
BAC: I'm sure you could. I think you'd enjoy it, too, and – depends on what level, you know? I
don't worry about my jocks, and I have only lead up and discovery games, so I don't go to
coaching. I have coached in a junior high school level, but I don't now, and I'm very happy with
it.
BK: Did you like coaching when you did?

12

BAC: I did. We coached softball teams in the town, and when I was at the intermediate school, I
started the girls' athletic program there as intramurals and did that. But that's about all, and that's
enough.
BK: That's enough?
BAC: That's enough, yes. I'm sure men prefer that than to the daily routine, but I like what I'm
doing with the smaller children.
BK: Kids are fun. They do some great stuff –
BAC: Oh, especially in a locale where you're not talking about inner city children [19:00] who
have had – parents are very supportive. The children are used to moving with their bodies. It's
not a strained environment, (phone rings) and they go on from there.
(break in audio)
BAC: Now, where were we?
BK: You were going to say – you were talking about the –
BAC: An example of something I am doing with the elementary children – every four years, it
coincides with the international Olympics. We have an Olympics in the town. Elementary
Olympics. And the children learn a folk dance from a country. Like, first graders are Greece – I
mean, the kindergarten children are Greece, because that's – they lead the procession, and they're
wearing sheets and – tied around the middle for their togas, and they've learned a Greek dance.
And we have England and Mexico, Norway, and the United States. And each of the grade levels
will do a dance from that. And we'll have our Olympic flag and we'll light the torch and –
BK: Wow.

13

BAC: – and then the following week, they'll have their games. They usually have field days, so I
just [20:00] combine it and they have all kinds of field and track things. Kicking balls, throwing
balls, jumping, running races, and that type of thing. So, that's what's been my biggest push this
year, and every four years that's – it takes a lot of time, because I have to rehearse – every child
is in it.
BK: Yeah.
BAC: It's not selected – the ones who can do it the best or the ones who choose to. It's part of
their class, and they do it – it's part of their rhythmics and part of their coordination. So, we just
develop it into a program. So, it's supposed to be next Wednesday. I hope it's a nice day.
BK: I do, too.
BAC: Yeah. (laughs)
BK: We had that at our school, but it wasn't as big. It wasn't as well organized. We just had an
Olympics every spring. Every grade level competed. It was a lot of fun.
BAC: Yeah.
BK: I had a lot of fun (inaudible)
BAC: I'll bet you did, yeah, knowing that you're, you know, attuned to that and, like –
BK: And I was a hyperactive child, so –
BAC: Yeah.
BK: – I liked all the (inaudible)

14

BAC: Yeah. Well, that's great. That's terrific. I think it more was – we're more physically active,
I think our minds would be more relaxed and we'd be in [21:00] better control over the situation.
BK: Right.
BAC: So –
BK: Were there any, like – I got – whenever – well, you can do just about anything at school
now. I mean, doesn't matter what you wear, doesn't matter, you know, who or what – were there
anything like that, regulations?
BAC: There were regulations that were passed down, sometimes to respond to conditions, such
as – we had a Shakespearean course in Pembroke Hall. And we were just across the campus at
Andrews, living over there. And a lot of girls – and it was only girls in the class – would roll out
of bed, throw on a raincoat, and go over. Well, the edict came, you must at least roll up your
jeans or pajamas, whatever's underneath, and you must take curlers out of your hair to sit in that
class. I mean, you had a lot of freedom, because there were no men around. But the – and the
professor was a professor emeritus, and he didn't quite [22:00] cotton to any of these new styles
of wearing clothes, such as dungarees that were showing underneath whatever. Yeah, he wanted
them – he thought we should come in skirts. Well, that was going a little bit much, so we wore
raincoats over everything and got away with it that way. But those were the types of things that
were just starting then. We had what was called gracious living Wednesday nights and Sunday
afternoons. And to that, you were supposed to wear a skirt of some kind, a dress or whatever.
And no sneakers, it should be stockings and shoes. Well, we didn't get out of basketball practice
'til quarter of six.
Fortunately, it was right on campus. Fortunately, people had brown outfits that we wore,
so that became our blouse, and we'd put a brown skirt over it and take the socks off and – trying
to get the stockings on and run downstairs, and felt that it really wasn't gracious living the way
we were there, (laughter) and the condition in which we were in. But, [23:00] they would invite
instructors or anyone connected with the university that you would like to talk to, and that person
15

would come and sit at the head of your table, and you'd discuss – supposedly informally, but it
was still the formal dining evening, and then we'd go into the lounges afterwards and meet with
them and have a coffee hour. And this was supposed to be our broadening experience in society
living. Sunday, very few people went to eat, because you had to do the same thing.
BK: Yeah?
BAC: (laughs) Yes. We always –
BK: (inaudible) it worked.
BAC: It was good in that it said you couldn't be sloppy all the time. But most of us would just as
soon have done it a different way, because by the time you got there and you didn't have time for
a shower and you couldn't really get dressed up – you didn't feel, as I say, particularly gracious.
But if you wanted to eat, you went that night and –
BK: Oh, I see, yeah.
BAC: – you did it, (laughs) and you had to eat, because at that time, there were very few options.
There [24:00] were a few – let's see, the Brown Jug. Well, you had – it's too far away. Lloyd's.
There were two or three places. You didn't have the time to really go there and then get your
studies done if you were playing a sport and doing everything else. So –
BK: It sounds tough.
BAC: And it was expensive. And so, we might go to The Gate, which is – I don't know if it's
there anymore. It's (inaudible) Pembroke.
BK: No, The Gate is still there, yeah.

16

BAC: Yeah. And we might go over there, but usually that's where we'd go on Sunday. We
managed to find enough to eat or get enough money so we could do something that we didn't
have to eat at the dining room, but –
BK: You had to pay – these extra place didn't use the credit?
BAC: No. No, no, it was – that was included. There was no punch-out, it was no – tickets for
dining. It was included with your tuition. You had tuition, room, and board. That was it. Your
room and board was paid, that's where your meals came from. And that was the basis of how you
ate.
BK: Wow.
BAC: Anything else was on your own, so –
BK: That's pretty –
BAC: So, you didn't have to make too many decisions. (laughter) [25:00] You went and ate,
usually. (laughs)
BK: Yeah. Did they keep the cafeteria open later for –
BAC: No, no.
BK: And you're – it was – you made it or you didn't eat.
BAC: That's right. And it was manned mostly, as far as waiters and waitresses were concerned –
I presume it still is – by the kids who wanted to – extra money, yeah.
BK: University food service jobs.

17

BAC: I don't know. Even waiters and waitresses, there's no chance for – can you be hired by
them to be – I know you couldn't be with your schedule, but can students be hired –
BK: Yeah.
BAC: Yeah, yeah.
BK: Students do a lot of the – but they do have a lot of people from the city that work the fulltime jobs.
BAC: Oh.
BK: So, every day, the people that dish out the food, there's – they're people from outside.
BAC: I think those were all hired full-time staff. It was the waitressing that was mostly – and
some of those girls couldn't have gone to school without having that extra money.
BK: Yeah.
BAC: So –
BK: Finance can be rough. But it's great today, there's financial aid and things like that. It really
helps out. That's great.
BAC: 'Til you have to pay it back. [26:00] Well, you don't. You probably are on – you're on
academic – I mean, athletic scholarship?
BK: No, you can't get football scholarships here.
BAC: Oh, they've changed that, yeah.

18

BK: But what they do do is they really get into your financial aid and find everything they can.
They did a really nice job on mine.
BAC: Oh, good. Well, they really must have wanted you if that's – to your credit.
BK: Well, they do that with everyone, because they look for people that they think are going to
survive at Brown, and people that – for improvement. They look for improvement, because I was
talking to my co-chapter (inaudible) Brown. They look for people that are going to improve and
that are going to grow. They don't want someone who's great now. You know, they want
someone who's good but can get better.
BAC: Yeah, and Brown emphasizes the academics, and therefore I can substantiate and follow
through with it. If they put that first, then I would have a problem.
BK: Right.
BAC: I think the reputation (inaudible)
BK: Yeah, I know, just as – well, they just upped the graduation [27:00] requirement to keep up
with these other schools. Everyone – the class – starting with the class of '92 has to pass 30
credits, where I only had to have 28 ours is the last class with 28, so I'm kind of lucky in that
sense.
BAC: Twenty-eight credits? How many do you get a course?
BK: One.
BAC: Oh. See, we got four. That's why I said that wouldn't make –
BK: Yeah, that'd be –

19

BAC: – too much sense, yeah.
BK: – seven courses, wow.
BAC: Yeah. (laughs) You're taking about four a semester?
BK: Yeah, I'm taking –
BAC: Yeah, that's about –
BK: – four. I'm an engineering major, so –
BAC: Very good. Oh, you –
BK: – I'm trying that.
BAC: Good luck to you.
BK: Thanks! (laughter)
BAC: Very good.
BK: So, women weren't – were restricted from classes at Brown or –
BAC: No, it depended on the department. Most science department courses and math were coed,
because of the numbers and the labs that you needed. Most of your liberal arts, your fine arts and
that were [28:00] not coed.
BK: I see.

20

BAC: And there were some things that took place at the Pembroke campus. The men came to –
like, classics would take place in Alumnae Hall, because you had 350 people in a lecture hall.
BK: Right.
BAC: But then, you would go into Pembroke Hall where a room would seat maybe 25, and you'd
have your – they had all the Shakespeare there.
BK: Did they have all the buildings on the green, was – did you get to use – like, the green – they
call the green, is out in front of Sayles Hall. Sayles Hall –
BAC: Well, we – let's see, I – where was my – biology must have been in Metcalf. I'm trying to
think – statistics was over – I don't remember which buildings they were in now. That’s several
years ago. (laughter) But we did go back and forth from one campus to the other. White Hall was
probably as far as we had to go.
BK: White Hall?
BAC: Yeah, that's [29:00] down off – Brown and – or, no, it's about three blocks down from the
quad, and that was one of the newest buildings in our – that was foreign languages at the time.
BK: Really?
BAC: I took my Spanish and art and French there.
BK: That's a pretty long walk from campus.
BAC: Oh, yes, yes. We had – sometimes, you had to schedule the classes that you could make,
you know? So –
BK: Did they have 10 minutes between the classes then?
21

BAC: Yes, but, of course, if you had a class at nine and then another at 11, you had your hour to
get there.
BK: Right.
BAC: You know? Which is what sometimes you did, because we had so far to go.
BK: Right, and how did they schedule the classes? Like, Monday, Wednesday, Friday? Had to –
BAC: That's what it was supposed to be, and Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday were supposed to
be the others.
BK: Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday?
BAC: Yes, we had Saturday classes, and then labs were in the afternoons.
BK: Yeah? Were they – every class was an hour?
BAC: Yes, yes, except for the labs, of course.
BK: Right.
BAC: Get into that. There was one thing that probably most city girl freshmen will remember,
[30:00] and that was having an eight o'clock biology class.
BK: Oh!
BAC: And I lived in Warwick, and the way the buses ran, I had to leave the house at five in the
morning, and got into Providence and then get up the hill, and then get over there, and I'd be
there at seven. But I couldn't get there at eight. There were no other buses in between. So, at the
22

corner of Angel and Thayer, there was a drugstore, and they did have some booths in the back.
So, I would sit there and have my coffee until it was time to go to class. By the time the classes
were over for the day, I was tired, because I would sleep on the bus going home at night.
BK: I can imagine.
BAC: So – and I – it wasn't too bad until my sophomore year, when I learned how to play bridge.
We had a city girl building where we could go in and – had a lounge and everything in it. And I
learned how to play bridge, and then I decided [31:00] that that was more fun than going home
on time. Or I'd do that in between waiting for a ball game, and by the time you got on the bus, it
was ten at night. It would be the last bus. You'd sleep on the bus, and you'd have to get up at five
the next morning. I didn't do quite so well that semester. I had an economics course, and I was
lucky to get through it. That's the only one I muffed up on the exam, but – did a good job on that
one.
BK: Oh, I could say the same. Doesn't look that way.
BAC: Oh, no. My principal, whom we knew personally said, “You know, you're going from a
little mud puddle and being the big frog, and you're going to go to a big, big puddle, and you're
going to be nothing for a long time. So, be very careful, and don't expect to do everything at
once.” 'Cause in a small community, you knew everybody and you knew everybody in your
class. We only had 94 in our high school graduating class. And you've been through six years
with these [32:00] same people. So, they were all like your family, and now you're going up
there – and I was the only one from my class that went there. And it was a different experience.
BK: That sounds familiar. My graduating class was 118.
BAC: Oh, so you came from a (inaudible)
BK: And I was valedictorian of my class, and –

23

BAC: Very good.
BK: – I was, like, you know, the big – I played three sports and I was good in three sports.
BAC: Yeah.
BK: Yeah, everything was this, and I – you know, I was, like, happy, and I went up here to – the
nice thing was I made a lot of friends. I have so many friends now, and we're all the same. I can
deal with that, you know?
BAC: That's good.
BK: I never liked to be – everybody said, this and that about, you know, oh, well, he's – I was
never called, you know, stuck up for –
BAC: No.
BK: – and he's the –
BAC: Yeah.
BK: I always was, like, well, I don't – you know, just – I'm myself.
BAC: That's good.
BK: I'd go hang out with everyone, like –
BAC: Yeah, that's good, that's good. And I think that gets to one of the questions in here. What
are your best memories and – or the experiences [33:00] you had at the university? And I think
it's the people you met.

24

BK: Yeah?
BAC: The people you lived with and the people you worked with, people you had classes with.
That's what makes the world go around, is the people, you know?
BK: You're still probably good friends with them today.
BAC: Several of them – they were in my wedding party and –
BK: Yeah.
BAC: But we – we're very active – reunioning class. And, in fact, we had one last year. And so,
quite a few of them came back, and we get together. And we have our class luncheon. That
happens to be in here somewhere, about the marriage of Brown and Pembroke classes that – after
– when was it? In '71, they merged. Now it became Brown University. There was no more
Pembroke. And the classes that graduated before that were asked whether they would consider
merging for the same reasons, that it was a lot easier and cheaper to keep statistics in one area
than it was in two separate areas [34:00] or two separate administration buildings. Well, we
debated for two years, and finally we decided that – we knew they wanted money when we reuned, you know, for a gift. And we didn't have too much money, and the men had a lot. So, we said
we will marry you for your money. And since then, we have had a merged reunion. And we
have, I think, two women and two men that are the officers of the class, the reunion class. And
we have strictly said that we will always have a Pembroke class luncheon on the Saturday, and
they are not to interfere with us. We will plan it and we will go and do as we want. The rest of
the time, we will join the men. And it's worked out very well.
BK: Oh, sure.
BAC: And we get 40, 50 people coming back for a reunion, and I think that's pretty good. We
had 200 in our class.

25

BK: Yeah, 200?
BAC: So, that's – 204, I believe it was.
BK: Sure.
BAC: So – and that was Pembroke.
BK: Right.
BAC: Brown was four to one, you know, and we're talking [35:00] about they were four times
the size of us.
BK: So, that means there were about 800 in your class (inaudible) so –
BAC: Well, about 800 men.
BK: Right.
BAC: And therefore, about 1,000 –
BK: Thousand –
BAC: – graduating.
BK: Oh, yeah. There's 1,500 something – so that's really not much bigger.
BAC: No.
BK: Yeah.

26

BAC: And you've had to increase your dorms to be able to do it, you know? The space wasn't
there.
BK: Yeah.
BAC: You couldn't have increased it until you increased the buildings. And since you increase
the buildings, you now increase your enrollment.
BK: There were probably a lot more local people that went, because, like –
BAC: I don't know what the percentage is. I don't know what it was then. We had a very active
city girl group, but it wasn't that large. It was just that if you didn't join together and stick
together, there was no place for you to go. So, we managed to raise money enough – and one of
the old dorms, one of the old homes that the university owned, or the college owned – the dean
had allowed the city girls to use it as a – sleepovers, [36:00] and we had the kitchen facilities.
And therefore, we had our own dorm. That came about while I was a sophomore. So, we worked
very hard for that.
BK: Yeah.
BAC: So – and that made it much easier.
BK: So, you're saying, like, your best memories at Brown were – is that what you were –
BAC: My best memories are of the people that I either lived with or worked with. And when I
work, I'm talking about either as a class officer or as – on a team. In class, yes, you're on your
own pretty much in the class.
BK: Right.

27

BAC: And as far as studying with anybody, I still did most of my stuff – I think most people
who've been brought up that way continue that way. There are times that you might want to have
a seminar and discuss it and whatever, but I think most of the time I studied alone. But after the
studying, the group that – would stay together. And there were quite a few of us that would go to
The Gate at night or would go [37:00] downstairs or do something. And we were pretty – we
were close enough so that those are the ties that we kept since then. So, that's what it has meant
to me.
BK: Were there any sororities –
BAC: No, no.
BK: There were no sororities.
BAC: No sororities. The school was too small. See, there were fraternities, but no sororities.
BK: No sororities.
BAC: And I think it was good that way. We had inter-dorm competitions. West Andrews would
play East Andrews would play Metcalf or things of that nature. If we wanted to get a – pick-up
games or – that was up to the dorm council. One of my friends was the president of the dorm
council, and she would say, well, let's get all the reps together and decide whether they want to
do something. And then they'd all set up a team and set up your own schedule. We were very
flexible in what we would do. We had the rights to run it, as long as we stayed within the
parameters, and I – that's what I miss the most, if – a person couldn't go to a small college in a
big university, and was just a number in a [38:00] big university – I think that's one of the things
you give up, you – we had our own newspaper. We had our own athletic association.
BK: Yeah?
BAC: And you had your own class officers.
28

BK: Right.
BAC: So, you did a lot more things with a small group of people, and you had a big – a lot more
latitude that way. And it didn't have to be a major, earthshaking change like you'll get in your –
any of your new – your publications at Brown and Brown Daily Herald or anything. It wouldn't
have to be of that nature. You weren't looked on that you were the professional edition of
somebody's talents who was writing for something and was looking for recognition. We could
write what we wanted for our own group. And it was fine. I enjoyed that part of it, and yet I had
all the professors that Brown could afford. And I could go to them and use – utilize their
knowledge and information and research, and still come back to my own little home.
BK: Yeah. [39:00]
BAC: So, I think it was great. It was me. That was one of the reasons I did say I would apply to
Pembroke, because it was a small school, and I came from a small area.
BK: Right.
BAC: And I felt at home, even though it had a large family attached to it. Just a small unit and a
small group, and I liked it very much.
BK: Yeah, OK. You never went back to school at Brown after –
BAC: I got married when we graduated. My childhood sweetheart was in the service, and he
came home. He got established, started working, and went to school nights. And so, I took the
teaching jobs, and he could go to school, as well as work a full-time job, so –
BK: [Where did he get his?]
BAC: And he went to URI and Roger Williams.
29

BK: Yeah?
BAC: So, he got his engineering degree and his business, so – for 13 years, going nights, because
he was also traveling for the [40:00] company, and it meant that sometimes he couldn't take three
courses a semester. So, it strung out over 13 years for both degrees.
BK: Wow.
BAC: So – but I wouldn't want to do it again, but I'm glad we did it the way we did it.
BK: Oh, sure.
BAC: That's another reason I taught part-time, because I had other obligations, like the family.
BK: Did you have May Day?
BAC: Yes, yeah.
BK: What was that exactly?
BAC: Now, let me see if I can remember. You would have a May Queen, and of course this was
all in Pembroke, so you didn't have to worry about girlfriends of Brown boys or their coming
over, whatever. And they would select her court, you know, I – really going back. They would
have a maypole, which is – dates back, I believe, to some kind of a – well, anti-Christ type thing.
You know, this is not a religious [41:00] background to May Day. But anyway, and then I guess
the Brown brokers and the dance association – I can't remember what they were called, the dance
club – would put on all kinds of entertainment during it. And the maypole would be part of it. So,
other than that, I really can't remember too much about it. I was never queen, I was never in the
court. My friends – some of my friends were, and I used to go to them all, but it was one activity,
that was about it.
30

BK: I see. Was it Ivy Day?
BAC: Yes.
BK: (inaudible)
BAC: I was just going to – what I remember about Ivy Day – and I'm – I believe that's what this
is. When we were graduating, we had our own class days. We had our own honors awards, you
know? You'd get your jacket or whatever. And we would make a chain. The freshmen or
sophomores would make a chain, [42:00] and the seniors would walk through it into the Alumni
Hall, which was our chapel. And there, all the ceremonies would take place, and whatever
awards were going to be given, and the dean would speak and the senior class president would
speak. And so, I remember that part of it, and I presume that's what you're talking about that –
BK: Yes, yes.
BAC: I remember going over the speech with the dean, and that's probably one of the hardest
things to write, because you don't want to say the same thing – probably as valedictorian of the
high school you had a problem writing it.
BK: Right.
BAC: Well, I had a problem writing this one, too, so – but –
BK: What did you write it on?
BAC: I – whatever it – was important to me at the time, and where we were going from there.
Whatever it was, now, I don't remember, so –

31

BK: I wrote mine on the championship. That was, like, the title. And it was based on a song by
Queen called “We Are the Champions” (inaudible)
BAC: Yeah.
BK: But my senior year, we were undefeated in football, we were undefeated in track, and we
were, like, [43:00] 16 and one in wrestling.
BAC: Wow, wow.
BK: And (inaudible).
BAC: Boy (inaudible).
BK: 'Cause my senior class just – we had, like, 11 or 12 boys who just – we grew up together,
and I'd played football since I was eight years old, and I'd played with the same people. And we
just really had a successful senior year. And we had people in academics who – we went to some
competitions and really did well. And being from a small school, it was really great. So, that's
what –
BAC: Yeah, that's great. Oh, very good.
BK: And so –
BAC: And you – I think it's a difficult thing to talk to your peers about your feelings, and yet you
want them to relate to it, and still give them a message of some kind that you haven't experienced
yet, you know? It's different if somebody comes back and says, “This is what it's really like out
there.” But you haven't been out there yet, so it's hard to decide what kind of advice do you give
them? And yet, they all feel the same as you do, so how do you stand up and say something that's
going to interest them? I think it's a difficult choice. I think [44:00] one of the outstanding things
– well, we had there was – we did have a change of deans, and that was a very impressive
32

procession. We made an ivy chain for that one, as well, but the seniors did that, because the
gowns and robes that were there that day – because they came from all over the place for the new
dean, because Dean Lewis was ill.
BK: Really?
BAC: Yeah, so – but I remember that one. That was – and the other thing I remember, as far as
any activities, was graduation, leading down the hill – the senior class marshal and the senior
president lead the class down.
(break in audio)
BAC: And walked through the ranks of the Brown men and walked into the Baptist
meetinghouse ahead of them. They went down ahead of us, but then formed on the sides. Broke
ranks, and we went through them and went down and sat down first. So, it was kind of – well, we
got there, and here we are, in here, and we're first in the baccalaureate service, and it was, I think,
a nice way to do it.
BK: Yeah.
BAC: And we continued doing it that way. Afterwards, I went back and I was the alumni
marshal the next year. Quite often, whoever was there the year before will – and we did the same
thing, only we led the grads down first, and – the old grads, and then we led the women down,
and then the men came in behind that. Yeah, I – you don't have that anymore.
BK: Right.
BAC: They're all together, which I suppose is nice, but it was kind of nice that way, too.
BK: Did you – so, then you didn't, like – they had the – it's like a big – trying to say – it's a big
deal to walk through the gates when you're a freshman –
33

BAC: Oh, yeah.
BK: – and walk through –
BAC: And then you walk – yes, then we would take –
BK: Did you walk through?
BAC: Oh –
BK: Did you get to walk through?
BAC: As a freshman, they were open. I don't believe I walked through them, because Pembroke
was six blocks further over. Going down, of course, through graduation, that's where the
procession goes.
BK: Right.
BAC: You go right through the gates. They're open and you form on the green and you go down
– so, you go down then. But freshmen arrive at all different times, and obviously, you know
(inaudible)
BK: We had a big deal on –
BAC: – maybe – oh, you did now?
BK: – so, a kind of a – like a graduation, only – you know, it was just the freshmen, and we all
formed up in rows of four across, I think, and – all the way downhill, and –
BAC: Oh!
34

BK: – they opened the gates up, and everybody walked through.
BAC: Very nice.
BK: You were all supposed to be there. It wasn't mandatory. It would – yeah, I thought it was
nice.
BAC: Well, that's good. That's good. It's your reception into Brown.
BK: Right, and they had – all the deans were there, with the robes, and the president made a
speech and something like that. And it was going on – it was hot and I had to get to practice, so I
–
BAC: Yeah. (laughs)
BK: –- get to see the end of it.
BAC: Yeah.
BK: That's right.
BAC: Yeah, you're going to, I'm sure, miss some things, because your time is not your own to
choose.
BK: Yeah, especially – orientation week was a big deal on – that's when football – the
conditioning and getting ready, so I missed orientation week.
BAC: Yeah, well, I don't know as you missed that much. (laughs) It depends on who was
conducting it and how – used to be – this was one nice thing at Pembroke at the time. They had
what they called a question club, and it was made up of the presidents of all the associations on
35

the campus. And we would go back a week early, and we would decide what we were going to
do for the freshmen. And then, we would take the freshmen and walk them through everything or
stay with them and eat with them and advise them and help them move and everything else. And
we had little gold question marks that were on our lapels so that if they didn't know where they
were, what they were supposed to do, they knew that we were the people that they could come
to. There'd be about a dozen of us, and that was a pretty good experience. That was kind of fun.
BK: Yeah.
BAC: You didn't mind going back a week early, because you had your own things first, and we
had a good time. And then you worked with the freshmen coming in, which – of course, you
don't do that anymore, because [48:00] the number's prohibitive.
BK: Right.
BAC: There's too many of them.
BK: Yeah.
BAC: That's another thing you've missed.
BK: And the – they go – they have advising programs now, and I have an advisor who I've seen
twice. He would sign my sheet for courses (inaudible) with a big school and – well, the thing I
did, I talked to my coaches and I talked to my professors, and they're more help than adviser –
BAC: Yeah.
BK: – who doesn't –
BAC: They know you better, right? And you can talk to them and say what you can do. If you
don't – are unable to do, or do like or don't like.
36

BK: Right.
BAC: And they know, because they're in the department.
BK: Yeah.
BAC: Yeah. No, I didn't have much luck with that. [48:35]

Track 2
BAC: [00:00] – in the math department, and I didn't feel as though it was much help, other than
telling me what I had to take if I wanted to go through the program.
BK: Yeah, that's – math is tough. I had a problem – we had to take Math 10. I barely made it
through (inaudible).
BAC: Yeah. Well, you need it for your engineering, so –
BK: Yeah, and –
BAC: But I didn't need it for English literature.
BK: Right.
BAC: No, no, don't need that. Chapel and convocation, too, I think they're very important. I think
they're important, because you get a feel for your speakers, who usually are in the administration
of the building.
BK: What were –
37

BAC: Of the university. And I think they sometimes can set the tone of what their expectations
are, and you get an idea of what the university's about. I think you can. It depends entirely on
what kind of a speaker the person is.
BK: Right.
BAC: But I think they can be important. And just the assembling of everybody, of course,
[01:00] is important, if you can get them all in someplace. But your numbers must change some
of that.
BK: Yeah, it's really hard to do that. I don't know if – there isn't a building on campus except for
– maybe the athletic center, if everyone was down on the floor and three or four basketball
players –
BAC: Yeah.
BK: Have you stayed in contact with your Pembroke teachers or deans or –
BAC: No. No, not at all. There was one in the education – I mean, in the athletic department, and
I did know her and see her a couple of times when she took a job in the Boston area. But since
then, I haven't seen her at all, so – but nobody on the faculty as such. Well, some of them are no
longer with us. They were already in their 50s and 60s 30 years ago.
BK: Yeah.
BAC: So, they're not here anymore.
BK: This is true, yeah.

38

BAC: Yeah, so, the one who was the head of the athletic department was Bessie Rudd [02:00] –
was her name, and she became, like, a great aunt to many of us who were in the athletic
programs. And one of my classmates is now the – I don't know what her title is. Assistant
director of athletics. Arlene Gorton, at Brown. And – yeah, at Brown. And she stayed in contact
with Miss Rudd, and I would see Arlene, and that was about the only way I'd get back with it,
but no, other than that, I don't have much contact. Reunions, I go, and I'm not a class agent
anymore, so I – once in a while get involved in raising money, but not too often. I did it for 10
years after I got out. I was a class agent, which means that you're trying to raise money from
your own class by sending letters and calling them and contacting and whatever, so (inaudible).
BK: But what'd you think about [03:00] – whatever, Pembroke and Brown version of (inaudible)
did you like it personally, or –
BAC: Well, I wasn't there.
BK: OK.
BAC: And my statements before saying that I had the best of both worlds would stand up
anytime that – I went to a small college, we had the benefit of the money behind a full university
with the facility as well as the instructors.
BK: I see. So, you didn't feel that Pembroke was being shortchanged or anything, and that –
since you went to Pembroke, you didn't –
BAC: Yeah. At the time I was there, I didn't think it was shortchanged at all. I thought we had
the latitude that we needed to have, and yet we had everything that we could want out of a
university. So, I liked it. I liked it. We had our dorm council, we made our own rules. If there
was an infraction, we sat down and discussed it. It was much more personal.
BK: Yeah, that's true. Well, when you have the large numbers, you start –

39

BAC: (inaudible)
BK: – to become [04:00] a number.
BAC: And I'm still not sure how much they saved by –
BK: By the merger?
BAC: By the merger. I don't know. I'm sure there are statistics that I could get that would
substantiate all its well saved money. But I feel as though I had the best experience by being
there before the merger, so –
BK: So, after Brown, you started to teach.
BAC: Yes, and I'm still doing that. And I said my husband went to school after he got out of the
Army. And then I raised a family, and I think – getting down to our volunteer type things.
BK: Yeah.
BAC: And I'm active in the community. We can go in reverse order. We started a women's club
in the town, worked up to president of that. Then we thought we needed to have somebody active
a little more in the government [05:00] affairs, so we started the League of Women Voters in
town, and I worked up to president of that. And from there, I went on the planning board in the
town. After I was chairman of that, I ran for selectman. Now, I don't know if you know anything
about town politics. We don't have a mayor, and we have a board of three people who are the
decision makers and policy makers, and they're called the selectmen.
BK: Kind of like the triumvirate.
BAC: Well, (laughter) their powers are quite limited, because we still have a town meeting that
is the legislative body that they have to report to, and without the money and without the laws
40

that the town meeting passes, you don't have the power that you might have. However, it's an
interesting job. I had it for three years, and I enjoyed it, but it's very time consuming if you're
going to do a good job, because you're responsible for public safety, which is police and fire. The
highway department, your [06:00] recreation department, your mental health department, and
you work with a water district, and most important you work with the school department. You
hope you do, because both areas of the town are where the monies go. And so, you try to
cooperate, come out with long-range plans so the tax money goes where it should go, and it
doesn't always work that way. And now I'm on the finance committee for the town, who advises
the town meeting what they should be doing. And we're working very closely with the school
committee, who is trying to build up to a $9.4 million project starting next year for extra
classrooms.
BK: Wow.
BAC: And we're also working with a study committee on police and fire facility for probably
two and a half to five million dollars, depending what they come up with. And we're already – in
Massachusetts, we have a limit. We have a – what's called the two and a half limit. It was called
a proposition at the time it was passed. You can't raise taxes [07:00] more than two and a half
percent every year. So, obviously, you can't just say, well, we need $100,000 this year, and you
say, oh, we can only raise 90,000. I'm just using figures. We go higher than that – because the
state says you can't go any more than that. Then you say, well, what do I do? Cut services? Do
we not hire the policeman? Do we not hire the fireman? Do we not buy a police cruiser? Do we
not hire a superintendent? This type of thing, and these are the kinds of decisions that are very
difficult in the state of Massachusetts because of Proposition 2 ½. And this is common
throughout the Commonwealth right now, because the state aid is going down. And with
Governor Dukakis's proposed budget coming up with a deficit, we're going to get no state aid.
So, next year we're going to be faced with an override, and that goes on the ballot, and the people
have to decide, do they want their taxes raise or not? So, you have to get a lot of information out
to the –
BK: Right.
41

BAC: And they vote on it, but you've got to give them the information ahead of time.
BK: Yeah, [08:00] you’re seriously going to say raise my taxes? You've got to be crazy!
BAC: Right, and then you say, “Well, we're not going to come around and pick up your
garbage.” “Oh, well, you've got to do that!” “Well, your children are going to walk to school for
two miles.” “Oh, they'd better walk” – “You're not having any more policemen.” “Well, I need a
policeman in town.”
BK: Yeah.
BAC: And then they say – OK, this is what you're buying now, and this is what it's costing you.
What do you want to give up? Nothing? Well, then you have to go pay for it.
BK: Right.
BAC: And so, you have to get this information to them so they can make decisions.
BK: Yeah.
BAC: So, that's what the finance committee does.
BK: Yeah, sure.
BAC: So, and right now with the capitol building that's going on, it's taking time. I have two
meetings this week, and I will have two next week at the minimum. We also have a cable
company in town that's been here for three years. I was on the board of selectmen when we
awarded the contract, and the – couple of the people who were on the advisory committee to the
selectmen stayed on on the local access channel. That means we have a studio in town, [09:00]
and we can put on whatever we want. Well, there was an advisory committee that runs that. So,
42

I'm on that, helping out with the programming. So, that could take 50 hours a week or it could
take nothing for months, depending on how active we want to be and can be. That's all voluntary.
All of this is volunteer –
BK: So, it's kind of like a PBS station or –
BAC: Yes, yes, only it's not necessarily – although we could buy tapes and show them, we're
trying to put on our own programs. We funded a coordinator in the school department, and
they're going to put on Tuesday nights – school affiliated programs, and the children, from
kindergarten through the high school, will be manning – either manning the cameras or
performing in front of the teachers. And those things will be put on Tuesday night. They're going
to – that's going to be their night. And we're filming selectmen's meetings, school committee
meetings. We're now deciding whether or not [10:00] we'll do any other board meetings. So, you
can sit at home and find out what's going on. We do all the town meetings. We do the candidates'
debates, so –
BK: Wow, sounds like –
BAC: (inaudible)
BK: – you should hire Brent Musburger and –
BAC: Yeah. (laughs)
BK: – film your –
BAC: Yeah. (laughs)
BK: – Olympics.
BAC: Of course, that's in another town, my Olympics. I teach in Rehoboth.
43

BK: Oh, OK, so you can –
BAC: Live in Seekonk. Never live in the town that you teach in.
BK: Really?
BAC: Well, you have to hear – decide what you can spend. Over there, I spend it. I don't want to
be caught in the middle.
BK: Oh, that's true. Oh, yeah.
BAC: It's very different. Very different.
BK: Over there, it's – they're –
BAC: Yes, and I need to –
BK: – you don't worry about –
BAC: Yeah.
BK: – someone else worries about making those decisions.
BAC: Right, right, right. It's true, that – well, I don't know what else I do. That usually takes me
– but when you called, tonight was the only night I was home. And I was going to relax, and I
said, no, if I don't do it tonight, I won't be able to see him for two weeks. So, probably you'd
better come tonight. So, that's why you're here, [11:00] so –
BK: That worked all right.

44

BAC: Yes.
BK: Well, what about your children? You have three children.
BAC: OK, I have a daughter who is going to tractor trailer school, because she wants to be – has
wanted to always be mechanically inclined. She used to work in automotive parts departments,
and now she decided she'd like to drive. I have another daughter who's going – and has gone
back to school for an associate in electrical engineering, because she has her programming for
computers, but she would rather set up the systems. So, that's where she is tonight. She goes four
nights a week to New England Tech.
BK: Great!
BAC: She'll do that for a year and a half, and then get an associate's in that. And we have a son
who is in his second year at the Air Force Academy.
BK: Wow!
BAC: So, that's him up there.
BK: That's great.
BAC: So, yeah, he's a – if he completes this year – and he's taking his finals this week – and
stays after graduation, then he is in and has to – and has a commitment of five years in the
service or nine years [12:00] of – as a pilot, if he makes it.
BK: Does he want to fly?
BAC: Yeah.

45

BK: OK. I wanted to fly, too, but I didn't apply for the academy. So, I'd rather – I wanted to fly
for the Navy.
BAC: Oh.
BK: I still might fly for the Navy. But I might get an aeronautical engineering degree.
BAC: That's –
BK: But that's –
BAC: That's what he's majoring in right now, yeah, right.
BK: Well, that has to – at the Air Force Academy, has to be very –
BAC: But – yeah. It's tough. It's very tough.
BK: Yeah, I'm sure it is.
BAC: It's very tough. Yes, two weeks ago he called, and – not one of – not his roommate and not
one of his close friends, but somebody he'd been with the night before shot himself in his room.
BK: Really?
BAC: Yes. Some of these things don't necessarily go out in the public papers, but it's – you
know, everybody knows about it. And unfortunately, there is a lot of pressure. And he was from
a military family, and said, “They would never understand that I didn't want to stay here.”
BK: Wow.

46

BAC: Yeah, it's tough. There's an awful lot of pressure in – because they have [13:00] six or
seven courses, plus their military studies, plus their –
BK: Physical –
BAC: – intramurals that they have to go, yes –
BK: Right, physical part.
BAC: – the physical stuff. And he has a girlfriend.
BK: Has a girlfriend?
BAC: Yes.
BK: Well, that's one (inaudible).
BAC: Well, it's good, except it makes it that much more time consuming.
BK: Much more time – yeah, it does –
BAC: Yes.
BK: – take a lot of time.
BAC: Yes. He'll be home June six for three weeks. She's coming out on the 16th. (laughter) She's
never been to the East Coast.
BK: Really?

47

BAC: We've been there – and her family, so we're kind of looking forward to it. He was home at
Christmas for two weeks. Now he'll be home now, and that'll be it. Then he'll go back and he'll
work with the freshmen and beast at the basic training. Then he goes to an Air Force base. And
then on the – middle of August, they start classes.
BK: Right.
BAC: So, it's a full-time commitment.
BK: Yeah.
BAC: So, we have a diversity of children and their – what should I say? Their chosen careers.
BK: Wow, that's great!
BAC: (laughs) I guess it is. It's kind of [14:00] nerve-wracking at times and – for them to decide
what they're going to do, but we've tried to say it's your life and we'll support you as far as we
can.
BK: Yeah, that's right.
BAC: So, I wouldn't – I would never choose someone – career, because I don't know – I'm not in
that person's shoes, and I'm glad what I did and I'm glad that I've had the other opportunities,
because I enjoy one as much as the other. The community activities are very interesting, because
you're helping people.
BK: Right.
BAC: That's what it's all about. And yet, you know what's going on, so it's kind of interesting.
And so – and I work with little ones during the day, so –

48

BK: Yeah.
BAC: – I get the combination. And I think I had a good education. I think a great deal of the
university. When I was raising money during the '70s, when there was a lot of unrest, I had a lot
of very uncomplimentary returned [15:00] phone calls of, “Why would you raise money for that
kind of a student body?” And I said, “They've got the same rights we have. They got to find their
way, and in the meantime, I think the administration's directing them and going to help them all.”
And so, maybe we've had a complete turnaround, and I think right now – got the credibility that
used to be there, and I hated to see it go for awhile, but I'm so glad it's back.
BK: Yeah.
BAC: I think when you say Brown University, you say something.
BK: Yeah.
BAC: So, I hope you make it all the way.
BK: (laughs) Me, too.
BAC: I think it's great. I'm sure you will. Just don't be afraid to go for help anytime.
BK: Yeah.
BAC: Yeah. There's always some people out there ready to help, and –
BK: Yeah, it's – [15:48]
