STINE: Today’s January, 21st and I’m here with Harriette Stewart. This is
our second interview and I’m gonna just back in and talk a little bit more ask
about your job at the first aid station. One of the things that I was curious
about that we hadn’t talked about is were there any disabled people working in
the shipyard that you remember.

STEWART: I don’t remember anybody really disabled, there might had been some
maybe one arm or something from a previous accident, that they had all their
life or something, because anybody that applied was given work at the shipyard.
The men were a little older then; they weren’t twenty-one, because those boys
were in the service. Most of them are grown men or in their forties or were 4F
for some reason. But the mob of men that were there when I started, July of
1942, you see that’s six months after Pearl Harbor, and the shipyard was going
full blast. In Richmond, there was Yard Two, One, Three, and Four, so there were
all full of people. That takes in a lot of people, workers. I imagine everybody
in Richmond, every man was working there. Then they started taking in the women.
The women at first were in the office, but offices were outside the shipyard;
they were not allowed in the shipyard, just men and us nurses. That was it. Then
things changed as the war progressed, but they kept wanting to get those ships
built and outta there into use, and they did. My goodness, those droves of men
that came. Everyone was dropped off at the shipyard entrance. You didn’t drive
in the shipyard, at Yard One where I worked, you were dropped off at 10th and
Cutting and that’s where the gates were for everybody to go through, to get in
to their work. But no cars allowed in there unless you were top notch and you
didn’t see that very often.

STINE: When you first got to the shipyards, the work force was like you said
already kinda in full force. Were there people that had started to work there
before the women got there that were either disabled or elderly or -- ?

STEWART: They were more the fifty-sixty age brackets -- forty, fifty, sixty, a
tremendous share was fifty and sixty years old. I don’t think anybody worked
part-time, it was either full time or no. There was no physical for the job, it
was you went down there and signed in and wanted a job, and they gave you a
badge and that was it, you were in. If you look good, I suppose if you look like
a cripple or something, they might have questioned that. That was in an office
apart where they interviewed the people about signing up for work. We saw the
people after they were on the job, but the people wanted to work. The fever that
they had was win this war and this was their way of helping. They were too old
for the draft, for the service part. It was a whole new phase of life;
everything was so different. Of course, it wasn’t long. The town’s changed
too because the crowds of people that came.

STINE: Do you remember any people working there just people in Richmond that had
come from the Midwest or come from the South?

STEWART: I didn’t know anybody that came from the Midwest, no. But a lot of
people came from Oklahoma, they went down there recruited people right and left.
You told them you can have a job, there’s housing for you, and a job. Before
that, a lot of people were relief rolls in the Midwest, county aid of some sort.
This was an opportunity to make some money, so they jumped at that and out they
came. If the wife didn’t come with him, she was there before long. Because
when they got out here, they could see that the whole family could live here,
and that’d be the way to live. I think Richmond went from 15,000 to 70,000.
The first bang was 70,000 or so, and on up to 120 I think. San Francisco
swelled, Berkeley swelled, Oakland, every place swelled, the schools,
everything. Housing wasn’t really that ready for them -- the first impact, and
they stayed with relatives, or slept on the street or in the movie theaters
until the housing was put up. Richmond housing authority put up houses on every
vacant lot, around the shipyard, the whole south side was housing. If you owned
an empty lot, it wasn’t yours anymore. A unit was put up on it, depending on
the size of the lot whether it was a six apartment or twelve or what. There were
two stories, and there were one bedroom, maybe two bedrooms for two or three
units in a big, big building, but the rest were mostly one unit. But people
lived in whether they had two or three kids, they lived in one bedroom place.
There were clothesline in the back, and one washroom where there were laundry
trays, and that was it, where people could go down on scrub board and wash their
clothes and take them --

STINE: In the public housing, you mean?

STEWART: Yes. But people were so used to it that was fine.

STINE: I’m wondering with all these people coming in if you ever saw the
effects of people coming in, say maybe from the South or from the Midwest that
had the effects of malnutrition or maybe came with health problems or was that
anything that you saw?

STEWART: Oh, they came with everything that just to get here, they came. Of
course, people were ready to criticize anybody or laugh at anybody with a
different pronunciation of words. Anyway, that’s the way it was. They’re an
Okie, but the Okies proved that they were good people, and they worked, and they
wanted to work. It wasn’t that they came out and you feed me, they wanted to
work. Everybody came with the idea of working then, helping out somehow. With
all the restrictions that were on people -- like you had to have blue chip stamp
book for food, had to go to the board to get an extra tire, gasoline for your
car, all those things that people cope with and nobody complained even shoes you
had -- . I know I had go for another pair of shoes, and then you didn’t hear
anything about that -- that was just a short time or so. But that’s the way it was.

STINE: Can you explain the process of going for shoes?

STEWART: In Berkeley, it was down near the post office building that they opened
for more people to apply for blue chip stamp books and that, and it was all
government stuff. I need a slip for a pair of shoes that was all it was. You had
to give an address if you wanted a blue chip stamp book, I think, a name and an
address. You had to prove that you had a car if you wanted a tire and for gas
and you were limited to so many gallons a week of gas. That it was like the blue
chip stamp book, the gas thing.

STINE: If you work for Kaiser, were you able to get more gasoline or were you
able to -- ?

STEWART: No. If you lived in Berkeley and you drove your car to the shipyard and
you had riders, you were entitled to extra gas to go and pick the people up and
take them there. But that was it, you had to prove that -- . Nobody complained
even at the meat counters and in the food places; people just accepted the
government’s rule, and they were so glad that there wasn’t shooting right
here under our noses like a lot of places had in foreign countries. The war
stories were scary then. Oh, terrible! So many people killed, so many husbands
that were overseas in the war, and the families got worried they were shot, it
affected everybody here. It was kind of serious living, and you abided by the
rules; that was it. I don’t think that would go over so good now because
people want more than they are entitled to or complain easy. That was the way it
was. There were no new cars.

STINE: I was gonna ask you had mentioned earlier that your husband had a car, do
you remember what kind of car it was?

STEWART: He had a car. ‘39 Ford, four-door Ford. He did have a car. He was
pronounced 4F right away, so they said you could go get a job in a war industry,
so that was how he came from Union Pacific job, the train company, to the area
here for getting a job. At first, he was single and they gave him board and room
in some place, I can’t remember where it was. A slip for that to come out to
Yard One and get a job, which worked out, that’s the way it was done then.
Then he got his own place in Berkeley on Woolsey, so that was where he lived.
No, it was a godsend. If you didn’t have a car, you were grounded or public
service. The train service even to the San Francisco was beautiful then, it was
good, much easier than it is today. There was a train that stop down at the top
of Solano came down to University and picked up everybody there and Shattuck and
you rode on that, and you rode over the Golden Gate Bridge or the Bay Bridge on
that train and got off on 3rd Street over there and you could walk up to Market
in two blocks, but you couldn’t believe it how good it was. People use it and
that was it. That’s the way it was. When you went to the city though, you
didn’t go for an hour, you went for the whole rest of the day. But you were
safe at night coming home, a single person was safe. We didn’t even think
about getting robbed or any trouble. There was just wasn’t any either.

STINE: Did you feel that safety in Richmond?

STEWART: At first, yes. Down in the shipyard waiting for the bus to come to pick
you or any, yeah. It was just automatic; it was that way. No matter who you
were, if you were alone or if you were eighty years old or what. When people
then, if they need grocery, keep on finish your shift, you got your groceries
and you went home. The theaters played all night.

STINE: You get your groceries in Richmond at the end of your shift and you take
them home?

STEWART: Yes. When I lived in Berkeley then on Spruce Street right down near the
campus, I got off on University and there was a Safeway store ahead Macdonald
years ago on the left hand side the last block that was it -- two blocks from home.

STINE: Were there any stores that were in proximity to the shipyard that were
frequented a lot?

STEWART: No. No. Nothing around the shipyard. It was all bare land or the
housing went up. As I said before, in ‘42 in July, Cutting Boulevard was only
two lanes wide. They didn’t have the need for all that traffic at first, but
things did change.

STINE: I was curious so I just want to back up a little bit, because both you
and your husband lived in Berkeley and commuted to Richmond, and I was wondering
I know that you kind of fortuitously got this apartment in Berkeley -- you had
friends that had been living there, they left and you got the apartment, but I
was wondering if you ever thought to move to Richmond or if your husband had
ever thought to move to Richmond?

STEWART: No. No. We were very happy there in Berkeley.

STINE: Initially when you first came, did you think that might be better to be
closer to work?

STEWART: No. You were so lucky to have an unit to live in that you didn’t even
think about moving; you stayed right where you were until the surroundings in
your life change then you would change. But no, you didn’t change. We came to
Richmond because the twins were born, and we had to find a place right away.
Housing was so rare, oh, my word. You couldn’t find a place.

STINE: This was 1946?

STEWART: ‘46. I had taken care of a lady in Kaiser Oakland in the delivery who
had a baby and her husband worked for the housing authority. She told me, “You
go see my husband, he’s head of the housing authority and he’ll get you a
place to live in Richmond.” So, we did and ended up on South 13th right where
the 580 goes now, [inaudible] in that area. But I thought was perfect, because I
was so close to Kaiser Hospital with the twin for medical care. We could see
that we were lucky to have a roof over our head and we were savers and managers;
we didn’t throw our money around at all. No way. We saved money and we bought
a lot on 14th and Virginia and cleared it and put a duplex on it, and that was
1950 that we were in housing four years.

STINE: Do you remember what that housing look like in the first, had been public housing?

STEWART: Yes.

STINE: Can just describe what it was like?

STEWART: Let me bring a book in here. I saw the other day, and show you
something about housing. I wondered if my son wanted the pictures. The housing
was very plain, there were sixteen apartments in one building, there would be a
little porch here and a little porch there, and a little porch there. In each
porch, there’s a stairway to going up to the upstairs apartments and the two
front doors to the two bottom ones, and that was it. There was no doorbell,
there was no porch light. It was just a porch, probably two or four feet wide
and that was it and steps down to the next. The lawn was just what was there, it
wasn’t improved on, it was what was there. We paid thirty-five a month, and
that included everything, I mean electricity, no water bill, you paid your own
phone bill. There were no refrigerators; it was icebox, so there was an iceman
that came around with ice. There was a little stove, a little four-burner stove,
and an oven below. One bath that had a built in tile tub; it wasn’t a bath
tub, it was a tile built-in tub with little tiles this big all sides and the
bottom and that was it. I suppose they couldn’t get the plumping pieces that
they want. In the little kitchen, it was a counter with a sink in the middle
with just two faucets and the place for your food things there were no doors on
it -- it was just shelves. In the living room was a wall table that pull down
out of the wall with a leg on it, and there were shelves back of that table.
There was one davenport that opened up to sleep for two people so that was it.
There was one bedroom, one window in it, one little closet probably two feet
wide and that was it. I tell you, everybody was so glad to get the shelter, that
was accepted. I don’t remember being feeling bad about living there. We were
able to save up enough money to buy that lot and put up a duplex on it and right
away we bought that lot across the street and put a duplex on it. I was staying
home then because of the kids’ age. I tell you, I pounded the dickens out of
nails and painted everything right along with my husband. We got a contractor to
start it, but we had the agreement that we could build everything, so many
things ourselves. I know I it was a flattop and I had beautiful pine board
ceilings in it, and I got up on top of that thing and pounded nails that long
into the beam. The people across the street saw told my husband, “Just let her
alone, she can build.” I never done that before -- carpenter work, so it was
fascinating to me. Had a nice garden and we even had few chickens. We’re very
well taken care of and we lived there four years.

STINE: You said that had been an empty lot, had there been war housing on it
that had been razed?

STEWART: No. It was a garage on it. We had to take down the garage and clear the
ground for the duplex. And it was a two bedroom duplex on either side, so it was
a big building in a way with two garages in the middle. It took up fair amount
material, yard work. But then we kept saving and saving, that was our way of
life -- managing very well. Then we bought another lot up on South 3rd and 14th
and put a three-bedroom house on it. We bought another lot down near the
hospital on South 14th in the same block ours was in and put a house on that.

STINE: Did you continue to do the work yourselves?

STEWART: Oh, yes. Then we bought two lots on South 7th Street and put a house on
each of those -- three bedroom homes. We also bought a house, 22nd and Ohio, a
lot and cleared it and put another house on that, and we rented them for
twenty-seven years.

STINE: So had any of these lots had pre-existing -- ?

STEWART: No, they couldn’t build on a twenty-five foot lot. See? They
couldn’t put housing on -- they were too narrow.

STINE: And it wasn’t until after the war that you were given clearance?

STEWART: Yes. That was what we look for -- a twenty-five foot lot and put a
longer house on it with a garage. There are still standing there living in them today.

STINE: That must be neat for you.

STEWART: Yes, once a while I drive by, you know just to look at it. There’s a
Mexican family in the house we built and lived in first, and he has a big family
so he has his whole family in both units. I think he’s got a garage door
between the garage walls so there’s good communication between them all, you
know. His mother-in-law, then everybody, the other families living in there. Now
he’s walled up the yard, I don’t know how he got by with that -- big high
fencing around the lot. I don’t think you are suppose to have lot on the
street more than four foot. Maybe nobody’s complained down there. But he was a
nice man, I’ve stopped and talked to him and told him my husband and I had
built that, was he happy with it. Yeah, so that was good.

STINE: I’m kinda curious when you first move to Richmond had that first house
and you saw that other lot if that was a plan that you had had with your husband
all along or did it just kind of came up. How did that come up?

STEWART: No. It was his idea of something to get ahead that he could learn
anything; he wasn’t a one-character person that just could do only one thing.
But he was very good at plumbing, electricity, so when there are maintenance of
those places, he could take care of anything. We had people stayed us fifteen,
seventeen years, you know, because we were good to them and that worked out
good. But he could do any plumbing problems or carpenter work.

STINE: So this was all stuff that he picked up and -- ?

STEWART: It was a very good investment, but that was his ingenuity. He was
looking for a way to make some money on his own or on our own and do well with
it, and we did. So that was it.

STINE: Right after the war, what had he been doing for employment up until -- ?

STEWART: Oh. He worked Albert’s Mill a long time down in Oakland. It was on
7th Street where at one time you could down the foot of 7th Street and take the
ferry from Oakland over to the city, so it was on a main thoroughfare that went
through there down Albert’s Mill. It was an old establishment there, corn
mill, you know, and he worked there a long time. Then when we got going with
houses and things, he would just take maybe a year’s job or something, because
we had enough to do with keeping the places. But he was a sharp individual about
handling everything whatever it was -- money, property, never threw away a
thing, so he always had everything. [laughter] That was good, because I admired
him for his ingenuity. He also had an eye for everything. Coming home from 7th
Street from work, you came through the old Oakland Army Base where the people
lived, the housing was on both sides, when he noticed they had a lot of stone
work all piled up and it was beautiful granite, chunks. So he stopped and asked,
“What you gonna do with that?” They were gonna re-style the yards in the
front -- they wanted to get rid of that stone stuff, so they said, “Take them
home if you want to, take it.” So every night, he stopped and he had a station
wagon, he put fifteen of those chunks granite in and bring it home. And that’s
the granite around our front and the back yards. Yeah, and it all came from
Maine as a ballast on a boat, and they used that for trim and the housing there
and they were gonna throw it away. They had no idea what they had -- hand-hewn granite.

STINE: It sounds like he had a real eye for --

STEWART: Yes, he did. We could live on a lot less than a lot of people, because
the way we both lived. When you don’t throw anything away and you can use what
you make what you need. I sewed like everything, even when the boys when to
school, I made ten shirts right off the bat for them. They had to have white
shirts, ten shirts for them right away.

STINE: Button up shirts?

STEWART: Collars, sleeves to here and a pocket, more buttons down the front.
Everybody did that; a lot of people did especially my family that was the way we
grew up.

STINE: During the war, did you ever sew your own clothes or sew -- ?

STEWART: Yes, I did make dresses and quilts. I’ve got a quilt on the bed now
that I made and another in the dresser drawer. That was good home entertainment
-- quilting and crocheting, and you name it, women did it. You didn’t go out
to play cards or bridge club like they do now. You made your time pay for
something and that was good because as it is now, I don’t have to have
entertainment or be running here or running there, it was the way of life that
I’ve continued and continue now. My family and my generation really -- that
was our style. You need something, okay, You can make it, do that, but if not,
you buy it. Never charge a thing, everything was cash on the line. I still
don’t have a credit card; I wouldn’t have one for anything. You can go
without, it doesn’t hurt you. People don’t do that today, but I do. [laughter]

STINE: I’m curious about the transition then, just to jump back a little bit,
the transition at the end of the war. Maybe we’ll start kind of specifically
when you heard, you know that Japan had surrendered and what you remember about
that day? Maybe talk a little bit about the transition working.

STEWART: Course, it was mostly, I don’t think there’s TV then, no, there
wasn’t when Japan surrendered, everybody listened to the radio and the
newspapers had picture of the people signing, surrendering on the boat. Oh, my,
it was a change of atmosphere and attitudes -- what am I gonna do now? But a lot
of the people that came for the war effort, they had established themselves as
citizens here, a lot of them did, they didn’t return to Oklahoma or the
Midwest and their families’ are still here. But that was a big, “oh my, what
was going happen to us,” a lot of suspension, a lot of, “Was everything
gonna be alright or what were we gonna be faced with?” Roosevelt, he was on
his third or fourth term there, and it was wobbly and who ever heard of a
president, four terms you know, and then he dies. But Truman came in, and Truman
was a godsend, because he was a no nonsense person and he stuck by his ways. He
gave people confidence, because he wasn’t a silly thing would try this or
that. It worked because he had it all thought out. At the end, when the
shipyards were closing, people showed a lot of tension and apprehension and
“What’s gonna happen to us?” That was a lot of the conversation if you met
them on the street or where, it was that same feeling -- “What’s gonna
happen now? What’s around the corner for us?”

STINE: How about the health plan?

STEWART: They were just started the health plan then and you could enroll -- 50
cents a week I think. That was a godsend to the medical care for people. You
didn’t have to work in the shipyards; you could enroll and be covered
medically. That hospital on, Kaiser had it on South 14th and Cutting, it grew
and swelled, and business right and left. It was a busy, busy place and they
added more to the building by quite a bit. I remember seeing an iron lung in the
hallway, they never used it, but they had it in case patient came in and needed
it. They had deliveries there, delivery rooms for babies to be born there. And a
little bit of surgery, not much, but little surgery. But the medical department
grew big.

STINE: But was there maybe a little bit of a dip in between the end of the war
and -- ?

STEWART: Oh yes! Kaiser had a good theme about -- gung-ho and we’re gonna be
able to swing a good deal here. Because the population was here for membership
and the doctors weren’t going to war now, so they could hire reliable staff.
Now, in the wartime, a lot of those doctors especially in the shipyards --
retired doctors that came back. The one we had in Yard One was seventy-five or
so then, but came back for the war effort. So Kaiser hired about a dozen young
doctors that had come back and were just finishing school and had have a place
to put them to work. So, they spent their first week in the shipyards until they
got Kaiser Oakland going. You see they bought Kaiser Oakland, that old Fabiola,
but it was just an end building and right a way they expanded and gave those
doctors offices. I remember the ear, nose and throat doctor was a young Jewish
doctor, very good, maybe thirty-five, but right a way, he got his department in
Oakland and he stayed with that for years and expanded. So, that was the way the
general population of medical help went.

STINE: Where did they put these doctors in the shipyards for the interim?

STEWART: There was just one medical unit in each yard.

STINE: Right, but the dozen of young doctors.

STEWART: They just stay in there; they were there two weeks or three weeks until
they could get stationed in Oakland. They didn’t stay long. Most of them were
out of medical school, young, and they were eager to get going -- make a living.
That’s what they trained for, let’s go get a job, go. They weren’t old
enough to start medical practice on their own and they didn’t have the money
then so they would get hired on something or in a group like Kaiser. A lot of
them, I think at Providence, that was a school of nursing starting and it’s
Summit now but it used to be something else. It used to be; it had another name.

STINE: It sounds interesting though, because it sounds like there’s a dynamic
of these much older kind of veteran doctors and then these batch of very, very
young, is that the same with the nurses. So then you have this mentoring
relationship going assuming --

STEWART: Well, the old doctors quit right away when the young ones came. They
sure did.

STINE: So there wasn’t really a chance to overlap and kind of show them --

STEWART: As long as Kaiser Oakland started growing, oh, big departments. They
had to get a school of nursing, director of nurses. When I was there, there
wasn’t any director of nurses; we kept our own time card and all that. So it
just like that, it was amazing all the things that -- . Had to get an ambulance,
for patients. It was amazing what you saw grow all right. It all worked. Doctor
Cutting was a marvelous planner, and his wife Millie Cutting worked right with
him and she was a sensible -- . Any place needed anything you call Millie and
she would get it for you, material wise, you know that you needed, maybe
microscopes or something, slides or get a better delivery of bandages or
anything that you needed. There was no problem; you get call Millie and it was there.

STINE: She was also in charge of hiring, is that correct?

STEWART: Well, she looked over my resume and said, “Can you go to work this
afternoon.” There was somebody there, but if she was there, and you walked in
and this was it, she would talk to you and tell you and that was it. But it grew
very fast even the office part before Kaiser Oakland really got to function. It
was up at the top of that hill, no; Alta Bates was in Berkeley. But anyway,
Millie Cutting and Doctor Cutting, he’s still alive, he looks just like he did
when you came in the shipyard, very knowledgeable man -- he was smart as a whip.
He and Doctor Garfield put the place in good order and there was no shady talk
about anything. They were always recommended and got praised for their work.

STINE: Did they ever come to the first aid stations or didn’t?

STEWART: Oh, yes. They came to see how things were going and what did we find
was a problem or need or something. If it was logical, it was taken care of.

STINE: How often do you think they came?

STEWART: Maybe once a month or then unexpected or maybe in two weeks they’d be
there, then you wouldn’t see them for a month. Garfield, we didn’t see quite
as much as we did Mrs. Cutting and Dr. Cutting. Garfield was a little over
Cutting in the stature of rank and it wasn’t long there were more hospitals
started Kaiser and he was very much in charge to see that was started right, and
did very well with that. No, those two men were very, very good planners and
deserve a lot of credit for what Kaiser is today.

STINE: I just want to make sure that we have this record exactly how the kind of
chain of referral happened, because I know you had mention when somebody had an
injury at the first aid station if it was something that was much larger a
problem than you could deal with there, you would then refer them at first to
the is it the Richmond Field Hospital?

STEWART: No, before Richmond Hospital was functioning, we sent them to Richmond
Hospital on 23rd Street, that was a hospital that was functioning surgery and
medical. And I think there was pediatrics ward there.

STINE: But would you say it was kind of, not bare bones but just the essentials?

STEWART: Yes, it was nice little hospital, but it didn’t have to be great, I
mean we didn’t have to be big, because the population didn’t ask for big
hospital then. And it didn’t grow, the building is still the same size that it
was when it started; they did a lot of work there. Then when Kaiser Oakland got
so they could take care of the patients, the ambulance took them when they were
broken legs and things like that, crushed in any way, the extremities, they were
taken to Kaiser Oakland. They were taken to that entrances on Broadway, that’s
kind of a discharge place now, that was a big entrance in there.

STINE: [laughter] Opposite now. This just make me think real quick of a question
-- I was wondering if any of the injuries, did you ever see any maybe stress
related job injuries or maybe people were so tired from double shifts or do you
think that was -- ?

STEWART: People didn’t complain then. They came to work, Amen! You didn’t
see anybody shirking on the job. Man or woman, when the women came, you just
didn’t see that. Now, we had a room for just eye work, I think four or five
gurneys in a row for the people who got flash burns, the welders who got foreign
bodies in their eyes. If they were sent home because of a very bad flash burn to
bandage both eyes, we had to call a wife to come to the front of the ambulance,
the van would take them to the gate. Then we want to see them the next day, they
could come back and get checked and that’s was about as much follow up work as
we did. When people had to stay home for a reason, a broken arm or something,
then they were to see either Kaiser Oakland follow up or that was it.

STINE: I guess I didn’t mean so much necessarily complaining about stress, but
in your opinion did you ever seen people maybe talked about had injuries because
they weren’t as familiar with the job they were doing. But did you think
people were ever maybe over worked or over -- ?

STEWART: No. You never heard a complaint about had to come to work today or
something like that. That was never uttered. People felt so grateful for a job
and they could help the war effort especially if they had maybe two sons in the
service and then for the dad to complain? No, that wouldn’t go over. So they
felt like they were pretty lucky that they weren’t called. No, you didn’t
hear that or see that among men or women. People initially had more pride and
everything. If they got a job, they were happy, they wanted to keep it. Lots of
it, the reason was because they could afford a home if they had a job. Living
conditions before the war were pretty tough, a lot of people didn’t have any
money and they moved in with families and you know. They didn’t have fancy
stores or fancy food, you were lucky to have a roof over your head, Amen and
don’t complain or you get -- . [laughter] It’s different today; people want
everything on a platter handed to them. It’s maybe an extreme from years ago,
but that’s human nature. There’s always gonna be a digger and there’s
always gonna be a lazy person I don’t care where you are now -- an ambitious
person or a lazy. You see it in schools now, you see it in families, you see it
in the kids. It’s not a healthy thing, there are a lot of things aren’t as
healthy as we grew up with. Everybody expected to earn their way in this life,
and that was typical of 1942.

STINE: At the same time that people were saving all these money and earning more
money than they had hoped before the war, did people have an opportunity to go
out maybe get something special?

STEWART: The theme then was save for a house.

STINE: Is that something that you would overhear like at lunch or over here --

STEWART: No, you didn’t go out for lunch or to a movie in the afternoon. [laughter]

STINE: Right, right, right. I just meant, you know, at the shipyards when people
are just out and about. [laughter]

STEWART: There was more of a regulated life in a way, yeah. If you did that,
like a drunk always shows up somewhere you know. But people had no time for
that. If they were drunk, get out of my way. Obnoxious. Me coming from Berkeley
to the shipyard, I was so grateful I had a ride with the man across from the
street eventually. If you think I complained about anything, no way. Even I had
to wait for ten minutes or half an hour for him to get off the job but I was
there waiting for him, that was the way the day went. No, people didn’t
complain as readily as they do now.

STINE: Maybe if I could just ask a couple more questions about what your husband
did and the shipyards, he was a safety inspector.

STEWART: Safety inspector in Yard One. It was round the clock, twenty-four hours
they had a day shift, a swing shift and a graveyard. At first, he was on swing
shift, then he edged up to the three star, he was a boss on ship.

STINE: He was a boss?

STEWART: Yeah, on the swing shift. He was a dependable person that’s why he
got ahead. Because he was not a big mouth, or I’ll show you or anything like
that. When he learn something, he learned to improve himself too or grow with
whatever was around him. The accidents in the shipyard happened right and left,
injury accidents. The safety office was like an insurance firm that analyzed
every accident, how could they have prevented it and what will we do to prevent
it again from happening, safety features of all sorts. It’s like the welders,
they had to have helmets and outfits to wear, and those glasses or goggle things
for welding and that was absolute. People didn’t take a chance and try to do
something foolishly; they didn’t. But every accident had to be analyzed on
paper and handed in. That was a way for the office function was the head boss,
there was a man on day shift, and a man below him. My husband on the swing
shift, the man below him and a man on graveyard. They went right to the scene of
the accident to see how it happened themselves, and what happened, and if any
help needed to be called in any shape or form, that was their job to see that it
was taking care of. Anything broken out of the business, I mean the machines or
anything see that it wasn’t used until it was okay, all that kind of stuff.
First time, he never done anything like that. But after all, he was 4F and he
had to get a job in the shipyard, so that was why he was there. But he was also
a person that had his eyes open to everything and learned as he went along and
applied to his benefit, you know, to grow. He wanted his family to have the best
of everything, have trips and all of that. So that was good. He was a very good
provider and lived to be seventy-eight, I think, so that was good. Yeah.

STINE: I’m just gonna switch the tapes really quick. [interview interruption]

STEWART: You learned to do it and you did it without complaining.

STINE: Are there any places you remember in Richmond where you used to shop or
were you used to go out.

STEWART: No. Downtown Richmond on 10th Street, that was the center of town.
There was a Macy&#039;s store, I think 8th Street was a [J.C.] Penny store -- a nice
one. There was a Mechanics Bank that functioned there. Oh, it’s beautiful
inside if you ever -- marble floors and marble desks or tables in there,
gorgeous marble things, beautiful inside. That was good. There was a hardware
store, there was a few dress clothing for women, very few beauty shops then,
there were some saving and loan places.

STINE: Wonder why that the beauty shops -- ?

STEWART: People didn’t go to the shops then so much as they do now. No, people
didn’t patronize, you got a permanent that -- a lot of was done on your own,
your own permanent. Of course, there weren’t any women barbers then, and if
you went to a barber, you’d be a man in a men store, a men shop. It wasn’t
anything that would attract women, but everything was a business and that was
it. They function and it was a big [Travelini] furniture store up a few blocks
and it just function like a small town should.

STINE: Do you have any idea if any of those stores are still here today?

STEWART: Macy’s gone, Penny’s is gone, the bank’s closed, the [Travelini]
is closed. No, everything’s closed that was there then -- closed or something
else in it. You weren’t afraid to go downtown by yourself even -- . Of course,
I didn’t go down alone, because I had kids with me. When they outgrew the
buggy, it was this long. I got a coaster wagon and put one in one end. But that
was when you said, “No”, that was “No” and they behaved. You can pull
the wagon behind you; they behaved in there. They didn’t fall out and get hurt
or anything; they expected. Cars did not have seat belts and if you were the
driver, you sat a child in the other seat in the front, you didn’t worry about
him falling out, because he knew he had to sit there. The same in church, kids
didn’t carrying on or run in church, no. Behavior was all together different.
Then I got acquainted with the nuns, and the nuns were cloistered and they could
not go out for anything other than a medical appointment. So, I did the grocery
shopping for many years for them. Call up Thursday night and get their grocery
list and go and get it and take it to them. That was fine. Then I got to know
the priest and so I did the church laundry for long -- twenty years I did that.
Then they started to program at the church for people who wanted to learn about
the faith and become a Catholic, so I did that for ten years every Wednesday
night. When I got crippled in my left knee, I had to give it all up. Of course
the nuns disappeared; they had lay teachers so there wasn’t the grocery need
for them.

STINE: I’m sure the church miss you.

STEWART: [laughter] The priest and I -- [tape cuts out] Christmas time now, the
neighbors up there, we all keep track of one another. So, that’s nice. But I
have been very fortunate in my life that I was able to help others in a way that
I could. And be a good person and appreciate life. I don’t know when my time
is coming to be leaving this earth, but I can say I’ve been very lucky.

STINE: Lucky and you’ve done so much and touch so many people.

STEWART: Yeah. I never ask for anything if I could do it myself, and I still
don’t. So that’s just the way -- . I’m going have to have some help now
before long with housekeeping or something like that and I never had that so
it’s gotta to find someone that’s reliable and honest. It’s a job; but
I’ll have to do that eventually. I can’t get down to my knees anymore, walk
out of the road or anything. [laughter]

STINE: No one expects me to.

STEWART: I can mow the backyard.

STINE: Harriet, this has been delightful interview.

STEWART: Has it been?

STINE: Yeah, it really has.

STEWART: Well, that’s good.

STINE: I think that you’ve really given so much of the whole process, I just
wonder if there’s anything you feel like I’ve neglected or there’s
anything that you would want to add about anything throughout the spectrum of
your life that specifically more about your war time experience or about your
time in Richmond.

STEWART: I had no idea that my life would turn out like it has and the turn of
events that happened, you know like the war, I would never have come to
California if it hadn’t been the war -- December, 7th. I was doing private
duty nursing there, and that paid twice as much as a hospital nurse, but I never
would have been even to save your money there at that time, you couldn’t make
and save a lot like you could out here. So, I’ve been very grateful that I was
able to come and do that in a good way and keep my health and able to do it,
then I was fortunate to have such a wonderful husband and my children. Three
children -- they were just marvelous. The kids were very good kids and to this
day, I’m proud of them so I have lots of rewards. And I don’t think
everybody can say that. I’m very, very well taken care of by their concern and
everything and that’s good. Even though, they are miles away. Thank you for
coming here -- even being interested in this sort of life.

STINE: We are all interested.

STEWART: If you see or talk to that Steve, tell him to call me if there’s --
[tape cuts out] Too bad they don’t have that today.

STINE: At the end of the war, I asked you a little bit about, you know, how
things change and transition. How did things change for you personally when you
knew the shipyards were closing? Did Kaiser offer you a job outside the shipyard?

STEWART: I was married then, and it was gonna be the end of the days I’m going
to work in the shipyard. For my husband too, because the yard closing. He worked
few months longer than I did, because the first aid unit was closed in Yard One.

STINE: Was it the first one to close or -- ?

STEWART: No. They all closed about the same time except one, Yard Three, because
that shipyard was gonna function longer. But Yard Two and us and Yard Four and
the Prefab area, that all closed down all together. So, you knew ahead of time
that was gonna be your last days on the job, because the men weren’t coming
either, in mobs to go to work. It was just close the shipyard. They kept the
safety people on for a while though kinda watch things about preventing any
accidents or anything like that. We knew there be the end of it. Kaiser didn’t
offer any of us nurses any jobs in Oakland, but if I wanted to work, I could
have. But gee, I’m married now, I was just gonna enjoy a little bit. I lived
right there on the campus and I went up to work at that UC hospital on the
campus that they had the students in, and I was up there three months and Ms.
Waylon called me and asked me to come to work. So, I took that job.

STINE: So, clearly she had heard of your job?

STEWART: Yeah, they took some names of people. That happened to maybe a handful
of nurses that I knew or was acquainted with. But there were more than that,
because they could get nurses for -- we didn’t know the nurses in Yard Two or
Yard Three, because you just went to work in your yard, amen. So when she called
me, I said, “Well, yeah. It might be interesting,” so I went to work in the
delivery room. That was on the top floor of that big unit on the corner of
Broadway and MacArthur. We had six women and six babies [laughter]. We had one
LVN -- she wasn’t even a LVN, just an aide took care of the babies and took
them down to the mothers and that -- . There was only like the boss and me,
because you didn’t have -- the patients weren’t there at first, but that
grew like that because of the enrollment in the Kaiser plan. It was closed in
the shipyard, but people wanted that medical coverage so they paid their Kaiser
dues if the company didn’t pay for it. That means going to work at Macy’s.
Macy didn’t pay Kaiser health care, so you had to pay your own. But the
coverage -- the number of people grew. Oh, it just grew. That’s why Kaiser
Oakland expanded. Oh, just no end to what was gonna be next. Yeah, I enjoyed the
time when we first went there, we didn’t even have a doctor in charge of OB.
But they hired one, Robert King, and he was a dandy person. I mean knowledgeable
but such a nice person, and he was there with Kaiser for twenty or twenty-five
years, but we were up there and we call an intern if we had a delivery come in.
An intern that was on call. [Tape cuts out] What should I do about my heart? It
was only because of an injury on the job just then, no matter what the injury
was if they can walk and they came in there, fine. If they had an injury that
you’d have to send an ambulance for, we had that van and a first aid man that
drive out to it and pick them up. The care was really very good, the medical
care for what happened there, the injuries. In each yard, we had a x-ray
machine, and I learned to take x-rays and develop the film and all, didn’t
know beans about it but I learned from the first aid man. Imagine taking foreign
bodies out of eyes, now it’s a doctor’s job.

STINE: Straight out of nurses training. [laughter]

STEWART: That what you did. The one doctor had a busy job, but he wasn’t over
worked to the point where he was over worked. It was a working job all right. We
had very little slack time; we always did sit down for lunch. Because the whole
shipyard sat down; all men quit work for half an hour.

STINE: All the same time? Was there some kind of a bell or some kind of -- ?

STEWART: Oh, a big whistle. Whistle for the shipyard to tell them it was twelve
o’clock and then another whistle half past if that was the time that get on
the job again. That was big whistle that sounded, couldn’t miss it that big.
That was when if there was any entertainment brought to the shipyard, like Henry
Kaiser did. That was always during the noon hour. Amen! They didn’t come at
ten o’clock or two thirty and distract anybody.

STINE: It was an act of business.

STEWART: Yeah. It was when you were eating your lunch. There were no lunchrooms.
If you were out on a job, and you had time to eat, you sat down on the floor.

STINE: Just where you were?

STEWART: Wherever you were, yeah. Ate your lunch, waited for the whistle to
blown get back. That was the way with everything. It was a no nonsense day. You
didn’t last if you were a fooler or a -- , you get fired. Very few people ask
to be fired or carry gun like that, because either they had a relative in the
service or son or daughter or husband so they couldn’t pull that stuff. It was
what I expected, I never do anything except you give all of yourself and your
job, you don’t go there and sit down or sit in the back room. That just
didn’t work. I think somebody came in and swept the place at night, but that
was it as far as cleaning the place. You cleaned up after yourself, everything.
When the tables were used for the eye work, you changed the paper on whole
thing, and that was it. You did it yourself, you didn’t ask for a maid to
come. Even if you spill blood or something on the floor, you cleaned it up
yourself. There was no maid service or janitor. Course, outside in the shipyard,
there was no nonsense. I mean if you did something, drop the board and left it
there that was a no-no for sure. Because if anybody got hurt or car hit the
board or something, that’d be the end of you. No, you cleaned up after
yourself and in every way. [Tape cuts out] Gosh, we had an oxygen tank on
wheels. I gave oxygen to the mothers until we got an anesthesiologist up there
if that’s what we needed. We didn’t have anything like that. [laughter] The
amount of deliveries just grew, really fantastic. It was thirty a month, in
nothing flat. Then it just kept growing -- the number deliveries a month.

STINE: How long had you been working there when it really started to pick up?

STEWART: Oh, the next week or so. It started expanding. I think when I left
there in nine months, it was about thirty -- that’ll be one a day. So, we were
busy delivering babies and putting everything together for the next delivery to
begin sterilize so we have it all handy for the any mother that came in any
time. It was nice, because we grew in a nice easy way. We are not demanding or
we deserve this or anything like that. It was we wanted to do the best we could,
and we did. No matter who you were, whether it was the boss or another nurse or
what, you just didn’t get by with shady work then. Everybody was well equipped
to do the job and it was amazing. Because I know that when the boys were born,
that was in ‘46. Every mother stayed a week in the hospital after delivery
automatic. They had to expand the department so pediatric was right below up,
but they moved pediatric down to the second floor and gave us the third floor
for the mothers. It was big job, I mean a full time job. You didn’t go up
there and sit neither did you sit anywhere though, because the pediatrics was
busy, and medical was busy, and everything was very efficient. Ms. Waylon did a
wonderful job; she was very good. She had good help; she worked days but the
evening shift was in graveyard was run just as well as day shift. The doctors
were good. The young doctors that they hired had maybe graduated from graduate
school, didn’t know anything about OB or so. They got trained and I guess you
call it. [laughter] If they were interested in OB, that was great for them.
Because if you can learn right with your nose right in the business, it’s
better than reading it out of a book what to do. Kaiser really functioned very
well in so many ways no wonder it went over so great.

STINE: How about your husband -- how did he make that transition you said he got
to work a couple of months longer?

STEWART: He’s fine. He got a job at Albert’s Mill in Oakland.

STINE: Was that right away or -- ?

STEWART: Yeah. It was a day shift, full time job. He was bossing up and flat. He
was there eight years, I think, and he decided we wanted to do that building.
So, we did that. He would take a job just anywhere in Oakland, anywhere that
needed a man for six or eight months or something. So, he did that and he worked
in many little places in Berkeley and that for a year or so. That was just with
the knowledge that he’d be there as long as the job would last. Because
building, as much as we did in the structure of each place, took a lot of time.
Not only getting the roof down and the electric place done right. It took time
and a lot of work to get -- [tape cuts out] Have been such friends, I mean such
good friends and clean and nothing shady. Nothing. I’m like with them even
today, “When I see a red onion, I think of you,” that’s kind of an
atmosphere we have with one another. Just nicest feeling that I have such good
friends as priest. I have one priest that came and was so kind to my husband
when he couldn’t go to church, and he come and play cards with him, and
playing with us and have dinner here, and he comes to dinner here every Monday
night to this day for seventeen years I’ve known him. He has a young friend
that brings him and the two of them sit here we play cards and poke fun of one
another. What you got for dessert? Then they leave about eight o’clock and go
take him back. He’s retired, so he lives in Oakland at a retired priest home.
But he calls me everyday to see if I’m all right. That’s just nice. But the
priests I’ve known have been nothing like you read about in some of men
getting into trouble today. No. I’ve been very grateful for that because I
never hear a dirty story or a dirty word or a hint about something shady that
isn’t the way they -- . So, I’ve been very fortunate with the priests and
the nuns their familiarity. I was in high school in the convent, so I knew about
nuns and about their social life is not outside. So, I was well acquainted.
I’m happy to do their grocery shopping for them. And that was good. They paid
me; I wasn’t providing them. It was case of they needed outside help and if I
could do it, I did. And I didn’t expect anything in return and that was it. So
that worked out fine.

STINE: It sounds like you are really very active. It seems according to this.

STEWART: Yeah. When I don’t go to school, I go to mass every morning up there
at eight o’clock. There’s a few of us old timers that show up every morning,
so we greet one another. I’m glad to see one another still able to do it. So
that’s nice. Christian religion has been a great help to me; it’s taught me
many things about being honorable and respect other people that I see a lot of
people don’t have. I have faults too, I’m human, but I know when you grow up
you don’t steal and those kind of things, you know, makes a better person of
you. But I have very good parents, excellent parents, kind of like pioneers in a
way, but they were good parents. They didn’t give us money, my parents had
money, but you didn’t get handout every week. If you needed something, you got
it that was no problem. But they took us on trips rather than --

STINE: That sounds like what you and your husband provided for your children, too.

STEWART: We did. We went on a lot of trips. In 1968, my husband and Martha, our
daughter and I, we went around the world and that was a marvelous trip.

STINE: That sounds amazing.

STEWART: Yeah. Then we came back, and the next year we bought four acres up
there and put a house on it. So, that was a nice thing to do and I enjoyed for
thirty-two years, it was. I just sold it two or three years ago and I miss it terribly.

STINE: Oh, I’m sure.

STEWART: But it comes to time when you have to do things like that. It was too
much work for me and I’m not able to do all that work anymore.
