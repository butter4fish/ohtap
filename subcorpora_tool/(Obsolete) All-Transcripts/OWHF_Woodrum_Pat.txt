Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  Nykolaiszyn  My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Tuesday, July 22, 2008, and I am in Tulsa, Oklahoma  interviewing Pat Woodrum. This interview is being conducted as part of  the Inductees of the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame Oral History  Project. Pat was inducted into the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame in  1993. Thank you for joining us today.  Thank you for inviting me to be here.  Well, let   s begin by learning a little bit more about you. Could you give  us some background on where you grew up and your early life?  I grew up in Kansas. When I was 12, my family moved from  Hutchinson to Parsons, Kansas, and I lived there until I left for college.  I   m the eldest of four children, and I just lived in a small town and began  working in the Parsons Public Library when I was 15 years old.  What motivated you to get that first library job?  I   ve always loved libraries. I can remember when I was four years     yeah, you can remember things like that, when you   re that young. My  father took me to the Hutchinson Public Library, and I can remember  that first trip. From there on, I was sold. I spent my summers in  Hutchinson when I was younger, riding my bicycle to the library about  three times a week and checking out books, and going home and going  to a very cool basement and spending my summer afternoons reading. I  remember one summer I decided that I was going to start with the A   s  and work around the children   s room and see if I could read the whole  collection. Of course, I couldn   t, but that was my goal. So I   ve always  loved libraries.  Well, tell me a little bit about the types of schools you went to growing  up. Were they large schools, small schools; your favorite subject?  5  Woodrum  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  In elementary school, they were all small schools. And then when I  went to high school, I chose to go to a community college   in Altamont,  Kansas, which was about ten miles from Parsons. The reason I did that  was it was it was a school that taught you skills rather than preparing  you for college. My goal was college all along, but I knew because of  my family   s circumstances and being the eldest of four, that I would  probably be putting myself through college. So I went to this particular  high school in order to get secretarial skills, business skills that would  help me later on.  And they did, they certainly did. My favorite subjects   cooking,  because they taught things like that back then, and I   ve always loved  cooking. And then later on, I went a year and a half to the Parsons  Junior College and got an associate   s degree and then went on to what  was Pittsburg State Teacher   s College then in Kansas. While I was in  college, I would say without a doubt that literature and English were my  favorite subjects.  Going into college, did you know what you were going to major in?  I was pretty sure, because as I said earlier, I had decided that I wanted to  work in the public library when I was 15. I worked there every summer  while I was going to school, and then I worked after school, too. I loved  being there; I loved opening the boxes of new books. One of my first  mentors was the Parsons public librarian. It was a small staff of three  people, but I thought she was so worldly, because she   d lived in New  York City. She really helped me along the way and helped form the  ideas of how great it would be to make this a career.  Now, after you received your degree, what did you do from there?  Well, along the way, I got married while I was in college. I met my  husband when I was 14, and, six years later, we got married while we  were both going to school. We were both putting ourselves through  college, and he was working two jobs and I was working two jobs. I  knew that if I really wanted to go into the library field that I needed to  have the graduate degree. And so again, there was never any doubt, and  my husband always encouraged me   and from Pittsburg, I went to the  University of Oklahoma and got my master   s in library science.  Is that what brought you to Oklahoma?  We were both footloose and fancy free at that time, and he had a degree  in accounting. We could have gone anywhere   anywhere in the  country, but at that time, the Tulsa City-County Library system had just  been created two years   one year   prior to my decision to come here. I  6  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  had heard about the director who became my second mentor, Allie Beth  Martin, and all the great things that were being done. We decided this is  the place that we wanted to come and make our home   and start my  library career. So I left OU in May and three days later began working  at the Tulsa City-County Library system as a branch librarian.  What was that experience like for you? Now you   re working as the  librarian in your own library.  Oh. It was exhilarating. It was wonderful, and it was a building   a  library that was brand new. It was under construction when I came to  Tulsa in June, and it was in a strip shopping center in south Tulsa   the  Woodland View Library. There were three staff members   two others  on the staff and myself, and it was great.  Now, you held many different roles before becoming executive director?  I worked in almost every area of the city-county library system   was  head of reference and head of bookmobiles and branch libraries, and I  had a lot of really good experience, which was extremely helpful to me.  How did you go about, when the position became open   were you  encouraged to apply?  It was really a sad time, because Allie Beth Martin had been the director  for 13 years. She was named director when the system was created.  She   d been on the staff, and she was diagnosed with cancer in November  of one year, if I remember right   September or November   and she  passed away in April. All of us were very   everybody in system was  just devastated. I was the assistant director at that time, and the board     the library commission   decided to do a nationwide search. I applied,  and I was hired for that position, which was one of the highlights of my  life, to be named the director of the Tulsa City-County Library System.  Now starting off, what were some of your challenges you faced going  into that position? What were some of the challenges, the branches     you could foresee?  Well, money is always a problem with public libraries, as you know   or  it is off and on. And one of the things that I knew was going to be a  challenge was to stabilize the permanent funding for the system. The  library system is supported by ad valorem taxes, but they had reached a  time where there   s a state cap. I knew that it was going to be necessary,  as did other public library directors, to go back to the legislature and to  raise that cap statewide so that the eight library systems in the state  would be able to go back to their voters and increase the amount that  7  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  they had in order to support the libraries. So I guess that was one, but I  just had a terrific board. They were very, very supportive, and I knew  them all well, because I had worked with them for 13 years. So it was  just fun. It was fun, and a great group of people. I couldn   t have asked  for anything more.  Well, tell me about some of your successes   32 years is a long time.  One of the things that I was pleased with was an endowment had been  set up a few years before I was named director but had never really been  developed. At the time that I was named director, there was  10,000 in  it. I felt that that was another way to secure permanent funding, to get in  there and begin to develop the endowment. So I encouraged one of the  staff members to work with me. And a member of the library  commission, Peggy V. Helmerich, said that she would join us. The three  of us set forth in raising funds for the endowment. Now, sounds real  easy, but we set out. We had a plan. We had a lot of really good advice  from people in the community, and we did raise the money for the  endowment   lost track of what it was when I left, but around  11  million, I believe, with its own board.  And at that time, Tulsa was the only public library in the country   tax  supported public library   that had an endowment. Many communities  didn   t feel that they ought to give   seems ridiculous to me   to a tax  supported institution, and, so, when this idea took off in Tulsa, then lots  of other communities   lots of other libraries   wanted to know, how do  you go about doing this? I did a lot of seminars across the country and  met with a lot of library boards, and now there are lots of public libraries  that have endowments. It   s helped a lot.  I also was reading something about the homeless.  Yes. That was an interesting process. You know, you start out doing  things, and you don   t know where they   re going to go? And that  certainly was the situation with the homeless in Tulsa. I think it was in  the early 1980s, maybe 1982   I don   t know   when a lot of different  things happened in Tulsa to bring a lot of people to Tulsa and to cause a  lot of the people to be on the streets. It was at that time that Oral  Roberts had just completed the City of Faith and was inviting people  through his television program to come to Tulsa for medical care. A lot  of people came, but they didn   t have any way to get back. They only  had the funding to get here, and so a lot of those people were becoming  a big burden to our social service system here because of a lack of  funding to take care of all the needs. We had a tent city out on the east  side of Tulsa, and at one point there were about 1,500 homeless people  on the streets. And of course, when weather was bad   or when it was  8  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  good   they would migrate to the public library   which was great,  because the public library is for everyone. But it became such an  overwhelming number that we couldn   t control it. And then I began to  get lots and lots of criticism from the community, because people didn   t  want to come to their central library and not find a place to sit because  there was a homeless person there.  So the first thing we did was talk to law enforcement officers and put a  little coalition together to figure out how we could crack down on this  problem. It didn   t work, and it was not the way to go. So the next thing  was, I went to the Community Service Council and said,    The problem  that we   re facing at the central library is a community problem. Would  you pull together community people who care about the homeless and  see if we can do something to make it a better situation?    So the  director, Phil Dessauer, Jr, did call together a group. I think were about  15 of us representing different social service agencies, and the law  enforcement here in Tulsa. We decided to do research. We checked  with other communities, because this was a time when there were  problems all across the country. We found that there were a lot of really  inhumane processes that were being used. For instance, putting poison  in the garbage   in the trash   so that, when they went through to try to  forage for food, they would run into poison. There were communities  that would gather them up at sundown and forced them outside of the  city limits, and lots of different things. It was all because of frustration,  you know   how do we handle this social problem?  So we decided that we were going to create a day center for the  homeless, and Tulsa Metropolitan Ministry stepped up and said,    We  will run it.    There was one that was created, and today, we have a  really, really great program here in Tulsa. But for the first time, back in  those days, the homeless had a place to go and take showers. They   d  been bathing in the central library restrooms prior to that. They had a  place to go when it was cold or hot. They had a place to get clean  clothes, and it goes on and on. So I   ve always felt that Tulsa is a special,  special community. I think that proved the point that, when there was a  severe problem, people came together to find a positive solution to make  lives better for others.  Let   s talk a little bit about technology changes. Through your time, I   m  sure you saw a lot of shifting of technology.  (Laughs) That   s right, and it   s amazing to go back and look, because I  started out, of course, when you signed your name on the check out card.  Then we went to the printed cards   I can   t even remember the name of  the huge machines   and you put a card in there. It was the beginning of  the computerized age. At one point, at the central library, there was a  9  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  very large area that was leased to Tulsa County for them to house their  computer. It, of course, had to be on a special floor at that time and had  to be maintained at certain temperatures. It was about a third of the size  of one floor of the central library   for the Tulsa County computer. We  were part of that whole thing. So we knew it was coming, and it   s just  marvelous what   s happened since then. But yeah, I went back to the  very beginning, and it   s a much better way to do it now.  Your system that you helped grow so much   do you have a favorite  building that was created during that time? A favorite renovation  project?  During the time that I was there, we enlarged or built all of the branch  libraries, and I think there were 23 when I left. No, there   s no favorite.  Every community was totally different. Every library was totally  different, though the footprint might have been the same. They were  designed to fit into the community; no favorites.  That   s a very diplomatic answer. (Laughter) Do you have those  touching stories where it just makes everything worthwhile when you  were working in the libraries? Those    Wow, I just love this job     moment?  Well, I guess the one that comes to mind first is the back to the  homeless. One day, a young man came in and said that he wanted to  talk to me. So he was shown in, and he sat down   very well groomed,  nice young man. He said,    I want to tell you what has happened to me.  I want to thank you for making the public library so accessible to  everyone.    He apparently had developed a drug problem, and his family  couldn   t deal with it anymore. So he was on the streets and he felt that  the only place he could go was the library. So he said he actually lived  in the library for a couple of years, and then somehow he was able to  find help and was able to get off of the streets. But he said that he  appreciated so much, and he didn   t know where he would have gone in  those difficult days if he hadn   t had a place to come and get out of the  inclement weather   but also a place where he could sit and read and  develop while he was going through this difficult time in his life. So  that was one.  Then another was the program that we created and that is bringing an  author in each year. It   s a distinguished author program, and it   s now  called the Peggy V. Helmerich Distinguished Author program. We  named that after Peggy for all the things that she did to help the library  with the endowment. But, that   s where an author that has made a  contribution to a body of literature is invited to come to Tulsa. There   s a  black tie dinner on Friday night on the main floor of the central library.  10  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  This continues today, and it   s really one of the best things that happens  to the Tulsa community every year. You go to a lovely dinner. You get  to hear a speaker   an author. Toni Morrison was here two years before  she won the Pulitzer Prize. And you look at the people like John Updike  and Eudora Welty and those people who really made the contributions of  literature. To have had an opportunity to meet those people and bring  them to Tulsa   Friday night is very special, and they have about 450  people for that dinner. But the next morning, it   s open free of charge to  the public, and that   s when a lot of students and teachers and families  come down to meet an author face to face. That   s a great program.  Well, how did retirement come about?  Well, I started working at the Tulsa Library when I was 23, and at 55, I  decided that I wanted to do some things I couldn   t do while I was  employed in that position. Through the city, early retirement was  available to me at that time, and I had seen things recycle so many times.  I just didn   t really want to deal with those things again. But the other  thing was that the library system was in great shape. We had just  completed a new ten year strategic plan. We were very healthy  financially, and there about 280 people on the staff. Every one of them  was a fantastic person. So I just felt that I had done all that I should do,  and that it was time to move on.  You made a bid for state senate?  Yes. Yes.  Were you always interested in politics? Did you always have that  inkling?  Not, really. The reason I did that was, I spent a lot of time at the Capitol  lobbying for library issues all through my career, for educational  projects and issues. I became really frustrated, at that particular time,  with our state legislators, because I didn   t feel that they were doing what  they should and could do for our educational system in the state and also  for libraries. So I thought   might as well give it a try. It was a difficult  time because of the timing on my retirement, I only had four months to  actually campaign. I couldn   t campaign while I was on the job, and I  had a terrific group, 100 volunteers. We raised a  100,000 for that  campaign, which was supposed to be a district where you could get in  for  50,000   or that   s what it would take for your campaign. In four  months, we   the volunteers and I    knocked on 7,000 doors, and so I  was just physically worn out by the time we got to the election.  I did not win. I was disappointed for about three days. My husband was  11  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  elated, because, though he had done everything to support me, he really  wanted me to be in Tulsa with him all the time and not be gone during  the session. So it was a great experience, and I met so many good  people. I know in the political system that you usually go in and try the  first time, and you can lose or whatever. But I never had any desire to  go back and run again. I felt that I could do things and be more effective  and productive in going different directions in trying to do what I  wanted to accomplish.  So, after the bid for state senate, tell me what was next.  Well, let   s see. That was in November, and in January, I went to the  rector at my church. I   m a member of Trinity Episcopal Church, and I  never really had gotten involved in the church as far as the workings.  And so, I asked him if I could do something to help the church if I gave  a year to the church, and he hired me for a dollar. I was administrative  assistant to the rector, and I was actually a management consultant, is  what I really went in and did. It was at a time when in our church a lot of  things   it was a very, very old church   were not really run in a  business-like manner. So I developed job descriptions and a policy  manual and worked   had an opportunity to sit in on all the clergy  meetings with various committees of the church. And, it was a real  learning experience. I benefited a lot from that year, being at the church,  and I hope that I gave a little bit during that time that helped make it a  better place.  Nowadays, you   re in a very interesting position. You   re working with  the Oklahoma Centennial Botanical Garden?  Yes. While I was at the church, I decided that I wanted to take the OSU  Master Gardener program   or become involved in the program, which  is a four month program, one day a week. My husband, who is still  working, said,    I don   t have time to do it. You go and get all the  information.    And I thought,    Yeah, I   ll go,    because we garden  together. I thought,    I   m gonna show him all the things he   s been doing  wrong all these years.    Well, actually, I found out he   d been doing all  things right, but it was a pretty difficult time for me, because I had not  really taken any courses like that for quite a long time, where I had an  exam every week and we had little study groups.  During that time, Barry Fugate, who is the father of the Tulsa Master  Gardeners, kept saying,    I have a dream. Someday, Tulsa   which is the  only city of its size without a botanical garden   will have a botanical  garden.    So when the program was over and I graduated, I went up to  him one day and naively said,    You know, Barry, if you ever want to  pursue that and I can be of any help to you, let me know.    Then two  12  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  weeks later, he invited me to a meeting in his office. It was Barry  Fugate, D.C. Coston who was head of the OSU Extension Program from  Stillwater   Dan Zoladek, a recent retired executive Coke Industry from  Wichita, and myself. So we sat there and brainstormed for, oh, about  three hours, and we decided that, together, we were going to set out to  create and develop what would one day be a world class botanical  garden for Tulsa. I can still remember walking out and thinking,    Oh,  maybe I have one more project in me. I   ll give three years to this.    We  are now entering the   this is nine and a half years now that I have been  involved with them.  Wow. What is its status right now?  Well, it took a long time to plan, because we were convinced that we  were going to lay a firm, solid foundation. We   re planning a garden  that   s going to be here 100 years from now, and we wanted to do as  much as we could to create something that would cause as few problems  as possible for those who follow us   as far as the governance of the  garden and the structure and the funding and all of that. So it took  several years to get all that in place. We did site visits, went to different  places around the country, talked with boards, directors, and staff.  We now, at this point   it   s a  40 million dollar project   and the OSU  Foundation provided the funding to hire one of the most prestigious  botanical planning firms in the country, Marshall Tyler Rausch from  Pittsburgh. They were hired to help us select a site and to develop a  master plan. So we put together the criteria for what we wanted in the  site, and we spent about three years finding the right site. We had 21  sites we considered at one point. We narrowed it down, and Marshall  Tyler Rausch came in. We had three, and they immediately selected  one, which they said was one of the best sites for a botanical garden  they   d ever seen in this country, and they   ve worked on every major  botanical garden that there is. It was owned by Williams Companies at  that time, and we worked with them for a year and a half. They called in  a consultant; they were going to give us land. Then the bottom fell out.  Williams had financial problems, and they had to sell all the property.  So we weren   t about to give up, and we went around trying to get  different entities or individuals to buy this whole complex because it is a  conference center and has 1,100 acres attached to it. We were finally  able to find two young entrepreneurs who were looking for a long term  investment. They bought the whole thing. They are now running the  conference center, which is called Post Oak Lodge. They gave us our  choice of where we wanted the garden, and we have 240 acres that have  been given to the garden. We have five educational partners: OSU, OU,  University of Tulsa, Tulsa Technology Center, and Tulsa Community  13  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  College. A true botanical garden is more than just a beautiful garden. It  has strong education and research components, and so that   s why we had  the educational partners. Each president or head of those institutions  appoint two members to our board of directors, and the board selects the  other members. We have a 15 member board. We have a 48 member  honorary advisory board.  We received  2.2 million from the Oklahoma Centennial Commission,  and we were able to break ground in November and start construction on  a seven acre lake that has an island and will house an oriental garden, an  entrance road, and also a temporary visitor center. That was started in  February. We dedicated the visitor center in April. It was a real fast  track job, because the centennial money had to be spent before they went  out of existence. The lake and the entrance road will be completed in  August.  We started a membership drive; we have 675 members now. We don   t  have a garden yet. We have a newsletter   quarterly newsletter. We  have quarterly meetings for them. We have received   we   re in the  middle of a  15 million private sector fundraising campaign, and we  have received some nice pledges   one of which is  1.5 million from the  Hille Foundation to construct the children   s garden. When it   s all  completed, there will be 15 major gardens, 60 specialty gardens, an  education building, a visitor center, an orangery, conservatory, interfaith  chapel, a 3,000 seat amphitheater on the side of the lake, and that   s what  we   re doing.  Wow, that sounds like quite a project.  It is a big project. (Laughs) You can   t think of the whole, you just take  little bits and pieces at a time, but it   s all going together. We   ve  received tremendous support from everybody.  Well, that   s wonderful. Well, we learned the tools of the trade and  different things we need in different places for our careers. Where are  some of the most important places you have learned the background you  needed for your career?  I believe that I learned a lot of skills through scouting. I can remember  as a Brownie clutching my little nickel in a handkerchief as I went to my  Brownie meetings at seven years old. I stayed in scouting through my  senior year in high school, and I was a camp counselor and of course, a  camper for many years. I attribute a lot to the scouting program. I think  it   s tremendous, and people I know that have been in scouting   I think  they feel the same way I do.  14  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  Nykolaiszyn  Any major stumbling blocks you faced along the way?  A lot. You can   t go through life as long as I have been here and not, but  I don   t dwell on those things. My feeling has always been, okay, so  there   s some disappointments; there   s some setbacks. Just pick yourself  up and just keep going.  All right, so the big highlights of your career. It could be multiple.  Okay. That   s good. That   s good (laughs) because they are multiple.  Going back to what I said earlier, being named the director of the Tulsa  City-County Library system was very, very important to me and a big  highlight. The next one was being elected president of the Public  Library Association; that was a real honor. Being inducted into the  Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame was   I was very honored and  humbled to join that group of women then and to still be a part of that  group as it continues to grow and more women are inducted into the Hall  of Fame. And then the other was seeing the actual construction begin  after nine and a half years on the Oklahoma Centennial Botanical  Garden.  Well, going back to the Hall of Fame   when you were notified that you  were going to be inducted, what was going through your mind?  Well, I was taken aback. I was overwhelmed. I was really, really  surprised. But I had a quandary, because I was, at that time, president of  the Public Library Association. The night I was to be inducted was the  night I was to be conducting a meeting in Chicago for the Public Library  Association and had been committed to that for a long period of time.  The Public Library Association at that time had, I believe, about 7,500  members. So I said to   and I don   t remember who notified me,    I am  very honored. I   m humbled, but I can   t come to the induction. I just am  committed to the other, and I can   t let them down.    They were gracious  enough and kind enough to say,    That   s fine. We   re going to go ahead  and say you   re an inductee, and then we will actually invite you to the  dinner the next year.    So it was the following year when I was actually  there for the program and had an opportunity to participate.  Do you remember much about that night, where it was held?  Oklahoma City? No, I really don   t. I really don   t, except, my husband  was there, and a lot of friends were there. It was a lovely evening.  Now, how do you feel that a lot of people nowadays   I mean from what  I   ve read, you were always very encouraging with your staff to pursue  additional degrees   getting their library degrees. How do you feel that  15  Woodrum  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  now people look to you as that role model?  It   s a hard question to answer. I don   t know that I can really see myself  as a role model. I don   t see that. I just see myself trying to continue to  help people and encourage them as I go along. I have a little prayer I  say every morning before I get out of bed, and that is,    that in this day, I  can do something to help make life a little easier, a little better, or a little  more pleasant for someone.    I guess that   s really my philosophy, to  continue to do what I can to encourage people and to help them along  their life   s journey.  Would you like to mention or make note of anybody who has helped play  an important role in your life?  Yes. My husband. I am blessed with a wonderful, wonderful husband  who has really been the wind beneath my wings. We were very  fortunate, because he has always been in the financial world. His  contacts and his networks have helped me in my endeavors in raising  money and helping the library and the garden. He   s a very upbeat,  optimistic person, and I   m that way, also, but he   s more so. Whenever I  run into a problem or something, he is always there to encourage me on,  and I feel, as I said, very blessed to have met Clayton when I was 14.  And I think   I kind of lose track of time   I think we   ve been married  46 years now.  Tulsa seems to have this great sense of community. What does Tulsa  mean to you?  We have had, through my husband   s various positions, opportunities to  move to a lot of different places around the country. We have always  chosen to stay here. We have one son, and we have two wonderful  grandsons. We felt Tulsa was a good place to raise a family, and we  have so many friends in the area that it was the only place we ever  wanted to be. Tulsans care about the quality of life, and they support, I  believe, the important things to make life enjoyable. The interest in the  cultural areas, and the support of those   we very much like that. It   s  been said so many times. Tulsa   s a city that   s really a small town. It   s  just a great place to live. It   s the only place for us.  What advice would you give to other women who plan on following in  your footsteps?  Well, I think you have to be your own self. Family is extremely  important to me, but I feel that, to be effective in a family unit, each  member has to develop her or himself as an individual. I have done that,  again, through a lot of support from my husband. I think it   s extremely  16  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  Nykolaiszyn  Woodrum  important for women to go on and get an education, and I think it   s  extremely important at some point in their life for them to be a member  of the workforce, because those are skills that you learn, and you can  take into the home if that   s what you choose to do   stay as a  homemaker, but continue to grow and develop as an individual. I kind  of rambled on that. I guess I think it   s important to develop all the  talents that you can that God has given you and to make the most of your  life. I think you   re going to be happier if you do that and feel better  about yourself in every way   great self esteem by being around people  and knowing that you   re growing and developing, and never quit  learning.  If you could tell your fellow Oklahomans any piece of advice   not just  women   all Oklahomans   what would you tell them?  I would say that we need to continue in the state of Oklahoma, and we  need to participate in doing this, in helping the education system that we  have and finding the adequate funding that is needed in order to educate  our children. I think some wonderful things have happened in  Oklahoma the last few years, with the leadership of our universities and  particularly with President Boren, that he has brought some things to  Oklahoma that we   ve needed very badly, the level of standards and with  the Rhodes Scholars, and all of the chairs   both OU and OSU, that the  private funding has been raised for to endow chairs matched by the  legislature. I think we as Oklahomans need to support those types of  efforts to continue to keep our children in the state, to make it a place  where people want to come, and to help it keep growing.  When history is written about you, what would you like for it to say?  That   s a really difficult question. (Laughs) You   ve asked a couple of  them, but that is. I guess I would say that I would like people to say that  I did my best to help make the world a better place and make life easier  for others.  Is there anything you would like to add that we haven   t mentioned  today?  I am just very honored to have been selected for this interview. I thank  you very, very much.  Well, we appreciate you sharing your story with us. Thank you very  much for your time today.  Thank you.  -------  -------
