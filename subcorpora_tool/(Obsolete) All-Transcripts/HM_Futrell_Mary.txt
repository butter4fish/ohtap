Story_ID: 111459
Speaker 1: Now, if you will, Dean Futrell, tell us a little bit about your mother, starting with your mother's name, and where she was born, and where she grew up as a child.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My mother's name was Josephine Hatwood [Calloway Austin].  And she grew up in the Evington, Virginia area down near Lynchburg [Virginia].  And her parents, her father [Will Hatwood] was from North Carolina, and her mother [Louisa (ph.) Hatwood] was from the Evington area.  And they lived in West Virginia for about the first, I think she said eight or nine years of her life.  He was a coalminer, and then he became very ill.  And so, when he became ill and passed away, then the mother took the five children back to Evington.  And they had nine children, but five of them lived to be adults.  Four of them did not live to be adults.  And within a year, my mother's mother died.  My mother's father's name was Will, and her mother's name was Louisa [ph.].  And we think she had, they both had tuberculosis.  And so, by the time my mother was ten, she and her four brothers and sisters were orphaned, and they were raised by my mother's mother, my grandmother, up in the country.  So, they went from living in like Charleston--I think it was Charleston, West Virginia where they raised--and living in like a city to move to the country.  And they went from living like middle class--in those days, African Americans to being very poor and being farmers, my mother had to drop out of school when she was about eleven years old because she was the one responsible for having to take care of her brothers and sisters.  And then when she was twelve years old, she ran away from home because she said her grandfather was so mean to her.  And I guess it was the sort of situation where when the other kids did things, she was the one that got the punishment, even though she wasn't the one who did it.  So, she ran away at age twelve and started working.  And--
Speaker 1: What kind of work did she do?
Speaker 2: She worked, she was a maid.  She cleaned houses and things like that.  And she learned how to sew.  And I remember she told me, she said one of the first dresses she made was for her younger sister.  And she went back and she, you know, took the dress and she tried it on and everything.  And she was, she had promised her mother and her father--and I didn't know this until a few years ago--that she would take care of her younger brothers and sisters.  Now, she was not the oldest, she was next to the oldest.  She had a brother who was older than she was.  But she promised her mother and her father that she would take care of all her brothers and sisters.  And when I learned that, that was when the youngest sister died about a year and a half ago, and my mother was there.  And she told us that she had, that's when she had promised her my mother.  So, it was sort of like, "Okay, now I'm finally finished, you know, because this is the last of siblings."  But she was a very courageous young lady.
Speaker 1: And even though she ran away, she would still come back and visit the other kids, and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Right, right, she would go back and she would visit.  And then I don't know when she moved to North Carolina, but she ended up going to North Carolina for a while, and then evidently she came back to Virginia.  It must have been like when she was about maybe nineteen--eighteen, nineteen, something like that, you know.
Speaker 1: And did she--
Speaker 2: But my father's parents were from North Carolina.  So, I don't know where--she doesn't like to talk about her family.  And so, what I find fascinating about my mother, is in recent years we spent a lot of time driving.  And it's like when we're in the car driving, she'll start talking.  But all these years, she's rarely talked about her family, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, did she live with the families that she worked for, that she did domestic work for?
Speaker 2: Right.  She lived with them, and up until--we must have been about maybe eight or nine years old before she started just doing day work.  But before that, you know, she would live on the place with them.  They would have like a little house or something where she could live, yeah.
Story_ID: 111460
Speaker 1: Did she ever--actually, how would you describe your mother [Josephine Calloway Austin]?
Speaker 2: Um, my mother is a very hardworking woman.  As a matter of fact, she teases my sister [Ann Wynn] and myself about how much we work.  And we say, "Mama, we got it from you."  She, you know, when we were growing up, we didn't see her a lot, because she would work like eighteen hours a day.  And I was telling my niece that when we would get up she would be gone, but she would have food cooked on the stove for us.  And by the time we would get home, she would have come home and fixed food and gone back to work.  And usually by the time we would go to bed, you know, she maybe would be there.  Because she would like clean houses during the day, and then she'd clean like stores and shops and things like that in the evenings.  And so, we didn't get to spend a lot of personal time with her.  And I can remember vaguely her going to church with us.  But even though she couldn't go to church--because in those days if you were doing day work, you worked on Sundays as well.  So we didn't get to spend a lot of time with her, but she would make sure we went to church.  And she was a very honest woman, a very smart woman.  And I've often wondered, if my mother had been able to finish school, what would she have become, what would have happened to her?  Because she had to drop out when she was in the sixth grade.  But I mean when you listen to her and when you talk to her, you see that obviously she's a very, very intelligent, very bright woman.  And but as I said, she had to drop out of school, but she was a hardworking honest woman, a very strict disciplinarian, and had high standards for us.  She made, I mean, she made a home out of no home.  She loved to cook, an excellent cook; I wish I could cook like she cooks.  Sew, she likes to sew, and she loves to garden.  Neither one of us took that after her.  But whether in the house or outside, she was an excellent gardener.  People like her.  Now she's eighty-five now, and the people in the neighborhood take care of her.  You know, she's the mother of the neighborhood.  And so, basically she's the kind of person--she made a commitment, as I said, to take care of her four brothers and sisters.  She keeps her commitments, she keeps her promises.  And she raised us that way--you know, it's not what you have, but it's who you are as a person, is basically the way she raised us.
Story_ID: 111461
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your father, starting with your father's name and where he was born, and where he grew up as a child?
Speaker 2: My mother and my father were not married.  But he was, his name was Chester, and his last name was Minnis, Chester Minnis.  And he was from Altavista [Virginia].
Speaker 1: How do you spell Minnis?
Speaker 2: M-I-N-N-I-S.  And his family was very affluent, very well-educated, and my mother [Josephine Hatwood] was not.  And a lot of things I learned that I didn't know--I didn't realize that when I was born, at first the family didn't want to own me.  And then later my mother was telling me--this is again when we're driving in the car--about how they tried to take me away from them, you know.  And my mother didn't realize what was going on until--   she worked for the sheriff, and the sheriff started asking her all these questions.  And when she started to say, "Why are you asking me so many questions?" well, that's when she found out that the family was trying to take me away from her.  And the thing that, again, saved that from happening, was she was a very good mother and she kept a clean house, a good house.  And their point was, had she left us alone and stuff. And she said "Yes, but I go back and check on them."  Because she had to work.  And I didn't really know my father until--I remember I was with my cousins one time, and we were on a flatbed truck, and we were driving through Altavista.  And my father was an alcoholic, and my cousin said, "Do you know who that is?"  And this guy was stretched out in the middle of the street, and I said "No."  He said, "That's your father."  And I said, "Well, what's wrong with him?"  I said, "Why don't somebody stop and pick him up, you know, he must be hurt?"  And they started laughing.  Well, see, I didn't know what was going on.  And I really didn't meet him until I was about, I must have been about eleven or twelve years old.  And he came to visit one night, and I'm thirteen, and he brings me a can of milk.  And my mother wanted me to call him "Father," and I refused.  And I said, "No, because I don't know him, I don't know him."  And my mother in the meantime got married, and she married a gentleman named John Ed Calloway, and he was the one who I called my father.  He was the one who basically made a home for us, and you know, was there looking after us.  But unfortunately, he died when I was about four and a half years old; he had liver problems and things like that.  And the reason we ended up moving from Altavista to Lynchburg was because they didn't have a hospital in Altavista.  The hospital was in Lynchburg, so we had to go to Lynchburg, because he was on dialysis and all that.  And he died when I was about four and a half years old.  And my mother made a promise that she would never get married again until we were grown.  And I have a sister, Ann.  Ann is about two and a half, about two years older than I am.  And so she kept her promise; she didn't get married again until we were about, until we were grown.  And then she married a gentleman, and his name was Austin.  And, but, I think I must have told you her name was Josephine Calloway Austin, that's my mother's name.
Story_ID: 111462
Speaker 1: And in the meantime, you know, I was, I didn't know my father [Chester Minnis] at all.  And I went to see him.  Let me back up.  I didn't know the family either, and they basically disowned me.  And when I became a debutante--I was selected in Lynchburg [Virginia] to be a debutante.  And in those days when you made the honor roll, they would put your name in the paper, all of the kids and things. That's when they started owning me, you know, acknowledging who I was.  And I remember I went away to college, and I didn't have money.  I was one of those kids nobody thought would go to college.  And I maintained my grades and I ended up--well, I didn't think I'd go, either.  No one in my family had been to college except for my father's side, and I didn't know them.  And I didn't have enough money to stay in school, and I went and asked him if he would loan me a hundred dollars.
Speaker 2: Your father?
Speaker 1: Yes, my real father.  And he said no.  And I said, "Well, what about fifty dollars?" And I explained to him, you know, and I said "I'll give it back to you."  And he said he didn't have it.  And I said, "What about ten dollars?"  And he said, no.  And I, I wasn't going to go back to school, because I didn't have the money.  And I called Virginia State University [Petersburg, Virginia], and I told them.  And they told me that they were sorry, you know, that I didn't have it.  And I thought it was over.  And then about a week before school started, they called me and told me that they had made arrangements for me to come back.  And so I went back, but for a long time I guess I kind of resented my father, because he could have helped me; he could have done for me; he could have owned me; a lot of things he didn't--by the way, we look just alike.  My father and I look just alike.  And I don't know, my mother [Josephine Calloway Austin] raised us not to hate.  And my mother raised us in the church, and all that.  And so I just said, no, I'm not going to go through my life hating anybody.  You know, I'm not going to do that.  And I would go visit him every once in a while and, you know, he would promise--by then I had graduated from college, and he would promise he would come see me, but he would never come.  And I still--something just said, "No, don't live with hate.  You know, don't do that."  And when I would go back home, I would go by every once in a while and see him and everything.  And the last ten years or so, you know, something just said "Get to know your father," you know, because by that time I knew he was sick and everything, and I began to spend time with him.  And it was funny, because I walked in his bedroom; I'd never been in his bedroom.  And he had a picture of me on the wall, and I was shocked.  And the picture that he had on the wall was when I was the president of the Virginia Educational Association.  And I said, "Well, where did you get that picture?"  And he said, "It was in the newspaper."  And he said--well, it was in a magazine--he said, "I put it on the wall."  And that was the only picture that he had on the wall.  I was just so surprised.  And so, we were sitting and we would talk, you know, and everything.  And I remember we would talk about what it was like growing up.  And my father--that's what I recall.  And I remember I had gone to see him in the hospital one time, and he was hooked up to all these tubes and things.  And I thought he was dying, and they may have thought the same thing.  But I thought about when I went to see him those last ten years--every time I had seen him, after about maybe fifteen or twenty, I thought he was dying every time I went to see him.  But you know, that wasn't so.  And he would ask me why wouldn't I call him father?  And I said, "I know you're my father," I said, "but I can't call you father because you've really not been a father to me.  But I respect you, and I will call you Chester."  And that's what I called him, I always called him Chester, and he said that was okay.  He said, "I understand, that's okay."  And his sisters, he had a couple of sisters who were very close to me, and very close to my mother.  As a matter of fact, they were the ones who named me, and I didn't know that until I talked to my mother.  But his two, some of his sisters named me, and I was named after some people in his family.  And, but by the time he passed away a couple of years ago, we had become pretty close.  And I really was very grateful that I had not grown up bitter and hating.  And obviously there are times when I look back and I wish I had gotten to know him better, you know, I wish I had spent more time with him, especially when I listen to his children.  He did get married; I think he was married like twice or something.  When I listened to them talk, I mean, obviously there were relationships that they had, and they knew, that I didn't have.  And, you know, but at least I got to know him and everything.  And we got along fine, you know, and we both forgave each other, you know.  And I said, "Well, I'll still call you Chester."  (Laughter).  He said, "Okay."  And that was basically it.
Story_ID: 111463
Speaker 1: What can you tell us about your grandparents?  Did you spend a lot of--
Speaker 2: My grandparents?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: On your mother's side.
Speaker 2: My grandparents were Ozella and Charles Douglas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And they were actually your great-grandparents?
Speaker 2: My great-grandparents.  My grandparents, you're right, died, and I never knew them.  I've seen pictures of them, but I never knew them.  But the ones I called Grandma and Granddaddy, Grandma and Grandpa, they were Charles and Ozella Douglas [ph.], and they were--
Speaker 1: Could you spell Ozella?
Speaker 2: O-Z-E-L-L-A, I believe was the way she spelled it.  And they lived up in the country.  And my sister [Ann Hatwood] hated going to the country to live, but I loved it.  And I remember I used to like to climb the trees, and I used to like being outside, and things like that.  And they also had grapes, and I would go up in the tree and eat--you know, the vines would grow up in the trees and I would go up there and eat.  And we had to get up early, and I'm not a morning person, but we would have to get up early.  And we lived in like a log cabin, and I could, you know, stretch out in my bed and look through the roof and see the sky; it looked like there were holes in it, you know.  And they didn't have indoor plumbing or anything like that, and we'd go down to the creek and get the water and bring it up.  My sister hated living in the country, and I thought it was the greatest thing in the world.  And I didn't like the snakes, I hated snakes.  But I would get out there and help.  And they had a horse and they would plow, and I would go out there and help plow and help get the water.  And when they would wash clothes, my grandmother would wash the clothes, and you'd stretch them out on the bushes in the trees.  You know, that's the way you would dry the clothes; and you'd wash them by hand.  And when I look back I think well, my mother [Josephine Calloway Austin] is very much like my grandmother.  My grandmother was a hard worker, I mean she was the one in the family that just worked all the time.  And my mother's just like her, and my sister and I are just like my mother.  And she was, she was, she wore long dresses.  And my grandmother would tell me about what it was like when she was growing up.  And she told me, she said that her parents were slaves.  And the land that they had was the land that the slave owners gave to his slaves when they freed them.  And so, the land we had was the land that they had owned.  And they had kept--and it's still in the family; they kept it in the family.  And they didn't have running water, so you had to go down to the spring to get water; you had to go out to the bushes to go to the bathroom and stuff.  And she would talk about, you know, how they were taught to work, and how they had to scrub.  And she would, one time she said to me, she said, "I am as light as you are."  And she opened her blouse and she showed me her chest.  And she said, "I am mixed like you are."  And I don't know what brought the conversation up, but she was telling me all this stuff.  And she talked about--and when she dressed, she had a long dress on.  She used to wear a hat all the time, and she walked with a stick, and very determined, you know, walking where she wanted to go.  And it was no question that grandma was in charge of the family.  And what was interesting is that so many of us would go there and spend the summers with them, or spend time with them.  And then she, I remember she came to Lynchburg [Virginia], and she had never used the telephone.  And I can remember to this day my mother calling, and we were trying to get Grandma to answer the phone.  And Grandma couldn't imagine talking to Mama through this thing.  And we kept showing her how to do it, and that if we were doing it she could do it.  And she refused to talk on the phone.  And I can remember even when the dresses and things were short, Grandma wore long dresses.  And she would tell these stories about, you know, about childhood and growing up, and about Grandma and Grandpa.  And we would learn--I remember we used to make buttermilk and butter.  I remember we used to make ice cream.  I remember she used to can all the time.  I remember they used to go hunting, you know, catch animals and things.  And that's what they would bring back, and fix it.  So, when I go--it's funny sometimes when I go to restaurants and they talk about escargot and frog legs, I say, "Well, I was brought in the country, and that's the stuff we used to eat," you know.  So, she, she, she was the glue that held the family together, and everybody gravitated around Grandma.  And my grandfather ended up having a stroke.  You know, he ended up having a sun stroke, so he ended up being paralyzed the last few years of his life.  And Grandma was the one who kept everything going.  And so, when I look at Mama, and when I look at us, we're like Grandma.
Speaker 1: Why do you think she was pointing out to you that, you know, that she was mixed, and that she was light-skinned?  Why do you think she did that?
Speaker 2: Well, because my sister and I were the lightest two in the family.  And people would oftentimes--our relatives, our younger relatives would make fun of us because my family is darker than we are.  And they would, they would make fun of us.  And I think what happened is one day she knew we were upset, because they were teasing us and making fun of us.  Because my father [Chester Minnis] is very light, and so she got upset.  And she was, she was more upset with them than she was--and that's when she went like this, you know, "I'm as light as they are," you know.  And basically, she was trying to protect us.  And I think that's why she did that.
Speaker 1: And was she always covered up, for the most part?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she always wore long sleeves, long dresses and everything--
Story_ID: 111464
Speaker 1: And did she [Futrell's great-grandmother, Ozella Douglas (ph.)] ever share any stories with you about her parents, who were slaves?
Speaker 2: I don't remember, I don't remember.  She maybe, she probably did.  All I remember is she told us that they were slaves.  And I think she said they were freed when she was about twelve years old, and that the people who freed them gave them the land.  But they would continue to do work for the family.  They would like wash clothes and, you know, when they planted their crops and things, they would share, you know, with them.  But I don't remember, you know, what happened or anything like that.  And I know she had quite a few--I met one of her brothers.  His name was, I called him Uncle Steven [ph.].  And I know she had a sister that lived down in like, I think it was Florida, down in Florida or somewhere.  But other than Uncle Steven, I never, I don't think I ever met any of the--any of her brothers and sisters.  And my grandmother, my mother's mother, I think I met a brother and a sister.  But basically it was very isolated--very, very rural.  So, I think what happened was when the kids grew up, they just left.  See, they wanted to go to town.  They wanted to be in like a Lynchburg [Virginia], or a Roanoke [Virginia], or an Altavista [Virginia].  They didn't want to stay up in the country, and so they left.  And so there were very few of the family members still in that area.
Speaker 1: Did she ever talk about, could she remember what it was like before, you know, when she was free, when she was about twelve?  Did she ever talk about her very early--
Speaker 2: The only thing my grandmother would talk about is how young they were, and how early they had to start working, and how--I think she said she was the one who was working with those who were responsible for washing the clothes and things.  And she basically just talked about, you know, they didn't go to school, and that she self-taught herself.  And I remember she was telling me about how they would sit and--if they worked in the house and stuff, they would take the children's books, the white children, and they would take them and they would talk to the children, "What did you do in school, what did you learn?"  And that's how they learned.  But they would talk to the white kids, and the kids would tell them, "Well, this is what..."  And they would read, and then they would learn to read and how to do things.  And then what they would do, is at night they would be like in their cabins or wherever they were, and they would have the lanterns.  And they would teach each other what little bit they could learn about reading and writing and stuff like that, and math.  But she said--she was talking about they didn't go to school, and how important it was for kids to go to school and get a good education, and how she tried to make sure her children at least got a basic education and a primary education.  So--
Speaker 1: And was she very proud of that land that she owned?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh, yeah.  Well, not only was she, but the whole family.  Because like I said, it's still in the family.  And she made a point of--I remember one time she took us so we could see like this is where one part of it starts, and then this is what is over here.  And her brother, and I know one of her sons also lived on the property.  But the property was really in the name of the children of her mother and her father.  And, and, and she would show us--you know, we would walk, and she would show us where the boundaries were.  Obviously we didn't see all eighty acres, but we would see a lot of it, yeah.
Story_ID: 111465
Speaker 1: Dean Futrell, what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: I think (laughter) my earliest memories are, I refused to walk.  And, and I remember my mother [Josephine Calloway Austin] trying to get me to walk.  And she finally one day put me down and said, "If you don't walk, you're going to be right here."  And I remember chasing after her.  I stood there thinking she's going to come back and get me, and she didn't.  She said, "You're going to walk.  You're old enough to walk.  I'm tired of carrying you."  And I remember running after her, and she said "I knew you could walk."  And, and, and so after that--And believe it or not, she said when I was little, I was really fat.  She said I was really big and fat; and, and somewhere along the line I lost it, I remember that.  I remember I started going to school when I was about, probably about three, three and a half.  And again, living in a small town was different.  My mother worked all the time.  So, what the school--the African American schools and the black school teachers decided that they would let me come to school.  That was their way of helping to take care of me.  So, at three, three and a half, I was going with my sister Ann to school.  Now, Ann was almost two years older than I was.  And so, I would go to school and I would sit in with them, you know, in their classes and things.  And I think about today--you know, we talk about early childhood education; we talk about pre-kindergarten and kindergarten programs.  Well, those teachers let me go to school, and I think that helped me a lot as I moved through the grades.  I remember one time there was a flood, and we were in the house.  Mama was away working, and we were in the house.  I remember they came to get the people out of the house.  And somebody remembered to tell them that there were two children in a part of the house.  And it was my sister Ann and myself, and they came and got us out, you know; and, and, and I remember that.  I remember us living on the hill and living in somebody's apartment, and my sister Ann and I were there.  And I was trying to put wood in the stove, and wasn't paying attention, and put the hot thing on top of my hand.  And so for a long time I had a bad scar on the top of my hand, and it was because I forgot and put the stove cap on my hand.  I remember we got our own house.  I remember we--and it's still standing.  And whenever I go back to Altavista [Virginia], I go by that little house; it was a little bungalow.  And we had cats, and we had dogs, and Mama had a garden out back.  And I remember, I remember two spankings I got that were really bad.  One, my mother had a dog that was pregnant.  My mother told me to leave the dog outside, and I left the dog in the house.  And so, when we got home that evening, the dog had had the puppies.  But the dog was smart; the dog got up on the bed and had the puppies, "I'm not having these puppies down on the floor."  So, obviously when my mother got home, she was furious.  And the second thing that I remember about my growing up, I remember I was playing with matches.  It was Christmastime, and I was striking the matches and holding them.  And, and, and one of them burned down, and I dropped it because it was burning my hand, and the tree caught on fire.  (Laughter).  So, I told my sister, I said, "I'm going to go to bed."  I said, "I'm going to go to bed and go to sleep.  And when Mama comes home, I will be asleep.  Therefore, I will not get a whipping."  And Ann stayed up.  And when Mama came home, obviously she found the tree.  "What happened to the tree, Mary Alice?"  My real name, by the way, is Mary Alice. "Mary Alice was playing with matches, burned her hand, and the tree caught on fire."  "Well, where is Mary Alice?" "Mary Alice said she was going to bed, because if she went to bed, she wouldn't get a whipping."  My mother woke me up and spanked me.  I remember that.  One of the other things I remember, is I remember my mother [Josephine Calloway Austin]--we had to go back and forth to Lynchburg [Virginia] to see my [step]father [John Ed Calloway], who was in the hospital.  And I remember one time we were getting on the train, and Mama didn't get the stuff on the train fast enough, and the train pulled off.  And Ann and I were on the train, and Mama was on the platform.  And Mama was running, trying to tell them to stop, but see, they didn't see or hear her.  So, fortunately, she went back inside and she told them what happened, and they called ahead.  And they said, "Well, we got two children on the train.  When they get to Lynchburg, take them off and hold them there, and the mother will be on the next train."  And that's, I remember that.  I remember we were at the window trying to figure--Mama's outside and we're inside.  And what else do I remember?  I remember when we first went to Lynchburg, because we eventually moved to Lynchburg because we were going back and forth so much with my father.  That we lived in a house and we didn't have a phone.  Do you want to hear all these stories?  And Mama--we went to this house to use the phone, and we didn't realize it was a bootleg house.  And while we were in--
Speaker 1: What was a bootleg house?
Speaker 2: A bootleg house is where they sell illegal liquor.  And so, while we're in there using the phone--Mama's using the phone to try to call I guess to get a cab or something, and they raid the house.  And so, Mama was obviously panicked, but the people were interesting. They told them she just came to use the phone.  Because my mother doesn't drink or anything like that.  And so, they let us go.  I also remember going to school, and we didn't have clothes, and we would go barefoot.  And I remember the principal letting us come for about a week, and then he sent us home.  And he said, "They can't come to school without shoes."  And so, my mother had to go out and buy shoes for us, and we went back to school.  And I remember it was cold.  And, oh, when we didn't have the shoes, what we would do--when he sent us home, we didn't go home right away.  We went out in the cornfield, because next to the school was a cornfield.  So we get home, and Mama said "How was school today?"  "Oh, school was fine."  "What did y'all do?"  So, we had made up all these stories about what we did.  So Mama looks at us, and she starts crying.  So we're trying to figure out, okay, why is she crying, what's going on?  She said, "You were not in school today."  We said, "Yes, we were, yes, we were."  She said, "What did I tell you about lying?  You were not in school today."  We said, "Yes, we were."  "You were sent home because you didn't have shoes to wear.  So, where were you today?"  So, then we had to confess that what we did was went out and played in the cornfield.  And so, she went and got the shoes and things for us to wear.  And I remember also going to school--
Story_ID: 111466
Speaker 1: So, Dean Futrell, you were going to tell us another story about when you were in school.
Speaker 2: Well, the only other one was that when we [Futrell and her older sister, Ann] would go to school, we didn't have, like, my mother [Josephine Calloway Austin] didn't have money.  So, what we would wear is topcoats.  And she would take her, like, suitcoats and roll the sleeves up, and those would be our topcoats.  But her point was, it's not what you wear that's important; you go to school to try to get a good education and to better yourself.  And then we moved from Dearington over to White Rock Hill in Lynchburg [Virginia].  And we lived on a hill called Spruce Street.  And, and, and, there were four families living in the house, you know, two on each side, and one on the top and one on the bottom.  And there were only three houses on Spruce Street, and that's--I probably have more memories of Spruce Street than anything else.  And--
Speaker 1: I'll ask you about Spruce Street in a minute.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  One time the house caught on fire.  And I'm a very solid sleeper, and they came to get us out of the house.  And I was telling them I couldn't go, because I still had to sleep.  And the police and the firemen said, "You'd better get out of here."  And they made me get up and leave the house.  And when I got up, I said, "Why do I have to leave the house?"  They said, "Because the house is on fire."  And so when I got outside, I didn't want to go outside, but then I realized what was going on, that the house was on fire.  But it was like, things like, when I was growing up and I lived on Spruce Street, we didn't have a lot of toys and stuff like that.  So, I would do things like take the pole that you would use to hold up the clothesline, and I would use that to try to pole vault over the line.  And I was, I was always doing stuff.  I would do stuff like climb up in the trees and swing down by my legs, you know.  And I remember one time I was swinging down by my legs, and just about the time I swung down, my mother came down the hill.  (laughter).  And I was yelling, "Tarzan, Tarzan."  She said, "I'm going to tar your 'zan,' get off of this tree." (Laughter).  And we loved pets, you know, we always had cats and dogs.  And my mother raised chickens, and we had rabbits.  And we would take care of everything in the neighborhood.  Anything that got sick, or anything that got lost, we took care of it.  And, and, and it's funny, because anything that died, you know, like it was a cat, we would bury it.  You know, we would have a little funeral.  And we'd sing little hymns, and we'd read from the Bible, and we would take care of stuff.  And it was a rough neighborhood, you know, and I was telling some kids--I went over to a place over in Northeast Washington they call "Murder Alley."  And I was telling the kids, "Don't be judged by your surroundings."  You know, because sometimes you think that this is what my life is going to be like.  And I was telling them about how I grew up.  I said, "You know, I lived on the White Rock Hill side, it was the poor side of town."  I said, "I remember one time I came home and a man had gotten his throat cut, and he was out in the field.  And there was an ambulance, and the police and everybody was standing around trying to see well, what's going to happen to this man?"  I said, "On weekends we didn't go to the movies, because it was more excitement in the neighborhood than it was in the movies--people fighting and, you know, drinking and gambling and stuff.  Well, Mama made us stay in the house, you know, you couldn't go outside."  And, and, I said "You know, I looked at the poverty.  You know, people were poor.  We didn't have anything, but we helped each other in the neighborhood."  And I told them, you know, I was telling them, "Even though the people in my neighborhood weren't well-educated, for example, when we were, when we got out of school, you didn't go outside and just play or do anything.  You knew you had chores to do; you knew you had homework to do.  And the neighbors, even though they weren't well-educated, 'Mary Alice, have you done your homework?  Have you done your chores?' And you didn't talk back to your neighbors, you know."  And I was telling them about when I was growing up, my neighbors would say when the report card came, "We want to see your report card," so they could see what we had.  "You know you can do better than this, and you'd better do better."  And we were allowed to go out and play, you know, but you didn't fight, and you didn't do stuff like that.  My mother's motto was, "You don't start a fight, but if somebody hits you, you have a right to hit back."  And, and, you know, I was telling them about, you know, I can remember seeing women get beat up.  You know, I mean I can remember seeing women get beaten so badly that you would say there's no way they can survive, you know.  And you look and the police would come, and I said, "That was the environment in which I grew up, but I didn't let my environment control me, you know--"
Story_ID: 111467
Speaker 1: So, we moved from Spruce Street to Pearl Street, and it wasn't much better, you know.  And again, the neighbors would look after us.  And the stuff that we saw and that we experienced, you know. And Mama [Josephine Calloway Austin] had to work all the time, she didn't have a choice.  But the neighbors and the people looked out for you.  And sometimes I look back and I say, you know, how did I make it, you know?  And you look back, and to this day, when I go home, it's "Yes, Miss Eula," and "No, Mr. So-and-so."  You know, you didn't call people by their first name.  And when people talked to you, you paid attention and respected them.  And, and Mama, you know, my mama had a sixth grade education.  But Mama would, you know, like at the end of the six weeks, "Where's your report card?"  And she looked at that report card.  And I used to say to her, you know, I told my mother one time when I was president, I said, "I thought you hated me."  I figured I was president of the NEA [National Education Association], and I could say whatever I wanted to say.  We had moved into this nice, big fancy house.  So, my mother didn't say anything, you know, she was helping me unpack, and all this stuff.  And I said, "You know, when I was growing up, I wore the hand-me-down clothes.  You know, I wore the stuff that didn't fit, I wore the old stuff.  I had the homemade clothes."  I said, "And if I didn't make good grades, you know, you punished me, but you didn't punish Ann," etc.  And my mother in the meantime raised two or three foster kids.  Like, my mother's best friend died.  And in those days, if you had tuberculosis, people were afraid of you.  Her family would not take Mariann in.  And Mariann is named after Ann and myself.  Mariann's father wouldn't take her; nobody would take her, but my mother took her.  Because in those days, when you didn't--if a black kid was an orphan, if your family didn't take you, you got sent down to Petersburg [Virginia] which is where the crazy house is.  So, my mother took Mariann when she was five weeks old, and Mariann's mother died when she was eight months old.  Well, Mama gave Mariann brand new clothes all the time, you know.  And so, and Ann had new clothes.  But I had--a lot of times--but she had hand-me-downs and things, too.  So, I remember telling Mama, "You know, I really thought you hated me.  I really didn't understand why you treated me the way you did."  And I ran away from home twice, because she was so hard on me, you know.
Speaker 2: Where did you go?
Speaker 1: One time I ran to the edge--I got as far as the edge of town, and I turned around.  And one time I got a little further, and I came back because I got scared and I came back.  So, my mother was interesting, you know, she listened to all I had to say.  And so, I'm going upstairs, and I finally got it off my chest; I told her how I feel.  The next morning we get up, and my husband's [Donald Futrell] upstairs in the bed.  And I went downstairs and Mama was making coffee, and we were sitting there.  And Mama said "You had a lot to say yesterday."  I said, "Oh, God, I'm in trouble."  And she said, "I want you to sit down, and we're going to talk about this."  And I don't know what your mother used to do, but my mother used to hold our face like this, so you had to look at her; you couldn't look around, you had to look right at her.  She said, "You had a lot to say yesterday about the way I raised you."  And she said, "Well, I want to respond to your question."  She said, "I didn't know how to respond to you yesterday."  She said "I went to bed, and I thought about it a lot last night.  So, I'm going to answer your question."  She said, "A mother knows her children."  And she said, "I knew you, and I knew Ann, and I knew Mariann."  And she--and we'd gotten another foster child named Pat.  And she said, "If I had let you do what you wanted to do, you wouldn't be here today."  And she told me, she said, "I didn't have a lot of money."  And she said, "When I looked at you, and looked at Ann, and looked at Mariann, I figured that you could make it.  And so, therefore, you could wear the hand-me-downs and you could wear the homemade clothes.  But I had to help Ann, and give Ann a little more encouragement and support.  So one of the ways I tried to do that, is I wasn't as hard on her, because I knew what you could do.  You could excel academically, and I knew she was struggling."  She said, "With Mariann, Mariann's mother was dead.  And my way of trying to show love for her was to give her things, you know."  And she said to me, she said "Yes, you wore hand-me-downs and you wore Dan River dresses that faded when we washed them, and you still had to wear them."  She said, "But that's all I had, and that's all I could afford to give you."  And she said, "Yes, when you didn't make the grades you were supposed to make in school, I would punish you from one part of the grading period to the next."  Now, remember, I didn't say I was making F's, I just didn't make the grades she thought I could make.  And she said, "What happened is at the end of that grading period, the grades went up."  And I said, "You know, she's right."  By that time, obviously I'm just crying and everything.  And she said, "Parents show love in different ways.  And you love all your children, but all your children aren't the same."  And, and, you know, I really thought about that.  And she said, "If I had just let you make whatever grades you wanted to make; if I had not made you study and learn how to work and do things, then I don't know what would have happened to you."  She said, "You wanted to go off and just do whatever you wanted to do, and I had to keep tight reins on you, because I didn't want you to do that."
Story_ID: 111468
Speaker 1: I'd also asked her [Futrell's mother, Josephine Calloway Austin] about why she made us work so hard.  I mean, she made Ann and she made me work.  I mean, I started to work when I was twelve years old.
Speaker 2: When you say work, do you mean work in school, or work--
Speaker 1: Outside the house.
Speaker 2: Outside the house.
Speaker 1: Outside the house.  And, and, we had to work and do things.  And even in the house, she said, you know, she said, "Your [step]father was dead," meaning John Ed [Calloway]; John Ed was dead.  She said, "I didn't know what would happen to you.  And I'm reflecting on what happened to me when my mother and father died."  She said, "I wanted to make sure that if anything happened to me, that you and Ann could work and take care of yourself, and you could also help look after Mariann."  You know, and I stopped--and a lot of times I thought about that.  Now, she was a woman with a sixth grade education, but she understood the psychology and the ability of her children, and she understood what she had to do to prepare us for life.  And, and, her point was, like, she was reflecting on what had happened to her, you know, "And I don't want that to happen to you.  And I don't know whether, you know, family would take you or not."  You know, the family--I gather that part of what had happened was that when they had to go back home, some of the family members resented--all of a sudden here are five kids that we've got to take care of.  And, you know, and when she explained it to me, obviously I apologized, and I understood, you know.  And, but, you know, she pushed us and made us work.  And she also taught us that even when everything seems to be going wrong, don't give up.  You know, you keep pushing forward, you keep moving forward.  And she taught--and my teachers taught me, "When everybody else thinks you can't, you show them that you can."  And to this day, you know, that's the way I am.  But, but I started working when I was about eleven or twelve years old.  And, and Ann did the same thing.  We cleaned churches; we would clean stores; we would clean people's homes.  Mama would do stuff, like, she'd have four or five jobs.  And she would be over here, and I would be over here, and Ann would be over there.  So, we would cover the job for her.  And I remember I was home not long ago, and I was pointing out the churches that we used to clean.  And the Dairy Queen where we used to work is still there.  And I was pointing out where we used to do all that work, you know.
Story_ID: 111469
Speaker 1: Can you give your siblings' names in their birth order?
Speaker 2: Ann is my blood sister--
Speaker 1: Including yourself.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Ann is my blood sister, and Ann is almost two years older than I am.  And then Mariann is the one whose mother died, and she had tuberculosis.  Mariann is, Ann's name is Ann Wynn now, and Mariann's name is Mariann Biscoff.
Speaker 1: So it's Ann, then you.
Speaker 2: Ann, then me; then Mariann; and then Pat [Patricia], which is another foster child that my mother raised.  And then there's Caffie.  And, and, and Caffie didn't stay with us that long, but Mariann and Pat grew up with us.
Story_ID: 111470
Speaker 1: You talked a little bit about your street and your community.  Can you tell us a little bit more, just in terms of like a physical description?  Was there a corner store, that kind of thing?  Can you--
Speaker 2: Oh, well, when we lived on Spruce Street, there were only three houses.  On the side where we lived, there were two houses, and then on the other side there was a smaller house.  But if you went down--and Lynchburg [Virginia] is a very hilly place.  And so, if you went down the hill and went to the left, there were a couple of stores up there, but they had families all down, you know, in the other part.  And then when we moved up on Pearl Street, there were a lot more houses up on Pearl Street.  Oh, my gosh, I mean it must have been like maybe ten, fifteen.  But again, the store was down the hill.  And then up on Clay Street, that goes a long way, all the way up on the other side of town.  But the side of town where we were intersected with Pearl Street--well, Spruce Street is now gone.  Most of the houses on Pearl Street are gone.  And where we had the store and where we had the houses down in the valley part, the lower part, all those houses are gone, and that's now a highway.  And so, I would say probably seventy percent of the houses are gone now.
Speaker 1: Now, you talked a little bit about some of the violence that would take place.  And, you know, one would think you're talking about a big city, but here you are talking about Lynchburg.
Speaker 2: No, no, Lynchburg is about--when I was growing up there, about 45,000.
Speaker 1: And can you kind of describe Lynchburg at that particular time?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Well, Lynchburg geographically is up in the mountains, and it's right off the James River.  And it's called the "City of Seven Hills."  And obviously, when I was growing up it was very segregated.  I mean, I went to all-black elementary and secondary schools.  I rode the bus--when you rode the bus you sat in the back of the bus.  I was telling somebody I used to get in trouble all the time.  (Laughter).  When we would go work with my mother [Josephine Calloway Austin], even though the bus would stop at the front of the house, you had to go around to the back of the house.  And I remember saying to the lady, "Now, why do I have to go around to the back of the house, when the bus stops in front of the house?  Why can't I just walk through the front door?"  And my mother told me, "You need to be quiet, because I'll lose my job," you know.  But, yeah, I would ask questions like that, "Why do I have to go around to the back, and why do I have to do certain things?"  Lynchburg was a very religious town.  It's basically called the "City of Churches," and I understand there are more churches in Lynchburg, per capita, than any other part of the state.  Jerry Falwell is in Lynchburg, but when I was growing up, he wasn't there.  So, I tell everybody I was there first.  It's, it's, it's basically an industrial, semi-industrial farming area--Meade Corporation, which makes a lot of the paper.  There's a shoe factory.  They had a hosiery mill, a lot of stuff like that in Lynchburg.  And, and, and again, you know, like White Rock Hill and certain parts were all black.  And if you go to certain parts of Rivermont--you know, they were communities.  Diamond Hill Baptist Church was one of the largest African American black churches, not only in Lynchburg, but in the state.  Dunbar High School, we had one high school and about five elementary schools.  And, and, and, you know, one of the things I remember about the principal of Dunbar High School, I remember him telling us one time that he would go up and down the East Coast recruiting teachers who were professionally certified to teach, professionally trained, and with master's degrees.  And, and, and I remember I gave a speech this summer, and in doing research, I went back and looked at my yearbooks.  And what struck me was that the teachers who were there when I was like in the eighth or ninth grade, most of those teachers were still there when I graduated four years later.  And I also went back and looked at their degrees.  All but one had a college degree, and about half of them had master's degrees.  Well, see, back in those days that was virtually unheard of.  And--
Speaker 1: In the African American community?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yes, oh, yeah.  And, and, and I remember I was asking somebody, "Well, when the Brown [v. Board of Education] decision was handed down, what happened?"  And it was--but my mother told me, and other people, they said they kept it very quiet; they didn't make a big to-do out of it.  And it was basically by word-of-mouth and radio that people found out that the Brown decision had been handed down.  Now, I grew up about forty miles from Appomattox, Virginia, which is where they closed down the schools, and we didn't know that.  I didn't know the schools had been shut down until I went to college.  And I went to Petersburg [Virginia], they asked all of us to bring--they said "When you go back home for Thanksgiving, bring your old textbooks."  And then they explained that the Farm Bill which is part of Appomattox, that they had closed the schools, and they wanted us to bring our textbooks so they could give them to the kids.  And--
Speaker 1: Just for clarification, they closed the schools so they wouldn't have to desegregate?
Speaker 2: Desegregate, right.  But Lynchburg never did that.  Lynchburg didn't desegregate the schools until like the mid-1960s, which is interesting, and neither did Alexandria [Virginia]; Alexandria didn't desegregate its schools.  Because when I graduated, I was telling somebody it's interesting how you don't think about things until you're writing or something.  When they handed down Brown, I was a senior, no, I was a freshman in 1954.  When I started teaching in 1963, the schools were still segregated up here.  I taught in segregated schools for two years.  And Lynchburg is a pretty conservative place, you know.
Story_ID: 111471
Speaker 1: Tell me what sights, sounds, and smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Of growing up?
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, in your childhood.
Speaker 2: Hills, winter, sleigh riding.  Smells, my mother [Josephine Calloway Austin] cooking.  Sounds, birds. Birds.  Growing up, also what reminds me of Lynchburg [Virginia] is the happy spirit and the competitive spirit at Dunbar High School, and the fact that the kids challenged each other, and we had a lot of school spirit.  What reminds me of Lynchburg is Diamond Hill Baptist Church and being involved in the choir.  And I can't sing, but they let me join the junior choir anyway.  And the sounds... sounds... I think, I think a sound my mother... "Mary Alice, if you don't..." that was a sound that I remember from Lynchburg.

Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of your elementary school that you attended?
Speaker 2: Payne Elementary School [Lynchburg, Virginia].
Speaker 1: P-A-Y-N-E?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, Robert S. Payne.
Speaker 1: And do you remember some of your teachers there?
Speaker 2: I don't remember the names.  I remember, and I apologize--I remember my fourth grade teacher--and I don't remember the name, forgive me.  And how I remember, is she insisted that I study harder.  And I was a little smart-mouthed kid, I liked to talk back.  And she said, "I am not going to tolerate your mouth, and you are going to do the work."  I remember my fourth grade teacher.  I remember--
Speaker 1: What were some of your favorite subjects in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Reading.  To this day, I love to read, and I loved to read in elementary school.  I liked history.  I also liked, I liked science.  I didn't like math.  I can tell you what I didn't like, I didn't like math.  But no, I loved to read, and I loved, I liked science and history.
Speaker 1: And what kind of student were you in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Pretty good, starting off.  I, you know, I was a happy kid in school, I liked school.  And, but I liked to talk.  I got in a lot of trouble for talking.
Speaker 1: And during the elementary school years, did you have dreams and aspirations?  What did you think you would be when you grew up?  Did you think about that at all when you were in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, when you're in elementary school--I was telling someone the other day, you know, I probably was like a lot of kids.  I wanted to be a singer, or I wanted to be a dancer, or I wanted to--I'd like--I thought--I said well, maybe I'd like to be maybe a teacher.  But I didn't, I didn't think about going to college, you know.  But you want to be famous, you want to--you know, so I wanted to be a singer or a dancer.  And, and, and, teaching--but you know, you change your mind a lot.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 111473
Speaker 1: So, now did you go to junior high school and middle school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or was that part of elementary school?
Speaker 2: You'd just go straight to high school.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Eighth grade.
Speaker 1: So, during the junior high school, the middle school years while you were still at Payne--were you still at Payne [Elementary School, Lynchburg, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, Dunbar High School [Lynchburg, Virginia].
Speaker 1: No, during the junior high school years?
Speaker 2: Oh, you mean seventh grade?
Speaker 1: Right.  Like sixth, seventh, and eighth grades, were you still at Payne?
Speaker 2: Eighth grade, I was in high school.
Speaker 1: Oh, eighth grade was high school?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, so, sixth and seventh grade was at Payne?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, during that time were you still the same kind of student?  What kind of student were you, and what were some of your favorite subjects during the junior high school years?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, you got to remember in those days when you were still in sixth or seventh grade, it was basically like elementary, and you didn't have the separate classes like you got now.  And, and, and, so what you had--I remember I had a teacher who was a very strong disciplinarian.  And if we didn't march in line like she wanted us to march in line, she would--once the recess period was over, she would take us back outside and make us march in line again.  I remember, you know, basically as I said, it was reading, it was history, it was the science I liked.  My handwriting has always been lousy, you know, and I'm a left-handed person.  I was in things like the student government, you know, stuff like that.
Speaker 1: In junior high school?
Speaker 2: In junior high, yeah, because we had student government in elementary and junior high, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what were some of the things you enjoyed doing in your spare time, during the junior high school, middle school years?
Speaker 2: Oh, God, you're asking me to go back a long way.  Well, I liked to read.  And I, (laughter) well, my mother [Josephine Calloway Austin] would get after me.  I had discovered a place in my house where I could hide, and nobody could find me.  And I would take, I would have books in there.  And I would go there and I would read for hours, I would just read.
Speaker 1: What kind of books did you like reading?
Speaker 2: Storybooks, just books--fictional books, history books, anything.  And it was funny, because I could see my mother looking for me, but she couldn't see me.
Speaker 1: Where was your hiding place?
Speaker 2: Downstairs.  And it was downstairs, like the steps, but there was a place where you could go and nobody could see you.  And, and I finally told my mother about it, you know.  And, because she, I knew she was going to get me if she found me.  And I would just read.  I used to, I could read forever, and just read.  And I could get so engrossed in reading that I would forget--I became part of the story, part of whatever I was reading.  And I liked that.  I liked to dance, I always liked to dance.  And--
Speaker 1: What were some of your favorite groups or singers during that time?
Speaker 2: Oh, I liked people like the Chi-Lites, the Manhattans, and all those kind of people.  As a matter of fact, my family laughed at me.  And this summer, they gave me an oldies but goodies tape so I could listen to it.  Um, I liked, what else did I like to do?  I liked--you know, when you grow up in a place like Lynchburg [Virginia], you sit on the front porch a lot.  And so, I used to like to sit on the porch and just watch the people go by, and just talk.  And, and, see, in those days, we were the first ones in the neighborhood to get a TV.  And, you know, the TV, we would sit and look at TV.  And a lot of kids and other people would come around, because we were the first ones with a TV and everything.
Speaker 1: How was your mother able to afford the TV?
Speaker 2: On credit.  And basically she bought it, she said because she knew she was away a lot working, and the TV was to entertain us.  We had to do a lot of work, you know.  We cleaned house, we washed, we ironed, we cooked.  We basically did the stuff around the house, because my mother wasn't there.  And we started early, you know.  We took care of Mariann [Biscoff], took care of Pat.  You know, we had lots of dogs and cats.  I loved animals, so we always had dogs and cats and things like that.  I used to fight with Ann.  You know, it's funny, she was the only person with whom I would fight.  I'd fight with Ann [Wynn], and then we would make up and we'd look out for each other.  But those were basically the things that I would do.

Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about high school.  What was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: Dunbar High School [Lynchburg, Virginia].
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like at Dunbar?
Speaker 2: Absolutely wonderful.  Dunbar High School, the Fighting Poets.  One day when I was an eighth-grader--and I have some good memories and I have some bad, and I need to be honest about that.  What I remember most about Dunbar are the teachers, and how, you know, obviously most of us were poor.  And in Lynchburg [Virginia] at that time, if you looked at a structure, the people in the community who would be at the top were the teachers.  And maybe we had one, I think we had one dentist and a couple of doctors, and maybe one or two lawyers.  That was it.
Speaker 1: Did they live in your neighborhood?  Was your neighborhood--
Speaker 2: No, they were all over.  And see, Lynchburg was small, so where I went to church, a lot of my teachers went to church.  So, you couldn't misbehave in church either.  But, you know, everybody looked out for each other.  In high school, I was involved in the Future Business Leaders of America, I was in the student government, I was the head of the cheering squad, I was in the National Honor Society, a lot of things, you know.  And just to show you the kind of the kind of person--when I tried out for the cheering squad, I didn't make it.  And I decided that I would keep going to practice, keep going to practice.  And I kept going, and by the middle of the year, half of the cheerleaders had dropped out, and I became a cheerleader, because I kept going.  And the next year, I made the squad on my own.  And by the third year, I was captain of the squad.  And so, you know, we had good team sportsmanship, and everything like that.  The teachers worked us hard--
Speaker 1: Do you remember any particular teachers that may have influenced you?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, I remember a lot of my teachers.  I remember Miss Hughes [ph.], I remember Mrs. Cee [ph.], the principal's wife, who was my science teacher.  I remember--
Speaker 1: Just sit back in your chair a little.
Speaker 2: I get excited, sorry.  I remember Mr. Thornhill [ph.], my business teacher.  I remember Miss Jordan [ph.], I remember Miss Chaven [ph.], Miss Watson [ph.].  I remember Mr. Clark [ph.], my science teacher.  I remember so many of my teachers.
Speaker 1: What was your favorite subject in high school?
Speaker 2: In high school?  Business, because I was a business major, and that was my favorite subject.  I got in trouble, you know, I have to tell you a story.  Miss Jordan was my English teacher, and I liked to talk.  And I remember one time I was talking in class, and everybody stopped talking.  And I didn't realize that everybody had stopped talking.  And I looked up, and Miss Jordan was standing in front of the room, and she had this really stern look on her face.  And she said, "Miss Hatwood, I would like to see you after class."  And I'm like, "Oh, my God, what is she going to do?"  Well, we get out of class, and she's reprimanding me for talking.  But her punishment was I had to write an essay.  So, she made me write this essay, and I've told this story before.  She made me write it five times.  She made me write it once, and then she made me re-write it because of grammar, re-write it again because of spelling, re-write it again because of organization, and re-write it again because of punctuation.  And then she made me write it again just for good principle.  I said, "Now, why couldn't you just have me write it one time?"  "If you say anything else, young lady, you'll re-write it again."  Well, what she did was she took the essay and she put it, entered it into a contest, and she didn't tell me.  So, two or three months later, what am I doing?  I'm sitting in class, and I'm talking again.  And the class stops, and I look up and she's sitting there.  And she's got this very stern look, but there's kind of a smile.  And she announced that there had been a citywide contest, and one of the students in the class had won third prize, and I was the one.  I couldn't believe it; it was the first time I ever won anything.  And, and, and I--
Speaker 1: What grade were you in?
Speaker 2: I was, I think I must have been like in the tenth grade.  I still have that certificate, I still have it.  But I remember--
Speaker 1: What was your essay on?
Speaker 2: It was on something like education and the economy, something like that.  Because I was a business student, I wrote about, you know, my area.  But I also remember that I had asked to be in the academic program, and they didn't put me in the academic program; they put me in the general program.  And--
Speaker 1: Was the general program like a vocational--
Speaker 2: No, a general program overall.  But I took a lot of business courses.  But I had asked to be in the academic program.  And when I asked them why, basically what they said was--and see, at that time my mother [Josephine Calloway Austin] didn't realize she could have protested and insisted I be put in the academic program.  And it happens, it still happens a lot today.  And when I asked why they didn't put me in the academic program, they said because my family was poor and I probably wouldn't go to college, and they wanted me to get the skills that I would need to get a job.  And I didn't know that I could protest.  Well, in the eleventh grade, the early part of the eleventh grade, they gave us a test.  And I came in number five in the class.  Then they switched me to the academic program.  But see, I had missed ninth grade, tenth grade, and about half of the eleventh grade.  And they switched me over.
Story_ID: 111475
Speaker 1: So, we were talking about high school [at Dunbar High School in Lynchburg, Virginia].  So, you had finally got moved into the academic program.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Was it challenging for you, or were you able to hold your own?
Speaker 2: Well, I was able to hold my own, but obviously, I realized that much of what I should have acquired, I didn't have that foundation.  But fortunately, I was the kind of person I really tried, I really pushed myself, and really, you know, made sure that I wasn't going to fail, you know.  And I look back, and I look at the teachers, you know, who worked with me and helped me.  They were determined that I wouldn't give up, and they were determined that I would do the best that I could do.  And, and, I think about those teachers all the time.  And when I got, when I got ready to graduate from high school--and just to give you an example.  One of the teachers who never taught me came to me and told me that I had been, my name had been put forth for a scholarship, but the decision was made not to give it to me, because again, the assumption was I wouldn't go to college because nobody in my family had been.  And I remember Mr. Penn [ph.] telling me, he said, "Well, don't you give up."  He said, "You just keep going forward."  And I had, and I'm going to be honest, and say I had pretty much given up, you know.  Because I just assumed, you know, that you're not going to college.
Speaker 1: Well, what were your thoughts about college in high school?  Did you want--
Speaker 2: I wanted to go, but I didn't have the money.  And my family was poor, my mother [Josephine Calloway Austin] didn't have the money.  And I remember some teachers came to me, like in the fall semester of my senior year, and they told me to apply.  And they said, "You go ahead and you apply to college."  I said, "But I'm not going to college, why should I apply?"  And they said, "You apply anyway; you go ahead and you apply."  And so, I applied.  And then they told me like the early part of the spring, they said, "Well, Virginia has what they call forgiveness loans.  You go ahead and you apply for that."  Well, I went ahead and applied, and didn't hear anything.  And then it came time to graduate, and--
Speaker 1: What were the forgiveness loans?
Speaker 2: Like, if you go to college and you major in education, and if you teach, then they forgive the loan.  And--
Speaker 1: Were you thinking that you wanted to be a teacher?
Speaker 2: By that time I wanted to be a teacher if I could go be a teacher.  But I had pursued business courses all the way through, and I said well, I'll go ahead and get a job as a secretary or something like that, and work in the government or something of that nature.  And when I got ready to graduate, the teachers came on the stage the night that I graduated, and I didn't know that they were going to do this.  I think my mother knew.  And they gave me the money to go to college.  They had gone out in the community and they talked to businesses, they talked to churches, and they went to individuals.  And they said, "We have a young lady who's very bright."  Because I was like number, I think I was like number seven in my class by the time I graduated.  And when you calculated all the averages, I think I was like number seven.  And they said, "We have a young lady that we think will be able to succeed in college; she's very, very sharp."  And they collected, at that time, it was a lot of money.  Now, it's probably not very much, about fifteen hundred dollars, for me to go to school.  And it was interesting, because like about two or three weeks later, I learned that I had gotten the forgiveness loan.  And that's how I got the money to go to school.  And so, to this day, you know, when people hear me talk about my teachers, people should understand why.  You know, because I look back so many times when I wanted to give up, and they wouldn't let me.  It didn't matter whether I was studying English, math, science--whether I was playing in the gym class, whether I was typing or whatever, you know, they just wouldn't let me give up.  And not only did they not let us give up--and it wasn't just me--they made us strive, you know, to be better than what we were.  And I remember my teachers telling me, "You don't have to be controlled by your environment, you know.  You can be whatever you want to be, but you have to decide that that's what you want to do."
Story_ID: 111476
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Where were you thinking you wanted to go to college?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: If you could go to college, where do you think you wanted to go?
Speaker 1: I hadn't really thought about where I was going.  Because remember, no one in my family had been.
Speaker 2: Where did you apply?
Speaker 1: I applied to Virginia State [University, Petersburg, Virginia]; that was the only place which I applied.
Speaker 2: That was the only one.
Speaker 1: And, and, Virginia State accepted me.  But, again, like I said, I didn't think--I didn't have the money.  So, I'm assuming that I got accepted, but I'm not going, I don't have the money.  And--
Speaker 2: What year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 1: In 1958.  But I went away to college, and I remember going back and thanking my teachers; I went back and thanked them for what they had done.  And, and, and, mother [Josephine Calloway Austin] was excited, because when I went to school, you know--
Speaker 2: Did your sister, your older sister, Ann [Wynn], did she go to college?
Speaker 1: No, Ann didn't go to college.  And, and, Ann got married and had three girls, and I went on to school.  And I decided to major in business.  Because I said, well if I don't, if I'm not able to finish, at least I will get some additional skills and be able to get myself a better job.  And if I do finish, I can go back and help other kids, you know, get the training they need.  And so then when I got to Virginia State, you know, I majored in business education.  I became a cheerleader, I was a Delta, I was in the Delta Sigma Theta sorority.  I was in several different organizations; I can't remember them off the top of my head.  But again, you know, you had the teachers and the professors there who really pushed you.  And I remember, I fell in love.  And I spent a lot of time sitting out on the front lawn.  And I didn't realize that my advisor was walking past seeing me.  So, one day he called me into his office and said, "Miss Hatwood," he said, "How are you doing?"  I said, "I'm doing just fine."  He said, "I took the time to look up your grades.  You're not doing just fine."  And I said, "Oh?"  He said, "What is your major?"  And he knew my major, but I told him.  He said, "No, I think your major is love."  And I said, "Well, how do you know?  What are you talking about"?  Me with my smart mouth.  He said, "Well, I'm going to give you some advice."  He said, "You sit out on the front lawn with your boyfriend every day."  He said, "You're missing your classes."  He said, "You have a choice."  He said, "You either get yourself together, go to class every day, do the work you're supposed to do, or you're going to get a funny book, an orange, and a one-way ticket."  "Well, a funny book, an orange, and a one-way ticket, what is that?"  And he said, "Well, here at Virginia State, if you don't do what you're supposed to do, we give you a one-way ticket home, an orange to eat, and a funny book to read on the way home."  And I listened, and I got myself together.  I never flunked any courses, but I was getting like C's and things like that.  I went from making C's to the Honor Roll.  And he told me, he said, "You're sitting out there on that front lawn; I see you all the time."  And, and, and, my niece is in college now down at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia].  She said, "Did he really tell you..." I said, "Yes."  I--
Speaker 2: Well, tell us about the fellow you fell in love with.
Speaker 1: Oh, his name was Aaron Smith, and he played football, and we dated for a couple of years.  And he was from Pennsylvania, really a very nice guy, very nice guy.  And I was just head over heels in love, you know.  And, and, he ended up dropping out of school, because his family was also very poor, and they didn't have the money.  So he ended up dropping out of school, going back to Pennsylvania, and obviously, we drifted apart.
Story_ID: 111477
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: Can you tell us a little bit about when you got to Virginia State [University, Petersburg, Virginia], did it matter that you were poor?  Did you feel like you were fitting in okay?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: What were the--
Speaker 1: Well, it wasn't--well, you know, I guess my focus was on getting an education.  And I knew I didn't have things like the other kids had.  But let me give you an example.  I had a coat that was so raggedy, I was holding it together with safety pins.  And I remember we went to somebody's house and we hung our coats up.  And when we got ready to get them and leave, they were giving the coats out, and I didn't want to acknowledge my coat.  And finally somebody said, "Well, whose old raggedy coat is this?"  And I had to acknowledge that it was mine.  And I remember I walked home, and I cried all the way home.  When I say home, I meant to the dorm.  And, and, I was so hurt.  And I also remember going to my home, and I saw three coats.  I said, oh, my mother [Josephine Calloway Austin] bought me a new coat.  But the coats weren't for me.  The coats were for Mariann [Biscoff].  And I remember how crushed I was.  And I said, "Why three coats?"  And I don't think she meant to hurt me, but she wasn't thinking.  The coats were for Mariann, and I'm thinking here I am wearing this coat and it's so raggedy.  I've got the lining and everything and the hem all pinned up, and I'd sewn it up as much as I could.  And again, it was going back to--her way of trying to make a difference with Mariann was to give her things, and to do things.  She thought I was okay.  And, and, and, it wasn't until we had this conversation that I told you about, that she realized, you know, how observant I was and how hurt I was.  And, and, and, I remember the other girls, and how nice they were and, you know, their hair looked so nice, and their shoes and things.  And, and, I think I had like one, maybe two pairs of shoes.  I think I had a pair of flats and a pair of heels I could wear if I went to church or somewhere, and my homemade hand-me-downs, you know, and stuff like that.  But I, I, and then there were other kids that were like that, too, you know.  And I said my focus is on, my focus has to be on getting an education.  You know, you've got a chance; don't blow it.  And they were shipping kids out.  I mean, Virginia State didn't mess around.  You know, you flunked out, you were gone.  And you could come back, but you didn't stay, you know.  And I remember my professors talking to me, and my professors telling me, "It's not what you wear that's important, it's what you do."  And, and, and, I had this teacher named Miss Munden, Ella Munden [ph.].  Miss Ella Munden was always lecturing to us about the importance of getting a good education, and the importance of reaching back and helping people in the community.  "And you've got a chance that a lot of other kids don't have."  She was always--and, you know, it's interesting how that stuff sticks.  And so, you know, I was into a lot of stuff in college.  But I did okay.  I graduated and came up here [Washington, D.C.].
Story_ID: 111478
Speaker 1: One thing we didn't talk about, that I'd like to go back and talk about, is your family's experiences in church.  Did your family go to church growing up?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: Diamond Hill Baptist Church [Lynchburg, Virginia].
Speaker 1: What were your experiences like?
Speaker 2: My mother [Josephine Calloway Austin] wasn't able to go to church a lot, because she worked on Sundays.  And, you know, it was interesting, because we never spent Christmas with my mother, because my mother had to work on Christmas Day.  And what we would do is Christmas night, we would open up at least present with Mama, and then the next day we would open the other presents.  And then when Ann and I got big enough to work outside the home, we would go with Mama to work to help her, so that we could get home early so we would have at least part of Christmas Day together.  And to this day, to this day when we go home, we open up a Christmas present the night before Christmas.  But we grew up in a--Mama is a religious person, and we grew up and attended Diamond Hill Baptist Church.  But Mama wasn't able to go to church all the time, but we had to go to church; she made sure we went to church.  And we were in, I was like in the junior choir, and very active in Sunday School and things like that in church.  And when I went to college, you know, I continued to be, and still am very active in the church.  And my mother, it's interesting, my mother re-joined the church about three years ago.  And I went home to be with her to re-join the church.  And, and, and, she's--you know, I think what happened is she got into the habit of working all the time.  So, she just wasn't going to church like she should have been going.  But she never gave up on God, you know.  And yeah, we went to Lynchburg at Diamond Hill Baptist Church.  Reverend [W.J.] Hodge was my pastor, yeah.
Story_ID: 111479
Speaker 1: All right, thank you, Dean Futrell.  Now, what year did you graduate from Virginia State [University, Petersburg, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-two [1962].
Speaker 1: And you got your degree in business?
Speaker 2: Business education, right.  And I did my student teaching up here in Alexandria, Virginia.  At that time, they sent you as far away from the campus as they could.  And I did my student teaching at Alexandria, Virginia.  And, but when I started teaching, as I said, the schools were segregated.  I lived in [Washington] D.C. up on Longfellow Street, and commuted, caught a ride with another teacher going back and forth.  And I was, and I taught at Parker-Gray [High School, Alexandria, Virginia] for two years.  And then they desegregated the schools.
Speaker 1: Who taught where?
Speaker 2: At Parker-Gray.
Speaker 1: Parker-Gray?
Speaker 2: Parker-Gray High School.  And then they desegregated the schools, and I was one of the teachers.  And I didn't realize this until later; you know, it's fascinating.  They did not move all of the teachers.  They moved the vocational teachers, the health and physical ed teachers, some of librarians--one of the librarians--and a media teacher.  But they didn't move any of the teachers who were in the core academic courses.  They moved the teachers who were in like the vocational, or the other courses, over to the George Washington High School [Alexandria, Virginia].  And I went over there in 1965.  We had riots for about, oh, maybe five to seven years over at George Washington High School.
Speaker 1: When you say you had riots over this time period--I mean, riots at the beginning of every school year?  Or, how often--
Speaker 2: No, initially, there weren't riots.  But then the longer we were there, the riots came.  I remember one time they put, somebody put crosses up on the football field.  And before they could set them on fire, the police got there.  And then I remember one time we got to school, and people had painted racial epithets on all of the lower windows.  And they weren't able to get them off before the kids got there, and the kids started fighting.  And, and, I remember there was a period when the school--there was so much violence and so much rioting in the school, that we didn't know whether we were going to have school or not.  See--
Speaker 1: This is in 1965?
Speaker 2: In the 1960s.  And, and, and I can remember looking out my window, and you see the black kids on one side of the street, and the white kids on the other side of the street, and the policemen with the dogs trying to keep them apart.  I remember people, the Ku Klux Klan people came in and stuffed the lockers with hate literature.  And obviously what happened is when the kids went to open up their lockers, there was all this hate literature.  And what happened is, you know, kids thought the other kids did it.  And what we eventually found out is there were people coming in the school while the kids were in class, and they would put stuff in the locker.  And they would go to an area which was away from like the administration.  I remember one time, it was the first time we had a black girl selected for the Homecoming Queen.  Well, in the past--
Speaker 1: About what year was that?
Speaker 2: Probably late 1960s.  And in the past, the captain of the football team would be the one who would honor the Homecoming Queen, and he would give her a kiss on the face.  Well, the guy refused, because she was black.  Well, that Monday when we got to school, there were riots.  I mean, they set the school on fire, and everything happened.  You know, and it went on.  And when [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] got killed, we had riots for like weeks on end.  And then there was another incidence where a kid went into a store and the guy thought the kid was shoplifting, and shot the kid.
Speaker 1: A black kid?
Speaker 2: Yes.  But they discovered later the kid wasn't shoplifting, and he didn't have a weapon or anything.  Well, that started riots.  I mean, so for about five to seven years, I mean it was just--
Speaker 1: This was at George Washington High School?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And where is George Washington, where was it?
Speaker 2: In Alexandria, Virginia.
Speaker 1: It was in Alexandria.
Speaker 2: It's in the Mount Vernon area.  And they had three high schools.  They had some rioting at T.C. Williams [High School, Alexandria, Virginia], and a little bit over at [Francis C.] Hammond [High School, Alexandria, Virginia].  But most of it was at G.W. [George Washington High School], most of it was there.  And, and, that's where the rioting occurred.  And, but things finally calmed down, you know, things calmed down.  And, and, they made the school a junior high school [George Washington Middle School].
Story_ID: 111480
Speaker 1: Dean Futrell, one of the things I wanted to ask you about was with the desegregation and integration of George Washington High School [Alexandria, Virginia], was it gradual, or did it all happen--you know, did black students gradually come in? Or that particular year, in 1965, were there a lot of blacks--
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, Alexandria [Virginia] desegregated right after the Brown [v. Board of Education (1954)] decision, and they had what they called Freedom of Choice.  And so, about nine black kids applied to go to white schools, and they were basically elementary.  But it took about four years before they finally let them go.  And then that was in place until 1964, '65 [1965], and then they decided to desegregate the high schools, not the elementary schools.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The high schools.  And when they desegregated the high schools, most of the black kids went to G.W. [George Washington High School]. Some of them went to Hammond High School [Alexandria, Virginia], and they were in the process of buying a building, T.C. Williams [Alexandria, Virginia].  You've probably seen the movie, 'Remember the Titans,' that's T.C.  And so, then I can't--I think it must have been like in the late 1960s or early 1970s before they desegregated the elementary schools.
Speaker 1: But, so, the high school--so when George Washington High School was desegregated in 1965, there weren't just a handful of black students?
Speaker 2: No, and it was voluntary.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, the kids from Parker-Gray [High School, Alexandria, Virginia] had the right to decide whether they wanted to go to G.W. or go to one of the other high schools.  And most of the kids did decide to go.  Even though people tried to discourage them, they decided to go.  And then finally, they made Parker-Gray a junior high [Parker Gray Middle School].
Story_ID: 111481
Speaker 1: How were you received by white students and white parents, as an African American teacher?
Speaker 2: Um, (laughter), you really want to go through all of this?  Okay.  Um, I didn't have a lot of contact with the white parents.  The classes were pretty mixed, and I didn't have a lot of trouble with the students.  But I had teachers who wouldn't speak to me, they wouldn't talk to me.
Speaker 1: White colleagues?
Speaker 2: Right, they wouldn't talk to me.  And I remember saying to the assistant principal one time, she said, "How are you doing?"  I said, "I'm doing fine."  She said, "Any problems?"  I said, "Well, some of the teachers and some of the people won't speak to me."  And so she said, "Well, things will change."  You know, this is like early in my first year.  And a few months later she saw me again, and she was asking me, and I said, "Well, things are somewhat better, but there are still people who won't speak to me."  And she looked at me and she said, "Well, this is a democracy, and they don't have to talk to you."  And I said, "Okay, you're absolutely right."  I said, "But I'm not going to give up, you know.  I'm going to keep working until we get this right."  I had people who challenged whether or not I was qualified to teach.  And they would say things to me like, "Well, we assume that you know how to teach."  And I remember I said to my department chair one time, I said, "Well, I believe we were certified by the same department in the State of Virginia.  And so, if they certified you to teach and they certified me to teach, that means that both of us can teach the same subject."  See, I told you I was a smart-mouth.  The--eventually, you know, the teachers came around.  I was the first black person to be president of the local association and, you know, so that shows you how things changed.  Now, we went through a lot of sensitivity training in the system, but the sensitivity training did not occur until after all the violence occurred.  And, because the teachers never received it, and that was one of the things we talked about.  They had sensitivity training for the children because of the violence before they had sensitivity training for the teachers.  But one of the things that brought us together as a team, black and white, was the violence in the school.  We came together to protect the students and to try to save the school.  And I can remember blacks and whites coming together and planning and organizing--how are we going to monitor the halls?  How are we going to protect the cafeteria?  How are we going to make sure kids are safe?  And, and, it was interesting, because what was tearing the students apart was bringing us together.  But no, I--
Speaker 1: As faculty and as a staff?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  And, and, and, eventually, you know, things calmed down.
Story_ID: 111482
Speaker 1: And, and, and, my nickname as a teacher was "Mean 'ol Miss Hatwood" you know.  And the reason they called me that was because I was a very strict disciplinarian, and I held very high standards. Because what I discovered is if the students understood very clearly what you expected of them, you didn't have a lot of problems in your class.  And if you treated kids equitably and they knew you were going to try to help them, you didn't have a lot of problems.  The classes where there were problems, and oftentimes racial problems, were the classes where the kids felt they were being treated differently, and where there weren't clear standards, and where there wasn't good solid discipline.  And what I would tell my kids is, "When you walk across the door, you leave your problems outside.  We're going to deal with what's in here."  And, you know, as a matter of fact, I run into students now, and they say "You were tough."  But they also say, "We appreciated that."  And so, I was a lot like the teachers who taught me.  And I run into my students all the time, and they say, "If you hadn't insisted, we don't know where we would have been." You know.--
Story_ID: 111483
Speaker 1: And you decided to get your master's degree; you completed it in 1968?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  And I got my master's degree right here at G.W. [George Washington University, Washington, D.C.]  And I got it during the middle of the riots.
Speaker 1: That's what I wanted to ask you.  What was it like being here, going to school in Washington D.C. in 1968?
Speaker 2: Well, here at G.W., and one of the reasons I came back to earn my doctorate was because of the way the people treated me.  They treated me I thought very fairly.  They were very supportive and very encouraging.  But as I said, I didn't have a car.  See, I didn't get a car until I was about twenty-eight or twenty-nine.  So, what I would do, is the lady who would bring me back and forth--she would drop me off and then I would ride the bus.  And the classes were at night.  And I can remember, you know, G.W., this school, this university, doesn't shut down.  I can remember I would leave here at night, and I didn't know whether I was going to be able to get home or not, because you didn't know when the buses would run.  And I remember walking sometimes halfway home--and I lived up on Longfellow [Street, Washington, D.C.]--before a bus or a cab or something would come.  And we would be standing around trying to figure out, now how are we going to get home?  What's going to happen?  But, but, but, you know, they closed down the--well, you know they closed down the whole city, the whole area.  And I'm on the Alexandria [Virginia] side teaching [at George Washington High School], where the schools are open.  But on the D.C. side, things are shut down, and I lived in D.C.  So, what we would do, we would go all the way around Georgetown, and go up through Georgetown [Washington, D.C.] and through Rockville [Maryland], and we could get in.  Do you understand what I just said?  But the rest of the city was shut down.  But if we went through Georgetown, we could get in.  And so that's how I got back and forth.
Story_ID: 111484
Speaker 1: And just, what was the climate like in 1968?  What were you experiencing, and what were you feeling, you know, living here in the city [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: At the time of the riots and things?  I remember I used to, in about '68 [1968] I remember we were driving up 13th Street up near Cardozo.  And we saw all these people standing out in the street, and they had sticks and they had rocks and they had stuff.  And we didn't know what was going on.  And what they were doing was, they would go like this, and what they meant was cut your lights on.  And cutting the lights on meant that you were showing respect for the fact that [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was dead.  And, and, and, if you didn't, then they would throw rocks and hit your car with the sticks and things.  And I remember we didn't know what was happening, and I remember people passing and they would have their window open, "Cut your lights on, cut your lights on."  And I remember, I remember being in my neighborhood, and you'd walk out and the soldiers were patrolling all through the neighborhood.  The riots stopped on Kennedy Street, and I lived on Longfellow Street.  But when we went over to Kennedy where they had the stores and everything, they had been ripped apart, and I was one street over.  And, and, and, you know, you'd watch TV and they'd tell people to stay in, you know, keep your doors and things locked, and we did what we were supposed to do.  But they had police, they had the troops all over the place.  When you crossed the 14th Street Bridge, you know, they had the troops on the bridge.  And, and, basically what you had to do, was to do what you were told to do, and not get outside; just stay inside until things calmed down.  But it was very frightening.
Speaker 1: And was your mother [Josephine Calloway Austin] concerned about your safety?
Speaker 2: Yeah, everybody was.  You know, plus, see, I was the one who was the furthest away from home at that time.  And, and, they wanted me to come home.  And I said, "No," I said, "I'm okay."  I said, "As long as I do what they tell us to do, I'm okay."  And things calmed down, you know, and but they were worried, you know.
Story_ID: 111485
Speaker 1: And can you just kind of talk a little bit about some of the changes that you saw in students over, you know, over the nearly twenty years you were at George Washington High School [Alexandria, Virginia]?  What were some of the changes that you saw taking place, you know, just in the students and also in like the curriculum and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Well, I think one of the changes--
Speaker 1: Some of the biggest changes.
Speaker 2: One of the changes that I saw, and obviously in every class you've got children who don't try, or children who can't.  But I remember I would be teaching, and you would have students who you knew could do the work, and they wouldn't try.  And, and, I would sometimes talk to them.  And these were kids, who when they first came in, they were really trying, and all of a sudden they stopped.  And you talk to them on the sidelines about why.  And they were afraid that if they really put forth that effort, that they would be accused of acting white.  And I remember saying to a kid one time, "If somebody told you to jump off the top of a building, would you jump off?"  I said, "Then why are you not using your talent?  Why are you not using your ability?"  And he just hung his head and he didn't want to look at me, he didn't want to talk.  And I told him, I said, "You try, you keep doing your work.  Don't let..."  I said, "Because what you're doing now is going to shape your future."  And, and, and, what I would do, I would give up my lunch period.  I would give up my planning period to work with kids, and I would stay after school to help kids.  You know, a lot of my colleagues would laugh at me and tease me, "School is over at 3:30, 4:00, why are you here until 5:30 or 6:00?"  I said, "Because if the students need me and they need to have somebody to support them, I'm here."  I told my students, "If you need to come and talk to me, come and talk to me.  But when you come and talk with me, I want you to be able to demonstrate that you've tried your best.  And the best way to get beyond discrimination is to show what you can do, and do the best that you can.  Always do your best, and if you fail, it's not because you didn't try."  That was a big change, because, you know, we saw a lot of that.  When I looked at the curriculum, I think one of the big changes was trying to enculturate--as I said, most of sensitivity training, and trying to make sure the textbooks and things reflected the diversity.  We began to see more of the multi-culturalism as it related to what we were teaching in the schools.  You began to see minorities assume leadership positions.  Before when we came in--now, you got to remember--let me give you an example.  We had a coach who had won state championship football teams--football games, and we had one who won state championship basketball.  When they desegregated the schools, they made the guy who had been the basketball coach, the assistant to the track team.  And the one who had been the football champion, they told him he could be like the assistant to the freshman football team.  And he said, "I refuse."  He refused.  Now, as far as I know, no teachers were fired.  Now, I don't know whether there were teachers who said, "I'm not going to do this."  But as far as--
Speaker 1: In terms of desegregation--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --when they were moving to the other schools.
Speaker 2: Right.  But no one who had been a department chair was a department chair, okay.
Speaker 1: After desegregation?
Speaker 2: Right.  But by the time I left, see, I was a department chair.  I don't know whether I was the first.  I may have been the first at that school, but I'm not sure if I was the first in the city.  But I was a department chair.  And by the time I left, you had African Americans also teaching the core subjects--math, science, English, history.  And remember, when I first went there, it was just basically the vocational--the health and physical ed.  Those were the teachers who went over.  By the time I left, you had minorities in leadership roles at the administrative level, in counseling, and media.  The lady who had been the librarian at Parker-Gray [High School, Alexandria, Virginia] was made, like, the assistant librarian.  But by the time I left, she was the librarian.  And so, the changes were occurring.  And we worked together, as I said, to save the school and to try to make sure that the kids got a good education, but it took a while.  Some teachers left, because they didn't want to deal with it.  And, and, and, yes, there was a lot of violence, but a lot of us just said, "We're not going to give up.  We're not going to let these kids take over, and we're not going to let this kind of attitude, this kind of mood prevail."
Story_ID: 111486
Speaker 1: And what are some of your thoughts about desegregation, you know, fifty--we're looking at today fifty years after the Brown [v. Board of Education (1954)] decision.  What are some of your thoughts?  Because some have said that, you know, in black schools that it wasn't that unusual to have black teachers who had master's degrees--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and who were the very best teachers.  And what they did was take those black teachers who were the very best, and send them to white schools so that, you know, there was something lost there.  What are some of your thoughts?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all I think we did the right thing by desegregating the schools.  Because let's face it, as good as Dunbar [High School, Lynchburg, Virginia] was, we didn't have the resources that E.C. Glass [High School, Lynchburg, Virginia], which was the white school, had.  We didn't have the curricula offerings.  I remember we tried to get a French, and I believe it was German or something taught in the school.  We were teaching Latin and Spanish, and they said they didn't have the resources.  Then the next year we saw it at the other school.  We wanted to expand certain programs and have more facilities, but they didn't have the resources--all of a sudden it's over here.  One of the things people don't realize is--and I tried--and I wish sometimes I was back in the classroom.  One of the things that happened, about 42,000 African American teachers throughout the twenty-one southern states lost their jobs because of desegregation.  And you notice I didn't say because of Brown.  It was the implementation of desegregation, and about 42,000 teachers lost their jobs throughout the South.  A lot of people were demoted.  Administrators were demoted.  A lot of people quit because they didn't want to put up with it.  But 42--that's a lot.  And when I look at the teaching profession today, we're down to about ten percent minorities, with a student population that's about forty-five percent.  And we're never going to have forty-five percent minorities in the teaching profession.  So, part of what I think has to happen is you've got to make sure that all teachers coming in are capable and willing, and understand how to teach our children.  A lot of the schools were closed, the black schools were closed when they became junior high schools.  Dunbar is a junior high now, and part of the school was torn down.  Somebody was telling me that when they made the decision to convert it, a lot of the trophies and a lot of the things that we had won, were just thrown away.  You know, unfortunately, nobody knew that they were going to throw them away.  And so by the time they realized the stuff was gone--so a lot of that history, the memorabilia is gone.
Story_ID: 110619
Speaker 1: So, we were talking about, you were saying that, I think forty-two thousand [black] teachers lost their jobs.
Speaker 2: Lost their jobs.  And we were talking about what's different.  And I think, yes, when we were in school the teachers really pushed us, and the parents really pushed us, and the community really pushed us to get a good education.  What I see that's different now is that it's the "whatever" attitude kids have about education, and the "whatever" attitude kids have about school.  And they believe that if you are considered to be a nerd, that's really negative.  It's not new, it's always been like that.  But, it seems to be even worse today than it was.  And it's not just a black thing, you see it everywhere.  But it seems to be having a greater impact on black kids and sometimes poor kids.  And what I want to say to those kids is education is the way you escape all of this baggage, all of this discrimination, all of this poverty that you got out here.  But I also see different things.  You know, when we were growing up, as I said before, it was not just the teachers.  It was also your parents and your family and the neighbors--at least that's the way it was--and believing in yourself, and making you believe even more in what you could do.  And I thought I could, but if I hadn't had someone pushing me and holding me up, I probably wouldn't have continued to push, I would have given up.  But what I see today, is that that expanded family isn't there.  And not only isn't it there, where it is, the attitudes that people have about anybody else saying anything about their child exceeding, they consider that as interference.  And, and, and, and, when I was growing up, that wasn't interference.  You didn't talk back to your neighbors or the people in your church if they were inquiring about your grades, or how you were doing in school.  And, and, now it's almost like, you can't tell my child what to do, and it's my affair, and my affair only.  And when I see--sometimes people come up to the school, and the way they talk to the teachers and the way--you know, they don't really push the issue.  So, here's this "whatever" attitude.  And yes, you've got some teachers who don't really try, and they don't think certain kids can learn.  But it seems to be much more prevalent, much more obvious now than it seemingly was when I was growing up.  And even though I experienced some of those discriminatory factors when I was in school, most of the teachers believed I could, and they were the ones who pushed me.  And, and, even when I see teachers today trying to push the kids, it's like the peer pressure not to excel is dominant.  And, and, even so that the parents don't have as much influence.  The schools don't have as much influence, the church doesn't have as much influence.  And so I want to say, "Hey, you better wake up."  You know, if you don't give the kids the foundation now, what do you think is going to happen in fifteen, twenty years when they go out here and look for a job, and they can't get one, you know?  And so, that is a big change--the cultural--the atmosphere in the school.  But at the same time, I see now a push for--you've got to reach higher standards.  And so, the question is how do you help those kids believe and understand that they can?  And how do you push them to do that?
Story_ID: 110620
Speaker 1: In 1983, you became the president of the National Education Association.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Were you the first African American?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No, a lot of people think I am.  I was the first African American to serve as president of the Education Association of Alexandria [Virginia].  I was the first African American to serve as president of the Virginia Education Association.  I was the fourth minority to serve as the president of NEA.  There had been a Hispanic, an African American man, and an African American woman who served before me, and the Hispanic who was a male.  What was different about me, was I was the first person to serve more than four years; I served six years.  And, and, what they did is they extended the term.  I was supposed to serve four, and they extended the term so I could serve two more years, and I served six.  And that was what was different.  But I wasn't the first.  And by the way, about half of the presidents of NEA had been women, so I wasn't the first woman, either.
Speaker 1: And what were some of your accomplishments, you think, or some of the things you were most proud of as NEA president?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, I think one was the whole issue of diversity--placing more emphasis on diversity, getting more minorities and women.  When I say diversity, I'm talking about minorities and women involved in leadership roles in the organizations, more involved in coming to meetings and the representative assembly.  But also when you look at the board, when you look at the executive committee, when you look at the state presidents--more women and more minorities.  Another one was, you may have heard about the report, "A Nation at Risk."  Well, when that report first came out [in 1983], NEA was going to oppose it.  And I was one of the ones who said to NEA, you can't oppose this report.  Most of the stuff in here, we agree with it.  There are some things with which we don't agree, but most of it, we agree.  I consider that to be good leadership.  Another one where I'm really proud is when the whole concept of a national board, national certification [National Board for Professional Teaching Standards], was brought forth, the NEA was going to oppose it.  And I remember telling the NEA, if you oppose this, no one will ever believe that we're for equality again.  When we went into the representative assembly, the vote was like 80-20 against us supporting the national board, and thus, national certification.  The president is not allowed to debate.  So, the only place you can really express your opinion is when you give your speech.  And I remember going in, and the people were just crazy; they were going to oppose this.  And I remember that before the meeting, the Higher Ed people came to me, and they were leading the fight against the national certification process, because they thought they would have to go through the process as well, which was fascinating.  I said, "There's nothing in the report that says that Higher Ed has to go through this K-12."  And they said to me, "If you will say that in your speech, and if you will respond to questions from the floor, we will support you."  Well, what they did is, they wired the mic.  Every mic, they had it stacked.  And they would ask a question and then they would yield to somebody else.  And I had to say about three or four times that "No, this does not include Higher Ed.  This is for all teachers, this is voluntary, and we ought to be supportive."  Well, when they finished going back and forth--it was a heated debate--it was 70-34.  So, they turned it around.  And, and, to this--and it's funny.  The guy who just stepped down as president of the NEA, was one of the guys who opposed me.  And the guy who's now the executive director of the NEA--they told me about three years ago, they publicly stated that they were wrong, and that I was right.  That would be one of my accomplishments, would be getting the NEA to--my point to the NEA is don't always talk about what you oppose.  What do you support?  What do you advocate?  Talk about that.  And so that's basically what--I would say that, women, diversity, and getting the organization much more involved in international issues.  I would say placing more emphasis on teachers as leaders, and, and, and respecting the opinions and respecting the quality and the expertise that teachers bring to the table.  So, and also I think I would say another plus would be really pushing for all children to get a quality education, and believing in all children to get a quality education.
Story_ID: 110621
Speaker 1: And in 1992, you began teaching on the collegiate level--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --at George Washington University [Washington, D.C.].  How did that opportunity come about?
Speaker 2: Well, I had earned my master's degree here in the 1960s.  And, and, when I got ready to step down as president of the NEA [National Education Association], I didn't know what I wanted to do.  I knew I wanted to stay in education, but I wasn't sure I wanted to go back to the classroom.  I knew I didn't want to go into politics.  And people were talking about, "Well, go into some foundation."  And one of the faculty members here came and said, "Why don't you come back to school and get your doctorate?"  I had always promised I would never go back and get my doctorate; I didn't want to put up with that.  And I said, "Okay, well, that will give me time to think, and decide what I want to do."  And they made me a senior fellow, and I came back and earned my doctorate.  And when I finished, they said, "Well, we would like to invite you to be part of the faculty."  And so, I said, okay.  And I accepted the position as a member of the faculty in the Department of Educational Leadership and the Educational Policy Program.  And then I also created a center called the Center for Curriculum Standards and Technology, and I co-direct that with another faculty member.  And then in 1995, in '94 [1994] rather, the end of '94 [1994], the dean announced that he was leaving, and everybody was shocked.  And so, they invited me to be the dean.  And then I competed, and I was the interim dean.  And then I competed and they made me the dean, and I've been here since then.
Speaker 1: The dean of Graduate Studies at that time?
Speaker 2: At that time when I joined the faculty, it was just the School of Education.  But by the time I took over, it had become the Graduate School of Education and Human Development.
Story_ID: 110622
Speaker 1: And what have been some of your accomplishments and things you're proud of that you've accomplished here at GW [George Washington University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Well, I think one is obviously the quality of the faculty.  We have here, we've got, probably about fifty or sixty percent of the people are new.  I think that's one thing that--
Speaker 1: It's increased in diversity as well?
Speaker 2: We're trying to increase diversity, the quality of the students, improving the quality of the students.  A number of the programs have totally revamped the curriculum, and I think we've got stronger programs.  The fact that we are nationally ranked--I think the fact that we're the second smallest school on the campus, but we bring in the second or third highest amount of external research funds.  When I look at the reputation of the faculty, I'm very proud of that; I'm very proud of the hard work of this faculty.  And one of the things a lot of people don't know about G.W., is that when Brown [v. Board of Education (1954)] was handed down, this school was one of the first to lead desegregation, G.W.  And when I learned that, I was very surprised.  It was one of the first to bring in minority students.  And by the way, one of the ways that it happened was Virginia didn't want to provide terminal degrees for blacks in the State of Virginia.
Speaker 1: They didn't want to provide what kind?
Speaker 2: Terminal degrees, like B.S. B.A., M.A., so they sent them here, and G.W. took them.  So, G.W. was one of the first universities to educate African Americans in this area.  We were, this school was one of the first to employ African Americans as members of the faculty.  And so, when you look at the history of the school, it's quite impressive, you know.  And so, when I think about G.W., it's--
Story_ID: 110623
Speaker 1: As an educator, what are some of your thoughts about legislation enacted under the Bush administration, the No Child Left Behind policy?  What are some of your thoughts about that, as an educator?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, a lot of people have problems with the No Child Left Behind legislation.  But when you look back at the accountability movement, it is part--what I find fascinating is that the party that was opposed to federal legislation and education, is the party that has led the fight for federal legislation and education.  Remember, the Republicans opposed the Department of Education.  But when you go back and look at "A Nation at Risk," and you look at the National Education goals, and now you look at No Child Left Behind, those three national or federal pieces of legislation, or federal reports, have come under the Republican administration.  To me, education is not Republican or Democrat.  It's a common issue that we all have to address.  No Child Left Behind, a lot of people have come out and opposed it.  And I go back to what I said when I was president of the NEA [National Education Association].  Don't just tell me what you oppose, tell me what you support.  Are there some things in that legislation with which I do not agree?  Yes.  I don't agree with their definition of how to qualify, and especially when they talk about how to qualify and then they say, "All you have to do is pass a test and you can be a teacher."  It's a contradictory position.  I don't agree with the fact that they put this massive piece of legislation out here, and they haven't provided adequate funding.  They've left it up to the states.
Speaker 1: That's been one of the biggest--
Speaker 2: Right.  But there are some areas where I do agree.  The areas where I do agree is when you say no child will be left behind, and you say we're going to expose the scores of the children.  I agree with that, because it has forced education to bring out into the open something that we've been hiding for a long time.  You see, it's one thing to aggregate the data and to say, well, children are scoring in this percentile or this percentile, so we're doing a good job.  But to break it down and say well, these kids are making this score, but these kids are not--which points out you need to do a better job of educating the poor kids and the minority kids; you need to do a better job.  And What No Child Left Behind says is we're going to break it down.  We want to know by race--African American, white American, Hispanic American, Asian American, Native American.  We want to know by sex.  We want to know by poverty, we want to know.  And that puts it on the table.  So, the message is you have to educate all of these children.  Now, I don't think people understand what that means.  If everybody has to take the same test, doesn't that mean that we should basically have a core curriculum?  How can I evaluate you on something you've not studied?  That's not fair.  But if everybody is studying basically the same thing, then I ought to be able to assess you.  So, in that respect, I support No Child Left Behind.  But, again, you've got to train the teachers; you've got to make sure that they have the foundation.  You've got to understand, make sure they understand what the standards are.  You've got to change the curriculum, the content, to make sure all children are studying basically the same thing.  But does that mean that every child is going to study exactly the same thing on the same date?  No.  But it means if you're going to test for English literature, the kids have to study English literature.  If you're going to measure certain levels of math, they have to study those levels of math.  And so, from that respect, I can support it.  But it's the condition: Give the resources, work with the teachers, work with the district to make sure they have the training.  Make sure the schools in [Washington] D.C. have the quality teachers, they have the curriculum, and they have the resources they need.  Make sure the kids in the rural areas have the same thing.  That's what you got to do.

Speaker 1: What do you think are some of the biggest challenges facing educating the nation's children today?
Speaker 2: Well, one is, obviously, having enough highly certified teachers, and keeping those teachers.
Speaker 1: And actually, let me ask you.  What's your thought about the teacher shortage nationally?
Speaker 2: Well, it's more of a teacher retention issue than it is a teacher shortage issue.  It's how do we keep teachers?  How do we do a better job?  First of all, let's look at preparation.  We need to transform teacher preparation programs to do a better job of preparing teachers.  We also need to get rid of these alternative methods over here, where anybody who wants to be a teacher, if they pass a test they can teach.  We need people who are professionally trained.  We also need to change the conditions in the schools in order to attract and keep teachers.  It's not that we don't produce enough teachers; we can't keep them.  And when teachers say, "Why don't they stay?"  Salary is one of the issues.  But number one, the number one issue is the conditions in the school.  The number two issue is lack of support.  The number three issue is lack of respect.  The number four issue has to do with professional development.  And then number five is salary.  You combine all those together, and you're losing a lot of teachers.  And so, what I would say is we really need to look at transforming the teaching profession in the way we prepare teachers, the way we recruit them, the way we induct them, and retain them.  And that means you've got to look at the roles of teachers; you have to re-define how teachers function in the schools.  Another challenge is, America's student population is going to become more diverse, not less.  Translate that into America's future.  The people we have traditionally not educated well, we're going to have to educate well.  So, we need to change the schooling in this country to guarantee that all children will receive a good education.  That's curriculum, and that's teachers, and that's children working together.  I think that we need to look at issues related to what do children need to know and be able to do in order to survive in the 21st century?  It's very different from what we went through.  How do we help them to survive?  How do we focus on global issues, but at the same time also look at local issues?  And those are very important issues.  As we become more diverse, how do we become more unified?  And I think education has a critical role to play in that.  And I don't think people are paying enough attention to that.

Speaker 1: Dean Futrell, when you look back at your life, what stands out the most to you, and why?
Speaker 2: What stands out the most?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I think that what stands out the most to me would have to go back to the experiences I had with my family, and the fact that regardless of the fact that we were poor--and to a large degree most of the people in my family were not educated--we believed in education, and my mother [Josephine Calloway Austin] and my family insisted that we get a good education.  And it was not perceived as a chore; it was perceived as an enlightenment, something that would help you have a better life.  I remember my schools, I remember the teachers, I remember the community I grew up in, and how even though that community was poor, it was a community that looked out for each other and helped each other.  I look back and, you know, we've talked a lot.  We haven't talked about--I look at college.  I look at how the people at Virginia State [University, Petersburg, Virginia] are very similar to the people back in Lynchburg [Virginia], and they pushed us.  I remember that advisor who basically told me, "If you don't get in class and do what you're supposed to do, you're not going to be here."  And I think the other thing I remember is that I listened.  I listened to the advice that people gave me then, and the advice that people keep--continue to give me; I listen.

Speaker 1: And why do you think history is important, more particularly, African American history?
Speaker 2: I think that, to me, history gives you roots, gives you a foundation.  It helps you to understand from whence you have come.  You know, I didn't get to where I am by myself.  And history also helps you to understand that even though there are challenges, even though there are obstacles, you can overcome them--that there are opportunities you have to recognize and take advantage of.  When I think about history, I go back and I look, where did I get my strength?  Where did I get my identity?  Where did I get my source of who I am?  I got it from the history of my family, from the history of my community, from the history of my people, and the history of this country.  And if I didn't have the history, then what would be my model?  Or, what would I--well, when you look at history, history helps you to understand how people overcame things, and how they survived.  And when I look at history--and sometimes, you know, I've sat down and read about Frederick Douglass, and I've sat down and read about W. E. B. Du Bois and Abraham Lincoln and all, and I look at what they went through.  What kept them going?  What kept them aspiring to do better, in spite of how bad things was?  And I look and I go back and read the history of Lynchburg [Virginia].  And one of the things I found out not long ago, is the reason blacks got education in Lynchburg was because of the Quakers.  And the Quakers said, "If you don't provide education for them, we will educate them."  And the people didn't want the blacks educated as Quakers.  And okay, I didn't know that.  So, history gives you a sense of who you are, and where you come from.  But it also gives you a sense of where you can go.

Speaker 1: What advice do you have for people who may be interested in a career in education?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, I would say that you couldn't pick a better profession.  If you want to give back to the community, there's no profession better than teaching.  Is it tough?  Yes.  Are there great challenges?  Yes.  Are there times when you want to give up?  Yes.  But every time you think you want to give up, there's a child who made it, that you didn't think could make it.  And every time you think it's too tough, you find that there were obstacles even greater, and you can overcome, and you have overcome those obstacles and barriers.  And when I stop and I think about kids, hopefully, I've made a difference in their lives.  And I think about the way teachers made a difference in my life.  Are you going to get rich monetarily?  No, but you'll get rich because of the difference that you make in people's lives.  I would say become a teacher because of the talents and abilities you have, but also to give back.

Speaker 1: What have you not done yet that you'd still like to do?
Speaker 2: What have I not done yet that I would still like to do?  Take time to enjoy life.  I would like to, I never learned how to swim.  I would like to learn how to swim.  I never learned how to ride a bicycle; I would like to learn how to ride a bicycle.  I would like to spend more time just talking with my mother [Josephine Calloway Austin] about life, and her life.  What would I like to do?  I've never been to Egypt, I would like to go to Egypt.  I would like to continue learning, there's more to learn.  I'm always willing to learn, and I always want to learn.  What would I like to do?  I'd like to continue teaching people, because every class is different.  That's what I would like to do.
Speaker 1: Any regrets?
Speaker 2: No.  Well, I shouldn't say--I guess, I guess my one regret is I haven't taken more time to smell the roses.  That's, that's, you know... very busy, very busy, very busy.  But, but, but, no big regrets.  I mean, I've had opportunities.  I've had things happen I never dreamed would happen to me.  And so, I can't complain about my life.  I, I, I, as I said, probably the one complaint would be that I haven't taken more time to smell the roses.  But no, I mean, if you had asked me back when everybody called me--my nickname was "Skinny Minnie," "Bony Maronie," "The Hat," back when I was in high school, even college.  I would never dream that I would have done some of the things that I've done.  So, I don't have too many regrets.

Speaker 1: And how would you like to be remembered?  What is it you want people to say about you when you're no longer here?  What do you want them to say about Mary Futrell?
Speaker 2: I think I would like to be remembered as a person who cared about others and tried to reach out and help others; tried to make a difference in other people's lives.  I, I, I would like to be remembered as somebody who held herself to high standards and held those around her to high standards, including my students.  You know, a lot of people would look at that nickname, "Mean 'ol Miss Hatwood" and they would say that's a negative; I say it was a positive.  Because if by doing what I had to do by being strict and I helped somebody make it, then it's okay.  But I think the fact that I--hopefully, I reached back and helped people, not only in my family, but also the students I taught, the community of which I live.

Speaker 1: And what do you think your legacy will be?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know.  My legacy?  Oh, I guess, I hope my legacy is that she was somebody who cared about others, I hope.
Speaker 1: And perhaps your work in diversity and that kind of thing as well?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but... yeah.  I hope my legacy, part of it will be "always a teacher."  Whatever I did, I tried to be a teacher.  You know, when you talk about legacy, you know, I don't know if I want to reach back and say this, that, or the other.  But basically, hopefully I made a difference, and, and, and, if anything, the teaching.  And teaching isn't always what you do in a classroom, but teaching is also the way you live your life, the way you work with others.  And I hope I've been a teacher.

Speaker 1: And is there anything else you'd like to add that perhaps we didn't touch on?
Speaker 2: Well, we didn't touch on my husband.
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: Or my family.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Let's talk about--
Speaker 2: Well, I was married, and my husband's name was Donald [Futrell].  And I have two stepchildren, Chris and Kim.  And I have three grandchildren, Naomi, Joshua, and Benjamin.  And Chris works in Alexandria [Virginia], and Kim lives in Nigeria.
Speaker 1: What does she do in Nigeria?
Speaker 2: She's married.  Her husband is a Nigerian, so they live in Nigeria.  As a matter of fact, they just went back about three weeks ago.  And my husband and I are separated, but we still have a good relationship, and have two very nice kids and three very nice grandchildren, yeah.
Speaker 1: Anything else, Dean Futrell?
Speaker 2: Other than I love Skyler, and I love Joshua, and Naomi, and Benjamin, and my nephew, Eric.  Those are my hearts, yeah.  That's it.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: You're very welcome--
