Jessica Wilkerson: This is an interview on June 5th at the Southern Association for Women&#8217;s Historians Conference, and this is an interview with Keller H. Barron.
Keller Barron: 2009.
JW: It&#8217;s June 5th, 2009. Okay, so I want to first start by asking you when you first learned about feminism.
KB: That&#8217;s an interesting question because I really believe that, I don&#8217;t know whether I would call it consciousness-raising or not, but the use of the term &#8220;feminism&#8221;--. I had gone to a girl&#8217;s high school; I went to a woman&#8217;s college, but there wasn&#8217;t, in that period of time, a lot of discussion about what the word feminism, per se--. I remember going to a meeting that Jo Ruckleshouse was speaking. She was speaking to this meeting, and she got up and she said, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to start off by saying I am a feminist,&#8221; and I thought this is good, you know, and it&#8217;s okay to be a feminist. I guess that was during the period of time when I was beginning to work with the efforts for the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendments that there was a lot of discussion about feminism.
JW: So what year do you think that was?
KB: I think that would probably be in the seventies, early seventies possibly.
JW: So this is after you had graduated college and had started a family?
KB: Right, right, right. Well, I did read The Feminist Mystique, and I did have that click, as Sara Evans puts it, about how much her experiences mirrored, in lots of ways, my experiences. I wouldn&#8217;t call it conflict, but I would call it my concern about being a good wife and mother, and also satisfying some of my desires to have opportunities to express myself and think about things, and talk with other people. I was preparing my biography for this particular conference and when I was thinking about it, I said at that time that I had graduated in history and political science with an elementary teaching certificate, but that didn&#8217;t prepare me very well for teaching first grade with a class of forty-two children, or adapting to raising four children when the oldest was five. But what I found to help me through that process, not the teaching process but the raising of the children, was the League of Women Voters. The League of Women Voters became my grail, and I used that in my draft for the bio. I had looked up &#8220;grail&#8221; in Webster&#8217;s, and it said that the grail was a reward for Christian purity, and I thought now that fits because here I am having these lovely children, and then I have found this organization that helped me also to have opportunities to talk with other people and explore ideas and so forth, so the League of Women Voters really became very important in my life in this early time.
JW: Who introduced you to the League of Women Voters?
KB: I had a friend--I actually initiated a call after I had come to town, particularly looking at the AAUW, American Association of University Women, but I discovered that they were more interested in more social activities, and a lot of them were single people. Then I read in the paper and saw that the League was doing thing pertaining to government and learning about government, and I thought well, this will be important. So I called a woman named Gedelle Young, and she was delighted to hear that I was interested. So I said, &#8220;But I can&#8217;t come right now &#8216;cause I have these children.&#8221; So, as time passed, then she called me back and finally I said, &#8220;I tell you what; don&#8217;t call me; I&#8217;ll call you.&#8221; So I did, and I joined then in about 1956 or &#8217;57, when the children were still young, but it was early in my marriage and young adulthood.
JW: What do you think prepared you for your work in the Women&#8217;s Rights Movement?
KB: Well, you know, I&#8217;m interested that we&#8217;re talking in terms of women&#8217;s rights because the League of Women Voters, and that was more or less my orientation, saw itself, or sees itself as an organization for citizens. The terminology is always &#8216;citizens,&#8217; although it&#8217;s the League of Women Voters, but citizens&#8217; education and citizens&#8217; responsibility and so forth. So, I was not looking at it in terms, specifically, of women&#8217;s rights, and also as a woman and a girl, with the education that I had, we were not necessarily thinking either of women&#8217;s rights or girl&#8217;s rights because since it was single gender, there was no competition. It was always the expectation that you will have every opportunity and you&#8217;ll do the very best you can. So in my education and so forth of that nature, but then when I looked at, more specifically, I guess, in the effort with the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment when we did research, then we began to discover that the women in South Carolina and nationally, too, in many ways, but specifically in the state, did not have the same rights as men or boys. For example, we did a whole research effort on the differences in the laws to try to determine how the law would be affected because there were so many people that were so fearful that we wanted to allay those fears and say, &#8220;Well, now, some of these changes--. Our expectation was that those were going to be good things.&#8221; For example, in South Carolina, a girl could marry at fourteen, but a boy had to be sixteen. Well, on the face of it, that&#8217;s too young anyway, but the fact that there were differences, and there were other issues having to do with opportunities to join the service. Girls had to have permission from their parents; boys didn&#8217;t. That was a federal issue. So I guess that&#8217;s when I became more aware of the fact that women did not have the same rights. Also, when I married, I did have to sign away my dower rights, which was an interesting process. When my husband was going to buy some property, we had to go to the lawyer&#8217;s office, and I was taken in a room by myself. There was not to be anybody in there with me to influence me, and they were to tell me that if my husband was to buy this property, I would have to sign away my dower so that I couldn&#8217;t make any claim on it, you see. That then released the property so that they could get a mortgage or whatever, but that&#8217;s no longer the case. But dower rights had another issue. Some people thought that was a good idea that the woman had dower rights, but--.
JW: So did you think of that at the time when you were taken into the room?
KB: No, I didn&#8217;t, really, because that was just the way it is, you know. Then you reflect on it and you think well, now, I don&#8217;t understand that exactly. This panel that I&#8217;m going to be on suggests that I&#8217;m a veteran, and &#8216;veteran&#8217; sends a message to me of some militancy, a military veteran, but I&#8217;m not interpreting it that way. I&#8217;m a veteran in terms of age, because I don&#8217;t really--I didn&#8217;t see myself in a sense of militancy. There have only been a few times, and I can kind of remember one specifically, that I felt some real anger or some real effort. This is not chronological, but to give you this example, I was chairing the Greater Columbia Community Relations Council; I was the first woman to be asked to chair that. I had been on the council for a number of years, and as a part of that, I attended the Executive Committees of the Greater Columbia Chamber of Commerce. They were revising bylaws because they&#8217;d had so many people that were presidents and vice-presidents that were sent other places through the banks, primarily. So they said, &#8220;When we change bylaws, we&#8217;ll say, &#8216;When he leaves, he could do so-and-so-and-so.&#8217;&#8221; So someone made a motion. So I&#8217;m conscious now of the language; I&#8217;ve become sensitized to the language. So another person says, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll go along with that if you change that language. I&#8217;ve been in an insurance company in California, and we don&#8217;t say &#8216;he&#8217; anymore. You know, we say &#8216;chair&#8217; or &#8216;the person&#8217; or whatever.&#8221; This man across the way from me at the table, who was a business person, started laughing about that and making jokes about why this man would say this. You know, what is he trying to do to say this? So I really became somewhat incensed by that, and I looked right at him and I said, &#8220;You know, racist jokes aren&#8217;t funny any more, and sexist jokes are not funny any more.&#8221; So I felt rather militant in that, and then I was always very congratulatory to this man, Jack Hupp, for saying--for standing up for him. I said, &#8220;Jack, you did that and I didn&#8217;t have to.&#8221; It was hard, as women, to have to always be the one to be defending ourselves. It&#8217;s much better if the men could come in and they were sensitized, that they could defend it.
JW: Did you participate in civil rights organizations?
KB: When you think about what civil rights organizations, then we would wonder how do you define those particular organizations? I had a friend who was on the national board of League of Women Voters with me that moved to Hilton Head. She had always lived in New Canaan, Connecticut, and had been a member of NAACP. So when she moved to Hilton Head, she went to the NAACP meetings and they were the only white people there. So the experience in the North had been that the NAACP was more integrated. The experience when she came to the South was that it was all African-American. So I had never had any thought about being a part of, quote, the NAACP, if you consider that a civil rights organization. Then my other thought about that was that I had gone to a meeting where they sang &#8220;Lift Every Voice and Sing,&#8221; the Negro national anthem, and my friend, Dot Yaghjian who had grew up in the North, she sang the whole thing. She knew all the words. I had not even heard those--. I didn&#8217;t even know it. Never heard it, you see, as a Southerner. It turned out that she had worked with Joseph Lash with Eleanor Roosevelt, and that was a part of that movement. She&#8217;s older than I, but that was a part of that movement. I don&#8217;t know, I may be the wrong subject when you&#8217;re talking about women and civil rights, because when I look at my experience, I have had a lot of opportunities in many ways to proclaim or, I would want to use this modestly, to model the civil rights. Because through my work with the League of Women Voters, which was an accepted group, I was asked to serve by Governor West on the State Reorganization Commission; I was asked to serve on the State Human Affairs Commission, and had some opportunity in policy-making and opportunities for public speaking, where I could talk about things that we felt were important. Since I was acknowledged as being a &#8216;token woman&#8217;, in some situations I remember, particularly, being asked to work with the South Carolina Alcohol and Drug Organization, the state one, to look at women&#8217;s issues in alcohol and drugs. So we found that there were like, nine or ten residential beds, and the reason was that if a woman declared herself as an alcoholic, she risked the loss of her children. So, just finding that out and thinking about well, now how can we make the atmosphere so that these people can be treated?  Those are, in my view, issues of women&#8217;s rights and civil rights.
JW: How did your experience as a mother of four young children and as a teacher impact your involvement in the women&#8217;s rights movement?
KB: I only taught one year, because that was the time that my friends and people that I knew didn&#8217;t consider the necessity to work. It wasn&#8217;t a financial necessity; people lived within their means more. I&#8217;ve mentioned that to somebody else, and they say, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s not the situation any more because persons are not receiving a living wage; they&#8217;re not able to.&#8221; But I married in July, got pregnant in October, and taught through that year. So, that was the year that I had the forty-two children in the first grade. When I would have fifteen in a reading circle, I would have, you know, twenty-five in the back, so it was a management issue there, but I enjoyed it, and I didn&#8217;t go back because of my experience, but just because I became so busy with my family. So, what you&#8217;re asking me here is that experience and the experience of the children, and then what was the--?
JW: How that impacted your involvement in the women&#8217;s rights movement, how maybe it prepared you or influenced you later on.
KB: Well, I think the questions, for me, were the issue of--. Well, I&#8217;ll call it guilt. Is it okay for me to leave my children and go out to a meeting, or go out of town? So I was fortunate that I did have help in the house, and I was able, and my sister, on occasions, when I would leave, would come and help take care of the children. But it was a matter of trying to balance what I saw as my fulfillment or my opportunities or my responsibility because I did understand some of the issues, and I could articulate some of the issues. I remember when I was participating in the video for the IWY [International Women&#8217;s Year], the pro-ERA video, I commented that--. At one time, I said to my daughter whether or not I should do something or participate in something, and she said, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know why not; we do what we want to do; why shouldn&#8217;t you do what you want to do?&#8221; So I thought  well, now that&#8217;s true. I do encourage the children to do what they want to do, and so why shouldn&#8217;t I do what I want to do? So in some ways, that was permission. That was sort of okay, but I did have conflicts with that, and I understand other people have conflicts with it, and certainly, people that do work outside the home, and I was trying to always be sensitized and try to think about that, that mothers work inside the home as well as outside the home. My mother used to say to me on this volunteer work, you know, she&#8217;d say, &#8220;People get paid for what you do.&#8221; But I was not looking for it or looking at it in that way.
JW: So, did you feel like you found support from your sister who you said would come and help take care of the kids, or from your mother?
KB: And yet, you didn&#8217;t want to impose on them either, you know, but that was helpful. In many ways, I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to have done that, but I did have other people that felt that that was not--that I should not be doing it. It was interesting that--it seemed like it was okay to do some things and not okay to do others. It was okay to participate in the Daughters of the American Revolution national meeting in Washington, but it wasn&#8217;t okay to participate in the League of Women Voters national meeting in Washington, you know, so a lot depended on what you were doing. But as I reflect, I think this idea was one of the reasons why women&#8217;s church organizations developed, because it was okay if you were going to the church and work &#8216;cause you&#8217;re doing the Lord&#8217;s work, but it wasn&#8217;t okay if you maybe--and it was really okay, in many ways, to go play bridge all morning, or have a sewing circle or something. But it wasn&#8217;t necessarily okay to go and observe the City Council or something, you see. It just depended on your perspective of where you thought the woman was going to come down in terms of her policy, or she might be making trouble for other people or whatever.
JW: So who did--who do you think was not okay with your involvement in--or other people&#8217;s involvement with League of Women Voters? Where did you see the opposition coming from?
KB: I think there were, certainly, there were family members that felt that that was not okay. I don&#8217;t know, sometimes my picture was in the paper and I was on the TV and on the radio and different things, so some people say or have said that a southern woman only had her picture in the paper twice: once when she married, or name in the paper: once when she married and once when she died. So, it was not the role or the place of people to get publicity about themselves. However, there were other people that were glad if you were glad to be out front; they were glad. They were glad that you were out there. I remember we had a jewelry store that--a lovely old jewelry store that employed a lot of persons that were very genteel, aristocratic people, and it was okay if they had to work, they could work there. There was this lady, a little lady that would always come up to me very quietly, and she&#8217;d say, &#8220;Keep up the good work.&#8221; You know, &#8220;Keep up the good work,&#8221; and I felt I&#8217;m doing this for her, you know. Then I got letters from other people that would see my name in the paper or see something that I&#8217;d done, and they&#8217;d write me and they&#8217;d say, &#8220;You&#8217;re doing a great job. Keep up the good work.&#8221; So I thought  well, I&#8217;m willing to do that, and this, in many ways, made me feel good about it. I don&#8217;t mean to aggrandize myself in any way, but I&#8217;m just saying I do believe that there was a group of people that were willing to let me do it, where they themselves, for whatever reason, personality or what other constraints they might have, were not either able or willing to do it.
JW: So how did you deal with having this large family while becoming involved in the movement for women&#8217;s rights? You mentioned your sister; did you have support from your husband? What are other things that you thought helped you deal with it?
KB: Well, I certainly had the financial support because I was not working. I did go back to work in--. Not back to work, &#8216;cause I wouldn&#8217;t consider that one year really work, but in 1972, as we began the effort for the Equal Rights Amendment, the League of Women Voters and NOW paid me and paid Janet Wedlock with NOW, to work for the ratification. So, in 1972, my youngest child was twelve, and so I did start working then, for that. Then, after that effort, my older children were beginning to go to college. In 1977, I did go to work for a Community Care, which was an organization supported by churches, primarily the Methodist church, and I worked for the Emergency School Aid Act Grant. So that started my employment then, from then on from 1977. Well, actually, no, I&#8217;m getting it wrong. In &#8217;72, I went to work with ERA. In 1975, I went to work with Community Care, and worked there from &#8217;75 to &#8217;79. Then in &#8217;79, I went to work at the General Assembly with the research director for the Joint Legislative Committee on Aging, and I worked there from &#8217;79 to &#8217;97 at the legislature. So my work as a volunteer in government and the legislative issues, and the understanding of those issues helped me to both get the job at the General Assembly and then to enjoy it and carry it out. And when we&#8217;re talking about civil rights, I think with my work with the Joint Legislative Committee on Aging, we were looking at women&#8217;s issues having to do with aging, and the rights of the elderly.
JW: Can you talk a little bit about what your first experiences with the League of Women Voters was like?
KB: Well, at that time, the persons that were prominent people in the city, and I say prominent in that their husbands had jobs either in the city government or their husbands were physicians or lawyers or whatever, and they felt a sense of opportunity to serve. In some ways, it was social as well as it was a service organization. For example, we had a finance drive, and we would go out to businesses and ask them to support the League, because we did publications explaining ballot issues and things like that. So we&#8217;d go in pairs, and we&#8217;d dress up. You know, we&#8217;d have, I don&#8217;t think, necessarily, hats, but we had heels and dressed up. I went to this one person and talked with him about it, and he was interested and he said, &#8220;Well, yes, I&#8217;ll be glad to contribute.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Fine, I&#8217;ll just write you a check.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; So he wrote the check and I thanked him and went out, and he had made the check out to the &#8220;League of Women Boilers.&#8221; I thought who did we think we were, League of Women Boilers, and we had come in here all dressed up? But of course, we cashed the check, so that didn&#8217;t make any difference, so he really didn&#8217;t know much about us. It was the idea that we were boilers of some sort, whatever that was. So help me again now. What were we--?
JW: Just what your first experiences were like with the League?
KB: Right, so we were looking at fluoridation of the water, and my husband was a dentist, so he came and he testified about the fluoridation, and that was good to have his support in that, and the water was--you know, we did put fluoride in the water. We worked for women on juries, and that was certainly a women&#8217;s right issue. I&#8217;m thinking about that&#8217;s a very strong women&#8217;s rights issue. We had women on juries in state courts in the sixties, but we had not had women before, and we didn&#8217;t get women on juries in the state courts, I thought it was until &#8217;67. However, a gentleman yesterday said &#8217;68. But when you think about it, here you had women defendants that had an all-male jury, and of course, the same issues could be made with racial issues regarding the rights of the person being tried, but we did a lot of work about women on juries. The arguments against women on juries was that they ought not to be in the courtroom and be exposed to the language and the kind of conflict that you would have in the courtroom. Another issue was we have no way to accommodate the needs of women in courtrooms; we do not have any restrooms for women in the juries in the courthouses, which was totally untrue, because women were secretaries in other places. Those are the two that I remember of a more difficult nature, you know, that they wouldn&#8217;t understand, and so forth. But on the other hand, there were people that supported women on juries because the jury pool was relatively small. The jury pool was drawn from the list of registered voters, and what it meant was, some persons like doctors, lawyers; they could be excused. But the bulk of the persons having to serve on the juries were often persons who sold insurance or sold real estate (men), or who did other kind of construction work or so forth. They needed some more people in the pool so that they wouldn&#8217;t have to do it all the time, so in many ways, they were glad to have women in the pool. But it certainly made sense to have women on juries, and I bet a lot of people would not even realize that women didn&#8217;t serve on juries until the sixties.
JW: Did you get involved with the ERA work through the League of Women Voters?
KB: Yes, yes, yes, through the League of Women voters. I went to the national convention in 1972 in Atlanta. I was already on the national board. I had gone on the national board in &#8217;71, and in &#8217;72, Gloria Steinem came to the national convention in Atlanta. Her job was to get the League to support ratification in the states. The league had supported the ERA through Congress, but the league is and saw itself as a multi-issued organization, so they had not taken the strong support as some of the single-issue organizations had for it, and so that was her job. So she said to the people, &#8220;You call yourself the League of Women Voters, and you&#8217;re not supporting the efforts to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment? How can you not do that?&#8221; She is implying, you see, that we&#8217;re not, quote, feminists, but the bottom line came when she said, &#8220;Look at this stationery,&#8221; and she held up a league letterhead and said, &#8220;You&#8217;re using your husbands names.&#8221; And there it was: Mrs. Bruce B. Benson, Benson and everybody&#8217;s, Mrs. Sherrod L. Bumgardner. Lucy Benson later defended herself, not in the plannery, but she said, &#8220;Well, it may say &#8216;Mrs. Bruce B. Benson,&#8217; typed under my name, but I always sign it &#8216;Lucy Wilson Benson.&#8217;&#8221; But that called us up to say look, this is important and we need to do that. So, at that point, we began to get into it and looking at it, and when you looked at it, the unratified states were most of them in the South, starting from Louisiana all the way across, and Illinois, Indiana in the North, and the Mormon States. I think in &#8217;74, &#8217;75 there were like thirty-four or thirty-five states; we needed three or four more states to get to the thirty-eight, and South Carolina was one of them. In &#8217;72, it went right through the House 83-0, so it was unanimous of the persons that were present, so it looked like a possibility. I am more conscious now of what they call, or you call &#8220;identity&#8221; politics, and I&#8217;m thinking yes, I understand now why I was asked to do that: Because I was a southern woman who talked Southern; I was a Baptist; I had four children, little children. So, I&#8217;m saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid; I&#8217;m okay with it,&#8221; and &#8220;you can believe me,&#8221; and that was the idea, that I could influence other people that would support ratification and they would influence their legislators and we could get that done. So that was how I was asked to chair it.
JW: Now you mentioned in our phone call that you were concerned that your work on the ERA might pigeonhole--. If we just identified you as someone who worked on the ERA, that wouldn&#8217;t fully encompass your idea of women&#8217;s rights. Do you recall that conversation?
KB: Not really. [Laughter]
JW: Well, maybe we can get to it in different ways, because you mentioned your identity as a southern woman was supposed to help this national campaign for the ERA.
KB: Well, the campaign, specifically in South Carolina.
JW: So maybe one way of getting at that is, how do you think--? Well, how did you frame your ideas of women&#8217;s rights to southern men, or how did you turn to argue for it in the South, and perhaps separate yourself a bit from the way other feminists were being captured nationally?
KB: Well, I learned from Janet Wedlock, who was with NOW too, in terms of strategies, and the more extreme women, and I&#8217;m learning more about that even now, about what was going on with women&#8217;s liberation because I was not aware of all that in the sixties. I was busy with all my little children. We didn&#8217;t get a lot of the national press. We didn&#8217;t know a lot about things that were going on, just like we didn&#8217;t know a lot in our press about what was happening with integration, some of the racial issues. But Janet always said, when we&#8217;d go to the Legislature, if there were persons that were more extremely dressed, or not dressed as &#8216;ladylike&#8217; or whatever, we&#8217;d just push them to the front, put them out front, and then that made us look good. Her idea there was, the way that the NAACP had worked with the Black Panthers, she said they pushed the Black Panthers out front, and then that made people fall back, thinking the NAACP looked good, you see, compared to the extremists. So that was the idea, that the extremists--we&#8217;d have the extremists out there, and then we would be the fallback. There was one particular woman, Irene Neuffer, who had taken the opposition side, and she didn&#8217;t dress up like we did [laughter]. We said if she had been on our side, we would have put her in the back. But we would debate her often; she&#8217;s very articulate. She would say, &#8220;We don&#8217;t need the ERA. I was in the Army and I was a captain, and my husband, Claude, was a sergeant. I didn&#8217;t need the ERA. I was a captain; Claude was a sergeant. We&#8217;d all say, &#8220;Poor Claude.&#8221; [Laughter] Our thought was to try to say to the people don&#8217;t be afraid of this; we&#8217;re not afraid of it, and we would try to give reason to arguments. We approached everything from a very reasonable standpoint or we tried to. We thought, and I still believe that the arguments that we made to try to combat the fear were true. I think, unfortunately, we got into a defensive position; we were reacting rather than pro-acting. Things had gone along well, and then Phyllis Schlafly was able to galvanize the forces, so then we began to react to her rather than to be proactive. On the other hand, there were other circumstances. Thomas Emerson, well-known constitutional lawyer at Yale, had written a treatise about why we should support the ERA. One of his students, or colleagues, George (38:10), that taught at our school of law, was opposed to it. So, we knew George and Kay Haimbaugh.  She was a member of the League of Women Voters, so we had gotten Tom Emerson to come to town, and we said, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll call the Haimbaughs and say, &#8216;Would y&#8217;all like to have him over for a little cocktail before we go?&#8217;&#8221; They said, &#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; they&#8217;d have him over, and we&#8217;re thinking oh yes, Tom Emerson is going to go there and talk to George, and he&#8217;s going to convince George that he ought to be with us. Well, unfortunately, it didn&#8217;t happen. But we had those kind of social interactions that helped our--what we thought it was going to help our cause more than it did.
JW: What was your reaction and what are your thoughts about the failure of the ERA to pass?
KB: Right. I really think I just kind of got--. I was so convinced that we were right and that it was going to happen that after it didn&#8217;t happen, I really feel like I became disillusioned by it all. We had the situation at the Citadel, for example, where we didn&#8217;t have any women that were allowed to go to the Citadel. We know that the military service, for many people, is an opportunity for upward mobility, and yet, women were prevented from being trained so that they could go in as officers. Our state dollars, our taxpayer dollars, were going to support this military school and yet, half the population, the women, couldn&#8217;t go. So, in my view, to a logical thinking person, this is not fair; this is not right, and then, when the first young woman that went there, she was only there two weeks. Many of the freshmen as they&#8217;d go in are not able to physically endure the physical things that they have to do and do end up in the infirmary. She ended up in the infirmary and she never got out. There were a lot in her class that ended up in the infirmary. All the men got out, but she didn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m convinced that they may have been purposefully not helping her to recover, but that&#8217;s certainly just an assumption. So I really was very--. I was concerned about it, and in some ways, I guess I didn&#8217;t continue to push forward in some of that.
JW: Do you see continuity between your work on the ERA and the League of Women Voters and women&#8217;s rights and other positions that you held, for instance, on the Committee on Aging?
KB: And I do. I do, and the opportunity that I had in terms of consciousness-raising or sensitivity in other meetings and other groups that I&#8217;ve been in. I was active with the Christian Action Council, and I think the persons at the Christian Action Council were looking to protect and work with vulnerable people in lots of ways. I had some legitimacy as active Baptist person, and in quoting Galatians 3:28, which is the Bible verse that says that there is neither slave nor freed Jew nor Greek, male nor female. In Christ Jesus we&#8217;re all one. The idea that as a Christian person I believe that; still do. In reading Sara Evans&#8217; book, &#8220;Tidal Wave,&#8221; and this idea of consciousness and consciousness-raising, and explanations and how I think it was there that she was talking about some person and realized she was a little bit different. In thinking about our interview, I thought about when I was at camp, and it was right after the war had started in &#8217;41, &#8217;42, and we were in our cabin, &#8216;Old Glory,&#8217; and we had little night prayers. It was a YWCA camp, and I prayed for Hitler, and everybody was just--couldn&#8217;t believe it. You know, the counselor, &#8220;You&#8217;re praying for Hitler?&#8221; I thought well now, I guess I am different because it says you&#8217;re supposed to love your enemies, and we&#8217;re mad at Hitler, and so I prayed for Hitler. So that was one of those times that I thought well, maybe I am different that I&#8217;m thinking about that and other ideas just like supporting the ERA. Maybe I am different because I support that. That was why, when I found the league and I found other persons in other organizations or groups that it said it is okay. You know, you are okay; it&#8217;s all right to think that way, so I found more people that think like I do, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m enjoying here at this conference. The scholarship and the research, and it&#8217;s mostly all women, so this is good.
JW: You&#8217;ve mentioned the intersection with religious groups and your work with women&#8217;s rights, and I wonder if--you seem to have found great strength in your religious beliefs to help you with this work, but I wonder also if you have found conflict or contentions there and how you dealt with those.
KB: Yes, yes, yes. I&#8217;m now an elder in the Presbyterian Church. My second husband, after my husband died, the man that I married now is a Presbyterian, and I had gone to Presbyterian schools, however, after my husband died, I took a short, five-year turn at the Unitarian Fellowship. Enjoyed that a lot. But, I have had conflict there in terms of action. I get real frustrated about some of that, in terms of what our mission is and what we ought to be doing. Sometimes I feel like I need to withdraw because it makes me upset that I get upset, that these people can&#8217;t seem to do something, and don&#8217;t understand that that&#8217;s what their job is, is to try to do something. So I&#8217;m still on that struggle.
JW: How did feminism impact how you approached your later work?
KB: Well, you know, I don&#8217;t think that I necessarily have seen it specifically as feminism as we define it, the opportunity for equal rights or, you know, within the law, but now we&#8217;re talking more about personal politics, and I understand that. But I like to think that we&#8217;re looking out or trying to look out for the rights of all people. My later work last year, the League of Women Voters did a study of immigration, and so I chaired the local study, and we also have some friends, a family of Mexican people that we&#8217;re working with and I&#8217;m aware of the issues related with them. I also had mentioned earlier, the film, &#8220;A Simple Matter of Justice,&#8221; and in that film, it ends with a discussion with Betty Friedan, and she&#8217;s saying that she had talked with her daughter. Her daughter was in med school, and she says, &#8220;My daughter is in med school, and I&#8217;m saying to my daughter, &#8216;We need your help as a feminist,&#8217; you know, and she said, &#8216;Well, I&#8217;m not a feminist; I&#8217;m a humanist.&#8217;&#8221; Betty Friedan says, &#8220;Well, how do you think you got in med school? These people were working for you to give you these opportunities.&#8221; Then it closes; the final words are Betty Friedan saying, &#8220;Pay your dues. [Pause] &#8220;Pay your dues. Pay your dues.&#8221; So, we&#8217;re looking at women and the persons that have gone before that have helped them to get where they are, and now it&#8217;s just an amazement when you think about and you see the opportunities that women have had.
Even though South Carolina at this present moment does not have any women in our state senate, we have two women; we just elected a second woman to our state supreme court. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is Jean Toal, who was a graduate of my college as well, Agnes Scott College. Yesterday, when they had a program about her, they said Jean, as a typical southern girl, went to a southern school, and then she went to the University of South Carolina Law. I went up to the person afterwards and I said, &#8220;Could you possibly say that she went to Agnes Scott College?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Oh, well, I said it in the written paper.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes, but we want you to say it when you speak it out.&#8221; I mean, Agnes Scott is a small school. It is all women, and we need publicity about the importance and what single-sex can do to support women in their quest for fulfillment. [Interruption as an alarm sounds] Oh, I didn&#8217;t say anything about the fact that I chaired the South Carolina Committee for the US Commission on Civil Rights. That sounds good, doesn&#8217;t it?
JW: It does sound good.
KB: [Laughter] And I was the first woman chair on that. I did that from May of 1977 to April of &#8217;79.
JW: How did you come to be involved in that career?
KB: I was asked to be on the committee, and then later asked to be chair. Of course, there we were looking at civil rights for everybody, and particularly, we were looking at rights for black people. One of the major studies that we did was the small town of Mullins and how they had put in the water lines. They put the water lines down through the white area of town, and they didn&#8217;t put the water lines down through the black area of town. Then later, the same senator that was representing that small town, then I went to work at the State House and had to look at him every day, when we had published this report about what was happening in Mullins, South Carolina. That was an interesting time, and there again, that was when the commission was looking to have more women representing them, and I had that opportunity.
JW: Well, one last question from me, and then I&#8217;ll open it up to you and let you talk about anything you want. How has your idea of women&#8217;s rights changed over time?
KB: I&#8217;ve become more aware of how women have been--and I guess you&#8217;d have to say suppressed, or oppressed. I think about my mother; she, as a single woman, she sold insurance for a very short time, but she sold the most insurance of any woman in the state of Georgia. Penn Mutual Insurance, and she got a pin, a little pin. It had a place of great prominence on this little secretary. And that little pin, and we were so proud of that pin that Mother had won, but then Mother never had any other opportunities to do anything to work of that nature. In many ways, I think she might have been a happier person if she had been able to have success. Later, when she came to Columbia, she was a volunteer with the Red Cross, and she solicited people to give blood and she was wonderful at it. They just said, &#8220;Oh, she just does a grand job. If she would call for the man and he was not in, then she would talk the secretary into doing it.&#8221; I thought you know, she probably had a lot of talent in some of those kinds of things.
JW: Are there any questions that you thought I would ask that I didn&#8217;t ask that you would like to comment on?
KB: [Laughter] No, I don&#8217;t know. You know, one of the reasons that I have done a lot of the things that I have done is that I like it. I like people. I like going to meetings. There&#8217;s some people that say, &#8220;What did you do yesterday? You stayed in meetings all day?&#8221; It was wonderful; I just loved it. I believe that I can organize things. I can see the big picture, and I&#8217;m detail-oriented, so a lot of the things that I&#8217;ve done are--and I can manage to do a lot of things at one time &#8216;cause I did organize the children. When I&#8217;d go out of town, I&#8217;d do the menus and I&#8217;d have the carpools. I had eleven carpools at one time but I was able to organize those things. Now, some of the things that I&#8217;ve been doing since I retired, that was part of my thought. You know, I retired in &#8217;97. I&#8217;ve been retired twelve years; what have I been doing? Well, one of the things that we&#8217;ve enjoyed doing is we&#8217;ve worked with the Columbia Council for Internationals, and we&#8217;ve been host families for some people coming to Carolina. We&#8217;ve had some wonderful families and we&#8217;re now working with a Chinese family, and we helped her have her baby. We helped her, again you&#8217;re talking about women&#8217;s issues, helped her to get the kind of care that she needed. We were her advocates and she needed us, not just because she couldn&#8217;t speak English, but because she was a woman. If she hadn&#8217;t spoken up, or someone spoken up for her, she wouldn&#8217;t have gotten the type of care that she needed. We also have a Mexican family that we&#8217;re working with, so the opportunities that we&#8217;ve had because we know people and we understand what their rights are, and we help them to get those rights. Well, it will be interesting when you compare what we&#8217;ve talked about and you compare with some of these other people, and it may be that--. I don&#8217;t, like I&#8217;m saying, I don&#8217;t know what these other people are going to say, but when I was preparing my bio, I used a model that one of the other persons you&#8217;re interviewing later used, and I&#8217;d told the person I was sending it to that I liked it, so I wrote it like that. When I looked at these last twelve years, I thought well, what have I been doing? So I put on there, on my bio, I put on that I had just returned from Istanbul and belly-dancing, so I have been traveling a lot. But unfortunately, in a way, the person that edited my biography took that out, so I would like to say when I talk about what have I been doing, hopefully, I&#8217;m having an opportunity to help these people that we&#8217;ve met. But also, I&#8217;m enjoying life and I&#8217;ve decided that when I have these opportunities to go places and do things, I&#8217;m going to do them.
JW: Well, thank you, Keller. I&#8217;ve very much appreciated it.
KB: You&#8217;re welcome. [Laughter] Okay.
