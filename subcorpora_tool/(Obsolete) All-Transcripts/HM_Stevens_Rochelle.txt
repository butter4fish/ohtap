Story_ID: 290805
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [John Holloway] side of the family.  But I'm going to ask about your mother's side first--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --so we don't get them mixed up.  So, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Its Beatrice, B-E-A-T-R-I-C-E, Holloway, H-O-L-L-O-W-A-Y, Beatrice Holloway.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And no middle name for her either?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is April 11, 1946, Arlington, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay, A-R-L-I-N-G?
Speaker 2: T-O-N, Arlington, like Arlington, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how far back can you trace your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Not real far, just her mother and my grandmother's mother, who had missed slavery by two years before the freedom.
Speaker 1: So, this is your great-grandmother?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what's her name?
Speaker 2: Bell Stevens.
Speaker 1: Okay.  B-E-L-L (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  So, my grandmother was named after my great-grandmother, B-E-L-L, Bell.
Speaker 1: And her last name is Stevens?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's Stevens (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  My mother's maiden name was Stevens, and her married name was Holloway.
Speaker 1: Oh, your mother's maiden name was Stevens, okay, all right.  And she was born, do you know the year she was born?
Speaker 2: The great-grandmother, or my grandmother?
Speaker 1: Your great-grandmother.
Speaker 2: Hmm, I kind of forgot that part.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was in the 1800s though.
Speaker 1: And you said she missed slavery by two years?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, the Emancipation Proclamation was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ninety-eight [1898]--
Speaker 1: Well, slavery ended officially in 1865.  So, 1863.
Speaker 2: She was somewhere around that way.
Speaker 1: Or 1860--she missed it by two years.  Then she--well, 1867 then, yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Two years after slavery, 1867 or thereabouts.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And her name was Bell Stevens?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  Are there any stories about her that have been passed down?
Speaker 2: Other than she was real pretty, and she was elegant and had a lot of class, and she was quiet and meek.  And a lot of her characteristics passed down to one of her daughters which were a part of nine children or ten children which was--she was named after her as well--Bell, B-E-L-L, Bell Stevens.
Speaker 1: So that's your grandmother's name, too?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  For a long time she thought her name was Willola [ph.].  And we later had to get a birth certificate on her, and we found out that Willola was her nickname.  And for maybe sixty-something years we knew her as Willola, and we found out that her name was really Bell, Bell Stevens.  And so, my grandmother was born like in 1926 or something.
Speaker 1: Nineteen twenty-six [1926], okay.  Well, probably her mother was born a lot closer to the turn of the century than 1867, I think.  But is there a, you said there's a story about one of her ancestors being born right after slavery?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, were there any other stories about them, I mean, from those days that they passed down, about what life was like?
Speaker 2: Other than it was just hard, and they were poor.  But they were really classy.  My grandmother was, she was elegant as well, and real meek and humble.  She didn't say a whole lot.  And when she started getting older, she refused to walk bent over or walk with bent knees.  She was like, "Oh, that's how the old people walk.  I don't want to walk like the old people."  And so, she was determined to just have that elegance about her throughout her entire life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now they were all--as far as you know, the family's roots are still--I mean as far back--in terms of a place, it's still Arlington--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Tennessee?  There's no stories about them being from any other place?
Speaker 2: No, not that I know of.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, did you know your grandfather at all?
Speaker 2: My grandfather was Clyde Stevens.  And he didn't stay with my grandmother very long, but we still knew of him.  And when we got a little bit older, we started going out to Arlington or Mason, Tennessee to visit him.  But I didn't really know my grandfather.  I just knew his name, and he definitely knew my name.
Story_ID: 290806
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Beatrice Stevens Holloway] grow up in Arlington [Tennessee], or did they move to Memphis [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: They moved to Memphis upon, like, graduation.  So her siblings, some of them were still in high school, and they attended Douglass High School in Memphis.  But my mother finished Barrett Chapel High School [Arlington, Tennessee], B-A-R-R-E-T-T, Barrett Chapel.
Speaker 1: That's here in Memphis?
Speaker 2: No, it's in Arlington.
Speaker 1: In Arlington, okay.
Speaker 2: Or Mason, Tennessee [sic. Arlington, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Mason, Tennessee, okay.  So, they came up when she was a teenager, just finishing high school?
Speaker 2: She was finishing high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this would be about nineteen sixty--
Speaker 2: Four [1964].
Speaker 1: Four [1964], okay.
Speaker 2: Or three [1963]
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your mother have a chance to go to college?
Speaker 2: My mother was recruited to attend college, but actually she wanted to go to the [U.S.] Air Force.  And at that time, you pretty much listened to your parents, so she ended up going up to New York [New York] to get a job, which were the wishes of my grandmother [Bell Stevens].  But she really wanted to attend college, because my mother was a state champion in the 4 x 100 meter relay, and she was a finalist in the 100 [meter race] and the broad jump.  But my grandmother didn't want her to attend college.  My grandmother, I think highest education level was probably second grade.  And in the '60s [1960s] at that time, for some people, if you finished high school that was a major accomplishment.  But my mother ended up going to New York to work a job.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was she disappointed because of that?
Speaker 2: My mother, yes, she still talks about that, that she really wanted to go to college and then go to the Air Force or some form of military, because that was something she wanted to do, and then eventually coach, be a PE [physical education] teacher and coach.  So, I told her that you didn't get the opportunity to go to college, but guess what?  You ended being a world class coach, and you trained your athletes to Olympic medals, world championship medals.  And I think that is a greater accomplishment than just being a good old PE teacher, teaching young people about fitness and health and wellness at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, did your mother talk about how she got involved in sports?
Speaker 2: She was just always athletic.  My mother, she played basketball, she played softball.  She also ran track.  My mother was on the honor society, she graduated with honors.  Also, she was on the rifle team, which I didn't know that she was on the rifle team.  So, she was very active when she was in school.  And in fact, this weekend they're celebrating their class reunion.  They had like fifty-seven people to graduate from Barrett Chapel.  And they have a large number coming back, and the rest are deceased.  But they have almost 100 percent participation of their classmates coming to Memphis this weekend to celebrate.
Story_ID: 290807
Speaker 1: Let me move to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Its John, J-O-H-N, Ollie, O-L-L-I-E, Holloway.  And he, too, was from Arlington, Tennessee.  He graduated from their [Barrett Chapel High School, Arlington, Tennessee] rivalry school, Woodstock, Woodstock High School [sic. Shelby County Training School; Woodstock Middle School, Millington, Tennessee].  And he came from a large number of siblings as well.
Speaker 1: Is Woodstock High School in Mason [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: It's like, Arlington [sic. Millington, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: In Arlington, so now--
Speaker 2: Kind of down the street--I think they started making it a little bit closer to Memphis [Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But my--
Speaker 1: And what year was he born in?
Speaker 2: He was September 4th, '43 [1943], 1943.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Is there much information about your ancestors on your father's side?  How far back can you go?
Speaker 2: Not a whole lot.  My father was drafted to go to Vietnam War.  So, he basically had gotten my mother [Beatrice Stevens Holloway] pregnant and went to Vietnam.  And once he got back, they married.  And they never did pay to have my name changed, (laughter).  So, at that time when you had children out of wedlock, you used the mother's maiden name, unlike now. This generation uses the father name.  But I still have my mother's maiden name.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now, is there a story about how your parents met, that they tell?
Speaker 2: Not really.  They didn't, she didn't really have a whole lot of stories to tell.  Because when you get the news that you're being drafted to go to Vietnam, it's not a whole lot--you're just basically now praying and hoping that they will make it back from that war safely.  Because that's when they were getting you at sixteen and seventeen years old of age; you hadn't even lived your life yet.  And so, they didn't really get a chance to date very long.  But they were just happy that he survived the war, and it kind of just went from there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well, they met in high school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, they met in high school.
Speaker 2: And, all right, well now what did your father end up doing for a living?
Speaker 1: My father ended up working for Memphis Light, Gas and Water [(MLGW), Memphis, Tennessee], which is the electrical company here.  He was a mechanic.  He worked on all of the utility trucks that you would see that go out to repair the electrical problems here in the city.  And he ended up being one of the head supervisors, head mechanics over--the head supervisor over all of the mechanics at MLG&W, and that's where he ended up retiring.  He also has a gospel group which has been around since I can remember.  They're called the Southern Sons [of Memphis], like S-O-N-S, Southern Sons.  He's the lead singer, so he's the writer/producer for the Southern Sons, and they still are in existence.  In fact, they're about to celebrate their anniversary coming up in September of this year.
Speaker 2: So, what part does he sing?
Speaker 1: Well, he's the lead singer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And to me, my father sounds a lot like R. Kelly.  And he'll be like, "Yeah, right, I don't sound like R. Kelly."  But he's real meek and laid back like R. Kelly, to me (laughter).
Speaker 2: I hope he stays out of trouble (laughter).  R. Kelly can't avoid that.
Speaker 1: Well that's probably why he's not with my mother. He didn't stay out of trouble (laughter).
Speaker 2: So did they, they split up early?
Speaker 1: They split up after being together eight years.  And they said, whoever gets a divorce--I mean, whoever gets married first will pay for the divorce.  So that didn't come about until eighteen years later.  So, technically by paper they were married for a long time.  But the marriage lasted for eight years, and it ended up with four girls and no boys in their relationship.
Story_ID: 290808
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Beatrice Stevens Holloway] do for a living?
Speaker 2: My mother worked with the Memphis City Schools [Shelby County Schools] in the transportation department.  She worked with special education for fifteen years.  And because she dedicated her life to God and church and her four daughters, and didn't miss a PTA [Parent Teacher Association] meeting or basketball game or cheerleading or majorette competition, at an early age, we made a commitment that we would put our mother on children's support and take care of her.  So, we retired my mother before she was forty years old, and she has not worked since 1989.  So, we take care of our mother.
Speaker 1: You and your sisters?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 290809
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' [Beatrice Stevens Holloway and John Holloway] talents and their personalities, their dispositions even their looks--who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I have my father's build, because he's slender.  And I guess I got the height from somebody's grandparents.  Because my mother is only 5'4", and my father may be 5'7", and I'm pushing 5'8".  I believe I have a lot of my mother's characteristics, by being strong and a go-getter and aggressive.  And then of course, I got all of my mother's genes for athletics.  And my sisters said it stopped with me (laughter) because none of them wanted to participate in sports.  And then the musical background basically came from my father because I was inspired as a little girl listening to him singing and practicing in our home.  So I later became a music major, playing B flat clarinets, snare drums and bass guitar.  I did four years of band and three years of choir, first and second alto, and the head director of our gospel choir at Melrose High School [Memphis, Tennessee].  And I end up earning five musical scholarships on top of the twenty track scholarships as a high-schooler.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you took your musical talent after your father, and your athletic talent after your mother.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 290810
Speaker 1: Now, you've got four--three other sisters, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you--are you--you're the oldest--the youngest (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  I'm the oldest.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, can you name the other three, and where they rank in the order?
Speaker 2: Sharyn, S-H-A-R-Y-N, and her married name--so she's Sharyn Denise Ellison.  And she's been married like forever, since twenty-plus years.  And she's a mother of two, and she is, she was always very smart.  She was an honor student from elementary all the way through college.  And she has her master's degree, and she's a home engineer now.  So, that's her posit--take.  She's an AKA, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority.  She was the Sorority Sister of the Year in her chapter in Marietta, Georgia.  So, she's the only sister that does not live here in Memphis [Tennessee].  And then my other sister, her name was C-A-T-H-E-R-I-N-E, Catherine Lois.  And she was a Holloway.  Catherine, she died at the age of eighteen in 1989.  She was a freshman at Southern University [and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  She woke up paralyzed in college, and they later found out that she had a brain tumor that was too large to remove.  At first they thought she had a stroke in her sleep, a heart attack in her sleep, Bell's palsy.  And we later found out that it was a tumor from birth that was never detected, and she died a year later.  But she was at Southern University on an [U.S.] Air Force scholarship.  And she was a majorette in school, and she was the yearbook editor, and she was a cheerleader, and the most talkative, and she had a very outgoing personality.  But her life ended early.  And then my younger sister is Norma, N-O-R-M-A, Ray, Norma Ray.  She's married too, but she was a Holloway.  And Norma has her master's degree, and she is now a senior financial analyst for Johnson Products [sic.].
Speaker 1: In Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Oh, Johnson--
Speaker 2: Johnson Products.
Speaker 1: Okay, here or--
Speaker 2: Wait a minute, she's Johnson and Johnson.  Johnson Products is in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: She's at Johnson and Johnson.
Speaker 1: Johnson and Johnson, the Band-Aid people?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they make stints for your heart.  And they're more on the medical side--Band-Aids, mouthwash, Neosporin, all that good stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, she's a senior financial analyst for them.  And she has one son, and she lives here in Memphis.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 290811
Speaker 1: Now when you were growing up, your household consisted, at least the first eight years, of your mother [Beatrice Stevens Holloway], your father [John Holloway] and you and your, and you and then your sisters as they came along?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And did any of your grandmothers or grandparents live with you--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --growing up?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just a houseful of women, as my father described it.  And all of us are two years apart except the youngest, she was three.  So when he left, I was ten.  So, it was ten, eight, six, and three for the ages.  And so, my mom, she just stepped up to the plate.  And she lectured us every single Saturday for two hours until we became about seventeen or eighteen years old of age, just talking to us about life, education, and setting goals, and we heard that forever.  And we was brought up in church, and we were there at least six nights of the week.  So, we didn't get in much trouble (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, what church did you all attend?
Speaker 2: We attended Calvary Temple Church of God in Christ, and that's here in Memphis [Tennessee].  And by the time of my senior year [at Melrose High School, Memphis, Tennessee] my mother switched denominations, we became a Word church, which was Living, Living Word [Ministries Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee], Living Word.
Speaker 1: Now what's the difference?  I never heard of a Word, what's a Word church?
Speaker 2: Well, it's basically not making you feel convicted with what you wear.  It wasn't kind of like discriminating--like you've got to wear dresses all the time, or you can't wear makeup, you can't wear nail polish.  It's strictly dealing with what the Bible teaches.  It's more of a teaching ministry versus dealing with rituals or dealing with cultures.  Like, you know, some of them will tell you you've got to do this if you want to get to Heaven, and you got to do that.  So, it was basically teaching you the Word of God, and teaching you who you are in the eyesight of God, which was just completely different for us.  But we was happy, because we didn't have to wear dresses every day to school anymore.
Story_ID: 290812
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest, earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest, I don't know exactly how old I was, but you know how your family always kind of cracked jokes?  And they said when I was like four years old, I acted like I couldn't drink any other milk but chocolate milk.  And they said I was a greedy little baby, and that I could be asleep and my uncle would pass a slice of bologna across my nose in my sleep, and I would just wake up and eat the bologna in my sleep, and never miss a beat, (laughter).  And so when I got older, they always--when they wanted to embarrass me, they would always tell people about me sleeping and eating in my sleep and drinking the chocolate milk.  And so, that was about when I was four years old.  But other than that, not a whole lot of memory.  Remember when I first went to school, and I was excited about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But not--no stories at two years old, like my baby sister.  She's like "Yeah, I remember that."  We'd be like, "Right, we told you that," (laughter).
Story_ID: 290813
Speaker 1: Did you grow up in the same place the whole time?  When you, you know, did you live in the same house, or did you move?
Speaker 2: We moved only once.  Once my mother [Beatrice Stevens Holloway] married, we lived in Orange Mound [Memphis, Tennessee].  So, my mother and father [John Holloway] were homeowners in 1968.  So, that would make me two years old at that time.  So they were homeowners in Orange Mound, which at that time was ranked number two in the United States, next to Harlem [New York, New York], as for African Americans being homeowners.  So that was a big deal, for us to own a home in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: And you were saying Orange Mound.  Before we had the interview, we were talking about where it was.  And you say it's like south of South Memphis [Memphis, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: South Memphis is south of downtown, and then Orange Mound is south of that?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay. And (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  So, it's kind of like mid, it sits in the middle of the city almost.
Story_ID: 290814
Speaker 1: Melrose High School [Memphis, Tennessee], I guess, is the neighborhood high school that everybody goes to?
Speaker 2: Right, the largest and the best, and it still is the best high school.  In fact, Melrose was nominated School of the Year, but I believe we finished in the top five for School of the Year.  We have had three Olympic gold medalists to graduate from that school.  We have two or three Super Bowl champions.  And we--
Speaker 1: Well, I guess you may as well name them.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: If you can.
Speaker 2: The gold medalist--and in fact, all of us were there in the '80s [1980s].  Kennedy McKinley [sic. Kennedy McKinney], 1988, boxer, he was lightweight.  Sheila Echols was on the 4 x 100 meter relay [at the 1988 Summer Olympics, Seoul, Korea].  She gave the baton to Flo Jo [Florence Griffith Joyner] in Seoul, Korea.  And then myself, [HistoryMaker] Rochelle Stevens, a two-time Olympic gold and silver.  And then for football, we had Barry Wilburn, a quarterback with the Washington Redskins.  He was on the team with the great Doug Williams that came back and beat Brett Favre.
Speaker 1: Oh, right.
Speaker 2: The '88 [1988] Super Bowl team [Super Bowl XXII, San Diego, California].
Speaker 1: Yes.  And Cedrick Wilson, Cedrick Wilson? He was with the Pittsburgh Steelers for a Super Bowl ring, which was just a couple of years ago when the Pittsburgh Steelers won the Super Bowl [Super Bowl XL, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 2: Okay, when they beat Seattle [Seahawks].
Speaker 1: And Tori Noel, he was with the Denver Broncos when they won the Super Bowl [Super Bowl XXXIII, Miami, Florida].  So, that had to be like '94 [1994], '93 [1993], '94 [sic. 1999], Tori Noel.  So, those are our three Super Bowl champions.  And I can't name the other seven that are presently in the league right now for NFL [National Football League].
Speaker 2: The NFL, okay.
Speaker 1: The NFL.
Speaker 2: So is it a big football school, basically a lot of football?
Speaker 1: We pretty much dominated in every sport.  Because when I was there, we were state champs in basketball, girls and boys.  In track, girls and boys.  And then the football team was like runner-up, didn't quite make it to the state.  We have one NBA [National Basketball Association] champion.  He has a ring from the Detroit Pistons, and his name is William Bedford.  And he was seven feet tall.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: So, William, Sheila--just put it like this.  All of us except Tori and Cedrick, we all were at Melrose in the same time frame, walking those halls together.  We're like, now that's history, (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 290815
Speaker 1: Well, I want to go back to when you were growing up.  And I want you to tell us about your neighborhood [Orange Mound, Memphis, Tennessee].  Can you describe your house and--for us?
Speaker 2: Our home, it sat--if it was not on two acres, it seemed like it was on two acres, because I was the one that had to cut the grass.  And at that time, you didn't have the lawnmower that you could just kind of guide and it self-propelled.  And it was an (background noise) incline, so I got a good workout.  And we had a front yard filled with hedges, which was at least thirty or forty meters long, with hedges.  So, I was guaranteed to have poison ivy every year.  And our house was a white wooden house, and it didn't have the siding.  I don't think siding was in at that time.  And if you was in a brick home, you was like rich.  But we had a large porch, a high porch that sat up high.  And it was only two bedrooms and a formal living room and a formal dining room.  But all the bedrooms were like 14 x 16 [feet]; they weren't small rooms like they are now with the fireplace and the floor furnace.  And my father [John Holloway] had built out our bathroom and put double sinks with the black marble top.  So imagine, you have four girls in the house and you have less than an hour to get dressed.  And we were very organized.  You had one on this sink.  One was on the other sink.  And the person in the middle was ironing their clothes, and the other person, you know, would be doing something.  And all four of us maneuvered in that house, and we never had any problems.  And we was always on time, because my mother [Beatrice Stevens Holloway] (background noise) felt like a drill sergeant.  You better be ready.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that's what it was like.
Story_ID: 290816
Speaker 1: I was asking you about the sights and sounds and smells of growing up [in Orange Mound, Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 2: The sights were well manicured yards.  Everyone took pride in their yards and houses.  And my backyard, it was just, it was incredible, because we grew everything that you can grow except meat in our backyard.  I mean, we had the largest watermelons, we had the cantaloupes, all the beans, the peas, the corn, okra, tomatoes, lettuce, everything.  So, if you wanted something to eat, go to your backyard and pick out your fresh salad and come on in and fix it.  We had a plum tree, we had a peach tree and, well, most of the time the birds would beat us to the good ones.  But that was the sights and the smells that I basically had, which was just surrounded with fresh fruit and vegetables, homegrown.

Speaker 1: Tell us about, now what was your first school?  What was your grade school?
Speaker 2: My first grade school?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what was the name of the grade school you went to?
Speaker 2: It was Sharpe Elementary [School, Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Sharpe, okay.
Speaker 2: First and second grade.  And then they re-assigned the zone and I went to Cherokee Elementary [School, Memphis, Tennessee], third through six.  And then they started the bussing in my seventh grade year, and I was bussed to Richland Junior High [School, Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: And so, they started bussing, they bussed the black children to these predominantly white schools--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --at that point?
Speaker 2: That was my, that was the first year they started bussing, was my seventh grade year.  So, it had to be like '77 [1977], '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I was a part of the first group that was part of the bussing.  That only saved us about a three mile walk, you know.  Because if we had not been bussed, we would have had to walk three miles to get to the junior high, the closest junior high school.  Even though when we were bussed, we were bussed at least fifteen miles away from the home.  So if you missed the bus, you definitely did not get to school, because it was so far.  And so we never missed the bus.
Story_ID: 290818
Speaker 1: Did you like school?
Speaker 2: I didn't like elementary, I thought my teachers were pretty mean.  And I didn't know how to study or memorize things at that time.  So, whenever you don't make real good grades in school, you become a behavior problem in the class.  You know, you spit the balls, you got the spitballs working.  I used to heat up the eraser and put it under the person's neck and burn their neck.  Oh, it would just be so funny.  And--
Speaker 1: I never heard of that one.  You heat up the eraser?  How did you do that?
Speaker 2: You just take the eraser from the pencil and you keep rubbing it, and it would get hot.  And that rubber is hot.  And you touch somebody and they'd go, "Ouch."  Oh, it would just be so funny.  Well, I'm not going to tell you to try that.  But anyway that's when the teacher used to could pinch your ear and pull on your ear, or something like that.  So I was pretty much distracted because I didn't know how to study.  And the teachers didn't take out the time when you didn't catch on as fast.  You know, they had their pet peeves.  And when you see that you're not going to get any attention, you just deliberately do things to be disruptive--throw airplanes, write on your desk, drop paper.  And that's what I basically did in elementary.  Once I got to junior high [Richland Junior High School, Memphis, Tennessee] and you want to play sports, they let you know, "Well, you can't make anything lower than a D or a C."  And it started changing a little bit from there.  And by eighth grade, my mother [Beatrice Stevens Holloway], she wouldn't let me go outside.  She was like, "You get in there and you memorize that stuff."  And I'm like, "Memorize?"  And she started teaching me how to put things to memory, and it was for a history exam.  And working as a behavioral specialist with the students now at my alma mater, Cherokee [Elementary School, Memphis, Tennessee], I get to tell them the story of how I was a disruptive student, and I understand where they're coming from.  And I said, I said, "I was so dumb."  The history teacher would give you all the answers the day before the test.  He would tell you exactly what's on the test, and he would give you all the answers.  Of course, they were close to a paragraph long.  And then the day of the test, he would let you write all the answers on the back of the test.  And the last minute of the test, he would let you get all the answers off the back of the test.  So, I used to think that I could write that fast. That I could flip over the paper--constantly flipping--and gee, I was still making like a 38 [percent], 28 [percent], 15 [percent], on the history exams.  I was like, "How dumb can you be?  You had all the answers and everything."  And that's because I didn't know how to study.  And when my mom didn't let me go out, and had me to study, I made a 98 [percent] on that next history exam.  I didn't even need the answers on the back.  And it felt so good until I didn't even want to go back to 28 [percent] and 38 [percent] grades.  And that's where it basically started, from my mom making me stay in the house and teaching me how to put things to memory.  And I went from being that C student to a B student.  And by the time I made it to high school [Melrose High School, Memphis, Tennessee], I was 3.5, 3.6, 3.8 GPA every report card period, and even got to college and made the dean's list.  So-
Speaker 1: Now-
Speaker 2: --to me that was a milestone.
Story_ID: 290819
Speaker 1: How did you feel socially going to this predominantly white school [Richland Junior High School, Memphis, Tennessee]?  How many of you all went over?
Speaker 2: It was just our busloads.  I think they had maybe ten busses to come into the neighborhoods, all parts of the area.  And the way they did it is, one side of the street was bussed and the other side walked.  And every street was like that.  So, we didn't really care for that part of it, being split up from our friends.  Because one, they had the good sports teams, and they was going to whip up on our schools anyway.  But getting over there, it was pretty interesting, considering 'Roots' was on television every night.
Speaker 1: Oh, while you were--
Speaker 2: That was the year of the transition.  And 'Roots' had just come out, with [Alex] Haley.
Speaker 1: That was 1977.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  And so, to look at 'Roots'--
Speaker 1: And Alex Haley was from Tennessee.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  To look at that, and then you go to class the next day, it was just so much animosity and hatred.
Speaker 1: On the part of who to who?
Speaker 2: Both parties.  It's like blacks were mad because we were finally getting a chance to see what happened, kind of sort of.  And then you had the Caucasians like, "Why are you all at our school?"  And--
Speaker 1: Well, were they--I mean before 'Roots' came on the air, were they, was there still, was there animosity then?
Speaker 2: Well, we would not know, because we was at our predominantly black schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, you wouldn't really know if you're not taken out of your surroundings, or your comfort zone.  But we was able to tell the difference.  And some of the young people would say, "You all better catch that bus tonight, because my dad's in the Ku Klux Klan [KKK], and we gonna get y'all tonight.  We're going to get y'all."  So we used to be praying that the bus that was going to pick us up was not going to be late, you know, and hope that they didn't show up with the white sheets and the fire, you know.  So, that was kind of a little scary, especially being a seventh grader, and to actually have students in your class, knowing that their fathers were Klan members, and that they would proudly tell you that.  But I don't think they would have told us that if 'Roots' wasn't on television every night for like two weeks.
Speaker 1: Now, I'd be inclined to disagree with you, because I've heard other stories of people who integrated before 'Roots' came on the air.  But in terms of how it made the black students feel, now that's different, because it had never been on before.
Speaker 2: Well, I just, it was like hatred was built up.  You know, like how could they do us like that?  And in fact, I didn't even watch all of 'Roots' because I just couldn't handle it.  And after watching it a couple of nights with Chicken George and some others, I just couldn't handle watching that at the age of twelve.
Speaker 1: So, it didn't help you.  You think it hurt you really in terms of--?
Speaker 2: I couldn't take looking at what we was going through at all.  And I was only twelve years old.  So, I refused to watch it.  And everybody was talking about it on the bus, and what had happened.  You know, they were like, "Well, that was then.  This is now."  You know, but with me not watching it and still being able to hear parts of the conversation, I just wasn't able to watch that.

Speaker 1: Did you start playing instruments in middle school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I started band in the sixth grade [at Cherokee Elementary School, Memphis, Tennessee].  They had a summer program, you know.  Some people would go to summer camp; they'd go to basketball and different things.  They had a band camp, because at that time they were recruiting young people to join the band.  And everybody on our street was in the band, and that's how I, you know, got involved with the band.  I didn't have a clue that I would be in the band.  I knew that I liked to sing and I knew I liked music, but I didn't imagine playing the music.  But it was a challenge, because we didn't want anybody on our street to be the worse musician in their section.  And all of us used to practice every day in somebody's backyard, everybody on our street, that is.  And we would work with each other even though we played different instruments.  But we pushed each other.  And whenever we would take the band class and the band director may point someone out, we was always that section leader.  And we'd be like, "Yes, that's our street, Haynes Street," you know.  So, we did a lot of things with more pride back then.
Story_ID: 290821
Speaker 1: Were you always involved in athletics, or did you--?
Speaker 2: I was always involved in athletics as well.  In fact, I saw the 'Wilma Rudolph Story' [sic. 'Wilma'] when I was in elementary.  And the first time I saw it, I was so inspired.  I was like, "Wow, I want to be like Wilma Rudolph."  And I told my mom [Beatrice Stevens Holloway], I said, "Mom, I want to go to the Olympics, I want to go to the Olympics."  She was like, "Okay, you can go to the Olympics."  And that's when she told me that she ran track, and she ran 100 yards in like 10:09.  And I was like, "Whoa, that's like real fast."
Speaker 1: That is fast.
Speaker 2: On that gravel track.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And she took me to Melrose [High School] Stadium [Memphis, Tennessee] and said, "This is where we came when I was in high school," and she showed me that--it was gravel, especially by the time I got there.  And she was like, "This is where your mom ran the 100 [meter race], and I broad jumped over here."  And so, it was like a special, sentimental thing for me.  And when I jogged around the track, all I could think of was, "Wow, my mom ran the state championships here.  My mom, my mom, she won some titles."  So it had a special meaning, and I actually told everybody on our street, "I'm going to the Olympics, I'm going to the Olympics."  And I was extremely short at that time; I was short and I was tiny.  So, when you looked at me, you're like, "Yeah baby, okay, sure you're going to the Olympics."
Speaker 1: Well, were you short for your age?
Speaker 2: I was short for my age, and I was skinny.  I did not get tall until I got to high school [Melrose High School, Memphis, Tennessee].  I woke up the next day, and I was just a string bean.  And so I told the mailman, I told everybody.  And my mom was like, "Well, what you need to do is just start running."  And she raced me, and blew me out in our backyard.  And she said, "Hey, if you get on toes, you might can run faster."  And so--
Speaker 1: Your mother could out-run you when you were--
Speaker 2: She blew me out.  It was more than out-running me, she blew me out.  So, that means my mother was only thirty years old.  And I guess any thirty year old that's going to run against someone ten, you better beat them.  If you don't, you're in trouble.  But she recognized the very first time she ran against me that I was running flat-footed.  And she suggested, "You know, if you run on your toes, you can run a lot faster.  That's what I did."  And once she gave me that advice, no one could touch me, blocks away.  I mean, we were always having races in the streets, races on the playground.  And I was the fastest child at Cherokee Elementary [School, Memphis, Tennessee] when I was like ten years old.  I was out-running sixth graders, I was out-running everybody.  And I actually would jog home every day from school, which was about two miles.  I would give my books to my sisters, and I jogged home every day, talking about, "I'm going to the Olympics."  So, when it came to fruition, people would be like, "Whoa, I remember you telling me that.  You know, you were so tiny and you were so small."  And when I actually made my first Olympic team [for the 1992 Summer Olympics Barcelona, Spain], they were like, "Wow, now, that's someone that actually achieved the dream."
Speaker 1: Now, did--could you out-run the boys, too?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I out-ran all of the boys, the girls, I don't care what street you came from.  It was like, "Let's race, let's race."  You'd get in the street and you actually raced to those light poles.  Then my neighbors would have their cousins come to town from Mississippi and Michigan and everywhere, "Oh, my cousin, he gonna beat you, he'll beat you."  It did not make a difference, you--I was untouchable.  I beat everybody, even my uncle who was sitting on the porch half drunk and said, "You think you can run.  I'll race you."  And my uncle raced me like when I was thirteen years old, in the street.  And he was, he was rolling.  And that last five meters, I pulled up and he looked over at me, and I went on past him.  And he said, "What?  Oh, you bad, you beat your uncle, you beat your uncle."  So, it was something, to actually race a grown man.  You know, I just had that turnover in the speed.  And he was like, "You gonna be all right, you gonna be all right."  You know, so that's how that running career really took off.
Story_ID: 290822
Speaker 1: When we first came in, I think a couple, I asked you a couple of questions.  And you revealed an astounding knowledge of the history of the Olympics.  Did you start learning about that, I mean about the history of the Olympics back in those days?
Speaker 2: I believe I started learning the history of it when I was in high school [Melrose High School, Memphis, Tennessee].  Because my high school coach, Mike Webb [ph.], used to tell us it's not good enough to participate in a sport, you need to know the history.  You need to know what the competitors did before you, how much risk did they get?  What did they eat?  What kind of workouts did they do?  Don't just be a part of a sport and not know the history.  And so, I was like, okay, and that's when I started doing research.  Because you didn't have the Internet at that time, you just had to go to the library, and you'd pull out the books and you'd read about different ones.  And of course, every time we had a book report to do, I always wrote about some Olympian.  (Laughter) I figured that would be easier for me, to write about an athlete that I had read about.  And not only in my sport, but I kind of keep up with all the athletes.  I just look at it as one big happy family, and we all have to put in the hard work and the discipline, and we have that respect for each other's talent.  And I just refuse to go out and not know anything about other athletes and other sports.  Because I said you never know, you might have the opportunity to meet them.  And I didn't want to be like, "Oh, you play basketball?  I didn't know you played basketball."  I wanted to be able to communicate and talk to them about basketball, or football, or soccer, or tennis.  So, I still pretty much keep up with all the sports to this day.
Speaker 1: Now, other than Wilma Rudolph, did you keep up with some of the other black sports figures on television in those days?  I know in the mid-'70s [1970s]--you would have been kind of young when Arthur Ashe went in--
Speaker 2: I was young for Arthur Ashe.  But you know at that time it was O.J. Simpson, he was a big household name.  And as you got to high school, it was Tony Dorsett with the [Dallas] Cowboys.  And everybody wanted to be like Dr. J. [Julius Erving], with the basketball.  Everybody had the little thing working with Dr. J.  And so, Wilt Chamberlain--and I was familiar with the icons of the sport.  And you're just like, "Wow, they are awesome," you know.  Magic Johnson--like wow, they're awesome, and especially having your friends that's playing sports.  And our coaches are telling them, "One day, you're going to go pro."  So, you kind of start watching to the other sports to see if your colleague is actually going to be able to make it to that level one day.
Story_ID: 290823
Speaker 1: Now, was your focus basically track only, or did you play other sports?
Speaker 2: I played basketball as well; I really loved basketball.  In fact, I used to wake up and do a hundred, one hundred free throws before everybody else got out the bed.  I would do about fifty lay-ups.  I would start under the goal and work my way around.  And they call it the little horse, you know.  We would shoot around--
Speaker 1: Outdoors?
Speaker 2: Outdoors.  I had a basketball goal in my backyard.  Of course, we had played out the grass.  So, it was a good old smooth dirt court.  And by the time everybody else got out the bed, I probably would have already jogged three or four miles and warmed up with the basketball.  And I would do all those lay-ups.  And then when we'd go to the park to play, I would be the only little dusty little girl out there.  And the guys were like, "Oh, no, I don't want no girl on my team."  And the way you select those teams was the person would go the free throw line.  And if you get the free throw, the first two people select their teams.  And I was always like, "Give me the ball, give me the ball, give me the ball."  So I always had my own team, I was always out there.  So they later found out, "Oh, this girl can play."  And I learned how to dribble very well, take it behind my back, between my legs.  And I ended up making the teams in junior high [Richland Junior High School, Memphis, Tennessee].  We won the city championships my ninth grade year.  And I was the starting point guard, averaging ten points, maybe five or ten steals a game because I had that speed with it.  And of course, I always ran track.  And the reason I ended up choosing track over basketball is because at that time the women were not going pro.  And if you did go pro, you had to go to Europe and play.  And Europe really sounded extra, extra (background noise) foreign at that time.  You know, if you barely left out of the backyard in your home or your state, you could just hang up going to another whole country.
Story_ID: 290824
Speaker 1: And I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So you used to visit Chicago [Illinois] right (unclear)?
Speaker 1: After my--when I got older.
Speaker 2: Okay. But at that point, how far away from home had you been?
Speaker 1: At that point, I started traveling, because I ran summer track.  So we had the opportunity to compete at the AAU Junior Olympics.  And my first trip was to Mobile, Alabama.  I said, "Wow, we're going to Mobile," like that was a big deal.  But when you're twelve and thirteen, it is a big deal.  You know, everyone else is not going anywhere at all.  So, I had the opportunity to go to like Mobile, Alabama, Athens, Georgia.  I went to South Carolina, I went to Dayton, Ohio.  All of that was within the first summer--Kansas City [Kansas], you're thinking about Dorothy with "No place like home," and you're going to Kansas City actually looking for her probably.  And so, I had the opportunity to travel extensively from the age of twelve on up.  And you know, farthest was probably Nebraska.  I went to West Virginia.  So, I had the opportunity to do a lot of traveling in the summertime through our summer track program.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, so when you were a freshman [at Melrose High School, Memphis, Tennessee], is that the first time you actually ran?  Well, you ran in the meets in middle school right?
Speaker 2: Twelve years, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you off in the winter?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was regionally.  And my first national championship was when I was twelve, in Dayton, Ohio.  And I finished fourth in the nation.  So that was my first big, major competition.
Speaker 1: That was the Junior Olympics?
Speaker 2: Junior Olympics.
Speaker 1: About what year is that?
Speaker 2: Probably '78 [1978], '79 [1979].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so every year, the nationals for the AAU Junior Olympics, I was always in the top three.  And we were national champions when I was fifteen, and that was in Nebraska.  I also won the free trip to West Virginia for the Hershey Chocolate meet [Hershey Youth Outdoor Championships], which is a nation-wide meet.  And the way that goes is you race in tennis.  And according to your region, you have to have the fastest time in the entire region.  So, at that time they took the ten southern states.  And the fastest quarter-miler out of the ten southern states, which never saw each other, wins the trip.  And I won that trip when I was thirteen years old, racing in tennis.  So, I represented the southern region at the Hershey meet in West Virginia.
Story_ID: 290825
Speaker 1: We were talking before the interview also about how individuals are chosen to run the 400 meters.  And how, just explain what that process is like.
Speaker 2: Well, at that time every child wants to be a sprinter.  But then when I started running summer track and you had those athletes that started at the age of nine and ten, they had real training versus just racing on the street.  And I didn't quite match up to them.  And my mom [Beatrice Stevens Holloway] was like, "Why don't you just run something that everybody else don't want to run?"  And she recommended that I do the 800, 800 yards.  It wasn't 800 meters at the time, it was 800 yards.  And--
Speaker 1: The 800 yard run, okay.
Speaker 2: It was 880 in fact.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was two laps.  I was like, "Ooh, that's the boring stuff.  Nobody wants to run all that boring stuff."  And she said, "Well, the boring stuff, no one's dominating the boring stuff."  And so, I took my mom's advice and switched over from the sprint coach to the middle distance coach.  And he was such an inspiration in my life.  His name was Tony Wakefield, and he was on a full scholarship at that time at Tennessee State University [Nashville, Tennessee] as a half-miler and a miler.  And he used to always tell me, "You're going to be awesome, you're going to be bad.  You're going to be tough.  Girl, you're going to be something."  And I was saying, "Yeah, yeah, you're just telling me that because you want me to run all these laps."  But he actually knew what he was talking about, and he had me well-prepared every summer.  And I dominated the 800 meters all the way up until my senior year.  And I kind of got a little lazy, and didn't want to put in all the work.  So my high school [Melrose High School, Memphis, Tennessee] coach, Mike Webb [ph.], put me in the 400 meters, something that I always really wanted to run anyway.  And then he put me in the 200 meters for a joke, and I end up winning the state in the 200 meters, with 24.5 seconds, which was a decent time.  And--
Speaker 1: Now what year is it?  Were you a junior then or--
Speaker 2: A senior.
Speaker 1: A senior?
Speaker 2: My senior year.  I completely left the two mile relay, the 800 meter run, and the mile relay.  Now I'm a sprinter.  And everybody in the stands thought it was so fun.  They was like, "What?  She's in the 200?"  No blocks, didn't even know how to get in the start position or anything.  And once I won that first 200 meters, everybody was like, "Wow, you're gonna be bad."  So he kept me in the 200 and the 400, and in my senior year I won the 400 and the 200 at the state championships.
Story_ID: 290826
Speaker 1: I'm sure there were probably quite a few women and men here in town who were, who attended Tennessee State [University (TSU), Nashville, Tennessee].  I mean, that was like one of the top, you know, track schools in the country.  So, did you know any of those athletes?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I knew several of the alumnus, at least I knew their names.  In fact, at Melrose [High School, Memphis, Tennessee] the majority of our teachers were graduates of Tennessee State University.  And I was like, well, maybe I'll go to Tennessee State.  But my coach, Tony Wakefield, was like, "Oh, no, you're not going to Tennessee State.  You're going to the University of Tennessee [Knoxville, Tennessee], and you're going to keep up that great reputation of half-milers, Joetta Clark [Joetta Clark Diggs] and Delisa Walton [Delisa Walton-Floyd]."  And he was naming all these girls.  And he was like, "By time you get there, they'll be graduating and you can dominate."  So I knew ever since I was about thirteen that I would possibly go the University of Tennessee.  But I wanted to meet the great legend, the coach for Tennessee State.  I always wanted to meet the coach, Coach Temple, Ed Temple [Edward Temple].  And when I met him, he was so nonchalant, like, "Hey, how you doing?" and he walked off.  And my little feelings was hurt.  And I was like, "I'm not going to that school.  He didn't even have the decency to even speak to me."  And so that was such a turnoff, because he was so rude on that day.  I don't know if he had anything on his mind, but that definitely made me say I'm not going to that school. And my junior year when we raced at Tennessee State for an invitational meet--we never competed there.  He had all his top recruits from New York and everywhere, and they came down to run in this meet.  And they were all supposed to be signing, you know, to officially say they were going to go to TSU.  And the 400 meter race, which I'd never run, but my coach put me in it just for fun.  And the state champion was a Melrose--a colleague of mine, she was undefeated, never been beaten in the 400.  So, he put us two in the race.  And they had these twins out of New York.  They was ranked number one in the State of New York at 400 and 800.  And they introduced everybody like "Future Tigerbelle," you know, and the crowd's going wild.  And all I was thinking was well, there's Gina [ph.], and I'm supposed to get second.  Because you know, she has been undefeated, and she was my best friend.  And when the race went on, you know, I'm running.  And the last 100 meters, I'm like right beside Gina, like, yes, we're one and two, this is where I'm supposed to be.  I didn't have any intentions on winning, because I thought that she was supposed to win, because that's her event.  And then these twins started coming up.  And I looked up, and I said, oh, they're not going to beat me.  And I shifted gears because of that 800 strength, and I went past her as well.  And I beat all of his recruits.  So, it later on came to like, "Yes, you didn't recruit me.  You didn't even say hello to me.  And look at that, I whipped up on all your top recruiters."  You know, so it was kind of like a little revenge race, but it wasn't supposed to be a revenge race.  Then he was ready to speak.  I was a junior, and he was ready to speak then. I was like--
Speaker 1: What did he say?
Speaker 2: "Stevens [HistoryMaker Rochelle Stevens], how are you doing?  I'm Ed Temple."  I was like, now I'm the nonchalant person.  I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, I know."  But no interest at all after that experience.  I had to be about fourteen when I first met him, because you get to read about this legend and he produced all these Olympians.  And it's like wow, they play you off like, "Yeah, yeah, how you doing?"  (Laughter) And he was actually like that, like, "Move on little girl, I don't have time to talk to you."  (Laughter) So, that was my first impression of Ed Temple.
Speaker 1: So, you knew he was the coach of Wilma Rudolph?
Speaker 2: Yes, of course.  It was like, "Wow there's Coach Temple!"  I was actually shaking in my knees.  It was like, "Oh, my gosh, that's that coach, that's the coach."  And I ran up to him, you know, I was already tiny.  He probably thought I was in elementary in that case, you know, and just, "Yeah, yeah, whatever."  You know, my little feelings were hurt.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in high school [Melrose High School, Memphis, Tennessee], were you a good student?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was.  I was honor roll in high school.
Speaker 1: Did they threaten your athletic career with, you know, making--you said at some point in middle school [Cherokee Elementary School, Memphis, Tennessee]--
Speaker 2: That was like junior high [Richland Junior High School, Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: In junior high, you turned the corner--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --as far as studying.
Speaker 2: Because the coaches would let you know that you could not play for them if you didn't have a certain GPA--you couldn't have certain grades.  So, I knew that I wanted to run track and play basketball, and you have to make sure that conduct is right.  No more spitting balls and heating up those erasers.  I had to straighten up my act and get those grades right, and that's what basically happened.
Speaker 1: Now, was it hard to get good grades with the athletic schedule that you had?
Speaker 2: Not really, because my mom [Beatrice Stevens Holloway] made sure that we studied, you know.  I don't know how most families are, but with my mom's household, we all had to sit at the dining room table together and do our homework.  And then she would actually check your homework.  And if it was even written sloppy, "Where you think you're going with this?" You know, she took pride in the work that we did as well.  And she would make you re-write it.  And I'll never forget, my sister had eaten some chicken, and she had chicken grease all over her paper.  And she gave that to my mom, and my mom had a fit.  She was like, "You will not embarrass this family turning in this greasy paper."  And she made her re-do it.  So, my mom helped institute study habits.  We had times when we studied together.  Like I say, we prayed together.  We did everything together as a family, and that's why we're so close.  It's because of the upbringing that my mother instilled in us ever since we was young.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was your favorite subject?  What did you focus on in high school?
Speaker 2: My favorite subject ended up being history, because going from a 28 [percent] to a 98 [percent].  So, history ended up being my favorite subject.  And I ended up majoring in history in high school, history and music, those were my majors.  Because I figured I liked history and I could put things to memory, and so, that was very exciting for me.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any special role during graduation?
Speaker 2: Not really, other than I was the head director of the choir for the high school.  So, during the program, of course, I got to come out and direct the number one choir in the city.
Speaker 1: Okay, you, they let the students direct the choir?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You had to audition.  So that means you had to be able to sight-read music and teach music as well.  And I auditioned in my tenth grade year.  So, I was the head director of our gospel choir for tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grade.  I was always in Tennessee, so you have those auditions where you make All-City choirs and you make the All-State choirs with competitions.  And I was always Tennessee in both, in the band and in the choir.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what instrument did you concentrate on in the band?
Speaker 2: B-flat clarinet.  But I also played snare drums and bass guitar.  But my main instrument was B-flat clarinet.  I was the first chair B-flat clarinet player from sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth grade.  And it took up so much time because the band, naturally they practice after school.  And you got the track team that wanted to practice.  And the band teacher didn't think that the track was important, and the track person didn't think that the music was important.  So, I said, forget it, when I get to high school I'll just get in the choir.  And I got in the choir, not knowing that it was going to be the same conflict of interest.  And so, I would be in choir rehearsal stretching and getting ready.  Because you don't get a grade to be an athlete, but you had to get the grade to do music.  So, I was like, "Wow."  So, definitely when I went to college [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], I didn't enroll in any form of music at all.
Story_ID: 290828
Speaker 1: How did you manage to choose Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Morgan State was at the track meet when I upset those seniors my junior year [at Melrose High School, Memphis, Tennessee].  And everybody on the team were 5'9", 5'10", and six feet tall, and all of them were quarter-milers.  He had two mile relays.  And they stomped all over Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and Middle Tennessee [State University, Murfreesboro, Tennessee], and they beat up on everybody.  And I'm like, "Where's that little school?"  And I was like, "I don't care where they are, those girls are bad, and I want to be just like them."  But I wasn't as tall as they were at that time.  It was like, wow, they're running in an event that I want to specialize in, and every last one of them were tall.  So, I was really inspired from the athletes that were on the Morgan State team, knowing that I was going to go to the University of Tennessee [Knoxville, Tennessee].  Because I was told that ever since, you know, I was a little girl.  So, when they were able to get in contact with me, which was the senior year--because they really can't say anything to you when you're a junior--I had the twenty scholarships, and you can only visit five schools.  And it may sound petty, but I went to some of the schools because of the state they were located in.  I was like, "Well, I've never been to Florida, so I'm going to go visit Florida."  I visited the University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida].  I visited SIU [Southern Illinois University] in Carbondale [Illinois].  I visited the University of Tennessee.  I went up to Morgan State University, and the last school that I visited was LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  And at that time most of those schools were not dominant in track, because they were still predominantly white at that time, and they were just beginning to bring in some African American athletes.  And I went to Florida and they were talking about having me run the mile.  I'm like, "The mile?  They really have lost their mind.  I am not running the mile."  That was such a turnoff.  I erased them off the list.  Because every week I was going up for school pictures.  Like Nebraska, it was recruiting me.  And you're just kind of looking at the school picture, like, ooh, that school is pretty.  Ooh, wow, wow, wow.  (Laughter) And every week, I didn't know where I was going to go.  But I was able to kind of just weed out the schools.  And when I went to visit Morgan State, the recruit trip was so impressive.  I mean, they didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have facilities.  And the coach was like, "Okay, we don't have a brand new track.  We don't have an up-to-date weight room, and you will not eat steaks here every day."  I said, "Well, if I go to Tennessee, we're going to be flying."  He said, "Fine.  You fly to the meet and we'll meet you there, and we're going to kick your butt.  Because we're going to ride the bus, just like you've been riding the bus since you've been twelve years old, and you haven't lost a race.  Now, why all of a sudden you've got to fly?  That's on you.  But if you come to Morgan, you're going to ride that van.  We ride everywhere on the van."  And I was looking like, "Okay."  And so he was, it was just, it was more, I felt more comfortable, you know.  And he was like, "You come here, and we're going to make sure you graduate.  You will not be over-sleeping and missing class.  You will get your degree.  You will graduate."  And no one didn't emphasize graduating from college to me, they didn't emphasize it.  Their concern was building a program, building a team.  And he just kept emphasizing, "You're going to graduate, you're going to graduate."
Speaker 1: Now, who was the person doing this?
Speaker 2: Leonard Braxton was the head coach.
Speaker 1: Leonard Braxton, okay.
Speaker 2: Leonard Braxton, Coach Braxton.
Speaker 1: We want to make sure we gave him credit.
Speaker 2: And he--
Speaker 1: It sounded like a pretty good effort.
Speaker 2: And he was always, you know, just emphasizing that you're going to graduate.  You will graduate.  And that's just something that I didn't really hear.  When I was growing up you kept hearing, "You're going to go to school, you're going to go to school, you're going to go to school."  But no one ever said, "And you will graduate."  And that's what really got my attention, hearing that.  It seemed like he took interest in my education, and not just my talent.  And that's (background noise) what drew me to Morgan State University.
Story_ID: 290829
Speaker 1: If you graduated, that would've make--that would make you the first graduate in your cl- in your family, right?
Speaker 2: Right, and I was the first one to graduate in my family.  In fact, I was the first one to attend college and graduate.  But, you know, coming from the background of those twenty-eights and those eighteens and Fs and Ds, you're not thinking about going to college.  And when you get a little older and you see your friends that were smart in school and they went to college and they flunked out, you're like, "Whoa, she flunked out?  Now, I know I'm going to flunk out."  (Laughter) But he kept emphasizing, "You will graduate."  So, that was kind of my fear, of wow, if smart people flunk out, how am I going to make it through college?  But it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, and I ended up finishing three and a half years versus the four years, when I ended up going to Morgan State University [Baltimore, Maryland].  So, I actually did graduate.  I was probably one of his first athletes to graduate in the four year plan versus the five, six, seven year plan that a lot of the athletes was doing at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, do you think you were well prepared, (background noise) you were very prepared for that, I guess?
Speaker 2: Prepared for college?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't think I was prepared for college, because I think I missed out on all of the basic foundation, like junior high [Richland Junior High School, Memphis, Tennessee] and elementary school [Cherokee Elementary School, Memphis, Tennessee].  And so, when I got to Morgan and I found out that they specialized in English and arts, literary arts, and writing, I was "Oh, please, I know I'm not going to graduate.  English, you've got to be joking."  And then I had enough nerve to major in communications, telecommunications.  You'd be writing papers every day.  And I was flunking papers every day.  And I pulled the papers out to the coach [Leonard Braxton], and he said, "Wow, this is incredible.  How can you flunk English?  You should be making an A in English."  I looked at him like, "What?"  He said, "As much as you run your mouth, that's all you got to do, is write everything you would possibly say out of your big mouth.  And trust me, you'll pass English."  And after that I just took it literally, and started passing English.  And by my junior year, I don't know if it's a requirement at a lot of schools, but you had to pass a speech proficiency.  You had to pass the writing proficiency along with having your required credits to graduate.  Now, if you had the required credits, but you did not pass the writing proficiency, they did not give you a degree.  You got a certificate showing that you attended college.  And so, I passed the writing (background noise) proficiency my junior year.  And it was a very small percentage of people that was passing the writing proficiency.  And I was prepared.  I had a lot of excellent mentors and people that would give advice and that helped me.  And I was the type of person that would listen, and apply what I listened to.  And I was like, it's hard.  You're taking sixteen credit hours, you're out of town every weekend.  You're half not in school, and you leave and they're on one chapter, and when you come back you're four chapters behind.  How is this going to work?  And some of the upperclassmen that were not athletes, were, you know, just giving me really sound advice as to when to take classes, or don't take too many classes that's going to require too much of your time--how to separate those classes, how to properly prepare.  Because being a telecommunications major, you're guaranteed to write a paper every time you step into a class.  Because they would say, "Oh, wow, what's the latest thing going on with Iran and Iraq?  Give me six hundred words on that."  I was sitting there looking like, "Are you serious?"  I couldn't write maybe ten.  I didn't have time to read the newspaper and all of that, I'm practicing and traveling.  But my colleagues, they were like, "Get out the bed and get up and watch the news.  Listen to everything they say, verbatim.  Listen to the radio, not to the music.  But just listen to the news.  And every chance you get, you read magazines or you read newspaper clippings."  And from that, I was able to write those six hundred words, a piece of cake.   And to this day, that is still my routine.  I get up every morning and I listen to NPR radio [National Public Radio] because they're national.  I might not have time to watch CNN, but I get that NPR news.  I never leave out without knowing what's going on in the world.  And it's a habit, and so it's a very good habit to have.
Story_ID: 290830
Speaker 1: Do you think that track, and maybe other sports, too, but I think especially in track--some of the people I met who were involved in track, (background noise) they traveled around.  It might have something to do with the nature of the sport.  It seems to culminate an interest in current events and news.  I don't know how it does it, but all the people that I know who run track seem to keep with events.
Speaker 2: I don't know if it was anything in particular or if it was just a personal interest.  I can't really say that for my teammates because they were business majors and engineer majors.  So, they didn't have the pressure of going to class and having to perform every time they stepped into that class--taking up arguments in debate, and taking up all those history (background noise) courses.  And everything that I basically took up, from philosophy, et cetera, everything was writing.  And to think that I could not write a paragraph when I graduated from high school [Melrose High School, Memphis, Tennessee], a decent paragraph, that is, and now I'm writing six hundred and a thousand word things on one subject.  It was, you know, it's impressive.  But it's a technique to it.  And if anyone had not ever shared that information with me, I probably still, to this day wouldn't be able to write.  So, when I talk to the young people with the schools and I tell them that story, I would, you know, give them examples.  I would use Tyler Perry for an example and say, "How many of you all saw 'Madea Goes to Jail'?"  And everybody raised their hand. "Like, can you imagine writing about 'Madea Goes to Jail'?"  I said, "That's what he did.  And he made eighty, ninety million dollars.  And we're laughing at it in the show, but look what he wrote.  So, if you take writing more seriously, maybe you can be the next millionaire."  And so, you kind of give them examples of things that they can relate to.  And then I would give them a topic.  And I would say, "I want you to tell me everything you know about fall.  What does fall consist of?"  You know, the trees, the colors, the--and I'd give the students all these different examples.  And these students went from writing two lines--and we're talking elementary--to writing a hundred words, a hundred fifty words, two hundred words, describing what fall is--every holiday, every color, anything that's dealing with it.  And they were able to write like that because that's how I was basically taught.  Someone taught me, so I'm now teaching them as a behavioral specialist whenever they come to my office--writing skills, and have them to use their thoughts, because they talk just as much as most people.  Put it on paper.
Story_ID: 290831
Speaker 1: Now, (background noise) I didn't ask you this until now.  But I do have to ask it.  How did you manage to choose telecommunications, or communications, as a major?
Speaker 2: Ever since I was younger, and I was always listening to the radio.  And I grew up saying I wanted to be a radio deejay.  And at that time, it was called disk jockey.  So, when the music would kind of go off, I would imitate the deejay on the radio.  And I'd say, "And this is Rochelle [HistoryMaker Rochelle Stevens], and you're listening to smooth 101.1.  And in the Memphis [Tennessee] area, it's going to be fifty-nine degrees, and it's cold."  And I would actually practice that when I was a kid.  I swear, I sounded so sexy.  Woo, that was cute.  But then when I got older and I saw how much money they made, I was like, "Woo, I don't wanna make $27,000 being a deejay."  And as you get a little older, you figure, okay (background noise-- wow the storm. It's really storming--when I got older I started saying, "I like listening to people's problems.  I think I want to be a psychiatrist, and go to school and major in psychology."  My mom [Beatrice Stevens Holloway] was like, "Really?"  "Yeah." Went to college and majored in psychology.  And oh, that class was so hard.  I made an A in psychology, and I flunked health.  And the coach [Leonard Braxton] said, "How is it that you flunked the easiest class in your curriculum and you passed mental health, you passed psychology, and you passed history?  You passed biology, but you flunked health," my freshman year.  And I said I had to study so hard for those classes.  And I said, "Forget it, I'm about to drive my own self crazy.  I'm not going to major in psychology."  So, I pulled out the curriculum--and I now tell high school students this story.  And so, I pulled out the curriculum, and I looked at what I thought I could hang with.  If it was a lot of math, can't major it that.  Foreign language, I don't think I'm going to be learning any French or Spanish.  I guess the only things left was to take some telecommunication classes, and that's how I came to the conclusion that I would major in it.  But Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland] made it even more exciting.  It wasn't just regular television.  It covered from public relations, public affairs, public development, magazine, television, radio.  So, it made a very wide open field, with an opportunity to work in any of those entities dealing with communications.  And that's how I got involved with that major.  But I knew I was a good salesperson, even though I didn't major in business, because I figured I might flunk statistics.  (Laughter) But you still need communications to deal with business.  And so, that's how it came about.
Story_ID: 290832
Speaker 1: Was Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland] in an athletic conference?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We were in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, known as the MEAC.  And it consisted of Howard University [Washington, D.C.], Delaware State [University, Dover, Delaware], Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], South Carolina State [University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], North Carolina A&T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], and Maryland Eastern Shore [University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Princess Anne, Maryland] , that I can just spit off the top of my head.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And was Morgan State the dominant team in the MEAC in track during that period of time?
Speaker 2: We were not the dominant team, because my coach [Leonard Braxton], he didn't focus on winning conference championships.  We were invited to all the big track meets that were televised.  Because my freshman year, the number one girl in the nation was in my freshman class, and she had made the Olympic team coming out of high school from New Jersey.  So, we were invited to all the big meets.  And our coach was, I wouldn't quite say arrogant, but he was over-confident.  And he used to say, "We're not going to the conference to help everybody else qualify for the NC's [national championship].  We'll run everything but our own events."  So, we never took the conference seriously, like Howard University and some of the other schools that dominated, like Delaware State.  I mean, those girls had to run so many events.  We were sitting under the tree chilling and eating chicken and cheering for them.  Because we were like, gee, we knew that when we left the conference we were headed to another major competition where the elite athletes were competing.  And we would be the only collegiate team, or collegiate runners, in the race with all the elites.  So, we would use our conference meets as warm-up meets.
Speaker 1: Now, who was this number one athlete in the nation at that time?
Speaker 2: Her name was Wenda, W-E-N-D-A, Vereen, Wenda Vereen [Wendy Vereen].  And I believe she now lives in Indianapolis [Indiana].  And like I said, she was ranked number one in the nation in high school.
Speaker 1: In what event?
Speaker 2: The 100 and 200 meters.  So, she was seventeen on the 1984 Olympic team in Los Angeles [California].  She finished sixth place in the Olympic finals of the 100, I believe she finished sixth.  But they took the top eight, and so she was the only high-schooler on that team.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was my teammate.
Story_ID: 290833
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about international competition.  When was your first international meet?
Speaker 2: Zagreb, Yugoslavia [Zagreb, Croatia] was a competition that was called World University [Games].  So, it was the best athletes all over the world that was still in colleges and universities.  And we represented the United States in Zagreba, Yugoslavia, and we won the gold medal.
Speaker 1: Zaghrev is spelled Z-A-G-H-R-E-V?
Speaker 2: It was Z-A-G-R-E-B at that time, Zagreb.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And of course I don't think it even exists as Yugoslavia anymore.  They have now all emerged and did different things.  So, that was my first foreign country, first passport.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did you like that?  I mean, did you like being in another country, or was it frightening?
Speaker 2: It wasn't frightening.  But to hear, you know, that you're going to a Communist country and to read about it in the history books, and now knowing that you're actually going over there.  It still wasn't as bad, considering we took a large portion of athletes.  It was not just track and field.  We had basketball, we had all the sports that was there.  So, it was a large team.  We had a lot of security there.  It was a lot of fun.  But as I got older and was able to travel to those foreign countries, that was a little bit more frightening than my very first experience.  I think one of my scariest experiences was going into East Berlin [German Democratic Republic; Berlin, Germany] when the [Berlin] Wall was still up.  And all I could think was gee, this agent, Pete, is really greedy.  Why do we have to race over here in East Berlin?  I mean, of all the countries in Europe, we're over here, you know, behind the wall.  What happens if we get stuck?  You know, Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] is going to have to come and free us.  Because that was shortly after when we had hostages held I believe in Iran somewhere, and Jesse Jackson negotiated and got them out.  And so, now I'm thinking Jesse is going to have to free us, you know.  (Laughter) And East Berlin was probably one of the most frightening trips.  Because they told us we couldn't wear U.S.A. uniforms--that they didn't like Americans and that we had to change out the uniforms.  And--
Speaker 1: To what?  I mean were you there representing the United States or Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: At that time, we were representing Nike, but we still had U.S.A. gear.  And that was my first year as a world class athlete on the circuit.  And I remember vaguely it's like, you know, when you watch those television shows with folks skating, and they have the fence up so you can't throw the bananas and the cans and things.  Well, those things was fenced up as if though those people were gonna to throw something on the track.  So, I was really ready for that meet to end.  Not to mention, it was around the 4th of July, so I'll never forget it.  We spent the 4th of July in East Berlin eating peanut butter crackers with hot Coca-Cola, and that was our dinner.
Speaker 1: So, they didn't feed you, the host--
Speaker 2: We didn't trust what they was eating in East Berlin.  I mean, when we got up for breakfast one morning--and when you finish--they don't eat the traditional breakfast food like we have.  Its cold cuts and vegetables and fruit that's got little bugs still kind of flying around them.  And we saw all of these eggs.  I'm like, "Yes, eggs, we can eat some boiled eggs," you know.  And everybody got an arm full of the eggs.  And one guy got to the table before we did and cracked the egg.  And they only boil them for a minute.  So, it was raw eggs.  And we were like, well, I guess we'll just have to eat some bread.  So, we were pretty hungry in East Berlin. Didn't quite trust the--
Speaker 1: When were you there?  Were you still in college when you were there?
Speaker 2: That was my first year out of college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was in '89 [1989].
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: And you know, the wall came down in December of '89 [1989].
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's after you got back?
Speaker 2: I had barely missed the wall coming down (laughter).
Story_ID: 290834
Speaker 1: Now you would go to the Penn Relays [Penn Relay Carnival] every year?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And the other big meets around the nation?
Speaker 2: The Penn Relays was a highlight meet, especially for my teammates, because the majority of my teammates were from the East Coast.  Their high schools were there every year racing at the Penns.  And I never really heard of the Penn Relays until I got to Morgan [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  I was like, "What's the big deal about the Penns?"  But when you get there and you have sixty thousand spectators, it's like okay, that's the big deal about the Penn Relays.  This is as close to the Olympics you might get the chance to run in front of that many people at one time.  And my freshman year there, Bill Cosby filmed something for 'The Cosby Show.'  And he was racing the American record holder in the 400 meters, Valerie Brisco-Hooks.  And he thought he was winning, and she'd catch up and tap him on the behind and pass him.  Well, we were actually there for the set, and sitting less than, you know, a foot from him.  And I was like, wow, the celebrities coming to Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and all of these people coming to Penn, and it helps to win.  We were Penn Relay champions.  And you're wearing your Penn Relay watch and you couldn't even tell time on it, it had so many alphabets on it.  If someone asked you what time it is, we go, "Penn Relay time."  And then we figured out, like, oh, we didn't never know what time it was.  We couldn't tell what time it was.
Speaker 1: Was it still televised on ABC's 'Wide World of Sports'?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: That was an annual--
Speaker 2: Only certain events, the highlighted events.  And we, our race was not shown.  They televised the whole thing, but our race was not televised at that time.  But I would have my friends back here in Memphis [Tennessee] watching the Penn Relays on television to see if they would see me.  And of course, they did not see me.  But my mom [Beatrice Stevens Holloway] would be there, because she would fly up every year for the Penn Relays to see me run.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Right.  Now, did you have a, I guess, a running plan or a running philosophy of how you were going to approach a race?  And you ran in the 4 x 400 relay, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And then you ran the 400 meters, too?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: At this time, at this juncture in college, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, and 200 and everything--4 x 100 and the 100 meters.  I dropped all the way to the hundred.
Story_ID: 290835
Speaker 1: What was your running philosophy, or your running plan?  I guess it differed in terms of the length of the race, right?
Speaker 2: It did.  My philosophy was just get out there and win.  With me, coming from the South, and attending school in a whole completely different region, no one was familiar with me, naturally.  And everywhere I went I wanted to make sure that if you didn't know me, you will before I leave this meet.  Because I was always there with a vengeance, and that was basically my whole career.  I ended up becoming the MVP performer for four years, the whole time I was at Morgan [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], the Female Athlete of the Year Award recipient.  And I still hold the school records from my freshman year basically up to right now, 2010, in the 100 meters at 11:17, 200 meters, 22:84 and 400 meters, 51:01.  And someone got close to those records, and I was so happy when she graduated.  I sent her a graduation gift.  That was about in 1997, '98 [1998].  That was ten years later.  She was from one of those Caribbean islands.  But when she graduated, I was like, whew!
Speaker 1: Who was it?
Speaker 2: I don't remember her name, because she was a little island girl.  But I would see them at the Penn Relays [Penn Relay Carnival] or see them at a meet every now and then.  And she'd say, "Oh, Miss Stevens [HistoryMaker Rochelle Stevens], I broke your 200 meter record."  "Oh, what, you did?"  I said, "What did you run?"  "23:08."  "Whew, 22:84, baby, you did not get that record, when you graduating?"  So I was keeping up with the track team, because with my sponsors, I would ask my sponsors, Johnson Products [Inc.], Maybelline, and Nike, to make a contribution to Morgan State's track team.  So, when I'd go back for homecoming, I would always be able to take a check back and have it designated strictly for the track team.  Because when I was there, they used to say, "Now, when you all graduate, give it back to the track team.  Because if you give it to the school, they're going to keep it for the school.  And you all know we need equipment."  And so, I made sure that it specified Morgan State track team whenever I gave contributions back to Morgan.

Speaker 1: But, when you ran a race, though, did you have a, did you run the one--did you run the 200 [meter] the same?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, you always ran everything the same day (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) With the same intensity?  I mean, with the same intensity that you ran the 100 [meter]?  I mean, did you go all out on the 200, and just had more stamina at the finish?  Or did you have to slow your pace yourself, or what?
Speaker 2: I didn't have to pace myself because I was still not a full-fledged sprinter.  I still had that half-miler stride, and I still kind of had the slower turnover.  I always had the endurance.  I only ran the 100 a few times, it was not a regular race for me.  But the 400 and the 4 x 400 meter relay were regular races.  200, I'd get a chance to visit it, but it just so happened that at the NC's [national championships] I finished third in the open 200 meters, and won the 400 meters.  But we was All-American every year.  I was an eleven time NCAA [National Collegiate Athletics Association] All-American, because whenever you finished in that top six in the finals, you're All-American.  So, our 4 x 100 and 4 x 400 meter relays were in the finals every year just about, within my four-year span at Morgan [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you run the 4 x 400 meter relay?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was the second leg on every relay that we had.  So, the way our coach [Leonard Braxton] had set it up, we put our weakest leg for the start.  And then I would just be like Pac-Man, and just go get everybody.  I mean if you was in front of me, that was my mission, to get you.  I didn't care if you had 100 meters on me, I just did not care.  I ran with that type of tenacity, like a pit bull.  Once I'd get that baton, I was just coming to get you, coming to get you.  And when I'd get that stick off, we would be back in the race, and the rest of my teammates was able to maintain wherever we were, either in the front, or barely in the front.  But at least we was out of the hole, which we was always a good forty or fifty meters behind the last team.  We're not even talking about the first team, we're talking about the last team.  I'd just be standing there, "Just bring me the baton, just bring me the baton."  And so, I always ran with a fire.
Story_ID: 290837
Speaker 1: You have a slim build.  Did you have to eat more food more often when you were training and really running than you do now?
Speaker 2: I ate a lot, but with all that training that was going on, it was just burning off as fast as you could eat it.  And with my father [John Holloway] being slender built, I believe it has a lot to do with hereditary versus--I never had to worry about going on a diet.  I was always trying to put on weight, which that never happened (laughter).
Speaker 1: But then you had to eat more then, when you were running than you do--
Speaker 2: Well, you eat, it was certain things that we would eat.  I ate a lot of pasta for the energy, mainly pasta.  I didn't eat as much soul food, but pasta every single day.
Speaker 1: Macaroni, spaghetti--
Speaker 2: Spaghetti.  Like you said, fettuccine, spaghetti, macaroni.  I didn't eat a lot of pizza, pizza made me feel sluggish.  But I would wear out the spaghetti.  I started baking my foods in the '80s [1980s].  So I did baked foods, the wheat bread, things that I was not accustomed to.  Because you know, I was accustomed to greens, the cabbage, cornbread, pinto beans, and black eyed peas on the regular.  I rarely had that in college.  It was more of eating on that style of food that was served up that way.
Speaker 1: Did they try to influence your diet at all?  Did the coach [Leonard Braxton] try to influence what you were eating?
Speaker 2: Not at Morgan [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  His--that was the only thing that attracted me to Morgan.  He said, "If you can eat ham hocks and pig feet, and win the South, I'm not going to change the way you eat."  (Laughter) So, everyone loved crab legs.  And, you know, crabs--I have never seen that in my life.  I mean, they were selling them on the street corners and they were buying the bags, and crabs were crawling all over the kitchen.  I'm like these people are crazy around here, you know.  Where are the ham hocks, you know, and cornbread.  And on Friday nights they would buy pounds and pounds of, you know, crabs, and we'd have a little crab boil going on.  And I was so country.  I was like, "Oh, please, just get me some chicken," you know.  And the coach would have to go buy little country Rochelle [HistoryMaker Rochelle Stevens] some KFC [Kentucky Fried Chicken].  And we had a girlfriend who was from the Caribbean, and they wanted oxtails.  So he would have to go the hood, which that was most of Baltimore [Maryland] to me, and get her the oxtails.  And he would have to go to KFC and get me the chicken.  And everybody else was just pigging out on crabs. "Oh, you don't eat crabs?  Oh, cool."  All of them were fighting over my crab legs and everything.  So, diet was not a very important factor for me in college.  But it changed when I became older, just making sure I put in the foods that would cause me to have a higher energy level, and learning foods to stay away f- that caused you to be sluggish.  And so, it kind of started changing in the late '80s [1980s].
Story_ID: 290838
Speaker 1: Now, did you join a sorority or anything in--
Speaker 2: Not when I was in college [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  I wanted to, but at that time (background noise) in the '80s [1980s], you know, they were doing things that they were not supposed to be doing.  And the athletes were not able to perform as well because they were injured.  And we had so many injured people until it started affecting the performances of the teams.  And the athletic director came and announced that if you're on a scholarship at this school and you would like to pledge on the ground, above the ground, or on the ground, then you would pay your own way to school.  And we thought they were kind of joking, and I was like, "Shoot, I'm from Tennessee.  My mother [Beatrice Stevens Holloway] can't afford this out of state tuition."  So, I kind of just dropped that real quick.  But I still had teammates to pledge secretly, and once they pledged, they lost their scholarships.
Speaker 1: Now, they were sustaining injuries due to the hazing?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Of a sorority?
Speaker 2: And fraternities.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I was--okay.
Speaker 2: In fact--
Speaker 1: In fraternities, you can imagine.  But the sororities were hurting people physically?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: To the point where they couldn't perform?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: In fact, the organization I was interested in had just finished serving a seven-year probation.  So, and I would have been one of the lines that would probably have to make up for all the seven years that they missed.  (Laughter) And they used to, you know, swap with Howard University [Washington, D.C.] on the weekend.  So, with Howard not really knowing who you are, they didn't really care about you.  And so, the coach [Leonard Braxton] was like, "No way, no way."  And so, I just ended up doing it twenty years later-
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --pledging to a sorority.
Story_ID: 290839
Speaker 1: Did running (background noise) track cramp your social life any?  You know, did you have time to--
Speaker 2: We didn't have a social life in college [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], you just didn't.  We traveled, and we left most of the time on Thursday nights.  So that means you're missing class on Friday.  You miss Friday, you miss Saturday, and you get back Sunday at three A.M.  And you'd better be in that eight o'clock class on Monday.  So, when you get back, you're too busy trying to catch up on what you missed dealing with your school.  And we missed all the parties.  We'd get to hear about them, we missed all the parties.  We missed all the fun.  And to everyone else, they thought we were having fun, because they were looking at us like, "Wow, you all are going to Jamaica.  Wow, you all are going to Arizona."  Okay, we're smelling Bengay, and we're there all day, so it's not a vacation.  (Laughter) You got butterflies, you're nervous.  You're looking at people regurgitating everywhere.  That is not exciting.  We were on a van for fifteen, sixteen, twelve hours--not a chartered bus, but a van.  You know, no radio, the seats are not reclining, but we had a ball, we had fun.  We enjoyed those long rides, and I learned how to study on the van.  And I had teammates, they could not read with the van moving, it made their head hurt.  But I was able to take advantage of those ten, twelve hour bus rides and van rides and prepare papers on the van with fifteen other people.  They're cracking jokes, throwing toothpaste, you're eating, you're just--and I was able to study in the midst of all that chaos that was going on in the van.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, you say your grades were good?
Speaker 2: They were decent.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I made the dean's list twice.  And in fact, I earned an academic scholarship.  Because my GPA, I believe one semester I was leading for all of the athletes that finished with 3.68 GPA, and I started getting those academic scholarships.  So I would take the academic scholarships and pay for summer school because the athletic department did not pay for our summer school.  And I was like, "Well if I had went to Tennessee [University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee], they would have paid."  They said, "Well, guess what, this is not Tennessee."  So, you know, I found a way to get my summer school paid for, and my grades were able to pay for my summer school sessions.
Story_ID: 290840
Speaker 1: Okay now, were there any special teachers at Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland] that you remember that--or any other students you think are worthy of noting before I graduate you and get you into the [1988] Olympic trials?
Speaker 2: Were there any special teachers?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Teachers or students on the campus that you want to mention?
Speaker 2: Well, my senior year wasn't as complicated, especially the second semester of it.  Like I said, I had so many students that was giving me advice until it's kind of hard to even name them because I took advice from a lot of different people.  But I had taken up those summer school courses and had taken everything that I needed, until when the second semester rolled around they said, "You didn't take your electives."  And all I needed was nine credit hours my senior year in the second semester to graduate.  And I was like, "Electives, what is that?"  They said, "That's what people take their freshman year."  And so I didn't, I wasn't under all of that stress, like a lot of seniors were to graduate--trying to still pass the writing exam and pass the speech proficiency, still trying to pass those courses.  I had like CPR [cardiopulmonary resuscitation] and rifle and archery, salesmanship, those were my classes.  So, I was not under stress.  And I didn't really have any favorite teachers because none of those were in my major.  So, I didn't have anybody to just really keep encouraging me because I had made it to the mountaintop basically, nine hours.   And they said, "Well, you're not a full time student, you can't get your track scholarship."  So I had to pick up a couple other classes, which ended up being something like learning how to wrap the ankle, sports injury and prevention, which ended up paying off for me much later.  Because once I became a world-class athlete, and you don't have a personal trainer or athletic trainer to travel with you--no one knew how to tape ankles and take care of different injuries.  And I had that experience from taking that course.  I was able to wrap my own ankle, you know, with the pre-tape and the rest of it.  So, I enjoyed my senior year.  I was humming that graduation song every day because I wasn't sweating over passing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Just, I didn't ask you this.  But track season for you, you ran like indoor track and outdoor track, right?
Speaker 2: Cross-country.
Speaker 1: And cross-country.  So, that's fall--
Speaker 2: The whole--
Speaker 1: That's the whole year.
Speaker 2: The whole year.  And the NCAA's [National Collegiate Athletic Association] were always in June.  So, we would finish school the second week in May.  Everybody's going home, and you're still talking about practicing.  And that's where the discipline had to come in at.  Because everybody's now gone, and it's really boring.  It's just you and that hot track.  You don't have any classes to distract you.  You don't have anything but just the track.  And so, we ran the whole school term.
Speaker 1: Now, in the summertime did you get a little break from it?
Speaker 2: No, because I made those USA teams.  (Laughter) Come to think of it, I was in Europe in the summer competing for the East team at the National Sports Festival.  And so, I trained the whole time.  And the only time I would get off would be three to six weeks before school starts.  And we'd start right back over again with cross-country.  They used that for endurance for indoor season.  Because Morgan took indoors very seriously, because we raced a lot in Madison Square Garden [New York, New York] and in the Meadowlands [Sports Complex, East Rutherford, New Jersey], and that was big stuff.  And all those meets was always on television.  So, that was like high cotton. You're in college running in the Madison Square Garden, oh, this is big stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so, did you get like tired of it and say, "Oh, I'm tired of running."
Speaker 2: You just start getting tired towards the end of the year, just kind of burned out.  Because you didn't have any fun, you didn't get to hang out.  You missed all the ice cream, the cookies, the cake, the parties.  You didn't hang out with your friends.  You were just, you always had to focus, you always had butterflies, always nervous.  And so, I didn't really enjoy my youth life in my college.  And in fact, I didn't really enjoy much of it because I was always focusing, striving to be the best in the world.  And at that time I thought that was fun.  You know, my friends were like, "Oh, there she goes, doing another thousand sit-ups.  How many sit-ups you going to do today?"  "Oh, I'm just going to do a thousand."  And to me, that was intriguing.  So that was my reward, and especially when you're able to go to those competitions and win and set records, and you had accomplished what you set out to do.  And as I got older, I later found out that I really didn't miss anything.  And so I can really appreciate my life because it has always been clean cut--no drugs, no alcohol, never experienced, you know, different things that young ladies go through being young, from just date rapes and things that a lot of females go through.  I did not experience any of that, because we was focused.  We had a whole different agenda, and our thing was to accomplish what we set out to do.
Story_ID: 290841
Speaker 1: Now, you graduated in nineteen eighty--
Speaker 2: Eight [1988].
Speaker 1: --eight [1988]. And. Okay, so, all right.  Now, the summer or that spring, I don't know which one, you were trying out for the U.S. Olympics [1988 Summer Olympics, Seoul, South Korea].
Speaker 2: Summer.
Speaker 1: All right.  What happened?  Tell us about that.  Where you at when this happened?
Speaker 2: The Olympic trials were in Indianapolis [Indiana], and it was interesting.  It was a very long season, and my coach [Leonard Braxton] was nervous.  I mean he had produced a lot of stars, but he had not coached anyone to the Olympic trials, or to that level.  So he was like, "Well, you got all this speed.  And what we need to do is just get you a little bit stronger, like the way you were when you first came here."  And he took me back to like a base training to, you know, whatever the coach said, I was doing it.  And when I got to the trials--because he took me back to the base--and I had left all the speed, I was flat.  So when I got to the trials, I wasn't as sharp.  My muscles wasn't turning over, they were flat.  I was struggling through the races, and we didn't know why.  Because he took me back to a base training that you do at the beginning of the year when you're supposed to run slow versus keeping that tempo rolling.  And I struggled through the rounds.  And the rounds were supposed to be easy for me, but my speed was just gone.  It was a very hard Olympic trials.  And of course, Florence Griffith Joyner--she wasn't known as Flo Jo at that time.  She was so beautiful, and all those gorgeous suits, and stealing the show and breaking world records every day.  You were like, "Wow, look at her."  But in the back of your mind, you're like, "Gee, I'm over here running like I got two left feet."  And so the semifinals, they said the top four makes it to the finals.  And if you make it to the finals, everyone goes to Seoul, [South] Korea.  And I ran as best I could, and it just so happened there was a photo finish.  And you know, we was all celebrating and we was all jolly, "I made it, I made it, I made it."  And we didn't know that it was a protest going on from the competitor and her coach.  And they looked at the photo finish, and I was the first one at the line.  But they had the thing where they say, "Well, the next person's body that moves forward first is really the winner."  And according to their technology that was working, my body was not going to be the next thing moving forward.  So they announced an hour later that I was not in that final.  And so--
Speaker 1: So, they told you that had won, and then they told you an hour later that--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, because it was a protest.  And I never knew that it was a protest.  I had finished fourth in my heat.  And so, like I said, if you make the final you automatically go to Seoul, Korea.  So, we were just celebrating, "Yes, we got in, we got in."  But an hour later, they come back and they make that announcement.  And the companies or the people that were interested in sponsoring me, all of that just basically went out the window--sponsorships, donations.  In fact, your friends, they even went in the opposite direction.  They were looking at you like you had leprosy or something.  And it was one of the most embarrassing moments of my life.  I was so embarrassed, and I cried.  And my good friend, Denise [ph.], had experienced, you know, she had finished fifth in the heat just before me.  But our times were faster than some of the people that was in the other heat.  But since you didn't finish fourth--they didn't go off of time, they went off of place.  So you had people that made the [U.S.] Olympic team with slower times, but they just so happened to be in the right heat.  And we both sat behind this little building, and we both were just crying and boohooing.  I mean she was back there first.  And I saw her, and she was trying to congratulate me, and I was like, "I just didn't make it either."  And we both boohooed.  And then we tried to convince ourselves that, I didn't go to college to go to the Olympics.  I went to college to get a degree.  I graduated.  She said, "I graduated."  So, we was like, "Oh, at least we're smart, we're not dumb athletes.  We're not dumb." We tried to convince ourselves that we really went to college for a degree.  Okay, we did do that.  But as a childhood dream, that dream was to go to the Olympics.  And we both missed that team, and we boohooed and cried and cried.  And I was so embarrassed.  I didn't even want to walk to my hotel.  I was just embarrassed.  I felt like I let my coach down, my mom [Beatrice Stevens Holloway] down.  I just felt like I let everybody down.  And it was a sad moment.  You know, just talking about it, it's like, it's almost like reminiscing back to the pain that I felt from missing that team because that was a childhood dream, and I missed that Olympic team.  And I didn't think about trying out four years later.  I didn't know track operated the way it did.  I just thought that once you finished your college career, you're basically finished.
Story_ID: 290842
Speaker 1: Well so, what happened?  What did you do after you--?
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: This and that.  And okay, you've got the summer ahead of you.  Did you run other meets, or did you--?
Speaker 2: You're not invited to anything if you're not an Olympian.  (Laughter)  You're basically done, you're done.  And I put in the paperwork to go to San Diego State [University, San Diego California] to get a master's degree.  And some kind of way, the paperwork was lost, and so that was another form of depression.  And I came back to Memphis [Tennessee] and started looking for a job.  And my mom [Beatrice Stevens Holloway], you know, she was always there, you know, she was so proud of me.  She was just so proud that I was even at the [1988] Olympic trials, and she cried with me.  You know, she was like, "I'm so proud of you," you know, and to hear my mom say that.  You know, and I was scared to even face my younger sisters because I just felt like I let everybody down.  You know, they remember you racing people in the street, and you're blowing them out.  And now you're winning state titles and NCAA [National Collegiate Athletics Association] titles, and then you get to the Olympic trials and you don't make it.  So, that was like the worst day of my life.  I wish I could have just hid under a rock and never come out.  But I ended up coming back here, and I was only looking about sixteen years old of age.  And I couldn't get a job.  Everybody was like, "Well, why don't you try graduating from high school first?"  I was twenty-one years old when I graduated from Morgan [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], looking sixteen, maybe fifteen, and I had my little miniature degree in my pocket.  And then they slapped me with I didn't have five years of experience.  And five years of experience with a degree, that's what they were requiring.  I was like, that is really impossible.  And so I ended up working these nickel and dime jobs.  And I so happened to call this agent, and I really didn't know that he was an agent.  I didn't really know what he had to do.  You've seen the track clubs that we talked about earlier, the Pioneers [New York Pioneer Club] and the New York Club [New York Athletic Club].  And I just called just to be polite.  And I said, "Hello."  And he said, "Hey, girl."  His name was Kermit Foster, out of Virginia.  He said, "Are you going to run indoors?"  I'm like, "Oh, no, I'm finished, I'm retired.  I have hung up those shoes."  He said, "Oh, you can't do that.  You got to run indoors."  I was like, "Be for real.  What do I want to do that for?"  And that's when he, you know, said, "Hey, you're the NC [national championship] champion.  You have a name, and I can get you some appearance fees."  And I was like, "What?"  So, he introduced me to that.  And I was like, "Do I have to win?"  Because I knew I wasn't in shape.  And he was like, "Oh, no, you just show up."  And I started back to running, and the rest was basically history as to how the world class career started.  I was able to make a couple of thousand dollars off of running fifty-three, fifty-four seconds all slow.  (Laughter) I was like, "Whoa, this is better--."
Speaker 1: So they paid for the appearance fee?
Speaker 2: Well, the others was making even more.  But when you grew up not having a whole lot of money and then you go to college--and you're definitely not going to have any money there.  And you come back home, and the minimum wage is still [$]3.35, and you have a college degree and all they're offering is [$]5.25.  That was like two hundred dollars a week, and after Uncle Sam hit that, that's $160.  And I was like, I didn't go to college to make $160 a week, it's got to be a better way.  And when he introduced that to me--and my appearance fees was anywhere between a thousand and two thousand dollars a race, and I'm racing two or three times on the weekend, wow, where else am I going to make three to six thousand dollars in three days?
Speaker 1: So, that's good money, then.
Speaker 2: That was real good money.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Our, our, my family life changed because of Kermit Foster, and being able to compete on that world-class scene.
Story_ID: 290843
Speaker 1: Now how long was it before you realized that you could make the [U.S.] Olympic team again?
Speaker 2: Well, I was still hungry and disappointed.  So, that following year in '89 [1989] I was ranked number one in the U.S. in the 400 [meter].  And I was ranked fourth in the world.  And then that's when the other contracts came into play--Nike International and other companies were showing interest again.  You're number one in the whole U.S.A., wow.  That was a big deal.  And then in 1990, I was ranked number one in the U.S again.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the people you beat?
Speaker 2: Who were some of the people that I beat at that time?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was like Lillie Leatherwood, Jearl Miles [Clark], Natasha Kaiser-Brown, Sherri Howard, Diane Dixon, Denean Howard, Grace Jackson.  Flo Jo [Florence Griffith Joyner] even jumped over in the 400 a couple of times.  She was in the quarter-mile and she was visiting, but I beat Flo Jo.  And so, it was a hot race, it was really a hot race. 400 was really popular for the women at that time.  You just didn't walk into it and take over.  Because it was just like Carl Lewis was in the 100 [meter] dominating.  You just didn't come out and take over.  And fortunately for me, some of those athletes started having injuries.  They was getting a little bit older.  At that time if you were twenty-four or twenty-five running, they were like, "Oh, you're real old."  As time went on, and you started perfecting the sport, athletes now hang until thirty-five and thirty-eight years old now in track and field, competing on a world class level.  So, it was some tough competition out there.
Story_ID: 290844
Speaker 1: So, in 1992, you tried out again for the Olympic Games the Barcelona Games [1992 Summer Olympics, Barcelona, Spain], right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What happened, and where were those trials held?
Speaker 2: Those trials were held in New Orleans [Louisiana].  And I went there, you know, with all the thoughts of, you missed that last Olympic team.  And I went into the U.S. Olympic trials, and I was ranked number one in the world.  Not just U.S. at that time, I had the fastest time in the world.  I was leading, I was leading the grand prix and all of that good stuff that goes along with it.  But it was still in the back of my mind that I had missed that last team, and I can't let that happen this time.  And I took every round seriously.  We made sure we didn't go back to a base training, either.  My mother [Beatrice Stevens Holloway] made sure we did plenty of speed work.  We didn't want to make the same mistake that we had made four years earlier.
Speaker 1: We didn't, we didn't cover this.  But your mother at this point is your coach, right?
Speaker 2: My mother started training me.
Speaker 1: How did that happen?  How did that take place, and when did that start?
Speaker 2: It started when I called Kermit [Foster], and he was telling me to get in shape and start training, et cetera.  And I knew that I didn't want to go back to Baltimore [Maryland] because that was the only coach I knew.  And then I found my age group coach that convinced me, "You're going to see Tony Wakefield."  So, Tony actually started coaching me the first year of the world class.  And of course, my mom was out there every day.  But I figured if he was the person that developed me originally, he would be the person to take me to that next plateau.  And I won my first U.S.A. national title with Tony, outdoor title.  And that's when I was fourth in the world and number one.  And after that, his work schedule had gotten so full he didn't have time to train me.  And my mom was like, "You can't stay world class half training."  And so, I said, "Well, why don't you train me?"  And she went, "Oh, no, be for real.  This is your livelihood.  Please, be for real."  And I looked at my mom, and I said, "I want you to train me because you are the one that discovered me, and you really know me."  And I'm always trying to impress my mother.  I don't care if she was at practice, I always wanted to do well in front of my mom.
Story_ID: 290845
Speaker 1: Your mother [Beatrice Stevens Holloway] is training you, and you want to impress your mother.  And your mother has watched Tony [Wakefield], what he did.  I mean, did she improvise anything different from what Tony Wakefield was doing?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.  She cranked up that workout.  It was, everything was faster.  We had to do everything a whole lot faster.  She was, we started studying together.  I started sending her to--with me being ranked number one in the U.S.A. track and field would send for your coach, and they would put them in workshops.  And they would analyze the athlete and put them through a computer module and say, "Well, this is the computer on a world record, and this is your athlete," and they start out together.  So, she was able to go to intensified training with some of the other world class coaches, and they would be locked up for a week or two.  And all they would do is look at film and video as to, "Well, your athlete's body is leaning back. If you notice, the model is still standing tall."  And we were like, "Okay, that is a computer.  It doesn't breathe, it's not breathing.  So, don't expect me to run like this here thing."  But she would bring all of that information back, and we would study it and put strategies together.  And then I always talked to other athletes that were just incredible.  I would talk to Butch Reynolds, who was the world record holder in the 400 [meter dash].  I would talk to Steve Lewis, who had won a medal in the Olympics [1988 Summer Olympics, Seoul, South Korea].  And these were quarter milers.  And I would say, "Well, what kind of workout did you do Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday?"  And they're like, "Try this, you'll love it."  And the next thing you know I have workouts from Butch Reynolds, workouts from Steve Lewis, workouts from Kevin Young.  And I would get all of these world class athletes who were my friends and colleagues, mostly males.  And we would take it back and we would look at their workouts, and we would try to see what would be a fit for me.  And we ran into this coach named Stan [Huntsman], out of California.  And he trained Lee Evans.  And so, we took a lot of his workouts and just put it together, and we kind of made myself like a research.  But I trained at 110 percent.  I gave everything that I had every single day.  My mother would have to all but carry me to the car, or drag me to the car.  I never sat in the front seat.  I was always just stretched out in the back seat because my body would just lock up, I would leave it at the track every single day.  And that's how our workouts consisted.  And if it was cold, she'd have on a fur coat and everything, and I'm out there still working out.  If it rained, she had her umbrella.  It did not make a difference, we did not miss training.  And I was just that hungry to be the best in the world.  Whatever it took as far as training, eating right, getting plenty of sleep, which I still get, ten or twelve hours--I did just that, because I wanted to be the best.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there any--when they studied your technique and your form, was there any major flaw that you had to correct?
Speaker 2: Just make sure you finish.  You know, the model never got tired.  (Laughter) So, we just worked on having a stronger finish, and making sure your knees are still up, and your head is a certain way, and your elbows are in.  And so, with us focusing on that, we started focusing and training towards that.  In fact, it ended up helping, because in '92 [1992], where you're normally fatigued, we had trained a certain way until when I got to that section, my body was trained to re-shift another gear and finish a whole lot stronger than I had in the past.  Because I was known to take it out like I'm the rabbit of my own race, and you might catch me.  But we later became the rabbit of the race, and now I even had a strong finish, a stronger finish than what I used to have.  So, we studied a lot of the competitors and foreign athletes and looked at their running style to see when did they pick up?  When did they slow down?  How did she run forty-nine seconds?  What did she do?  And I would watch tapes for hours on my own, just studying my, my competitors.  And that's how I became a student of my own sport.
Story_ID: 290846
Speaker 1: Who was the best in your races other than yourself when you were running?
Speaker 2: Marie Perec [Marie-Jose Perec] from France.  And we had Olha Bryzhina from Russia, or was she from Germany [sic. Ukraine]?  She was from Germany.  You had--if you was Russian, if you was German, if you were from Bulgaria, you was automatically good.  They were in those Communist countries where they were raised and bred and selected to be athletes at birth, and was basically--we used to call it [Vladimir] Putin coal mines, you know.  They was steroid babies, they were like projects.  Just like when [Adolf] Hitler had his athletes out there, they were strong and tough because they trained strictly for that.  It's like if you don't perform, we will just take out your whole family.  It was, we don't know how true all of that was.  We felt that when they stepped out there, they had vengeance to run, you're running to save your life, or you're running to get your family out of our concentration camp.  Or, like with the Cuban athletes, they were winning, and you'd get a refrigerator for your reward, or a stove.  And from my understanding, that was a big deal.  And so, they had a whole completely different motivation to compete, versus most American athletes.  We just had the desire to, you know, go to the Olympics, whereas their desire was they needed a refrigerator or a stove, or their parents are in some camp.  Theirs was more of a depression type thing, they were forced into the sport.   And so, it was just completely different to compete against them.  And I felt that if I can stay anywhere close to them, I will be an awesome athlete, if I could just stay close to them.  That means your time will get faster.
Story_ID: 290847
Speaker 1: In the early '90s [1990s] they were starting to talk about steroid use, and several athletes were accused of it.  And it became like an issue, like an international kind of issue.  What's your perspective on that, and what was going on?
Speaker 2: Well, technically, you know, when Ben Johnson was busted in 1988 in Seoul, Korea [at the 1988 Summer Olympics, Seoul, South Korea], I mean the world was shocked.  I mean he was the first major icon to get caught.  And I guess it kind of slowed all the other folks down from taking this.  It was like, "Whoa, if they got Ben Johnson, I know they're going to get me."
Speaker 1: Now, Ben Johnson ran for Canada.
Speaker 2: He ran for Canada.
Speaker 1: And he beat--
Speaker 2: Carl Lewis.
Speaker 1: Carl Lewis.
Speaker 2: I mean, he blew him out.
Speaker 1: And Carl Lewis was shocked, and people were watching that.
Speaker 2: The whole world was shocked.
Speaker 1: It seemed as though Ben Johnson had muscles in his ears and everywhere.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) So, it kind of started with that trend.  And in the '90s [1990s], some of the top athletes were busted.  One of them was in my race.  Her name was, wow, I can't think of her name.  She was in all of the races.  And they caught Kathleen Kravos [ph.], she was number one in the world in the 100 [meter] and 200 [meter].  And they caught the top 800 meter runner.  And then like I said, the 400 meter, Britt Brewer [ph.], she was sixteen, fifteen, running 49 seconds in the 400, just stocky, you know, just stocky.  And all three of them were caught in '91 [1991] before '92 [1992 Summer Olympics] in [Barcelona] Spain.  They all had the same specimen.  And so, all of them were busted.  And of course, we celebrated, "Yes, that's one less person I got to worry about in Barcelona [Spain]."  (Laughter) But I never felt sorry for any of the athletes that cheated.  I used to really wish something bad would happen to them, so that it could send a wakeup call for the others to stop cheating.  You know, I could have cared less if you had a heart attack.  When you train and bust your butt and you do everything that you need to do, and you know someone else done took shots and popped pills and didn't properly train, that's a conflict of interest.  And then they're whipping you up on the track as if you didn't do any training.  So, it was like, I wish she would pass out.  Or, I don't want her to have a heart attack, but just pull a muscle, tear it up.  You didn't lift weights, and your body looks better than Arnold Schwarzenegger.  You know, the women at that time, especially the Germans and the Russians, all of them were 5'9", 5'10", six feet tall.  Muscles were just put in place.  They had sideburns, they had mustaches, they had beards, they had hair on their chest, they had stuff growing that ain't supposed to be growing because you know, they was on so many enhancing drugs.  And they was never caught, because their countries would not send them out unless they could detect that they can pass the drug test, just in case they get tested.  But they didn't have to worry about getting tested, because I was the one getting selected.  I tested eighteen times in one summer.  Every time I stepped on the track, I was selected.  So it started to become frustrating because you look at the Russian man that just beat you, and the Spanish man that's got sideburns, and they was never tested.  And I was like, "Why don't you test that man?  I'm getting sick of you all testing me."  Which I didn't have a problem with it, I knew I was clean, but test some of these people that's looking like a man, you know.  (Laughter) You can't get busted if you don't get tested, and that's what I kind of found out, that you're not going to get busted if they're not testing you.  And I was always the one getting tested.  So, I made the sport look good.  Because when they said all the athletes we tested were clean, I made the sport look good.
Story_ID: 290848
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety-two [1992], the trials in New Orleans [Louisiana].  Now, you, you, you made it?
Speaker 2: I won the trials, in fact (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)You won, okay.
Speaker 2: It was, it was something.  In fact, the semi-finals in New Orleans, and it had to be deja vu.  The same ladies that was in my heat in 1988 were in my league four years later.  I had the same identical heat.  And I had the outside lane with the fastest time.  So, that means I can't even watch them, they're all watching me.  And when I looked behind me and I saw who all was on the track--because I never look at who's in my race the night before.  I don't want to think about you, I want to sleep.  I know I got to race you, so no need of me thinking about you, let me just sleep.  And when I saw who I had to race, tears came to my eyes, and I was like, "Not today.  I am not missing this team today."  You know, I literally had tears in my eyes.  And I looked in the stands at my mom [Beatrice Stevens Holloway], and I looked at my godmother, and she was a '56 Olympic [1956 Summer Olympics, Melbourne, Australia] bronze medalist, and once hit the American record in the broad jump, Margaret Matthews Wilburn.  And she gave me that nod, you know, that look, like "Let's go."  You know, it was just so much pressure, and it was like I am not missing this team.  I ran so fast.  In fact my mom told me, "If you don't make this team, I'm going to whip you all the way back to Memphis [Tennessee].  I'm going to get my switch, and I'm going to whip that butt all the way back to Memphis."  Okay, I still believed my mother.  I don't know if I was more scared of my mother or if I was afraid of my competitors.  But I ran my lifetime best in the semifinals.  And the press said, "Why did you run so fast?"  And I said, "It was revenge."  And they said, "If today was revenge, what's the finals going to be?"  I said, "It's going to be payday."  And I walked off not knowing that it would be quoted all in the paper, and people rolling their eyes at me, and now I'm looking extra arrogant.  And my mother said, "Did you see what all you said in the paper?  Well, that's why everybody's rolling their eyes."  (Laughter) But I ended up, you know, winning the Olympic trials.  And it was just a great feeling to be able to know that I had missed that team by a photo-finish and basically gave up on going out for the Olympics again, and then to come back four years later and to be number one in the world.
Story_ID: 290849
Speaker 1: So, this dream deferred is now yours, and you're on your way to Barcelona [Spain], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay now, Barcelona is, that's where they had some big drama on the international level, right?
Speaker 2: That was Atlanta [Georgia], with the bomb.
Speaker 1: Atlanta, okay.
Speaker 2: I don't really remember anything--
Speaker 1: Nothing in Barcelona, okay.
Speaker 2: Nothing major.  But the experience in Barcelona, you know, it was beautiful.  They had a beautiful setting for us [Olympians at the 1992 Summer Olympics, Barcelona, Spain].  It was out on the ocean, and you had a beach, and you had everything--bowling, nightclubs.  How was I supposed to focus?  Because you have all of this stuff.  We had, I mean they had the boardwalks.  And up the boardwalks, you had drink machines, and all you had to do was just push the button and drink.  You didn't have to pay for anything.  If you're hungry, you just walk up and get your food, twenty-four hours.  Snack machines, you got candy.  Just push the button like a kid, and stuff would just fall out.  Oh, it was just incredible.
Speaker 1: It was different from East Germany?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, whenever you got to the Olympics, everyone has to make that impression.  And they're serving food for every nationality.  You know, if you like Italian, if you like, you know, sushi, if you like--so they had things for everybody.  And they were able to accompany--you know, we don't eat nothing but chicken and pasta, right?  But it was, it was beautiful when you first got there.  And then you start looking at the faces of the athletes, and everybody just started getting in these zones.  You know, you're now focusing, like, now, I'm at the Olympics.  I don't have time to be cracking jokes and talk to you and play games.  Everybody was so focused.  And now you can just feel the intensity in the air.  And it was so hot in Barcelona.  And the dorms, they were brand new, but you know, they're not nothing we're accustomed to staying in.  They didn't have air conditioning, so we're in 98 to 100-and-something degrees every day, and you don't have air.  We didn't even have fans.  And all you could think is people at home, when they see Barcelona on TV, they see all this beautiful landscape and beautiful everything, and we're here suffering.  No telephones, no air-conditioning, no television, no cable.  You know, a dorm with a twin-sized bed that's too short with your feet hanging all out.  The basketball players--that was the first year of the Dream Team.  They took them to hotels, because they didn't have beds long enough for me, so you know they didn't have beds long enough for Charles Barkley and Michael Jordan and Patrick Ewing and Magic [Johnson].  And so, that was the Dream Team.  We were like, "The Dream Team's going to be in the village.  We going to get to meet the Dream Team."  Yeah, right.  The Dream Team was in a five-star hotel still rolling around in limos.  We were the only ones suffering in the heat, you know.  You didn't even take hot showers, you took cold showers just to keep cool.  Everybody's now grumpy, you're agitated, you're irritable.  You go to bed, you wet a towel, and you put this big, wet towel on your body.  And that's how you had to keep cool.  You'd take your bottle of water and you'd put it under your bed, and that's how you could cool off with water.  Because there was no ice, no ice, that didn't even exist.  And it was just miserable.  And you're there ten long days.
Speaker 1: Nobody at home would have ever guessed that.  I mean I saw it on television, and I never--
Speaker 2: It was beautiful, wasn't it?  (Laughter) We were miserable.  So you know, if you're hot and you're miserable, then you're grumpy and you're uptight.  And so, the Olympic Committee ended up shipping seven hundred fans to our villages.  So, we had a fan.  Oh, a fan was your best friend.  (Laughter) But the way you really kept cool, like I say, is you wet those towels and you lay with a wet towel over your whole body, and the fan is kind of just cooling you off.  But you're still just--the only places that were cool was like when you go to eat, and you couldn't just hang out in there all day.  But everything else was just hot, hot all day.  You're taking showers about ten times a day just to cool off.  And the intensity, like I said, the intensity was there and the thought of, wow, I'm finally at the Olympics.  And your pressure goes up, your nerve pressure goes up at least two hundred, to the two hundredth power, if it was one.  You know, you have the tenth power, and we were like the two hundredth power.  And it's, oh, it was the most pressured time ever.  I mean, you don't know if you're going to have a heart attack or a stroke.  You're so scared.  You just--you couldn't comb your hair right, you couldn't zip your clothes up right, you're running extra early and you don't know where your pants are, there's no phones to communicate.  It was just a whole lot to deal with.  And I never been so nervous in my life.  I wasn't that nervous even at the Olympic trials, like I was in Barcelona.  And once you got that first race out the way, it got a little bit better.  And each night when people come back to the village, they either come back with a gold medal, silver or bronze.  You're looking like, "Wow, they won a medal."  Or they come back, and especially if they're in a sport-they're limping or they got a black eye or they got the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you-
Speaker 2: --busted lip--
Story_ID: 290850
Speaker 1: How many roommates did you have [at the 1992 Summer Olympics, Barcelona, Spain]?
Speaker 2: I had, I believe it was eight to our suite.  And the rooms had to be about 8 x 6 [feet], smaller than a dorm room.  It was just twin-sized beds and that's it.  No pictures, no curtains, no nothing--just the mattress and a pillow, and they gave you your sheets.  I was like, this looks like prison, you know.  (Laughter) It didn't seem like I was going to be staying in a five-star hotel.  They don't prep you on things like that.  And you got eight suite mates all in this--
Speaker 1: It seems, it sounds as if the Olympic provisions were a lot less than what you were used to on the track circuit?
Speaker 2: Right, because on the circuit you're staying in five-star hotels.  But when you're accommodating ten thousand athletes--those buildings were brand new, so it wasn't like they were, you know, too bad.  But they built them according to their custom.  They didn't really use air-conditioning in Spain, so we were hot.  And this coach by the name of John Smith, who trained some other Olympic medalists, gold and world record holders, he said, "Ro [HistoryMaker Rochelle Stevens], they're going through the same conditions you're going through--the Russians, the Germans, everybody.  Nobody has special perks or privileges."  He said, "So, don't let this hot room get to you.  Just know they're going through the same conditions you are."  And with him just making that comment I stopped complaining, and it was like okay, they hot, too.  But then we were like, "They're used to being hot.  They don't have air-conditioning anyway."  (Laughter) But I still put that behind me and looked at it as, you're not going to beat me.  I'm not going to let this hot room or this hot weather bring me down because you're sleeping in the heat too.  You're eating the same foods I'm eating.  I just started putting it into that perspective, and I was able to halfway re-focus at the games in Barcelona [Spain].  But I ended up finishing sixth in the open 400 in lane one.  And I think the worst I was supposed to finish was maybe third, but I never had lane one.  I always had lane six, seven, or eight.  And it was, I know I couldn't have been too focused because I actually saw the cameras as we was sprinting around the track.  And you've got eighty-five thousand spectators and people taking pictures.  I actually saw cameras flashing.  I knew I was not focused if I was able to see people flashing those cameras.  And it's like, I'm not going to ever catch up those girls.  And so I was like, I'll just run for time, not knowing that it was four of us all running for the bronze.  And when we all leaned, they had to come back, and those times were so close.  All I know is I got sixth place.  And my mom [Beatrice Stevens Holloway] was on the practice field waiting on me, and I cried because I was embarrassed.  I got sixth place.  I went in there with the fastest time in the world.  You get sixth place, okay, you're sixth in the world.  That sounds so good.  But to actually get sixth place, oh, it was horrible (laughter) to tell somebody that.
Speaker 1: That's one race.  You ran in how many races?
Speaker 2: We had to run rounds.  We had to eliminate athletes every day.  Again, we had four rounds, and I was the only American to make the finals.  And so, that was a big deal to just make it to the finals.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you got sixth place in the--
Speaker 2: In the finals.
Speaker 1: In the 400 [meter] finals?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, in the 400 finals.
Speaker 1: Now, you ran the 4 x 400 [relay], too, right?
Speaker 2: And I was the anchor leg for the 4 x 400, and Olha Bryzhina of Russia [Soviet Union] out-powered me the last thirty or forty meters of the race.  But the plan was to give me a big enough lead so I could get away from her.  But my lead was one step.  That's not a lead when this is the same person that Flo Jo [Florence Griffith Joyner] couldn't catch four years earlier.  And you know, Flo Jo, she ran like a forty-eight [second] 400 meter split and Olha forty-seven [seconds].  So, forty-seven will catch a forty-nine any day.  Give me a big, big, big, lead.  I got a one-step lead.  (Laughter) I was determined that I was going to run her to the line.  You know, I was thinking about Orange Mound [Memphis, Tennessee], I was thinking about where I was from.  I'm like, "I'm from Orange Mound, you know."  I'd give her that elbow and cut in front of her.  Because technically, she was in front of me, but technically I just kind of ran a little dirty and gave her that cute little elbow and got in front of her.  And interestingly, she was the person that I had studied for eight months because I was trying to figure out what was her running style, to run forty-seven [seconds].  And when you pull that tape and watch the race with us, we shift gears in the same place.  We were the same stride.  She was right behind me.  It was like as if she was marking me.  But in my mind, I had saw her in my mind for six months, and we moved in the same places, except she out-powered me at the end.  That was the only thing.
Story_ID: 290851
Speaker 1: So, you won the silver medal [in the 4 x 400 meter relay at the 1992 Summer Olympics, Barcelona, Spain]?
Speaker 2: Got the silver medal.  And on that relay was Natasha Kaiser-Brown, Jearl Miles [Clark], and Gwen Torrence.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we got the silver and came home, and I was so proud.  Memphis [Tennessee] gave me a parade like I was a Super Bowl, NBA [National Basketball Association] champion.  (Laughter) They had the big float and people came out, thousands came out and thousands showed up at the airport.  And I was like, wow, you know.  And that's when stardom really hit, you know, having bodyguards start protecting you, and people--
Speaker 1: Were people really, I mean, you needed a bodyguard at that point?
Speaker 2: I didn't think so.  But when you get up and you got people sleeping on your front lawn like you're Elvis Presley and just want to wave at you, "Hey," I got scared.  You start getting, you get scared.  And you go to the mall and everybody know you, and out of the blue, "Where's your medal?"  You don't know now if you're going to get robbed, mugged, or kidnapped.  And it really did get scary.  You make appearances and you're there to sign autographs, and you got all these other pretty women there, and all the guys are there for just you.  Nobody looks good, everybody's trying to get to the star.  And that's, it's like, whoa, now I see what Michael Jordan and some of the other athletes were actually, you know, going through.  Because you're like, oh, Michael Jordan's coming to town, and everybody wanted to meet Michael Jordan.  Every female in the whole city wants to meet that icon, and they want to be able to meet them.  And it had reversed.  And so, it had gotten pretty scary, and the sheriff's department here had decided to sponsor me.  And whenever I made appearances, for at least five years they sponsored me, and I was protected with the sheriff's department here, Shelby County Sheriff's Department.  And a lot of them sometimes would be undercover, but they would look like they were my date.  And I thought about the movie, 'The Bodyguard'."  And so, I had Rick [ph.] that protected me most of the time, and Freddy [ph.] would travel with me.  And so, in a word, people would say, "Dog, is it that serious, you got bodyguards?" (Laughter) But to me, I didn't think it was that serious, but you just don't know what's on the minds of people.
Speaker 1: Now, so you didn't need them when you went out of town because--
Speaker 2: I started taking them to the nationals, especially when they had the incident with Nancy [Kerrigan] and Tonya Harding.  And she was attacked and hit in the knee with the bat and all of that.  And come to find out, Tonya Harding had hit Nancy Kerrigan in her knee.
Speaker 1: They hired a guy to--
Speaker 2: Well, whoever, they did it.  We figured that some track athletes might decide to take out my knee.  And the sheriff's department was like, "Oh, we can't have that happening."  So they started sending them to at least the national championships for me, to make sure I had protection there.
Speaker 1: So, did you stay in the same neighborhood, or did you have to move or something?
Speaker 2: I stayed in the same neighborhood.  But I had the sheriffs kind of, you know, patrolling my house a whole lot more than they normally would.  Because like I said, you have people that's just camping out, wanting your autograph, wanting to take a picture of you, or wanting to throw you kisses, "I love you."  Oh, my gosh, who is this? You know, the things that you see on television, and to actually see it happen to you for real, is--it was really scary, it was scary.  You just don't know what to expect.
Story_ID: 290852
Speaker 1: Now, you came behind the Flo Jo [Florence Griffith Joyner] era where Flo Jo was the, I guess the fashion, was--had a--was making a fashion statement out of the different colored leggings and the long fingernails and all that sort of thing.  Were you tempted to do some of that, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, most of us had long nails and we, most had long hair, weaved hair, and braids.  But we didn't think about the one leg, you know.  We thought about looking cute and sexy, and I always ran with makeup on.  And my college coach [at Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], Coach [Leonard] Braxton, would say, "Well, if we don't win, at least we look good."  So we started putting that into our heads like, okay, I didn't win, but at least I'm looking good.  I was cute.  And so, we all was working on being cute.  But she really stole the show with those awesome suits, and then she was beautiful and she was so classy and breaking world records.  I mean, every man in the world I believe dreamed of Flo Jo.  And I'll never forget, we was in the 200 [meter] race, and we all had to come across this little grass field.  And we had gotten dirt under our spikes, you know, like some little mud.  And this guy was up under the tent, and he was like, "Oh, no, please, please, let me help you."  And he took all the dirt away from under her shoe and he was putting it into a sandwich bag, like, "This dirt came from Flo Jo's shoes."  You know, it was like, "I got dirt."
Story_ID: 290853
Speaker 1: All right so, you're about twenty-five years old I guess at this point? Twenty--
Speaker 2: Twenty-five.
Speaker 1: Twenty-five, yeah.  And so, are you looking forward to the next Olympic Games now?  Or what are you thinking at this point?
Speaker 2: Well, since we didn't win the gold--as people say, "You got to go for the gold, you got to go for the gold."  So, now you're striving four years later, and then it happens to be in the U.S.  So, you know, you want to run in front of the home crowd.
Speaker 1: That's the Atlanta Olympics [1996 Summer Olympics, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Hot-lanta.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Hot-lanta.  And so that was the thing, to be able to make the team.  And I had so many injuries between there--a broken jaw, pulled hamstring--
Speaker 2: A broken jaw?  How did you break your jaw running?
Speaker 1: You know, we had an ice storm here, and in the South we're not accustomed to snow and ice.  And I'm trying to keep my groceries from busting out the bag.  I'm still trying to catch all the juice, didn't want it to break.  And the next thing you know, the bags and I both went down, and my face hit the concrete and cracked the front of the jaw.  So I tried to train wired, couldn't even talk at all.  And my mom [Beatrice Stevens Holloway] still was running me as if I was not wired.  But I ended up being anemic that year and knees and things buckling.  Then I had a serious hamstring pull, just from being overworked the year before trying to make the Olympic teams.  And then I started developing Achilles problems and oh, it was just so many injuries, back to back.  And so, my racing started becoming a bit more mental, where I would have to mentally psych myself over the pain that I was going through.  And a lot of people never knew that I was injured, but that's the part where I stopped enjoying running track.  Because I just got tired of being injured, and I got tired of taking my mind to that level of not being injured.  But I made the '96 [1996] team.  I finished fourth in the trials with two Achilles that was just shot.  And no one, didn't know other than the trainers that was there.
Story_ID: 290854
Speaker 1: Did they rupture?  Did you rupture both of them?
Speaker 2: They said I had worn out the Achilles [tendon], and that they were not going to snap or pop, because I had basically worn them out.  So, I was wearing four inch heels to the track meet, to help keep the Achilles off the ground.  And I would see the trainers three or four times a day, getting ultra-sounds and ice.  And you couldn't really take a whole lot of anything but Aleve or Tylenol because everything was on our banned list for drugs and medications.  We couldn't even take Alka-Seltzer, or Pepto-Bismol.  All that stuff was on the banned list.  Can you believe that? Pepto. And so, no one knew but my mother [Beatrice Stevens Holloway] that I was in Atlanta [Georgia] with two bad Achilles.  And I was taped, they never knew it.  And one day we was training.  And I always got up and trained about 5:30 in the morning, because it was so hot.  And it started raining, and it was at least six days before the 4 x 400 [meter relay] came around.  And whenever it rained, the Achilles would really flare up.  And I was out there doing some wind sprints and it started raining, and it felt like somebody took some bricks and just slammed them on my Achilles.  So, I believe they erupted then.  And I hopped off that track, oh, my gosh, I didn't want anybody to see me.  You know, the other athletes were with their trainers and things, and I was under that tent.  And I was just in so much pain.  I was crying and just holding both Achilles, didn't know what to do.  I really was doing a whole lot of icing.  And I knew that if it was going to rain in the finals of the 4 x 400, I was going to let the coaches know, I'm not gonna run.  Because I'd rather for my team to win a medal than for me to be selfish and know that I'm injured and take that chance of the rain causing those things to flare up again.  I mean everybody is, they get sad when they see somebody pop a hamstring or something, you get sad.  But I didn't want them to get sad, I wanted us to still have that chance to get a medal.  But it didn't rain, I was so happy.  It wasn't even cloudy.  And I was strong enough to run as long as it didn't, you know, rain.  I was taped up and everything.  But I did not enjoy the Atlanta race.  To me, my race wasn't where it needed to be, for the simple fact I didn't know if I was going to be able to run.  And so my career just started going downhill like that, with those injuries just steady getting worse, because I had never had a chance to let the body properly heal.
Speaker 1: Oh, really?
Speaker 2: I was compensating.
Speaker 1: In the Olympics [1996 Summer Olympics, Atlanta, Georgia], though, you won a gold medal for the 4 x 400 team, right?
Speaker 2: I was the first leg.
Speaker 1: First leg, okay.
Speaker 2: I was the first leg.
Speaker 1: Did you do a decent time?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't think so.  You know, when they finally come back and they give you your splits--and I'm so accustomed to, you know, being the one, being the go-getter.  And I was, I couldn't tell because I was in the back lane.  And when I looked at the tape I think we got the stick in the third when I gave off the stick, and that was just so not me.  And you know, limping off that track, and we had to work really hard.  We was predicted to get the bronze medal in '96 [1996] anyway.  But, you know, I could have cared less what the predictions were.  All I know was that I was just praying that I would be healthy enough to be able to run with the injuries because if you don't run, you don't get your bonus.
Speaker 1: Who was the anchor leg?
Speaker 2: Jearl Miles [Clark] was the anchor.  So, I gave the baton to Maicel Malone, and she gave it off to Kim Graham. And Jearl had to fight with nails and tooth to beat the Nigerian team who was predicted to win.  And Jearl out-leaned her at the line.  And you know, we celebrated, and that next day I was half walking.  They still never knew it.  I had my high heels on.  I couldn't walk when I got out the bed because the Achilles were not warmed up.  You have to kind of scoot and slide until that part of the Achilles warmed up.  And so, they never knew that.
Speaker 1: Now, is this the kind of injury that could actually impair your ability to walk?
Speaker 2: Well, not permanently, but yeah.  You have a lot of, you have older guys that say they still got it, and they would go out and play basketball, a pick-up game of basketball.  And every time they get injured, that's what goes out on them, is their Achilles.  They don't hardly get that hamstring pulled, but it's the stress from the Achilles connected to the foot.  And a lot of guys end up popping their Achilles when they step back out there.  So, it was very, very painful, you know, just thinking--and four years from now, I'll be a little bit older, and I don't think I want to be running track, this--you know, that long.  I got to win, I got to get a medal in this country.  I don't care what happens.
Story_ID: 290855
Speaker 1: So, what was it like to get the gold medal in the [at the 1996 Summer Olympics, Atlanta, Georgia]--? And now, this, this is strange kind of, because you ran better before, but you didn't get the gold.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And here, you kind of limp into this one, and then get a gold medal.  Does it cause you to be philosophical about life, or what?
Speaker 2: Well, the thing is, all I can think is all my life this is what I've been chasing after.  This is what I've always wanted, was to win a gold medal for my country.  And when my sister Catherine [Holloway] had died in 1989 of a brain tumor, you know, right before she died I had told her I was going to win a gold medal for her.  And the press kind of brought that up, like, hey, you won this medal for your sister, and what does it feel like to win a gold medal for your sister and for your family?  And it was just the most incredible moment.  It was history that night, to be able to win and knowing that you're injured.  And you know, it was just incredible.  And to mention, I had this cosmetic make-up sponsorship at that time.  I was a Posner girl, and they were promoting mascara to see, to make sure the mascara didn't run.  And so, it was like I was this perfect model.  I was sweating and it was a 100-and-something degrees outside, and my makeup is still flawless.  My eye shadow and things were not running.  I didn't have purple sweat and blue sweat and things.  And I had told the president of the company--I had negotiated a bonus.  I said, "If you all pay me this bonus, I can prove that your makeup is not going to run."  You know, they was like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah," and they fell for it.  And when I was on that award stand, I just thought about all the hard work and the years that was put into it, and I started crying on the awards stand.  You know, the tears was just rolling.  And the Jumbotron was on, and I'm like rocking.  You know, I was all emotional, and no mascara was running.  So it was an extra good race for me, considering I got paid the bonus because their makeup didn't run on national television during the awards ceremony.  They was like, "Wow, she tricked us,"  (laughter).
Speaker 1: So what happened?  Did they have a bigger parade when you came back to Atlanta [Georgia] this time?
Speaker 2: We had more people from the mid-South to make the Olympic team the second time around.  Penny Hardaway was on the Dream Team this time.  Nikki McCray was from the suburbs of Memphis [Tennessee], Collierville [Tennessee].  She was on the women's basketball team, and they won a gold.  And then we had Cindy Parlow [Cone], who's from the suburbs of Memphis, which was Germantown [Memphis, Tennessee], and she was on the soccer team.  So, we came back with four gold medals.  And the city just honored all of us at the same time downtown.  And the county and city mayors gave us proclamations and keys to the city, you know.  But everybody was more excited for them, because that was their first Olympics and they was more like, "You've before, so it's no big deal."  I was like, "Shoot, but I got the gold medal."  And it is not an easy thing to make the Olympic team.  And when you do the history on it, only forty-four or forty-three Americans won gold medals.  So, when you have ten thousand athletes and only one hundred and some medals are going to be given out that are gold and you're one of them, it's more than, "You didn't do anything."  And so, I had to kind of just overlook, you know, people because they truly don't understand the commitment, the dedication, the hard work, the sacrifice, the pain, the agony, the disappointments, the lack of sponsorship.  They just don't have a clue what you go through to achieve a dream.
Story_ID: 290856
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now that you've won a gold medal [at the 1996 Summer Olympics, Atlanta, Georgia], you're back in Memphis [Tennessee].  But you've sustained all these injuries that are starting to build up.  What were you thinking then?  Did you--were you thinking you were going to keep running for a while?  Or did you think, well, what am I going to be--?
Speaker 2: I was engaged to be married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I figured it was time to have some, a relay team, six kids.  At thirty, yeah, right.  Four kids and two extras for the relay (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well tell us, where did you meet your husband?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't end up getting married, but I was engaged.  I was thinking I was going to start that new life, and it didn't happen.  He played for the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama].  He was a football star, and, but we didn't get married.  So, my friends call me the runaway bride.  (Laughter) And we didn't get married, but I just, you know, refocused my life and started working on retiring and getting set up to try to pay off as many bills or try to get as much done as I possibly could get done because I had basically seen the whole world.  I would see forty-five to fifty countries every season.  I was in Europe nine months out the year for twelve years.  So, it was not a whole more you could do.  Most people dream of seeing the world.  That was part of my job.  Most people dream of meeting celebrities.  That was part of my job.  Those were my friends.  So, they weren't celebrities to me.  Those were colleagues and friends and teammates.  Most people dream a lot of things, and a lot of things that most people dream was a part of my life.  And so now I wanted to live the normal life.  I want to eat cookies and chips, too.  And I want to sleep late, and I don't want to work out.  I want to, you know, have fun, like you've been doing for a very long time.  And that's all I was basically focusing on. But closer to 2000, we started taking that training to another level, and I was really in excellent shape.  And three days before the Olympic trials, my knee went out.  And it was because I was still fighting with both Achilles [tendons] and fighting hip flexor now.  And you're changing and alternating your running style, and my knees just couldn't take any more.  It was like I am so tired of running.  I couldn't even move, I couldn't even jog.  We hopped to the car and went straight to the doctor.  They popped and snapped and no medication was working.  It was just, you know, to think that I was doing two thousand sit-ups a day and lifting weights for an hour and a half, and you're training four and five hours every day to capacity, you're eating the right food, you're getting enough water, enough Gatorade and Powerade.  And you're doing all the right things, and it all blows up right before you get to the big dance.  And the cycle repeated itself because all the sponsors said, "Well, you're not going.  You don't need your contract."  Nobody kept me.  They all dropped me, as if I was never ranked in the world, never won a medal.  The cycle had repeated itself.  And I have not watched an Olympic Games yet.  I think I watched the opening ceremonies to 2008 [2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing, China].  Because mentally, it's like it didn't finish like I thought it was going to finish.  And I just couldn't watch the Olympics, you know, looking at the other people winning their medals and stuff. Like, I don't want to watch it.
Story_ID: 290857
Speaker 1: Have you had offers to, you know, coach track or do other--I mean what did you do?  I know you went on to achieve a master's degree.  But, well, tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't get an offer to coach.  I never had an interest to coach, because I know how much work is required of the athlete.  And I think I would probably just be a little too demanding, or too mean for another athlete.  Unless they're world class, they can handle that.  But when you're trying to get there, I don't think I would be able to quite tone it down, because I know the intensity and the real work that goes into it.  But I sponsor a track meet, and I started putting those meets somewhere in 1990, the Rochelle Stevens Invitational Track Meet.  And this year, 2010, made twenty years for my meet.  And it's for two year olds up to masters to compete.  And they come from the Southeast region of the United States to compete and qualify for the AAU [Amateur Athletic Union] or either the U.S.A. track and field age group nationals and championships, or senior games.  So, for the last twenty years I have been giving back to the community, and that's before I even became an Olympian.  I invite college coaches to come in to recruit from this area and offer the young people scholarships.  I also have a sports camp where I actually talk to you about nutrition and how to mentally prepare for a race--how to take care of injuries.  I help you focus, so when you do make it to the big dance, you will be able to cope with what's going to happen versus I didn't have a clue what was going to happen.  And so I teach them television etiquette, and how to answer questions, and teach them to make complete sentences.  And all of this goes on in the camp along with plyometrics--lifting weights, and running and jogging, and things like that.  But my main concern is to be able to educate the athletes on how to conduct yourself.  And that's what's missing in a lot of the sports.  We're never really taught how to conduct yourself in the eyes of the public.  And a lot of the athletes kind of fall into that trap and get bad write-ups, and people not liking them because they wasn't nurtured or wasn't fine-tuned or brushed up as to this is how you answer this question, or this is what you're supposed to do or say.  And so, I teach my athletes in this region proper protocol at an early age.  So with the track camps, the foundation [Rochelle Stevens Foundation], the one thousand dollar scholarship fund given to athletes--I used to send it to the schools, but then I thought some schools might not give them the money.  And then to think, most of them come from below poverty level and you probably don't have the things you need for school.  So, we give you that thousand dollars so you can buy you a trunk, your suitcases, clothes for school, your iron, your microwave, so you can go to college and have the things that you need and help relieve the stress.  Because when you get that full scholarship, yes, that pays for the education.  But it does not get you your twin sheets and your blanket and your winter coat, and the things that you need to take.  And that's what my foundation helps the athletes with.  We want to make sure that you go to school with the things that you need as well.
Story_ID: 290858
Speaker 1: I finished my master's degree from Columbus [State] University [Columbus, Georgia]. And in fact, I was enrolled in '96 [1996] in a dual degree, master's, Ph.D. program.  But like I said, I got caught up in the hype of the Olympics, and kind of put it on the back burner.  So, I got the master's in 2008, and right now I am working on my dissertation in health care reform.  Isn't that easy?  And my Ph.D. studies are in public administration.  So my undergrad is telecommunications and sales, my master's is in public relations, and my Ph.D. would be in public administration.
Speaker 2: And what's your, do you have a (unclear) goal because you have a lot of things going on at once.  So--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You know, as long as you have things to strive for in life, you live longer and you just never get bored.  And my mom [Beatrice Stevens Holloway] would always say when people work a job for twenty-five or thirty years, when they retire, they get bored and they die.  So, I don't want to get bored.  And you know, I keep myself busy, you know, with owning my own business [Rochelle's Health and Wellness Spa, Collierville, Tennessee].  I'll be celebrating eleven years this year with the health and wellness, helping people lose weight and look good as gold.  And that's pretty much the motto here.  But I'm pretty, I'm involved with the community as well.  I serve on several boards, board of directors.  I now live in the suburb of Collierville [Tennessee].  I'm on parks and recreations there, and soon to enter into a program they call Collierville Leadership [Leadership Collierville].  And maybe in the next five or ten years, I'll run for mayor of Collierville, 43,000 and growing.  (Laughter) But I might be Mayor Stevens [HistoryMaker Rochelle Stevens] when I'm in my sixties, I won't have anything else to do.  (Laughter) So, that's kind of what's on the agenda right now.  And it's, you know, just enjoying life, and achieving as much as you possibly can achieve while you have that opportunity.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, we're sitting in the Rochelle Stevens Health and Wellness Spa--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --as we speak.  You founded this in 1999?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And so this has been going on for ten years now, or eleven years.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And you've been honored in the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame [Nashville, Tennessee].  And so, you have a lot of irons in the fire, it seems.
Story_ID: 290859
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there anything that you would do differently if you could go back and change it?
Speaker 2: People ask me that all the time, and I would say no.  I have truly enjoyed every hurdle and obstacle, victory and success that I have had from elementary to junior high, to high school, to college.  I do not regret the choices that I have made because everything that I set forth to do, I was able to achieve it and accomplish it.  And it's nothing that I would, you know, change on it, even from the injury in Atlanta [Georgia].  At least I still got the gold, and that's better than leaving without a medal.  Being able to get my degrees later in life, which I had said when I was in undergrad [at Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], "Oh please, I'm not going to be an old lady sitting in class trying to get a degree."  Well, now I'm the old lady sitting in class turning in homework (laughter), you know, because I don't have anything else to do.  I'm not partying, and I can do my homework.  And so, I enjoy every day.  And when I wake up, I wake up jolly, I wake up with a smile on my face.  And I always say, "This is the day that the Lord has made, and I will rejoice in it."  And that's why if it rains or sleets or snow, every day is a beautiful day to me.  I have always viewed it in, in that capacity.
Story_ID: 290860
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done, again, what would you consider to be your legacy today?
Speaker 2: I hadn't thought of it like that.  You know, when you're a kid, you dream of things.  But I didn't dream the middle age part of my life.  I didn't dream of hall of fame, being a member of the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame [Nashville, Tennessee], Morgan State Hall of Fame, the MEAC Hall of Fame, the Memphis City Schools Hall of Fame, the Intercollegiate Hall of Fame.  I didn't dream of hall of fames.  I didn't dream of having a street named after me.  I didn't dream of having a park named after me.  I didn't dream--those were not dreams.  And so, you just, you know, when you get older and they say, "Where do you see yourself in the next ten years, or you see yourself in the next twenty years?"  Well, at that time, the ten or twenty years were what I saw.  What I didn't see was being an entrepreneur, owning my own business.  I didn't see a Ph.D.  I didn't see some of the other accolades that comes along with it.  I didn't see being able to say, "Hey, I'm [HistoryMaker] Rochelle Stevens, an Olympic gold medalist," and people are like just, "Oh, wow."  You know, it just didn't go that far.  It just only went far enough where I could see.  But the extras, which are those perks that are coming along with it, they make you feel more appreciated.  I definitely didn't see putting on a track meet for twenty years.  (Laughter) You know, all I saw was the clubs had dissipated and the young people here were not being recruited, and they didn't have the opportunity to run in front of college coaches like I had.  And I was like, that's not right.  And so, to be able to know that I have helped thousands of young people achieve dreams and achieve their goals, and to be able to help get them in front of college coaches and to get scholarships--and a lot of them come up to me now, like, "Hey, I ran in your meet [Rochelle Stevens Invitational Track Meet] when I was a kid."  And I'm looking like, "You look older than me now," you know.  And they're twenty-nine and have gotten master's degrees and saying, "I ran in your meet when I was a kid."  It's like wow, I touched that person's life when they were nine or when they were seven or when they were twelve.  And they remembered the day that I talked to them, when they'd lost a race and they was crying, things I don't remember.  It was significant to them, and so I kind of just began to cherish those things.  But I didn't realize the things that I had accomplished as much because I was always striving to be the best.  Until I Google searched myself just two years ago--I refused to do it.  I was like, "There's nothing on here."  And when I pulled it up under my name, it registered over 234 documented pieces--races from college [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], meet records that I had broken, all-time records--things that I didn't even know about my own self.  I'm like, "Oh, okay, I remember that race.  I didn't know it was the fifth all time, you know, best in history.  Wow, I didn't know that."  So I'm learning about myself through Google.  And so I was like afraid to check myself out on Google because I didn't think it was nothing really there.  And so, that's what you call a real legend, when you can actually, when people can actually read about you and know about the good things that you have achieved in life, and how you inspired others to want to dream, and inspired others to want to do better in life.  To me, that's a true legacy, when you're able to touch others where they would want to do better.
Story_ID: 290861
Speaker 1: We met your mother [Beatrice Stevens Holloway] when you came in.  She was relatively young, and she's got, she lost one daughter [Catherine Holloway], but she's got three daughters that have all like gone to college and achieved something.
Speaker 2: And everybody has a master's [degree].  That's a HistoryMaker right there--single parent, four daughters.  And no one has ever been crazy, to the cuckoo house, drugs or alcohol, all of us are college graduates.  You know, that's, we're proud to be able to be a blessing to our mom.  You know, it's a blessing to be able to put her in a new home and pay the note, and to keep her in a new car every two years.  And she shops whenever she likes.  And to be able to take care of her insurance and things, it's an honor to be able to do that for our mom--and she's not sick--or we got to do it.  That was something we committed to do as little girls, and like I said, we've been doing that since '89 [1989].  And you know, I'm sure she's enjoying it.  (Laughter) We be like, "My mother is on children support."
Speaker 1: Now, do you feel any pressure to have children yourself?  You're still young enough to have some.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, I used to crack the joke that I'll have one by forty-five.  But that's next year, and that ain't quite happening.  So now, I'm saying I'll be about fifty.  And by the time I take my child to kindergarten, I'll be the grandmama/mama that was fifty years old and had a baby.  (Laughter) So, I'll be forty-four September the 8th.
Story_ID: 290862
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: My concerns are the young people failing to want to get an education.  I just see it reverting back to they're going to really be poverty stricken.  They're setting themselves up for defeat, early death, jails--the simple fact I work in the Memphis City Schools [Shelby County Schools].  They have no desire to want to study or educate themselves.  And it's just really, it's really bad to see that you can't write, you don't even make complete sentences.  Ebonics has taken over.  Text messaging has taken over.  Everything is written in slang, and that's not, you're not going to make it in the real world with that.  In fact, you're not even going to make it out of high school.  You definitely won't be going to anybody's college if you can't read, write, count, and spell.  And it really hurts my heart to see that the interest of wanting to achieve in life--to get something on your own versus just--you want everything, but you're not willing to work for it.  You're not willing to sacrifice, you're not willing to really dream.  They don't have real dreams.  The role models are not as positive as the role models we had when we were coming up.  We were, my mom [Beatrice Stevens Holloway] talked to us every Saturday, like I said, about going to college, about being successful, about, you know, living right.  There was no such thing as gangs, not in our eyesight.  We didn't know anything about gangs.  These young people are all into gangs and drugs and weapons and cutting school and cussing out your mother.  Your mother is twenty-five and your grandmother is forty.  And, we didn't have those same things going on when we was coming up.  And I just really feel sorry for our youth.  I mean, I really feel sorry for them.  I just don't see a future for them at all if they don't change.
Story_ID: 290863
Speaker 1: Last question is similar to legacy but a little different. Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as outgoing, caring, always trying to motivate others to do the right thing.  I want to be remembered as loving God and helping my family, anything that's dealing with caring.  I can care less about the athletic accomplishments, even though that's what has taken me as far as I have gone.  But I want people to remember me as a person of love and caring, and was just the person that pushed you to do your best.  And that's what I would like for them to remember about me.
