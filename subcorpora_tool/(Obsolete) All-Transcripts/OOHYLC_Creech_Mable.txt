(Laughter)  Mary Ask her if they had to move the building.  Finchum Did they have to move the building?  Mable I moved the building because I wanted to get it off of Bob Donaldson   s  land. When I got the post office, he raised the land rent from ten dollars  a year to a hundred dollars a year. I wanted to get it off of the land, of  his land, so I did. The oil company allowed me to move the post office  onto their camp.  11  Bishop What oilfield was it?  Finchum What oilfield was it?  Mable Huh?  Finchum What was the oilfield name?

Mable Well, we started up another barber shop, and the Carter Oil Company  people were so nice and generous and they wanted us there. They  endorsed us and promoted all this barber shop changes. For a long time,  I wasn   t postmaster. Then, when I got to be postmaster, it was   my  husband had, well, the barber business had dropped a lot, so then he  came to Ponca City and got a job with City Service.
