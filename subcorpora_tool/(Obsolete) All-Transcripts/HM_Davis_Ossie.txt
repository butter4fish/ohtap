Speaker 1: I'm Ossie Davis and I was born December 18, 1917.  I'm eighty-three years old.  My name is spelled O-S-S-I-E D-A-V-I-S, and today's date is March the 9th, I believe, 2001 and we are in New York.
Speaker 2: And your profession also?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  It's difficult to get around to that.  I am an actor and a writer among other things.  I guess those two would cover pretty much my own definition of what I am, an actor and a writer.

Speaker 1: And I ask--I start out by asking five questions of everyone.  They have no relevance.  They're sort of 'People' magazine-ish, but it's--I started it and continue with everyone, and that is I'd like to know what your favorite color is.
Speaker 2: My favorite color would be purple.
Speaker 1: It's purple behind you.  That's pretty good!  Your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food, I suppose, would be chicken.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Springtime.  Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Your favorite place to vacation?
Speaker 2: I don't vacation.  I'm always in a state of relaxation and totally absorbed by what I'm doing to great satisfaction, so I don't have to go any place.  I suppose if I had to choose a place, I've enjoyed Barbados a great deal so if I were forced to choose a favorite place, I suppose I might say Barbados.

Speaker 1: I'd like you to start, you know, talking about your childhood.  You talk a lot about it, you know, in the book ['With Ossie & Ruby: In This Life Together'] and the people, you know, who influenced you, but I'd like you to talk about, you know, your growing up.
Speaker 2: Well, there's a--there's a thousand ways to discuss one's growing up because there are different versions of who you were when you were young, and I've often tried to relocate the little boy in Cogdell, Georgia, and Waycross [Georgia] and what he was like and what he was up to.  I have concluded that the thing about my childhood that defines me best of all would be that I was a daydreamer and a reader, and I liked tremendously to spend time with myself so that I could, in my own imagination, do all the wonderful things that a dreaming boy can do.  And into this imagination, as I grew older, was fed the material from books, the Bible being one of them, and then later motion pictures and radio, but I was a dreamy child.  I didn't have too many imposed restrictions or my chores weren't that hard, and my parents, you know, were not that strict so I had plenty of time to wander around inside my own mind and outside my own community, but a wandering, dreamy boy--I think that would be what I would say I was, and in school, I--it was reading that was the most delicious thing to me because, as I said before, it was from reading that I was able to get the dreams of other peoples and other cultures, and though I was, you know, in Georgia, and it was a segregated society, every year we had what we called Negro History Week so that whatever might have been missing in the schoolbooks that I had was brought forth or supplemented during the time when we were required by our teachers to prepare for Negro History Week so I had a pretty, you know, large idea of who I was and who black people were in our history, going way back.  It--I never had the opportunity, as some people have, to discover one day that there is or there was writers and there were novels and books that I wasn't exposed to.  As far as I was concerned, they were always there, a natural part of my environment.  I was a smart student, bordering on brilliant--very likable, natural material for the 'Teacher's pet' category.  Still, I was manly enough not to be picked on by the other boys who might be jealous that I was the teacher's pet.  I got along very well with students, and I was not athletic at all.  I never really had a passion for games.  I enjoyed watching and, you know, playing with the other kids sometimes--excuse me--sandlot baseball and watching the football team and the basketball team and things like that, but I never, myself, cared too much for sports.  My favorite subject, I suppose, aside from literature, was chemistry, and I think that was because in high school there was a teacher, a man [Lucius Jackson], who taught chemistry who was so fulfilling to me, so responsive, so nice to me that I enjoyed being with him, and he taught chemistry.

Speaker 1: My father [Kince Charles Davis] was a strong heroic man, religious but not hypocritical.  His response to life was highly organized, primarily because he had to feed a family of five children during the time of the Depression, and that could keep a man's nose to the grindstone, but my daddy, though he was a worker, was no ordinary worker.  In the first place, he was a railroad man, and in Waycross [Georgia] and Cogdell [Georgia] during those days, people who worked on the railroad were looked upon with a little more reverence than the average worker, and Daddy was not a Pullman Porter or anything of that kind.  He worked on the section gang that built the railroads and cut the right of way and kept the equipment maintained and the brush cleaned and all of that sort of thing.  And he was in charge of the section gang that did that, and this was something of an anomaly in Waycross, Georgia because there were people in and out of the Ku Klux Klan who thought that my daddy, being a black man, did not deserve having the job of being in charge of the section gang to keep up this little railroad.  This little railroad, by the way, was just twenty-three miles from Cogdell where I was born to Waycross, and it was one of those little tracks specifically laid to achieve an economic purpose, and this purpose was to haul timber from the woods of Cogdell, pine trees in particular, and to bring in supplies and things like that so the railroad was not a railroad in the huge sense.  It had--it didn't have a steam engine at all.  It had an old streetcar which ran off gas or diesel or whatever, and that was the one unit that went from Cogdell to Waycross or Waycross to Cogdell so it wasn't a major operation.  But Daddy helped build the Waycross and Western Railroad line and helped to maintain it, and in order to do that, he had to be in charge of a group of men, black men, fifteen or twenty men, and as I watched him as a child, I became aware of the degree to which he was not only very much like the men but in his own way quite different.  He was a leader.  He was a person whom the men instinctively called 'Chief', and both whites and blacks in this segregated community looked up to him, and it was understood, you know, that if you got into an altercation with him--white or black, you know--one of you might come out dead, you know.  He didn't hesitate.  At the same time, he was a strong Christian, a deacon in the church.  The man didn't go around picking fights, but he wouldn't avoid one if one came his way.  My mama [Laura Cooper Davis] was beautiful and active and a sort of a genius with a sewing needle.  She could make her own dresses and blouses.  They were always so beautiful, and she could take the sacks that we brought groceries in--you know the sacks of beans or flour or meal or whatnot--and once we bought the food, brought it home, and emptied the sacks, Mama would wash the sacks and then would make us pajamas and underwear so we used to go to school with underwear that had all kinds of stuff written on it (laughs), but we didn't mind, you know, 'cause mom made them right--jam up.  No problem whatsoever.

Speaker 1: I, as I said before, was a friendly child in a friendly neighborhood, and we in the community, boys, used to run together both in the--in school and out, and in the summer there was always the swimming hole or we would take a crate and build a wagon, steal some wheels from somewhere and put on the wagon, and one of the fellows had a goat and we would hitch the goat to the wagon and, you know, drive the goat to various places.  There were pecans in the fall, watermelons in the summer.  There was sugar cane, peaches, and apples and a kind of laissez-faire [live and let live] attitude.  We as a group of kids, you know, didn't hesitate to borrow a melon or, you know, pick an apple or whatever if it came within our reach.  We didn't exactly steal it, but we didn't also go and ask the owner whether we could have it or not.  It was fair game, and so we got it.  Early in my childhood I used to be allowed to go to the movies.  In the beginning the movies I saw didn't talk.  They were silent pictures so I was there when we transferred from the silent pictures to sound, and along with the other boys, I enjoyed tremendously the westerns.  We always identified with the white hero riding to rescue the white girl.  If there was somebody black in the film, he would be a clown or a buffoon or a fool, and we would be laughing at him just as loudly as the white folks did.  Of course, our laughter was segregated, too, because in the theater we sat up in the peanut gallery while those in the white community sat down and watched the show.  Some of us could swim.  Some couldn't and on one occasion one of our classmates jumped off into the river and evidently struck his head or something on the dive, and he drowned and then there was death, which was always a mystery and something that we feared.  The town [Waycross, Georgia] had electricity, but the lights in our community would be a street lamp hanging in the middle of the intersection, and then there would not be another light until you got to the next block so it was a kind of dark atmosphere in the night, and whenever death occurred in the community in those days, the bell would toll, the church bell, you know, when somebody died, and some nights us children--you know, our game would be interrupted or our schoolwork would be set aside because we would hear the bell toll, and Mama [Laura Cooper Davis] would call out across the street--we didn't have a telephone at that time--and ultimately find out who had died, and then later in the night there'd be a creaking sound coming into the community, and we knew that that was Arthur Jones, the undertaker, and the hearse.  The hearse in those days had the old wooden spokes and the rims and all, and those spokes creaked as it went along, and he would--Arthur would drive into the community very slow and very stately, and you would hear that creak and then you would want to be close to Mama or Daddy [Kince Charles Davis], sort of be reassured, you know, that Death wasn't gonna get you.  We had the kerosene lamps for illumination and also the fireplace when that was necessary.

Speaker 1: A very important part of my childhood was not only the time I spent in the school but also in the Sunday school.  The church was the center of the cultural life of the community, and the church was a place where religion and faith and the Bible were very much alive, and we knew about God and Jesus and Moses and David and Samson and Paul and Peter.  We were required every Sunday to go to Sunday school and to be responsive, and the church in those days was the place where you really got the moral contours of your character and of your life.  It was the place where the Ten Commandments were taught to you, both in precept and example.  The preacher was a moral figure who had the power to elicit punishment and whom we looked upon not as a mysterious character but as somebody who was--the preachers were sort of set aside on a higher plateau than the rest of us.
Speaker 2: In our school [in Waycross, Georgia] the teacher was the supreme authority.  There was the principal and closer to us was the teacher in the classroom.  My first teacher, whom I don't really remember, is no longer with us when I was in primer, but I got into first grade and there was a teacher who reminded me a lot of my mama [Laura Cooper Davis].  She was young and pretty and warm, very encouraging, and her name was Mary Lee Hall.  She's still alive and lives now in Columbus, Georgia, and our classes were conducted in such a fashion that we all essentially would respond to the teacher's question, and we learned a lot by rote, and we could repeat, you know, the tables and the various things that were required, 'Pledge of Allegiance'.  We could repeat those things, as we gladly did whenever the teacher said it was time to do that.  And when the teacher would assign to us what it was she wanted us to learn for Negro History Week, that was a high time, and the various children were given various assignments.  I remember, I think, one time my job was to recite Paul Laurence Dunbar's 'When Your Mama Says the Blessing and the Corn Pone's Hot' [poem titled, 'When de Co'n Pone's Hot'], and the teachers spent time after school teaching us these--training us.  One child would have to know Frederick Douglass' orations.  Another would have to learn the poems of Phyllis Wheatley, and various other aspects of black history would be emphasized.  And then when the day came, the community would be invited to come to the school, sit in the auditorium while we children would go up on the stage one by one and recite what it was that we had learned with a great deal of pride, and I remember--with a little fear and trepidation, too, because the teachers who had taught you would be standing in the wings, you know--and I remember when I was doing 'The Corn Pone's Hot', I ran a blank, and I looked and I saw my teacher, you know, and I think I came up with two original stanzas before I could get back on track, which didn't--I don't think the audience knew that I'd gone off (laughs).  The teacher knew what that was, but it was a wonderful experience.  It was.
Story_ID: 17428
Speaker 1: Now, Waycross [Georgia] had the advantage of this black enclave--segregated, but black--and we saw ourselves in positions of authority--black preachers, black teachers, black people in the barbershop, black doctor, black dentist--but we were surrounded by a hostile world, part of which was the Ku Klux Klan, and there was always the threat that something dire might happen or something--some animosity might break loose and endanger us in the community.  And a large part of my own culture--and this I wasn't aware of at the time--a large part of my own culture was not tainted but sort of geared to protect me from the areas where I might inadvertently do something or say something that could get me hurt--how to behave in the presence of white people, and for the black boys particularly, how to relate to the white female--and we were sort of taught this and it was sort of a part of who we were and what we had to absorb.  I remember when I was about five or six, coming home from school.  I had maybe a couple of books with me.  We didn't have book bags in those days, and two policemen in a car drove up, stopped.  "Come here, boy."  I turned and went to them.  "Get in."  I got in the car and they drove me down to the police station, and I got out of the car and went in with them.  They were not threatening, and I wasn't frightened by them, and when we got inside, you know, they were about their business, and there were others, and they acted as if I was just a kid hanging around, and finally they told jokes and I laughed at them, and then one of them took syrup and poured it on my head, and another gave me some peanut brittle and put me on the streets and told me, "Go home now.  Don't get into any devilment," and I did.  And although I was five or six, I didn't tell my mama [Laura Cooper Davis] or my daddy [Kince Charles Davis].  I knew that something had been done to me that defined me in a way, but I knew not to tell them because if Daddy were angered or if Mama were threatened, what would I do?  So I swallowed that, but I always knew that that really was meant to tell me that I was a nigger and that I had a place and that I should keep in that place.  As I think back on it, I think it was designed specifically to get my consent to the system of segregation.  In other words, they had to ascertain whether I was going to be a good boy or a bad nigger then, and they ascertained it by my response and me being sensitive and likable and happy.  I'm sure I laughed when they laughed, and I didn't feel threatened by the whole thing at all, but they had somehow 'niggerized' me, and it lasted for many a year, and I suppose some of the effects of that were still beyond me.
Story_ID: 17429
Speaker 1: Well, I got to high school in 1930, and I graduated in 1934.  I went to Center High [School, Waycross, Georgia], and Center High was a school that had originally been organized by the black parents of Waycross [Georgia] because they had no high school.  Eventually Center High was phased into the state system, but it started out because the community wanted it, and I think it was an exceptional school.  It was there from among my teachers I met people whose fingerprints are still on me.  There was a Miss Wilhelmina Gaines who came from Detroit [Michigan] who loved English.  She taught us to love it.  She spoke as if she were tasting the words, and I have been influenced by the picture of her.  She was--she was beautiful.  She had long black hair, gold teeth, and was always so cleanly and sharply dressed and always smiling, but she did love poetry and taught me to love it, too, Miss Gaines, and I already mentioned Lucius Jackson who was the man teacher who taught me chemistry, but these were only two.  There were other teachers who had other qualifications, and I benefited from them all.  I was, in a sense, a perfect student.  I would know the drift of the book or the lesson, and when I got the book, I would immediately read it from beginning to end, and that was even true of arithmetic and algebra and all those things so that I had finished chemistry before my last year in high school, and Jackson, Professor Jackson, let me work as his lab assistant that last high school year, and that was marvelous.  He also was the coach, and when he found out that I had no aptitude for anything whatsoever, he still allowed me to go with the team as a water boy so I traveled to Jacksonville [Georgia] and Valdosta [Georgia] and various other places along with the team to be with Jack [Professor Jackson].  And it was there that I decided I wanted to become a playwright.  I think that there was a classmate of mine.  His name was Robert Harris, and his parents owned a drugstore. They owned the only Cadillac [automobile] in town for black folks, and there weren't many for whites.  They, in essence, were rich, and every summer they would take him to New York and he'd spend his summers in Harlem [New York], and when he came back, he would regale us with his stories of what was going on in the cabarets and talking about Duke Ellington and [Louis] Louie Armstrong and various other places so I got an earful of all of that, and it seems to me that--I don't know whether he encouraged me to write something or he had written something and I decided to copy it--but I started out, I wrote a four-page play, and my teacher, for some reason, encouraged me to put it on.  I put it on with my classmates, and somehow I knew that that's what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.

Speaker 1: Now, my father [Kince Charles Davis], as I said before, was a very independent man.  He had learned about the building of railroads and the maintenance of track and all that stuff while he himself was a member of the chain gang somewhere in North Carolina, I think it was--Blue Mountains of Virginia or wherever.  But in the very middle of the Depression, he gave up his job as this engineer in charge of the section gang and decided to do what it was he wanted to do.  What he wanted to do was to, in essence, become a doctor, but it was too late, but what he did have to offer was the knowledge taught to him by his father [Raiford Chatman Davis] or his grandfather of certain herbal remedies possibly coming all the way from Africa.  So he set out to produce these herbal remedies and would--you know, he would produce them in the wash pot and bottle them, label them.  He had labels made and put them in his old car and go out into the countryside and sell his medicine to the black folk, and some whites, way out in the rural area.  Nobody had any money, but they were always willing--for some tonic or whatever daddy had to offer--to give him a chicken or a pig or a mess of greens or corn, potatoes, stuff like that, so when he came back, he might have not too much in the way of actual money, but his car would be loaded with the goodies that we needed, you know, to eat and--excuse me.  He kept at it until finally he was able to build a regular drugstore and send one of his sons, my brother, to college to study pharmacy so that when he came back, Daddy finally had what he dreamed of--a pharmacy with a pharmacist in it.  He was a wonderful man, a strict man, strong man, and all of his children were very much impressed by him.  We were our father's sons.  Even our sister wanted his attention.  To this day, I regret so much that we as boys had natural access to him whereas she, as a girl floating around, never had that, and she suffered for that.  We didn't know it, you know.  She is no longer alive or with us, but we were all Daddy's boys.  Mama [Laura Cooper Davis] was the traditional supportive wife and mother, and I, as I said before, was a very good student.
Story_ID: 17431
Speaker 1: I was a very good student and finished at the top of the class--in the top five or whatever--and I was given two possible scholarships, one to Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and the other to Georgia State [University] in Savannah [Georgia].  This was in 1934.  My family had moved away from Waycross [Georgia] to a small town in Georgia called Valdosta.  At--I went, after I'd graduated, to the family in Valdosta, and we didn't have enough money for me to go either to Tuskegee or to Savannah, but it so turned out that my mama [Laura Cooper Davis] had two sisters who were living at the time in Washington, D.C., and it was thought that if I could get to Washington, D.C., I could go to school there 'cause I could live with them.  We decided for me to lay out of school for a year, save money, and then go to Washington, D.C.  I stayed out of school a year.  At the end of the year we had ten dollars in cash, and Mama gave me the ten dollars and a little lunch, and she wrote to her sisters and told them I was coming, and I went to the edge of town to the highway and stuck out my thumb and hitchhiked from Valdosta, Georgia all the way ultimately to Washington D.C.  I went--my, my aunts accepted me.  There was this big university, Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  They told me where it was, and I went and told them where I was from and what I wanted to do, and at that time, there was a thing called the National Youth Administration [N.Y.A.] that had been put together--a scholarship fund put together by Mary McLeod Bethune and Eleanor Roosevelt so the people from Howard sent for my transcript from Center High [School, Waycross, Georgia], and when they got it, they said, "You're qualified to receive the N.Y.A. Scholarship," so they gave me the scholarship, and in the fall of 1935 I entered Howard University.  I didn't have an overcoat.  I had very little of the means and the wherewithal to survive, but it didn't seem to bother me.  The people on the campus were extremely friendly, and the--one of the officers--Dr. J. Sinclair Price was his name, who was in charge of welcoming all the students, you know--gave me a job in the library, and on one occasion when it was snowing, he gave me his coat and I went to class.  All the black literature that I could register for, I did.  I studied with Sterling Brown.  I studied with Alain LeRoy Locke that very first year, and I majored in English and I was introduced to English literature going all the way back from 'Beowulf' all through the whole arc of English literature, from [William] Shakespeare, [Percy Bysshe] Shelley, [John] Keats, all these wonderful writers, [Charles] Dickens and whatnot, and I just gouged myself on that kind of literature.  At the same time from Sterling Brown, I--you know, Langston Hughes, Zora [Neale] Hurston, and various other black writers, you know, that he introduced us to so I knew all that.  One of the most interesting things that happened to me on the campus was, in a sense, meeting a group of students, most of whom were West Indians, and they sort of formed a clique, not because they wanted to but because they didn't quite fit in with the regular sort of highfalutin' culture that obtained at Howard at the time, and I was a smart young whippersnapper, and they sort of took me under their wings.  I couldn't afford books so I used to go to the Library of Congress every day, pull out the books, and study my assignment, but among the West Indians was a young man named Eldon Stuart Medas.  Now, I don't know what Medas was majoring in, but he knew Shakespeare and could quote it.  He knew Oscar Wilde and could quote it.  He knew some of the great critics of England.  I forget some of the names--[John] Ruskin, and all--and he could spout these people, and wow!  That fascinated me.  I became his lackey almost, his footman.  I followed him around and he was very appreciative, and he taught me so much, you know, about literature and about life.  He was a bit of a lover, and we didn't go far in that department, but boy, did he tell me what English literature truly was.  As I was learning it from the teacher from the academic side, Eldon would come and almost give you the inside scoop on what really was happening, and that was--it was wonderful!  Absolutely delightful!
Story_ID: 17432
Speaker 1: I studied, as I said before, with Dr. Alain LeRoy Locke who was head of the Department of Philosophy [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  Locke was the first black Rhodes Scholar ever (with emphasis), and he had discovered some people like Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, and whatnot, and was interested in the students and what their ambitions were and where they were going.  I passed one of his examinations, and evidently he was impressed by what he saw on the paper and invited me to his office, sat me down, said, "Young man, what are you going to do with yourself?"  I told him I wanted to be a writer.  He said, "Writer?  Write what?"  "I want to write plays."  He was slightly taken aback.  He said, "Where are you from?"  He'd already heard the big-foot country accent in my voice.  I said, "I'm from Waycross, Georgia."  "I don't mean Waycr--yeah, Waycross, but where?"  I said, "That's the name of the town."  He said, "You want to write, you say?"  "Yes."  "Write plays for the theater?"  I said, "Oh, yes."  "Have you ever been in the theater?"  "Oh, yeah.  Every Saturday night in Waycross we used to go to see the cowboy pictures."  "No, no, no, no.  Live people up on the stage?"  And I said, "Well, I did go to the Howard Theater [Washington, D.C.], and I saw Billie Holiday and Ethel Waters."  He said, "No, that's still not it.  Actors in a play up on stage.  You never saw?"  I said, "No, sir."  "You're gonna write plays and you never even saw one play?"  I said, "Yes, sir."  He said, "Well, I tell you what you do.  When you finish here, you go to New York where the theater is.  Go to Harlem [New York], and there's a little theater group there called the Rose McClendon Players.  You tell them I sent you.  Ask them to let you join.  If they let you join, then join the company, and once you join, you do everything that's possible for you to do--act, sing, dance, build scenery, paint sets, hustle lemonade, push programs--whatever."  And this to me was such wisdom.  I mean, this was what I had really come to college to find out so once he told me that, I had what I came so I didn't bother to stay to graduate.  I decided to go to New York and find this little place.  There was--our plan was--my friend and I who decided to go to New York--was to go on April 16th, 1939.  It turned out that that was the Sunday Marian Anderson was going to sing at the [Abraham] Lincoln Memorial so we delayed our, delayed our departure for a full week so we could hear Marian Anderson,  and standing there listening to that voice and becoming aware of what that voice was doing, reaching inside of me and making me--empowering me, making me bigger and stronger than what I, what I was.  It was, it was almost like a religious conversion listening to Marian Anderson.  But anyway that next Sunday, my friend and I caught the train from Penn [Pennsylvania] Station in Washington [D.C.] and went on up to Harlem.  Now Medas, who as I said was West Indian, had worked out a ploy for my friend and me to survive for awhile.  The ploy was this.  I was to pretend that I was a West Indian and go into the West Indian community with this letter from Eldon, and if I were accepted, they would find me a job and do all those things so I took Eldon's letter, went to Harlem, found the people to whom he had written the letter, went to them. They found me a place to stay and ultimately found me a job in the garment center, and I got to Harlem Sunday, April 23rd, I think it was, and Monday the 24th, I found the Rose McClendon Players.  It was situated at the 124th Street [public] library in the basement.  I walked in the door, entered the theater, and I suppose that was the end of my search.  I had found the place that was gonna be my home, my career, and everything--Rose McClendon Players.
Story_ID: 17433
Speaker 1: I want to ask one question though about the Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] experience, and that is you learned a lot or you talk a lot about learning from West Indian culture and how that fascinated you.  It was almost--there were two cultures, it was the British culture that fascinated you, you know, and the literature out of that, where you say you preferred--and then the West Indian culture that you, you know, gained appreciation for.  And it was a lot different from what you had sort of come from, and I'm just wondering if you could comment on that a little bit more.
Speaker 2: Well, the whole thing was strung together by what was going on in the world at that time.  Before I left home in `35 [1935], [Italian dictator, Benito] Mussolini had invaded Ethiopia, and we in the black community were incensed about the fate of Haile Selassie, and we saw the war coming and were concerned about what would happen to black people, to African people, and to West Indian people so the campus was a hotbed of discussion and argument back and forth on these questions.  So my coming from Waycross [Georgia] and Valdosta [Georgia], which was extremely parochial, and the only window to the world I had when I was down there was the weekly copy of the 'Pittsburgh Courier' [African American newspaper], you know, so I was steeped in all the elements of black life but knew very little about West Indian and African culture, but my--so my interest was piqued because in the dormitory and the bull sessions and all, there would be somebody from Africa or from the West Indian communities in heated argument about what was to be done about colonialism, what was to be done about an anti-lynching law, all of these things.  So it was the West Indians who gave me a sort of international perspective on how our struggle fit in with what was happening in the rest of the world, and I remember one of the students, you know, coming into a bull session with a book and said, "This is 'The Communist Manifesto'."  I said, "What is that?"  "Well that--this is a book about Communism.  This is gonna solve all the problems.  We're gonna get rid of colonialism, gonna get rid of Jim Crow [institutionalized racial segregation] and all, and this is the way we're gonna do it."  So I became interested in reading the 'Manifesto'.  I became acquainted with [Karl] Marx and all on the campus at Howard, so when I left Howard, I was much more involved in the struggle of our people than when I came on the campus, and the--so that when I went to New York the awareness in the struggle intensified because Harlem [New York] was sort of the headquarters of everything black at that time so it was easy to find the Garveyites [followers of Marcus Garvey's Black Nationalist movement], easy to find the Communists, easy to find the people who stood on that ladder on 125th Street and spoke about subjects that I'd never heard about before so that was, that was the difference between coming to Howard and coming to Harlem.

Speaker 1: Well, at the end of World War II in 1945, I was in the depth of the deepest depression I had ever known because earlier that year in `45 [1945], [U.S. President] Franklin Delano Roosevelt had died and then on August the 7th we had dropped the atomic bomb, bomb over Hiroshima [Japan], and somehow the whole civilization seemed to come to an end.  Also, even then, black soldiers when we got back were being treated almost worst than we had been treated when we, when we were going away.  First night I got back to a camp from Africa and went to a camp in Missouri--you know, we were called about two o'clock in the morning, lined up in the company streets.  The sheriff comes along with a white girl, and she looks to see which one of us has raped her, and I said, "Oh, my God, here we are in this thing again."  And the treatment of black soldiers at that time even before the war was over, you know, began to tell us something, and when the war was over, it intensified so I felt whoever won the war, black folks had lost it, you know, and I was depressed and distressed, got out of the army, went back home to Valdosta [Georgia], and before I was there a week, I got a wire from [Richard] Dick Campbell, who was head of the Rose McClendon Players, saying that they're having--they're gonna produce a play about a black soldier.  "Why don't you come on back up and try out for it," which was exactly what I needed, and so I came back to New York, went to live with Dick and his family, tried out for the play, and was accepted in the lead role.  The play was called 'Jeb' (1946).  In the rehearsals, I became aware that among the understudies out in the rehearsal hall was a young girl with big beautiful eyes and plaited hair down her back.  She had come in to understudy the lead, and I became aware of her and--but, you know, not in any particular way--but when the leading lady turned out to be unable to fulfill what the director was looking for, they decided to let her go and look for somebody else.  Now, in a case like that, you bring on the understudy to keep the rehearsals rolling until you replace the actor.  Well, they had let the young lady go, and Ruby Dee stepped on stage as the understudy, but the minute Ruby Dee stepped on stage, we all knew, look no further.
Story_ID: 17435
Speaker 1: Ruby [Dee] took over [the lead role in the play 'Jeb'] and you knew that, you know, everyone knew that that was it.  There wasn't gonna be a search for someone else.
Speaker 2: As I said, the minute Ruby stepped on the stage, everybody knew that this was the answer to our problems, and what impressed me most about her was her absolute professionalism.  Not only did she know the play, she knew the lines and she knew the movements.  It was almost as if she had been rehearsing all the time so we didn't really miss a beat.  We picked right up and went on through, and her address to the part, the way she conducted herself, you know, impressed everybody.  This lady seemed to know more about theater than the rest of us put together.  The play didn't last very long, but before it was over, Ruby and I were hired to join the national tour of another play, 'Anna Lucasta', and the national tour took us from Connecticut in September of '46 [1946] all the way across the country to Seattle [Washington] in 1947, playing a week here, three nights here, two or three weeks there.  We had a Pullman [train car]--the [theatrical] company--and that Pullman we'd put on our train and take him from Cleveland [Ohio] to Cincinnati [Ohio] and then Cincinnati to Toledo [Ohio] and then to Detroit [Michigan] and then on to Saint Louis [Missouri] and Albuquerque [New Mexico] and all across the mountain so we got to know each other very well, and so finally, after the play was over and we were back in New York, we were working together in something else, and then we got cast in another play on Broadway, and we decided one day that when we had off, we'd go to [New] Jersey and get married, and that was in 1948, and we've been married ever since.
Story_ID: 17436
Speaker 1: Can you talk about sort of the early years of your marriage?  Let's do that then.
Speaker 2: The early years of our marriage--I was living in the Bronx [New York] when we got married.  Ruby [Dee] was living with her mother in Harlem [New York] so she moved from Harlem to our little place in the Bronx.  We were both working in the theater.  I forget--I was doing something, a different play, 'Stevedore', and Ruby was doing another thing.  We decided to move from the Bronx to Mount Vernon [New York].  This was in 1950, and our first child [Nora Davis Day] was a couple of weeks old when we got to Mount Vernon in 1950.  Well, the 1950s were interesting in more ways than one.  We'd been heavily influenced by Paul Robeson, Langston Hughes, Lena Horne, and others in our theatrical activities, and these people were now began--well, it was--they became the targets of the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] and the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency], and all other kinds of things because of their commitment--Paul's commitment to trying, you know, to express his friendship to the Russian people and also because he felt that the--America and England and the capitalist system were gonna go back on the promises that they had made to get rid of colonialism so Paul became a target.  Those of us who knew and admired and loved him, you know, we rallied around him so we became targets, too, and many of us lost jobs and other opportunities in trying to demonstrate our care and concern for him and the positions that he took.  Paul's passport was denied him in 1950, and it was only in 1958 that he got it back.  In those eight years there was a tremendous struggle in the black community, in the theatrical community.  The McCarthyites [people vehemently opposed to Communism] came and devastated us, you know, in all sorts of ways, but '58 [1958] did come.  Paul was granted his passport and went off to Europe for awhile.  Ruby and I continued in our work.  We--in 1959 Ruby came in 'Raisin in the Sun', which was produced by Philip Rose.  When that was over, I had a play of my own called 'Purlie Victorious', which I took to Phil Rose, and in September of 1961, 'Purlie Victorious' was done on Broadway [New York].  Ruby and I both worked in it, and we were in it until it closed, May of the next year.  I then went to Rome [Italy] to do a film, and Ruby was invited to come to Europe from [Anthony] Tony Richardson to do a film, but we didn't know exactly how to handle the family situation, what to do with the children.  There were some backers who wanted us to take a national tour of 'Purlie Victorious' on the road, and once again we said, "Shall we take the children with us?"  "No."  "Shall we leave them by themselves?"  "No."  "What shall we do?"  So we decided to stay with the children and not take 'Purlie' out at all, but I continued to work and she continued to work, and my play 'Purlie Victorious' was, in a sense, my response to the time when they had poured the syrup on my head.  I set out to write a very angry, vituperative play expressing all that had pent up in me, but I found that as I wrote it and read it back, it was so--the language was so exaggerated, and the characters--the white folks were so mean and the black folks were so holy that I read the stuff, and I started eventually to laugh at what I'd been writing, and eventually it ceased to be a play about a young angry boy and became a play about a preposterous preacher called 'Purlie Victorious', and we did it for comedy and for laughs.  Ruby, you know, has done not only 'Raisin in the Sun' on stage but in motion pictures.  She's done things which she'll certainly tell you about, but one of the things I'm proudest of is that she finally put together some of her written works into a thing called 'My One Good Nerve' [one-woman show debuted in 1999], which I produced, and we did it in Los Angeles [California] and New York and Saint Louis [Missouri] and various other places, and I'm anxious to get back on the road with that.  I have some other plays that I want to finish.  I'm anxious to get on with that, and Ruby has some other things that she's anxious to do so we have a plate full that will keep us busy for the rest of our life and beyond.

Speaker 1: I was surprised in the book ['With Ossie and Ruby: In This Life Together'] when you were talking about yourself as a writer and almost in a self-deprecating, you know, manner except you did--but you--it was like a constant theme really, and I was wondering if you--you know, you had mentioned that when you were young, you didn't exercise discipline.  You know, you would talk about writing and then writing, and I was just wondering if that was really sort of a self-analysis of yourself or, you know, did you--do you really sort of feel that way because in your--a lot of the book had a tone of extreme modesty to it, for someone who has been, you know, from an outsiders view.  You know, I've admired you and your wife for years as the most (unclear) in the world, you know.  And I was wondering, does this go back to religious training?  Does it go back to, you know, the 'nigger euphemism'?  What does it go back to?
Speaker 2: Well, let us say that I have much to be modest about.  I want to be a writer, but I want to be a specific kind of writer, and it was really not--it wasn't really a question of discipline but a question of ignorance, and let me explain that.  When I wrote 'Purlie Victorious', my subject was drawn from my past experiences.  Those things were true.  They were there.  They were part of history.  We all knew them.  All I had to do was to pick from what I knew and put it on stage.  I wanted now to write a play that looked to the future.  The question that was thrown to us by the civil rights revolution was, "What do we mean by integration, you know, freedom from what but also freedom for what?"  "How much of America do we want?"  "How much of America are we willing to be accepted into?"  "Are we willing to give up everything black just to be American or where do we stop?"  And "What is the nature of the power that we need, not only to be free, but to be equal?"  Now these are questions that I--I could read about them, but they required research, they required thinking, and they required the acquisition of the skill to write a play that was not a lecture, a play that was not a course in economics or political economy or political philosophy but a play about human beings that had passion, that had all the attributes of a man-woman relationship, but the background would have to be these, these tremendous pulls that are being exerted even as we speak on the black community.  Now the plays of today and the knowledge of today are realism, and they deal with us, in a sense, as we are.  I wanted to deal with us as we are but also as we should be.  You know, right now we are at the mercy of economic and social forces over which we don't have control as black people so I wanted my plays to reach out and begin to deal with those problems, but in order to do that, I had to take the time to learn what it was that I was talking about and then learn how to express that in dramatic terms.  So the play that I started to write, say, thirty years ago, I'm still working on, but that's because so many things have changed in the black-white equation in this country in those thirty years, how to do a play that does justice to them all, you know, and you won't get it by thinking about life as a child or your mom and dad's life or even what it is to be--to work in an office or an executive suite now as we do.  What are the deepest possible pulls being exerted on the people of the world?  How do you identify those?  How do you make them into stories?  Let me give you one problem, and then I'll quit, but I think it'll be sufficient to you.  In the 1960s the Africans finally broke away from colonialism, threw it aside, and they took down the colonial flags of Belgium and France and Britain, and they ran their own flags.  "Free at last!  Free at last!  Thank God Almighty, we're free at last!"  But now look at what has happened in Africa and the third world now--free from colonialism in terms of the flag but head over heals in debt.  How are those people going to realize their freedom with all this debt hanging over them, and how do we deal with those problems in terms of plays and cultures and operas and dances?  That is what interests me.  That's what throws me.  I would rather write a play trying to face those issues and fail, than to write one about common everyday occurrences and succeed, not because those plays shouldn't be written, but there are people out there who know how to do that better than I do.  I don't want to be just another one.  I want to look deep in the rock and see as much as I can see and then say as much as I can say.  A country like South Africa--what a magnificent story.  Coming from apartheid through the release of Nelson Mandela and finally the people are free, and they have an election.  "Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we're free at last!"  And that's true.  The people of South Africa are free, but the people of South Africa are not equal so we're just gonna keep circling around it--well, we're free at last--or are we gonna sit down and say, "How do we achieve this next step?"  And I want to write things that relate directly to this challenge, not to come up with answers but to put these concerns on the plate for our consideration.
Story_ID: 17438
Speaker 1: Now do you think you'll do that Mr. Davis?
Speaker 2: I'm sure I will.  You know, the thirty years I spent have paid off.  I've got four plays now, but I need to get to the table and start, you know, bringing them up to snuff.
Speaker 1: Now you talked about being a small--wanting from youth to be in theater, you know, or to do creative--that creative has always been--you've always had a creative mind, and you always wanted to do something creative, and I wanted you just to talk about why, you know, the creative is so important to, you know, let's say society in many ways.
Speaker 2: Well, creativity, the arts, have to do with matters of the spirit, and without matters of the spirit, our chances to become human beings are nil.  We won't make it.  We're halfway now from being animals on our way ultimately to becoming human beings, but it's not guaranteed that we will make it.  If we allow ourselves to be swamped by our technology, by our capacity to use science to uproot societies and change things around, you know, then we'll lose the way.  We need art to tell us why life is important and also to confer that importance on life.  Art tells us what's worth dying for, not science, and that's why art and things of the spirit and creativity are absolutely important.
Story_ID: 17439
Speaker 1: You know, you had talked about things that you still want to do, what things you still have inside of you.  What, what would you--what haven't you done, you know, in your career that you would like to do?
Speaker 2: The very thing for which I was born--to write plays.  I've written one that I'm proud of and a few others, but that was by way of preparation.  The time has come now to either do it or get off the stage.  I think I'm ready.
Speaker 1: And what do you want your legacy to be, Mr. Davis?  What do you want that legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I have no thought too much about encumbering future generations with some legacy from mine.  I would like it to be known that I was a part of those who were lovers of mankind, that I was a creative spirit, and that I knew beauty and I knew love, and that I enjoyed being alive on this earth.  I want to be a part of that, but as far as legacies and things like that, I'm not sure that I want to.  It is very dangerous to trap definition in a box, as if that's gonna last forever.  We live--change is of the essence, and change produced me, and change will ultimately take me from here.  I don't want the whole of history to stop at my grave and stay there forever.  I just want it to be a place where history passed by.  If there's something I do that people think worthy of being made into a legacy and can find some interesting way that doesn't take more than ten minutes, fine.  If not, I'm perfectly willing to be forgotten.  Let somebody else occupy the stage for a while.
Speaker 1: You know, Mr. Davis, I'm not gonna let you end that right there because I understand what you're saying, but at the same time, you're a person who's had such a full life and has influenced so many people so to say that, you know, it's okay that if you're forgotten.  I mean that's--.
Speaker 2: But that's how I happen to have affected so many people because I didn't come into the situation bringing something that Ossie has--"Thus speaks Ossie"  I come into the situation, I'm open and so are you, and what happens--we deal with it as it arises, and when that thing is over, we give it a gentle burial and we go on.  This is wisdom, you know.  We have--we've dedicated too much time and energy to things that are ego-driven, and that would be nice if history were gonna stop, but it ain't.  All of our technological brilliances will one day be looked upon--and our artistic brilliances will one day be looked upon by our children, who will smile at our lack of sophistication and keep on going.  I'm willing to be swept up in the current of existence.  It's treated me well.  I've loved it, and it certainly has loved me, but some legacy?  Umm-mm.  That makes too much claim on the people who come behind me.  Remember, they need a chance to come out and see the sun with their own eyes, and I'm willing to give them that, not what Ossie said.  You know, if I've cleared the way for them to stand, fine.  If they can stand on my shoulders, fine.  But don't waste time turning back to say, "Ossie."  You know, spread your wings.  Fly.  I'll go with you.  That's enough for me, you know?  I'm not kidding.
Story_ID: 17440
Speaker 1: And then what are your hopes, then, for black people then as--you know, when you talk about.
Speaker 2: My hopes for black people is what I hope for all people.  I hope that we can ultimately become educated in time to save us from that which is destructive in our own nature.  I hope we can come up with a culture where our children don't walk into the classroom and shoot each other to death.  I mean, is this what we want to be measured by?  No.  I hope that eventually, both through biological development and through thought and through struggle, we arrive at a vision of ourselves.  Dr. [William Edward Burghardt] Dubois had a marvelous saying that means a great deal to me.  He speaks of life lit by some large vision of goodness, beauty, and truth, and I would like black folks to participate in that life, in that beauty, in that truth, in that goodness, the dance of existence.  I would like us to be in it.  The songs that need to be sung, I'd like us to sing.  The paintings, I'd like us to help paint them, you know, but I don't even know what life is yet.  We are, as a species, much too young to make the final definition.  I hope it's a positive one, and I hope that in the end we, too, will be included in some final statement that "Ah!  This was life, and life was good," but we're a long way from that.
