Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your mother.  Starting with her name, where she was born and where she grew up?
Speaker 2: Bethel Lee Stanton.  Her maiden name was Blackburn.  She was born in Tarrant County, Texas in 1906.  She was a short-order cook in local cafes in the neighboring communities.
Speaker 1: And did she ever share any stories with you about what life was like for her growing up?
Speaker 2: My mother was the second of eleven children.  She was born and reared in the rural part of Tarrant County, and consequently did a lot of outdoor work such as chopping cotton, picking cotton, and also tending to cattle and hogs and other kind of farm livestock.
Speaker 1: And did she ever talk about, you know, the things that she enjoyed doing when she was a child and oh, how she spent her days that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She enjoyed going to church, she enjoyed her siblings, very close knit family, and they helped each other in difficult times.  And she talked about the importance of a family being strong and caring for each other.
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: An angel (laughter).  That's perhaps the best way I could phrase it, just a giant of a lady and a very warm, a very caring, yeah, right.
Story_ID: 203362
Speaker 1: And your father, would you please tell us his name and where he was born and where he grew up?
Speaker 2: Yes, Alvin Herbert Stanton.  He was born in Dallas County, Texas.  He and I mo--he and my mother [Bethel Lee Blackburn Stanton] met apparently at an early age. They married, both at the age of sixteen.  He too grew up in rural part of Dallas County and did a lot of farm work.  And they could have met in the fields, so to speak, either chopping cotton or picking cotton, I don't know the circumstances which, which they met as, as young people.  But he was a very strong person, limited formal education but worldly wise as it were and was his own business man, so to speak.
Speaker 1: And what did your father do for a living?
Speaker 2: He was a contractor hay baler, not a hay baler, but he contracted for baling hay for local farmers and ranchers and again just did a lot of farm work.  He also raised some cotton and other crops as his schedule would permit.
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your father?
Speaker 2: A very strong individual and he was very supportive of his family, very hard worker, was not heavily involved in civic or church affairs, but again he was a very strong family provider.
Story_ID: 203363
Speaker 1: And, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Robert] Stanton, what do you know about your origin or do you know if your family came from free people or slaves?  What do you know about your ancestry?
Speaker 2: Yes, they came from slaves, those who were enslaved--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --there in Tarrant County [Texas] and in Dallas County [Texas].  The community in which I was raised is known as Mosier Valley [Texas] located in far northeast of Tarrant County.  It was incorporated into the Fort Worth [Texas] city limits oh, around in 1965, or '68 [1968] or there about.  But Mosier Valley is one of the oldest, if not the oldest community in Texas founded by African Americans shortly after the Civil War.  And the original landowners are--were relatives of mine in terms of my mother's father [Anderson Blackburn] and, and their father's father grew up on the plantation and subsequently their childrens were raised in the same area.
Speaker 1: And let's talk a little bit about your grandparents, starting with your maternal grandparents, did you know them?
Speaker 2: I only knew my grandmother, and the lady who raised my father but is really--was my mother's mother whom I knew more, and she only lived a very short distance from where my parents lived.
Speaker 1: And what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Delilah Blackburn, and just a lovely lady, very, very much a devout churchgoer, Christian.  She also had a, a small plot of land in which she had a garden and an orchard that was frequent by her grandkids quite often, and to her, to the lack of her knowledge about our sneaking in to get the peaches and the pears, but she was forgiving (laughter).
Speaker 1: And what about your paternal grandparents [Roberta Stanton and Herbert Stanton], did you know them at all?
Speaker 2: I did not know them at all.
Story_ID: 203364
Speaker 1: Tell us, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Robert] Stanton, what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: I can remember the community in terms of unpaved streets, unlighted streets.  I can recall tending to livestock.  I can recall cutting wood because that was the source of the heat of our houses.  I can recall spending a great deal of time with my nieces and nephews and certainly with my uncles and aunts.  So from a childhood perspective, it was an enjoyable life.  Did a lot of outside activities such as swimming, hunting, fishing.  I preferred fishing over hunting, did limited hunting but fishing was perhaps my favorite out, outside sport.
Speaker 1: And what other memories can you share with us?  Like what were holidays like in your house, Thanksgiving and Christmas, what were they like?
Speaker 2: Very cheerful.  The number of gifts were--that were available on Christmas there were sparse but they were given in the full spirit of the season.  Thanksgiving would always be a family gathering, a couple of turkeys and a couple of chickens on the table.  So it was festive times.  But if you were to contrast it with experiences of--that I've had in recent years we were a family of low economic means but nevertheless very high in spirit and family togetherness which made it very rich for all of us.
Speaker 1: And could you please give us the names of your siblings and their birth order, including yourself?
Speaker 2: Yes.  The oldest was Ora Lee Shelton, followed by Franklin Taylor Stanton, followed by Alvin Joyce Stanton, and yours truly as the youngest of the four, Robert George Stanton.
Story_ID: 203365
Speaker 1: Can you kind of describe your community [Mosier Valley, Texas] for us a little bit?  What was the community like then and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes, as I mentioned earlier, it was one, if not the, oldest communities founded by African Americans after the Civil War.  Very close knit community.  At the time I was growing up there were three small churches in the community, a couple of small grocery stores, one or two cafes, if you know what the cafes are, where you can buy some food and beverages and the place where the kids would hang out on Friday and Saturday evenings with the traditional juke box, and they had one school that provided educational opportunities for first through eighth grade.  It was a frame--a wood frame school, two rooms.  I think at the height the enrollment must have been no more than fifty or sixty students.  Had two teachers, so each teacher had four classes.  But the teachers were dedicated, and some of the best training I received were during my earlier childhood.  And, of course, I grew up in Texas when segregation was still the law of the land, so all my childhood in Texas was in a segregated set of circumstances.
Story_ID: 203366
Speaker 1: Now, there was a time, I think you were telling me, it was you who was telling me this where some of the parents in Mosier Valley [Texas] tried to integrate the schools or tried to get the school officials to build a better school?
Speaker 2: That is correct.  For a number of years the [Mosier Valley] School [Euless, Texas] continued to deteriorate, and would and the practice was that the students would receive so-called hand-me-down books from the white schools, desks, and, and other kinds of school supplies and equipment.  But also the school fell in disrepair in terms of broken windows and other things that needed to be repaired as a part of the community maintenance program, of their ongoing maintenance program.  The all-white school board opt not to make those improvements but chose to bus, if you will, the students from first to the eighth grade into Fort Worth [Texas], which means that a six year old in the first grade would have to travel thirty miles each day to attend school under certain circumstances just in order to preserve segregation.  So the community came together and they petitioned the school board that one or two things is to integrate the local schools, which was only less than a ten minute drive from, from Mosier Valley or, or, to substantially upgrade the school.  And the all-white school board balked, and the community had the courage to pursue it in the court of law and they were able acquire the assistance of two attorneys assigned by the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], I shall never forget their names: Attorney [Ulysses Simpson] Tate and Attorney [Crawford Bernard] Bunkley [Jr.].  And they argued successfully before a federal judge which resulted in the school board building a new brick school to serve the students up in Mosier Valley.  But again the school was only from the first to the eighth grade and those from the ninth through the twelfth grade were in fact bused into Fort Worth for, for the junior high and senior high school years, which had been the practice for a number of years.
Speaker 1: Do you remember when they built that new school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It would have been 1954, or '56 [1956] because I enjoyed the brick school in my, I think sixth, seventh, and eighth grade, and then I was bused into Fort Worth for my ninth through my twelfth grade.
Story_ID: 203367
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Robert] Stanton, tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights, oh, I would have just imagine the large oak trees and the dusty roads and the people working in the yards or in the fields and in the community.  The smell--and again, as I said, I did a lot of farm work--and freshly tilled soil, I could always remember that smell although I know that it would ensue some hard work in planting and maybe cutting the hay or picking cotton but it was, it was a, it was a good smell.  And the other was?
Speaker 1: Sounds.
Speaker 2: The sound.  Oh, I don't know, birds chirping and crickets chirping and other kinds of sounds that you would hear in rural America.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I felt at home in that environment.
Story_ID: 203368
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your elementary school years.  What, what was the name of your elementary school?
Speaker 2: Mosier Valley Elementary School [sic. Mosier Valley School, Euless, Texas].
Speaker 1: And who were some of your teachers there?
Speaker 2: Vada Mae Johnson, the-- Miss Johnson as we would call her.  Mr. Barry, Warren Barry [ph.], he was the, the senior teacher and consequently he was the principal but the principal of himself and one, one teacher.  But they were, they were, they were dedicated and they gave their very best to provide quality instruction for the students in the first through the eighth grade.
Speaker 1: And do you remember some of your friends during elementary school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  There was a lot of friends and many of them were related because again it was a close community but certainly my, my nephews and my nieces, my first cousins, second cousins, distant cousin, (laughter) all, all of us were very close in the, in the community, yeah, Jackie [ph.] and Billy Ray [ph.] and C. J. [ph.]  And Reese [ph.], my nephews, Eugene [ph.], Jimmy [ph.], Kenny [ph.], my niece, Helen [ph.], yeah--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --cousins, I know Helen [ph.] and Betty Jean [ph.], (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Now did you have a lot of nieces and nephews who were about your same age?
Speaker 2: Yes, my oldest sister's [Ora Shelton] two oldest sons and I pretty much grew up like brothers.  My oldest nephew and I were roughly a year and a half apart and consequently we grew up much like brothers, Eugene.  He joined the [U.S.] Marines shortly after finishing high school at I.M. Terrell [High School, Fort Worth, Texas], and served in the Marines with distinction for twenty-four years including, I think, two stints of duty in Vietnam, and unfortunately we lost Eugene a year ago, yeah.  And he's survived by a wife and three children.
Speaker 1: Bless you.
Speaker 2: Excuse me, thank you.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Excuse me.  So going back to the elementary school years, what type of student were you?
Speaker 1: I was a very good student, I think so (laughter).  I enjoyed school, I really did.  I do recall though, that I lived a very short distance from school, and I did not want to go to school for my first year but after I went to school I enjoyed it.  And I think my attendance record was almost perfect, yeah.  I must share with you though that there were days that I could only spend a half day in school and other days, other half of the day I would be working with my father [Alvin Stanton] in the hay field driving a tractor or doing whatever was  required--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And do you remember your first day of school?
Speaker 1: I think I do I--because I knew I dreaded going but after I got there and having fun I enjoyed it.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And tell me at this time in your life during the elementary school years, what type of child were you?  Were you mischievous, obedient, what type of child were you?  Quiet?
Speaker 1: I think I was obedient.  I wasn't spoiled I don't believe, (unclear) as that's relative I suppose, depending on who you talk to.  But I didn't ever want to 'cause any concerns or any heartache, particularly to my mother [Bethel Lee Blackburn Stanton] and, and father but particularly to my mother.  And I don't ever recall, and I say this with a lot of humility, I don't ever recall getting a spanking.  I did, I did other than in the third or fourth grade my teacher, Miss Vada Mae Johnson did spank me in the hand with a ruler because I was acting up for some reason or the other but fine.  I, yeah.
Speaker 2: And during this time, during the elementary school years did you have dreams and aspirations?  What did you wanna be when you grew up?
Speaker 1: I'm not quite sure, other than just wanting to grow up and, and, be, be successful I suppose in terms of being a good citizen and being a provider.  You know, there's a lot of talk about having role models or having some individuals or individual in your life to sort of pattern your life after, and all the people in our community were very strong.  They were not what you would call professionals other than Mrs. Johnson, Mr. Barry, and the others who were teachers so consequently I did not interact with a lot of college graduates--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --from, from, from the community, and but all the members of the community stressed the importance of education and they wanted the best for the, for their offsprings there in Mosier Valley [Texas].
Story_ID: 203369
Speaker 1: And did you and your family attend church?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, yes.
Speaker 1: What were those experiences like?
Speaker 2: St. John Missionary Baptist Church [Euless, Texas].  I was very active in church as a youngster in Sunday school as well as the regular worship service and took an active role, which admittedly has been diminishing over the years (laughter).
Speaker 1: And tell me, let's talk a little bit about the junior high school years.  I know that you didn't go to a different school but around this time like sixth, seventh, and eighth grade, what kind of student were you and what kind of young man were you starting to become?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I wasn't necessarily a  loner I, because my siblings were out of the household so to speak as I was growing up but I interact a lot with my cousins and my nieces and nephews, but I had no difficulty in doing things alone, so to speak.  I felt that I was a good student, and I took an active role in community and, and school affairs.  And I looked forward to graduating from Mosier Valley [School, Euless, Texas] and going into, to Fort Worth [Texas] public schools.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  Which was quite an experience.
Speaker 1: And were you starting to have some different dreams and aspirations at this time in your life about, were you think about what you wanted to be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: Quite candidly I don't believe so.  I had not looked that far ahead, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And your brother [Franklin Stanton] had gone off to war when you were--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --how old?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Frank, I called him Big Bubba, he was drafted into World War II [WWII] and then he was discharged and there was a lapse of a few years and then he volunteered for the Korean conflict [Korean War] and he must have entered Korea in '50 [1950] 'cause he was killed in 1951, I think at the age of twenty-five.  I was eleven years of age, and I remember that day in which my father [Alvin Stanton] and mother [Bethel Lee Blackburn Stanton] received the notice from the Army department [U.S. Department of the Army].  It's something that has really bothered me ever since in that, in fact, I still may look into it. It is customary for the [U.S.] Army or the, any armed force services to try to make personal contact with the family, and in this instance I don't believe there was that effort. So my father and I was coming from the fields one late evening and stopped by the mailbox and got the mail and when he and my mother opened it up, there was the notice that my brother had been killed, and then my father and I drove over to my oldest sister [Ora Shelton] and she and my oldest, my brother were very, very close, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And do you remember like a discussion, you know, among your parents and that kind of thing they, did your father know what it was before he opened it?
Speaker 2: No, no, it was a just letter with the outside, logos, our, our name, you know, U.S. Army and U.S. Department of Army--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --right but had no idea what the, what the message or the contents of the letter might be.
Speaker 1: What impact did your brother's death have on the family?
Speaker 2: It was traumatic.  And I believe that he was the only member of our family who had been lost in active duty.  I've had a number of uncles to have served in World War II, and my mother's uncle and I don't know whether Uncle Sun [ph.] served in the [U.S.] military or not but, but he was only one that was lost so that was a, devastating  experience.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 203370
Speaker 1: --And tell me a little bit about who was influencing you as a young person?  Who are you being influenced by?
Speaker 2: I think, you know, candidly it would have been my mother [Bethel Lee Blackburn Stanton], yeah, yeah, just her warmth, her stature, her caring being--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --yeah.  But my teachers too.  I mentioned Miss [Vada Mae] Johnson, Mr. [Warren] Barry [ph.], also a Mr. Reddick [ph.] who succeeded Mr. Barry as the principal [of Mosier Valley School, Euless, Texas], all of them were, you know, dedicated to the young people and I think that was the influence I suppose.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I didn't think of it at that time of being influenced to try to succeed or whatever the case may be but undoubtedly they had some influence on me.  Also my pastor, I felt very close to Reverend [F.D.] Hemphill was the pastor of the St. John Missionary Baptist Church [Euless, Texas] as I was growing up.  And yeah, he had a lot of influence on me too, just in terms of, just his presence, yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And where did you attend high school?
Speaker 2: I was bused along with the other eighth, ninth, from ninth, tenth, and eleventh, twelfth graders from Mosier Valley [Texas] initially to a George Washington Carver [Elementary/]Junior High School [Fort Worth, Texas], which after probably six, eight years after I finished my ninth grade, George Washington Carver eventually merged with I.M. Terrell High School [Fort Worth, Texas].  And so I was bused again along with all the other students thirty miles each day for four years in order to preserve segregation.  Yeah, so we rode the traditional yellow bus.  And there were a number of other communities within oh, that thirty to fifty radius of Fort Worth [Texas] that would also have to experience the same thing from other communities.  Some of these names would sound strange to you, Grapevine [Texas] was a small community, Arlington [Texas], Bedford [Texas], yeah, all would be bused in to, to I.M. Terrell High School.
Speaker 1: Did you kind of resent that that you had to go so far out when there were schools in your neighborhood?  Or in your, in your black community (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: When, when, when the whole issue of segregation and separate but unequal really came to the forefront as I was going into the third or the fourth grade, what I had mentioned earlier about the community confronting the all-white school board, I think it raised a sensitivity and awareness about segregation and the difficulties that it presented to us in terms of having quality of education experience in terms of new textbooks and the best of equipment and what have you.  Yeah, I experienced it every day because we would pass by a number of schools that were much, much closer to home.
Story_ID: 203371
Speaker 1: And what kinds of things did you enjoy doing in high school [I.M. Terrell High School, Fort Worth, Texas]?
Speaker 2: I enjoyed meeting new people, beautiful young ladies--oh, my, beautiful young ladies, I enjoyed that.  But I, again I enjoyed the teachers. I just tell you, I just marvel over that today and even in my adult life and my professional life I've experienced a lot of interaction with, with professionals but I would tell you (unclear) there is not any that would be superior in terms of the--their professionalism and their commitment to the students as I experienced it there in my elementary years, in my junior high and my senior years.  Notwithstanding that the schools were segregated but it was just quality instruction.
Speaker 1: What were some of your favorite subjects in school?
Speaker 2: Math and English and civics, yeah.  And, and the teachers of those courses were just awe inspiring, yeah.  If fact, my English teacher was Mrs. Hands [ph.], I think I was in love with her at the age of nine.  She introduced me to poetry.  And I enjoyed that and then subsequently my high school English teacher, Mrs. Stevens [ph.], she was tough but, I enjoyed her too.  Math teacher Mr. McDaniel [ph.], and Mr. Sparks [ph.].  High school Mr. Logan [ph.] taught chemistry.  And for--Mrs. Campbell [ph.] taught algebra.  Miss Harris [ph.] taught Spanish, didn't do well in Spanish, too many girls in the classes (unclear).
Speaker 1: Couldn't concentrate?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they couldn't concentrate.  Yeah, but it was great.
Speaker 1: And at this time were you starting to have some dreams and aspirations about what you thought you wanted to do with your life?
Speaker 2: What I wanted I think at first was to go to college.  I was the first out of my family to, to go to college, and as a matter of fact, within the community of Mosier Valley [Texas], I was the third to go to college.  The first two as I mentioned earlier was, was Miss Vada Mae Johnson who was a relative, and Robert Blackburn, Jr. was a first cousin, he finished from Prairie View A&M [College of Texas; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas], I think, Vada Mae finished from Paul Quinn [College, Dallas, Texas], both, historically black college and universities [HBCU] there in the State of Texas.  So that, that gave me a lot of motivation and inspiration.  And had a young, another--there's others who attended college and universities from the community but I don't think they pursued it in terms of a degree.  One was Benny Ruth Smith [ph.] who attended the same school I attended, had a lot of influence on me going to Huston-Tillotson College [Huston-Tillotson University] in Austin, Texas, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what were you thinking that you wanted to do professionally?
Speaker 2: To get a job that pays well, no, (laughter) that's true.  I suppose I had not looked too far beyond the traditional type of employment, you know, teaching, maybe working for a small firm doing some work in the physical sciences, and that was pretty much it.  And this was the, the height of the Civil Rights Movement in the '60s [1960s] and I finished college before the Civil Rights Act of '64 [1964].  But even before that period of time there were some movements by the government under the Kennedy-Johnson Administration [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy; Vice President Lyndon Baines Johnson] to provide equal opportunity, if you will, for African Americans and other citizens who had been denied full access to employment opportunities in the federal government.  So there were a number of things that were taking place that sort of heightened my awareness as to what jobs I might ultimately seek.
Story_ID: 203372
Speaker 1: What were your thoughts in high school [I.M. Terrell High School, Fort Worth, Texas] about college?  What were you thinking about college?
Speaker 2: I wanted very much to attend college.  As again, there was a limited number of individuals in the community [Mosier Valley, Texas] who had gone to college so there was not a lot of discussion about that among many of my relatives and others but I knew I wanted to go to college.  All the members of the community would say that education is sort of the key to success.  There was a young lady who was a grade ahead of me in Mosier Valley [School, Euless, Texas] who attended college and we were really close Benny Ruth Smith [ph.] and she encouraged me to consider Huston-Tillotson College [Huston-Tillotson University, Austin, Texas] where she was a student, and I did.  But I knew I wanted to go to college.  But there was a question about having the resources, you know, to pay for the tuition and room and board, books (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: And what were, what were your parent--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: What were your parents [Bethel Lee Blackburn Stanton and Alvin Stanton] saying about college?
Speaker 2: Wanted me very much to go but also had questions about where--who was gonna pay the bills.  But my mother was not reluctant to, to encourage me under, under all circumstances to pursue the opportunity of going to college, and that she would continue to seek the necessary resources as well as my father in order to pay for college.  And obviously during the summer months I would work and save money for the coming school year as well.
Speaker 1: So you made the--okay.  So you made the decision to go to Huston-Tillotson.  And tell me a little bit about what your experiences were like there?
Speaker 2: Well, it was the first time I was away from home although, it's roughly a 180 miles from where I grew up, which at that time created to about a three hour drive--three and a half hour drive, but it was a good experience.  And, of course, I knew Betty [ph.], Betty Jean [ph.]--I mean Benny, Benny Ruth Smith [ph.] but there were also other students who graduated from I.M. Terrell [High School, Fort Worth, Texas], who were in my freshman class, so there were people I got to know there quite well.  And it--the faculty, the administrators were very, were very supportive of the students, wanna make sure that the freshmen get a good orientation, so after a period of time I felt comfortable there.  I was not able to have some of the spending change as some of my fellow students, didn't have the kind of wardrobe that many of them had but nevertheless I think I fit in quite well and to the extent that I was selected the president of my freshmen class so, (laughter) it worked out quite well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And tell me a little bit about some of the activities you were involved in, in college?
Speaker 2: College government, played baseball, and there was a series of clubs that I was a member of and eventually became the president of a lot of the clubs.  I, pledged Omega Psi Phi Fraternity and, and was very active in fraternity affairs.  But also we, I had a number of student organizations and students in general, who participated in sit-ins at some of the bus counters, theaters.  So we had spent a lot of time in downtown Austin, Texas attempting to integrate many of the public facilities.  And there was a coalition of students from Huston-Tillotson with the students from University of Texas [at Austin, Austin, Texas] again attempting to integrate the, the public facilities but they did not integrate, did not integrate until after the 1964, Civil Rights Act.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember any particular sit-in in particular?
Speaker 2: Yes, the theaters, the bus counters, there was--violence did not erupt as it had in some of the other cities that involved our counterparts, you know, in school.  But nevertheless the owners or the proprietors of these establishments were, were insistent that they would not integrate and they did not integrate, okay.
Speaker 1: And so they would just have you all removed by the police (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Removed, that's right.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: It was relatively peaceful.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Story_ID: 203373
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit when then-secretary, Interior Secretary [sic. Secretary of the Interior] Stewart Udall came to Huston-Tillotson [College; Huston-Tillotson University, Austin, Texas] to speak to the students.
Speaker 2: Yes.  He did not come personally--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but Stewart Udall from Arizona had served one or two terms in [U.S.] Congress and he was appointed by President [John Fitzgerald] Kennedy and Vice President [Lyndon Baines] Johnson to serve as their secretary of the interior.  And shortly after he was sworn into office, he looked at the work force of the Interior Department [sic. U.S. Department of the Interior] and actually had gone to the directors of the various bureaus and offices and inquired as to what was the composition of their workforce.  Of course, at that time we were not using the expression to any large degree African Americans or black it was probably Negro or colored employees but he was not satisfied at all with the kind of representation that existed which was nil for all practical purposes.  So he made a decision to move Interior into a new day and because Interior employs a large number of college students and teachers and others to work in the national parks and wildlife refuges during the summer months when they accommodate a lot of visitors, you know, to Yellowstone [National Park] or to Glacier [National Park] or other parks that are very popular during the summer for vacation purposes and what have you, so he did not defer to the bureau heads to do the recruiting, he said, "I will recruit for you through my own staff."  So he established a cadre of recruiters and instructed them to go into places or into colleges and universities which heretofore, Interior had never actively recruited, the historically black colleges and universities [HBCU] located throughout the southern and the Midwestern and eastern states.  And they recruited--came to Huston-Tillotson College and went directly to the president and said this is a new day we realize we have not been on your campus before and want you Mr. President to recommend students who you think could represent themselves well, represent the college well and go into an environment where that they may still confront some hostility and may not be fully accepted within the park or the refuge or within the adjoining community, good, bad, or indifference, the president recommended me.  I was a--I had just completed my, my junior year and he also had recommended four other graduating seniors.  I believe in the summer of '62 [1962] there were five of us from Huston-Tillotson College who worked in various parks, Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado, Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Parks in Wyoming.
Speaker 1: So and tell me a little bit about how, so you decided you were gonna, you know, take this summer job--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and go to Wyoming.  And just tell me a little bit about the process involved in getting there.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, I certainly felt very humble and very honored by the confidence that then the late Dr. J.J. Seabrook [Dr. John Jarvis Seabrook], president of the college and his dean, Dr. John [Quill] Taylor King [Sr.], had in me along with the other, my fellow students to be the ones that could represent ourselves and the college in this new environment as rangers in the national parks.  And the recruiter advised the president and us that, that if we accept this opportunity our appointment would be confirmed personally by the secretary of the interior.  So we felt very, very proud of that.  But the recruiter also said that you, the student, would have to underwrite your initial expenses of traveling from home to the park, and you would need to have a uniform purchased before you arrive in the park, and you need to have sufficient money to provide for your food and other necessities for two weeks before you get your first paycheck.  And I said "Whoa!" Now things began to look a little different, and costed it out and I needed as a minimum, $250 to, to meet all those needs including the train fare the uniform and what have you.  And $250 in 1962 with a mother [Bethel Lee Blackburn Stanton] working in a cafe and a father [Alvin Stanton] doing farm work this was not easy to come by.  So I went to, and not to, I said my father, I should back up.  My father was, was killed in--he died in August of '59 [1959] roughly three weeks before I entered as a freshman at the Huston-Tillotson College.  So the only support I had financially was my mother and my siblings and my brother-in-laws but they too, you know, had difficulties in terms of income.  So I went to a gentleman whom I had worked for along with my father on his dairy farm, a gentleman by the name of Alton Harden [ph.] who died I believe in 1988, and he said, "Bob, I don't have this kind of money right here, what I will do for you though, I will cosign a note at the Arlington State Bank," and which he did, and I got a check for $250 and I said, you know, "pay you back over a period of weeks or months," you know, on installment.  So I got the money and bought me a train ticket and off to Grand Teton National Park.
Story_ID: 203374
Speaker 1: Was that your first time being so far away from Texas?
Speaker 2: That was my first time out of the State of Texas, my first time on a train, my first time ever going to a national park, yeah, so it was quite an experience.
Speaker 1: And what was the experience like traveling west?
Speaker 2: It was quite an experience, you know.  Yeah, not knowing what to expect but having--feeling pretty confident you could handle it regardless what came about--that is having the--having confidence that there are some good people out there that wanna help you along the way, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so tell us what happened.  So you get to Wyoming, you step foot off the train, you're in Wyoming, what do you do next?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I took the train and from Colorado and I stopped in Greeley, Colorado to buy the uniform, did that, got back on the train and continued to Rock Springs, Wyoming.  And from there took a bus from Rock Springs, Wyoming to Jackson, Wyoming.  It so happened I had not really planned my itinerary as tightly as I should because I arrived in Jackson one day before I was actually going to the [Grand Teton National] Park, and so I said, "Well, you know, I've spent all my money on the train and at least I can find a black family here, you know, maybe put me up."  So I inquired at some of the shops, they said, "Well, we don't why, but there's no black families here in Jackson," (laughter).  I said "Whoa, what am I going to do?"  So I went to a pharmacy and I don't why, but just struck up a relationship with the gentleman who was working there, just so happened that he owned the pharmacy plus he had some rental units.  He said well you must be one of the rangers, the word had gotten apparently that there were gone be some black faces in Grand Teton National Park so everyone sort of knew that it was a new day, he said I'll just put you up and you pay me back when, when you can.  And I'll never forget that, yeah.  So it worked out fine.
Speaker 1: What was that summer like for you?
Speaker 2: It was great.  I, I met some of the finest people in the National Park Service [NPS] as well as some of the native Wyomians who operated ranches there because on my lieu days I worked with Jerry Jacobson [ph.] and his family who managed the ranch there helping them put up hay to get some extra income but very, very fine.  But the people, the administrators of Grand Teton in 1962 had a tremendous impact and influence on me during my entire career, thirty-five years with the National Park Service.  It was just an outstanding cadre of professionals who were at Grand Teton at that time, which made a world of difference.
Story_ID: 203375
Speaker 1: After that summer [working in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming] you went back to Austin [Texas] and finished out your senior year of college [Huston-Tillotson College; Huston-Tillotson University, Austin, Texas]?
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: And what did you do after that in 1963?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't have a job lined up when I graduated in May of '63 [1963] from Huston-Tillotson, so I had been recommended, you know, for future employment with the [National] Park Service [NPS] as a ranger in Grand Teton.  So in the absence of any permanent job, I said well, I will return to Grand Teton and work.  And it must have been--I entered on duty after I graduated probably early June, and perhaps around mid-July I received a call from the headquarters of the park and the message was to call Dr. [John Jarvis] Seabrook there at Huston-Tillotson, I said, "Whoa what is this all about?"
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I just got my degree.  But I called and Dr. Seabrook said, "Bob, we are proud of you and your leadership here as a student, and we would like to have you come back as a member of my staff, plus we'll underwrite some graduate work in the field of public relations, public communication."  So I did a year of graduate work at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] and then returned to Huston-Tillotson and worked as the director of public relation and alumni affairs and did subbing for some of the teachers when they were out, and it was a great experience.
Speaker 1: And so were you thinking that, you know, you really wanted to get back into the park service and that you really wanted to pursue a career there?
Speaker 2: Well, I was still a little bit uncertain in terms of what was taking place in the federal government.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Because it was still fairly well understood, notwithstanding the early action by, by Secretary [of the Interior Stewart] Udall, that you still did not see many African Americans that were in managerial supervisory categories in the federal government, so you still didn't have those kinds of role models so to speak, so I didn't think that much about looking at a career in the federal government.  But again speaking about having confidence and being able to interact with people who really want to help, when I spoke earlier about working on the, on the ranch with Jerry Jacobson's [ph.] family, the ranch had a lady--there was a lady who had an interest in the ranch who lived in New York, and spent her summers in the park at the ranch by the name of Elysis S. Untermeyer [ph.].
Speaker 1: Could you spell Untermeyer for us?
Speaker 2: U-N-T-E-R-M-E-Y-E-R, Untermeyer. She lived in New York during the, during the fall and winter.  And I was on an official to New York while working at Huston-Tillotson College so I made a courtesy call on her, I believe she lived on Fifth Avenue.  And I visit with her and she was saying, "[HistoryMaker] Bob [Robert Stanton], you know," this is 1960, that would have been '64 [1964]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Sixty-four [1964], '65 [1965], said, "Things really are beginning to open in the federal government now and you just may wanna take a look at things."  So, I took her to heart and I made an inquiry with those whom I had worked in Grand Teton, many had been reassigned to other parks, but to make a long story short, Jack Davis [ph.] I believe, who was the, assistant chief ranger at Grand Teton when I was there, referred me to an official in the national office in personnel and he got in touch with me and I eventually came on board as a permanent employee in 1966.
Story_ID: 203376
Speaker 1: What were you doing for the [National] Park Service [NPS] in 1966?
Speaker 2: My first appointment was in personnel management and public information.
Speaker 1: And you held that position until 1969?
Speaker 2: Until 1969 and then I was reassigned to, to the National Capital Region [NCR] in a park position as a management assistant.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I served in that position until 1970.  Our director of the park service at that time did something similar to, to what [Secretary of the Interior] Stewart Udall did, he looked at the faces of all of his superintendents from South Pacific to Maine, from Alaska to the U.S. Virgin Islands, and did not see one black face among the hundreds of superintendents.  And he too said, "This is a new day," and he and my regional director at that time and--he conferred with the regional director and also with his deputy director and said that we were going to make an appointment and I have the distinction of being, and I say this with all humility, of being the first African American to be appointed by the park service as a park superintendent.  The thing that's so interesting is that two individuals who made a--who played a very prominent role in that appointment, were two gentlemen who was at Grand Teton National Park [Wyoming] in '62 [1962], the original director, Russell Dickenson, when I was appointed superintendent, was my first chief ranger.  And the gentleman who was the number two for the whole of the park service working with Director [George B.] Hartzog [Jr.], was [Harthon L.] Spud Bill who was the superintendent at Grand Teton, so they had a lot of influence on me.  But I might mention the other thing about the Teton experience.  As I mentioned earlier, Secretary Udall directed his staff to recruit among a fairly large number of historically black colleges and universities [HBCU], and one of the colleges they attended was Livingstone College in Salisbury, North Carolina.  And I don't know how many students were selected but one I know that was selected from there, William D. Kennard [ph.] another good Omega [Psi Phi Fraternity] man I might add, also worked in Grand Teton '62 [1962] and '63 [1963].  And when I came to the Washington [D.C.] area in 1966 for my permanent job, William was a bachelor, and I was a bachelor then, and so we were about to go out on the town here in Washington and he said, "Hey [HistoryMaker] Bob [Robert Stanton], there's this young lady that just finished from Livingstone, she's now working at HUD, [U.S. Department of] Housing and Urban Development, and I've been dating a girl from Livingstone," he said, "why don't we just double date?"  I said, "Sounds great to me William," you know.  You probably getting two or three dates this week, you know.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That would be the first of many--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --this week, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So the next thing I know, William was my best man; his brother was in the ministry and his brother was administering the wedding. But Teton has had a lasting experience on me but probably the best because I married Janet Moffatte [Stanton] of South Carolina and the best thing that ever happened to me, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's great.
Speaker 2: Thirty-eight years of marriage, yeah.
Story_ID: 203377
Speaker 1: Once you were appointed superintendent of the Virgin Islands National Park in St. Thomas [sic. St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands], tell us what that was like for you, you know, you were the first African American in this position.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: As a superintendent did you feel a lot of pressure, did you feel like the expectations were extraordinarily high?
Speaker 2: I suppose I felt that they were high because the expectations of myself were relatively high.  I guess I was surprised by the pace at which I moved from one superintendency to another.  I was appointed superintendent of National Capital Parks-East, which has a number of parks within southeast Washington [D.C.] plus in Prince George's [County] and Charles County of Maryland, including the Frederick Douglass Home [Frederick Douglass National Historic Site, Washington, D.C.] and Anacostia Park [Washington, D.C.], Fort Washington [Park, Fort Washington, Maryland], Piscataway [Park, Accokeek, Maryland], all are grouped under one superintendent.  And I accepted that position in 1970 and I had been in the job perhaps less than a year, when I received the call from Director [George B.] Hartzog [Jr.] saying, Bob I need you in the [U.S.] Virgin Islands.  And I attempted to argue--not argue, I was attempting to plead my, my views with the director, Director Hartzog, I told him that I had just moved into my first superintendency, my wife [Janet Moffatte Stanton] had a budding career with HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development], we had a daughter, Rhonda [Stanton], I think Rhonda was two and a half or three years of age.  We had fulfilled that American dream by saving up our nickel and dime, bought our first home out in Prince George's County [Maryland].  And he said, "Bob, I understand, but why don't you and your bride," he always called the wives brides, "why don't you and your bride go down to the Virgin Islands for a week or so and look around then come back and let me know."  And, of course, I knew then that I would be headed to the Virgin Islands, but it was one of the best, best assignments I had had.  One of things that was of a little concern to me is that in my first superintendency I was in close proximity to the regional office so I could get good advice and technical assistance and what have you, as I--as a new superintendent moving into that area of increased responsibility.  But here I was reassigned to the U.S. Virgin Islands which means I was on my own so to speak, notwithstanding you had the telephone and other forms of communication but you couldn't just get in your car and go next door and say, "I need your help on a certain issue."  But it, it forced me in a situation where I had to mature very rapidly in terms of my own managerial and supervisory capability but again, the staff and the community, the government, under the late Melvin [H.] Evans, governor of Virgin Islands, just absolutely fantastic.  I enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: And what would you say was your biggest accomplishment there?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I succeeded in what Director Hartzog asked I do, is to improve, substantially improve the relationship between the National Parks [National Park Service (NPS)] and the local government and the community and to work out some cooperative agreements that allowed for the Virgin Islands government to make use of some of the resources to meet some of their needs, which was the case in Christiansted [National Historic Site] on St. Croix [U.S. Virgin Islands].  And also to involve more of the native Virgin Islands in the recreational educational program, as well to improve the employment in the National Parks Service of native Virgin Islanders, and to make substantial improvements to the overall management of the park in terms of caring for the resources, enhancing the visitor experience.  And it was just a great opportunity and I really enjoyed working with the community.  And one of the things I'll cherish is I was invited to be--I was selected to be the keynote speaker for the junior high school graduation there on St. John [U.S. Virgin Islands] and sort of gave an indication that, that the relationship was, was improving.  Also I hosted a formal visit by a congressional subcommittee to come into the park and to sort of inspect how the park was going and to set some of the needs for more money, land acquisition, operational development.  And, and invited the community to join with me in hosting a Virgin Islands style picnic in honor of the congressional visit and they turned out in large numbers, and it was absolutely poetry in motion.
Story_ID: 203378
Speaker 1: --Let's talk a little bit about what you did after that when you became the deputy regional director of the Southeast Region [of the National Park Service (NPS)] in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yes.  That, that came as a great opportunity, somewhat of a surprise because I had anticipated perhaps moving from the [U.S.] Virgin Islands into a, another superintendent perhaps with increased level of responsibility.  I don't know you're aware of how the grade structure of the federal government but the Virgin Islands National Park [St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands] was a GS-14 and I had thought there I would go into a GS-14 or GS-15 park somewhere else but I was selected to become the deputy regional director after spending two and a half years in the [U.S.] Virgin Islands which means that I had--I was number two in charge of the entire Southeast Region that included all the parks in eight southern states plus Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands National Park.
Speaker 1: And where did that rank on the scale?  GS what?
Speaker 2: It was a GS-15.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  So I moved, moved rapidly.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what do you think was your biggest accomplishment there?
Speaker 2: Working with the regional director, whom I worked very closely with and we had a great relationship, Dave Thompson; he's since retired and he lives in New Mexico, but activating some of the new areas that had been established by [U.S.] Congress.  You know, during the period of time that I was in the Virgin Islands and there in Atlanta, the Martin Luther King [Jr.] National Historic Site [Atlanta, Georgia] as an example of big sites was Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site [Tuskegee, Alabama].  And I recall working with the late Dr. [Luther H.] Foster and his assistant president I guess for development, Doug Covington [Dr. H. Douglas Covington], who is now the president of Radford University in--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --in [Radford] Virginia.  It just--I enjoyed it very much.  And carrying out a lot of different programs throughout the region.  It's a vast region with probably no less than fifty to sixty parks like Everglades [National Park, Florida] and Blue Ridge Parkway, Natchez Trace Parkway, it's a great region.  Excuse me, just one minute.
Speaker 1: Sure.  Let's pause.
Speaker 2: You can pause right here.
Speaker 1: So and you held that position from 1974 to 1976 when you went back to Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: And what did you do when, when you went back?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was home on a Saturday there in Atlanta and got a call from then Director Gary Everhardt, said, "Bob, I need you in Washington."  I said, "Gary," I said, "I'm enjoying Atlanta," yeah, "Bob, come on up to Washington."  And he had gone through a reorganization and established three assistant directors under an associate director.  Sort of the organizational hierarchy of the park service, you have the director, deputy director, and associates and then associates may have assistants.  And I was selected as one of the assistant directors for operation in the Gary Everhardt tenure as the director.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And served there for two years, I think roughly two years.
Story_ID: 203379
Speaker 1: From 1978 until 1986 you were the deputy regional director of the National Capital Region [(NCR) of the National Park Service (NPS)]?
Speaker 2: Yes, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what area did that encompass?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was my second deputy job.  Even though the Southeast Region a much, much larger region in terms of the geography and the numbers of states but the National Capital Region, which is the smallest of the ten regions, had the intensity of the operation and the visibility because you're here in the nation's capital [Washington, D.C.] and the environment.  Was a great experience and I served in that position for eight years and often acted for the regional director.  The regional director he had suffered a severe heart ailment and I acted for probably a year and half but he and I were, I would say, closer than brothers or as close as brothers, Manus [John] Jack Fish [Jr.].  And I served for--served under him for eight years as a deputy, yeah, and I think we got a lot accomplished, yeah.
Speaker 1: Like what?  What do you think is some of the major accomplishments?
Speaker 2: Well the, the rehabilitation of the monuments, memorials, new memorials was established such as the, the Vietnam Veteran Memorial [Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Washington, D.C.].  Major improvements to the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, the George Washington Memorial Parkway, Suitland Parkway, improving a number of operations through corporate agreements, working with Wolf Trap Foundation for the Performing Arts [Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts, Vienna, Virginia], Ford's Theatre Society [Ford's Theatre, Washington, D.C.], working closely with the [Washington] D.C. government, and I enjoyed working with the late [William H.] Bill Rumsey [Sr.] who was the director of D.C. [Department of] Park[s] and Recreation his successor, [F.] Alexis [H.] Roberson.  And we did a lot of great things together with respect to River Fest [Anacostia River Festival, Anacostia Park, Washington, D.C.], sharing equipment across organizational lines.  And I worked very, very closely with Dr. Dorothy Irene Height [HistoryMaker Dorothy Height], a lady that I just love dearly in, inaugurating the first black family reunion on the Washington Monument grounds [Washington, D.C.], and I was the point person working with her and then former mayor, [HistoryMaker] Mayor Marion Barry and his staff.  And that was a great, great opportunity, yeah.
Story_ID: 203380
Speaker 1: We were talking a little bit about your position as the regional, the deputy regional director of the National Capital Region [(NCR) of the National Park Service (NPS)].  And so in 1987 you came back to--well, were back--assigned back at headquarters as the associate director for operations.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: So can you tell us a little bit about what you did in that position?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That is one of the principal associates in the National Park Service and the responsibility would be the principal advisor to the director and to the deputy director on all matters related to the day to day management operation of all the parks as well as providing technical support to the regional directors and in turn to the superintendents.  And, of course, it requires a lot of coordination not only with my counterparts in the, the park service but also working with other agencies, Environmental Protection Agency [EPA], [U.S.] Department of Transportation, Labor Department [sic. U.S. Department of Labor] with respect to Job Corps centers that the park service operate.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So, it was a multifaceted job that required a lot of coordination but had a, had the benefit of a highly dedicated, motivated staff.
Speaker 1: And were you thinking, you know, at this point in your career that someday you, you would be the director of the park service?
Speaker 2: No, I--my aspiration was somewhat tiered I suspect.  After becoming a management assistant I was hoping that one day I'd become a superintendent.  And then after I became a superintendent I said well, maybe one day I'll make that regional directorship.  And then I said well, you know, maybe associate but it had not dawned on me as a director of the National Park Service.  But my name came up as a potential candidate for the directorship while I was the regional director for the National Capital Region.
Speaker 1: And it happened in 1988?  And it happened in 1988, correct?
Speaker 2: As, as the, I was appointed regional director in 1988.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: The regional director for National Capital Region, that's correct.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so when did you become the director of the National Park Service?
Speaker 2: I was confirmed by the United States Senate the latter part of July of 1997 and sworn into office by Secretary [of the Interior Bruce] Babbitt, I believe, on August 4, 1997, and served for the balance of the [President William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton administration.
Speaker 1: And can you tell us a little bit about how that came about?
Speaker 2: Well, a number of people apparently had been observing my performance as the regional director of the National Capital Region and because of the proximity of the regional director to the White House [Washington, D.C.] to the [U.S.] Capitol [Washington, D.C.] and certainly to the secretary of the interior, had a lot of interaction with the leadership of, of the Clinton-Gore [Vice President Al Gore] administration, and a lot of interaction in a bipartisan way with members of [U.S.] Congress.  And I believe, that Secretary Babbitt had a great deal of confidence in my ability to assume the directorship, and certainly I think that was shared by President Clinton but also I had worked very closely with then our First Lady, Mrs. [Hillary Rodham] Clinton, particularly in Save America's Treasures, and I was also a chairman of the White House, the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, working very closely with Mrs. Clinton there and--
Speaker 1: And what, can you tell us about Save America's Treasures, what, what exactly?
Speaker 2: Yeah it was a program I think pretty much was the, was designed by, by, by Mrs. Clinton and her staff, that is to join with the National Park Service, join with the National Trust for Historic Preservation [Chicago, Illinois], join the National Park Foundation and other agencies of the federal government that have responsibility for caring for some of our irreplaceable historic resources, Smithsonian Institution [Washington, D.C.] as an example.  And it was really two-fold, one was to create more public awareness about the rich diversity of, of our culture, of our history, going from Harriet Tubman Home in [Auburn] New York to Mesa Verde structures, pre-Columbian structures, if you will, in [Mesa Verde National Park] Colorado, to increase public awareness about our rich history.  But by the same token also invite--provide an opportunity for private citizens as well as corporations and nonprofits to contribute towards the preservation of these resources.  I recall Mrs. Clinton and I hosting a distinguished corporate leader at Thomas Edison National Historical Park in East [sic. West] Orange, New Jersey.  That corporate executive was Jack Welch of General Electric who made on behalf of General Electric a generous donation towards the preservation of Thomas Edison library and laboratory of five million dollars.  So it was that kind of effort again to get corporate America and private citizens to contribute toward the preservation of our collective heritage.  It was just a great, great opportunity.
Story_ID: 203381
Speaker 1: And tell us a little bit about the nomination process for director of the National Park Service [NPS].
Speaker 2: Yes.  Up until 1996, the appointment of an individual to the director of the National Park Service was solely at the discretion of the president and the secretary of the interior, because the, the director answers to the secretary through an assistant secretary.  But [U.S.] Congress passed legislation in 1996 that set forth some minimum requirements for the director and it also stipulated that the future director, any future director of the National Park Service would be subject to [U.S.] Senate confirmation.  So I was the first director to, to go through that process.  But before your name--before a nominee's name is formally submitted to the president, to the senate for formal consideration, the president obviously wants to be comfortable that he has all the information about that candidate--about that nominee, so consequently there is an extensive what they call a vetting process and a background that includes a background investigation by the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], the, the RES [sic. Internal Revenue Service (IRS)] and others to make sure that you are a responsible citizen.  So that is a long drawn out process.
Speaker 1: They don't want any skeletons falling out the closet.
Speaker 2: No, that's right.  And the FBI as a part of their background investigation inquires with your neighbors and with friends and former supervisors, what have you, and but it all worked out that the President [William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] was ultimately satisfied that I had no major skeleton, at least that come to the forefront but my name was formally submitted to the senate.  The senate had hearings on my nomination along with others.  But one of the things I'm very proud of is having worked with members of congress for a number of years and recognizing that the senators extend a courtesy to the--albeit a committee--extend courtesies to their fellow senators to offer testimony on behalf of a given nominee.  So I had asked two distinguished, two outstanding--first of all it was two outstanding Americans and two outstanding senators to offer comments before their peers on my behalf, Senator Paul Sarbanes of Maryland and Senator John [William] Warner of Virginia, and both appeared--they appeared together before the committee and I was very pleased with their testimony.  But shortly after appearing before the committees, my nomination moved through the process quite rapidly, perhaps within a month and a half from the time that the president submitted my name to the time that I was actually confirmed and then sworn in by Secretary [of the Interior Bruce] Babbitt.
Speaker 1: And you were confirmed unanimously?
Speaker 2: Unanimously by the senate, right.
Speaker 1: And was there ever any doubt that you would, in fact, be confirmed in your mind?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's an interesting process in any senator, any one of the one hundred, can put what they call a hold on the nomination until they're satisfied.  And two senators put a hold on my nomination.  All politics, I mean, are local. Senator [Wayne] Allard from Colorado put a hold on it until he was satisfied that I would deal with an issue that he was not--that had displeased him some months or some years before with respect to a foot race in a national park area, and I assured him that, you know, I would look at it and to the best of my ability take care of it.  He said, "[HistoryMaker] Bob [Robert Stanton], I believe you'll do that.  So I redeem my hold."  The other was with former senator, Senator [Duncan McLauchlin "Lauch"] Faircloth from North Carolina.  He was dismayed with the park service about not keeping a road open in Great Smokies Mountain National Park [sic. Great Smoky Mountains National Park, North Carolina and Tennessee].  He--his view was, "I don't care how much it snows, Bob, I want you as the director to keep that road open."  I said, "We'll do the best we can, Senator."  He said, "Okay I'll release the hold."  So it worked out fine.  And--but I enjoy that process.  I really do.  I really do.

Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about some of your accomplishments as director [of the National Park Service (NPS)]?
Speaker 2: Well, again, a director, any, any, any accomplishment as a superintendent, management assistant, regional director, or associate director, or director, is in direct proportion to the support that you get from your staff and their motivation and their interest, and I had the best group of federal employees in the National Park Service whom I worked with daily and I think we accomplished a great deal.  We accomplished a great deal on several fronts.  One is in working directly with [U.S.] Congress to get new authorizations that allow for more revenues to be available to the park service to, to meet some of those needs and congress authorized new legislative authorities for the park service to have more resources at its disposal, and I was very pleased with some of those legislative accomplishments.  Also further to congress, congress during my tenure as director approved nine new parks, extended the boundary of I think twenty-something parks.  And two parks that came into the system while I was director speak specifically to events associated with African Americans. Little Rock Central High School [National Historic Site, Little Rock, Arkansas], which is very close to me because the nine students who integrated Little Rock Central High School [Little Rock, Arkansas] in 1957 were my peers, and that now is a national historic site.  And the Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site [Tuskegee, Alabama] to commemorate the bravery of those fighters notwithstanding that the [U.S.] Army or the [U.S.] military was segregated but yet they still fought valiantly in World War II [WWII].  But I also I was very proud that congress passed legislation authorizing the [National] Underground Railroad Network to Freedom and it was my great joy--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --to be invited by President [William Jefferson "Bill] Clinton to join along with a number of other distinguished citizens including Rodney [E.] Slater who was secretary of transportation at that time, Congressman Carl Stokes [sic. Ambassador Carl Stokes], (unclear) and others to witness him personally signing the Underground Railroad Network to Freedom.  And but also on the operational side, I think we improved the quality of interpretation, the visitor experiences when one goes to the park.  One of the passions I have is to increase the involvement of young people in a program we inaugurated we call the Public Lands Corps that provided for the expanded involvement of young people.  We expanded the Parks Classroom Program.  We improved the safety of our employees in the work place.  I was very concerned about the number of lost time injuries of our employees suffering back strains or automobile accidents and what have you, so substantially improved that.  And certainly the construction of new facilities and the upgrading and maintenance of facilities.  Major conservation projects included the restoration of the Everglades National Parks [sic. Everglades National Park, Florida], an agreement to remove some dams out of Olympic National Park in Washington State, alternate transportation systems at the Zion National Park in Utah, also at Acadia [National Park] in Maine.  So I think a number of major improvements were made over my roughly four years as the director of the park service.  Could have been more had I stayed in longer but that was not to be (laughter).
Speaker 1: And not your choice, not your decision.
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right.
Story_ID: 203383
Speaker 1: Can you talk a little bit about some of the--were there any controversial issues at the time where, when you were director [of the National Park Service (NPS)], you know, I know sometimes the ATB [America the Beautiful Passes] and--
Speaker 2: Yep--
Speaker 1: --in association, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes, so there were, one major controversy which I had not anticipated, I, you know, having spent so many years in park service I knew that there would be some glitches that I would have to be deal with fairly early on but this one became a much larger issue than I anticipated.  Again I was sworn into office on August 4, 1957, perhaps no less than a month and a half, because [U.S.] Congress is in recess, August. When congress reconvened--
Speaker 1: You said 1957 but you meant--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I'm talking (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety-seven [1997].
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety-seven [1997].
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety-seven [1997].  I was sworn in August, on August 4, 1997.  Congress then recessed at that time.  Congress came back in September.  Shortly thereafter I received a call from the chairman of the [U.S. House of Representatives] Subcommittee on Appropriations that really has a lot of influence in terms of the park service's viability in terms of having the financial resources to meet its obligation, and he was concerned about what he had been reading in the papers about the park service paying exorbitant prices to construct housing, employee housing, in Yosemite National Park [California] and Grand Canyon National Park [Arizona].  There was also a concern about the cost of a comfort facility, restroom, if you will, in Delaware Gap National Park [sic. Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, Bushkill, Pennsylvania].  And he said, "[HistoryMaker] Bob [Robert Stanton], I think we're gonna have some oversight hearings so I want you and your staff to come up and tell me why these things are costing so much."  And, of course, I, you know, when you assume a new position, you assume all that which occurred before you, that becomes your new, your pick as it were, so I could not have said, you know, "Well it happened on somebody's else watch." That what's I assumed.  We had some very intense oversight hearings.  This is--an oversight hearing is when congress convene a meeting where an agency go before that to defend its decisions and why it made the decisions to do thus and so using appropriated money.  And it was very, very intense tuck and go, to make a long story short, congress authorized that an independent study be done about how the park service carries out its planning, designing, construction program, and they filed a report that I concurred in Secretary [of the Interior Bruce] Babbitt concurred in, I concurred in, and it in essence resulted in to some reform in terms of how we conduct our business.  It was very time-consuming. I had not anticipated that happening on my watch so early on but we were able to address that.  One of the other programs that I introduced was so called Natural Resources Challenge [sic. Natural Resource Challenge].  I used the occasion of the 100th anniversary Mount Rainier National Park in Washington State to make that announcement.  And it was a recommitment and a public commitment that the National Park Service would do better in terms of its stewardship of all the natural resources entrusted to its care.  I'm talking about, you know, from the plants, large trees, to grizzly bears in Glacier National Park [Montana], and we made a commitment to do that.  And I asked my staff to develop a plan that will address that. It's a multi-year, multimillion dollar plan, and it was embraced in a bipartisan way by congress.  And it has been given substantial funding to meet that challenge and I'm very, very pleased with that, called the Natural Resource Challenge.
Story_ID: 203384
Speaker 1: Is there sometimes shock and surprise, when people meet you, to find an African American, you know, conservationist who--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --has been with the [National] Park Service [NPS] for many, many, many, many years--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, since 1962, right?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Are you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --somewhat of an anomaly?
Speaker 2: No, I was though in--along with just a handful of us in the early '60s [1960s].  But in looking at the, the number of African Americans who are in responsible positions throughout the National Park Service, I'm pleased that some progress has been made.  We still have ways to go even though there's a fairly significant percentage of superintendents who are African Americans, a regional director in the Southeast Region as African American, a female who succeeded an African American male is as the regional director.  There's been, including the current one, there have been three deputy directors, African Americans, and so there's been some changes made.  The other thing I might mention just in terms of the park system--when I say park system that is the sum of all the individual parks, monuments, and memorials--there are seventeen areas now in the system that specifically speak to African Americans or even that's associated with African Americans.  When I first worked as a seasonal ranger in Grand Teton [National Park] I think [U.S.] Congress had only authorized three up to that point in time, so that's very encouraging.  I think that there still is unfortunately a general perception by a large number of people that African Americans are not involved in conservation programs, and I'd like to see that diminished, I mean, that perception because that is not true (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Is that perception accurate though because a lot of times when you see conservationists and environmentalists, the face is not--
Speaker 2: The representation is still not there and consequently there is some basis of people having that conception.  But there is beginning to be some, some improvement.  Still have a ways to go.
Speaker 1: And do you think it's because there are more African Americans concentrated in urban environments so the appreciation isn't there because they really haven't been--the exposure level isn't there?
Speaker 2: You could take that position, but there are a number of areas that are now located in urban centers, Chattahoochee[-Oconee National Forest, Georgia] a portion of it is in, in the City of Atlanta [Georgia].  We have gateway in California, in San Francisco [California], I mean Golden Gate National Recreation Area in San Francisco, Gateway [National Recreation Area] in New York [and New Jersey], Cuyahoga [Valley] National Park located between Cleveland [Ohio] and Akron [Ohio].  So many of the parks are where the people are and you, and then those parks are experiencing an increased number of visitations by not only African Americans but other racial and ethnic groups who are within walking distance or thirty minute or an hour car drive to those parks.  But what we are not experiencing is a substantial increase of visitors, particularly African Americans going to some of the more remote park, Glacier [National Park] in Montana or Yellowstone [National Park] in Wyoming.  I think that there is some gradual increase in visitation but not on the scale that I would like to see.
Story_ID: 203385
Speaker 1: What do you think is the biggest challenge facing the [National] Park Service [NPS] or facing our national parks?
Speaker 2: I think there has to be a continuing effort on the part of the park service to create more awareness, appreciation, understanding by the full spectrum of the American public about the richness of these nearly four hundred areas in terms of their cultural and natural resources, that's one.  The other is to make sure that there is some sustainability to the revenue stream with respect to managing these parks.  It takes a lot of resources, a lot of efforts on the part of a motivated work staff.  If you think about managing and giving the best attention to roughly eighty-five million acres of land and all kinds of resources, builders, and what have you on those resources, the complexity of preserving say the, the [Gateway] Arch that is called in St. Louis [Missouri], that's the National Park Service.  The Statue of Liberty [New York, New York] that's park service.  The large number of Civil War battlefields, Revolutionary War battlefields, you think about pre-Columbian structures such as Mesa Verde [National Park, Colorado]: that all requires our highly skilled staff with the necessary materials and supplies and money but the park service has a dedicated staff out of its twenty thousand employees but there is a large number of partners who join with the park service in caring for those resources.  Oh, perhaps over three hundred concessioners who provide all kinds of hospitality services, lodging, recreational services: they're partners.  You have contractors who work under contract with the park service to provide certain construction activities.  And the park service I would say has the benefit of roughly a 115 to 120 thousand individual volunteers, people who give of themselves, coming into the parks to provide a valuable service.  Then [U.S.] Congress in 1968, I believe '69 [1969] established the National Park Foundation which is the principal and official partner to work with the private sector and others to raise money to assist the park service in meeting some of its obligation.  When I was regional director for the National Capital Regional [sic. National Capital Region (NCR)] then subsequently the director, I worked close with the park foundation in terms of Target stores contributing millions of dollars along with some of its partner corporations towards the preservation of the Washington Monument [Washington, D.C.].  Many of the parks are co-managed, if you will, through a corporate agreement, Piscataway Park [Accokeek, Maryland] that protects the views you get from Mount Vernon [Mount Vernon, Virginia], work closely with the Accokeek Foundation [Accokeek, Maryland].  All the theatrical production that's provided at the Ford's Theatre [Washington, D.C.] is held by the Ford's Theatre Society on an agreement with the park service.  If you were to go to a performance at Wolf Trap Farm Park [sic. Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts, Vienna, Virginia], which is a national park area, the performing arts activities are handled pursuant to an agreement between the Wolf Trap Foundation and the National Park Service.  So there's all kinds of partnerships that take place in the parks.
Story_ID: 203386
Speaker 1: As director of the [National] Park Service [NPS] because it was a political appointment--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and like I said you--what would you--what didn't you get the opportunity to do that you really wanted to do or would, or you really wanted to accomplish?
Speaker 2: Where should I start (laughter)?  As I said before, I wanted to make sure that our employees had the benefit of the highest quality of supervision, therefore our supervisors need to be the best trained available.  Our employees need to have the opportunity to develop their skills and increase their knowledge through training opportunities and certainly to improve safety within the work force.  So taking care of the men and women of the park service was one of the priorities.  Certainly to take care of the, the resources to preserve a Lincoln Memorial [Washington, D.C.] or a Grand Teton National Park, all of that is something that will always be high on any director's agenda.  And there were a number of deficiencies that we were not able to address.  But I think we had to establish a relationship with [U.S.] Congress, and certainly with the administration at the time to get improved or expanded authorities that allowed us to move ahead.  For instance, one of the authorities that we were able to accomplish was a doubling of the Federal Lands Highway funds to care for the over eight thousand miles of roads and hundreds and hundreds of bridges and as you know, to maintain any road system requires a lot of money.  But congress authorized the park service to receive a hundred and--about a $160 million annually, which we doubled as a result of the reauthorization.  And so I was pleased with some of those accomplishments, yeah.
Story_ID: 203387
Speaker 1: And what do you think needs to happen for more African Americans to become involved employment-wise in the [National] Park Service [NPS], and also just begin to gain an appreciation for all that's around them?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The park service has to be relentless in its efforts of communicating the value and the opportunities for every citizen to enjoy these parks.  Certainly every citizen will not have the opportunity to travel to all of the parks but certainly through the use of the Internet and other kinds of ways of conveying the message. We need to continue to do that.  I think again by working with the local regional and national media to tell the people that there is a, a Martin Luther King [Jr.] [National] Historic Site [Atlanta, Georgia], there is a Tuskegee [Airmen National Historic Site, Tuskegee, Alabama], there is a, a Brown v. Board of Education [National] Historic Site, [Topeka, Kansas], so people can understand that the park service is more than taking care of the bears and the trees, it also preserves our history, it tells something about us, and I think that more has to be done along those lines, because unfortunately there still is a lack of full knowledge throughout the country about the breadth of what the park service is all about.  And one of the ways to sort of diminish that, that, that knowledge gap is to continue to involve the young people through the Parks' Classrooms [sic. Park Classrooms Project], through hiring of young people in the parks, I think that will go a long way.
Story_ID: 203388
Speaker 1: Which is your favorite national park?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was a director [of the National Park Service (NPS)] I said I love all my children equally (laughter).  No, I--each park, I think has, has a certain niche within our country in terms of their intrinsic value.  Grand Teton National Park in all seriousness will always remain very dear because that's where it started, but then again from a heritage perspective, when I was the director and would be confronted with difficulties in terms of appearing before [U.S.] Congress on oversights or being called to the secretary's office or the White House [Washington, D.C.] on an issue, I never felt that I could not rise to the occasion because I grew the strength from some areas that were administered by the park service.  I drew my strength from my Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune or Frederick Douglass or [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] or Maggie Lena Walker or the Tuskegee Airmen, you know, if they could prevail then, why can't I? Yeah.  So they gave me a lot of inspiration.
Speaker 1: And have you visited every national park?
Speaker 2: No, I haven't.  So I got something to look forward to right (laughter).
Speaker 1: How many have you visited about, roughly?
Speaker 2: I would say about two-thirds of them, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Which, which ones are you most looking forward to visiting that you haven't visited before?
Speaker 2: I have not visited [National Park of] American Samoa and [War in the Pacific National Historical Park] Guam.  There are parks in those islands.  There are a number of parks associated with American Indians [Native American] in the great Southwest, some I have not visited.
Story_ID: 203389
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Robert] Stanton, let's talk a little bit about what you're currently doing.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You are currently, actually let's talk a little bit about your adjunct position at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut].
Speaker 2: Yes, right.  Shortly after I stepped down as the director of the [National] Park Service [NPS] in 2001, I was invited to give a lecture, a major lecture at Yale, at the School of Forestry & Environmental Studies.  And apparently the dean [J. Gustave Speth] and the students and the faculty enjoyed it, and the dean said, "Bob, well I'd like for you to come up and spend a semester with us.  You have the opportunity to design your own course, select the required reading materials for the students, as well as invite guest lecturers up." And I said, "Oh, sounds like a great opportunity," and, "I'd like for you to be in residency here," and I said, "yeah," and I said, "that's fine."  And also at that Yale at that time was the--just an outstanding gentleman whom I had worked with on a number of National Park Service programs and commissions, the late Dr. Robin [W.] Winks.  So, Robin and I discussed the course and we opted to co-instruct.  And we were in into the course, I guess, for the third week or so and Robin suffered a severe stroke and--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --later died.  But he was just a giant of a fellow.  But it was a great opportunity and I enjoyed interacting with the graduate students.  I had--
Speaker 1: What was the name of your course?
Speaker 2: National Parks: Lessons in Diversity, Environmental Quality, and Justice.
Speaker 1: And what was the gist of the course?
Speaker 2: Well to talk about the, the history of the establishment of parks, the history of establishing the park service but also talking about not only the, the biological diversity, and we talk about the biological diversity you talk about the different types of animals and trees that co-in--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --cohabit a given space, a piece of land.  But you're also talking diversity of the culture that's preserved in the parks, the American Indians [Native American], the native Alaskans, African Americans, Hispanic, Asian, to talk about that rich diversity.
Speaker 1: And I'm sure people are surprised that there's so much diversity (simultaneous) --
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --and preservation within the park.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Yeah, there still is a conception that when you say a national park or national park area what conjures up is Old Faithful and Yellowstone [National Park]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --or the fragility of the ecosystem in the Everglades [National Park, Florida] but people don't think about some of these other areas, and many of the other areas represent some of our cherished leaders such as George Washington Carver or Thomas Edison, but they also represent some of the more difficult periods in our history--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --the Civil War or the Civil Right Act and the atrocities that we committed against the American Indians, and we got areas to speak to that.  And the imprisonment of Japanese during World War II [WWII], we speak about that as a part of our history.  But it was a course that I really enjoyed.  I had first and second year master candidates and I believe three Ph.D. candidates, and a great class and we had a couple of field trips to present to them--to demonstrate to them, or to examine onsite how policies and programs actually carried out in a park environment.  So on the natural side we went to Cape Cod [National Seashore] in Massachusetts, and for the cultural side to Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty [National Monument] in New York [New York].  And so it was a great experience.  But concurrently with serving as the visiting professor at Yale in the fall of 2002, I had been appointed by IUCN, which is the International Conservation Union organization [sic. International Union for the Conservation of Nature] located in Gland, Switzerland where its headquarters at, which sponsors some on a ten year cycle World Park[s] Congresses.  And they had asked that I be an ambassador that is to visit with a number of individual organizations, foundations, raising awareness as well as raising money and in-kind services to support the world congress.  And that took place in September of 2003.  And six of my former students joined me there for the congress. It was absolutely great.
Story_ID: 203390
Speaker 1: Currently I'm a consultant to the Natural Resources Council of America, which is an umbrella organization for eighty-five of the major conservation organizations throughout the country, looking at some policy issues, organizational issues, looking at their diversity in terms of employment within the conservation community.  I serve on eight nonprofit boards and two boards that do make revenue so I am compensated by two boards, the rest of them is totally volunteer.
Speaker 2: Serve on ten and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are ten--
Speaker 2: --compensated by two.
Speaker 1: --ten boards and they keep me busy but I enjoy it.  And this fall, effective first week in September, I'll be a visiting professor at Texas A&M University [Texas Agricultural and Mechanical University] in College Station, Texas teaching a course similar as I did in Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], a graduate course and dealing with a number of the same topics that I dealt with at Yale, inviting guest lecturers as well.  And I look forward to that.

Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: One who did not dishonor my parents [Bethel Lee Blackburn Stanton and Alvin Stanton], my family, and certainly my ancestors.  And I hope that there will be some reminder of the goods that I, that I've left that becomes a foundation for our future generations to move further towards what we would describe in the Preamble [to the U.S. Constitution] as a more perfect union.
Story_ID: 203392
Speaker 1: And when you look back at your life what stands out the most to you and why?
Speaker 2: Oh, been so fortunate to have a lovely wife [Janet Moffatte Stanton] and two great kids [Braniff Stanton and Rhonda Stanton] and one great grandson and a family that still cares.  And that I have been given so much by so many people that helped me throughout my career that I hope I've been able to as [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] would say, help somebody along the way as well.
Speaker 1: And do you, do you ever wish you would have chosen a different career path?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do, I do.
Speaker 1: What would it have been?
Speaker 2: Probably the law.  Yeah I, yeah, what field of law, I'm not quite sure.  I--probably the civil rights I would suspect.  I wish I would have gone into law.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, you know, what do you think, you know, as you said, you know, your mother and your father you--really wanted you to go to college and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --what do you think, especially your father would have thought about, you know, here, you know, his son, who used to help him--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, with that hey, (unclear) you know, becoming the first African American director of the [National] Park Service [NPS]?
Speaker 2: I think he'd been very proud.  It would, it would take--he perhaps would not have understood all that was involved but I think he would have been very proud.  I think my father, as I said before, had a tremendous wealth of knowledge but in terms of his formal training, it was very limited but I think he would have been, been, very proud, yeah.
Speaker 1: And do you have any regrets, anything you wish you would have done differently?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  And they will remain with me.
Speaker 1: I was gonna say anything you care to share (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).

Speaker 1: What would you like for your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Legacy to be--
Speaker 1: Or what do you think your legacy will be?
Speaker 2: I don't know, maybe just--it seem like I the only thing I--is my reputation--that I didn't do anything to dishonor those who have given me so much.  Yeah, that's probably the best I can hope for.
Speaker 1: And is there anything else you'd like to add that maybe we didn't touch on the second time?
Speaker 2: No, I say well, just a great opportunity to be with you and I just wanna commend The HistoryMaker[s] organization for what you're doing because I think it's so important that we record the accomplishment of those who have contributed in some way.  And I would think I hopefully have contributed in some small way to the better understanding of what the [National] Park Service [NPS] and the parks are all about, that I've been able to encourage my young people to pursue careers in conservation and historic preservation, a field in which there has never--have not been today a large number of African Americans and in other racial and ethnic groups.  And I think there is so many rewards, so many great opportunities to be experienced that people pursuing with careers in those areas.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Robert] Stanton.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, thank you.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
