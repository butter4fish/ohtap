Speaker 1: Okay, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is November 29, 2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are on the campus of the California Institute of Technology.
Story_ID: 23554
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask and only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Not really, to be honest.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Not really, either.
Speaker 1: I'm tempted to ask if you have a favorite material, but I'm not even going to ask that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there you go.  I do, actually.
Speaker 1: --Well, what is it, what is it?
Speaker 2: Cerium dioxide. (laughing)
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I certainly enjoy Spring, yeah, when it's lots of flowers out.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Hawaii.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I like Einstein's saying about "99 percent perspiration, one percent inspiration".
Story_ID: 23555
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side and your father's side to keep them, you know, straight.  And then we'll put them together.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Misrak, M-I-S-R-A-K; Mare, M-A-R-E; and Haile, H-A-I-L-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't know her date of birth.  Her place of birth is Ethiopia, probably Addis Ababa [Ethiopia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, can you kind of guess where she was born?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth--she's--let me see, she's, let's say, about 19--let's see, maybe 50, maybe 19, yeah, about 1950.
Speaker 1: 1950?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's around 62.  Maybe a little bit older, so maybe between 45 and 50.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And my dad is between--
Speaker 1: Okay.  We'll get to him.  Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family.  How far back can you trace them, and what did they do?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  So we don't have so much family oral history.  So, my grandmother, my mother's mother, is still alive.  They were somewhat landowners in the countryside, so relatively well off financially in a poor country.  My grandfather died when he was quite young, so I did not meet him.  In fact, his youngest daughter, one of my aunts, I don't think she--she may not have--she has no memory of him.  So he died relatively young.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I don't know what his occupation was.
Speaker 1: Okay, but he owned the land that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, both parents together.  So, I knew my grandmother as, you know, landowner in the countryside, so, we'd go and see this property when we were kids.
Speaker 1: --Okay.  Now, what were your grandparents' names?
Speaker 2: Why am I blanking?  Again, I don't know my grandfather's name.  I should have looked this up for you.  My grandmother's name--you see that we--I mean, we came here when I was young, so I never see her, and I would just refer to her as grandmother.  It's--
Speaker 1: Is she still in Ethiopia?
Speaker 2: --Yes, she is.  It means goat.  Workenesh.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, what is it?
Speaker 2: Workenesh.  Yeah, it's hard to pronounce.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Can you spell this for us?
Speaker 2: W--Well, I'm going to have to just guess what it would be spelled like in English.  W-O-R-K-E-N-E-S-H, something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So you said it's not a lot of oral history in the family, but you'd be surprised, a lot of people don't remember the oral history, or it's not passed down--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --So are there any stories that are passed down from that side of the family about life in Ethiopia?
Speaker 2: No, not that I can come up with right now, no.
Speaker 1: Were your people a part of a specific ethnic group in Ethiopia that is distinct from other groups?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, there are something like, depending how you count, something like sixty different ethnic groups in Ethiopia.  Most people who end up living in Addis Ababa, in the capital city, then end up being in the Andhra group, because it's more of a mixed group.  And so, I believe that on my mother's side, it's Andhra.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But there's always, you know, mixing that happens, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So no pure groups or as such for real, but I imagine people think there are.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: Like here.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 23556
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now did your mother [Misrak Haile] have a chance of going to school, growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, she certainly finished high school, and she finished, I think, two years of college before she got married.
Speaker 1: Did she have an aspiration, a career aspiration or something that she was--
Speaker 2: She was working as a secretary at, I believe, the US Embassy maybe, somewhere, she was working as a secretary in Ethiopia, before we came to the States.
Speaker 1: So you think it was at the US Embassy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was--yeah.  You know, I was--I was eight.  So, I don't know exactly where it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did she tell you anything about growing up?
Speaker 2: About her life?  Only that--no, no, I would say that the family, everyone was pretty private, so, a few stories about her growing up.  And, you know, it's also very--it's a very, you know--I don't want to use the word tough, but I'm trying to--I can't come up with a different word, but a culture that's very tough on kids.  So there's a--you know, stories that have to do with being spanked and, you know, the differences between being in the U.S. versus in being in a much more rigid society which is much more rigid on kids.  So, kind of comparisons between "oh, you know, if I had done that in my day, it would have been very different back in Ethiopia."
Speaker 1: But that's what we're looking for.  The sense of what it was like to grow up in Ethiopia--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --From your mother's perspective, and not--at least your impression of what it is based on what she's told you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I mean that it was, you know, and of course, compared to the U.S. and compared to our charmed lives here, just, you know, not having things in the same way that people have them here.
Speaker 1: But your mother's family was relatively well off?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, but in the poorest country on the planet, right, so the comparison is still, you know--
Speaker 1: Haiti.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Number two.  Bangladesh.  Between Haiti, Bangladesh and Ethiopia, they're vying for number one, yeah, although Ethiopia is doing better in the last few years, but still.
Speaker 1: It's a tough--from what I've read, and I read history, it's a tough land, I know that.  For anybody, it's a tough land.  Yeah, I think that from what I've read, it made it hard to colonize the Europeans, the British or the Italians or whoever, they had a tough time because it's such a tough place--
Speaker 2: Like Afghanistan.
Speaker 1: --Yeah, it's a tough place.  Rocky, and it's just a tough place to live.
Speaker 2: So yeah.  In that sense, sort of more hardship, but there's not a--my parents certainly don't discuss hardship in the sense of, you know, trying to make anyone feel sorry for their life in any way.  It's just sort of matter of fact.  These are the things that happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm just here for the stories.
Speaker 2: Just letting you know, yeah, yeah. So the things were, you know, maybe there were other kids who had a lunch that she liked better and her and her friends would come in sneak lunches from the other kids.  I mean, very small stories like that about again small amounts of hardships.  And, you know, she was a little bit--I think she was probably not the most obedient student in the class.  So she was a little bit rebellious and got in trouble, but that's the extent of what I knew about her [childhood].
Story_ID: 23557
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, Ethiopia, I don't know what religious persuasion your mother [Misrak Haile] was, but I know there are Christians there, there are Jews there, there are Muslims there, I don't know what--
Speaker 2: So it's--depending on which census one believes, it's about anywhere between say 35 and 55 percent Christian, anywhere between, in that same proportion, for Muslim, although perhaps probably a little bit lower on Muslim and then remainder is what's called animist, which is, you know--
Speaker 1: Traditional--
Speaker 2: --Traditional, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Ethiopian, are the older--
Speaker 2: Older religions before Christianity, and that's  maybe five percent of the population.  And the Christian, there are, you know, the largest group is the Christian orthodox, which has been around, which has been around since about 400 AD, and the--but there are, you know, sort of these missionary-based groups that have come in more recently Protestants and Pentecostals, which are a small percent, but growing actually, in contrast to the orthodox, which is perhaps decreasing.
Speaker 1: So how was your mother's family?
Speaker 2: Orthodox.  Orthodox Christian.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they were, would you say--
Speaker 2: Deeply Orthodox Christian.
Speaker 1: --Okay.  Would you say, they were like pretty much mainstream, I guess, for Ethiopia in those days in terms of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 23558
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.  Let me go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Getatchew Haile.  G-E-T-A-T-C-H-E-W.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Getatchew Haile?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is his date of birth?
Speaker 2: It's around 1935.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, was he born in Addis [Ethiopia], as well?
Speaker 2: Probably in the countryside.
Speaker 1: Near--
Speaker 2: Near Ababa [Ethiopia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, I think he was born in a town called T'ut'e, T-U-T-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: They were--they had financial ups and downs, I would say.  So my grandfather, whom I didn't know, on my father's side was somehow working for the local government before the Italians came around World War II [1939-1945].  So early part of World War II the Italians come--came to Ethiopia.  And so, there was a lot of disruption, and so there was a lot of hardship on my father's side as a consequence of that.  I'm not sure how my mother's [Misrak Haile] side escaped a lot of that, but maybe because they were in the city, but there was certainly a lot of hardship on my father's side because of that.
Speaker 1: So prior to the Italian invasion, I think that was--was that in '36 (1936)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So your grandfather was an official for the government?
Speaker 2: For the local government in some way.
Speaker 1: So, did he resist--the local government, I imagined, resisted invasion?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, so I think that's the source of the hardship.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And also just--everything was just disruptive.  And so my grandmother managed to make ends meet by opening a--it's called (unclear), but basically a bar for soldiers, you know.  So she was selling alcohol to the soldiers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did your grandfather participate in the bar?
Speaker 2: No.  He--I don't know what the health reason was, but he was in a wheelchair, and I think that he was in a wheelchair fairly early on, and I don't know if it was the consequence of the war or if it was just an independent medical issue.  And so, he--he was at poverty's edge, so he was living off palms--alms at the church, for example, that people would hand out.
Speaker 1: So, did they split up?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They split up, and then later in life, they got back together, but they had split up during that time.
Story_ID: 23559
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, the Italian invasion of Ethiopia [Second Italo-Ethiopian War], are there any stories that have passed down in the family about that, because this is an event that a lot of people in the United States, African Americans are unaware of now, but that rocked the country in 1936.  It was in all the black papers, there were Ethiopian support groups formed here and in the Caribbean--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --And people went over there, the journalist, J. A. Rogers, went over there--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --The real facts about Ethiopia.  A fellow called the Brown Condor, John Robinson, I think, from Buloxi, went there to form an air force for people in Ethiopia with two clients.  But it was a big--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know a lot--well, a lot of Jamaicans that were "why are we fighting for the British Queen rather than fighting for the Ethiopian Emperor" I mean, what's our loyalty to the British Queen.
Speaker 1: Right, huge emotional dealing, Marcus Garvey, Marcus Garvey's ex-wife spoken (unclear) square.  A fellow sent me a picture of her standing there, consorting the people about this.  It felt like, I think, for black people, that all of us were under attack because of the biblical references, that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: I mean, so the significance that it had on my father's side of the family is pretty clear.  I mean, again, and my grandfather was, as I said on poverty's edge, and barely survived through that.  And he had sent my father to live with one of his relatives so that he could get an education because, again, my father--my grandfather, for whatever reason, his health issue came up for him, and he was not able to take care of himself.  And living, you know, through the graces of people who were churchgoers essentially.  And so, there was a lot of--and that was--I mean, I wouldn't say there was a lot discussion of "oh, those Italians, look what they did to us", but it was again, this is the--this is the situation of what happened in a way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are stories about the political, I guess, activities in Ethiopia discussed with youth, at all.  I mean, I just wondered if there was any general (unclear) transmission of information there?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I don't--I can't say in a general sense, because I left when I was not quite ten.  So I don't know how much of it was discussed.  Certainly, when we were there, it was a time when the students both, you know, college and younger, were dissatisfied with the Emperor, so there a lot, you know, many young people talking about the political situation.  So, and the repercussions of the Italian invasion had to do with the conflict with Eritrea that Italy was responsible for that.
Speaker 1: Right.  Eritrea was a section of the country that tried to--well seceded from, and it did successfully secede from Ethiopia.  And that was--that had been an Italian--
Speaker 2: So when the Italians came in 1896, and the Ethiopian emperor at the time, you know, although managed to beat back the Italian such that they didn't take the entire country, he felt that, you know, he was looking around Africa, and seeing that every single country was colonized, that he'd better concede something to Italy, otherwise they were just going to come back, and sure enough, they came back in '34 (1934) anyway.  So, he said fine, you can have this land north of the river, which was actually the coast, and then, you know, let's have a peace treaty that way.  And in doing that he could sort of retain the rest of the country independently, and so, you know, ultimately the--so that remained an Italian colony for--up until World War II, that was an Italian colony.  And when Italy invaded in '33 (1933) (unclear) and then occupied the rest of Ethiopia through much of World War II, when Italy was on the losing side in World War II, Britain said, "okay, we're done with you, get out of here", and there was a lot of debate as to whether or not the country would be reunited.  And probably, as you've recognized as also, the boundaries in Africa, just like in Europe, they're not these official maps, that everyone says yes, this is the boundary, and even today lots of conflicts because who knows what the official boundaries are.  And so, it was not clear whether one could say that prior to the Italians this was all one country or not.  And, you know, it depends how far back in history you go, "oh, you know, the African influence was including Yemen at some point."  So, you know, so, what do you decide, so there was a lot of discussion there, and ultimately, Eritreans felt that they had had a distinct enough history that they should be independent.
Story_ID: 23560
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what did your father [Getatchew Haile] say--now, your father grew up to be a scholar--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --And a professor.  What did he say about growing up in--
Speaker 2: So his father was very educated.  And education that time was very much through the church, and so, as I said, his gran--my grandfather had sent him to go study with a relative because, you know, my grandfather felt that he couldn't provide for his son; but there were some conflicts with that relative and so my father ended up coming back to live with my grandfather, essentially, again in the church, but somehow managing to study, which is, I find, actually, really remarkable; that's how they spent their days, the two of them, you know.
Speaker 1: --So, your grandfather is actually living, you know, through the charity of the church at a certain point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, homeless.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your father actually comes back and lives with him?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I don't know exactly how they got out of that situation, but eventually, my father did, and this is the time when Haile Selassie [1930-1974] now was starting to try to find top students in the country and provide them with an education, and somehow through this process, my father was identified, and then ended up doing his bachelor's degree at the American University in Cairo [Egypt].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23561
Speaker 1: Is there--what's your impression of Haile Selassie [1930-1974]?  I know you were a little girl in Ethiopia when the government collapsed and stuff, but what's your, you know, through the stories in your family--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --I mean he's such a controversial figure--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I've read like both sides, you know, Bob Marley thinks he's a god on one hand--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --And then other people think he's just great, and other people think he was a demon, you know, on the other hand?
Speaker 2: So, you know, he was attempting to be an enlightened monarch, and unfortunately, that's essentially an oxymoron, because you cannot maintain absolute authority while also providing sort of a modern, progressive aspects of life.  So he wanted the country to be progressive and modern and developed and all that, but he wanted to maintain control over it, and it's inherently a conflict.  And also later in life, you know, he was becoming a little more senile, so his ability to keep track of a sort of polished politics of who was for him and who was against him just--he just couldn't keep track of it anymore.
Speaker 1: So mistakes are made in that kind of way, I guess.  If you have a lot of power, those mistakes can be like fatal mistakes, I guess, with people, I'm thinking.
Speaker 2: So, he also was very keen on projecting this royal image to the world.  It was very important to him; it was very useful to him, so when--when Jamaicans say that Haile Selassie has got, you know, biblical connections, he didn't deny it, he didn't affirm it, but he certainly knew the value of having this worldwide support, and so he ended up, you know, giving land to Jamaicans to say "okay, thank you for your support."  And he, you know, he certainly made use of that affectively.  He--yeah.  There' also this requirement in Ethiopian history that the emperor should come from the House of David.  So he also had to legitimize himself within the country by proving that he came from the House of David.  So having the world believe that also, helped legitimize that.  And there had been a period where they called it the reign of princes or so, where there had not, you know, it wasn't clear who was going to be the successor to the throne, so he had to sort of come in with a little bit of force.
Speaker 1: Can you kind of, just for the sake of the cultural enlightenment of our audience here--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --You know every Ethiopian restaurant bin has a (unclear)--
Speaker 2: The--
Speaker 1: --Yeah, the (unclear)--
Speaker 2: (unclear)
Speaker 1: --I guess it's like illustrated like tabloids showing Solomon and Sheba and you know--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, the Queen of Sheba.  So that's the reason why there's that expectation that there should be some connection to this biblical House of David, that Queen of Sheba, you know, gave birth to children from King Solomon and all of that line connects through and that should be the lineage of the Emperor.
Speaker 1: --And that's the central story of the Orthodox church?
Speaker 2: Well, that's the central story having to do with the monarchy.  The rest of it is the usual biblical, you know, all of the bible is the Orthodox church, although the Ethiopian Orthodox church has, I believe, one additional book that is not in the Western bible, which is--gets a lot of play here, because it's--it's a little bit like the--
Speaker 1: Like the apocryphal?
Speaker 2: --Yeah, yeah, the one that, you know, it's also really mystical and what's going to happen when the world ends, so there's another book similar to that.
Speaker 1: Like the Book of John, or something--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, the book of knowledge is very limited, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I've even read there's a story that there's a lost Ark is in Ethiopia?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  There is the faithful in the church who maintain that the Ark of the Covenant is in a church in somewhere in Northern Ethiopia, close to Axum (unclear), and that there are a couple of monks who are tasked with protecting it, and you do not question whether or not they are the covenants there, because it is a matter of fact.  If you question it, you are not faithful.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But nobody's seen it then?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay
Story_ID: 23562
Speaker 1: So, at any rate, well, back to your father [Getatchew Haile], well he went to American University in Cairo [Egypt], and--
Speaker 2: So, he did his bachelor's degree there, and he was--yeah, I don't remember--I think that he was also--he was to study probably religious studies, but he also studied linguistics, and he took additional courses at another institution in Cairo [Egypt], but I've forgotten which one it was.
Speaker 1: --Reading the outline, I got the sense that he studies ancient languages?
Speaker 2: Semitic languages, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yep, absolutely.  So--being a linguistic.  So these are languages that are somehow--somewhat connected with Arabic and Hebrew.
Speaker 1: So, then he goes on to study in Germany, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  After he finished his bachelor's degree in Cairo, he went on to do his PhD in Tubingen [Germany], which also, for whatever reason, had a very strong program in Semitic languages.
Story_ID: 23563
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, is there a story about how your parents [Misrak Haile and Getatchew Haile] met, or how they got together?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I mean, my father was professor at Addis Ababa University [Ethiopia].  They would have met--I think they would have met right after he came back from Germany.  And so he saw her as a student, and he basically, you know, just said, "that's the woman I'd like to marry", and then he made an effort to get to know her.  She has many sisters and a very protective mother, and so there are some very amusing stories about how you'd have to go, you know, and sit in the house and have conversations with, you know, my to be grandmother and lots of sisters, but she would never be around, and how he had to be very, very persistent to finally be able to talk with her.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 23564
Speaker 1: Okay. So you were going to tell us about the courtship rituals in Ethiopia, I guess, the customs, I guess.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So your father [Getatchew Haile] had to be persistent and patient--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Spent a lot of time at your mother's [Misrak Haile] house.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: She wasn't there.
Speaker 2: Right, talking a lot with the rest of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Eventually had a chance to meet her.  And my mother is extremely shy, probably why we don't know so much about her childhood.  So eventually they eloped, because she didn't want to have a big wedding.
Speaker 1: So they eloped.  Now, that seems like a--was this a drastic--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Also on my father's side, they had identified somebody else that he was supposed to marry.  So, he just didn't want to enter that discussion, so.
Speaker 1: --So this is all exceptional behavior?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, when did they get married?
Speaker 2: That would have been '63 (1963) or '64 (1964).
Speaker 1: Okay.  1964, okay.
Story_ID: 23565
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' personalities and talents, their habits, their looks and how they walk and talk, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Looks is my mother [Misrak Haile], but both my parents are stubborn, so I have that.  My father [Getatchew Haile] is very precise and detailed-oriented, and I have that characteristic.  Those are--those are the main ones from them.  My father is very persistent, as well, and I have that characteristic.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we have a situation in our house that every room has a box of tissues.(laughing)  My parents' house and my house.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  What are the predominant characteristics in your mother and father?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd say--
Speaker 1: You mentioned some of them.
Speaker 2: --My parents are pretty private, and you perhaps have noticed, already, that in this conversation, I'm very happy to tell you everything about what happened with Haile Salassie and what it means for the country, but I have a harder time answering questions on personal life, and I think that's a characteristic; it's more extreme with my mother, but also true of my father.
Story_ID: 23566
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you have siblings, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you name them and tell us where you fit in?
Speaker 2: Yes.  So, the oldest is my sister Rebecca, who's a little over a year older than me, and then many years later, is my sister Mare Ansina(sp), and then a year younger than her is my brother Johannis(sp).  And then when we were in--right after I had left the college, my parents had adopted my two cousins, so they fit in between; the older one is Elizabeth and the younger one is (unclear).
Story_ID: 23567
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember--yeah, I mean, with my father, you know, when he puts you on his shoulders, kind of thing, and walking around places, that's probably my earliest childhood memories.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you describe--now you grew up in--you started off in Ethiopia?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And you left when you were, what, how old, about ten?
Speaker 2: So we left permanently right before I turned ten.  In an earlier time we had also spent two years in the States.  So, my father [Getatchew Haile] did one year at Oklahoma University and one year at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you describe where you lived in Ethiopia?
Speaker 2: We lived in the city in Addis Ababa [Ethiopia].  We lived--most of what I remembered--I don't know where we lived, you know, when I was ages one and two, but after we came back from the States from the first trip, we lived in the University apartments, so we lived right on the University campus when my father was a professor, and then we were building a house that was close by, and we had just moved into that house before we left permanently.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were right in the heart of the city.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 23568
Speaker 1: We always ask this question.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, we were close enough that, you know, that the Emperor's [Haile Selassie] palace was close by, and the Emperor had some lions and so you could hear the lions roar.  So that was certainly part of the sound.  And it was quite interesting if you drove by the palace, you know, there go drivers (making honking sounds); it was forbidden in the vicinity of the palace, so there was not much honking when you went by there, yeah.
Speaker 1: So it's good to be the Emperor, right?  So what was the palace like?  What did it look like?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I don't have a good vision of it.  I think it was probably behind a big wall, and so I just had the wall, and again in third world living, that most people who have any, you know, any value in their home, there's lots of walls everywhere, so everything is walled.
Speaker 1: Okay.  More sights and sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: You know, it was also some not--some very unpleasant sights, because in '74 (1974) is when the famine that surely people heard about in the States, was in the news a lot; one of the first ones that got a lot of coverage in the West.  And in fact, my father had been on a team that went to the countryside and alerted the population in Addis Ababa [Ethiopia] that there was a really serious drought going on in the countryside.  People in the city didn't know that, well, and people were just kind of wondering why are people coming in from the countryside.  And so the sight for us was just huge numbers of beggars on the street, and if you were in your car, and you stopped at a stop light, it's not, you know, here in the U.S., you might have somebody with a sign saying, you know, I'm homeless, please help me out, but there, just knocking on your window, just--it was really extreme, and that was because of the drought.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because you grew up in such a unique place, I mean, I think it would be really good if you gave us--
Speaker 2: A little bit more of what it felt like there.
Speaker 1: --Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean, some of the other--I can't--aspects of sights and sounds, I mean, when we drove out to the countryside, it's this classic picture that you have, you know, you know, backdrop of lion king right, where it's this mountains and the trees that--the umbrella trees, I don't know what the official name of them is--
Speaker 1: I think acasia?
Speaker 2: --Maybe it's acasia, yeah, yeah, that are wide, and when you're driving, you know, you might see the baboons out in the distance.  You certainly would hear hyenas.  And just because of the way the rainy season is and the sun is, there are many, many days of rain during sunshine.  And the saying is that that's when the hyenas would be given birth.  So, yes, those were certainly some of the things that were quite distinct from growing up there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, Addis Ababa, that's the capital--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Biggest city in Ethiopia?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And you were living down by the University near the palace?  I guess compared to the U.S., I mean, what was it--
Speaker 2: Well, some of the other things that were different is that, you know, the U.S. is immense, and people move a lot.  And oftentimes, people don't have extended family.  It depends on which parts of the country; certainly, I think, probably in the East Coast, people have extended family close by more than they do on the West Coast.  There, extended family was everywhere; so every time we had a, you know, a holiday, say Easter, Christmas, you name it, there were 20 cousins around, twenty aunts and uncles, and we all went to my grandmother's house on my mother's side.  It was just lots of people all the time; lots and lots of people, you know, that parents would play cards late into the night and kids would be hanging out, running around.  So it was much more family-knit in that sense.  And although I didn't experience it as much, because I left at again, almost ten, it also meant that it was--there's much less anonymity as a person.  So, in the U.S., you know, if you live in New York City, chances that you're going to run into somebody that you know on the street are pretty small, so you just go about your business and for the most part, people don't know what you're doing, and you could be outrageous if you like, if that's what's fun for you, but not in a small-knit group where it's much more like being in small town in the U.S. that everybody knows what you're up to, so you have to, maybe, watch yourself in a good way and a bad way, you know, and I'm not going to pass judgment as to whether that's the way society should be, but it's much more that everybody knows what you're up to, yeah.
Story_ID: 23569
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a large part for my parents [Misrak and Getatchew Haile], but we, as kids, did not go very much, and part because the whole prop(sp) was extremely long, extremely long.  It was way too long to bring kids.  I think that's the conclusion of my parents--
Speaker 1: You said extremely long, how long?
Speaker 2: Three hours, easily, for each service.  The services were long.  So we'd go for, you know, baptisms and weddings and things like that, but not on a weekly basis.  And also, the language that was used was Ge'ez, which is, you know, equivalent to having Catholic Church in Latin, where nobody actually understands it, so you're just sitting around for three hours, so my parents spared us that.  And I don't know if that was true of all families or just us, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Would you consider your parents very, I mean, devoted church people?
Speaker 2: My father, in particular.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and he was, you know, he was headed that path, actually, to be a priest, but I'm not sure what changed his mind.
Speaker 1: So he, more than likely understood.  He understood what they were talking about, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, that, as a linguist, and that's partly why through his church education that he knew the language the Ge'ez and, you know, all those Semitic languages.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that language?
Speaker 2: It's G-E-apostrophe E-Z.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In English, I believe, it's referred to as Ethiopic.
Story_ID: 23570
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, now, school, where did you start school?  What was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: So, my preschool, I believe, was called the Jack and Jill.
Speaker 1: Now, that's kind of funny--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --That that would be--there would be a Jack and Jill preschool in Ethiopia.  Jack and Jill, okay.
Speaker 2: Yep.  And then after we came back from the States and again after that first two years, I ended up going to the British school, which was called Sanford School--Sanford English School.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you went to--the family--you started preschool in Ethiopia, I take it--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --And then the family moved to the U.S.?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, you were out in Oklahoma, you said?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What part of Oklahoma?
Speaker 2: I think Oklahoma City.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then one year in Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you start elementary school?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  I think--no, I think the first--I don't know whether UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles] was first or Oklahoma was first.  I certainly have--I can envision photographs of being either in first grade or preschool in Oklahoma, which makes me think Oklahoma was second, yeah.  So it was--it could have been preschool in the States and then--and then starting off kindergarten in Ethiopia.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, but Jack and Jill was that here or--
Speaker 2: That was in Ethiopia.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: It could have been the first year I was back, maybe that was still preschool, I don't know.
Speaker 1: --Okay, because the family went over in what year?
Speaker 2: '68 (1968).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I would have been just two, could have been '69 (1969), but I think it was '68 (1968).
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're in Oklahoma for a year then in 1969 in Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  That could be reversed.
Speaker 1: Okay, then maybe Ethiopia.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Could have been Jack and Jill was the first year back in Ethiopia.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that seems like it makes sense because you would have been four--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, four or five.
Speaker 1: --Four or five, all right.  So, did you like school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No complaints there.
Speaker 1: Now, were there public elementary schools in Ethiopia?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were.  There were public schools, but that was not considered an education at all.  So if you can afford it at all, you did not go to the public schools.
Speaker 1: What were the public schools like, just for the benefit of--
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I mean, I think that, you know, the entire resources were simply not there.  I think there were very few public schools, because most of the traditional education in Ethiopia was through the church.  So there may--it may have been such a new concept that, you know, that it just wasn't done yet.  So it was much more the non-religious schools were associated with, you know, some sort of western agency in some way.  So there was an American school that my sister went to, and I went to this British school--English school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you say like the church--when you say church education--
Speaker 2: Which is what my father [Getatchew Haile] had had.  So that was a strong education, but it was very much reading and writing.  So reading all the biblical stories, and, you know, copying that and writing and that very traditional education.  It wouldn't be, you know, science and that.  It wouldn't be you know, learning about the world in a neutral way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It kind of paints a picture--I guess there's other things I read, that in a system like that, I mean, everything is so locked into place, that there's hardly any room for any deviation, you know.  I guess a church school would probably already have the world figured out.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  And for me what's quite remarkable is that my father is quite progressive for having grown up through that education system, extremely progressive.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23571
Speaker 1: Now, you were just a little kid when he came over here, but I imagine that was really a big deal for him to come to, you know to--
Speaker 2: Coming to the United States, yes, at age nine almost ten, yes; about three weeks before I turned ten, yes, absolutely, it's quite shocking.  I mean, so we had lived in the States, so that was the--
Speaker 1: --But you were so little.
Speaker 2: --Yes.  So, so, I mean, even psychologically, there wasn't the sense of we're going to the unknown.  So, we've been there, done that.  So the fear was not high.  In fact, there was a lot of excitement, you know, so if we back up a bit, you know, starting in late '74 (1974), when the Emperor was overthrown, there was just crisis--the sense of crisis in Ethiopia was really severe, so for example, there was a curfew, right, so you could not be out after dark.  And since we're close to the equator, dark is 6:00 p.m. every single day.  And so, there was always this fear, you know, get home before--before dark, get home before the sirens, you know, there was always this sort of tension, and, you know, my relatives and my father [Getatchew Haile], in particular, were--a lot of them were involved in this political discussion, so you'd hear what was happening, and, you know, you would hear of somebody that you knew was now in jail or somebody, you know, that you had met once was now killed, so there was a lot of this sort of backdrop despite the fact that, you know, the adults were trying to protect the kids from that information, you couldn't--you could not know that this was happening.  There was a general sense of fear, and so, I don't know if you have read this in the stories, but, you know, we left under tremendous duress.  My father had been a member of parliament, and after the coupe, the military came after him basically.  And there was a lot of chaos, so it's not even clear who sent the order to arrest him.  I don't think he still understands who it was.  Because again, it wasn't clear who was in charge, and who was upset with what he was doing, and he's not exactly clear which action had offended which person that caused them to come to try to arrest him.  And when he puts it together--shall we pause?
Speaker 1: Maybe we should pause for a second.
Speaker 2: --So we left under duress, and so, my father, when he tried to piece together why someone may have sent an order to arrest him, he concluded that it must have been because he was attempting to protect the church, essentially.  And not protect the church and say yes, the church should have all, you know "xyz", so as you might imagine in a religious monarchy, a lot of the land is owned by the monarch and aristocracy and a lot of land is owned by the church, and so when you have a communist revolution, you know, it obvious that that's not really fair.  So he--my father was articulating, well let's do this in a sort of slow process, you know, not terribly slow, but in a fair process where, you know, priest are not being, you know,  executed, for example, for simply owning land.  And they don't own it themselves, they run the lands, so let's do this in an orderly way and, you know, make sure that there's--that there's not just unfair disruptions to people's lives.  And so, that's what he concluded, that it was because he had articulated that position that--that somebody sent the order to arrest him.  So when they came to arrest him, he resisted, because most people who were arrested had eventually ended up dying in jail.  So he said, "I haven't done anything wrong, I'm not going."  And that's when he got shot, but he wasn't killed, he was wounded, and so, you know, he went to the hospital, we, for several months, were staying with relatives, my sisters and I.  And then after a few weeks in the hospital, he was able to get to a hospital in Britain, and again, my sisters and I were still in Ethiopia, not knowing, you know, what would happen to the family.  But after about seven months or so then we were able to leave Ethiopia, and we all were reunited in the U.S. in 1976.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It sounds like it was really a time of confusion in terms of, as you were saying, you weren't sure who was in charge of what.  I would just imagine they have a communist revolution in Ethiopia.  You might have the arms to take over, but to turn the culture around is a  big--is a job that even, you know, you have to take more guns to do that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, everyday life probably didn't change for the people?
Speaker 2: After the revolution?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
Speaker 2: A lot of things changed.  A lot of things changed because, well, so prior to the revolution there was certainly fear of the monarch, okay.  There was fear that you would never say anything bad about him, because he might, you know, somebody--somebody who's loyal to the Emperor might be listening and then you're in jail.  That fear escalated dramatically, and so there was no--there was no speaking out against the government, unless you were in a very safe area, or you knew the risks you were taking.  A lot of things got nationalized at that point.  My uncle had a construction company that was taken over by the government, so everything was nationalized.  So the economics changed dramatically.  After we left it was what was called the period of terror, where people were just being killed and bodies left on the street; I mean, we didn't see that because we left kind of early, but it was a horrible time for the next couple of years.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that I read that Haile Salassie was taken out of the Capital in a Volkswagen, or something like that, held captive and people were not sure when he--
Speaker 2: Right, because the government did not--the new--the communist government did not want to take responsibility for killing Haile Salassie, because the people would be really upset heading for that.  I mean, the population, in general, wanted change.  They wanted the monarch to step down and release control.  They had huge respect for him, still, as a monarch.  There was no desire to kill him.  That was--it was not like the French Revolution where there was a sense of, you know, this person is, you know, playing games with the country; there was huge respect.  And so, the new government could not blatantly kill him.  So eventually, they did kill him, but in a very quiet way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's interesting.  People want respect, but they still wanted the change, and they knew it wasn't going to change unless he was removed.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And as I said it's hard--it's a complete disconnect.  How do you remain as monarch but also modernize; you can't.  Once people start getting an education, which is what he did, he introduced, you know, great education in the country.  And my father was a beneficiary of that, but, you know, my father was also out there saying, okay, we need change, you know.  You've got people dying in the countryside, and you're not letting the world know about it, because you want to maintain this image; that's not acceptable.  So, but it doesn't mean we want to kill you, right, so.
Story_ID: 23572
Speaker 1: So, let me back track a little bit.  Now, where did you go to school, prior to leaving the country?
Speaker 2: That was this English school, Sanford English School.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, what's it called?
Speaker 2: Sanford, S-A-N-F-O-R-D, English School.
Speaker 1: So, were the teachers mostly British?
Speaker 2: British and Ethiopian, both.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: The principal was British.
Speaker 1: Now, when you were in grade school, were you--
Speaker 2: I was a goody two shoes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Pretty much the description.
Speaker 1: So, you liked school and you were a good two shoes--
Speaker 2: Cried a lot if anyone touched me, really sensitive.
Speaker 1: --Did you like mathematics?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I mean, liked all my subjects.  I liked them all.  I liked them all, they were all easy for me, and the difference is between going to school in Ethiopia, and I think many third world countries, compared going to school in the U.S. is that there's respect for education, respect for kids who were smart, and so you were the popular kid, because you got all, you know, top grades; that made you the popular kid.  There was not being popular because, you know, you could put a ball into a hoop, you know, that was just, so what, or because of the clothes you wore, like "what"?  So that was a--that was a shock actually, to come to the States and learn that putting your hand up in class meant automatically, you had no friends, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, how did you dress?  I don't really pay attention to that so much, but I guess for this, how did you dress growing up in Ethiopia?
Speaker 2: It was pretty western, but it was, imagine western, but the styles, ten, twenty years out of date, that's essentially it.  So, you know, flower jeans when they were done with in the west, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, there wasn't any official gender centric dress code or anything?
Speaker 2: I think we were required to wear skirts to school; yeah, we were, and they would announce if it was too cold and rainy that week, we could wear long pants, as girls, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I guess those who were Muslim, you know, had a specific kind of style of dress?
Speaker 2: There were not--I do not recall any Muslims in our school, in terms of dress, and the Capital city [Addis Ababa, Ethiopia] does not have a very large Muslim population, at least not then, not visibly.  So, I don't remember that coming up as an issue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any favorite teachers?
Speaker 2: No, I don't like any of them.  I don't like any of them.  They were all mean. (laughing)  You know, you didn't do your work, you would put your hand out and get slapped and the teachers--teachers were individuals to be scared of.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So none of them were warm enough to--
Speaker 2: That was also a huge shock to come to the States and find out that teachers and kids could be friends, "what, you're not terrified when the teacher walks in the classroom, what's going on?"
Story_ID: 23573
Speaker 1: It just popped into my mind, during the break, the issue of servants.  I know a lot of African American tourists who go to Ethiopia on a visit, or one case of a woman who married an Ethiopian, I know, went over, was  uncomfortable with the servant situation because it's so many people that need work there that any little task, you know, is done by--
Speaker 2: Is done by someone else, yep, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --Someone else, and it makes people from here feel  uncomfortable, because, they can't, you know--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --They feel like they're surrounded, you know.
Speaker 2: So, there's a lot of aspects of that. So, connected with that is the overall notion that kids should serve parents, which was very funny when I tell my kids about that, "you'd be making me a cup of tea right now."  And so there's that, elders are extremely respected and there's, yeah, as you said, there's always people taking care of any small need.  For me, personally, you know, I left when I was young, and you know, as I said, my parents were fairly progressive, so although we had--we had two people working for us in the house, or one who sort of took care of the garden and was, you know, it's called sort of the overall guard of the house, and then one who helped with housekeeping and child care, but we were responsible for, you know, cleaning up our bedroom and making our beds and things like that, and so we were not, as kids terribly pampered growing, so we never were recipients of that.  I would say that we were providers of service in terms of, you know, okay, I see a kid, I need you to go do this, do that, you know.  Anyone of your older relatives could command you to some task, and you politely agreed.  And so what was interesting for me to return; I went back for the first time a couple of years ago, was to be on the other side then, having been this kid who was, you know, always providing service, and again, I don't--this is a cultural thing, I don't hold it against any of my relatives, that's just what you did.  To switch from that side to being the one who is the recipient of, you know, lots of people looking out for you, I had this sense of sort of incompetent royalty, was that--that was what I needed to play, and like I couldn't even hold up my own umbrella in the rain, you know.  And may you know about a year ago, there was this big deal when Obama went to China, and he held up his own umbrella, you know, and so it's like, yeah, "we're down to earth, it's okay, the U.S. is really down to earth that way," and a lot of the rest of the world, if you are special, you don't do any of that; someone else takes care of you.  And as you said, it's partly because there's no employment.  My uncle who has a construction company, does not buy a lot of machinery, because he says well why would I buy that, I need to give people employment.  It's  not that I'm doing them a disservice by asking them to do these jobs, financially it's about the same, so I might as well give  people jobs rather than importing some big tractor that's going to do the job in a day, you know.   Yeah, okay, I have to maintain it, so there's some cost there, you know, whether it's a cost savings, you know, it financially similar, but the impact on the population is much better not to actually buy that whatever machinery it is to build that road; it's just better to have the people do it.
Story_ID: 23574
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now before we get you out of Ethiopia again, let me ask this question.  It just occurred to me to ask you about energy in Ethiopia. What was the energy like, I mean electricity and gas?
Speaker 2: So we, you know, we were reasonably financially well off and, of course, in the University, there's electricity and wiring.  Even though the powering would go  out, there was--water would stop flowing; that was actually more noticeable for us than power outages in part, because the climate is so nice so you only really need power, you know, for lights in the evenings.  There's--I mean there's not air conditioning or heating needs, I mean, the climate is very comfortable.  But for cooking is the biggest issue on the countryside, and that caused a lot of deforestation, because people go and collect the wood and burn it.  So that's--it didn't impact our daily lives in the city, but that's the national crisis as a consequence of not having energy.  And, of course, you know, '76 (1976), it was the OPEC oil crisis, so, lots of lines for, you know, driving  your car, you know, fill up the car, and you could only buy on even and odd days.  I don't know if that happened in the States, but the rationing was such that if your license plate was even, you could only buy on an even day, and you know something to that effect.
Speaker 1: So, what did you cook with in the city, normally?
Speaker 2: Probably kerosene, is my guess; I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I was wondering if they used gas, or some kind of fuel kind of stove like kerosene?  All right, so, '74 (1974) is the crisis, and your father is shot and recovers, you say, in Germany, right?
Speaker 2: He went into the hospital in England.
Speaker 1: England, England, I'm sorry, England.  Then the family, you know, moves to the States.  And you all ended up in Ethiopia?  Maybe I'm going too fast, like where did you go first, did you go directly to Minnesota?
Speaker 2: Yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Small town, a town of 2000.   So why there, is the obvious question, right; why a small town in Minnesota.  So it turns out that the largest benedict in monestery in the United States is in Central Minnesota, and monks, of course, have a tradition of, you know, recording and duplicating manuscripts, and so this particular monestery was doing it in a very modern way where they would visit, you know, libraries in Europe and make microphone copies of their collections, and they would do this also in Ethiopia, but going to the various churches and making microfilm  copies of the biblical manuscripts or the church manuscripts that they had.  My father, being both a linguist and very connected with the church was a person who was, you know, helping with the guidance there and saying making introductions and bringing them to the various churches, and also being a scholar in the sense of recognizing the value of maintaining these records.  So                                                                                                          doing a lot of the coaxing of the priests to say let these people make a copy for you in case something goes wrong and you have a copy of this.  And so, there were something like 6000 manuscripts that were microfilmed and not yet catalogued, and so we came to, you know, to do that work, basically.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, your father was confined to a wheelchair during this period, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: How long did he--I mean is he--
Speaker 2: He's still in a wheel chair--
Speaker 1: --He's still, okay.
Speaker 2: --As a consequence of the gunshot wound.
Speaker 1: So he never fully recovered from that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23575
Speaker 1: All right.  So, now, where did you go to school in Minnesota?
Speaker 2: Different places, so it's a little bit ironic in hindsight, because Minnesota actually has a very good public school system, but coming from a country in which public education was just simply not something you would consider, my parents put us in a private school, so Catholic Schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, for example, fifth grade was St. Boniface School, but junior high, I did not go to private school, actually, I went to the public school, hated it, and then went to--
Speaker 1: Now, why did you hate the public school?
Speaker 2: --Well, I sort of mentioned these issues about, you know, people care about how you dress and if you raise your hand in class, you've got no friends.  It takes a while to adjust to the U.S. system.  It's a pretty rough system.  Being a girl, taking industrial arts instead of home ec, there were just a lot of things that, you know, didn't jive with the U.S. system for me, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is 19--
Speaker 2: You know, you got to know the right music, and I had no idea who the right musicians were, I had no idea what the right sports were, you know.
Speaker 1: --Okay, so were you--did people follow popular music in Ethiopia the way they do here?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, again, as I said, it's like the styles are twenty years behind, you know.  We had a few TV shows, but they were twenty years behind.  You know we were watching Hawaii 5-0, but it was after it was no longer on the air in the States.  We were listening to, you know, the group has come back like Aba, you know, but it was done in the U.S.  And it wasn't that big a deal, it was just sort of what you liked, and there was no, "you were cool or hip" because of what you liked.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It's all different orientation towards popular culture.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It just didn't permeate the essence of who a kid was by knowing or not knowing popular culture.
Speaker 1: Now how did, I mean, did this outside world invade your household or did--I know I read some place you had attended a--I don't know if this was for high school, but a boarding school--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't go to the boarding--I mean it was a school that had boarding opportunities for the boys, but it was a local school, so there were also kids who just went there during the day.
Speaker 1: Okay, so St. Boniface, for instance--
Speaker 2: No.  St. Johns.  St. Johns.
Speaker 1: That was the boarding school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was--again, it was a mixed school.  So some kids boarded and some kids came.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't board?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --No, no, no.  So it was mixed.  A number of kids boarded and a number of kids, as I said, came in on a daily basis, and that's what I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So in terms of your household, how did the whole experience of moving over here affect your household? I mean, um--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I mean, my parents were amazing, because we came with suitcases, basically, we didn't even have refugee status; who knows what could have happened to us.  My dad has basically no employment options except for this particular position, because his skills were so specialized and he's in a wheel chair, so this is it; this is the only thing he can do.  We were well below the poverty line, but as growing up as kids, we had no idea.  It was, you know, happy face by the parents; they did an amazing job.  My mother is terribly shy, so she's not about to get a job, so, you know, just what my dad did, and well, my brother and sister were too young, also for her to be out of the house and have it be financially worthwhile, you know, for her to get a job and then get a sitter, so.
Story_ID: 23576
Speaker 1: Now, was the family able to connect any other Ethiopians in--
Speaker 2: No, not in Minnesota, at the time.  We had one uncle who lived in Kansas, so we'd see him occasionally, but that was far away.  Yeah, that's remarkable that they made it through, as I said, well below the poverty line, but we never felt it.  And I think, you know, people in the U.S. are very funny about somehow poverty being associated with not being able to eat well, because in fact, if you buy groceries and cook it yourself, that's actually a very cost-effective way of eating as opposed to going to McDonald's, which seems like it's cheap, but it's actually really expensive if you, you know, compare that more honestly.  So--so certainly, there was never, never an issue for us.  I mean what did it feel like?  It felt like well, you know, if I was going to buy clothes, I had to babysit and get the money to buy clothes, but that was the only--but it didn't seem unusual to me, because I just figured that's what everybody did, but, yeah, so it was fine.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the adjustment wasn't--
Speaker 2: Well, not for that aspect of the adjustment.  The part of the adjustment that was hard was understanding American culture.  That was, quite frankly, brutal.  I was picked on on the bus, the classic kid, the classic kid that you hear about, you know, bullies, and who's the recipient of that bullying, well that was me.  So it was--it was  not--it was not a good scenario.
Speaker 1: I would just think that the bullies in Minnesota or wherever in that situation, there aren't that many black people in Minnesota anyway--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's true.
Speaker 1: --You're from Ethiopia.  Did people--did they mistake you for other--who did they think you were?
Speaker 2: Well, there was also a large just ignorance, I mean, in the sense of--so sixth grade, I'd show up for school the first day, and I had all the kids around me checking out my hair, the whole class, I mean, in the playground.  You know, and it's not being mean, so, but it was also interest--as I look back at it on hindsight, I don't think the teachers where my kids go to school would  allow that, right, because you're making someone feel awkward, even if the other kids aren't trying to do it.  So it's interesting to me how much more sophisticated the schools have gotten, and thankfully so.  So that was not--I mean it was just weird to me, it wasn't--it wasn't mean, and slightly amusing to me, actually.  So--but then--but then when it became clear that I had no idea about U.S. culture, and as I said, who I should be listening to on music and which concerts I should be interested in and which sports I should be interested in and whether Levi's Jeans are the right jeans or Lee Jeans are the right jeans when I had no idea about these things, then--then that's when things got brutal, and that was in the public school, in seventh grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So all these subjective--value judgments are just--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So--
Speaker 2: And again, teachers not stepping in.  In the hindsight if I look at, if there were teachers that allowed the kinds of things that happened to me to happen to my children, I would be absolutely furious.
Speaker 1: --Okay.  Okay.  So how did you react to that?
Speaker 2: Kind of whatever.
Speaker 1: I kind of get the sense that you didn't try to adjust yourself to fit the--
Speaker 2: I don't think that I would have even known how.  I still--I really did not understand it.  And it's only in hindsight that I can say that, "oh, that's why".  You know, I had--I really didn't--I had no idea.
Story_ID: 23577
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, now, were there any special teachers in--I guess you're in like in the fifth grade, I guess.
Speaker 2: I started out in sixth grade.  So six was okay, that's when I went to a small private school in a small town; seventh and eighth were in a large public school, junior high, which is also when kids are always mean to each other anyway.  So, I have no positive experiences from those two years.  And then junior--high school was when I switched to this other school that you had read about--
Speaker 1: St. Johns?
Speaker 2: St. Johns, which was a smaller school, and was--there were good teachers and bad teachers there, yeah.  And, as you might imagine, the math and science teachers were the ones that, I would say, looked out for me in a way so.  And then everything was much better there, because it was smaller group.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: And also by now, I'm starting to learn that I'm supposed to wear Levi's Jeans and not Lee Jeans (laughing), and that I shouldn't raise my hand in class.  "Oh, that's why," "Oh, that's why you put the kick me sign on me, because I raised my hand in class."  Now I get it.
Speaker 1: It's really crazy.  All that stuff is really crazy, but you have to learn it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, was there any aspect of the popular culture that you really liked in the United States?
Speaker 2: A popular culture.  I mean, what I--one thing which I mentioned earlier was this notion of anonymity that it--I think it allows you some freedom in a way.  Despite--despite the fact that it's this irony that in the younger schools that the kids think that they are individuals, but in fact they're really not.  I mean they're--like I said, you know, what they wear, who they talk about, is really set by mass marketing.  It's phenomenal to me.  It's phenomenal to me how kids really think they are their own individual, but really what they're doing is sort of, you know, fighting their parents and marching to the tune of, you know, of marketers.  But that said, if you were able to sort of free yourself from marketing, you know, propaganda, you do have an ability to be much more individualistic, not individ--but be much more of an individual in the U.S. than in many cultures.  So once--you know, once all that dust settles, you can.  And I think some of the things that I did in high school, which I enjoyed a lot would have been very had for me to in Ethiopia, which is much more of a actual strict control of who you are and, you know, what you do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you have friends early on, or was it hard to make friends?
Speaker 2: In the States?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: It was hard.  So sixth grade, as I said, was okay; seventh and eight grade were brutal, and I had maybe  one or two friends, you know, they were equally the outcast, you know, so there was maybe two or three outcasts that hung out together.  And then by ninth grade, it was, you know, again, the high school was fine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was also just changing setting, as I said, having learned, you know, and the other aspect is that, you know, in a school setting, once you are identified as one way, there's just no way that that's going to change, you know, you are that kid, and so--
Speaker 1: Now, your sister is a year older than you, so you all are basically in school at the same time?
Speaker 2: --Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, was that good to have your sister with you?
Speaker 2: Well, so she had gone to an American school in Ethiopia, so she actually adjusted to the U.S. much better; much more quickly than I did.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: So she didn't have the same kind of trouble, and so she hung out with her friends and she was fine.
Speaker 1: --Okay--
Speaker 2: And we only overlapped in school one year, in that whole period, so.
Speaker 1: --All right.  Now, in terms of your studies, I imagine that American History and some of the literature and some of the rest of it seemed really subjective, I guess, coming from another country?
Speaker 2: Well, here's the funny thing.  This story I love to tell.  Here we come from Ethiopia, where, you know, "third world country, must be backwards." (whispering)  So, we show up in sixth grade, and the school assumes that we need to be in, you know, I'm in sixth grade, my sister is in seventh grade that we need to be in some sort of  remedial courses, right, because we're from the third world country.  Well, actually, I speak the Queens English, and you are speaking it incorrectly.  So they quickly had to realize, "no, no, no, no, we got to put them in the most advanced classes."  So that was kind of amusing, when we first came.  But, yeah so, yeah, I mean, I didn't get a lot of U.S. history, so every once and a while, when I help my kids with their homework, like, I have to read that.   You know, Thanksgiving was just like "Who is Squanto?".  You know that people are here all know.   But it's okay. Yeah.
Story_ID: 23578
Speaker 1: All right.  I imagine science and math was--
Speaker 2: It was more advanced than--in Ethiopia, it was more advanced than what we were doing here--
Speaker 1: --Really, okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: --In terms of science and math.
Speaker 1: So, I guess you excelled, I would think, you would excell.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so then.  I mean, of course, you know, so I had come in sixth grade, and what they're doing in sixth grade, I had done in fourth grade, but, you know, but at that stage by the time you get to, you know, ninth grade, everything is sort of, you know, that advantage is no longer there because I only was there in Ethiopia until fifth grade, so by the time I'm in ninth grade in the U.S. now that's clearly moved ahead, you know what I mean, so.  So that--that content advantage was no longer there; it's just simply the basis of, we just had way more homework every night than what people were getting here.  And so that ability to just say okay, I'm going to get it all done.  You know, I was shocked when we'd get assignments that would not be due for a week, I'm like, but we had three subjects every night that were due the next day, and so that--that was also surprising to me, how little homework people got.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you read ahead?
Speaker 2: By the time I was in high school?  Well, so then I just did every thousand and one activities that you could imagine.  Actually, as I look back on it, I have no idea where I got that energy.  I mean, I did every club, you know, there were--there were some, you know, unusual activities that our school offered, so we were about an hour and a half from Minneapolis [Minnesota], but you can do these classes through University of Minnesota, like there's a film making class that I took, so somehow I'm taking the bus, you know, at five in the morning, going down and doing this film making and coming back, you know.  I don't know how I managed it all.  The school paper, the--the, you know, all sorts of stuff.  The writers' club, doing theater and the city, in St. Cloud, the big city close by, so I just did all this stuff, and you know it was fun.
Story_ID: 23579
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.  Now, when did you get the sense that you wanted to be a scientist, or did you get the sense at that time?
Speaker 2: Pretty early on.  I mean there were in these science magazines oriented for high school kids; I used to get a subscription to that, you know, my friends would be getting teen magazines.  Yeah, so I really just--I really did like it.  I was-- And I was also a very good writer.  As I said I was in this writing club, and you know doing a literary magazine and doing film making, and so some of my teachers were actually surprised when I decided to go to MIT, because I thought I would go to like a, you know, more liberal arts school.  But for myself, I knew it.
Speaker 1: Several of the people we've interviewed in science that are also good writers have remarked about how different that it is from a lot of people that are good and science in the U.S., they seem to be--they wall themselves off from, you know, literature and writing and then if they have an idea, they can't express it--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --In a way that they want to, because they don't have the writing skills.  I mean, it seems to be that split, that dichotomy.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, it's interesting, actually to--I was discussing this with my son, who would like to be a scientist, but doesn't want to have--spend time on these other actions--these other subjects.   In fact to be a good scientist, you have to be good at all subjects, because you do have to express yourself.  You obviously have to do the math that's going to give you the scientific answer.  So you have to be good in all subjects.  You could be a perfectly fine writer without knowing anything about science.  In fact, you could, you know, have your scientific content to be completely wrong in your story, and nobody--that's just writing, it doesn't mean anything, it's fine.  On the other hand, it you misspelled the word that you're using as a scientist, no one would say, "ah, we know what he meant, it's okay".  No, that's part of being wrong as a scientist is that you misspelled it, but being a writer having a scientific content being accurate is not essential.  So, it's the toughest subject in that regards, because you do have to be good in all--everything peripheral.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, at St. Johns, did they offer calculus?
Speaker 2: So, they were on this campus, which had St. Johns University and also had the Abbey, St. Johns Abbey, which is this monestery, which has the largest benedictum monestery.  So this is all in one little setting, and so if you were done with what the high school had to offer, you could take classes at the University.  And so I ended up taking calculus there, at the university campus, because it's all right there, it's just, you know, 200 yards away to walk over.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is still in Minnesota?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I was going to say that there's a St. Johns in--
Speaker 2: In New York State.
Speaker 1: --New York, yeah.  So you're near St. Cloud, Minnesota?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23580
Speaker 1: The weather had to be really be--
Speaker 2: You know what's funny about that, is that we arrived in the summer, and the summer was brutal.  I mean, you know, Highlands, if you felt it, it's like being in San Francisco.  And so to come to a place which has as its state bird the mosquito, has incredible humidity, it was--that was actually much harder.  People don't think that, when they think, you came from Ethiopia to Minnesota, the cold might--no, the hot is really a problem too--is really a problem.  But, you know, you managed.  You managed.  My sister likes to recount the story that on the cold side about how the first time she had earned enough money to actually buy a warm coat, and then go through a winter where she wasn't--just had the chills all the time.
Story_ID: 23581
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, high school that year you were involved a lot of activities.  What about your social life in high school?
Speaker 2: It was fine.  It was fine.  I had some good friends, and the school was really small; it was fifty to sixty students in the class--in that grade, so everybody pretty much knew each other, and everyone was pretty much nice to each other, you know, for the most part.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, were there any special teachers in high school that drew you to a particular aspect of science.
Speaker 2: I had both the physics and chemistry teachers, especially the physics teacher who was really very good.  Yeah, so they were quite good.  I mean, again, I was already interested in that subject, but it was helpful that they were very good, especially the physics teacher.  The math teacher, he was--he was good, but he was--he clearly played favorites, and I was his favorite, so that was fun for me, but it was not so good as, you know, an educational tool.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you graduated in 1982.
Speaker 2: '83 (1983).
Speaker 1: 1983.  Okay.
Story_ID: 23582
Speaker 1: Okay, so, you graduated from St. Johns in 1983?  And when you graduated, did you--now had you chosen the school where you were going to go to college?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I had applied early action--early admission to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that wasn't really hard to figure out, I guess.
Speaker 2: No.  I--there were a couple of places I contemplated close by here, Harvey Mudd [Harvey Mudd College] was one I had contemplated and I had contemplated Stamford, so, but I didn't get admitted to Stamford, so that made it easy.
Speaker 1: Now did you have any special--you didn't get admitted to Stamford?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did you graduate with any special honors?
Speaker 2: So, well, our class was small, but I was not valedictorian, so.  I was, as I said, doing ten thousand different things, and I think MIT maybe appreciated that more than Stamford did, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  All right, MIT 1986, I mean '83 (1983), the fall of '83 (1983).  What was your major at MIT.
Speaker 2: Material science and engineering.  So when I went there, I was contemplating architecture, civil engineering and aeronautical engineering.  Aeronautical, because I had this fantasy that I would like to be an astronaut one day.  I went to my first seminar course on the topic and realized it was all air force people and decided, okay, this is not for me.  Then architecture and civil engineering, I thought, well, these would be good professions if I want to go back to Ethiopia; that would be, you know, sort of country-building activities.  But then, as I went on, I realized the chances I would do that were just, you know, that I would make my life returning to Ethiopia were pretty small, so.
Speaker 1: Is that a dream of yours, growing up, going back?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I wouldn't say that I--I guess I didn't--I didn't make a decision, so I was gonna give myself that opportunity and be valuable there by having a degree that was going to be useful.  But then as I realized the chances of that happening are small.  So it wasn't that I specifically had the dream that I would do it, it was this--in case I do it, I want to be prepared and then since that likely was going down--
Speaker 1: It's something in the back of your mind?
Speaker 2: --Right.
Speaker 1: Now, did your parents really think that one day they would go back?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Unless there was an incredible change in the government, there was no way they were going to go back.
Story_ID: 23583
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you started off with other ideas, but gravitated toward material science and engineering.  What happened, what was it about material science that drew you in?
Speaker 2: Well, it was the feeling that well, so here we are where we're in a room of stuff.  I'm sitting on a chair, I've got a microfilm made out of stuff, that the world is made out of stuff, and so if you're going to be an engineer of any sort then you have to figure out what you're going to make that object out of, whether it's a computer chip, or a bridge, or, you know, a photovoltaic,(sp) solar cell that it's going to have to be made out materials.  So, this was going to be a subject area that was going to have relevance to all aspects of life, and so that's how I picked it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's an interesting way that you explained it, because it's really true, you know, lots of stuff around us, and most people have no idea what goes into this stuff--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Or what some of this stuff is even.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, I didn't.  I know I asked in junior high school, what is plastic?  And nobody seemed to know.  None of the adults knew knew what it was--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --It doesn't grow anywhere; where was it growing?  I mean, people were just stumped.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Seem like a popular, I mean, you know it well--a lot of materials are well known for what they are, but they're not known.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, material science.  Tell us about some of the aspects of what a material scientist does?
Speaker 2: Well, so, again going back to this notion that material science connects to everything, because everything is made out of the material, so you can go after almost any problem that you'd like.  So there are problems having to do with, you know, sort of the fundamentals of how the material behave, so it could be things like strength, conductivity; if you want to make, what's called the superconductor, you know, something that has no resistance whatsoever.  You want to worry about magnetism, you know, you want to make a super strong magnet.  If you want to worry, as I said, about solar cells, so you want a material that absorbs light and creates electricity.  So any of these properties you can evaluate that in a material, and then you can also go and say, well, I want to design a material that has better properties, so how do I do it, and, you know, all this information base that I have, you know, developed, that I need to put this element with that element, and then I need to mix them with up in this way and build the structure in this way and all of that is how do I get some better properties out of my materials, so then ultimately, I can make better devices, you know.  And if I care about consumer electronics, I can make a better gadget; if I care about the energy problem then I can make a better combustion engine, because I have better materials for my combustion engine.
Story_ID: 23584
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, were there any particular instructors or professors there that really were inspirational or helpful to your development as a material scientist?
Speaker 2: So, MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] is very clever in recruiting students to material science, because in high school no one has ever heard of the field.  So the material science department there has maneuvered such that for the chemistry requirement, students can take the materials chemistry offered by the material science in engineering department.  They can also take chemistry from the chemistry department or sort of a biochemistry from the biology department.  And they put their most charismatic instructor to teach this materials chemistry course and end up recruiting a number of students into that department by this process.  And so it was a very, I guess, a very dynamic instructor and encouraged students to do research in the topic, you know, as undergraduate research assistants, you know, working with some graduate student, and I ended up doing that.  And that's when I switched my major from civil engineering to material science.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was more the research experience combined with this dynamic instructor.  I mean, I didn't speak with him directly very much, but it was his overall dynamism and encouragement to the class, as a whole, to pursue research in that area.
Speaker 1: Now, who was the instructor?
Speaker 2: It was Gus Witt.
Speaker 1: Gus Witt, okay.
Speaker 2: He also had a delightful accent to some.
Speaker 1: What was his accent?
Speaker 2: Holland.
Speaker 1: Okay, Dutch?
Speaker 2: Dutch accent, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23585
Speaker 1: Alright. Okay.  So, did you get involved in a lot of activities on campus at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was involved in political activism.  So, yes.  Well, many of my friends got arrested; I didn't go quite that far.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the object of your political activism?
Speaker 2: So, one of the things was at the time apartheid, and lots of students were trying to get their universities to divest, so that was one aspect.  MIT owned some property in Central Square, and there was some shenanigans about how to sort of expand MIT's ownership and force some residence to move out and take over the area.  Now, looking at it now, there actually--a of positive development in that area has taken place, but of course, lots of cities have also had lots of down time developments and so on.  But the students--there were people quite upset at the time.  There were, you know--for residents there who were being--having to end their leases in ways that didn't seem right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But mostly, it was apartheid, at the time.
Speaker 1: Did you have an organization on campus?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I'd forgotten the name of it, and I wasn't in the leadership, I was a participant, so I'd forgotten the name of it.
Speaker 1: I know a lots of free South African Movement was pretty much all over the place in those days.  I wasn't associated with the Free South African Movement?
Speaker 2: Probably.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: There was a time when Harvard--also Harvard University was having--it was actually when, when, who's the well known African American professor there.  He's left and gone to Chicago, I think, but anyway.
Speaker 1: Are you talking about Cornel West?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Cornel West, and there was also someone else--
Speaker 1: He's not in Chicago, but that probably--Henry Louis Gates was in charge of the department, but--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  And so there was a lot of concern that they hadn't hired an African American women in the law school, and Jessie Jackson came, and so a lot of my friends and I were there to--
Speaker 1: --That sounds like Derrick Bell.
Speaker 2: --Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was Derrick Bell involved?
Speaker 2: Derrick Bell, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, so those sorts of things.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Derrick Bell resigned from Harvard because of the--they hadn't hired a woman.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right, yep.
Speaker 1: So, you were involved in a lot of political activities, there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I also had a professor at the time, who's no longer at MIT, she was extremely outspoken and politically active.  And there were some discussions as to whether or not that's why she didn't get tenure in the end.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Kalonji, Gretchen Kalonji.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, there's a--I think it's at MIT, yeah, they have like a black student union for the--
Speaker 2: They do.
Speaker 1: --For the--well it's a science related place.  But it's a--it a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't--I mean, I have to say, I didn't know very many of the black students; I only knew people who were active, and so that's not automatically connected.  And since I had been, you know, sixth grade through twelfth grade, not knowing a single African American, and actually prior to that, really not knowing African Americans, I knew Ethiopians, so, it was not an automatic community for me when I came to MIT.  You know, culturally, there was not much connection, because, I had, you know, what my lifestyle was--my life had been.

Speaker 1: What was your reaction, I mean, how did you view African American in those days, I mean, coming here from Ethiopia?  I know on this side of the fence, there's a whole lot of confusion as to how to relate to Africans.  Some people really embrace anybody from Africa; some people reject them outright, and you have like a mix of things.
Speaker 2: So there--I would say there's also that similar, well, you know, what do we actually have in common.  And so for me, initially, I concluded, we didn't have anything in common, right, I mean, I was growing up in white America, you know, Central Minnesota; that was my initial conclusion.  After, saying, maturing a bit, and realizing that, well, you know what, majority America abuses is actually being fully identical, so in the eyes of majority America, we have the same experience, so, that, by definition, gives us something in common.  So that's--that's the later view that I took of it.
Speaker 1: Or, I guess, you could simply say you're not white, so that's the difference.  Anybody that's not white, kind of, is--
Speaker 2: The majority of the population is not gonna think that I have an experience that's any different from yours, right.  They're not gonna--"you're from Ethiopia, so that makes you different."  They're not going to think that.  It's all the same, right, so, so, being an African immigrant, you shouldn't think that it means anything.  That was my later-in-life conclusion.

Speaker 1: As you earned your bachelor's degree at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], the government in Ethiopia flipped again?
Speaker 2: Not during that period.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, no.  It was Haile--Mengisto--Mengisto Haile Miriam until around '91 (1991) or '92 (1992).
Speaker 1: Okay.  I got the wrong information.  Yeah, I thought that he was--okay, all right, so he lasted until '91 (1991) or '92 (1992)?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, you went from MIT to the University of California in Berkeley?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: You're gonna want to know that I finished MIT in three years.  You're probably gonna want to know that.  (laughing)
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  So does this mean that you were working really hard, or it was really easy?
Speaker 2: Well, I did have a lot of credits from high school, because I'd taken a lot of math, but a lot of MIT students actually have that, as well.  So, but I just--I was just used to always doing a lot, and before I realized it, I thought, I can actually graduate in three years.  So, let me go ahead and do it, because who wants to have all those loans, you know, one year less of loans was certainly an incentive.
Speaker 1: Let me ask this question.  MIT is stockpiles of impressive individuals, you know, on the faculty and students--a lot of the stories.  So who was in school with you when you were there?  Were you impressed by any of the other students?
Speaker 2: Gosh!  Yeah. Yeah.  There's not going to be anybody that I can point out and say, hey, so and so is doing fantastically well now.  You know a lot of my--well, again, and I have to confess certainly, I didn't know the black student population very well during that time period, so I don't know where, you know, who those students were and what they're doing now.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were there any African American faculty members, or any Africans there?
Speaker 2: No. What was his name; he was an urban architecture professor that I had.  I thought he was--it sounds too much of a Hollywood name, but I wanted to say Mel Gibson.(laughing) But he was--he was--yeah, so he--I think I took his class when I was a graduate student, but anyway, maybe as an undergraduate, he was somehow connected also with the City of Boston.  So maybe he had been a city representative for some period.  So I enjoyed taking a class with him, just sort of urban architecture and development things.  So my--my--my concentration--so my major was material science and engineering.  My concentration was urban architecture and development, that involved both development in the, you know, in the developed world about how do you do modern cities, but also, how do you think about development in the developing world, how do you do cities there.  So, I had him, whose name escapes me as a course for that urban architecture, where we walked around the south end of Boston--Back Bay area of Boston where gentrification was kind of happening at the time, and what did it mean.
Story_ID: 23588
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, did you graduate with any honors from MIT.
Speaker 2: I don't believe that MIT graduates with honors.  I don't think they assign cum laude and laude.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Generally honor to be there.  You know, it's not likely that someone--you know, if you're likely to meet a genius, it's probably at MIT.  So--
Speaker 2: So, you can't say that on the Cal Tech campus, but, anyway.  (laughing)
Speaker 1: --Right, right.  I guess I'm in trouble.  I better watch out.  So, now, you went to UCLA for graduate school?
Speaker 2: Berkeley.
Speaker 1: Berkeley, okay.
Speaker 2: For one year.
Speaker 1: Berkeley, okay, one year.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, did you get your master's degree in one year?
Speaker 2: Well, so I went there planning to do my PhD, and I was attracted by its liberal history, but I didn't like the department, so I went back to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So then, did you earn your master's degree from MIT?
Speaker 2: No, I did earn it from Berkeley, but I didn't finish writing it up until I went back to MIT.  So I took all the course work, and the research parts were done, I just had to finish writing it up, so I did that.  After I was back at MIT, I finish writing up the document for my thesis and submitted it at Berkeley, so that was in '88 (1988).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Most people we interview, when they're really deep into science, they don't even pause, they go right through to the PhD.
Speaker 2: Right.  And that had been my intent.  It certainly had been my intent.  It just as I said, I didn't like the department.
Story_ID: 23589
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you work for Bell Labs there after?
Speaker 2: I worked for Bell Labs in the summers as an undergraduate.  So they had this internship program where they would find sort of the top students in various departments, so they came and interviewed me, because whatever I had that one of the top GPA's and so then I went to work for them in the summer.  Then, at that time, Bell Labs had a large number of very generous fellowships that they offered to women and African Americans in science--in science and engineer.  So I applied for that and received one of those fellowships.  And part of the stipulation for that fellowship was that the summer before graduate school, you should work there.  So, I had worked there plenty of summers, but I went there again that summer now under this fellowship program, as opposed to the sort of this cooperative intern program which I had done before.  Then, when I was doing my PhD at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], there was a scientist at Bell Labs, Bob Lodes(sp), who had an adjunct appointment at MIT, and who somewhat took me under his wing and gave me access to a number of facilities at Bell Labs that were relevant for my PhD work.  And it was also very attractive for him, because he had this laboratory that was not being used much anymore, so it was nice for him to have somebody that was sort of an apprentice using that lab.  And it was historically a very significant lab; it's a place where Bell Labs developed the growth of quartz for radars.  And so, before this time quartz was all imported from South America, then in World War II, you know, when the Germans had control of waterways, it was hard to bring this quartz  in from South America into the U.S. to make radars, you know, for ships and so on.  And so, Bell Labs developed a technique to synthesize quartz rather than mine it.  And so he had these great lab facilities.  It was remarkable, and the historical significance was really remarkable, but, basically, it wasn't being used very much anymore, so--so he just, you know, he had this technician trainee and how to use all that.  So I would go back and forth between at being at Bell Labs and being at MIT for my PhD.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there where you developed the paper "Acqueous Precipitation of Spherical Zinc Oxide Powders"?
Speaker 2: You looked at my papers.  That was my undergraduate research, actually.  My undergraduate research.  And what I find interesting and amusing about that paper is that every once and a while, I check and I still get citations today.  People are still reading them; it's kind of fun.  So that was undergraduate research, which was started--I'd say the idea came out of MIT.  So this was when Gus Witt encouraged me to find a research project at MIT.  I joined a group that was doing Precipitations of Spherical Zinc Oxide Powders, and then I finished up some of those experiments when I was at Bell Labs, as an undergraduate, through that coop program.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is as a summer intern.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So I was doing research doing the academic year at MIT and then finished some of that up at Bell Labs [Bell Laboratories].
Story_ID: 23590
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you were finishing up your PhD, you got a Fulbright Fellowship, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, tell us about that?
Speaker 2: So, just to back up a bit, when I was finishing my PhD, I was actually trying to decide between something that was a little more government oriented versus hardcore science.  So, I had taken courses, for example, at the Kennedy School of Government, when I was a graduate student at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], because there's a reciprocal program with Harvard [Harvard University].  And so, you know, as I said, I was still very much interested in sort of, you know, what you can do in a social sense in proving just, you know, through political actions, how you can make the world a better place.  So, I had applied also for a AAAS Fellowship, where you end up sort of being a science advisor to the congressional aides and so on.  And so I was trying to decide between the Fulbright, which would be, you know, directly mainstream science versus something that was closer to a political career.  But I chose the Fulbright; decided I was much--ultimately, more interested in the scientific path.  So, at that stage--so I decided to go to Germany, because science is strong in Germany, you know.  I didn't consider Japan, which also has strong science; it just didn't occur to me.  I didn't want to go to England, because I did want to learn, you know, another language.  And England has strong science; that would have been the other choice.  I had taken German, when I was in Ethiopia, I had taken French, but they didn't offer French in Minnesota, so my only choice was to take German or Spanish, but I took German.  And so, I thought, well, you know, learning another language is good.  Doing another cul--you know, experiencing another culture is good.  So I went off to Germany.
Story_ID: 23591
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So you were in Germany.  What did you work on in Germany?  You were at the Max Planck Institute for--
Speaker 2: Solid State Research, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Solid State Research?
Speaker 2: So, I was doing things that were somewhat similar to my PhD, sort of studying new materials and their properties, and properties--the particular property of interest is electroconductivity, but as carried by ions rather than electrons, and that means that these materials end up being useful for things like batteries.  I wasn't exactly doing battery research at the time, but that's--that's the application relevance.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was it like being in Germany, after being here in the United States?
Speaker 2: Hard.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Germany is--what I found very interesting about Germany, and you know, maybe it's not all bad is that--and maybe it's only where I was around the (unclear) area.  Germans have no qualms about staring.  And if they find you to look unusual, in any way, shape or form--so, imagine I'm having a conversation with someone over there, but you look interesting to me, I'll say, "hey John" and have the conversation, but be staring.  And they would do that to, me a lot.  I'd say, "wow, this is incredible," but they weren't, you know, mean, it was just this constant feeling like you must be, out of this world alien, because you're being stared at all the time.  So that was a little hard.  And then being close to the NATO Headquarters which (unclear).  So very close to where the Max Planck Institute was, most people assumed that I was, somehow, connected with the military.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, if I was off--if I was off the--in the city, most people thought I was connected.  And having short hair too, most Germans thought I was a guy, so.
Speaker 1: I can't imagine that.
Speaker 2: So, you know.  It was just--it was--so I had a friend, not a close friend, but she was on the Fulbright program, as well, and she was Jewish American, and she did not last the year, you know, "I'm not staying here."  Well, what was interesting--and then I stayed another year as a Humboldt Fellow.  So the research environment in Max Planck, I mean, it's really fantastic facilities and, you know, great people in terms of their research talent and all of that intellectual caliber.  When I was leaving Germany, the Humboldt Foundation asked me to fill out an evaluation of what my experience was.  I mean, what they're trying to do is promote culture exchange and understanding between cultures and so on.  So I decided I'd be honest on this form.  So it wasn't really a fun time culturally.  What I found really impressive about the Humboldt Foundation is that they wrote me a very long letter saying we are sorry this happened.  I was really touched by that, I figured I was just filling out some form and, you know, it's just going to get filed and, you know, no one is going to read this, so I was kind of half entertaining myself.  So I was quite touched by that, that they took the effort.
Speaker 1: Now, when a student goes to Germany on a Fulbright or Humboldt Foundation, are you provided with some sort of a guide, or someone who, you know, touch base with, or do you have to just make that happen on your on?
Speaker 2: So, the Fulbright has a sort of a initial orientation program.  And so, for those of us, in particular, whose German was not very strong, they have like a three-week class period as well.  So this was up in Kiel, in the northern part of Germany, where they, you know, again had us have German classes and try, you know, get some cultural acclimation.  And they tell you some things, that you know, things that culturally you might find surprising that, don't feel offended if no one every invites you over to their home in Germany, because they're very--you know, they're very closed; they don't invite people to their homes; don't take it personally, that's just not what they do.  If you're gonna, you know, have dinner with someone, most likely, you will always be going out to a restaurant; they just don't do that.  So, that kind of thing; there was that information.  So, but beyond that; after that, we were sort of okay.  Now we've acclimated and that's it.
Story_ID: 23592
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, you earned your PhD in 1992?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: From MIT.  Now, who was your PhD advisor, and what was your dissertation?
Speaker 2: My PhD advisor was Heir Professor Doctor Bernhardt Wuensch.  I used to joke about that because that's the German title and he had spent some time in Germany.
Speaker 1: That's W-U-N--
Speaker 2: W-U-E-N-S-C-H, Wuensch.
Speaker 1: Wuensch, okay.
Speaker 2: Which means wish, actually.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my dissertation title was something like structure and conductivity of some alkaline metal silicase, some obscure thing.
Speaker 1: What were you actually doing, structure and conductivity of--
Speaker 2: Of some alkaline metal silicase.
Speaker 1: Some Alkaline Metal Silicase, okay.  Okay, now, for--
Speaker 2: Something to that effect, I mean it may not be exactly that.
Speaker 1: --Okay.  Can you break down what your idea was?
Speaker 2: So, so--so what I was doing was basically trying to make new forms of matter--not, not, I mean, new solids, basically, I mean, new compounds.  But their crystalline compounds, so a lot like quartz, if you imagine quartz; this is the lab that I was using; was a place that synthesized quartz.  So synthesize things that were like quartz but had this aspect of allowing the ions to move quickly through the structure.  So that was the objective.  So there was a lot of synthesis of these new types of crystals.  If you looked at them, they kind of looked like gems and then--so physically they looked like gems.  And then doing analysis to say, "okay, where did the atoms sit in the structure, and how does that impact how the ions can move through the structure, and how do we manipulate the structure to get the ions to move through quickly."  Because that what you need to--ultimately for these applications such as batteries.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what would be the implications of creating quartz with the ionic--
Speaker 2: Again, implications would be that you could make things like battery that are more effective in higher energy density and also to things like this.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that ionic movement would enable you to store energy in the material?
Speaker 2: Right. Very loosely connected.  Now, quick frankly in hindsight, it was esoteric materials chemistry.  And I'm not sure that I would pick it today.  In fact, I'm quite sure I wouldn't pick it today as a PhD topic.  So, it was quite esoteric materials chemistry.  What it was, was a training ground for how to--how to--how to characterize materials.  So the topic, itself, was not the critical thing, it was training and the different tools; how to do synthesis and things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you convinced your committee you knew how to do it--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --And graduated with your PhD in 1992?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Story_ID: 23593
Speaker 1: Now what did you do immediately after--Now you--
Speaker 2: So there was a little bit of this funny overlap, because the last year of my PhD, I was in Germany as a Fulbright Scholar, and I stayed another year, in Germany, as a Humboldt Scholar.  So I stayed at the same institution at the Max Planck Institute.  So I was physically at the Max Planck Institute for two years, but the first year I was there was the last year of my PhD as a Fulbright Fellow.  The second year I was there, I was there as a post-doctural scholar as a Humboldt Fellow.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That solves the mystery that was in my mind sort of in the back about how you were in both--
Speaker 2: What is all this timing?
Speaker 1: --Humboldt and, you know, Fulbright.  I said, well, maybe there is a joint there.  They're two different works.  All right.  Okay, so you finished out the year as a Humboldt Scholar.  So you come back to the States in '93 (1993)?
Speaker 2: Correct.  Fall of '93 (1993).  So in the spring, I had been interviewing for various faculty positions and also considered Bell Labs at that time, but that was just before they took a down turn; and it was becoming evident that they would not last as a research lab.  So--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the condition of Bell, I mean the standards at Bell Labs today is what, I mean--
Speaker 2: Nonexistent.
Speaker 1: --I didn't think it did.  I thought somebody told me that, and I had a discussion on the phone with someone last week who said, "oh, yes, it's still"--
Speaker 2: It's a show of it's former self; let's put it that way.  And Bell Labs was actually instrumental for, well, as I said supporting a lot of African American scientists.  At some point, I think they--they supported well over half of the PhDs, African American PhDs in science engineering math fields.  I mean, it's remarkable.  In a sense, it means you don't actually need that much money to fund all of them, because they're so few, but it's also--then they--they really promoted or encouraged people to either go into academia or come work at the Lab, so there was a large cohort there of African American scientists.  So, as I told you that sort of in my life, in my development of understanding of where I would fit in, in American society, and the realization that well, you know, there's no distinction between being and African immigrant and being African American, then I knew many more.  And also just being part of that fellowship group because I had activities for us together, and so on.  At that stage, I knew many African American Scientists and, again, many who went through the Labs.  So there's Bill Massey has actually put together what he calls this legacy of Bell Labs and the impact in the African American Community as scientists, yeah.  A lot are connected.  So, anyway, I didn't end up taking the position there because it was--it was starting to turn over in terms of its life.  So then I ended up going to the University of Washington as a faculty member there.  I mentioned to you I had this, I wouldn't say mentor, but a woman I knew who was on the faculty at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] who did not make tenure there.  She had moved to University of Washington; she was quite instrumental in recruiting me to join the faculty there--
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: --That was Grechen Kalonji.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I was there for a few years before moving to Cal Tech.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was the University of Washington like?
Speaker 2: It was fine.  It's a fine school.  It wasn't--it wasn't top tier, and what I--and that became a little more evident to me after I was there, and I decided that just wasn't the environment I wanted to stay in.
Story_ID: 23594
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were there until--
Speaker 2: Well, my employment there was through the spring of '96 (1996); so fall of '96 (1996), I was officially employed at Cal Tech, but my lab wasn't ready yet, so I moved in January of '97 (1997).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you were there, you got a grant from the National Science Foundation--no, no, you won the National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award?
Speaker 2: Correct.  Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what did you do, you think, that called the National Science Foundation's attention to you?
Speaker 2: Well, so this is a program that people apply to.  And so, I don't know how many they award a year, but it's not--it's not, you know, a handful a year, there are a number of them a year.  And so, at that time, in particular, it was a lot about the references that people would provide like any--it's almost like getting a faculty job that if people say this person is a star then--then you get the award.  And so, people who are writing the letters are basing that on what I had done on my PhD work and, you know, all the things that I had done, and so they wrote strong letters, and I had received that award.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you moved on to Cal Tech and you've been here ever since?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, Cal Tech.  (unclear) for the physicist, Richard--
Speaker 2: Feynman.
Speaker 1: Feynman, right.  Did you meet him?
Speaker 2: No.  He had passed.  But his grandson is in my son's class, across the street, at the school across the street.
Speaker 1: Now, we have a lot of stories about Richard Feynman, and his grateousness in terms of sharing his knowledge to students and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --With everybody, but a lot of people we've interviewed have met him.
Speaker 2: So, I know his daughter, whose again, that she's a mother of a child in our class, so.
Story_ID: 23595
Speaker 1: So, what have been your--so when you were here, now I don't want to jump ahead but what you did, now correct me if I'm wrong, from what we understand, anyway, is what you've done, is that you fabricated the first solid acid fuel cell--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --So this is really big.
Speaker 2: It is big.  It is big.  It--it--I mean, I--you know, it's--you know it's hard to put these things in context and so on, but I mean, I--I'd like to describe it as the first sort of new idea in fuel cells in a long, long, long time in cen--in decades.  There have been some things that have come out new now in terms of different--different materials since then that have been new and interesting ideas, but we did that in 2001 in my lab, and I was--it was really quite significant, I mean, people thought these materials were not very interesting and not very useful and we were demonstrating, no actually, it solves a lot of problems that people know exists with existing materials.  So, that was a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now being an engineer, you're concerned with creating things, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Things that did exist before?
Speaker 2: Right.  Actually, here's my other very fun quote.  You asked me which quotes do I like.  So Von Carmen had a quote.  No offense to my colleagues who are scientists, but his quote was that scientists study the world the way that it is and engineers create the world the way as they imagine it; it's something to that effect.  And so, I liked that one also.
Speaker 1: Often I heard scientists say, when asked what they've done and what their legacy is they say, well, I created something or I discovered something that, you know, I'm not sure how it's going to be used--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Or who or how it fits into the rest of the--but I know I came up with something that took a lot of time and energy, I discovered this process or this feature--
Speaker 2: This phenomena.
Speaker 1: This phenomena, right.  An engineer doesn't say that, right?
Speaker 2: Well, an engineer, I mean, again, it's a gray scale, so it's--there is certainly a lot of discovery that goes on as well.  And as I said, in terms of materials, it's--it's--it's a field that has in its name material science and engineering, because there is a big emphasis of discovery and of phenomena.  I mean, if you put these two elements together, what new thing are you possibly going to get.  And maybe you don't anticipate in advance exactly what that new phenomena is going to be, or you have an inkling of something unusual is going to happen, but I don't know how big this effect is going to be.  And then there's also the aspect of saying, "well, I have a need here, and how--how can I come with the material that meets this need."  And both are extremely creative and both are valuable.  I just happened to see myself a little bit more on the engineering side.  I see the need and I'm going to put my energies into solving that need.  And that's different from what I did as my PhD, which is why I tell you that I probably wouldn't have done that same PhD research, who I am today.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Kind of walk us through how you were able to fabricate this solid acid fuel cell?
Speaker 2: By getting really good graduate students.  (laughing)  Because at this point, I'm not in the lab anymore, by 2001.  So, I mean, essentially, it was luck.  We had this material; we brainstormed with the students how it should--how we could get it to work.  This is the way you should put this together.  These are the components you should add to it, and okay, you know, go in the lab and try it.  And, you know, I'm there for bouncing off ideas, but really, I'm not the one, physically, putting the things together.  So, but how did we do it, I mean, it's actually--I don't want to--it's hard for me to describe it in words that make any sort of sense.  The electrolyte material that we use is a lot like a salt.  If you look at it, it looks like salt or sugar crystals, and they have to be compacted together in a way that means that there's no gas leakage or (unclear).  So imagine, you know, taking salt or sugar and just pressing it down really hard so that you have almost a transparent disc and then putting electrodes and catalyst materials on either side, and then putting it into a test structure, test rig, basically, where you can bring hydrogen on one side, oxygen on the other side and then measure the voltage across that, just like you'd measure the voltage on a battery.  And so that's essentially what we did.  And it sounds very simple and, you know, there's a lot of details in there, how to actually get that to work.
Speaker 1: So these are fuel cells meaning that you can store energy in these--
Speaker 2: So what a fuel cell does, it's really an alternative to a combustion engine, so its function is very similar to a combustion engine.  It takes a fuel and gives you some other useful form of energy.  Combustion engine, okay, is giving you mechanical energy, and a fuel cell it taking that fuel and giving you electrical energy.  So that's--that's what it does.  All energy technologies are actually just energy conversion, but this is the conversion that we're doing, and the easiest thing to compare it to, in terms of functionality, is a combustion engine.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this energy would be connected to an electrical engine, I guess, a motor.
Speaker 2: Right.  Electrical motor.
Speaker 1: You'd drive and turn a shaft and drive--
Speaker 2: So if you want mechanical work out of it, you put it to electrical motor, if you say, hey, I just want it to run my lap top, then you just get the DC electrical power out of it directly.
Speaker 1: --Okay, if you want it to warm something, you use it another way?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Or cool something?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Just hook it up to the right apparatus?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right. So this solid acid fuel cell, is this the wave of the future, I mean, is this--
Speaker 2: I'm hoping, I'm hoping, I mean, so it solves a lot of problems that fuel cells have because it's at just the right temperature.  We're still hopeful that we won't need platinum catalyst for it.  So there's a lot--there's a lot that we're still doing to make it better, but we see the path.  And because not many people are in this area, it's a little bit harder to convince whichever groups they might be that this the wave for the future, but, you know.  I had a colleague who said to me once, "You know that's great to lead, but how come there aren't people following you?"  But it's starting to happen, so.
Story_ID: 23596
Speaker 1: Well, you know, alternative energy, I know the President spoke to it, in his inaugural address in 2008, and, you know, then there was a fiasco with, I think a company that made--
Speaker 2: Cylinder.
Speaker 1: --Yeah, it was a cylinder, right.  So, it seems to be a political aspect of, you know, what's the right form of alternative energy, what's going to be popular.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and it goes back and forth.  I mean, under Bush, it was hydrogen, and under Obama it's batteries, I mean, so.  And then it's a little bit of all the above.  Who knows, I mean it's--it's an area where Congress is involved in every single step.  And when I talk to my colleagues, for example, who are in computer science, electrical engineering, it's not like they have Congress telling them, you know, what the next consumer electronics is going to be, there is complete trust in the scientists--scientists and engineers that they can figure it out, that they're going to come up with, you know, innovations that are gonna make sense.  But in the energy side, everyone wants to tell the scientists and the engineers what they should do, so.
Story_ID: 23597
Speaker 1: So, what does it look like, you know, from your vantage point, you know, what should it be, I mean what should--where should we be going?
Speaker 2: So this is a hard question to answer because deep, deep down I am quite certain that policy will solve much more of our energy problems in the near term than scientific and technical breakthroughs.  There's just no doubt about it.  But we are reluctant to make policy decisions that may be a little bit tough and a little bit hard on peoples' lifestyles.  And so we just continue to wait and hope that science and engineering will come up with a breakthrough.  So, I'm trying to do that and to allow that to happen, and I think that, you know, there's a lot, there's a lot going on with solar cells, there's a lot going on with--with, you know, carbon dioxide capture from the atmosphere, there's a whole lot going on.  I just have a fear that by relying on the science and engineering to solve the problems that we postpone this policymaking that could give us some breathing space in the near term.
Story_ID: 23598
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what entities were interested in your discovery?
Speaker 2: Car companies were, for some period.  So right now, the interest level and fuel cells is not high, it sort of went down with the change in--in presidential leadership.  It was very high under Bush and less high under Obama.  But in my group fuel cells is not the only thing that we do, we also do this new topic called solar fuels, which is that you use sunlight to make--to take carbon dioxide and water and use that--using the energy of the sun to create fuels from that, so we do work in that area as well.  And so there's a lot of interest in that part.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Solar fuels, okay--
Speaker 2: Quite frankly, you know, in all of these aspects, science and engineering, in general, and energy science and engineering more narrowly, I would say that traveling overseas, there's much more interest in it than there is the U.S.  There's--I often feel that I can easily, you know, just have, you know, if I wanted to, just move to China and have all the money I wanted in my laboratory to do this research; just the feeling of what's the importance of science and engineering to society overall.  It's just a much higher level overseas than it is here, so.
Speaker 1: So what country--would it be China, or what country would be the--would you consider to be a model for how--
Speaker 2: How to invest?
Speaker 1: Yeah, invest in science and engineering?
Speaker 2: Well, certainly China values science and engineering, but then there are other aspects, of course, which they don't value, which is, you know, open discussion, right, so that's the trade off, so.  Yeah, so, ultimately where does one want to be when you take all that into account.  It's you know, certainly--certainly happy to be living in the U.S.  But I think that valuing science and engineering is done much more in other countries.  And it goes back to this point that I made earlier, that if you're the kid who raises your hand in class, in many other countries, that's--that's the positive, you know, that people say, "wow, that's great, you're smart, you know the answer."  In the U.S., that's negative.  So, I think it's just this cultural aspect.  Also the disdain that some portions of the U.S. population have for an intellectual president.  I mean, it's just phenomenal to me.  Isn't that who you'd want?  Wouldn't you want somebody smart to be your leader?  Maybe you don't agree with all their policies, but surely you want someone smart.  And that's just not really valued.  And I think most other countries, you know, value it.  And I don't know how long the U.S. can last that way.  There's always this sense that, you know, that other countries are putting in so much more money into science and engineering and other sort of hardcore intellectual endeavors, not the, I mean, why are we--why do we have society at all, of course, ultimately, it's having to do things with arts, and you know, and all that part of intellectual endeavors that make us more than other animals on this planet, right.  I mean, that's why we do it all, that's why we want to have labor-saving devices so that we can enjoy these intellectual aspects of life, and so the U.S. is really good about that part, but if you don't have the other part supporting it, it's not going to last.  And so it will be interesting to see where this all heads.  I know it would be very helpful if the U.S. would start to say, "ah hah, you know what, what makes our great life possible, is actually science and engineering breakthroughs, and maybe we should go back to supporting that effort again, instead of waiting until we fall behind."
Story_ID: 23599
Speaker 1: Okay.  What is water splitting?
Speaker 2: So that's this part of the solar fuels idea.
Speaker 1: Is it, okay.
Speaker 2: So the idea is look, if you have hydrogen. I think most people recognize hydrogen as a fuel.  And the way you get the energy out of the hydrogen is by burning it with oxygen.  You burn it, you get a flame, you can do stuff with that, with all that heat that's being released.  The product of that is water, right, so you bring hydrogen and oxygen together, you get water.  So if you could split the hydrogen and oxygen back and separate them, then you would have your hydrogen fuel to start off with again.  So you're just undoing that combustion to give you some fuel.  But you need to put energy in you can't get energy out without putting energy in.  And so the ideal is where do you get that energy.  Well, if you could get that from sunlight, that's great, because that's great, because that's, you know, a sustainable energy source.  So how do you do that process.  And the reason that's it's also good from sunlight is that, you know, we don't have a good way of storing solar energy, but if you--if you made a chemical energy fuel like hydrogen or anything else, which is a fuel, than that's really easy to store, compared to trying to store sunlight.
Story_ID: 23600
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, in '97 (1997), you received the TMS Robert Lansing Hardy Award.  Now, what was that?
Speaker 2: That was for exceptional promise as a material scientist.  So, that was fun, it was nice.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In 2000, you received the Cobalt Award from the American Ceramics--
Speaker 2: Also for exceptional promise as a ceramics scientist, yep.
Speaker 1: --Now, ceramics, what was your contribution, or what were you looking at in terms of ceramics?
Speaker 2: Well, ceramics is so when you think of it from a popular prospective, you think of making, you know, pottery and clay, but it's a category of materials which just means, let's see if we have any examples here of any ceramics.
Speaker 1: Clay-based materials?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's not necessarily clays.  It means--there's not a single example of a ceramic here.  Most things are metals or plastics or cloth.  But it's--it's--it is the same ceramics in the sense, I mean, things you make mugs out of are ceramics, but those, that class of materials is used for all sorts of other applications, as well, including, as I mentioned, the batteries and fuel cells and so on, and our water-splitting process, as well, we use ceramics, so it's--it's a category of materials which are materials that are like the ceramics you're familiar with are brittle, can withstand high temperatures, they don't burn; metals will oxidize and corrode, but ceramics don't do that.  So that's that category of materials.
Story_ID: 23601
Speaker 1: I almost forgot about this.  Now, I read about you demonstrating some aspect of, I guess, of water-splitting, I guess, with hydrogen and oxygen by drinking a tailpipe emissions of a car--
Speaker 2: No, no, that was to show that water that you produce from a fuel cell is pure water.  And astronauts did this, actually.  They had a fuel cell on Apollo 13 mission, or whichever one it was, you take hydrogen and oxygen, you know, that you're gonna run in a fuel cell to give you electric power on the rocket and then the product that it creates is water.  And the idea is that it's clean enough to drink, and so that's what astronauts did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is out of a tailpipe, though, which means people cringe, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Cal Tech [California Institute of Technology] administration was not happy that I did that.
Speaker 1: They really weren't?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Because it's true that if you're actually driving a car on the streets, it would get polluted from just where it is, right.  So, in that instance, because the car, itself, was brand new and clean, there was nothing that polluted the tailpipe.  The only thing that's coming out is the water, but if you were, you know, just even if you had your--even if you had a clean cup sitting there as a tailpipe, you wouldn't use that cup and just pour water directly into it, right.  I mean--that's what I mean.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  So, it was just the fact that you were driving this around, it would get polluted just from the environment, not from necessarily what was going through it, which is pure water; it would get just from the stuff in the air and being close to the ground.
Speaker 1: So you were just verifying the purity of the process rather than--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Okay.  Now, in let's see, 2001, you received the JB Wanger Award--
Speaker 2: Wagner.
Speaker 1: --I'm sorry, Wagner--
Speaker 2: The Electric Chemical Society.
Speaker 1: --Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Again, exceptional promise.
Story_ID: 23602
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So there were a lot of these awards, I guess.  Now, in 2008, some of your graduate students, are these good graduate students, I guess, start the Superprotonic Company--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --In Pasadena?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So are you a part of that?
Speaker 2: I'm an informal scientific advisor.  So the company still exists; it's two blocks from here.  And it has a different name now, SafCell, but it's still trying to commercialize the salt acid fuel cells.
Story_ID: 23603
Speaker 1: Okay.  So we were talking about Superprotonic.  Now, what's the name of the company?
Speaker 2: Safcell.  S-A-F-C-E-L-L.
Speaker 1: Just as an outside observer, it seems to make more sense to me than superprotonic, you know.  I mean--
Speaker 2: We had a, yeah.  No, no, the first company was shut down by the investors, so they started over--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --And they were not able to take the name.
Speaker 1: --Okay, but they wanted to keep that name?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  They would have, if the investors would have allowed them.
Speaker 1: So, they're manufacturing the fuel cells.
Speaker 2: Manufacturing might be a stretch of the word, because there are not customers who are willing to pay the cost, so it's still a development company.  So, in my laboratory, we, you know, do much more fundamental science of, you know, just probing the properties of material and what makes it useful in this fuel cell application, and at the company, then they say, okay, let's build the demonstration device, but we rely on investors or government funding to support that effort in actually building a device.  So, it's a big step between testing an individual piece of material to making, you know, a functioning fuel cell, and so that's where they spend their money, but they haven't--they don't have customers, per se, that they can sell those to.  There was one customer that agreed to purchase a demonstration device, but mostly they're--they're just, you know, relying on investors to coming in to support that effort so that one day they can--they can start selling, you know, manufactured components.
Story_ID: 23604
Speaker 1: Okay, so 2008, you received an award from the American Competitiveness and Innovation for--in American Competitiveness and the Innovation from the National Science Foundation, and you were also named by News Week as one of the twelve prominent individuals to watch in 2008.
Speaker 2: Yes, that was fun.  So the ACI Fellowship from NSF was, I mean, it was something I was proud to receive.  I mean, I was very grateful for NSF for also awarding me that.  And that was for, you know, sort of overall link, you know, contributions over the past ten years, of all the different things, and also for making, you know, in their words, outreach at all levels; so making sure to be inclusive in the things that I do in my laboratory.
Story_ID: 23605
Speaker 1: Okay, so are you continuing now, I mean, today, in 2012, are you still perfecting the fuel cell, or--
Speaker 2: Certainly, and so, we started off--so, the fuel cell has got, a lot like a battery, three components, the electrolyte, so, in a battery, that some sort of sulfuric acid or something, and then an anode and a cathode.  So, where we started off, was we had this great material that was going to work as an electrolyte.  So we demonstrated it works as an electrolyte, that's really useful.  And we did a lot of work to improve that component.  And now we're working to improve the anode and cathode components.  That means that you'll get more power out of the fuel cell if you can make the anode and cathode better.  It also means there's a possibility of eliminating platinum, which is very expensive and only available from South Africa, basically.  So that's--those are the parts that we're really focused on now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, what do you see--do you really see that these fuel cells will be the future of our energy storage?
Speaker 2: I think most certainly they'll have a role.  I mean, it's hard for me to imagine why not.  There were some, you know, there's always risk, right, so you don't know for sure will they actually make it, but everything is pointing in the right way.  I mean, fuel cells are having a hard time because they're generally expensive compared to combustion.  Again, that's what you're--you're competing against, the gas turbine.  So, you're gonna deliver natural gas to it, and you're gonna produce electricity.  And so, which one is cheaper, is really what it comes down to.  From the environmental perspective, the fuel cell is advantageous, because there's no pollutants, there's--it's this all cell state device, so there's no noise associated with it, so it has some significant advantages, ideally, it's also more efficient, so that's an advantage as well.  But the cost is still high, the absolute cost.  And it also ties in the policy issues, so if you were willing to put a price tag on the cost of polluting the environment, then all of a sudden the fuel cell is much more cost-effective.  But we don't know who should pay for that so we just don't include that in pricing of things, right.  So that makes the combustion engine more cost-effective for the consumer, because who's paying for all that acid rain that results from combustion, I mean, it's not the person who's buying that--that power plant.
Story_ID: 23606
Speaker 1: Now, I've never investigated this, but there's a popular culture idea in certain circles that's floating around that we already had a viable electric car at some point, you know, and there's even a movie called "Who Killed the Electric Car?"
Speaker 2: Yep.  Yeah, I mean I think there's--there's a lot of shenanigans that go on with the big companies.  I think that, you know, I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I think that--so with the electric cars, I think that the companies were offering them at a loss; many times they were leased, because they didn't want something to go wrong with them and then have a big liability issue.  And so when they stopped--decided they weren't going to support it anymore, because they didn't think it was going to move forward, they wanted to get them back, because they didn't want to put in the money to support that maintenance of cars that they didn't think had a future, so all those leased cars, they said you got to send them back, because this market is not emerging as far as we can see.  So there's no point in us spending--continue to spend money on the electric cars.  So, what I see, also, is that these decisions are very--people are kind of (unclear) in that way, just as I said about the kids and their belief that they all wear different clothes, and the fact they all wear the same; this is how the investors are, this is how the big companies are, no one wants to be the first.  And, in fact, in the technology sense, there's no benefit, because if you're the one who's first, likely it's the person who comes in second who's going to make all the money.  You're going to go in there, you're going to make all the mistakes and number two is going to come in and then clean up.  So no one wants to be number one, so they all sort of go the same direction.   So, you know, and I don't think it's a big conspiracy theory, as I said, it's not active--the only place I see conspiracy theory is the funding to discredit climate change, but that's--that's the only--like funding to claim that tobacco is not addictive, so.
Story_ID: 23607
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that could be a whole long discussion, but we're not going to go there right now.  In 2007, your sister wrote a book called "Held at a Distance and Rediscovery of Ethiopia".  She returned after 25 years.  Have you been back, yourself?
Speaker 2: About two years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did you think of your sister's trip back, and what's your--
Speaker 2: I mean, I resonated, obviously with the things that she said.  You know, it was a great read, you know.  Obviously, it's very personal, from, you know, for me reading it.  But a lot of things that she said were really accurate.  I mean, yeah, I don't know what else to add to that.  You know, it's after going back, after so many years, and on the one hand, it's hard to say things have changed, because there's not such a strong view of what it was like before.  So when people asked me did you find a change, I said, well, I hardly have a vision of what it was before, so it's just, you know, it's what it is.  The only thing that changed for me was going to my elementary school and then, you know, and everybody has this experience that it's just much smaller than what you remember, because you were small and the building seemed big, but when you go now, it's like "wow, these buildings are tiny," and so, yeah.  But she also spent more time, sort of exploring and traveling around much more than I did, and I was there for a short time, mostly, in Addis Ababa, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are you related at all, or a member of the extended Ethiopian community now in the United States?
Speaker 2: A little bit, a little bit.  I'm pretty focused on my work, so.
Story_ID: 23608
Speaker 1: Not unlike a lot of scientists, research scientists.  So, we always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns today for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  How to (unclear) that down, I mean,  I think, yeah, yeah, how to (unclear) that down, I mean, I think there's--there's still a lot of undercurrent bias that happens in this country, because it's hard to see how you get out of it; how do you get out of the fact that we have such huge economic disparity and that just ties into everything else.  And it seems--it's not clear to me how we get around that.  And so, if we think about fixing economic injustice, then, well, you know, we're messing with capitalism, and that's not really acceptable.  But until we solve that, I don't see how a large fraction of African Americans who are disproportionally impoverished will--will  have opportunity.  I just--I don't see how we can fix that.  You know, in Pasadena, there's a lot of wealth, and there's also a lot of poverty.  When my--I had--one of my cousins I adopted, she's like twenty years younger than me, and she went to junior high and high school in Pasadena.  The first year she went to public school.  The public school was maybe 95 percent underrepresented between Hispanic and African American, a few Asians, a few Caucasian.  Valedictorian in the class was either like one of the two, I can't remember, probably Asian.  Every--Anyone who has any money in Pasadena sends their kids to private school.  So it's--it's just, you know, so I just can't imagine, if you--you cannot send your kids to public school in Pasadena and have them be successful.  And so, if you're not in that wealthy group, you're stuck.  And that's predominantly African American in this town.  That's not--I don't see how you get around that.  And then everything else connects into that, right, it connects into when the cops stop you on the street, because you're African American, they assume that you must be, you know, doing something wrong, right, and that really happened to me in Pasadena, it's happened to me in other wealthy areas, right.  I mean, everybody kind of experiences it once and a while.  So all of that is connected, and I don't know how we can fix it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I value education.
Story_ID: 23609
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done at the point, is there any major thing that you would change, if you could go back and change something?
Speaker 2: You know, I, at one point in my life, decided that I was not going to have regrets and guilt, you know, that you learn from some experience and then you just move on and you shouldn't dwell on, "I wish I had done that differently," because you can't.  I mean, you make the best decisions that you can, given the information that you have, and I think that probably in maybe trying to put a positive spin, that, in most circumstances, I think I made what was logically the right decision, and maybe I didn't have all the information, and maybe I was, you know, slightly off, and yeah, whatever, you just move on.  I don't think--I don't like to dwell on that kind of thing, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23610
Speaker 1: Likewise, when you look back on all your accomplishments, what today would you consider to be your legacy, even though you're still young compared to who we normally interview.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think that, you know, you obviously picked up on the salt acid fuel cells, I think that we are on the cusp of bringing that to commercial realization, that's going to be fun.  I think that our solar fuels work; as making big impacts already, and I think that would be a part of it.  But really, as an academic, the legacy we have are the students that we create.  And so the students that we've trained, and you know, it's my first student is the president of Safecell, and you know, I just--I just am thrilled when I see how he progresses, and I have a student who's an assistant professor at Stamford now, and I was thrilled when I see the awards that he gets, I mean, that's--that's really what we've done.
Story_ID: 23611
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, tell us a little bit about your family.  Now your--you must have gotten married along the way, so you've got a couple of children?
Speaker 2: Right, right, yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You want to tell us about your family?
Speaker 2: So, kids are, (unclear) older son just turned ten today.  Ten years old, November 29th.  And my younger son is eight, and their dad is also here at Cal Tech [California Institute of Technology], and so we just live close by, and the kids love the fact that we live two houses from where Einstein lived when he was at Cal Tech.  So, and the kids love science, and they love Cal Tech and all is good.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is your father still living?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And your mother?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Are they pretty much settled in the United States today?
Speaker 2: Yes.  The political environment is still not conducive for travel in Ethiopia, and then my father's health is, obviously, not very good, so he's loath to too much travel.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: All three siblings live in New York City, and then my adopted siblings, one lives in Washington, D.C., and one lives in Minnesota.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, is there anything I haven't asked you about that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Nope.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Maybe I need a drink of water for this last question. Okay.
Story_ID: 23612
Speaker 1: All right.  Last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I think I would like to be remembered for what  one of my former students called me up about, which was sort of their moral compass, that you can be successful, have this huge impact on science and a huge impact on students, and you can do with high standards.  There's a lot of discussion in this day and era about science becoming more competitive and you may have heard--seen the article about Harvard [Harvard University] students cheating and so on, that somehow, that we can maintain high integrity above all of that despite the temptations and the pressures, real pressures, I mean, I understand like people have trouble, and you know, with a lot of--there are lot of cultural issues that also are arising in science about plagiarism where maybe some other culture's view, you know, copying a sentence as being an homage to the person who wrote it by--but--but, you know, there's all these issues that come up, and I think, what I would like to be remembered for is that there was nothing like that on my record, I mean, that is was--that it is a spotless record with high achievement, that's what I want to be remembered for.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you for sharing with us.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Good luck on your proposal, too.
Speaker 2: Thanks.  Thanks, indeed.
