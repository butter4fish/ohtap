Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five People magazine-ish type questions, we always ask, there are lightweight questions that only deserve a lightweight answer.  And the first question is, sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Well, that's a difficult question, (pause) I like leafy green vegetables, so I would have to say spinach.

Speaker 1: All right.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?

Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  Now, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?

Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 150507
Speaker 1: I want to ask you some questions about your family history.  I'm gonna ask you about your father's side and your mother's side.  And, we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My mother's name was Lucille Gwendolyn Herriford Robinson. She came to be known as Gwendolyn when she came to Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  Everyone from her hometown of Kansas City [Missouri] called her, called her Lucille, L-U-C-I-L-L-E, G-W-E-N-D-O-L-Y-N, H-E-R-R-I-F-O-R-D, R-O-B-I-N-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth was 1 December 1918 [December 1, 1918], Kansas City, Missouri.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, what do you know about her side of the family?  How far back you trace that?
Speaker 2: My grandmother, Ethel Dabney [ph.], grew up in Lynchburg, Virginia.  She was a first cousin to the Scotts [ph.].  I'm now third cousin to the third generation of Scotts.  My grand, grandfather's family grew up in Chillicothe, Missouri on the Herriford Plantation.  Hence, they came to be called the name, Herriford.  His father was an educator, as were, as was he, and his two brothers and his sister.  They were very musically inclined, everyone played an instrument.  My great-grandfather [Joseph E.] Herriford [Sr.] was principal of a high school [W.W. Yates School] in Kansas City, Missouri.  Neal Herriford, Joe Herriford's brother, my great uncle, my mother's uncle finished Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts] in English and taught at Lincoln High School [later, Lincoln College Preparatory Academy] in Kansas City.  Neal was a surgeon in St. Louis, Missouri.  He went to Howard University to medical school.  He was a surgeon, I'm not quite sure with, what Vida [ph.] did, I only met Vida once.  And then there was another brother, Leon [ph.], who lived in New York City [New York], who I only once, I'm not quite sure what he did.  But, I'm almost sure they were all involved in education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my grandfather, Joseph E. Herriford [Jr.], taught at Lincoln High School in Kansas City, Missouri, and finished Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, is that that family goes all the way back to Chillicothe, Missouri?
Speaker 2: Chillicothe, Missouri. (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And they were, they were owned at one time by somebody in Herriford, or?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure if they were owned, but they worked on the Herriford farm, or the Herriford plantation.
Speaker 1: Okay, but they, they may have been free?
Speaker 2: They were free, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, they were free. (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: They were free, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: They were free.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Story_ID: 150508
Speaker 1: So are there any stories about the Civil War, about the Reconstruction or any of that time period that come down through your family?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my great-grandfather [Joseph E. Herriford, Sr.] actually wrote a paper about the family and I have a copy of it.  He did original watercolor drawings of the Herriford house and each of the family members.  And, it's not a long story, it's only about three pages long, but it's fairly detailed.  He talks about each of the children and their, their abilities and what he thought they would do in life.  And, he talks about each of them playing musical instruments; that's how the family was very musically inclined.  Mother [Lucille Gwendolyn Herriford Robinson] never took piano lessons, but played the piano by ear.  She would just sit, she would hear a tune and sit down and play the piano and be able to play that tune.
Speaker 1: Okay. That sound, were they a part of any musical groups we would know about, or, or?
Speaker 2: Well, we grew up in Kansas City [Missouri], there was Kansas City Jazz [District] on 18th [Street] and Vine [Street], and when I would go there as a young man, as a, you know as a little boy, my grandfather, Joe Herriford [Joseph E. Herriford, Jr.] would take me down and introduce me to everybody down there, including Arthur, Arthur [Bryant] and Charlie Bryant, who owned [Arthur] Bryant's Barbecue.  So, he was, he was part of that fair, being and had took many of these people who were, who were in high school (unclear).  And, my, my grandfather used to have this story about how he ran away and played with the circus.  He played a, a trumpet, how he ran away and played the trumpet in the circus, for, for a period of time.  And, my aunt, Lucy Wilkinson [ph.], who also lived in Kansas City, said that there were, my grandfather had a, was a great storyteller, said that he, he went away for weeks some place and played with circus while they were in town.  He didn't run away and play with the circus. (Laughter)
Speaker 1: And so he kind of embellished the story?
Speaker 2: He had great stories.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He told great stories.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 150509
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us about your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us, please.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He's Harry Granville Robinson, Jr., H-A-R-R-Y, R-O-B--G-R-A-N-V-I-L-L-E, R-O-B-I-N-S-O-N, Jr.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth, and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in Washington, D.C. in February 3rd, 1908.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about his side of the family?
Speaker 2: My grandfather, Harry G. Robinson, Sr. was an orphan.  There's not much known about his family. He had a, he had a cousin here in Washington that I knew when I was a young lad, but I didn't know, I didn't know much about him.  He had a moving company and I had photographs of him with his moving vans.  He had a, some little truck called a Gramm, G-R-A-M-M, Gramm truck and it was the state of the art moving van.  I'm sure Gramm [-Bernstein Company] has since gone out of business.  And, I have a photograph that was very small brown photograph that I gave to a friend who owned, owned a photograph and reproduction company.  And, he blew them up for me in black and white, and his only cost, his only charge was that he, he wanted a copy of the picture of the truck because he was an aficionado of antique trucks, and was really excited that he had found a photograph of the Gramm moving truck.  With this, with this moving company, he put eight children through college.  Unfortunately, no one kept the moving company going.  They were all teachers and government employees.  My uncle retired as a colonel in the [U.S.] Army in 1953, so nobody kept the moving company going.  On my grandmother's side of the family, the Hill side of the family, her name was Mamie Isabelle Hill Robinson.  Her father, James Henry Hill taught at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and in the 1880s [1880s].  He organized here their manual arts program, here at Howard University, which is really one of the major programs when Howard started.  And, subsequently, retired from Howard University and went to organize the same program for the [Washington] D.C. public schools.  James Henry Hill was a master craftsman and was a real estate developer.  He had probably two dozen properties in the city.  He drew a part (unclear).  He'd build houses, and he'd draw a cart and then rented them out or sold them.  The reason that my side of the family doesn't have any money is that my great-great-grandmother died.  Mamie Isabelle Hill Robinson's mother died and James Henry Hill married someone else, who I'll send you photographs of.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: I think she was predominately American Indian and black.  She had a daughter, Katy Joyner, who was Katy Hill Joyner [ph.].  On his death bed, she convinced my great-grandfather, James Henry Hill to sign her complete authority over his estate which was, which was sizeable.  And, my grandmother was a very nice, gentile woman and never questioned that in court.  And, subsequently, when, when, they called her Sister Minnie [ph.]; when Sister Minnie died, Katy Joyner got the entire grandfather's estate.  'Cause, it tracked, it went from her natural mother to the daughter; and my grandmother and her sister didn't get any of my great-grandfather's estate.  I wrote a book on Howard University, and one of the things that we did was we tracked every land transfer at the recorder of deeds that  Frederick Douglass, was, in fact, in charge of, charge of, for a period of time.  We tracked every land transfer and I saw in there James Henry Hill property been sold to the university or sold to other people.  There was one the rest of the property (unclear) there's a, there's a story that I thought was fable all of my life.  My father used to say, "Son, you know I was born in Howard University Stadium [Greene Memorial Stadium] on the fifty yard line."  I said, "Dad, you know, you know, you're a, you're a nice guy and I know you believe that, but this is Howard Stadium."
Speaker 1: (Laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, he wasn't the kind of guy to argue with me, I mean he knew what he was talking about.  When we tracked these land sales, in fact, I saw where he had sold, where my grandmother and grandfather had sold property to Howard University in the 1920s; that in fact, was Howard's fifty yard line for the stadium.  It was then on 6th Street, where Howard's on 6th Street and they were in the stadium and they sold that property to Howard University for the stadium.  So, in fact, he was born on Howard's fifty yard line, which thus, begins my long journey in connection with Howard University.
Speaker 1: Okay, right on the fifty. (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Right on the fifty, yeah. (Laughter).
Story_ID: 150510
Speaker 1: Well, tell us a little bit about your parents [Lucille Gwendolyn Herriford Robinson and Harry Granville Robinson, Jr.].  Tell us about your mother; what kind of a person was she and what did she do?
Speaker 2: Oh, she was a great woman.  She was a homemaker.  My father finished Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] in 1934 when there weren't many jobs around, ended up working at the post office; which in Washington, D.C., in those times was a great job.  I mean it was steady, you got overtime at Christmas, you had some respect.  Most of Howard's attorneys worked in the post office at night and practiced law in the day.  That was, that was sort of the vessel through which they had continual money to keep, keep their practice going.
Speaker 1: That's right, I've heard that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I heard some of these stories.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Howard University was a--many of them worked in the post office and it was a good job if you could get it.  Mother was a homemaker, she worked for a period of time, I guess in the '50s [1950s] for the [U.S.] Census Bureau when they were doing one of the censuses.  My father was in work at night.  He would come home, give her the car.  She would drive out to Silver [Hill Road] for the census and she would come home and we'd have dinner together.  My father would go to work at 10:30 at the, at the post office.  She was a great woman.  She had, she came down, they actually met when she came to Howard University.  She came to Howard University from Kansas City [Missouri] and she and my father dated, I guess, over some period of time and fell in love, and got married; great homemaker, we didn't have much money, but I never knew that.  And, she, she had the ability to just do things.  She could, she had great intellectual abilities that translated into the ability to design and make, she was a wonderful, wonderful cook; made every knit you can imagine.  If they were invited to a big dance some place, we actually, obviously didn't have money to go to the great stores, and buy a dress.  So, we would go down to the store and look at and sketch it and come home and make it.  And, you couldn't tell what she had made from what they were selling downtown in the, in the large department stores.  Very loving mother.  Her grandkids loved her, you know, they called her Granny.  Everybody, everybody loved this woman.  She looked a lot like I look.  I looked like her earlier.  Now, I'm beginning to look more like my father as I, and, and James Henry [Hill], as I get older.
Speaker 1: Yeah. (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Social woman, had thousands of friends, you would meet her, Larry, and in five minutes, you'd be telling her your life and asking her for advice.  I mean, she was, she was Martha, the black Martha Stewart of the '50s [1950s].  We, we had a house here on 500 Georgia Avenue until the day that I finished the fifth grade, sixth grade which is 1953 [1953].  There came a time, I guess, in junior high school, when in, roughly three or four years, my sister and I would be going to college.  And, you know, Dental School [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.]--who was from Kansas City, his wife was from Kansas City, Russell Dixon, offered mother a job in Howard's Dental School and that's how I went to college, 'cause we couldn't afford it, 'cause it what'd about $120.00 a semester, but that was allowing me to buy a car for $120.00.  And, offered a job, which means I got to go to Howard University free and she worked at the dental school until she retired, in maybe, 19--1971 is when she retired from the dental school.  So, she worked at Howard's Dental School.
Story_ID: 150511
Speaker 1: She [Robinson's mother, Lucille Gwendolyn Herriford Robinson] and my father [Harry Granville Robinson, Jr.] had hundreds, thousands of friends.  The house was always full of people.  Growing up on Howard's [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] campus, I took for granted that the great scholars and professors and the soon to be presidents came by the house to play cards with my father on Friday night or Saturday night; and then I saw them walking down the street, they were just my father's friends, and--
Speaker 2: Who were some of these men?
Speaker 1: James Nabrit [Jr.], John Huguley, John W. Huguley, Sr., Jr. [sic, John W. Huguley, Jr.], chemist.  Charles Drew, I Willberden [ph.], the Drew kids at the college place on the southeast corner of Howard's campus.  I mean you named them.  Frank Rustler [ph.] was the first architect that I met, I didn't know anything about him being an architect then.  But, I remember that people would say, "You know that's Frank Rust--this guy is crazy."  And I saw that you know he was this creative person that had this energy that he had to get out, so he lived a life that was different than other people lived.  Zachary, Clarence Zachary [ph.], was a Howard University architect with Julian [Abele] Cook and others in that, that south lawn.  And, Zachary was really the, the image that I attached myself to; to become an architect and I'll, I'll tell you that story later.  But, there were all kind of people that came through our house.  Our house was always open.  I can bring anyone home, no matter who the person was that I met, I can bring them home; and we were having dinner, I could sit down with them, say, "This is my friend," the guy's name was Hank House [ph.], he was from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], he was a football player, defensive tackle, must have been seven feet tall and 280 pounds, he was always hungry.  I say, I say, you know I was a Howard, I was a Howard football team mascot.  I said, "Well, Hank, come on you can go home for dinner with me."  So, he took off his uniform, got his books.  I said, "This is my friend, Hank House."  He filled up the cavity of my apartment, small apartment.  And, my father said, "Well, sit down Hank, and have dinner."  And, he ate everything, everything that was left in the house, he ate.  But, you know, it was that, it was that kind of environment that my family created for me.
Story_ID: 150512
Speaker 1: My father [Harry Granville Robinson, Jr.] had gone to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] in '34 [1934], majored in physical education, wanted to be a coach, finished school. The post office was available, was thinking about getting married and, and he did that, he went to the post office.  He stayed there for thirty-five years.  He was a predictable.  Predictable from the stand point that he always did the right thing.  And, you knew that he was doing around family.  For example, he worked at the post office, got off at 3:30.  Before I got a car, if I wanted to go home, I knew his route, the same route every day, the same point at the same time, had somewhere to be along that route some place.  And, he would come along and I'd wave.  He said, "Come on, son," and we, we go home together.  I always knew where he was, there was never a time that I wasn't with him or that I didn't know where he was; which is a really grounding kind of experience to have as a young person.  You know, to always know where your father is, that you can count on him.  He was, he played basketball at Howard with Burke ["Mickey"] Syphax.   He and Burke Syphax said, "Going to high school here, in Washington, D.C., together."  I got a phone call last year from, gee, I think his name was, I want to say Charles Jackson, but his first name wasn't Charles, Frank Jackson [ph.].  Frank Jackson grew up on Denmark Street, off of Georgia [Avenue, Washington, D.C.] and was one of my father's childhood friends.  And, they went to [Paul Laurence] Dunbar High School [Washington, D.C.] together, now an academic high school here in Washington [D.C.].  And he told me, he said, "Son, you know, if your father had been a white man, he'd been playing in the, in the big leagues."  He was my father's catcher on the basketball team.  He said, "Your father's fast ball is faster than any fast ball of the day back there."  But, my father was, my father was a very modest man.  He wasn't one to self-promote.  He was a modest, kind man.  He was very thoughtful about what he did.
Story_ID: 150513
Speaker 1: Frank Jackson [ph.] and I have agreed to write a story about, with Charles Cassell, who is Albert Cassell's son, who did most of the things on campus, to write a story about growing up at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and be able to do those three generations.  We can do my father's [Harry Granville Robinson, Jr.] generation, and Charles Cassell is in between that and then my generation; just have to find time to do that.  I had my, my father had seven brothers and sisters.  One of them, Grace [ph.], most of them taught in the [Washington] D.C. public school system or social workers here.  Grace died before I was born.  My grandfather [Harry G. Robinson, Sr.] died the year before I was born.  He died in '41 [1941].  My grandmother [Mamie Hill Robinson], the family had sold the property and this is now Howard Stadium [Greene Memorial Stadium].  My great-grandfather had bought that property, James Henry Hill, and gave it to his two daughters who built houses there.  They sold that property and my family built a house on Georgia Avenue, 2714 Georgia Avenue [Washington, D.C.], which is a huge frame house, three-story frame house with back stairs, huge yard.   There was a, a, my grandmother was obviously up in age by the time I was born in '42 [1942].  And, because my grandfather had passed, I sort of became, I sort of became her pet because I lived across the street, I was over there all the time visiting.  It was a time when you didn't lock your front door; I mean I wanted to go in, I just opened the front door.  She was sitting behind the kitchen table all that she would cook.  And, some of my aunts lived there from time to time.  My first cousin, Dorothy Tucker [ph.], who's a daughter of Iola Clark, Iola Robinson Clark Scoffrey [ph.] who lived there from time to time.   It was the family home, that's where everybody came and it was a huge wall in front of it.  So, and, so Howard students, saw this, saw this being the Robinson home.  A huge front porch, it was always full of people, friends from Howard University.  My uncle and my father and Grace, went, and my aunt, Lil, went to Howard.  The other sisters went to Miner Teachers College [Washington, D.C.], which was the black, black (unclear) teachers college.  They taught in public, in D.C. public schools.  Uncle Jim went to Illinois for a degree, an advanced degree in civil engineering, was at the time of his retirement, the highest ranking Negro officer in the [U.S.] Army, was slated to be a general; made the mistake that I think, was the death toll to becoming a general.  Granted, Jet magazine in an interview before he was promoted and a southern congressman said, "Jet magazine doesn't promote generals, we promote generals," and that killed it.  He was with Beaumont Bradley [ph.] in the, in Korea.  Beaumont Bradley told him, "You know, Jim, if you were a white man, you'd be a general right now."
Speaker 2: What was his name, again, Jim?
Speaker 1: James Hill Robinson.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) Uncle Jim, one of my favorites.  Jim was a great, great guy, bright, got things done on time.  I called him a little general, he was, he was not a tall man.  But, his sons, he has one son who retired as a two star general, lives in Dallas [Texas], Hugh [ph.]; Hugh was at least six foot four [6'4"].  So, here was this guy that was smaller than I am, who had these huge sons.  My Aunt Ollie [ph.] taught at Walker-Jones School [later Walker-Jones Education Campus, Washington, D.C.] on, off of New Jersey Avenue for years.  She retired, they had, they bought a family home in Coltons Point, Maryland, which is a black community down, off the, off the [Chesapeake] Bay.  My mother's [Lucille Gwendolyn Herriford Robinson] sister, Lil Baltimore [ph.], owned that property.  Charlie Baltimore was my father's first cousin.  And, Charlie Baltimore taught at Armstrong [Armstrong Manual Training School, Washington, D.C.] house and then became principal of (unclear) vocational school, taught--and was the coach of Armstrong's great basketball team in the '40s [1940s], '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s] until Armstrong closed down.
Story_ID: 150514
Speaker 1: Like I told you before, my Aunt Vickie [ph.] worked for Charles Bresser [ph.] he was dean of the graduate school at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and subsequent to him went to Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] and retired there, retired and then came back to Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 2: She, she was Vickie, what was her last name?
Speaker 1: Her name was Victoria Robinson Dickerson, she was married to Richard Dickerson.  He was the comptroller of Central State, either the comptroller or the treasurer of Central State.  And she met him when she was out there.  Dick died when I was at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in 1970 and I don't think she retired, I mean never remarried.  She retired shortly after that and moved to Washington, D.C. and lived with my Aunt Ollie [ph.] and her daughter and that happened for a period of time.  Aunt Lil, Lillian Robinson Pugh [ph.] was a social worker in the [Washington] D.C. system for years, she passed in 1993, '94 [1994] somewhere.  Ollie, Vickie, my Aunt Dot, Dot, Dot, Dorothy [Hill] Robinson Homer [ph.], was head of the Harlem Public Library [Countee Cullen Library, New York Public Library, New York, New York], she was a historian, and she's the one who spent a lot of time with, I remember it was me and my brother-in-law, talking about the family history, we have hours and hours of tapes.  At some point we have to have them transcribed and put together, because my, my generation is not a single generation; all aunts, uncles, fathers, and grandparents pre-deceased me.
Speaker 2: She was head of the, what the--
Speaker 1: Harlem Public Library in New York [City].
Speaker 2: Okay.  (Background noise).
Speaker 1: She, she knew James Baldwin well.
Speaker 2: The Countee Cullen branch right there, on 100th, 135th St. [sic, 136th Street]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Had a library full of signed original books, from people who knew her. (Telephone ringing) James Baldwin books, and Charles Wesley books and you name them.  [Paul Laurence] Dunbar books, all kinds of books. She, she had one son, her husband was, he had a home, you know the pharmacy in Harlem [New York, New York].  She had one son get a home over there in the last year.  He retired from IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] and opened up an establishment, I think West Point Beach, Florida [sic, West Palm Beach, Florida].  It was a bar down in West Point Beach, Florida.  Went to Howard University for a while.  And that's, that's all the aunts and uncles, right?  Jim, Vickie, Dottie; they all--Grace had passed before I was born.  Very few siblings, very, very few cousins came out of this group of eight.  It's me and my sister and my Uncle Jim had three, two sons, both went to West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York]; a daughter who is a civil engineer.  Teddy Homer, Dorothy Homer's son and Dorothy Clark Tucker.  Those are the only kids that came out of those eight children.  They're--James Hill Robinson, Jr., he since passed, passed last summer.  And, Dorothy Tucker, died back in 1970--, in '77 [1977]. So--this, what was once a large family, a large extended family is now a very small family.  We have a--Hugh [ph.] has two children, Jimmy [ph.] has three, I have three, my sister has four. Teddy [ph.] didn't have any kids and Leonora [ph.] didn't have any kids.
Story_ID: 150515
Speaker 1: Do you have any sense of what it meant to be around that kind of active and accomplished family, as opposed to not being around that kind of (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I mean, now that you look back on it, I mean that is really an amazing group of individuals. (Laughter)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Let me tell you, let me tell you; my, my cousin, Leonora's [ph.] husband--we had a celebration, February we'd had a celebration for--I think that, that when my Uncle Jim died, it was '79 [1979], I had just became a dean here [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  And, somewhere, may be in--at the wake or at the repast after the funeral, it was something--(unclear) Dave said, "You know, this is a great American family."  What it meant to me was that whenever I thought about doing something that wasn't quite on track with what how people are supposed to act in a civil society; I was not going to be the one member of the family who didn't go to college. (Laughter)  I was not going to be the one member of the family that had any encounter with the police.  I was not going to be the one member of the family who was not successful at what they did. So, it set this bar that you had--and, and I never thought about not trying to reach the bar.  I mean, the bar was here (raising arm), so you're around successful people, so you expect success from yourself.

Speaker 1: Now, tell us about some of the sights and sounds and smells growing up, what was it like in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: When you say smells, that--the first thing that comes to my, my mind is that the Intercontinental Bakery [sic, Continental Baking Company] had a Wonder Bread bakery, right next door here.  So, and they would, they would bake for the next day.  So, at night you would smell fresh baked bread they'd been baking all day at six o'clock.  And, that's one of the great memories that I have, the Wonder Bread bakery smell in the air of Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  I grew up on this campus.  I grew, grew up, I literally grew up on Howard's campus.  Most of my friends were centered here.  All of my strong powerful images were here.  Not knowing how powerful they were at the time, I took them for granted, but you know I took for granted that great buildings like Douglass Hall, Founders Library and that great, productive people acted as people act around Howard University's campus.  John Burr, who the gym is named for, taught swimming.  He taught me to swim, he taught my father [Harry Granville Robinson, Jr.] to swim and subsequently, I ended up working with him on Friday nights, teaching swimming at Howard University and I was in junior high school, in high school.  Thought I would be a big swimmer in college, didn't know you had to practice, just wanted to come to the meets and swim, didn't like to practice, didn't do that.  So, the sights and sounds and the memories really go to the activities of Howard University.  The book that I've written captures that spirit that I recall through maps and photographs and drawings and, and, and official documents.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The book is called, 'The Long Walk' ['The Long Walk: The Placemaking Legacy of Howard University'].
Speaker 2: It's called the 'The Long Walk.'
Speaker 1: It was published in--
Speaker 2: It was published in 19--1997 by the Moorland-Spingarn Research Center. We used them as the publisher.  We actually, we actually self-published it.  We published two thousand copies the first time, sold them in six, seven months without a lot of publicity.  And, published another, then around another one thousand in 19--, in 1999, 2000, somewhere around there, and they were in the book store.  They sold for $100.00 a piece, they came in a slip cover.  But, but, let me get back to the university.  Who I am and how I think and how I've been molded really comes from around being at Howard University most of my life.  So, the best and brightest of America come through here every year.  New people came through.  So, the leaders of America now that you think of as leaders, I know.  I know Andy Young [HM Andrew Young] 'cause he was on the swimming team when I was here as a child.  Not that much difference in our age, but he was here while I was maybe in junior high school.  Andy is my senior, by maybe five or six years, which, which would have made that work.  His brother, [HM] Walter Young, came to Howard to dental school [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.]; became a great friend of mine.  My mother [Lucille Gwendolyn Herriford Robinson]--he used to come to my house every day, every Sunday for dinner.  He would go to church with my mother.  And, became--'cause she was at the dental school and became a great friend of his.  So, these people were just my friends, not thinking that they were the leaders, they would become leaders of the free world and the great professors and the great dentists, and doctors and architects and engineers and writers.  Toni Morrison taught me English my first year of college.  She married one of my classmates, [Harold] Harry Morrison, from Jamaica.  So, there's this, this close knit strength of friendship and bonds that one gets from Howard University.  And, those that are memories.  There are memories of being the mascot to the Howard football team and working with the ma- the equipment manager to make sure that all the equipment is back, is clean for the next game and the shoes are shined, and all that, just being involved at that level of the university.

Speaker 1: When I came to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] in '59 [1959], as a freshman, all that I did was start coming to class here because I've been here all my life.  I wasn't searching for--like somebody said, "How do you find, how do you find the chemistry building?"  People from--I, I knew the campus.  So, it was very easy for me to come--I didn't have a problem of adapting to the, the environment.  I just, I just changed from going to high school to going to Howard University.  Just going someplace (unclear) that I knew very well.  And, I mean the flood of names that I see performing who have made the difference in who I, who I am now.  Most of them are centered at Howard University.  Let me tell you this story.  During the summer we were playing on the campus.  My parents [Lucille Gwendolyn Herriford Robinson and Harry Granville Robinson, Jr.]--all the parents were, we had a key to the house and you know, we would swim over at Banneker Recreation Center [Washington, D.C.] or in Howard's pool.  We played on the campus.  There were maybe twenty kids whose parents work on the campus and lived around there and that was my primary group.  And, in the afternoon the Good Humor man would come up 6th Street every day and we had to find a nickel or a dime to get Good Humor.  My aunt, Lil Pugh [ph.], worked with the dean of the [Howard University] School of Social Work [Washington, D.C.], a very small school in Johnson Hall, very small frame building, on the north end of 6th Street.  And, I would normally go by and see "Lil" and get a dime for ice cream and I had my buddies with me, and she'd give them dimes.  Well, this year--this day, we went to Clarence Wheat's father's [Clarence Buchanan "Zack" Wheat, Sr.] office, it was in Miner Hall, one of the older buildings on the east side of campus.  Clarence--Zachary [sic, "Zack" Wheat] was an architect.  And, Clarence says, "Let's go see my father and get some ice cream money."  So, we'd, we'd run across campus or ride our bikes across campus, run up the steps of Miner Hall and go into the architect's office.  Now, Larry, I didn't know what was going on then, but I knew that's what I wanted to do.  I mean, I didn't, you know, I've been to the dentist's office, the doctor's office.  I had a godfather, he was an attorney.  I've been to all kind of professional offices, all manner of work that people could do.  And, I couldn't figure out what an attorney did, 'cause it was just paper, how could you do anything productive with nothing but paper.  It was all over the place--stacks on the floor, bound.  I, I didn't want to do that.  And, you know, who wanted to work in something this size in somebody's mouth for the rest of your life.  I don't know how you make a decision to be a dentist, that's a very difficult profession.  The doctor thing, I didn't find that very appealing.  But, I went into this architect's office and I didn't know what they were doing, but that's what I wanted to do.  Mr. Wheat took time, explained to me what they were doing.  I mean there were bricks on the floor, little models of the buildings.  There were drawings of buildings.  Somebody over here was doing some construction documents.  Somebody was in the corner at a conference table talking to a contractor.  Just the energy of that environment, I said, "This is where I wanted to be."  I wanted to do two other things.  One of them was to be a cowboy, Washington, D.C., very difficult to be a cowboy in the '50s [1950s], very difficult.  My grandmother [Mamie Hill Robinson] used to get the Season Blue (unclear) Catalog [ph.], you know, the big catalog.  And, I used to love to go over and look at it.  They had saddles in there like for $39.00.  I said, "Dad, look, if you just buy me this saddle, I'll find a horse."  He said, "Son, you have to give up this cowboy fantasy, it's not going to happen in Washington, D.C." But, I love the country, I love being out and about.  And, then for a while, because of my respect and love of my Uncle Jim, retired colonel, I wanted, wanted to be a [U.S.] Military officer.  And, I did advanced ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] at Howard University, took a commission and went into the [U.S.] Army for two years.  I really thought about making it a career, went to Vietnam, was a ranger in Vietnam and, and realized the only thing I really liked about the Army was of the training with the troops of the field or be in a war some place and that's about 5 percent of what you do.  And, at some point, I would move away from that.  So, I got hurt in Vietnam and decided that, well the Viet Cong sent me a message, let me not go any further with this, did two years.  All those images, all those imperatives that made me who I am came from Howard University and people around Howard University.
Story_ID: 152455
Speaker 1: My father [Harry Granville Robinson, Jr.] had, my father had friends who had gone to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and stayed in Washington [D.C.].  I mean, a lot of guys came to Howard University and never went home.  That's why we have this great black intelligentsia in Washington, D.C. because of Howard University, and the federal government, easy, easy employment, really clean, respectable employment.  So, my father's friends and mother's [Lucille Gwendolyn Herriford Robinson] friends who'd gone to Howard University and the friends that they made with incoming classes of Howard University; really became my extended family.  And, that's the strength that I have, came from Howard University.  Everything, I have essentially, I owe to this upbringing at Howard University.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 152456
Speaker 1: Now, you went to school, grade school close by--
Speaker 2: James Monroe Elementary School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Georgia Avenue and Columbia Road [Washington, D.C].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went to, and then I went to Banneker.  Banneker Junior High School [later Benjamin Banneker Academic High School, Washington, D.C.] until September, '54 [1954] after Brown v. Board of Education [of Topeka].  And, I showed up the first day, they gave me a school ticket and they said, "You now go to MacFarland [Middle School, Washington, D.C.]."  We had moved to Farragut Street, out of my district, in my--the day that I finished grade school.  And, the first year was '53 [1953] so I went to Banneker, caught the street car back down to Banneker, and, then I went to, went to MacFarland.  One of about the dozen blacks to first go to MacFarland.
Speaker 1: Are they a junior high school?
Speaker 2: Junior high school.  And then I went to Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt [Senior] High School [Washington, D.C.] which is just behind MacFarland.  It was, it was the, the white students were agitated that blacks came to that school for about the first month and they struck, they were on strike for the first couple of days singing songs that weren't very pleasant.  After the first semester, like all children, we were friends.  We were friends, I mean it, it just went away.  There was some lingering, there was some lingering racism among some of the faculty; but the students, we just became friends.  I can't, I can't think of anything that was in the way of our being friends after we got to go to school and talk; and say who we are and who they were and just, it just worked.  It just worked marvelously.
Story_ID: 152457
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a chance to participate in most of the student activities in high school [Theodore Roosevelt Senior High School, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  I--in junior high school [MacFarland Middle School, Washington, D.C.], I played basketball and soccer.  In high school, I played football, I was captain of the rifle team.  I played JV [junior varsity] basketball.  I was big in [J]ROTC [Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps].  As soon as I went to Roosevelt, I joined ROTC, I was big in ROTC.  My platoon as a senior one--in my, in my freshman year, second year and third year, my platoon won the, the drill competition.  I became a distinguished rifleman of the NRA [National Rifle Association], that's the highest junior level that you can have, got free membership in, in NRA until I was twenty-one.  And, it was really like the marksmanship thing.  Had a lot of girlfriends, school was okay.  I wasn't, I wasn't--I didn't study.  I thought studying was boring.  So, in a math class, rather than study the text book, I would create new formulas to get to the same answers.  But, when they want to see the work that causes you a problem with your grade.  So, I was not the great scholar in--in high school. Finished somewhere, the lower third of my class.  Came to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], had something to prove, got straight A's the first semester.  This is how I was going to do this just to prove to myself that I can do this.
Speaker 1: Now, back to high school for a second, were there any teachers at high school that you particularly re-remember? (Simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There was, there was the head of ROTC, his name was Richard Gaius [ph.]. Captain Gaius subsequently became the principal of [Calvin] Coolidge High School [Washington, D.C.].  Because, I was big in ROTC, I had a relationship with Captain Gaius.  He was one of the people, who I think, I tasked myself to, who gave me direction and stability.  And, then there was Joey Kaufman [ph.] who was a football coach, crazy guy; threw a football at your helmet if you didn't do what you were supposed to do.  He'd jump back with the helmet. (Unclear)bBut, it parted a certain discipline and a certain understanding of how you work together as a team.  I think that it's probably that Joe, Joe Kaufman and Richard Gaius.  There was also a gentleman, [George Alonzo] Ferguson, who taught drafting, very modest man, never talked about him--didn't talk about much of anything; sort of a gruff guy.  I'm trying to think of his first name, I can't think of his first name.  But, he taught drafting.  I suddenly learned that he was one of America's first African American architects.  He never told anybody that he was a--that he was a registered architect.  His daughter, Angella Ferguson, was the associate dean of the medical school at Howard University [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] for years [sic, associate vice president for health affairs].  She retired, may be seven, eight years ago.  And, she was always the one who managed the building development process for the medical school.  I--I didn't know that--he was also a colonel in the [U.S.] Army, fought with my uncle in the Second World War in the 366 [Infantry Regiment] (unclear) in--in Italy when he retired.  So, I happened to see his obit in the paper.  He was a--he was a registered architect in Washington, D.C. and a colonel in the Army.  And, I never stopped to look to see what he was bringing to the table that made me attach myself to him.  But, these three people gave me the quality that I was often lacking, which was discipline.  My mind ran a thousand RPMs per second and the ability to sit down and do one thing for a long period of time was just not in my vocabulary.  In grade school, I tested off of the scales.  My father [Harry Granville Robinson, Jr.] would say, "Son, I don't understand these grades.  We know you're smart, we've had you tested. What is it with these grades?"  And, I told--I remember I told him this once, and my uncle, psychiatrist, Charles Wilkinson, married my Aunt Lucy from Kansas City [Missouri].  I said, "Don't worry, daddy, I'm saving my brains until they matter.  I'm not going to use them up on this stuff that does not matter, I'm saving 'em."  When I got my degree from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]--I went down--I remember it was sort of a rainy day, I went down there.  I said, "Daddy, here it is, right here, Harvard University master's degree, your son who didn't do well in junior high school."  He said, "You win."  (Laughter) but, yeah, those three men, I think, made a difference in my life.
Story_ID: 152458
Speaker 1: You had it in your mind when you were a senior in high school [Theodore Roosevelt Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] that you were gonna be an architect, I mean had, had you--
Speaker 2: I changed my mind after I met Zack Wheat [Clarence Buchanan "Zack" Wheat, Sr.], about the fifth grade, I was going to be an architect.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I finished junior high school [MacFarland Junior High School, Washington, D.C.], you know how you have those little, those little school yearbooks that are stapled together, say: "Harry Robinson has just designed a mile high building," which we now know doesn't make sense to design a mile high building.  But, that, that was to be my great achievement.  And the one thing that I attach myself to after some small drafting thing in high school, was Colonel [George Alonzo] Ferguson's course in high school.  Where, from a blank piece of paper and a writing tool, I created something.  I really found great pleasure, it was something that I could stop, that I could start and stop.  Something that I created with some moderate set of rules, but with very little information.  I created this wonderful thing from that.  In fact, in, in high school, I won the science fair for a solar house.  My friend, John Huguley, his father taught chemistry at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], won the--I won the physical side, and he won the biological and his mother taught biology at [Joel Elias] Spingarn High School [Washington, D.C.].  And, John and I are still friends.  He's a doc--he's a retired doctor.  The two of us, the two least likely people to win the science fair, won the school science fair, at a very competitive academic school; and went on to the city and got, and got honorable mentions.  But, that was something that with a little information that I could create and show the people.
Speaker 1: That was in what year, that was in the '50s [1950s], right?
Speaker 2: '50, that was spring of '59 [1959].
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, yeah.  That's remarkable.
Story_ID: 152459
Speaker 1: You already knew about Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  So, it wasn't a cultural shock when you--
Speaker 2: No culture shock.
Speaker 1: At all.
Speaker 2: I just came here.
Speaker 1: Did you have in your mind, like had you already plotted your--what coursework you were going to pursue and who, what teachers you were gonna, whose classes you were going you were gonna be in--(laughter)--
Speaker 2: Well, in architecture, it's a fairly set curriculum.  You don't have a lot of choices and those days, you didn't even pick your design professor.  One professor kept a record so that, during your five years, you would have one, each member of the faculty for de--design so you get that, so you get that broader training (unclear).  What I did do, was to sit down, look at the 151 hours and decide, which was I going to get an A in and which courses I was willing to get a C and D in just to get out of them.  I looked at all those math courses and I said, D or better, 'cause you could have twenty-seven hours of D's, so I plotted where they were going to be.  And, you know, I said, "I'm going to do these, but I just want credit for these courses.  But, I'm going to get these A's, and I, I picked them in my freshman year.  And, amazingly, it came out just about that way. I did really well in my first two semesters.  And, then I discovered the diversions of Howard University, women from around the world.  And, that, but, but that three point from those first two years carried me for that dip.  And, then I got and then I met my wife [Dianne Robinson] and got serious about life and it went back up to the--but there was a big dip in the center. But always great grades in, in design, always great grades in design.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 152460
Speaker 1: Well, who were some of the architectural professors that you had here, at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] that--
Speaker 2: The best, they were the best, Howard Mackey, came to Howard University in 1923 out of the University of Pennsylvania.  He'd gone to school there. (Unclear) at Howard, Dean Mackey was from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And, one of his great qualities was that he could, that he could see something in his students before they knew it was there.  And, he knew that I was not this frivolous kid who spent a lot of time doing nonsense and getting great grades; great grades or not so great grades.  And, I used to say that he knew I was in cherry tree before I had bark that looked like a cherry, certainly I didn't have any flowers that look like cherry flowers and no fruit.  And, Howard Mackey and these guys carried us through those difficult periods.  Howard Mackey and Frank West, Frank West was from St. Louis, Missouri and was the friend of my mother's [Lucille Gwendolyn Herriford Robinson], Arthur Turner, who she knew from St. Louis, who was her contemporary.  And, he and Arthur Turner lived together in Mayfair Mansion [Washington, D.C.] that was done by Albert Cassell, another great African American architect, and--out, out of northeast.  And, I met Frank just in generally.  Because, normally, I'd get in the car with my father [Harry Granville Robinson, Jr.] and we'd go visit people, we'd go visit his friends.  And, Frank, Frank was one of the first architects--he was my first design professor, it was a design that was due the Monday at five o'clock after Homecoming Weekend and my first Homecoming Weekend.  Well, wasn't that a mess.  I didn't start doing it until Sunday afternoon.  And, I came in that day was rubbing my hands and Frank came in and said, "Robinson, what is this, what is this, let me show you how to do this." And, Frank and I got to be great friends.  When I became dean, Frank was my third associate dean un--until he passed; but, was a great man, a great thinker, scholar, knew all the Edgar Guest poetry, by heart; was a scholar on the Bible and the Civil War.  Nobody ever knew this, because he was, he was sort of a rough, tough kind of guy; but was a great, great architect.  He designed all his mechanical systems, designed all his structures, he, he didn't need any engineers.  Frank did the whole building; he was a great designer.   There, there were many of those, Lee--there was Leroy John Henry Brown, who taught descriptive geometry, one of the first courses.  This man had an, an ability to draw.  We'd come to class and he'd be at the blackboard.  He'd have different color chalks between his fingers.  And, he's drawing these diagrams with his one finger in space, (unclear) better than the computer can draw them.  So, there was that quality of faculty we had.  And, Kerman Keith [ph.] was--would have been the first African American to get a Ph.D., he died in the spring of '70 [1970] (unclear).  Keith taught theory and art criticism and was a bon vivant, a good designer and quite a guy.  But, the entire faculty were these, were these very large men, men who are larger than life, in my view then that that made it very easy to succumb to what they wanted to teach in.  Louis Fry taught structures, Louis Fry, has a--his grandson is an architect so there's one of those families that has three generations of--of architects in them.  Louis Fry worked with Walter Gropius, went to school (cough) at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in the '40s [1940s] with Walter Gropius after Walter Gropius left Germany during the Second World War [WWII] and came here to teach.  Louis Fry, was, once again, one of these very modest men who spoke very quietly, and wasn't self-promoting.  The year that the AIA [American Institute of Architects] did not give the Gold Medal for Design is because Louis Fry tied I.M. Pei and they couldn't break the tie, so they didn't give it that year.  He would have been the first person, the first African American to get the, the AIA Gold Medal for Design.  We had Louis Fry, and Leon Brown.  We called him white Brown--we had two Browns, we had a white Brown, Aljed, [ph.] and a Leon Brown and a black Brown, Aljed Brown [Leroy John Henry Brown] and Leon Brown was married into money.  He was from South Carolina, very lucrative Jewish family; father was a big Jewish Democrat in the South.  And, Leon taught interior design and design, was president of the Washington AIA and hired the first black architect to work for a white firm in this town, and his name was Ted Golder [ph.].  And, Ted Golder had been in school with Frank West, Leon Brown hired him in his firm, Brown & Wright [Architects].  So, throughout, there's this is history that was being made there that I didn't know until I--some years later, when I started looking at the history of African American architects.  But these were giants of men in their times, just giants of men.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 152461
Speaker 1: What were you the most interested in doing, designing buildings or--
Speaker 2: Designing buildings.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Design build--I thought I was a designer, I mean--you know Howard University [Washington, D.C.] had the reputation of creating young architects that could leave here after five years, go to somebody's office and sit down and become a profit center.  You can do construction documents, you know, where you make your money is in this construction documents piece.  We can do that (unclear).  I won the [American Institute of Architects] Gold Medal in 1965.  I had ne--I had no interest in doing construction documents.  I wanted to be a designer.  And, and the notion that you could be a designer out of Howard in some of these large white firms in town was just not so much even thought about.  But, that's all that I did, I mean--I set myself up to do that.  Guys would say, "Harry, you, you do know how to put these buildings together."  I said, "I'll hire you to put them together.  I have an idea of how to put them together, but I'll hire you to put them together.  I'm going to design these buildings."  And most of these guys went that way, while I went the other way.  And, they thought it was taking a risk with my career.  But, I've had a--quite an enjoyable and fruitful career in doing that.
Story_ID: 152462
Speaker 1: When you graduated [from Howard University, Washington, D.C.] did you--did your D's like pull you down, you know, in terms of, in terms of--
Speaker 2: No, no.  I graduated in '66 [1966].  I stayed off a year after I got married.  I had some incompletes I had to clean up.  And, then I--since I had been in ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps], I got a career and went in the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, one of the things I tell my students now is that this architectural degree has been useful to me in every phase to my life.  I mean the ability to plan and to visualize and then design a response to a given situation is ubiquitous in the world.  So, I use these, these talents everywhere I went.  I would use it at ranger school, to plan, to plan raids, ambushes.  You put little models of sticks and trees and then I had a certain visual of those--that, that the rest of these guys didn't have.  So, this, this degree, this ability has handled me--has kept me very well.  Went to Vietnam, I was up on the Cambodian border, I was wounded, spent seven months at Walter Reed [National Military Medical Center, Washington, D.C.], recuperating.  Got--and then I worked in the senior engineer office for about four months.  Came back to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], it was '68 [1968].  [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] had been assassinated, the cities were in turmoil.  And, I came back to Howard University in city planning.
Story_ID: 152463
Speaker 1: Now, I want to go back to Vietnam for a minute and just discuss that because that--you mentioned earlier, one of your favorites--favorite places to visit is Ho Chi Minh City [Vietnam]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --the former Saigon [Vietnam].  Did you spend a lot of time in Saigon when you were there?
Speaker 2: No, I actually came through Saigon for maybe a day and a half.  And then I went to my base camp up in Dĩ An [Vietnam], which wasn't very far away.  And, then I was assigned to a place called Kon Voi [Vietnam] on the Cambodian border.  But, I went back to Saigon first in '99 [1999] as an advance party for a delegation that was coming in April.  I probably been back four times since then.  I just find it a very, a very gentle and sophisticated city.  People are friendly, the war never happened as far as they're concerned.  There's vitality, there's great food, they're nice people, like to do and hang out and see; that's, that's sort of how I came to that answer.  Now, that's, that's obviously not the best favorite place of my family.  They like to go to the beaches.  We went to the Bahamas, we all went to the Bahamas in August.  They like Hilton Head [South Carolina].  But just to knock around on my own, that's something I enjoy doing.
Story_ID: 152464
Speaker 1: You came back from Vietnam in '66 [1966]?  Was it?  No, '68 [1968].  Right?
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968], yeah.  Actually, actually came back offshore on July 4, 1967 [1967], and I came back here [Washington, D.C.] about ten days later.  They kept me there for a period of time to stabilize me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, and you had been in combat, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, okay.  So, they figured you needed some time to readjust or something?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd had a fractured femur and I, and every night I would get--run these high fevers, and they couldn't figure out what they were about.  So, until they got that stabilized, they, they kept me in the hospital at alarm injunction [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, you got back here, what, '67 [1967], right?
Speaker 2: Summer of '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mid-July.
Speaker 1: All right.

Speaker 1: So, you were here, you know, leading up to the time that [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was killed.
Speaker 2: I was, yeah.
Speaker 1: What did you do when you came back?
Speaker 2: I was in traction at Walter Reed [Army] Hospital [later, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Washington, D.C.] from, about mid-July sometime, until January of '68 [1968]; not--that's not true.  I was in traction until mid-October.  Then they put me in a full body cast and allowed me to go home.  I come back every thirty days and they check me--x-ray me.  So, I was in, I was in that cast for probably three months.  And, then I was on crutches until March when I--then had to go back to duty.  And, I was--I went to the senior engineer's office at Walter Reed.  Colonel Quigley [ph.] was the dentist and engineer, Rory Rashkle [ph.], colonel (unclear).  I said, "I wanna see Colonel Quigley."  He says, "Well, what do you want lieutenant?"  I said, "I wanna, be stationed here."  He said, "Just a moment."  So, she went in and I heard her say, "Lieutenant Robinson"--"who the hell is Lieutenant Robison?  What does he want?  Send him in here."  "Colonel Quigley, I'm an architect.  I live--my parents [Lucille Gwendolyn Herriford Robinson and Harry Granville Robinson, Jr.] live four blocks from here and I wanna be stationed here until I get out in September."  He said, "Don't worry about it Robinson.  You walk over to personnel, by the time you get over there, I'll catch your papers to be stationed here."  'Cause they wanted me to go down to Fort Belvoir [Fort Belvoir, Virginia] and teach ranger tactics and demolitions, which I was perfectly capable of doing.  But, that part of my life had passed, and I wasn't, I wasn't really mobile like I should have been.  So, I got stationed at Walter Reed for the rest of my--which let me do physical therapy every morning before I went to work.  And then, Dr. King was assassinated and I made the decision that I would go to grad school.  So, the following fall, I went to grad school, and took a job with the D.C. [District of Columbia] Redevelopment Land Agency [RLA] here in Washington [D.C.].  It was--because we didn't--then didn't have home rule, it was a federal redevelopment agency.  And, worked for them in the shore field office as an architect planner; went to grad school and started a firm.  And, I would go to meetings and people would say, "Well, which hat are you wearing, Harry?"  Because I, you know, I was a student and I had a firm, worked for four or five development corporations, here in town; worked for RLA.  So, I had, had a hat with bills that I would just turn around that had a symbol on the front.  And it was a great time.  It was a heady time for me in my career.  I was in grad school here, doing a lot of things.
Story_ID: 152466
Speaker 1: And, did that, and then came--beginning of my second year of a two year program decided that I wanted to go to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And, sent an application off to Harvard in January of '70 [1970].  Early, it was due like the second week of January of '70 [1970].  And, in April of '70 [1970], I got a notice that I had been admitted to Harvard University.  Although my father [Harry Granville Robinson, Jr.] saying, "And, this is my son, who in junior high school, didn't do anything."  That was, you know, right there with me.  And, by this time, I had two children, wife didn't work, had no idea how I was gonna go to Harvard University.  I was disabled.  So, I went down to the Washington VA [Veterans Affairs] office.  And, I asked, I said, "Hi, I'm Harry Robinson.  I'm 60 percent disabled.  I want vocational rehabilitation."  (Unclear) "Mr. Robinson, we can't qualify you for that."  "Okay."  So, I was intent on going to Harvard.  Didn't wanna take my family, 'cause I wanted to do a two year program in one year.  I wouldn't have time to be a father and a husband.  So, we had a great apartment in Washington [D.C.].  My family was here, they could take care of them.  So, I figure that there must be a way for an employee of the federal government to be able to go to grad school for advanced study and have them pay for it.  I walked down to the Civil Service, which was then down on--by the AA on New York Avenue, across from Roland Park.  I go to the information desk and say, "Hi, can you tell me where I would find information on the rights of a federal employee to go to grad school and have it paid by the federal government?"  "Well, yes, sir.  See you go, someone say so to, go to this volume, this library and it's probably on this page."  And, I went in it.  I found this rule that says that, any federal employment--employee can go for advanced study if only the head of the agency saying that it's okay to do it.  Doesn't require any paperwork, because that year, you're just working at Harvard, rather than working at D.C. RLA [District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency].  So, I wrote this letter to head of RLA and there was then Melvin Mister.  And, through him, it was a great consternation, because he didn't know what to do with it.  So, he called a meeting of his board.  A friend of Charlie (unclear) was on the board.  They said, "Well,"--he said, "well, what are we gonna do?"  "We'll send him to Harvard."  He says, "But, he's the only one."  He said, "Well, he's the only one that ever asked."  "Because he's the only one that ever had enough sense to ask you for this, you shouldn't say no."  So, this was all happening while I was on a fellowship in Sweden.  Came back and they still hadn't decided.  But, it looked pretty good.  So, I packed my car.  I go to Harvard.  No place to live, none of that.  I just go to Cambridge [Massachusetts].  And while I--the day I was there, one, one of the heads of agencies, one of the head of the divisions called my wife and said, "You can pick up Harry's check every two weeks."  So, they were taken care of.  So, they lived off of my federal government check. I lived off the GI Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] and consulting money in Cambridge.  But, then there was a matter of paying Harvard's tuition.  'Cause mind you, I had GI Bill, but I didn't have vocation rehabilitation.  The same Clarence Wheat [Clarence Buchanan "Zack" Wheat, Sr.], had been my friend here at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] was there getting a degree in architecture.  And, a friend of his was in charge of financial aid, a young woman.  Takes me over and says, "This is my friend, Harry Robinson, we grew up together.  He needs tuition."  The woman says, "Well, can--you wanna check now or can you come back tomorrow morning and get it?"  I said, "I'll come back tomorrow morning and get it."  Took care of Harvard's tuition.  So, now I have my family taken care of.  I got income from some consultant contracts.  I got Harvard's tuition covered and I have the GI Bill to live off of; worked for me.  Somewhere along about mid-October, rainy and snowy and cold in Boston [Massachusetts].  I'm watching the morning news at 7 o'clock, and veterans are down at the JFK Center Federal Building [John F. Kennedy Federal Building, Boston, Massachusetts] protesting not getting their benefits.  I think, let me try this vocation rehabilitation thing again.  So, I get up, put on my jungle fatigues, and I walk down, "Right on brother, Right on."  I walk through the crowd, go upstairs.  And, they says, "What do you want?"  I said, "My name is Harry Robinson, I wanna go to grad school, I want to apply forvocation rehabilitation."  She said, "Oh, what is your disability?"  I said, "It's 60 percent."  She said, "And, where do you wanna go to grad school?"  I said, "I'm a student at Harvard University."  They sat me down.  They gave me a battery of tests.  Two hours later, I walk out of there and I have vocation rehabilitation; which now means, that they pay Harvard's tuition; all fees, all books, and all equipment.  I took about a forty dollar hit on my GI Bill.  But, now the tuition thing is handled.  And, that's, that's how I went through, that's how I went through Harvard University.  The GI Bill thing kick on when my--they had my file transferred from Washington up there, and the file was transferred back to Washington.  There is no mention in this file of my ever having vocation rehabilitation.  I don't know what that's about.  Maybe it was, it was divine intervention, which I truly believe that it was.  But, there once again, I saw opportunity and took advantage of opportunity when other people might not have taken advantage of opportunity.  And, I finished Harvard's urban design program which was two years, I finished all the coursework and the two senior studios in one year.  And, I came back and registered for another year, and I did independent studies project.  And, I got my degree after that year.
Speaker 2: Awesome, that's really ama--how you planned this financial arrangement was really--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, you know, there's divine intervention in my life.  I believe that.  I believe that none of this--that I didn't make any of this happen.  I just followed the path that had been set out for me.
Story_ID: 152467
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know, it seems like--yeah, seem--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Same thing in Vietnam. When I got hurt in Vietnam, I broke the largest bone in my body on a road in Viet Cong territory.  And, it was enough of an injury where I couldn't stay there that I had to come home.  I mean, I volunteered to go to Vietnam.  It was something that I had to do.  It was, it was something that I had to go and experience this war thing.  It was something that would make me whole.  And, I break this largest bone in my body, was like the divine spirit says, "Okay, you beg me to come here.  I let you come here.  And, now you're getting reckless.  It's time for you to go home."  And, that happened 4th of July, eleven o'clock in the morning.  Ten days later, I'm on a plane coming back to this country.
Speaker 1: How long did you stay there all together?
Speaker 2: Three months, twenty-two days and eight hours.
Speaker 1: So, you know exactly (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I kept a log.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: I kept a log.
Story_ID: 152468
Speaker 1: But, I think on a lot of these, well, a lot of these things that you say are, are, well, you know, who can say about the intervention but, you've seemed to have planned things fairly, I mean, you seem to know what you're doing.
Speaker 2: People--all my friends and my colleagues say, "You're the luckiest person that we know."  Well, let me tell you about luck.  Luck is preparation meeting opportunity.  And, I--I placed myself where opportunity can happen after preparing to take advantage of it. But, when I look back at my life, clearly I had been placed in situations that brought me to where I am now.  Clearly, it just didn't happen.  I know that it just didn't happen.  You know, and I've left at the--I've come at the time.  I don't stay to long at the party.  When the party's over, I go to the next thing.  I have, I have never had a plan for my life, never.  I do things that place me in a position to be able to go to the next one.  And, wherever the next one is, I have no idea what it is.  I have an idea what my next big assignment is gonna be.  It's gonna be the, the executive architect project manager for the new African-American Museum [National Museum of African American History and Culture, Washington, D.C.] on the Mall.  The Smithsonian is looking for people to do that.  The past month, I've been places where people have said, "Harry, you know, you need to go and do that."  I met a young woman who's in the General Counsel Office of the Smithsonian [Office of General Counsel Smithsonian].  I was in line with her buying some African artifacts that were left from the Molly exhibit last, last August, for black festival.  We started talking.  She said, "Mr. Robinson, I know you, you're at Harvard University."  Says, "You know, I was just in a meeting yesterday, and I wish I thought of your name, because you're the perfect person to do this."  And, it keeps coming up.  So, people are talking about it, and that's, that's gonna be my next, that's gonna be my next big thing.  You're nice to people, you're prepared, and opportunity comes your way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 152469
Speaker 1: Tell us about Harvard [University Graduate School of Design, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  Who was at Harvard?  What--who, who were some of your teachers at Harvard?  And, what did you learn at Harvard?
Speaker 2: The real value of Harvard, but, but the value, the value is twofold.  First of all, you meet really bright students, who're your contemporaries, where you can reach back on in the future for relationships.  The next value of Harvard is the de--the degree, the degree. I mean, the fact they're occupied with whatever else they're doing.  You--that's, that's how it was when I was there.  Teaching assistants carried many of the courses.  I went down--I mean, I actually had set up a curriculum that I wanted to take when I went to Harvard.  Many of those courses weren't offered because the faculty were on leave, or weren't teaching that semester.  So, I had to scramble and put together this new (unclear).  But, the real value was the friends that I made at Harvard that I now can call on, and I'm involved with in doing projects.  It's a, it can take a toll on someone to have enough ego strength to get through it.  It's a brutal place.  Everybody's really smart.  And, everybody likes being smart.  And, likes exerting their intellect.  So, you have to have a certain ego strength to handle that.  I was just out of Vietnam, I mean, after that I didn't fear anything.  I mean, once you've been to war, you either fear everything, or you don't fear anything.  I didn't (laughter), I didn't fear anything.  I mean, nothing could have been as bad as that.  Nobody there was gonna kill me.  Nobody there was trying to kill me.  Short of that, I can, I can deal with all of it.  Willem Von Markey [ph.] was the director of the urban design program there.  And, was somewhat involved--he was sorta on retirement, (cough) but somewhat involved.  But, I met David Lee who, young black man has a firm in Boston [Massachusetts] now; great friend of mine.  And, I met, I met friends that I still have there.  And, I've had the Harvard experience, which is the value of it.  And, of course, the Harvard degree.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the credential of it and, you know--
Speaker 2: Credential, yeah.
Speaker 1: And being able to say you went--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Sure.
Speaker 1: Went to Harvard.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 152470
Speaker 1: Well, what did you do next?
Speaker 2: Good story.  Sometime in May, it was coming toward the end of the semester, and there's a bar in Cambridge [Massachusetts] called Casablanca, where they play the movie 'Casablanca' all the time, it's underground.  I used to walk through this tunnel to get to it.  I'm sitting there having a drink with a friend of mine, I see this black guy come in, he has on a suit and tie.  And, I said, "I know, he's not a Harvard student," because none of us dress like that.  So, I invited him to come and sit with us.  He told me his name was [William] Bill Riley, and he was at a--at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] to find some people to come teach at Morgan State Uni- at Morgan State University [Baltimore, Maryland]'s new urban planning program, okay.  I didn't (unclear).  We had a couple--and so he said, "Do you know David?"  I said, "Sure, I know David Lee."  Well, he and David were friends.  So, we go and find David; go out with David and his new girlfriend, to dinner.  And, then now it's eight o'clock and this guy, I'm taking him to the airport [Logan International Aiport].  I had, had a car in Boston [Massachusetts].  And, he said, "By the way, Harry, what are you doing at Harvard?"  I said, "I'm studying urban design and city planning."  "Oh, you need to come to Morgan.  Man, this is made for you.  We need you at Morgan, you're the perfect person."  I said, "Let me tell you something, I'm going back to Washington, D.C.  I work for Rita Valemonte [ph.] in D.C.  I'm gonna start my firm.  In two years, I'm gonna have my firm going."  He said, "Naw man, you need to come to Morgan, come to Morgan.  I said, "Naw, naw, naw, naw, I'm not," take him to the airport.  I don't talk to him anymore.  I come home sometime in early June.  I get a phone call from this guy, Homer Favor.  He said, "Harry Robinson?"  "Yes."  "This Homer Favor."  "Dr. Favor, how are you doing?"  He says, "I'm at Morgan State University, and you met my colleague, Bill Riley when you were at Harvard."  I said, "Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure."  "I'd like for you to come talk to me about, about teaching at Morgan."  I said, "Dr. Favor, I told Bill Riley that I'm committed to Washington, D.C."  He says, "Well, come talk to me."  I said, "Well, you know, Dr. Favor."  He said, "Why don't we have lunch?"  He said, "Oh, by the way, I know your Uncle Charlie Wilkerson.  I'm on the NIMH panel with him.  And, I've already talked to him, and you can call him and he'll tell you about me."  So, I called Charlie.  I said, "Uncle Charlie, who is Dr. Favor?"  He said, "Well, he's got something going.  Well, you ought to go talk to him."  So, I did.  And, I taught at Morgan full-time and worked for RLA [Redevelopment Land Agency] full-time for a year.  That was '71 [1971].  End of '72 [1972], I left RLA and went to Morgan to head that program.  Somewhere around 1975, [1975] Andrew Billingsley, [HistoryMaker] Amy [Tate Billingsley]'s former husband, was the president.  I'd known Andy previously, he was a neighbor of mine.  And, my Uncle Jim, Colonel Robinson had been Andy's executive assistant when he was vice president a year at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  Andy Billingsley said, "Harry, would you start a school of architecture?"  I said, "Let me give that some thought."  I said, "Why don't we think about something a little deeper than that."  He said, "So, give me a proposal."  So, I proposed to him that we start a school of built environment studies, the current city planning program, landscape architecture, urban design, and architecture, all at the graduate level.  Because I know that Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island] had the undergraduate program and they could stop us there.  So, I said, "We're gonna move beyond that.  We're gonna do a three and a half year program.  We're gonna strategize this."  So, I did that.  And, Homer Favor and I shepherd it through all the state systems.  Had it approved by the state, had Ford Foundation money.  I had funds for Improvement Post-Secondary Education [Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education] money.  And, hired the entire faculty at one time.  (Unclear) I hired all the faculty.  Put together and made it (unclear) this many senior people.  Everybody has to be able to do at least two of 'em.  Either you got to be an architect planner or landscape architect urban design.  You had to do--be able to teach across this curriculum.  I said, I need this many white people.  I need this many black people.  And, I went, I set it up; finding them and I hired them all.  Recruited the first class, and then, and then Howard came up.  Howard's dean left, and the students at Howard came to me and asked if I had interest in being the dean.  So, I talked to him about it.  Met with them on several occasions; I was interviewed by the vice president Lorraine Williams, summer of '79 [1979].  Waited for another month and a half, didn't hear anything.  [HistoryMaker] President [James] Cheek had broken his foot.  The elevator in the A Building was broken and he couldn't walk up the steps.  So, he couldn't come to work.  One day, his secretary, Mrs. Tucker, called and said, "Mr. Robinson, this is Mrs. Tucker."  I said, "How are you?  Good to hear from you."  She says, "President Cheek wants to meet with you," and my response, Larry, was, "what about?"  (Laughter) I mean, she caught me so off guard.  She said, "Why don't come meet with him?"  And, he offered me the job, and I left Morgan and came to Howard in September 5, 1979.  I was dean for fifteen years (telephone ringing).  James Cheek was president asked me to be the vice president for, for (telephone ringing) academic affairs, a job I had no interest in.  He convinced me over a long six hour conversation that, in fact that I should do this, and I did.  I was administrative vice president for two years and vice president of academic affairs for two years.  I woke up one morning and decided that I don't wanna do that anymore, that I was really an architect.  What I've done many architectural things, and I'd written this book and I'd fixed the campus and I restored the first president's house.  I've did everything that I wanted to do.  There is now time for me to go back to what I wanted to do, to be an architect.  I was on sabbatical for two years at full pay.  I came back here, to the faculty.
Story_ID: 152471
Speaker 1: And--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: What did you do on sabbatical? Did you--
Speaker 1: Went to Vietnam, played golf. (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: Actually, I went to work for the U.N [United Nations].  I was chairman of one of the international commissions, on the Goree [Island] memorial in Dakar, Senegal.
Speaker 2: Goree, that's the island that was used to ship slaves on?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And, I--they sent me around the world promoting that and working on the development plan of how to get it built.  Then, I came back here after a year, and the dean was--now the interim dean was a friend of mine.  He says, "Take another year.  Just come here every once a while."  So, that's what I did.  And, I taught myself how to play golf.  And, worked for the U.N. and did some other projects.  And, then, and I was talking to my co-author on the book, I was talking to her over the weekend; the books is not closed yet on whether or not my time as vice president was as valuable as would have been my time being dean.  I don't, I don't know quite what that is yet.  But, I did a lot of things that had not been done at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  And, for that, I love that opportunity.  But, there I was sitting with great moral authority in the university with a new president coming in, who understood that he needed me to transition him into this university; which is, which is what I did for him.  I had a great time doing that.  Writing the book ['The Long Walk: The Placemaking Legacy of Howard University'], doing a history of Howard University is, is momentous.  I mean, it's--so from that standpoint, I'm--I greatly appreciate having been given that opportunity.
Speaker 2: Did you have help from the history department?   Doing that, or?
Speaker 1: No.  It was in my head.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I mean, it's a book that I wanted to write a long time ago.  And, when I became vice president (unclear), I had a three million dollar discretionary budget.  I took a weekend and wrote a fifteen to twenty page outline.  Hazel Edwards had been a student of mine who was doing some consultant work that she didn't enjoy.  I said, "Hazel, look come work for me.  Here's an outline.  I go away for two weeks, come read it and come back."  She said, "I loved this."  She said, "Okay."  "I have all the money you need.  Let's organize and get this book written."  And, that's how we did that.  We hired a lot of researchers to go and find stuff.  I knew where everything--the outline said, in this chapter, you can find these documents in this place.  So, it was really, it was really a roadmap of how to get that book written.  In those days I did two master plans.  Howard University 20/20, which I'm really proud of.  And, fixed the campus, brought the campus back to where it should be.  But, it came a time when, I'd done enough.  It was time for me to come back home.
Story_ID: 152472
Speaker 1: In terms of the campus, there's, you know, Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], the last few years have been undergoing some changes, I guess, in terms of the neighborhood changing and some of the, I know people I know who went to school here have come back and just, they're almost lost sometimes, you know, and some things are closed that used to be opened and some, you know, vice versa, so--
Speaker 2: The, the, president [HistoryMaker H. Patrick Swygert] is a, is a builder.  He's, he's made great moves to fix the environment in which we live.  For example, when, when the Howard University hotel closed in September of '95 [1995], it was in my portfolio, I turned it into the Howard Center.  And, we used it as a shuttle space as we did facilities, we put people in them.  But, it is now the Howard Center.  It has, has some major activities in there.
Speaker 1: Used to be the Howard Inn, they called it the Howard Inn.
Speaker 2: It was the Howard Inn.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But, it was actually the Howard Hotel--the Howard Inn then became the Howard Inn, and before that it was Ed Murphy called it, it was Harambee House [Harambee House Hotel] House.  It was called the Harambee House.  A black guy bought that hotel, using commerce money.  And, they had plans to put the bookstore on the second floor, where, where ISES [ph.] is now, Information Systems, (cough) pardon me, and the iLab.  I convinced the trustees to put the bookstore on the ground floor of that and that's our, that's our retail gesture to Georgia Avenue.  So, it is Howard's department store now.  People see it and they go in and buy things and don't have to go look for it--okay, yeah--(laughter) which is very exciting.  So, you know, I could name about eight or nine things that I'm really proud of that I did while I was vice president, which is one of them.  Now, the president is gonna, is gonna build the Howard Town Center across the street.  Housing, retail, a couple new school buildings, a middle school on math and science as a feeder for the university.  Really wonderful ideas that we have a developer, Michelle Higgins, a Howard alumnus is a developer.  And that's, that's all ongoing now.  And, as that happens, you're gonna find that Georgia Avenue is gonna change gradually.  I'm on a team to develop (unclear) worth property up in New Hampshire [Avenue] and Georgia.  And, there four other major prospects up on Georgia Avenue that I work on.  One other things in my portfolio was LeDroit Park, thirty-seven vacant properties.  I couldn't keep 'em boarded up.  The crack guys just tore 'em up.  Of course, I told, (unclear), "This is the ghettoest park in the world.  Let's put together a package where, where we sell them to our faculty and our staff."  And, so we put that up as their equity and they wouldn't have to pay to have them done over.  It was a great deal for people who bought that stuff.  Great, great--they may have paid a hundred and two thousand, now they're worth four hundred thousand dollars now.  So, we, we solidified and restored the southern boundary of the university, and changed that whole area down there--is now, is now a hot area to buy properties.  So, I mean, the president understands how to do that.  When Peoples Involvement Corporation went out of business, he bought all their properties along Georgia Avenue.  He bought the Burger King up here that's now, that's now a National Car Rental.  So, that faculty and students have a place to rent cars.  He bought the old P--Piece (unclear) there on Florida [Avenue] on 7th [Street] and Georgia.  It's now a CVS.  CVS is gonna go through the New Town Center, and something else is gonna go there.  So, he understands restoring the environment which you do, in which the educational enterprise occurs.  Before that nobody had any respect for the campus, place looked like crap.  And, over a period of two years, we did ten years' worth of work of putting this place back to where it was.  And for that, I'm very proud of that.

Speaker 1: And, Larry, in all this, I have a family.  I got married in '65 [1965].  I was still in school.  When I won the gold medal [from the American Institute of Architects] in '65 [1965], a week later, my first daughter was born.  I have three daughters.  They're all great kids.  They've all done very well.  And, their mother made them that way, made them--while I was off doing all of this, she was home taking care of them and teaching them to be the young women that, that they are.  So now, you don't have to work.  I just--I, I always did five or six different things.  So, she stayed at home and took care of house and home; was always there when they came home.  Didn't--she went back to school when Kia was maybe in the fifth grade.  My mother [Lucille Gwendolyn Herriford Robinson] was alive.  She went back to school and finished Howard's [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] summa cum laude, and does, and does TV broadcast now.  She's worked for a bunch of people.  She works for, for MSNBC now as a, as a producer.  So, I had these great kids and this great family, this great-grandson.  I have this grandson named after me.  His name is Harry Winlike [ph.].  He lives in California; calls me every day.  So, life is really good.  And, it all goes back to values that I learned from my family and from Howard University.

Speaker 1: Tell me about--I just wanna ask you about--I know in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s] people starting about a black aesthetic and even affected black poets, writers, painters, sculptures and architects as well, and, people started to discuss more African looking and more not just African looking, but--
Speaker 2: Culturally sensitive art.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.  The forms that were more easily socialized people around whatever function they were engaged in.  What is your philosophy about that?
Speaker 2: Architecture is always in a search for its place in society.  You know, we had the post-modernists movement where they came out of the Bauhaus in Germany, the modernist movement, when no matter where you were, you could take this building and you could put it in and it would fit.  So, it was an international architecture.  You find them Cairo [Egypt]. You find them in Swaziland.  You find them in New York City [New York].  It was international no matter where you were; very upscale, not much detail.  You're from--you know Chicago [Illinois], [Ludwig] Mies van der Rohe--
Speaker 1: And steel.  Black steel and glass (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) International architecture.  Somewhere in the mid to late '60s [1960s], there was an awakening of the notion of an Africentric [ph.] architect.  And, I say Africentric, not Afrocentric, because Euro is Euro, we should be African if we're gonna be Africentric.  And, there were movement among students and some professionals to try to begin to create this African, African American aesthetic in architecture.  I always thought that it had to do with how one lived and how you configure interior places for people to undertake activities.  And, I go back to my grandmother [Mamie Hill Robinson] who sat in the kitchen, had a porcelain kitchen table in her late years and listened to the radio, listened to the soap operas.  So, the kitchen had--was always the focus of my home.  People came to my home, they sat in my kitchen.  The food was there.  I had a living room sofa nobody ever sat on it unless I had a large party.  Everybody came--we'd have thirty people in the kitchen, you know.  The wines there.  The liquors there.  The food's there.  You drop stuff, it's okay.  And, it sorta became the eating, drinking, socializing really had to happen in the kitchen.  And, then we built a deck and it happened there sometimes.  But, that was off the kitchen, and people came back, people came back into the kitchen.  Pierre Goudiaby Atepa is an architect in Senegal, in Dakar, Senegal, and Pierre is known for doing very large structures with the African motif.  In other words, he takes the notion of a mother and child and did the African Development Bank in, in that format.  He did--he's an Africentric high rise building.  His office is Africentric (ph.).  It's Egyptian, it's round.  It's on pendentives and it has African symbolism on it.  Peter (unclear) was the only private African architect in South Africa during apartheid.  And, a lot of Peter's work was Africentric with Zulu and Endelig [ph.] prints and patterns on facades with traditional African courtyards used as play yards around which schools would configure themselves as classrooms.  So, I think that it is as much a visual statement as it is how you organize places for people to live and work and be educated.  Jack Travis out of New York City, I think is probably the leading African American architect now who is dedicated his career to Africentricity.   So, a lot of really great, great interiors that are Africentric.  He's done a black bank that has Africentric motif in it and it's, I mean, Jack is a great designer.  He's an elegant designer.  So, this isn't some mishmash of applique.  It is thoughtful use of African patterns and African symbolism in architecture.  I've done some of that.  Most of it has to do with using African artifacts and interiors that are really simple, plain backgrounds for this wonderful African art, artifacts that are collected over the years.  So, I think that, unlike music and dance and art and theatre, which, which can be produced without a client, the architecture is a capital intensive profession.  You need a client to do that.  So, you need a client who wants that done.  Jack has done it for Spike Lee, Spike Lee's house in Brooklyn [New York, New York].  He did a house with Wesley Snipes that is really an elegant house in Florida.  So, a lot of private homes--Jack's own home is elegantly African, Africentric.  But, short of Michael Jordan, Isiah Thomas, and Kobe [Bryant] and Shaq [Shaquille O'Neal] and everyone else you could think that has money coming together and wanting to make that kind of capital investment some place, in Africentrism, you're gonna get the smaller projects that do that.  And, it's a personal taste that people have, I believe.  And, Jack Travis does it very, very well.

Speaker 1: I just thought a few minutes ago when you said you attended Benjamin Banneker [Junior High] School [later Benjamin Banneker Academic High School, Washington, D.C.] that--you know, [Benjamin] Banneker was actually an architect, a black architect here in the city [Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 2: (Shaking head) Larry, let me tell you the true story.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: That's a myth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Every time I see this myth, I have to correct it. I was sitting in my office when I was dean one night, it was nine o'clock and the phone rang and I answered.  And, this guy identified himself as the father of a young guy who was at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] getting a master's degree in planning.  He was incensed that the white faculty had told this kid that his thesis that Benjamin Banneker designed the City of Washington [D.C.] wasn't true.  And, he wanted me to call them up and correct them.  The fact of the matter, that's not the story.  In 1791, [1791] George Ellicott had come from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], had been retained by President [George] Washington, to lay out--to survey the City of Washington.  He rode, he rode from Philadelphia to what is now Ellicott City in Maryland, to meet with his cousin, Andrew Ellicott to ask him to come help him to lay this City of Washington out.  And, he says, "I'm really busy," you know.  It's crop time.  I gotta take care of my farm.  But, I know a free born Negro who can help you.  His name is Benjamin Banneker.  And, he met Benjamin Banneker and the two of them rode down what is now Route 29 Old Columbia Pike to Washington, D.C.  For a period of about two months, Benjamin Banneker's job was to lay out the cornerstones for the city using the stars.  He was a self-taught mathematician.  He invented and built the first clock in this country.  It was made out of wood.  Wrote great almanacs, and it (unclear) correspondent with Thomas Jefferson.  It was really some of the moving force that changed Thomas Jefferson's view of the intellect of Negroes.  So, Benjamin Banneker was never under a 1791 [1791] commission.  He probably never met Pierre L'Enfant.  He worked harder than anybody else in that very win--very cold wet spring of 1791 [1791].  Pier--in its-Silvio Bedini is the foremost scholar on Benjamin Banneker.  And, will tell you that he got up earlier than anybody else, and worked later.  And, was really responsible then for laying the cornerstones.  The myth goes on that Benjamin Banneker--that Pierre L'Enfant had an argument with George Washington, and gathered up his plans and went back to France.  Pierre L'Enfant is buried over here in a cemetery in Rock Creek Park [Washington, D.C.] and had a--did have an argument with George Washington.  George Washington fired him.  Thomas Jefferson delivered the, the termination letter to him from George Washington, but Benjamin Banneker did not recreate them from, from scratch.  And, to tell the story that everybody always says, it really demeans this man, who's a great intellect, having been a self-taught person; self-taught astronomer, mathematician, clock maker, writer of almanacs, corresponding with Thomas Jefferson, that's enough.  You have to have a p--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you wouldn't call him an architect?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  Well thank--
Speaker 2: A mathematician and astrologer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Astronomer not astrologer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Astronomer.  Right, right.
Speaker 2: Astronomer.  He studied the stars.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Yeah, and that, that's--I've seen that book ['The Life of Benjamin Banneker: The First African American Man of Science'] and I need to get it--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a great book.
Speaker 1: A copy of it.
Speaker 2: It's a great book.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 151898
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, you've heard me talk about growing up in--at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] in a segregated Washington, D.C.  And, you've heard me talk about the opportunities that came out of that experience.  I think that we've lost that opportunity.  And, that we're slowly recreating it in a different configuration.  When I grew up at Howard University all the faculty lived around campus.  The campus owned maybe thirty or forty houses in the community and they, and they rented them to faculty.  Everybody lived within one or two blocks of here.  We had faculty that lived in New York, had faculty that live in New York that commutes here; comes down three times a week.  Almost--with the, with the exception of the property that was done by President Swygert restoring the LeDroit Park historic district.  Faculty lived everywhere.  They lived in Maryland.  They lived in Virginia.  They lived in Pennsylvania.  They lived everywhere.  So, we had to, once again, regain that sense of community that we had that carried us through the hard times.  And, it gets regained and different--in different forms, but I think that's important.  And, then we have to--there's a, there's a saying, "each one teach one."  I truly believe that that you have to reach back and give some of what you've got to the generations behind you.  One account, [Mordecai] Wyatt Johnson used to always say--he gave, he gave a great speech where he beseeched the graduating class to go work in basement's bottom, which is an area of Houston [Texas], across the tracks that needed help.  And, that you're here at Howard to gain, to give back.  In fact, our motto is, "Truth and Service."  We have a very large service component going on in the University (unclear) students.  And, our students are committed to service.  They're truly committed to service.  They work in high schools.  They work in junior high schools.  They teach kids architecture.  They tutor.  They mentor.  So they understand that, and this generation behind us understands that and the importance of it, and we have to support them in that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 151899
Speaker 1: In terms of giving back and, and I guess helping young students, tell us something about NOMA.  I know NOMA has projects, the National Organization of Minority Architects--
Speaker 2: Minority Architects.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: National Association of Minority Architects [sic. National Organization of Minority Architects].  We have an, we have an enormous group here, National Organization of Minority Architects students, and they're having a meet and greet on Friday.  And, Marshall Purnell, one of the NOMA's presidents is gonna come, he's in a firm here in town, is gonna come and talk to our students about his projects and what it means to be an architect.  That's what NOMA should be doing.  And, NOMA should be, be dealing with the next generation to replace them.  There have been seventy-five African American fellows of the AIA [American Institute of Architects].  In any given time, they're about two thousand of the whole population of architects in this country, there two thousand fellows.  And, you're, you're actually nominated and then, and then you're elected into the College of Fellows.  Last year we had two.  Twenty-five percent of them are either Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] faculty or Howard graduates.  Howard has a great track record in the [AIA] College of Fellows.  And, we need to--like we reach back to help the generation too back.  We need to reach back to our generation and bring them up into that wonderful spotlight of being able--of being a member of the College of Fellows.  All the, all the--that's not true--most of the presidents of NOMA are members of the College of Fellows at the AAA, the American Association of Architects [sic.].  And, we need to, we need to spread that glory around.  I truly believe that we should spread that glory around.  When I became a fellow in 1990 [1990], I made a decision that I was gonna make at least one, if not two black fellows, every year behind me.  And, I've been pretty successful with that.  And, I ask people that I sponsor to do the same thing.  I need you to do that.  But, I'm an academician.  They're practitioners.  They're busy.  So, I've taken that gap.  But, I think that the more of us that have honors, the stronger we become.   This year, our major push was to get Jack Travis in the College of Fellows, and, I'm convinced that he will become.  And, we were very careful.  Everybody that signed, that wrote letters for him, African Americans.  Everybody who signed this petition was African Americans, and Jack's package is distinctly Africentric [ph.].  It'll be very interesting to see, to see what happens with Jack when he, when he comes through.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you've been, you've worked on--you're associated with the Underground Railroad Museum [sic. National Underground Railroad Freedom Center] of Cincinnati [Ohio], too.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  In '95 [1995], I was on the team to help them select among a dozen sites to, to put this on.  And, none of them I found satisfactory.  And, then I looked around on my own and identified the central [Ohio] River where the John Roebling Suspension Bridge comes across from Kentucky.  We need to be on that access.  And, I negotiated with this (laughter)--this site is owned, pieces of it's owned by the state, county, and the city.  So, I negotiated among those three entities to get, to get that site.  And, then I wrote the urban design criteria of what was gonna be around us so we control, so we wouldn't have bars around us.  So, in the development we have a buffer, and it's a wonderful site.  And, then I wrote the program for the building to have them select the architect.  I don't do a lot of drawing anymore, 'cause I don't have time.  But, I love doing what I call project development and communication.  Where I'm up front and I get it started right so it has a strong foundation to move forward.  Because, if you start--President [H. Patrick] Swygert always says, "Where you start, is where you end."  If you start on some shaky foundation and premises, then when you get to the end, you don't have what you're supposed to have.  So, I was--I do--I'm doing that for the Goree Memorial in Dakar, Senegal, chairman of the international commission, UNESCO [United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization] international commission to build that.  And, we're setting the foundation for that to happen in the appropriate way.
Speaker 1: So, this is--what will this memorial consist of?  Or, is it, is it--I know it's in the development stages, but what--
Speaker 2: It's gonna be, it's gonna be a museum.  It's not on Glory, Goree [Island, Dakar, Senegal] is two miles off the shore of Dakar.  So, it's on the edge of Dakar with observation tower that looks out toward Goree.  It's a museum and a memorial.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, we got an international competition.  It was a one by a young man from Milan [Italy], and Pierre Goudiaby [Atepa], now doing this whole thing for president, for President Wade.  We're gonna design a new one.  But, all the principles that I put together for the first one is still applicable to this second design.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 151900
Speaker 1: What are your future plans?
Speaker 2: Well, a couple a weeks ago I told my wife that I was gonna retire.  She could have it all.  She could have the house.  That I was gonna go to qualifying school and try to get on the senior golf tournament.  She says, "I've known you--you've always been crazy, but that's the craziest idea that you've ever had."  I don't know, I sit here, I'm involved in a lot of projects.  I'm involved in the billion dollar redevelopment of the old [Washington, D.C.] convention center site, with Gerald Hines' team out of Houston [Texas].  But, I sit here prepared, waiting for divine intervention to show me the next thing to do.  I have no plan.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have no plan.
Story_ID: 151901
Speaker 1: Well, in regard to what you've done already, what would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I was--I've been president of two national architectural organizations; there're three.  There're the--there's the AIA [American Institute of Architects], then there's the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture to which is the educators' organization.  There's a NCARB, the National Council of Architectural Registration Board[s], which is the fifty states architectural licensing board and five, five other jurisdictions: Guam, [Washington] District of Columbia, [U.S.] Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Northern Marianas [Northern Mariana Islands].  And, I've been president of the National Architectural Accrediting Board, which is the organization that accredits all the schools of architecture.  So, I'm the first African American to preside over two of the national organizations.  And, my message to, to those who have come behind me, or who alongside of me is that, this is all possible.  That if Harry Robinson [HistoryMaker Harry G. Robinson, III] can do this, not a very good student in junior school, a lot of potential but totally distracted.  If Harry Robinson can do this, then you, too, can do this.  You simply prepare, and you find a way to get in, and you work hard, and you'll get what you want out of (unclear).
Story_ID: 151902
Speaker 1: One last question, it's similar to legacy, but a little different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I have a friend, Harold Bartonelli, who says, "You know, Harry, at our age all we're doing is trying be friendly to people so that they'll come to your funeral." (Laughter)  Harold, Harold's that kinda guy.  He said, "You know, you've already written your obituary."  So, we're just out here trying make friends, we don't wanna piss anybody off at this point.  I'd like to be remembered as, as somebody who took what he had and did the best that he could with it and tried to help a lot of people and tried not to hurt anybody.
