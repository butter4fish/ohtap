 Larson  Today is October 19, 2012. My name is Mary Larson, and we are here  today with Larry Fisher. Welcome back to OSU for your fifty year class  reunion.  Thank you.  I know you   re still fairly local. You   re down in Norman. Were there  some special reasons you decided to come back for this particular  reunion?  I come back to almost all of them. I   ve had season tickets for thirty  years, so it   s another year, but I   ve been looking forward to this and  maybe an old friend will show up. Maybe I   ll see somebody. I   m always  amazed by what a big impact being at somewhere only four years had on  my life, and being at OSU four years certainly did that.  What are some of the things you   re most looking forward to seeing or  doing while you   re here?  Doing the Walkaround tonight with my son if he drives up from  Norman. He may come, and we   ll do the walk around. Then tomorrow is  the ball game, of course. I always enjoy the games. I like to go through  the Union, hang out there, go out on the patio, listen to the clock, listen  to the chimes, and just look around, see places I recall.  Have you been through the Union since it   s been     Oh, yes, incredible remodeling. It looks great. It   s very popular now, full  of students. I was over there at lunch. I enjoy that very much.  Before we talk about OSU, can you tell me a little bit about where you  grew up and some of the details of your early life?  5  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  I grew up in Sand Springs, Oklahoma, which is west of Tulsa about  twelve miles. I actually grew up west of there a couple of miles, a little  neighborhood, a community. It was on Willow Street, but I didn   t know  the name of the street. It was called Eucha Creek because there   s a creek  runs through the valley. I tell people me and my friends were free-range  kids. We went out in the morning, just us and the dogs, and ran wild.  Don   t go down on the Arkansas River. Don   t go across the bridge to the  north. We had about a mile-and-a-half valley, hills on both sides. We  just had a grand time being Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer, so it was a real  childhood. We did have a few animals, horses and dogs and cats and  cows, and did have a garden every now and then, so I did the usual stuff.  We weren   t farmers. My dad worked in a factory.  Was there a particular factory?  The textile mill there that was called Commander Mills. My family  moved to Sand Springs to work in that factory in the    20s. I worked in it  when I was in high school, summertime, and in college. The first two  summers in college I worked at Commander Mills. It was an experience.  Everybody should have to work in a factory sometime in their life or do  eight hours of repetitive task. Your hands learn to work without your  brain, and you daydream. It was so loud, I could sing and nobody could  hear me. I could sing anything I wanted anytime I wanted. It was just  very loud, very humid because we were using thread. There was no air  conditioning. It was summertime, so it was a free sauna. That   s where I  grew up, Sand Springs, Eucha Creek, west of there.  Sounds like you had a real gang to hang around.  I did. I had a bunch of pals. We started off riding wagons and then bikes  and then eventually worked our way up to cars. There weren   t many  girls. It was half a dozen guys and a couple of sisters, but they were too  smart to hang out with us. They knew better. We fished and didn   t do  much hunting, a little bit. Mainly went down on the creek and just  played. I think it helped me tremendously just because I was turned  loose. My mother would tell me,    You can either get out of this house,  or you can start washing windows,    so I was gone.  That was incentive to get out of the house. (Laughter)  Yes, she wanted me out of the way so she could do her cleaning and do  her stuff, have the house to herself. Sometimes I had to take my little  brother. That was a bit of a chore.  How much younger was he?  6  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  He was five years younger, but he had a group of pals, so we   d get them  together and let them do their thing. I now know (I didn   t know then) the  mothers had a network, a phone network. We just thought we were  running free, but I now know every hour or two, my mother would call  someone else, Mrs. Stockton or Mrs. Stern, and say,    Are the boys down  there?    Say,    Yes, they   re out in the backyard,    or,    Some have gone up  on the hill.    They kept an eye on us indirectly with the party line phone.  Long before the internet was invented, they had their own network.  (Laughs)  Facebook before Facebook existed. (Laughs)  A long time.  Do you remember   I   ve talked to some folks who lived around, I think it  was, the Sand Springs area where they talked about some encampments  down on the river? Were those there when you were growing up?  Oh, no, there were people that I now know that lived on the river, but I  didn   t know it at the time. I wasn   t looking for encampments or homes  or anything. I was looking for open area and wilderness. I now know   I  mean, you learn these at class reunions. One of our classmates, who I am  so thrilled for because her and her husband travel the world, they   ve  been everywhere. She grew up living on one of those little rural streets  there in Sand Springs. Her family literally lived in a tipi with a dirt floor.  She was Indian, and they grew up living in a tipi. I had no clue at the  time. She was just another quiet girl in class. It was thrilling at the last  class reunion to talk to her and her husband because they have literally  traveled the world. I   m going,    Sarah, you   ve come a long way to get to  see everything, having been so isolated there living like that.    I heard on  the radio one of my Sand Springs guys you all interviewed recently,  Monty Box, talking about when his dad brought him to his first football  game. My first recollection of Stillwater is a football game. My dad  brought me over here for Homecoming 1947-1948.  Did your folks go to college?  No, I had brothers over here. I had a brother living in Vet Village. Came  out of World War II, lived in Vet Village. We   d come over and bring  him groceries, him and his wife. Then they had a baby, and we   d come  over and bring them groceries, visit with them, go to the football game.  So you   d seen the campus before you came here.  Many times. I had another brother, by the time I was fourteen, he was in  7  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  school here in the early    50s. I came over and spent a weekend with him  at the fraternity house when I was in the ninth grade. That was probably  the single best weekend of my life up to that point. I thought I had died  and gone to heaven. High school was a waste of time. I was just waiting  to go to OSU because I spent the weekend with a bunch of fraternity  guys, and it was mindboggling. They didn   t do anything. They were just  semi-grown, and I was being treated like one of them. It was a lot of fun.  So you had two older brothers.  Two older brothers went here.  How much older were they?  Well, I   ve actually got four. One was fifteen years older, thirteen years  older, eleven years older, seven years older. Then there   s a little gap and  me, and then the younger brother is five years younger. So there are six  of us sons all together.  No girls?  No girls. Every last one of us were going to be named Susan after my  mother   s mother. Her first granddaughter was named Susan, so she  finally got her Susan.  Finally got it in there. (Laughs)  That   s right, but not directly.  So I get a sense of why you wanted to come to OSU. Do you want to talk  a little bit about the decision-making process for that?  Senior year, for some reason or another, I had developed a very fond  affection for Michigan State. Part of it was the Spartan thing. The whole  reading about the Spartans, learning about them, tough. I didn   t realize  how mean they were, but they were a very disciplined group of people,  and I liked that. I actually had in my hands one time an application to  Michigan State. I thought long and hard about sending it in but decided  ultimately, because of the expense, to go to OSU. It was only sixty miles  away, but it was another universe compared to my hometown.  As most people from small towns learn when you go to college, it is just  another world. I had been over here enough visiting the brothers that I  was familiar with it, and I knew a little bit of what it was going to be  like, so I was doing everything in high school to prepare myself to go to  college. I think I was brainwashed again by my parents. I never knew  8  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  there was a choice. I think the older brothers had choices, and part of  that was the war. Part of it was Korea, where one went to that. But for  me, it was,    You go to high school, you go to college, you get a job, you  get married, you have kids, you die. Push through life.    It was okay with  me. I was just waiting to get out of high school to go to college, and  OSU was the place I   d been.  Did you get interested in chemistry in high school?  Yes, about the sixth grade I told my mother I was going to be a chemist.  I don   t know why. It just came to me. So they got me a little chemistry  set. You couldn   t sell that thing now. Everything in it is illegal now  because it was magnesium, and there was sodium, and there was  calcium. I mean, we blew up stuff and burned stuff and about blinded  ourselves with bright light, burning magnesium. One of those little  chemistry sets that you used to get and mix stuff together and see what  boiled out of the top of the test tube, me and my pals had a wonderful  time with that. Now it   s all baking soda and salt, but back then we had  the real stuff, so we played with that.  I happened to get lucky. Sand Springs hired a young teacher, him and his  wife, and he was the chemistry teacher. He was extremely good. I don   t  think he took a particular interest in me. He just liked the subject, and he  liked students learning. His wife was an English teacher, and she went  on   Look magazine named her Teacher of the Year. A few years later,  she was written up by them. So Dr. Trout got me interested, Verdine  Trout. He went on to work at UCO, so I got to see him. I was on a  project at UCO doing a study for them and got to meet him on a faculty  interview thing we did and brag on him, tell everybody,    That guy over  there, he   s the reason I   m here.     So did you plan on majoring in chemistry when you got to OSU?  Oh, yes. Well, I actually   it   s an interesting time in American history,  1957, the fall. I think that   s when Sputnik happened. The Russians put a  satellite in orbit, and the next day I was grabbed by teachers in the hall.  Two or three of them at different times grabbed me and said,    You   ve  got to become an engineer. You can do it. You   ve got the talent. We  need engineers, and we need them bad. You   ve got to become an  engineer.    So I was shoved by my teachers, as were a bunch of my  classmates, to engineering, whatever that was. I came over here  majoring in engineering, originally, but not knowing that that   s really  what I wanted because I still didn   t know what it was, really. We didn   t  have a class on it in high school.  For a year and a half, I took everything else: the humanities, the social  9  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  studies, and the basic English and all that. Then, second semester of my  sophomore year, I took an engineering course, a civil engineering  course. I dropped it after about two weeks. I thought,    If this is  engineering, I don   t want it.    I switched over to chemistry, which I   ve  told people since,    It   s great. Inorganic cooking is all it is. Mix up the  recipe. See if it turns blue or blows up or whatever.    So I switched to  chemistry. I liked it a lot better. Those engineers are very picky about  their straight lines and the little vectors and right angles. I didn   t care for  that a bit. I   m not a draftsman, so chemistry was a much better choice.  So chemistry it was once you had the class.  Yes, that was my original goal to begin with. Once I actually had an  engineering class for two weeks, I thought,    I   m getting out of here  before he grades that next test.    (Laughter)  Now, were there faculty members either in the Chemistry Department or  in other areas that were really influential as far as you   re concerned?  I wish I could remember names, but amazingly enough, there was an  elderly gentleman who taught scientific German. We had to learn to  read, at a basic level, scientific German. I don   t remember his name. Our  classroom was, of all places, as I recall it, the Fire Protection building up  on the second or third floor. He was a delightful old man, and I liked that  class. It was my last semester. The only time I remember after a  semester going by and thanking a professor for making a class that I  thought was going to be terrible, interesting, and how much I   d enjoyed  it. He looked at my grades, and he said,    Well, let me look at how you  did here.    He said,    Well, I can see where you got that.    I said,    I didn   t  come to talk to you about changing my grade. I just want to thank you.     He said,    Well, I can see where you got that. We   ll just make it an A.     So I talked my way into an A instead of a B. (Laughs) That wasn   t my  intent. I really liked him.  Then there was an elderly professor over at the Chemistry Department  named Dr.  Sylvan  Wood, as I recall, who taught analytical chemistry.  He was also delightful, just a pleasant, aging faculty member who had  this little brown book in his back pocket. You would do an experiment,  and you had to get two answers, and the answers had to be very close  together, like 35.1, 35.2. He would take out this dog-eared, little, brown  book, open it up, thumb through the pages and look and say,    Oh, you   re  a little low there. Why don   t you run that experiment again.       How  much is a little? I   ll give you another number. I   ll go out in the hall and  come back.    (Laughs) We had to do the whole thing over because he  had the answers in his book. I enjoyed that class very much.  10  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Some of the ROTC   I took Advanced ROTC. Some of the ROTC  professors, there was a Captain Wolfe that I enjoyed very much. Big  guy. I don   t recall the name, but there was a sergeant over there who was  the tallest soldier in the United States Army. He   d gotten into World  War II when they didn   t stop you on height. He was like six eleven. He  was a good sergeant. I got to play volleyball against him, and he just  about killed me because his spikes came from the third floor. (Laughter)  You mentioned a minute ago that you had some of your classes in the  fire   that scientific German class there.  Had that one class   as I recall it, that   s where I remember it being.  Where were some of your other classes? Do you remember?  Oh, the early years they were in the Classroom Building, most of them. I  didn   t take business courses, so I wasn   t in the business school. Then the  chemistry and physics building was brand new, so junior and senior  year, took an awful lot of classes in that building. I   m looking forward to  going to the Bellmon Research Building because that   s where the old  dairy barn was.  And it   s beautiful.  I   m looking forward to seeing it. The chemistry-physics was new, and  that was fun, being in new labs, new stuff. The physics building used to  be (I don   t know what it   s called now) across the street from the Union  to the east, right across the street. We took some classes in there. Where  the journalism building is now over there by the Union, there were some  chem labs in there. I remember blowing something up in there with  sulfuric acid. I had on a lab apron, but the next time my wife washed that  long-sleeved shirt, the sleeves were full of holes because it was covered  in sulfuric acid. (Laughs) Ate it up.  Thank heavens for protective gear. (Laughs)  We wore the glasses, and we wore the apron, and it kept us alive.  I   m just thinking you must have some real stories to tell about some of  those labs. (Laughs)  I have some real   I made a list. I didn   t print it out. I forgot to bring it,  but I made a list of all kinds of things that happened to me, both in class  and as a campus person and in the fraternity and the sports world and all  that stuff.  11  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Speaking of buildings, did you study at all in the library?  Yes.  It would have been fairly new then, still.  It was fairly new, and, yes, I came here regularly. In fact, it   s funny how  you go through a college career like that and most of the stuff is just  faded memories clouded up in your brain, but every now and then, some  little thing pops out. I remember an instant here in this building on the  ground floor in one of the study rooms. I was reading our chemistry  book, reference document book they   d given us to look at. I read a  chapter, and it explained why some things are magnetic and some are  not. It hit me just like a light that comes on.    Well, of course, now I  understand. That   s why those are magnetic and why these aren   t.    That  was a simple thing about the number of electrons in the outer ring. If  they had an odd number, they were magnetic. If they didn   t, they  weren   t. Like aluminum isn   t; iron is. Even or odd. I   m going,    Yes,  they attract each other. That makes all the sense in the world,    but I just  hadn   t thought of it.  Right, it   s not something that     I had that moment. I hope it was right, (Laughter) but I had that moment  here in this building. I had a lot of dates here, a lot of study dates. We   d  come here. Get a date, and we would come over and do homework  together.  So this was a social hangout, as well.  A little bit of a social   we   d go to the Union, get a drink, cup of coffee.  Well, I didn   t drink coffee. Get a Coke or something and come to the  library for a couple hours and then go back to the Union and kind of  close it down, take her back to the dorm.  Speaking of student housing, I think you were in a fraternity?  I was in a fraternity the whole time. I never lived in student housing at  all.  So which fraternity?  Delta Chi. They   re not here anymore. Like all guys who have ever seen  the movie Animal House, it was our fraternity in many ways, mainly the  look of the house. We lived in two wood-framed houses. We were 306  South Jefferson. There was a wood-frame house with a drive between,  12  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  and on the other side was another wood-frame house. An elderly lady  lived downstairs, and we rented the upstairs from her. Then there was a  garage apartment in the back that had been converted, and we rented  that. So we had this horseshoe fraternity house, and these two wood-frame  houses, and this garage apartment area.  Was she informally your house mom? (Laughs) She was just the land  lady or     No, she was just the lady who lived downstairs. We had a house mom  who was the house mom, and she lived in the main house.  How many lived in the house?  Well, when I got there, there were forty or so. We had a big pledge class,  thirteen or fourteen. The next year, we had like twenty-one. The  numbers went up to about seventy. We let a few guys live in Bennett  Hall or in the dorms simply because we didn   t have room for them. We  got pretty big during that time period. That was my first few years in  college. That second year, I met a young woman, and by the third year I  was married, so the fraternity had to take care of itself. I had my own  fraternity. (Laughter)  Why did you pick that particular   what was it about Delta Chi?  My older brother Connie had been a Delta Chi. He had gone in the  Army, done his military duty, come out and used his GI Bill money a  little bit, and then went to OSU to get a degree in music education. He  became a music teacher. He taught at Sand Springs, taught at Bristow,  taught at   I don   t remember if it was Hominy or Nowata or somewhere,  but mainly Bristow and Sand Springs. He was in the fraternity, so I got  introduced. I came over, and I had a couple things they wanted. One, I  was a legacy, so they had no choice, but two, I had good grades in high  school. I never met a fraternity yet that didn   t need a grade point. I had  good high school grades, and they said,    Snap him up. He studies.     Was this particular fraternity known for anything special?  Well, the year before, they had won sweepstakes in the Homecoming  house decoration contest. No, it was that year. They had been doing  Homecoming decoration, but they won sweepstakes my freshman year.  Then my sophomore year, we won first place in house decoration. Then  the junior year, they won sweepstakes again. So they got very popular  for that.  Were the house decs a lot like they are now?  13  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Yes, I   ve got pictures of them. I can show you in a little bit if you want  to see them.  Oh, okay. Sure.  Very much so. I   ll tell you a funny story about one of the house  decorations. The third year when I wasn   t involved, we had moved to  University Boulevard. There was a sorority house. I think it was the  Kappa Deltas. We bought it from them to get more space. It faced  Bennett Chapel. It   s a parking lot now, but I went over there because I  was married and doing my thing. I went over to see the house  decoration. It looked gorgeous. They had built this futuristic city with all  these logan three kind of things, all these house modern buildings. It was  kind of an Emerald City with fast cars and flying planes, very elaborate,  very lit up, a lot of electricity.  I   m standing across the street with one of the members, and I said,    That  must cost you a fortune in the electric bill because look at that thing.     They said,    Not costing us anything.    I go,    What do you mean?    He  said,    Look at those two trees.    Well, there was a big tree on the corner  by the fraternity, and across the street there was a big tree on the curb  near Bennett Chapel. I looked up high, and about twenty feet in the air  there was an extension cord running across the street. I went over and  looked, and they had found an outdoor plug at Bennett Chapel. They  were running the house decoration with Bennett Chapel electricity.  (Laughs)  I bet they never knew what hit them when the electric bill came in.  (Laughter)  I don   t know what they did. Oh, it was only a couple of nights.  Right, no, but     I   m sure they   re going,    We   ve got to turn the lights off in this building.  We   re leaving them on way too much.    I can   t believe they didn   t get  caught. I mean, this cord ran right across University Avenue, (Laughs)  but it was high enough to stay out of the trees.  Yes, people just aren   t looking up there.  We had a genius electrician in the fraternity that did all the decorations  on electricity. He went on and moved to Tulsa. I   m not going to give his  name, but he spent decades in Tulsa selling his services doing Christmas  decorations for people on their homes because that   s what he did. He  14  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  was extremely good at it, but he was also sneaky. (Laughter)  What was life like in that particular fraternity house before you ended  up moving out?  Most of the time it was a lot of fun. It was just a bunch of guys doing  what guys do. We had some pretty serious behaviors. We   d have one  formal dinner a week where you had to wear a coat and tie, eat with a  knife and fork, and act like you knew what you were doing. The house  mother kind of monitored that to make sure we behaved ourselves. We  had to do chores, particularly the pledges. We had to do chores. You got  demerits if you didn   t clean up like you were supposed to and do all the  chores assigned to you in the time frame. That was monitored by people.  What we did not do, and one of the reasons I pledged Delta Chi, (they  were a little older group in some cases) I was never physically   and  nobody is going to believe this, but I was never physically harassed. I  was never made to wear gunny sacks under my clothes, or hit with  paddles or anything. The closest I came to being harassed was the week  I was being initiated. They made me and a couple other guys give water  speech. You had to give a speech on the Nile River and never mention  the word    water    in any form. Every time you did, you had to drink a  glass of water. At some point, I finally told them, they said,    Okay,  you   re running out of steam on the story. Just start saying the alphabet.     Invariably, someone would say,    Can I start at the back?    They   d say,     Sure.    So they   d say,    Z,    and they   d go,    That   s it, zater, z  Drink a  glass of water.    (Laughs)  I finally had to tell them,    Guys, I can feel the water. I   m not drinking  anymore water. The next one is going to be in my throat,    so they let me  go. But I was not harassed in the sense that you typically hear about  hazing or any of that stuff. I was not forced to drink. I don   t drink, never  drank. It   s one of the reasons I joined them. They told me,    It won   t be a  problem. You don   t want to drink? Don   t drink. You don   t want to  smoke? Don   t smoke.     Do you think it was because it was a slightly older group?  I think when my brother was there, he had been in the military, been out,  and it was some older guys. I later met some of them, working, over the  years. They were mature, they weren   t going to be badgered, they had  their military behind them, and they just weren   t going to put up with it.  We had pledge week the week we went through initiation. We did have  education week, and we had to learn stuff. We had to learn about the  fraternities and remember all the national presidents. Had to walk around  the campus, were shown things, and had to be able to identify them later  15  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  taking a tour of the campus.    What   s the name of that building? What  about this building? What   s this over here?    Some of them were quirky  little things, but it was kind of fun. We didn   t get a lot of sleep. We had  to clean the house, paint a lot of rooms. I went to sleep sitting on a  ladder, painting a wall. (Laughter) Woke up that way.  That   s impressive. (Laughs)  It was all part of the process of wearing us down for the initiation  ceremony, but at no time did anybody touch me, hit me, harass me, and  all of that. I had a good time with them, and we all treated each other  pretty much as adults.  Did you have curfews in the fraternity house?  We probably did, but I don   t remember that being an issue. I know the  girls did in the dorms, so once they went home, we went home. Didn   t  have anywhere else to go. There were probably guys who went places,  but I didn   t go. I didn   t have a car, I didn   t drink, so wasn   t anywhere I  was going to go.  You talked a little bit about the house decs for Homecoming. Were there  other things that your fraternity did for Homecoming?  We had a number of special dances. We had a Sleepwalkers Ball where  everybody wore pajamas, which was as close as we came to a toga party.  We had a Valentine   s dance where one of the guys had to dress up as  Cupid, wear a diaper, fake-shooting rubber arrows at people. We had the  White Carnation Formal, which was very formal. You wore the most  formal thing you could get your hands on. The girls wore their formal  dress. We did it usually in the Union in one of the ballrooms there. We   d  have some very formal social events like that. There was a thing called a  Pledge Sneak, where the pledges one weekend would run off, steal the  dinner, run off, go to Tulsa or somewhere, and leave the members to  fend for themselves for a change. Pledges got to do that once a semester.  It was a bonding thing, get them close together.  Are you still in touch with any of the folks?  A little bit. Not much. We did have a thirty year reunion over there, or  maybe thirty-five, and I came back and saw a number of guys and  enjoyed it very much. The fraternity doesn   t exist anymore. It   s not on  this campus any longer for a lot of reasons. I don   t know. Those old  houses wore out. We built a lodge house with an apartment, and they  tried that model, having the lodge house for the meetings and all, but the  apartments could be rented to either members or independent students.  16  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  They did that for a number of years, but I don   t know what happened.  They ran out of steam. Fraternities in general had a problem in the    80s  and    90s on campuses. They   ve tried to start it again a couple times.  Same thing happened to the OU chapter. They had a chapter down there.  It died off, too.  Now, you mentioned you got married while you were in college.  Yes, I did.  Did you meet your wife at one of these events?  Indirectly. To me, it   s a very interesting story. To most people, it   s  probably just boring. Somewhere out there, there was a woman, a young  girl at the time, who punched a button, and because she punched a  button, I met my wife. She didn   t know she did it. I never met her. Don   t  have any idea who she was. It was, like, a Wednesday night, first week  of school. My house mother, Ms. Clayton, asked me, she said,    I need a  favor. There   s a young girl   I know her parents. She   s a student, a  freshman over at Murray Hall, and her parents want her to come visit  with me, say hello, and tell me how she   s doing. I want to meet her so if  she needs anything, she has an adult she can call. I just need an escort.  Would you go over and get her and bring her over here? You don   t have  to date her. I   m not looking for you to entertain her. Just walk her over  here, I   ll meet with her an hour, and then you   ll walk her back.    I said,     Okay.     So I go over there, and at that time, you didn   t go up on the second and  third floors. You went to the lobby, and there was a little counter. You  told them,    Room 312,    and they punched a buzzer. If room 312 got that  acknowledgment, they   d punch their buzzer, the light came on, and you  knew,    Okay, they know I   m here.    So I went over there,    Room 312,     and they punched the button, and the button answered. I went in to sit  down and wait. When I went in there, there was a young lady sitting on a  couch. She was blonde, (I was expecting a blonde) but she was already  downstairs. I   m going,    Well, she was on the third floor. She hadn   t had  time to get down.    All I had to do was turn right and take two steps.  I sit down here, she sat over here, and for the next forty-five minutes,  she and I watched people come and go. The people would come in and  go there, no, nothing, nothing, nothing. Finally, it   s just me and her, so I  ask her. I said,    Are you such and so?    She goes,    Yes. Are you Larry?     I said,    How   d you beat me downstairs?    She said,    Oh, my roommate  answered the buzz. I came down early.       Okay.    So she and I go over.  She meets the house mother. While they   re meeting, I walk in the dining  room at the fraternity house, and there   s a dozen people there. They   d  17  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  come over from the Baptist student center, some of my fraternity  brothers and some girls that were walking around campus, from their  hometown. I noticed this one, and I really thought she was cute. I really  liked her. We visited a few minutes, and then they left. They weren   t  there ten minutes.  Then thirty minutes later, this girl comes out, and I took her back to the  dorm. I never saw her again, but I remembered that girl that had come  over. I asked the guy that was with her. I said,    Are you dating her?    He  said,    No, we just met. I don   t know her.    So I called her up, and we  went out and started dating, and she became my wife. We got married  the next year. The big important person in the story is the roommate of  the girl I was waiting with, who saw the buzzer come on and punched  the button. If she hadn   t done that or if I had known this was the girl, we  would have gone forty-five minutes earlier and I would have completely  missed those BSU  Baptist Student Union  students and probably never  seen my wife. You never know. You punch a button, you cross a street,  you stop when somebody goes in front of you, you never know what  impact it can have. That girl has no idea she made a fifty-two year  marriage.  Now, where was your wife from?  She was from Enid. Her dad was city manager at Enid, Gerald Wilkins.  Her name is Carol. They sent her to OSU to get her away from a  boyfriend she had in high school who went to OU because they didn   t  particularly care for him, and she agreed to that. She was beginning to  have her doubts about him, too. She said,    I   ll try it a year. I   ll try a year,  and if I don   t like it I can switch.    They said,    Fair enough.     And this was your sophomore year?  This was my sophomore year that I met her, yes, her freshman year.  Okay. That   s a wonderful story.  Yes.  So you got married the next year, probably over the summer?  No, we got married in September, right at the start of the semester, or  very early in the semester.  That would have been your junior year?  Yes. My grades weren   t all that great my second semester of sophomore  18  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  year. My mother had a conversation with me, and I told her,    I   ll see  what I can do.    I knew what the problem was: I was spending too much  time with her. (Laughs) We saw each other off and on during the  summer. Somewhere in there, she was in a car wreck. She was a  passenger in a car wreck and was very fortunate to not be killed. That  really got my attention that I could   ve lost her. Late that summer, about  the time school was starting and she was going to come back to school, I  thought,    I don   t think I can be successful running around seeing you all  the time, so why don   t we just get married? That   s what we   re going to  do sometime. Why don   t we do it?    So we got married.  What did your parents think?  Oh, my mother was cataclysmic upset. She said,    It   s going to seem like  you   ve been married all your life     And I went,    Is that bad? Is there  something wrong with that that I   m missing?    (Laughs) I said,    If you  want me to stay in school, you better let me get married because I   m not  doing all that well studying on my own. At least it will take me out of  circulation. It will pin me down. I   ll be in one spot.    That worked. That  worked fine. I could focus on school, and we could focus on being  together. So, that year, we got married. A year later, we had a baby. The  next May,    62, we graduated.  So were you in married-student housing after that?  No, there was no such thing to my knowledge. It   s interesting to me,  every place I lived in Stillwater has been torn down. (Laughs) We lived  in a quadruplex, an old house converted into four apartments, down on  South Hester, 603 South Hester. She was kind of the dorm mother of the  house. Bunch of independent guys living in the other apartments, and  her and me, so she became their mother confessor. They asked her  opinion. They cried on her shoulder when their girlfriends broke up with  them. She kept them supplied with cookies. The next year, we had the  baby. We moved to 714 North Hester in a duplex and lived there all year  until we graduated. But all those   the North Hester is part of the  Athletic Village Complex, South Hester is a doctor   s office, the  University Street, former Kappa Delta house, is a parking lot, and  there   s new apartments over on Jefferson. I walk around and look and  remember.  I know that once you were married, it might have been tougher to be  involved in campus organizations     Oh, you just weren   t as interested.     right, but prior to that, were there any groups that you were  19  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  particularly involved with?  No. I was in ROTC. When you go in advanced ROTC, you   re involved.  I did not get in Scabbard and Blade. I could hear those guys going by at  three in the morning, doing jody calls, running. I was married by then,  but I was active in ROTC. I did get involved with the sports activities in  the fraternity: volleyball, softball, some of those things, flag football.  Played a lot of those. I don   t recall   I don   t think I joined any campus  social groups.  I did one time   my career as a professional entertainer   I worked for  Student Entertainers. It was my first semester freshman year, last week  of school on a Wednesday night. I get a call from the guy who managed  them. I want to say Arch Alexander, but I don   t know if that   s the right  name. He called me, and he said,    You   re Larry Fisher?    I said,    Yes.     He said,    I saw you play piano at Interfraternity Sing. You really did a  good job.    I said,    Well, thank you.    He says,    I was wondering if you   d  be available to play the piano Friday night at a dinner. There are groups  having a dinner, and they just need background music, and then there   s a  band. You   ll play for an hour, and then when the band comes, you   ll be  free, and we   ll pay you five bucks.     Most people went home on Friday, (Friday was the end of the semester)  but I was in no hurry to go home at all. I enjoyed college. I enjoyed  being there. I said,    Sure.    So I went out to one of these meeting places,  played the piano for an hour. This band comes in. One of my high-school  buddies was playing the bass in the band. He and I visited. When  they were ready, I quit, took my music, and went back to the fraternity,  and I went home Saturday. A couple weeks later, I got a check in the  mail for five dollars, and they never called me again. (Laughs) I now  know I was the last piano player in town. Everybody else was gone. If I  didn   t do it, they weren   t going to find anybody. (Laughs) Oh, well. I  had a career as a musician, at least for a little while.  There you go. That   s more than some people can say.  That   s right  (Laughter)  What did you and your wife do for   I mean, did you have a social group  of other married students?  She had a roommate that she   d gone to high school with, junior high and  high school. We introduced her to one of my fraternity brothers, and  they started dating. They would come over, and we   d play cards. They  later got married, and they   re still married. They live in Bartlesville,  Robert and Beth Hanes. We had those guys in that first house. We had  20  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  those guys who would come around for various things. (Laughs) We  went home pretty regularly. My folks gave me an old car my dad had.  They bought a new car. We   d either go to Sand Springs one weekend or  we   d go to Enid. We   d be here a weekend, then we   d go home one  place, and be here a weekend, and go home to the other. We spent the  two years   we knew when I graduated I was going to be going into the  Army, and we were going to be long gone somewhere, so we spent a lot  of time going home on the weekends, seeing family, particularly after  we had the baby. Both sets of grandparents wanted to see the baby.  Little boy? Little girl?  Little girl, Lisa. She later went to OSU. All my kids went to OSU in one  form or another. Yes, little girl. Let   s see. There used to be a dime movie  downtown. When we lived on South Jefferson, we   d walk to the movie.  I remember seeing   what was the big Cecil B. DeMille? I just went  blank. About Moses     Oh, The Ten Commandments.  Yes, The Ten Commandments. I saw The Ten Commandments for a dime  or twenty cents.  And that was a long one. That had a big intermission.  We got our money   s worth on that one. We   d walk downtown. It wasn   t  that far. We walked everywhere, basically. Later, my wife got a job. Oh,  cute story there. My oldest brother, when he was in school here on the  GI Bill after World War II, his wife got a job at Katz Department Store.  This would be like 1947, 1948, at Christmas, learning to make bows for  Christmas packages and wrapping packages. Well, in 19   whatever it  was      60, that Christmas after we got married, my wife got the same job  at Katz Department Store. Probably paid the same amount ten years or  twelve years later, (Laughs) but she really learned to make bows really  well and got very good at it. To this day she still makes these beautiful  bows for Christmas packages for family members.  I was going to say, she   s the most popular person in the family come  Christmastime.  Your Christmas package from her actually comes wrapped with a bow  on it, not in a sack with some paper shoved on top of it. I thought it was  intriguing that my sister-in-law and my wife both had the same job  twelve years apart at Katz. Katz is also long gone.  Although the building is still there.  21  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  The building is there.  Have you been in since they   ve renovated it?  No.  They still have the Katz sign downstairs.  Oh, do they? That would be fun to see. That   s mainly what we did. We  didn   t do a lot. We spent a lot of time at home just being a couple. She  discovered a game out at TG Y called Yahtzee. Never heard of it, never  seen it, but we started playing Yahtzee, and we played it so much, we  ran out of score pads. She wrote the company about,    How do I get more  score pads?    They sent her a bunch of free ones, and later on we saw  them for sale in stores. We don   t know whether she triggered that or just  a million people writing them. Of course, Yahtzee is now a very popular  game. Everybody knows how to play it. You can get it on software, play  it on your computer. But we were playing Yahtzee before anyone else  and playing cards with Robert and Beth. Had a good time doing that.  Did you go to any sporting events while you were in college?  Much as I could, used my student thing. We   d go to the football games.  Went to some of the basketball games and a few baseball games, but  mainly the football games. Never went too far away.  Any particular players you remember from that era?  Sure, from the    50s? My all-time favorite Oklahoma State football  player   in fact, I   ve been working on a book of sorts about my history  with Oklahoma State football. My all-time favorite was a guy back in  the early    50s or late    40s named Joe Bob O   Neil because he had the  name of three of my brothers: Joe, Bob, and Neil. I never saw him. I  don   t know if he even ever played when I was here, but I remember that.  One of my favorite players back then was a guy named Earl Lunsford.  Earl Lunsford was a   they played both ways, defensive back and a  fullback. Tough as nails. There was a guy named Dale Meinert. Meinert  was a big middle linebacker. Played in the pros. He was there when I  was in high school. Made All Conference. Probably made All American.  I was over at the Athletic Department checking out a volleyball for  something, and while I was talking to the man checking it out, I felt  someone walk in behind me. The man looked over my head and says,     Well, hello, Dale.    I turned around, and it was Dale Meinert. Big as a  tree. Close as I came to meeting him, and he just towered over me. I  22  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  remember going out of there,    And that   s why I don   t play college  football     (Laughter) Another guy named Duane Wood who was a  running back, outstanding player in the blue-gray game, I got to meet  him once. He attended a class I taught. Still looked a splendid specimen  of a man. He was very healthy. Those are some of the names.  Oh, and I did like   we had a guy named Jim Dillard, a running back,  and we had a wide receiver named Chester Pittman. Chester was a little  speed-demon black guy, the first black guy to play at OSU. I saw last  year they had an article about him in the paper. I was thrilled because I  always wondered what happened to him because he was fun to watch.  Gunsmoke was a big TV show, and they always called,    Mr. Dillard and  Chester.    (Laughter) They made a spoof on that. I enjoyed that.  Now, your class would   ve been the second one to go all the way through  the university, I think, with it being OSU instead of Oklahoma A M.  Yes.  Do you remember how students reacted to the change at the time?  By the time I got here, it was accepted. I think I should mention there is  such a thing as called a false memory where you think you remember  something you did, but it   s something somebody told you. So I   m going  to tell you what now may be a false memory, but I think it happened. I  think my senior year in high school, I came to the Homecoming game.  My brother, I think, was here. My older brother bought season tickets,  and I may have come with him. Anyway, that was 1957. They were  changing the name of the school, and they talked about changing the  mascot, and the mascot had basically been Pistol Pete. The original was  still alive, the old, old man. There was talk they were going to change  the mascot, and we were all very upset.    To what? And how?     At halftime, a stagecoach came onto the field, and the field used to have  a track around it. The track meets were held in Lewis Field. The  stagecoach drove all the way around, and old ninety-year-old-or-so  Pistol Pete was riding shotgun. He was up there with a shotgun, which  he probably fired, and everybody   s cheering like crazy. Then they  announced,    Ladies and gentlemen, we now introduce our new mascot.     They open the door of the stage, and out got the first person that I saw  wearing the Pistol Pete head. He was in the stage coach. That was going  to be our new mascot, the Pistol Pete that we all know and love now. Of  course, the stands just went crazy because they were afraid we were  going to get a who-knows-what, a duck or chicken or something. We got  Pistol Pete, himself. So I got to see Pistol Pete Eaton. It was maybe the  next year he died, something like that. For one glorious minute, we  23  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  were   that   s a long way from being the Tigers like we were originally.  Yes. Well, I think we were meant to be the Princeton of the Prairie with  the orange and black.  The Princeton of the Prairies. Yes, I remember telling Robert Kamm that  story, the former president. He was on a board I was directing one time.  We talked about that, the Princeton of the Prairie. Do you want me to  tell you about when I got thrown in Theta Pond?  Oh, sure. I was going to say, that   s actually on here. (Laughter)  Oh, is it? Twice. Twice I got thrown in Theta Pond. The first time was  my freshman year. I had a romance. I started going with a girl, and we  got what they used to call a drop. You gave her a necklace. My fraternity  brothers said,    Well, when you do that, we throw you in Theta Pond.     So they hauled me down there and pitched me in. Nobody told me. I was  impressed. I was thrilled with the honor until I stood up. Nobody told me  Theta Pond was forty-years deep in duck poop. I mean, I went in to my  knees of squishy stuff. I couldn   t bathe enough after I got out of there.  They took my clothes, or at least my shirt. I said,    Where   s my shirt?     Said,    I don   t know. We lost it.     That night we had a flag football game. I go to the game, and here comes  the girl I   m going with. She comes walking up, and she looked vaguely  familiar besides being herself. I realized she was wearing that shirt. That  was cute. She had on my shirt. Then the second time, we had won that  Homecoming decoration, first place. I was in charge of getting it built,  so after we got the trophy and all the next week, they grabbed me up. In  fact, I was in a place called McCaffree   s drug, which was a hangout for  everybody. I came outside, and six guys grabbed me and carried me  down to Theta Pond and threw me in again.  Did you get thrown in when you got engaged?  I bought my way out. (Laughter) You could buy candy or you could buy  cigars or candy cigars. When I started going with the next girl, I bought  my way out. I felt the mud on the bottom of Theta Pond enough. I  thought,    I   m going to catch listeria or something if I keep getting tossed  in this place.    (Laughter) I don   t know if they do that anymore. When  my brother was here about five years later, they cleaned it. They drained  it, and he got to be involved with cleaning Theta Pond. They completely  drained it, and all the students came down and carried muck and  probably fertilized all the pastures and made all the cows healthy and  everything.  24  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Yes, I   ve seen pictures of that. Was Sam the alligator in Theta Pond?  I hope not. I heard the lady on the radio tell about Sam being chained to  the Pi Phi sofa one time by the Betas, but I never saw the alligator. Of  course, people talked about that, but I think he was gone. I think they  had taken Sam away by then. That would have been 1958, 1959. Sam  must   ve been gone, but I didn   t wait around to find out. (Laughter)  You were too mired in duck residue. (Laughs)  Yes, I was deep from half a century of critters being in there.  You mentioned you were in charge of the house decs that year. What all  did that involve? I mean, that   s a huge production.  Well, everybody had to get involved, and you had committee chairs  doing different things. I had a guy in charge of electronics. I had a guy in  charge of gathering resources. I had a guy in charge of getting the  backdrop built. I had a guy in charge of building the golden idol. I had a  guy in charge of building the volcano. I had a guy in charge of   I mean,  we had crews. I remember the electronics guy, who was this one who  later robbed Bennett Chapel. I said,    What do you need in terms of  resources?    He was in charge of electronics. He said,    I need two people  of my own choosing and nobody asking me any questions.    He says,    I  need a hundred dollars.    We had three hundred dollars for the budget, so  I gave him a hundred dollars and no questions. He picked two guys, and  God knows what they did, but we had a hellacious volcano.  What did you have as your scene?  The theme was Autumn Shocker. Autumn Shocker. We developed    The  Isle of Autoom Shockoor    and had that sign out front. We had a golden  idol. We had a little village hut, had a tropical isle. We had a volcano  with fire coming out the top. We had this wonderful   some group came  out with this jungle-themed music, very romantic with animals in the  background, so we played that over and over and over as the background  music. It was quite spectacular.  We about lost it. We had a bad windstorm on Wednesday, tore up the  volcano. It was made out of brown wrapping paper, so we had to make a  decision. Thursday morning, we tore it all off and re-wrapped it in a day.  At least we knew how to do it this time. I used fifty thousand staples to  hold it all together. There were a couple days on campus it was very  hard to find a student paper because we needed a lot of paper to stuff in  the backdrop. I later found out the committee in charge of resources  followed the delivery guy and took most of the paper. (Laughter) They   d  25  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  leave two or three but took the rest. By seven in the morning, the papers  were all gone on campus, and by nine in the morning, they were all in  our backdrop painted blue. (Laughter)  So that   s what you   you painted stuff. You painted the paper.  Oh, we spray-painted, and we about pulled the front of the house off, it  got so heavy. You can see it   s kind of sagging in one picture. We put  yellow lights in it for stars. It was spectacular. That   s one of the pictures  I can show you. Not a very good picture, but it   s a picture of it. We won  first prize.  Now, were there any changes that you remember happening while you  were attending OSU? I remember hearing that student housing was a  little tight around 1961,    62.  It probably was. They were talking about building new dorms up north. I  wasn   t too involved in that. Of course, the new chemistry-physics  building was a big deal to me. What were they expanding and adding to?  Boy, I just don   t remember.  Were there any new programs or majors or any key events that you  remember?  There was tremendous pressure on engineering. There was tremendous  pressure on getting people into engineering and because of the Russian  Sputnik thing. There were more female students coming in, going into  that. I should mention, because I think it   s worth mentioning, there were  more minority students and, justifiably so, there always should   ve been.  It was only a few years before that they were not allowed to enroll here.  One of my lab partners was a black guy. We probably got to be lab  partners because nobody else wanted us, but we got along fine. We did  our experiments. We did well, and I enjoyed working with him. He was  a nice guy. We had a good time.  My wife took a dance class before we were married, first semester, and  her dance partner was a black guy from Ethiopia. To us, it was a strange  phenomena. He was very unusual looking. He had very Caucasian  features, but he was as black as anyone I   ve ever seen. She kept saying,     He   s Ethiopian.    I said,    Yes, he   s black.    She said,    But he   s  Ethiopian.    I said,    I don   t care. It   s not a problem for me. He   s not  doing anything.    But he was just so unusual because he did not look like  anyone else I knew. His features were so fine. Of course, since then, I   ve  seen a million people from Ethiopia, and they do have very fine features,  and they have a marvelous history tied back to Judaism and the Ark of  the Covenant and everything else. Haile Selassie was a big visitor here.  26  Larson  Fisher  Recognizing that something is going   I was raised like everybody else I  knew in my life, basically racist, benign racist. It wasn   t a big thing  because I didn   t know anybody black, but the more I met, the more I  realized,    This doesn   t make any sense. Why should I dislike somebody  because of skin color? What has that got to do with it?    By 1967, I  literally took an oath to myself:    I am absolutely through with racism.  No more, ever again, am I going to tell any racist jokes, participate in  racist conversations, or do anything like that because it just makes no  sense.    One of the best decisions I ever made because I would   ve had a  very unhappy career if I hadn   t done that.  Do you think a lot of that had to do with getting out of the town you grew  up in and coming to the university where you had a more diverse group?  Oh, yes, sure. Sure. For the first time in my life, I was exposed to people  from other cultures. It wasn   t just that. It was   I met people from New  York City. One of the first guys I met   first night as a pledge, we   re all  excited. We   re happy, sitting around the fraternity house about nine  o   clock, and a big ol    guy from New York City, (was twenty-four) he  was coming back to college late after the military. He says,    Let   s go get  a pizza.    I said,    What   s that?    He grabbed his chest and goes,    What?      I said,    What   s that?    He said,    Pizza? You   ve never had pizza?    I said,     I don   t even know what it is.    He looks at me and says,    Child, it is  time for your college education to begin. You got any money?     (Laughter) I said,    I   ve got five dollars.    He said,    That   ll do.    They  took me down to a little place across from McCaffrey   s called The Pizza  Palace and ordered a cheese pizza. Said,    We want to start you out  simple. We don   t want to overwhelm your senses.    I ate a slice of cheese  pizza and thought I had died and gone to heaven. The greatest meal of  my life up to that point. (Laughs)  Every semester after that, I celebrated the end of the semester by going  Friday night for the next two years to The Pizza Palace, ordering a  cheese pizza, and eating it by myself, taking about two hours to do it just  because I could while everybody else was gone. They   d gone home on  Friday. It   s been a curse on my life ever since. I don   t drink, but I love  pizza. Without Alex Burke, I don   t know when I   d have found out about  it.  In the fraternity, when we would study in there at night, somebody  started coming around with homemade sandwiches, what they called  poor boy sandwiches. I didn   t know what that was. It was a hoagie loaf  sliced open with some ham and cheese inside with a little mayo or  something. He would come to the fraternity house at ten o   clock at night  and knew they were studying. He   d say,    Anybody need a sandwich?     27  Larson  Fisher  Man, they poured out of there. He sold a jillion of those. I don   t know  who the guy was, but he probably got very rich. Door-to-door hoagie  sandwiches, poor boy sandwiches, because we all ordered those. That  was fun.  I   m trying to remember. Oh, my wife and I, one of the early dates we  had, we actually went to the   there used to be a cafeteria downtown.  You could walk in there and eat, like a Furr   s or something. We went in  there and ordered the usual blue plate special: meat, potatoes, green  beans, a roll. She got a glass of milk, which I thought was kind of  unusual with a dinner meal. Then we go to eat those, and I   m eating  mine like I always do. Then I look at her, and she   s eating all the meat.  That   s all she   s eating. I   m eating a little meat and a little green beans  and a little potatoes and a bite of roll. I look again, and now she   s eating  the green beans. I watched her eat each of those things one at a time, and  then she kind of chug-a-lugged the glass of milk.  I thought I was going to be sick. I thought,    You can   t do that.    She  goes,    What?       Eat one thing at a time.    She said,    Why not?    I said,     It   s just not done. Who does that?    She goes,    I do.    That is the  strangest thing  (Laughter) It almost ended the romance. I just thought,     How can I possibly go with a girl who eats one whole thing?    Mine  have to come out even. A waitress can kill me, filling my tea glass  because I   ve had half of it gone and now the meal is half gone and I   ve  got a full glass of tea and have to catch up. She finally broke the habit  and learned to eat things in some other kind of pattern. (Laughs) I teased  her for years about that whole one thing at a time, Carol eating her meals  like that.  Does the rest of the family do that, too?  Her mother had a lot of digestive problems, and they ate very basic. She  had never eaten gravy. I don   t know if she   d had sausage, nothing spicy,  certainly not pizza. I got to introduce her to pizza, which was great. Her  mother   s idea of the perfect vegetable was wax beans. If there is a more  appropriately named vegetable, I don   t know what it is. (Laughter) I  know it   s a lot of people   s favorite, but it   s not mine.  There were a couple of not-happy things I   d like to mention that  happened while I was in college I thought were, again, those little  moments where something happens that catches you so off guard you  can never ever forget it. My freshman year, I was walking in front of the  Classroom Building, right there north of the Union, on the south side.  There were two young guys talking by the south entrance, west steps. I  remember this so well. One was standing on the step, and one was  standing on the ground. The one standing on the ground had on a  28  Larson  Fisher  cowboy hat and cowboy boots. He was obviously an ag major. As I  passed them, I heard him say,    Yes, well, the doctor told me I got TB,  and I   m going to have to drop out of school.    I go on by, but it so  stunned me, and I got a little further, and I turned around and looked  back at him one more time.  I have never been able to forget that, and I   ve worried about him ever  since. I now know that at that time they could actually treat TB very  effectively. He probably went to the sanatorium in Talihina and got good  treatment and got well and came back to college a year later. I had a  high school football coach, an OSU alumni, Cecil Hinkins got TB while  he was in high school. We gave him a going away present, and all the  teachers cried. We bought him a little TV because he   s got to go down to  the sanatorium. We all kiss him goodbye. He   s dead, you know. He   s  gone. Well, a year later, he   s back. He   s cured. I   m going,    I want the  TV back. If I   d known you were going to get well, I wouldn   t have  donated it  I didn   t want you back as a coach.    He was tough. (Laughter)  But he came back totally cured. I worried about that young guy this  whole time because to hear him say that.  The duplex, the couple next door, when we had a baby and were very  excited, and Lisa was about six months old, they had a miscarriage. It  broke our hearts. I   m thinking,    How do you handle that? How do you  deal with losing what is such a joy?    It wasn   t all fun and games. We  were so broke, oh my gosh  Our pizza at that time was Chef Boyardee  out of the box with only what came in the box. We didn   t add any  toppings. Couldn   t afford them. We borrowed eight hundred dollars  from the Lew Wentz Foundation our last semester, and that   s what we  lived on for an entire semester, eight hundred dollars. It just was tough.  Our folks gave us some groceries and stuff, but I had to focus on school.  I   d switched majors, so I had to take some extra classes. I had a load.  Graduating was a push, but we got through it. I took a class   toughest  class I ever took was inorganic chemistry.  I think that   s the toughest class anybody ever takes. (Laughs)  The teacher graded on multiple response tests. He   d give you a test with  four choices. Any, all, or none may be right, and it was graded right  minus wrong. I remember one question, I got the logic exactly  backwards. I lost four points on one question because two of the answers  were right, two were wrong, and I got them backwards. A typical grade,  average grade, was thirty-six out of a hundred. It was scary, and I had to  have this course to graduate. I had to have at least a C. I   d had the tests,  and I go in to check with him a little over halfway through the semester  and said,    What is my overall grade?    He said,    You   ve got a D.    I go,     How can I have a D? I haven   t had a D on any papers  I   ve had Cs,  29  Larson  Fisher  Larson  but       He said,    You   re in the bottom third.    I go,    I   m in the bottom  third because a third of the class has dropped it. Everybody is flunking  and is running for the woods, so please re-think that. You can   t give me  a D if I haven   t had a D.    I guess he re-assessed it.  Anyway, we got to the last exam. We took that, and then the dean came  in and made an announcement. He said,    I know a lot of you are trying  to graduate. If you make an A, B, or C in this class, you will graduate  with a BS degree in chemistry. If you make a D, you will graduate with  a BA degree in chemistry. If you make an F, you will not graduate, and  you will have to come see me about what we can do about summer  school.    Well, I had to graduate. I was committed to going in the Army.  I had an ROTC commissioning. I had a job at Conoco until I went in the  Army.  There must   ve been thirty of us standing in the hall in the chem-physics  building at ten o   clock on Saturday morning of graduation waiting for  the grade to be posted to see if we   d graduated on the last test. I did. I  got my grade, but there were guys who didn   t graduate. They   ve got  family in town, graduation is at one o   clock, and they find out at ten in  the morning that they   re not graduating. Talk about scary. When the last  semester was over, I was one stressed guy. I went to work at Conoco. I  would be sitting at home and suddenly jerk, thinking,    I   ve got to  study.    Then,    No, I don   t. No, I don   t. I   ve just got to go to work,     which was wonderful.  What did you do? You mentioned you went into the military after your  job. You had a job at Conoco until you went into the Army.  Yes. Went to Conoco, worked in the analytical chemistry labs. I  remember one project we worked on was we were trying to develop a  biodegradable detergent before the government made Conoco develop a  biodegradable detergent, trying to get something that the bugs in a  sewage system would eat before it got in the river. I was helping this  scientist, Dr. E. W. Boyer. I was helping him on that project, running his  samples and testing them. We had a good time doing that. The best  thing, I was able to increase his samples dramatically by adding more  equipment and working   we went from twelve samples a day to forty-eight  samples a day with no loss of time, which was a huge help to him.  Then I went in the Army in February 1963 in the Chemical Corps.  Amazing, degree in chemistry, and they put me in the Chemical Corps.  What a stunning thought. I liked the Chemical Corps. It was fun. I taught  nuclear weapons effects, and we used tear gas a lot, and I got to wear  gasmasks and scare people to death.  You got to still blow things up. (Laughs)  30  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Oh, blew things up. I went to El Paso. They sent me to El Paso, and I  was one of the base chemical officers. You   ve see in the movies where  they take the Army soldiers and put them in a little building and make  them take the mask off with the tear gas in there. I ran that exercise. I  put twenty thousand people through that in two years. I probably  laughed at the first ten thousand because I knew what we were doing,  and we weren   t hurting anybody, but they were just scared to death. It  was kind of an adult funhouse. I would go in and take my mask off and  stand in the corner when we fired it up, so they would see me over there  with no mask on. If I stood still, didn   t touch my face or move around, I  could stand there a long time. They   d say,    Well, it can   t be that bad.  That guy didn   t even have a mask.    So they   d take their mask off and  inhale, and it would make their nose run and their eyes water.  They started sending people to Vietnam, and we started doing the whole  exercise, which included using chlorine gas, and that was very scary  because chlorine is quite deadly. It was used in World War I with great  effect. I had a teacher gassed with chlorine gas and never fully  recovered. That scared me to death, and we were very careful with that. I  didn   t want to kill somebody in a training exercise, so we used a very  small amount. Still, those exercises were threatening, worrisome. I did  that two years. I liked the Army life a lot, but my wife says,    Can we see  if we like civilian life? We   ve never really tried it. We   ve done students,  we   ve done Army, can we try?    I got a job offer at Texas A M to teach  civil defense of all things, so we moved to College Station.  Well, and that was the era where civil defense was     Oh, it was a big deal. Big deal. The fallout shelters, bomb shelters, all  that stuff, I taught all that, and I taught radiation effects and radiological  monitoring. We did all that. I had a great time traveling the state of  Texas, hauling our 250-pound lead container with radioactive cobalt in  it, and the Geiger counters. We   d hide them out in the yard and let  people find them with the Geiger counter. It   s kind of an electronic  Easter egg hunt, (Laughter) worried to death I was going to lose one of  those six tablets of radioactive material. I did that, worked at A M two  years. Then I had a friend tell me about a job at OU, which was closer to  home. We wanted to be near   our parents were older when we were  born. We thought,    They   re going to need us at some point,    so we  moved to Norman to work at OU.  And plus with the grandkids     We had two kids by then. Get them closer to where they can see their  grandparents on a regular basis.  31  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  So you were with the Army for two years and Texas A M     Army two years and then stayed in the Reserve another eight or nine. I  was in the Texas National Guard a couple years while I was at A M.  Then I was in the Oklahoma National Guard another six or seven years  with the 45th Infantry Division and the 45th Brigade. I was a chemical  officer, and then left in, I don   t know,    72,    73, something like that. My  final discharge says it was 1976, so whatever I did lasted until 1976.  So what did you do   you stayed at Texas A M, you came up to OU  and     Worked two years on a contract doing training for the war on poverty.  Used to train neighborhood workers and those kinds of things, traveling  southeast Texas and, well, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, some Oklahoma,  some in New Mexico. We had a big area we took care of. Then did a  couple more years doing training for supervisor in the postal service. OU  got a contract training postal service supervisors. Then I was director of  a security guard training program for the postal service with a three-week  course to train their security technicians.  So how did you go from teaching about chemistry and radiological  effects to doing some of these personnel development training?  Lot of reading, a lot of reading, a lot of talking to the staff. When I went  there to OU, I thought everybody else had been there two years. I found  out later, nobody had been there two months. There were forty of us. We  were all brand new to this program, but it was a brand new program, so  nobody knew anything about it. We read, we studied, we got instructions  from the feds on things they wanted. A lot of it was technical stuff on  how to keep the books. I didn   t teach the financials, how to keep the  books. I spent a lot of time helping local community action agency  directors draw organization charts, saying,    Who is going to report to  whom?    and we   d draw the charts. I   d done that in the Army, also. I  learned a lot of organizational skills in the Army as an officer. You just  learn. You teach yourself. You learn from each other. You go to  conferences; you learn there.  With the postals, I had already been doing management and supervisory  training with the war on poverty, and with the civil defense thing we did  fallout shelter management. We did all that stuff. A lot of it is really fun.  I got to go back to Texas A M about four years ago. The last year I was  there, we did a simulation exercise. We   ll be going to a city like  Arlington, and I   d go in there for six weeks and make a reference library  of all their resources we could find, all the hospital beds and basements  32  Larson  Fisher  and everything. Then we   d go and do like a three-hour simulation where  we   d take all the department heads, put them in a room, create an  artificial emergency, and then put them through a series of events where  they had to solve the problems. We used the resource manual to guide  them. I did that in two or three towns, Grand Prairie, Arlington, and  Sherman. That was a lot of fun doing that. We communicated with them  by internal telephone systems we set up.  When I went back to Texas A M four or five years ago, they now have  a built-in simulation center where they do all that. It   s all computerized.  It is so fancy. They   ve got this fake city, and all these people come. Like  the Dallas top people will come there and run a simulation doing all  these emergencies. Of course, we were covering nuclear weapon thing,  but now they cover everything, tornado, floods    They   ve also got a  plane, a ship, and a city that   s wrecked. They have to go in and do an  emergency rescue. It trains fire departments on how to dig in a rubble  pile. They   ve got rubble piles they   ll restack every night, and then  they   ve got to come in and dig in the rubble pile, remove a dummy that   s  trapped. Going back and seeing all that, thinking,    Gosh, that is so far  from where we were. We were the beginning.    It was really neat to  know I was there at the start and it has evolved into this.  That   s impressive. So you continued to do personnel development and  trainings?  Personnel development, management training, supervisory training.  Finally did that out of the College of Business at OU for a few years and  then a couple of years freelancing doing it. Then got an offer for a job  with the State of Oklahoma to do it on a statewide basis, so I went up,  and I took that job and did that for eighteen years. I had a good time, had  fun. Feel like we had some real successes. You know all these historical  marker signs you see around the state? Those are because of a project a  woman named Mary Brewington had to do because she took a class we  taught. They had to do a project, and her boss   she went to him and  says, as I quote her, told her boss,    I have to do this stupid project.    He  said,    Well, these historical markers in the state are a mess. Do an  inventory. We need to take them down. They   re road hazards.     So she inventoried them all and went to him and said,    Here   s the  inventory. It   s a shame we   ve got to take them down. It   s really  interesting stuff.    He says,    You got to do any more stupid projects?     She said,    Yes.    He says,    Do a plan for upgrading them.    Two years  later, they have been upgraded. Mary Brewington told me   I saw her  one time, and she was all chubby-cheeked. She says,    Fisher, I need this  thing to end. I   ve gained seventeen pounds eating cookies and drinking  punch at dedications. Everybody in this state thinks they need a  33  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  historical marker for something. Every flower club, the Lions Club,  Sertoma Club.    She lost the weight, got a promotion, and the historical  markers are all over the state because of a training program that started  in my office. That kind of thing is very rewarding. We have lots of  those, but that   s one that   s very visible.  I understand, too, that you were national president of     Of one of the organizations, yes.     one of the organizations. Do you want to talk a little bit about that?  Yes, that was the Association of State Training and Development  Directors. People in other states who did what I do, they had a national  group that I got active in. Like a lot of national groups, I thought you  had to campaign hard and work hard to try to be national president. It  was more like,    What sucker can we stick this with next year?    You   ve  been there; you understand. (Laughter) I was national president, and it  was a lot of fun. I loved those people. We had a really good network.  We would trade courses with each other, trade material. When  computers came along, we could trade them electronically, and that  really helped.  If I was going to develop a course on performance appraisal, I would  contact fifteen states and say,    What are you doing on this topic?    They  would send me their materials and vice-versa. Then we   d have national  meetings and bring in top name authorities and speakers to tell us about  what they were doing and how their national programs ran. It was very  good to go to the national meetings and see those. I became very good  friends with a network of people around the country because of that, and  it   s still going on. In fact, I was by the office this morning, and Joyce  Smith was at one of those meetings. They   re still doing it.  Well, and my understanding is, too, you end up doing a lot of training  here     Not a lot, but I do some.     or at least some on campus here.  Yes, when they call me. I   ve done classes up here. That   s fun. It   s fun to  come back. I did it in the old Union before it was remodeled. I   d love to  do one in the new seminar rooms. I did it over here in a building I   ve  never been in, over west of the library. It   s kind of a twin building to  some other one on campus, but I   d never been in that building. I taught a  class in there recently. They   ll invite me up to do a creativity class or a  34  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  problem solving, something like that. I appreciate the opportunity. It   s a  lot of fun.  It   s always good to get alums back on campus, too.  Oh, I come up here     I was going to say, it sounds like you   re up here for the games.  I have been known to drive from Sand Springs through Stillwater just so  I can stop at the Union, get out, go sit on the balcony or under the  balcony over at the Union, listen to the chimes, look at the formal  garden, think about getting thrown in Theta Pond. Like I said at the  beginning, it   s amazing how four years (that   s all I lived here: four  years) could have such an impact on your life, but it was a culture  change beyond description.  I worked with a guy in that cotton mill, a classmate, before my junior  year. We   re sitting there working in the mill, and we   re kind of between  jobs, and he goes,    Fish, I got it made.    I go,    What do you mean?    He  says,    I got it made. I got the wife, we got the baby, we got the trailer on  my folks    property, and I got the job here at the mill. I   m set for life.    I  told him,    You do understand this mill won   t be here in ten years?    He  goes,    What do you mean?    I said,    This whole industry is going to  Brazil or somewhere. This industry died. They   re not replacing these  machines. They   re not going to fix them. They   re just barely making  money now. It   ll be gone.    He said,    No, no, the mill will be here  forever.     I was off six years. I went back four years later. I came home on a bus  from the Army. They were going to take me to Tulsa and then drop me. I  realized we were going through Sand Springs, so I had them stop and let  me off at the mill, and I went over to call my dad at the guard shack. I  asked the guard, who I knew, if I could tour the building because it was  empty. Nobody was there. It was shut down. I went in and went back  there where he and I had been. There is nothing eerier than a closed-down  factory. So noisy, so much life, and just quiet.  I stood there where he and I were and thought about him. I thought,     Wonder what he   s doing now, Mr. I-got-it-made.    Nobody ever has it  made. You better stay current. You better stay caught up. I   m still  learning to use a computer. I use it a lot. I   ve used it since 1982, but I   m  still learning. I   m doing Skype and ooVoo with grandkids and my  daughter in Wisconsin and my grandson in New York. I   m taking online  courses because I have to, otherwise I will become as out of date as a  dodo bird. So I   m still learning, still going, still trying. OSU is the cause  35  Larson  Fisher  of that. It   s the heart of it. This is where I developed a love for it.  Well, you mentioned what a big impact the four years has. What do you  think   I mean, with coming back so frequently, what do you think it is  about Oklahoma that engenders that kind of loyalty in students and  alumni?  Oklahoma is a big state geographically: 250 miles north to south, 400  miles across, and the panhandle is another 150 miles. It is a diverse state  in terms of geography. It is as rare and as wide and as empty out west as  it is overgrown down in the southeast. I mean, we   ve got alligators at  one end and dinosaur remains in the other. You go down to Lawton, and  you   ve got those Air Force bases down there and the military. You go up  to northeastern Oklahoma, and you   ve got a whole other thing up there,  going into Missouri with tourism and fishing at Grand Lake. It is just a  very diverse state.  Plus, when Oklahoma was getting started, the people who came here  were very motivated. I   ve been reading about some of them. Being in a  covered wagon   my grandmother came here in a covered wagon pulled  by oxen, just took forever, and were moved down to Davis and tried to  make it down there. My grandfather helped build the elementary school  in Davis back in 1903. The courage of them, the insane courage to do  that   people died of diphtheria. My grandmother had diphtheria, and the  last twenty years of her life she had to beat doctors off who wanted to  remove her spleen. She said,    You   re not touching my spleen. That   s  what a spleen looks like when you   ve had diphtheria. I   m just not dead.  I   ve still got the spleen. Leave me alone     It   s incredible.  We were a socialist state. Most people don   t know that. We had a huge  socialist population in the    30s. We had a big candidate for president  who did very well in this state. The creation of our constitution, the  hodgepodge that it is, we had two famous people touring the state giving  lectures in every county. Although they never met up with each other,  they toured everywhere telling people about,    Do this, do that.    It   s got  an incredible history, and all that just leads to a desire to know. They  don   t all want to go to college, they don   t all want to be professors, but  you don   t meet many Oklahomans who don   t want to know about what  they want to know, whether it   s duck hunting or carving or hunting or  fishing or whatever. You don   t meet a lot who are just flat dummies.  They want to learn what they want to learn, and they   ll learn it where  they can. If they can   t learn it one place   I mean, you see them.  Drive out here in the ruralest area you can find and go along there, and  you will see a satellite dish because they want to watch the history  channel or something, DIY. They want to learn how to do something.  36  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  Get on the internet. You can find them. They   re all out there. If they   re  not on Facebook, they   re on something else taking classes. They want to  learn the thing they want to learn. They   re a very independent bunch,  and they   re very different. Those southeastern Oklahomans, I don   t even  know if they know what the word farm is. They   ve got so many trees,  they can   t see far, but in western Oklahoma, that   s all you can see,  which is very mind expanding. You get out there    Anyway, it   s just a  very extremely diverse state. Then throw in our wonderful weather  where you don   t know what it   s going to be an hour from now, that can  be incredible. It   s a fascinating place to live. I   m glad the rest of the  country hasn   t discovered it.  Keeps the riff-raff out.  Yes, I don   t need twelve million people living here; 3.7 million is more  than enough.  Luckily, they   re in pockets, so they   re easily avoided. (Laughs)  Yes. Usually, you can get away from them pretty quick.  Now, just looking back from the time you were here at the university,  how do you think the campus and the university as a whole have  changed over the last fifty years?  Well, I think the diversity of the student population   we always had  international students. OSU was big on international students from the  get-go. I met people from all kinds of countries. The diversity within the  state   people have asked me over the years,    Teaching classes for  adults, what   s changed the most?    I say,    Well, the number-one change  is one you probably wouldn   t think of. It   s smoking in the classroom.     Everybody used to smoke all the time. Eighty percent of the population  smoked, and now nobody does, in the class. Second would be women in  the room. That   s been a huge benefit for everybody concerned,  obviously for the women, the knowledge and experience they   re getting,  and obviously for the men, really that they have something to contribute.  It   s human to human. Forget the gender thing. It   s human to human. You  need to take that into account. Then the age diversity, campuses are  finally learning to appeal to people who have left, whether it   s the  learning institutes, the comeback for courses. I even brought one  grandson up here to the Grandparent University, which was a hoot. We  had a great time. Doing those kinds of things, seeing all the diversity,  and then the expansion of degree offerings.  I   d like to share one little story about how important it is that the  scholarships be maintained and the funding be maintained and people do  37  what they can. I know everyone can   t give a million dollars. We do what  we can. We contribute what we can. When I was a high school senior,  there were three of us, all As, straight As from sixth grade on, only  three. Strangely enough, two of us played the piano. One didn   t, but he  was the class president, he was captain of the football team, he made All  District football. We all had straight As. He was an excellent artist, too.  We got to the second semester of senior year, and we decided, or they  decided, somebody decided we ought to take typing. It might be good  for us. Boy, did they not realize how predictive that was, prophetic.  We started taking typing, and it became obvious very quickly that the  typing instructor, his grading system was such that we were not going to  make an A in typing. We just weren   t. The girl dropped it. She wanted to  maintain her four-point. I kept it because I thought,    I think I   m going to  need to know how to type. I think it would be helpful.    The other guy  kept it because he needed the class, too, and he thought he might want to  know how to type a little bit. Well, by the end of the semester, she had  dropped it, took something else, and still had a four-point, and she was  valedictorian. She got a four-thousand-dollar scholarship to Baylor,  which at that time was   I don   t know what that would be worth now.  Twenty thousand dollars? Huge.  I finished second. I got a B in typing. I got an unrestricted scholarship  for twenty-six hundred dollars from Armco Steel Factory there in Sand  Springs, which I could use anywhere, any way I wanted. I used to go to  Whitehurst Hall at the beginning of the semester, walk in, and there was  a very attractive secretary. She   d see me and say,    How much?    I   d say,     Two hundred dollars.    She   d put a check in the typewriter and hand it  to me. That   s all the paperwork I ever had to do.  The third guy, he got a C. He got no scholarship. He got an offer to play  football at Panhandle A M, which he turned down. He went to work for  an oil company in Tulsa, and he never went to college, never graduated.  Later on, he went back and did continue, and he was very successful. He  became mayor of Sand Springs four times, as beloved, and he became a  personnel director for his company. I can   t help but think,    If he  could   ve done that without a degree, what could he have done if he had  been me with a degree and Army commission?    He could have been a  general. He had the talent; he had the knowledge. He could   ve been all  of it. The difference in us was strictly money. He just didn   t have it.  The only scholarships available were the ones we applied for. We all got  the usual two hundred dollars from OU, OSU kind of thing, but we all  needed money to go to school all four years. That twenty-six hundred  dollars got me through paying tuition for four years. He had a wonderful  life, but what a loss to America because what could he have been if we  38  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Fisher  could   ve taken advantage of it? You never know who you might help  with a little donation, maybe twenty bucks, but you never know. So do  what you can, folks.  Yes. Now, we have the advice to the general listeners out there. What  advice would you give to OSU students today or those who are thinking  of going to OSU?  Oh, the usual thing about major in something you love. Do something  you like, but don   t anticipate that this is going to be your career forever.  I got into chemistry and end up teaching motivation classes after going  through civil defense and the war on poverty and postal training and  security guards. Keep your options open. Develop what the Stanford  professor calls peripheral vision. Keep your eyes open. Look around.  See what   s going on. You never know. Some of the most successful  programs I ran working for the state and working for the University of  Oklahoma were because I overheard somebody say some little thing.  I heard a secretary say,    That   s too bad.    I go back and ask her,    What   s  too bad?    and find out they   ve got a hundred people who want to take a  class that they can   t even offer. It   s full. I turned it into a one-day  workshop, charged 285 bucks, and we made twenty-eight thousand  dollars in one day because I heard a secretary say,    That   s too bad.     Keep your eyes and ears open. There   s opportunity, unbelievable  opportunity  They   ll teach you in economics it   s a world of scarcity. It is  not  It is a world of abundance, but you   ve got to keep your eyes and  ears open.  The banquet is spread, but nobody comes. Look around. There   s  chances, but use this education to get you started. You   re just getting a  ticket into the game, but it   s an important game, and you need that  ticket. You may have to get another one or two or three more, but if you  can pursue what you love, fine. If you are at a job you hate, quit. It   s not  a prison sentence. Take a risk. Find something else, or go find something  else and then quit if you   ll feel better. Don   t spend thirty years in a job  you hate.  Is there anything you   d like to add that we didn   t cover or any special  memories or experiences that you wanted to share that we didn   t talk  about?  Probably, yes. Walking on campus, just walking on campus, being out at  nine thirty at night or ten o   clock at night on a moonlit night in the cold  and hearing the chimes. I had a friend who   s a graduate of here who  went to London, England. She   s in England; she   s at Trafalgar Square.  She   s looking at the needle  Nelson   s Column  with Lord Nelson on top.  39  Larson  Fisher  Larson  Big Ben begins to chime, and she said,    I thought,    This reminds me of  Oklahoma State.       (Laughs) You will not believe how these chimes will  embed themselves in your soul. Do that some night. Go outside, go sit  on one of those benches at Theta Pond, and wait until the chimes go off.  Look around in the moonlight and the lights, or just walk across campus,  look at the flowers, look at the gardens.  One of my favorite classes, which I didn   t do all that well in, was a  botany class. We walked the campus identifying trees. We would walk  over to this building, and that was a tree of life, and over here is a  forsythia bush, and down there was an elm tree or whatever. That was a  fascinating class, just to walk around campus. They had deliberately  planted all these different kinds of trees to teach botany. I had to take  one more science class. Enjoy the experience. Have a good time.  You may get your heart broke. I got mine broke for sure my freshman  year, but the next year I got a family out of it. Don   t give up. Don   t quit.  Don   t ever get so discouraged you think life is not worth living because  that ain   t the truth. Hang in there. I don   t know how long they   ll last.  With the internet and virtual learning, all this may be gone someday.  This may be a giant museum on its own where we walk around and  people say,    They used to go to class in these buildings, but now it   s all  computer stuff and you do all the classes at home.    I hope not, but  certainly moving that direction. The growth of online learning is  exponential. I   ve had to learn to teach that way because I   ve got no  choice. Enjoy it. Enjoy yourself. Whatever you   re doing, enjoy it.  Well, thank you very much. We appreciate your...  Well, I probably overwhelmed you.  No, no, it   s wonderful, thank you.  -------  -------
