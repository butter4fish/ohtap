Story_ID: 203178
Speaker 1: Now let's begin talking about your mother, starting with your mother's name and where she was born and where she grew up, that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Annie Delphine Evans Primm and everybody called her Delphine.  She was born in North Carolina and grew up in Fayetteville, North Carolina.  Did you also ask about--
Speaker 1: No, and did--
Speaker 2: --the year of her birth?  Okay.
Speaker 1: No.  No.  And just what kinds of stories did she share with you about growing up as a girl in Fayetteville and her life as a girl?
Speaker 2: She enjoyed her life there.  She was--she lived right across the street from Fayetteville State Teachers College [Fayetteville, North Carolina], which it was called then; it's now Fayetteville State University.  And so I think, you know, her exposure to sort of education was really big because my grandmother was a teacher.  And, you know, I think she, you know, grew up in the church and was a very good student and played the piano and, you know, had a promising career in music.  And she was actually the valedictorian of her high school class, but I guess the sad part of that was she should have gotten a special award that was given to the valedictorian every year, but it was given to a girl who was light-skinned the year she graduated, which was really heartbreaking for her and, you know, sort of an example of some of the intra-racism that existed back then.
Speaker 1: And how did she and your father [HistoryMaker Dr. Beny J. Primm] meet?
Speaker 2: My mother was working in, I guess, a pharmacy as a soda jerk, I guess that's what they called them.  And my father, who was in the area as a soldier at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, was a paratrooper, he came to that establishment to get a soda.  I think his favorite was a lime rickey and my mother made it and at the time, he was so taken by her, you know, her beauty and her manner and grace that he told her right then and there that he was going to marry her and, of course, she didn't believe it, but he did.
Speaker 1: And did your mom ever talk about just what life was like at Fayetteville--in Fayetteville during that time?  You know, just what a typical day was like for her, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't remember her really talking about that, you know.  I, I get the sense that, you know, she was a disciplined person and my grandmother [Annie Mae Dupree Evans], you know, was a teacher and I think they had a very sort of organized lifestyle of, you know, going to school and, you know, coming home, you know, doing homework, probably helping with chores and practicing the piano and, you know, having dinner with the family.  She had a sister, an older sister and, you know, my grandfather [Ambrose Evans], of course, so I think it was a happy time.  Probably, during--she was born in 1930, so I guess that was right after the [Great] Depression or right in the middle of it, really, so I don't think it was any sort of lavish living by any means.  But, you know, the--you know, I don't think they were destitute either, you know, so I guess they lived as comfortable as anybody did around that time.
Speaker 1: I think, and I could be wrong, but I think the first time we talked you had mentioned to me that your mother was very fashionable.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --a little bit about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she really had a lot of style.  She enjoyed, you know, wearing nice clothes and I think initially, my grandmother even made them for her.  You know, that she would see styles that she liked in magazines and my, you know, grandmother would sew them.  But I remember, you know, pictures of her, you know, dressed in a really stylish, you know, fitted suit with just the perfect shoes and her hair done, you know, just right.  So, you know, she really could have been a model, you know, she was that stunning.
Story_ID: 203179
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your father starting with his name and where he was born.
Speaker 2: My father's name is Beny and that's with one 'n,' Jene Primm and he's a physician, so he's [HistoryMaker] Dr. Beny [J.] Primm.  He was born in Williamson, West Virginia and at the age of twelve, he moved to the Bronx in New York [New York] and, you know, spent the rest of his sort of growing up in that setting.
Speaker 1: And your father went to medical school in Switzerland?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How did that come about?
Speaker 2: After my father had been in the [U.S.] military, he had the G.I. Bill and was able to go to the school of his choice.  And initially, he looked into the University of Heidelberg in Germany [sic. Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany] because believe it or not, he was a German major in college at West Virginia State College [West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia].  So, you know, his being able to speak German was an asset in that setting, but for some reason, you know, things didn't work out there.  And a friend of his who had grown up with him in the Bronx was already at the University of Geneva [Faculty of Medicine, Geneva, Switzerland] where apparently, you know, it was a good environment there and he encouraged my father, you know, to apply and he got into that school, but did not speak French.  And--but he was bold enough to still go to medical school there without knowing French and learned French while he was learning medicine which I can't imagine what that was like, but somehow he got through it and was successful.
Speaker 1: And did he ever say, were all the classes taught in French or were some taught in English?
Speaker 2: No, they were all taught in French and all of the books were in French as well, so that was a tremendous learning process.
Speaker 1: And what were your mother's [Annie Delphine Evans Primm] thoughts as a fairly new bride, what were her thoughts about moving out of the country?
Speaker 2: I think on the one hand she was really excited about that and, you know, living in Europe, I think that was exciting for a girl who probably hadn't been, you know, many places outside of, you know, the State of North Carolina.  She did go to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] for undergrad so she had at least been to Nashville, Tennessee.  But it was a real opportunity to go to Europe and to go to Switzerland, but I think she probably thought it was, you know, a little--at least a little bold, if not outrageous that my father would attempt to do something like that.  And I think she might have been a little worried that things might not work out, but she stood by him and fortunately with her support, he was able to be successful.

Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your ancestry, [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Annelle B.] Primm?  Do you know if you came from free people or slaves?  How far back can you trace your ancestry?
Speaker 2: I've never really traced back that far.  I'm assuming that we did come from slaves though because it was never impressed upon me that we were from free people, and that's a pretty big deal, so I probably would have known about that if that were the case.  I think on both sides of the family, you know, like many other African American families, we have mixed with American Indian [Native American] groups and probably some white too, which is not unusual either, but yeah.
Speaker 1: And what can you tell us about your grandparents?  Did you have the opportunity to know and spend time with your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Yes, I knew all four of them.
Speaker 1: Let's start with your paternal grandparents, starting with their names.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My paternal grandfather was named Gerome Oliver Primm--wait a minute, I'm sorry, that's my uncle's name.  George Oliver Primm was my grand--paternal grandfather.  My paternal grandmother was Willie Henrietta Martin Primm.  And should I tell you a little bit about them?
Speaker 1: Please.  Please.
Speaker 2: I'm pretty sure that George Oliver Primm was born in West Virginia and he was an undertaker by profession and was very successful at it.  And after moving from West Virginia to New York when my father was twelve, you know, he resumed his business in the Bronx [New York, New York] and then later on in Mount Vernon, New York and, you know, was very successful there.  My grandmother was a teacher by, you know, by profession and taught, you know, I think the first through the eighth grade.  In fact, taught all of those children the different grades in one room and actually, my father [HistoryMaker Dr. Beny J. Primm], you know, was one of her students very early on.  And if I'm not mistaken, my grandmother also got her master's degree.  So, you know, she was, you know, actually very sort of insightful about the importance of education both for herself and for my father because one of the reasons that she wanted to move to New York was because of the education that was provided there and the fact that, you know, the school system was integrated and she felt that if my father and his brother [Gerome Primm] were educated in the same way that whites were, that that would be an equalizer, in terms of their opportunities and I think she was right about that.  My maternal grandparents, my grandfather was named Ambrose Evans, I'm forgetting his middle name.  And my maternal grandmother was named Annie Mae Dupree Evans.  My grandfather worked for white people, basically.  I think he, you know, was a chauffeur and not really a butler but, you know, used to assist families with, you know, various things.  And very easygoing, very likeable, personable person and we liked to play with him a lot.  You know, he was very permissive with us and, you know, let us comb his hair and do all different things.  So we really enjoyed his good-humored nature.  And my grandmother was a teacher and she also got her master's degree and, you know, had sort of a rough life early on in her childhood but, you know, really persevered.  You know, walked miles to go to school and, you know, used to do--to clean houses for white people and was just really determined to achieve educationally, really enjoyed teaching and was a much loved teacher.  And also, I think from a sort of societal point of view, took it upon herself to be supportive to young women who were, you know, looking to achieve their educational goals.  And with Fayetteville State University [Fayetteville, North Carolina] being right across the street from my grandparents' home, she used to take in young women who were attending college there, giving them a place to stay that was very home and family-like and being supportive of them.  Really, she was a mentor to them and many of them became really extended family and we sort of treated them as a cousin or a sister.

Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Annelle B.] Primm, what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest memories would be when I was in [Geneva] Switzerland.  I stayed there until I was four years old and I remember riding my tricycle in front of the apartment building where we stayed and, you know, showing my mother [Annie Delphine Evans Primm] how well I could handle the tricycle.  But unfortunately, the time that I remember the most, I--while she was watching me, I sort of lost my balance and fell off the curb and broke my arm and so that sort of sticks out in my mind.  I'm not sure that I actually remember being in a hula hoop contest at that time, when I was three, but I think the pictures sort of help me recall that time.  My father [HistoryMaker Dr. Beny J. Primm] entered me in a hula hoop contest and, you know, there were many contestants that were much older than me, some even teenagers, but believe it or not, I won.  And it was on television and, you know, quite, quite a spectacle that this, you know, little black child won this hula hoop contest.  And so there are pictures of me in action.  I guess the funny part was that I had been so indoctrinated by my father about what I should do in order to win and that is, you know, keep on going and don't stop no matter what that when the contest was over, I was still hula hooping.  And they had to sort of stop me because I was so intent on keeping on going, so that was a good memory.
Speaker 1: I thought you had shared a story with me also about your name, who you were named after.  I think you were named after friends of your parents?
Speaker 2: Yes, actually a combination of my mother and my godmother.  My mother's first name is Annie, even though she went by Delphine.  And my godmother, who was also in medical school with my father was named El-Dorado Johnson [Dr. Eileen El-Dorado Johnson], so my mother and she took the first syllables of each of their names and put it together.  You know, took the Ann from Annie and the El from El-Dorado and sort of French-ified it, if you will, and turned it into Annelle, so that's how I was named.
Story_ID: 203182
Speaker 1: Can you share with us special memories of holidays and things like that?  What were holidays like in your house?
Speaker 2: Holidays were really delightful for us, especially Christmas.  You know, many families got together.  My grandparents [George Oliver Primm and Willie Henrietta Martin Primm], my uncle on my father's [HistoryMaker Dr. Beny J. Primm] side, Uncle Jerome [Primm] and his family, and another part of our extended family was Aunt Dottie [ph.] and Uncle Lionel [ph.].  [GY2]And Dottie was actually like a cousin, I don't think she was really related to my father, but they grew up living in the same sort of apartment or duplex and, you know, they became extremely close and so for years we, you know, saw her almost like blood kin.  And she would come over with her sons and, you know, other extended family members would come together and we would actually have family shows, competitions where each family would prepare some songs that they would sing or dramatic presentations or, you know, even dance.  And prior to Christmas, we would practice together.  My mother [Annie Delphine Evans Primm] would play the piano and my sisters [Martine Armande Primm and Jeanine Bari Primm] and I would, you know, either play the piano or sing together.  And even my father, who's not big on singing, you know, would, would sing 'The Christmas Song' that Nat King Cole [GY3]made popular.  So it was just a really great time and a lot of fun.  I mean, even though the competition was pretty tough at times, it was really all in fun and something that all of the families looked forward to year after year and something we sorely missed after my mother died, when I was nineteen.  And really, ever since then, Christmas and, you know, the holidays haven't been, you know, quite the same.  We haven't had quite the same magic, but I'm trying to bring that back.  I still play the piano a little bit and, you know, we've begun to do a little singing.  No competition, but--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, just singing together.
Speaker 1: And did your--could you tell us--give us your siblings' names in their birth order, including yourself?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I'm the oldest and I'm forty-eight.  My sister, Martine Armande Primm is my middle sister and she is, I think, just about to be forty-three.  My youngest sister is Jeanine Bari Primm and she's forty-one; she's the youngest.
Speaker 1: And did your mother pass along her musical talent to her daughters?  Did you all play the piano growing up and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We all took piano lessons from an early age and we can all play, you know, at least a little bit and we can read music.  And fortunately, that's something that I think is such a gift because while I don't really play to entertain others that much, I mean, I'll do Christmas carols, that's fine, but music and piano has been therapeutic for me.  And because I have an ear for music, if there are songs that I know that I want to play, I can pick them out and play them.  And so, I've been able to pass that along to my daughter and sometimes she and I play together.  My sister, Martine, actually plays quite a bit and is preparing for a recital now, so that was a gift that my mother sort of planted in us and it's still growing.
Story_ID: 203183
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Annelle B.] Primm, tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up.
Speaker 2: Sights, I guess the sight of the home where we spent most of our time from when I was the age of ten, when we moved to New Rochelle, New York.  And I think that the house that we lived in and, you know, fortunately my father [HistoryMaker Dr. Beny J. Primm] still lives there so unlike other people my age whose family may have moved away from their original family home, we still have that.  So that's, you know, a symbol to me of, of growing up.  I guess, the smells that remind me of growing up: smelling pork chops frying which is, you know, not something that I prepare in my own family now.  You know, sort of, you know, you're not supposed to eat that many fried foods and so, you know, that remains a--sort of a delicacy and sort of a distant memory, but I remember how good it used to taste and how good it used to smell cooking.  And as far as sounds, maybe the sound of the piano.  My mother [Annie Delphine Evans Primm] playing the piano or me practicing, that was a happy sound.
Story_ID: 203184
Speaker 1: And what was daily life like for you as a small girl like, you know, a very young girl during the elementary school years.
Speaker 2: Well, of course going to school and I was a very serious student and probably a little shy.  And, early on, from early on, I was the only black child in my class and one of few black children in the whole school that I attended when we lived on Long Island, New York in Huntington [New York].  And that was really at the very beginning of school integration and we were one of few black families in the part of Huntington where we lived and so, you know, that meant that I was integrating the school.  And actually, most of the other children that were in the school were in the special education classes and--
Speaker 1: Did it ever seem odd to you?  Did you ever wonder well, why, why aren't those black kids in class with me?
Speaker 2: I did wonder that and it was just one of those things.  I mean, you just had to accept it and I never understood why.  And in my classes, I was supposedly the smartest kid in the class so that was sort of a unique position to be in.  Being the only black child and I guess that it just sort of was an unexpected position for a black child to be in, especially back in those days.  But, you know, I was a serious student. I would come home and do my homework, you know, pretty religiously and, you know, practiced the piano and, you know, help out with the dishes once I got old enough to do that.  You know, probably watched TV a little bit, but not, not too much of that.  And, you know, I wasn't a big, you know, play--I didn't play with dolls that much.  I mean, I wasn't the tomboy either but, you know, very interested in nature.  I mean, I would spend hours in the woods that were near the house that we lived and, and certainly couldn't do that now, it would be pretty dangerous.  But, you know, I would explore, you know, the different moss that I would find, the berries or different sort of rocks.  And actually where we lived, I think, was near where Indians [Native Americans] used to live so I found arrowheads and, you know, all sorts of different types of stones and things.  So I think I was more of a solitary sort of child.  I mean, I did have friends and, you know, did have some fun too but, you know, probably more indoors than the average child.  You know, but I really--I enjoyed that sort of thing.  Sometimes my mother [Annie Delphine Evans Primm] would say, "Come on, let's go shopping," and early on, I really, you know, didn't want to do that.  I would just want to stay home.  I might write letters to my friends or something like that, but later on, I did get the hang of --
Speaker 1: I was going to say certainly, as you got older.
Speaker 2: I got older and enjoyed shopping and my mother would say, "Come on, do the dishes so we can go to Loehmann's," so, you know, that was--
Speaker 1: Was Loehmann's one of your favorite stores?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was one of my mother's favorites and, you know, I came along with her and, you know, really enjoyed that.  I mean, there's a certain culture to Loehmann's with the, you know, sort of open stall dressing room and, you know, it was that way back then and, and it's still that way, that way today.  But, shopping for my mother and one of her dear friends who often used to come with us, Helen [ph.], it was like a sport almost.  So--but it was a fun way to sort of keep up with styles and stuff.
Story_ID: 203185
Speaker 1: And how did you get along with your sisters [Martine Primm and Jeanine Primm] growing up?  What was that like?
Speaker 2: I think I got along with them well, for the most part.  Probably, if there was any conflict it was mainly between me and my middle sister.  We had very different personalities.  She was much more, you know, outgoing and fun-loving and, you know, not as sort of serious and studious as I was, so we might have some conflict sometimes but, you know, we were very supportive of each other.  And I remember once in elementary school when I was being chased by some kids who didn't like me, my middle sister, Martine was, you know, running behind them and telling them, "You leave my sister alone."  And so she really, you know, stood up for me and, you know, we've been, you know, good, good to each other.  My youngest sister [Jeanine Primm] and I were extremely close, but it was more of a maternal sort of relationship on my part.  You know, she always looked up to me and I looked after her as the big sister.  And then when my mother [Annie Delphine Evans Primm] died, my youngest sister was twelve and so my maternal instincts were really needed then and, and actually, you know, I've been a surrogate mother for her ever since then.  And I guess in some ways, it was like when I was nineteen as if I had a child of my own because I really did have to look after her and make sure that she was okay.  So I've done that happily and we're extremely close today.
Story_ID: 203339
Speaker 1: --Let's talk a little bit about elementary school.  We had started talking about elementary school.  What were some of your favorite classes?  Do you remember some of your teachers?
Speaker 2: Yes, I remember one teacher, in particular, and I'm forgetting his name right now, maybe it will come to me, but he was in a wheelchair.  And I remember this was in fourth grade, and we were talking about slavery and the [American] Civil War and that was really tough, you know, being the only black kid in the class at that time, so that's quite a memory.  I remember in that same class that around Thanksgiving, we had a visitor, one of the congressmen that represented the district that the school was in came to visit.  And he gave me his sort of placemat or something that was a decorative thing and, you know, I guess he was being nice to the only black child in the class.  In fifth grade, Mr. Brown [ph.] was my teacher, and he was just a really excellent teacher and, you know, I remember learning a lot from him.  You know, he was sort of a--not a disciplinarian, but just very organized and--but very fair and, you know, remember learning a lot from, from him.
Speaker 1: What were some of your favorite subjects?
Speaker 2: Subjects, I really liked math a lot; I liked science; I liked social studies too.  I think those were my, my favorites.
Speaker 1: And during the elementary school years, did you have dreams and aspirations?
Speaker 2: I think I knew early on that I wanted to be a doctor, and my father [HistoryMaker Dr. Beny J. Primm] actually took me on house calls with him, you know, as young as five.  So I got to see, you know, early on, you know, what it was like working with people and, and in providing healthcare.  And I think my first thought was actually to be a psychiatrist or, you know, someone who listened to people and helped--
Speaker 1: Why do you think--
Speaker 2: --them with their problems.
Speaker 1: --that was?  Like what prompted that?
Speaker 2: You know, I'm not really sure what did.  You know, maybe I knew early on that I didn't want to be the sort of physician that, you know, had to deal with a lot of death and dying or had to do surgery, you know, and I did not enjoy those sorts of subjects in, in medical school.  But I think that helping people, you know, listening to them, sort of understanding their situation and putting myself in their shoes was something that just, you know, came naturally to me.  So I did deviate from that for a while.  I thought I would be interested in obstetrics and gynecology, because I was just so fascinated with the whole birth process and, you know, it just seemed so magical in many ways.  I think once I faced the reality of what life was like for an obstetrician, the unpredictability of it, you know, when babies actually come, I changed my mind later on.
Story_ID: 203340
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit now about--actually, did you and your family attend church growing up?
Speaker 2: We did, but we--
Speaker 1: What were those experiences like?
Speaker 2: Well, we attended so many different denominations, actually.  Yeah, I was christened Lutheran and then when we lived in Long Island [Huntington, New York], we went to, I think, an Episcopalian church and then when we moved to New Rochelle, New York, we attended a Presbyterian church, or at least I did.  My mother [Annie Delphine Evans Primm] grew up Baptist and, you know, continued to go to Baptist churches, you know, every once in a while.  She wasn't, you know, every Sunday churchgoer, but she did make sure that, you know, we went to church.  And she got us connected with a church in New Rochelle [New York], the Presbyterian one that had a really strong youth group and so, you know, I found that to be a lot of fun and also educational because on--during the school year, one afternoon a week I would go to religious instruction.  I guess sort of similar to catechism that the Catholic young people went to.  And the--our teacher was, I guess, a Ph.D. sort of candidate, very intellectual sort of person who, I guess, was in seminary at the time and, you know, taught us some very deep philosophical type things.  I think, you know, really much more advanced than junior high school or high school kids would be learning but, you know, really opened our minds, I think to some important concepts.  And this was reinforced on Sundays because the way the services were structured, you know, there was a sermon that incorporated current events and then after the sermon, people who were in the congregation were invited to, you know, ask questions or make comments.  And they actually had a mic in the aisle of the church where people could, you know, come and, you know, talk about different issues.  So it was really, I guess, sort of a very progressive and open sort of environment; not your usual religious experience.  And, you know, with the youth group, you know, we went on camping trips and, you know, ski trips and they had drama groups and, you know, there were all sorts of good things going on.  So I made a lot of great friends and I think generally had a positive religious exposure in that environment.
Story_ID: 203341
Speaker 1: Do you remember when the family made the move to New Rochelle [New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That was in 1966, and I was ten years old at the time.
Speaker 1: What did you think?  Were you excited about this new place or were you a little hesitant about leaving?  What were your thoughts?
Speaker 2: I was excited about it because, you know, one good thing was that the school system there was much more integrated and so--
Speaker 1: And did you know that?
Speaker 2: I did know that.  And so I think, you know, it was a chance to interact with more, you know, peers that looked like me so that was a positive change.  And also, we moved next door to the same person that my father [HistoryMaker Dr. Beny J. Primm] heard about University of Geneva Medical School [University of Geneva Faculty of Medicine, Geneva, Switzerland] from, his childhood friend from the Bronx [New York, New York].  And so we lived next door to him and his family and he had a daughter three years older than me, Debbie [ph.], who, you know, we're still close friends today.  And so I had a buddy next door, you know, who was a little older and, of course, that's always fun to be able to hang out with someone a little older than yourself.  And, you know, she and I were extremely close, so it just opened up a whole new world for me.  We lived on a block where we had, you know, neighbors on either side and the place where we lived in Huntington [Long Island, New York], you know, the houses were spread apart pretty far so there really wasn't the same sense of neighborhood or a community that we had in New Rochelle, so that too was a welcome change.
Speaker 1: And can you describe your street and do you remember the name of your street?  Well, your father still lives there so--
Speaker 2: Yes.  The name of the street is Colonial Place, and it's in a part of New Rochelle that borders New Rochelle's Little Italy, if you will, a--you know, an Italian neighborhood.  And the--when we moved there the block was integrated but, you know, had already begun to turn and become more African American, and I think on the main part of our street, probably 80 percent of the families were African American.  So, you know, we lived pretty much on a black block and there were children my age and, you know, we all played together (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was it mainly like professional African Americans who worked as professionals?
Speaker 2: Yes, middle class.  It was sort of a middle class street and comfortable homes.

Speaker 1: What was junior high school like?
Speaker 2: Junior high school was good.  I had to take a bus to get there and walk some.  It was called Isaac Young Junior High School [sic. Isaac E. Young Middle School, New Rochelle, New York].  You know, it was integrated but, you know, the African Americans and other non-whites were in the minority.  You know, I was a cheerleader there and, you know, was involved in sports, as well.  You know, I ran some track.  And I was in the advanced classes and had a really close friend, Virginia Dietrich [ph.], who's still a friend, you know, after all these years, but we were all in this--we were in the same classes together.  And, you know, I excelled there and even got to play the piano with the choir and, you know, played flute in the band for a while.  I sort of deviated a little bit from the piano for a minute and tried the flute, so I--it was a great experience.  I think we had an excellent education there.
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of your teachers from junior high school?
Speaker 2: Oh, let's see.
Speaker 1: If not, then that's okay.
Speaker 2: I think Mrs. Bass [ph.] was my math teacher.  I hope I'm not getting that mixed up with high school, but she--oh, Mr. Rotendaro [ph.], my science teacher.  And he was--seemed to be like a [U.S.] military man, you know, very upright and very disciplined and he transmitted that discipline to us in our dissection of frogs.  And we used to have a weekly science newsletter that the class used to get, and I don't know if it was SRA [Science Research Associates] or I don't even remember what the name of it was, but our assignment every week was to read this newsletter and paraphrase it.  You know, be able to put--to write it in different words, our own words, what it was that we had read.  And, of course, we did not enjoy doing that at all.  It was really considered to be a pain, but what a gift that was to, you know, learn the skill of, you know, putting something into your own words.  So I, I hope that some of my classmates realized, like I did, you know, how useful a skill that was for us to learn in eighth grade.  So he's really a star among the teachers I had there.

Speaker 1: And during junior high school [Isaac E. Young Middle School, New Rochelle, New York], that--those years, did you--what were some of your dreams and aspirations?  Did you still think that you wanted to be a doctor or were you kind of straying from that a little bit or what were some of your career thoughts?
Speaker 2: I still wanted to be a doctor, even then, and some of my summer work experiences were related to the sciences and to health.  I worked in the lab one summer and other summers, I worked at a camp service assisting a physician in doing the camp physical exams, at least registering the young people who were coming in and taking their height and weight and that sort of thing.  It wasn't until I was in college and my mother [Annie Delphine Evans Primm] was very sick, that I began to have second thoughts about medicine as a career.  And I got interested in business in--particularly in advertising and I thought, "You know, gee, that would be fun, it'd be a creative sort of endeavor to be in the advertising field," but, you know, when I told my father [HistoryMaker Dr. Beny J. Primm] that I wanted to pursue, you know, a degree in business he just hit the roof.  He said, "You know, I don't have any contacts in that arena," and, you know, "You're so sensitive and those people will eat you alive.  You know, you'll never make it in that world, you know, it's so, so cutthroat."  He was probably right about all of those things.  And at the time, though, I think what I was responding to is, you know, watching my mother, you know, she had cancer and she was very sick and, you know, knowing that, you know, she was probably dying.  You know, just the thought of, you know, spending my life doing that kind of work, I, at the time, I just didn't think I could, could hack it.  But, you know, eventually, you know, I came back around.  My mother told me, "Look, you know, if you really want to do this business thing you should.  You should do what you want and, you know, don't be pushed into medicine."  But I think that over time I realized that, you know, my interests were more, you know, in the health field and a caring sort of profession and that it really made more sense for me to pursue that and that's what I ended up doing.

Speaker 1: Let's move onto high school; what was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: New Rochelle High School [New Rochelle, New York].
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like in high school?
Speaker 2: My experiences were really great in high school.  This was a high school of three thousand students and, you know, it was a very diverse sort of high school, in terms of the, you know, the demographics of the students.  And it was on a beautiful campus.  It had two lakes in front of it and, you know, a beautiful stone building and it was a public high school, you know, very high quality education there.  I was a cheerleader again and, you know, I did well in the classes.  I wasn't at the top of my class or anything like that but, you know, I did well and participated in different activities, you know, student government and, you know, I'm trying to remember what other sorts of groups that I was in.  While I was in high school, I won an award, the Michael Schwerner Award, which actually came as a surprise to me, but Michael Schwerner was one of the students and was a white guy who was murdered in Mississippi [Freedom Summer Murders].  He was, you know, one of the sort of civil rights activists and he had gone to New Rochelle High School and, I guess, his family must have put money together for an award for the student who helped most with race relations or something like that.  And, you know, I had always had friends--
Speaker 1: (BRIEF INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: So in high school, what were some of the things that you did during your spare time and that kind of thing?
Speaker 1: Let's see, what did I do in high school?
Speaker 2: What did you enjoy doing?  Did you enjoy reading?  Shopping?
Speaker 1: Well, I enjoyed reading a lot.  And I liked writing letters to my friends.  I mean, it was really a form of creative writing for me, and I actually miss writing--handwriting letters now, you know, with the--
Speaker 2: Email and--
Speaker 1: --with email and computers and stuff.  But, you know, playing the piano and, you know, I would sort of improvise and, you know, I would find a lot of joy in, you know, making up songs or, you know, picking out popular--picking out the notes, you know, to popular music.  I guess getting together with friends--dancing; I always loved to dance and still do.
Story_ID: 203345
Speaker 1: What were some of your thoughts about college?  Were you thinking about where you wanted to go to college?
Speaker 2: Yes, and, you know, there was a lot of influence from my next door neighbor friend, Debbie [ph.].  And she went to Harvard-[Radcliffe College; Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and I--because she was there, I think I was really interested in going there.  And, you know, I went to visit her a few times and really got a sense of, you know, sort of college life in Boston [Massachusetts].  And when I was coming up, you know, Boston was the place to go to college; everybody wanted to--or at least all the black kids were flocking there.  So--and it was something I looked forward to, I think, having the freedom of, you know, not having close parental supervision.  And, you know, not that my parents [Dr. Beny J. Primm and Annie Delphine Evans Primm] were extremely strict, but I think, you know, looking forward to being more independent was something I was happy about, so--
Speaker 1: You know, one thing I didn't ask you, [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Annelle B.] Primm, was what kind of community was New Rochelle when you moved there?  So I guess that was like in the mid to late '60s [1960s]?  How would you describe--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the community of New Rochelle?
Speaker 2: Well, New Rochelle [New York], at that time, was really a suburb of New York City [New York], and it's actually very close to the New York City line; it's probably less than five miles from the Bronx, New York, the northern part.  New Rochelle actually borders Long Island Sound, so there's a beach there but, you know, much of it is very suburban.  But over the years, it has become more urban, you know, sort of with the creep or the sprawl of New York City.  So I think some people have called it a slurb, you know--well, not a slurb, but whatever the combination of a city and a suburb is.  And, you know, there are some pockets of poverty there and some, you know, immigrants that have come from different places--
Story_ID: 203346
Speaker 1: You were thinking about going to Harvard[-Radcliffe College; Harvard University, Cambridge, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what were your parents' [HistoryMaker Dr. Beny J. Primm and Annie Delphine Evans Primm] thoughts about that and what--did they have any concerns about you going to Boston [Massachusetts] or what were some of their thoughts?
Speaker 2: They--my parents weren't worried about me going to Boston; II really don't think so.  I mean, they were definitely gung ho about me going to college.  That was a definite.  There was no question that I was going.  I did get an opportunity to go to University of Virginia in Charlottesville [Virginia].  I had attended a college fair and talked to an African American woman who was a recruiter for the university and when I told her about myself she was, you know, very excited and really wanted me to come.  And I did apply, and I was accepted to a special program for scholars and, you know, we would live in this special dorm and, you know, have lots of resources and, you know, a full scholarship, but I also was accepted to Harvard and, you know, I really wanted to go there.  I think my father would have loved if I had taken the full scholarship at University of Virginia, but I think he knew what going to Harvard meant to me and what it might also mean for the future so he found the money to pay for it, so I was fortunate in that regard.
Story_ID: 203347
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like at Harvard[-Radcliffe College; Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Harvard was an interesting experience.  When I came there as a freshman, that was the first year that women were allowed to stay in the dorms at Harvard Yard and that was a big deal.  You know, there was a lot of changes going on I guess with feminism and so forth.  I ended up living at Radcliffe [College, Cambridge, Massachusetts] anyway and I think actually had a strong identification with Radcliffe as the college that I was accepted into because I was a woman.  You know, all of our classes were coed [coeducational], but I think that sense of being part of a women's college was important to me and, you know, an important part of my development.  You know, sometimes at Harvard it was a little tough.  You know, many of my classmates had attended, you know, some of the best preparatory, you know, private schools in the country and, you know, they were really way ahead.  They had had courses very similar to what was being taught in--at Harvard and so, you know, while I was, you know, struggling with freshman chemistry, you know, they were just sailing through.  And, you know, I think some of the professors were a little impatient with, you know, people like me, but I--you know, I didn't think it was my fault that, you know, I was at a disadvantage having gone to, you know, a public high school that was a good one, I thought.  But anyway, it was difficult to compete with the level of academic preparation that I think some of the other students had had, including some of the black ones too.  But I think what made Harvard the special experience that it was for me was the sense of community that the African American students created and some of the mentors and one of the, I believe assistant or associate deans [sic. assistant dean of freshmen], David [L.] Evans, you know, very nurturing, very supportive, very cohesive.  And so that sense of family, you know, I think really carried us all through and, you know, we--many of us have maintained relationships over the past--gee, it's almost twenty-five years now, a pretty long time since I finished; I finished in 1976, so--and actually, when I went to Harvard, and this is somewhat unusual, I was sixteen, so I was one of the youngest students in my class.
Speaker 1: How was that?
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: Did you skip a grade?
Speaker 2: No.  I started kindergarten when I was four and I didn't really skip a grade, but I finished high school a year early.  I should have finished in '73 [1973], but I had an opportunity to finish early.  I had done all the required courses and, you know, taken the Regents Exams [Regents Examinations] which are mandatory in New York State schools.  And so I guess I was in such a rush that I, you know, made arrangements to graduate early.  So, you know, I don't know if that was such a good idea.  At the time, I was, you know, excited to be in college and, you know, some of my friends were older, you know, like Debbie [ph.], my next door neighbor.  So I did have this sense of urgency, but I probably could have used an extra year or so at home in the nest of my family but it worked out okay--
Story_ID: 203348
Speaker 1: Unfortunately, my first week in college [Harvard-Radcliffe College; Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], my father [HistoryMaker Dr. Beny J. Primm], after dropping me off there with my mother [Annie Delphine Evans Primm] and my sisters [Martine Primm and Jeanine Primm], he came back a week later to tell me in person that my mother had been diagnosed with breast cancer and had to have a mastectomy.  So as much as I tried to deny that that affected me during college, it really did.  I mean, it was always--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --in my mind.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And, you know, she died my--the first semester of my senior year and, you know, that was very difficult.  And the previous year as a junior, I arranged to take off, essentially, the second semester so that I could take care of her because she was going back and forth to chemotherapy, and there was really no one available to take her.  And, you know, there was a lot of, you know, back and forth about whether I should be able to do that, but--
Speaker 2: Back and forth with--
Speaker 1: With the--
Speaker 2: --people at Harvard?
Speaker 1: --administrators--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at Harvard, you know, weighing whether or not that was appropriate for me to do or whether I should, you know, withdraw for a period or take a leave of absence, but I was able to, you know, get the work from my professors and, you know, work on papers and that sort of thing and, you know, come back for exams and it ended up working out okay.
Story_ID: 203349
Speaker 1: So, we were talking about the climate at Harvard-[Radcliffe College; Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] for African Americans; what was the climate like during that time?
Speaker 2: Well, of the African Americans who were in my actual class, we were about 10 percent of the students--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --and I think there may be a thousand students in the class of '76 [1976] or about one hundred or so African American students, and this had been around the time when there was a really big push to increase the diversity at Harvard, and so I think we were a product of that.  And this was the year after students had occupied one of the buildings.  I don't know what the protest was over; racism, or the Vietnam War, or something.  You know, this was a time of great protest and, you know, civil rights sort of issues, and so, you know, I think people were very politically conscious and, you know, politically active and vocal and, you know, there was a black student union and then--but there was also parties that were, you know, a lot of fun and--so, you know, I was a part of that.  I mean, I wasn't one of the student leaders necessarily, but, you know, definitely a part of the fabric, and yes, there was a black table in the cafeteria.
Speaker 1: --in the cafeteria, yeah.
Speaker 2: And that was a source of consternation to the white students and some of the administrators, and I think nowadays we know that, you know, there's nothing wrong with there being a black table or any table where people who have things in common or who identify with each other congregate--
Speaker 1: There's a football table, there's a--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: You know, cheerleading table, et cetera.  It's just that it's a little bit more obvious.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: But that cohesiveness is actually very healthy and, you know, very therapeutic in a place where you can very easily feel alienated and isolated, so I'm really grateful, you know, to that sense of community that we had there.  And at the same time, I had white friends and friends of diverse backgrounds too, so I think it was a very positive environment in many ways.
Story_ID: 203350
Speaker 1: And how were you coping with your mother's [Annie Delphine Evans Primm] illness.  What kinds of things were you doing to help you cope with her illness?
Speaker 2: I'm not really sure what I did to cope.  I mean, I was fortunate to have, you know, close girlfriends and Debbie [ph.], you know, my childhood friend that lived next door when we were growing up, was there at the time, and, you know, she was very helpful.  I mean, she knew my mother very well, and you know, even called her Aunt Del.  And when my mother died, I basically lived with Debbie.  You know, she had an apartment, and she had a roommate, but, you know, she had enough room for me to stay also.  So, you know, I had a sense of family away from home with her.  So that was very much a part of, of my coping with things.
Speaker 1: How were your sisters [Martine Primm and Jeanine Primm] doing?
Speaker 2: They were doing okay.  You know, I think my youngest sister [Jeanine Primm] really, you know, took the greatest hit from it; and being the youngest, she was the closest to my mother, and, you know, she was just devastated and, you know, she really wasn't doing well in school after that, and, you know, wasn't really combing her hair.  And, in fact, you know, because she hadn't combed her hair in a while, you know, I was still away at college, I discovered when she came to visit me that, you know, the back of her hair was completely matted and couldn't be combed.  And so it was at that point that, you know, I decided she should have a short natural [haircut] that would be easy to manage and, you know, she wouldn't have to worry about, you know, getting hair done so often.  You know, I also got my haircut too at the time.  Fortunately, that was in vogue, you know, to have a short natural, and looked really really cute on her.  So, you know, that was actually one of the first sort of acts of leadership that I took in terms of, you know, what needed to happen, you know, for her to be able, you know, to take care of herself and--so I think it was hard for my sisters and, you know, hard for my dad [HistoryMaker Dr. Beny J. Primm].  Fortunately, he and I had always been very close and so, you know, that was nothing new, and, you know, I think he knew that he can count on me to help out.  My sister, my middle sister, ended up going to a boarding school right after that.
Speaker 1: She was like a junior in high school?
Speaker 2: She [Jeanine Primm] was twelve when my mother died.
Speaker 1: Your middle sister was?
Speaker 2: Well, my middle sister [Martine Primm] was sixteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So she was about to finish high school, so, you know, she didn't really have to change venues.  You know, but my youngest sister did.
Speaker 1: Now, who went to the boarding school, your middle sister?
Speaker 2: My youngest, my middle--my youngest sister went to boarding school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was in Virginia, so when I went to Howard [University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] for medical school, it was fairly close and so I can keep in touch with her and actually my middle sister went to Howard undergrad, so we were all in the same area and I was able to sort of keep an eye on them.  So that worked out well.
Story_ID: 203351
Speaker 1: Big contrast in terms of campus makeup, Harvard[-Radcliffe College; Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Howard [University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So what did you think about Howard when you first got there?
Speaker 2: I thought it was great.  I mean, I think to have lived in a city like Boston [Massachusetts] where I was very much a minority, and there were some parts of town that I definitely was not supposed to go and, you know, you could feel some of the hostility when you encountered whites there outside of Cambridge [Massachusetts] which was, you know, a different environment than the rest of Boston [Massachusetts].  Coming to Washington [D.C.], the contrast was, you know, immediately felt driving down the street, and you know, to the right and left of you would be black drivers.  I mean, there were black people everywhere and so it was not--it was the usual situation to be surrounded by African Americans and that was really comforting, you know, not to be in the minority.  And at Howard Medical School, you know, it was really the best environment for me to be in for medical school because, you know, your academic peers were also your social peers and the people that you studied with you also partied with and there was a nice flow, you know, between those poles.  So it made medical school as enjoyable as it could be for me, because, you know, the social life was integrated, you know, with the work life and sort of made it fun.  And also, the professors seem to have a particular investment in the students doing well, because, you know, they can identify with us as if we were their family and so, you know, I had really good relationships with some of my professors and, you know, still bump into some of them today.  And the relationships that I made with my fellow classmates, you know, they too continued because, you know, the majority of African American physicians have been educated at the historically black [HBCU], you know, medical schools.  So I feel fortunate to have had that experience.  Very validating.
Story_ID: 203352
Speaker 1: So while at Howard [University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.], what were you thinking--what type of doctor were you thinking you wanted to be?
Speaker 2: Initially, at Howard I thought I would be an OB/GYN physician [obstetrics and gynecology] and, you know, I just had this fascination with the birth process, but it was interesting when I did my rotation in obstetrics, every single one of the deliveries except for one was a cesarean section, and I was not big on surgery and knew I didn't want to do that, and so that turned me off, as well as the hours that, that obstetricians have to keep and, I guess, now, you know, with their malpractice being so high, I think I made the right choice.  So--
Speaker 1: How did you make the decision about psychiatry?
Speaker 2: You know, I'd always loved psychiatry, my psychiatry courses in medical school, and enjoyed reading the psychiatry text and, you know, took them to bed with me as if they were a pleasure book compared to some of the other text that were really, really rough to get through.  But the psychiatry was actually enjoyable, and when I did my psychiatry rotation at Walter Reed [National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland], I just loved it.  I mean, it came naturally.  I enjoyed, you know, listening to the patients, talking with them, understanding their life stories and some of the psychological challenges they were dealing with.  But still, I did not choose psychiatry outright for residency.  I was going to do flexible medicine or surgery, which would have given me a little more time to make a decision about what I would ultimately do.  But what happened was--I mean, I'll tell you why that is, because really psychiatry at that time and maybe still now a little bit, has been a thought of as a second class specialty in medicine, and you know, people don't think you're a real doctor if you're a psychiatrist.  And we had to apply for what is called the residency match which is really like a lottery where you make a list of the programs that you want to apply to and be considered for, and then you go around doing interviews and those programs in turn rank you according to how much they want you in their program, and a computer puts together the best match between your top choices and the different program top choices.  I didn't apply for enough places, really, in order to get any match, and so on match day when everybody was finding out where they were going to be, I did not match and what that meant was that I needed to go meet with a dean and find out from the book of programs that did not match all of their spaces--where might I go?  So this was an opportunity for me to choose psychiatry because in the sort of unmatched space book, there were many psychiatry residency programs that had openings.  Some of the best programs; Harvard [Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts], Yale [School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut], Baylor [College of Medicine, Houston, Texas], et cetera; and Johns Hopkins [School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland]  which had an opening, and I ended up talking to the director of residency training and my dean spoke on my behalf.  They were impressed with me, and so I ended up going into psychiatry after all, which was really the best decision for me.
Story_ID: 203353
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the program you co-founded at Johns Hopkins [School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland] in 1985; COSTAR.  Can you tell us what that's an acronym for and basically what the program was?
Speaker 2: COSTAR stands for Community Support Treatment and Rehabilitation, and that was a program that actually I had an opportunity to design when I was in my last year of fellowship at the School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins, and it was designed to meet the needs of severely mentally ill people who typically would not be able to avail themselves of conventional outpatient psychiatric treatment.  That is coming to a clinic or a doctor's office for their care--
Speaker 1: Just due to lack of access, funds--
Speaker 2: Well, due to mainly their illness being so severe that, perhaps, they didn't know that they were ill or they would tend to be hospitalized for long periods of time in state hospitals or because they didn't want to take medication, you know, wouldn't follow a treatment plan and, as a result, would end up being unstable.  Sort of what we call the revolving door going in and out of the hospital, in and out of the emergency rooms and sometimes on and off the street because many of these people, especially after being discharged from state psychiatric hospitals, would become homeless.  Especially, you know, if they lost contact with their families and, you know, didn't have much support.  So this program was designed to do outreach, to actually engage these people in their home environment, wherever that might be.  So we did a bit of home visiting and we, you know, covered different aspects of the patient's life.  Of course, their psychiatric symptoms, you know, making sure their housing was stable, assisting them with activities of daily living, recreation, even helping them get employment if, you know, they were ready for that or had potential for that, and helping them with their families because--well, helping their families directly because, you know, it can be difficult to manage a family member who has a severe mental illness, and so we were also supportive to the families.  And, you know, this was a program that, you know, was modeled after others in other parts of the country that had been successful, but really, COSTAR was the first time that this model of care had been applied to an urban setting, like, you know, urban Baltimore [Maryland] which is where Johns Hopkins Hospital is located where, you know, there's a great deal of poverty.  A very high percentage of people of African American decent and all of the associated problems that go along with poverty, like unemployment, and substance abuse, and crime and so forth.  And so we were dealing with these individuals with these mental needs in a very challenging socioeconomic environment.
Story_ID: 203354
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Annelle B.] Primm, when did you first begin to notice or did you always know--some of the disparities of mental health when it came to African Americans and perhaps other minority groups and the majority.  When did you begin to notice some of the disparities?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I noticed it very early on; even in medical school [Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland], and I actually had an opportunity to do some home visiting while I was there doing my family practice rotation and got a chance to write about it.  And I think really wherever I've traveled to, you know, I've seen how differently, you know, people of color end up living, you know, their, their living environments and of course their health is very much associated with that.  So, you know, I think the time that I spent in the [Johns Hopkins] School of Public Health [Baltimore, Maryland] also made me aware of that because the focus there is not so much on the one-on-one doctor/patient relationship, but on looking at populations and what a given population experiences.  And so as I began to think about African Americans, you know, their having a disappropriate amount of poverty that actually puts them at risk, you know, for a number of health problems and including lack of access to healthcare and even for employed people who may be uninsured or under-insured.  So my consciousness was raised about that, really, throughout my medical and public health training, and I saw it firsthand as I, you know, worked in the community psychiatry area and did the home visiting.  You know, I also recognized that the people were not being diagnosed with the appropriate diagnosis and, you know, depression was often overlooked or that people had waited so long that they had suffered many negative consequences that they receive the treatment that they needed, and so, you know, I really felt strongly that I needed to do something about that, because those negative consequences were not minimal.  You know, substance abuse, you know, was often connected with untreated depression.  People self-medicate and we know that in these sorts of communities that the availability of substances like alcohol, you know, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week and, you know, other drugs, you know, illegal drugs are, you know, too available.  And so this is a set up for not only having a psychiatric illness and a substance abuse problem, but also putting people at risk for infection diseases like HIV/AIDS [Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome] and hepatitis, you know, and other sorts of problems.  And it really just creates a cycle.  Sort of a vicious cycle of leading people into crime and incarceration and the cycle continues, so I felt really strongly about that.

Speaker 1: And why do you think there is such a stigma in the African American community about seeking out mental health help or assistance?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think that being an African American in this society where we are already devalued as people, you know, to take on another stigmatizing label of having a mental illness which unfortunately is, you know, still looked upon negatively compared with other health problems.  That it's sort of a double whammy to be black and, you know, have a mental illness and, you know, some people refer to having a mental illness as being crazy, and I think that the--
Speaker 1: What's the difference?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that mental illness is just a more appropriate term.  I think crazy has so many negative connotations that I just try not to even have that word in my vocabulary, and, you know, try to impress upon people that a mental illness is a bona fide illness just like diabetes or hypertension, and when you use the word, crazy, you know, it just has so much negative baggage with it that you don't see someone who is regarded as crazy being someone with a health problem.  You think of that person as bad or, you know, just not a worthy person, and so--and that's why I try to educate people not to use that word and, you know, to refer to mental health and mental illness.  That's more appropriate, because that's the way we need to regard these diseases as being on a par with other health problems and to be treated as such.  You know, people would not hesitate to get diagnosed or treated for diabetes or high blood pressure.  Why should they avoid such treatment for a bona fide illness like a mental illness, you know, like depression, for instance?  So I think that's a barrier, you know, for African Americans and another barrier is the great importance of spirituality and faith in your lives and many people feel that if they were to admit to have a mental health problems that that would mean that somehow they were not praying hard enough, that their faith wasn't strong, and if they were really a person of faith that they would pray hard and everything would be all right.  And so, I think, you know, people would carry a burden of guilt if they were to, you know, divulge having mental health needs.  You know, while being religious and being strong spiritually is a really strength or benefit, I think it can sometimes have some negative effects on a person's freedom to seek mental healthcare.  So I really do advocate for people to find a way for mental healthcare and spiritual and religiosity to go hand in hand and have been fortunate to work with pastors and other religious leaders to be knowledgeable and understanding about mental health needs.  And so we can really help each other improve awareness and treatment of mental illnesses.
Story_ID: 203356
Speaker 1: And one of the ways you're reaching the African American community is through a videotape series called 'Black and Blue.'  Can you tell us a little bit about that and how it came about?
Speaker 2: Yes.  'Black and Blue: Depression in the African American community' grew out of my awareness of lack of awareness of depression as an illness in African Americans.  I was fortunate to have some patients of mine who were willing to be filmed talking about their own personal experiences with depression as a syndrome, a cluster of symptoms, and I'd asked each of them about their experience with it, how it affected their mood, how it affected their sense of self, their self-esteem, and how it affected their sense of well-being.  In the video, I also included a pastor--a Baptist pastor, who, you know, talked about the fact that it's important for people to seek health for their mental health needs, there's nothing wrong with that in God's eyes.  So I think that because the people who spoke on the video have had depression, have experienced it, that there's a certain sincerity or genuineness that comes across to the person who's watching; whether they're African American or regardless of, ethnic or racial background.  I think it really goes a long way to educating people regardless of their literacy level because, you know, we often hand out all these pamphlets and written materials that are often written at a level much higher than the level that the average person reads, which is supposedly sixth grade.  So using videotapes for public education, and, in particular, public mental health education is really effective, and I've used it as a tool and, you know, many different environments; in churches, in schools, even to educate health professionals about, you know, when--examples of African Americans who have are experiencing mental illness.
Story_ID: 203357
Speaker 1: And have you met any resistance?  Have you ever come across any from the religious community who have said, I think if you do have a strong faith and a strong sense of spiritual, you can overcome this without seeking assistance from a psychiatrist?
Speaker 2: I have come across religious leaders who really resist this whole idea, and I think many of them see mental health professionals as being in competition with them-that if we somehow get to their members, we'll steer them away from the religious community.  But the way that I think is important to approach people who, you know, initially have resistances really to have an exchange; have them educate us as mental health professionals about what their notions of mental health is from a spirituality and religious point of view and visa versa, for us to educate them about, you know, how we see mental health and mental illness and, you know, really trying to find a meeting of the minds, because, you know, I think the risk for religious leaders is that often people will come to them to seek help when they're having mental health needs, and, you know, maybe the average person who has some, you know, psychological issues they're dealing with, the pastor or the religious leader could handle that with some, you know, general counseling.  But once the mental health needs rise to a level of, you know, actual pathology and mental illness, it's usually over the head of the average religious leader unless they've had some specialized training, and certainly some of them have and could handle it.  But they don't want to be in a position of getting sued, and so I think that the idea of us collaborating, you know, that is the mental health community and the faith community is really the way to go so that, you know, we can help each other help people who have mental health needs and spiritual needs.  I think they're needs for both and that they can coexist side by side.
Story_ID: 203358
Speaker 1: And do you feel like change is on the horizon or change is taking place in terms of African Americans, more particularly, seeking help for mental health issues or do you still feel like there's still needs to be heavy level of education taking place?
Speaker 2: I think there have been some improvements in the willingness of African Americans to seek help for their mental health needs.  At the moment, though, the majority of people who receive help for mental health needs are receiving it in the primary care setting, you know, by their family physician, where it may be a little more acceptable to, you know, receive treatment in that setting as opposed to, you know, going to a psychiatrist or going to a mental health center.  I think there's still that fear of that label.  But it is improving somewhat and, you know, but there's still room for more improvement, and I think the way that we really need to focus are educational efforts is on, you know, what the illnesses are, you know, what are their manifestations helping people recognize them so that they will know when it's time to get help and they will know where to go to get help, you know, both for themselves, their family members, and their coworkers.  So I think this is really an important sort of public health effort.
Story_ID: 203206
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Annelle B.] Primm, you know I wanted to ask you, we talked about depression, but what are some other mental health issues that people may have and not really recognize that it's a mental health issue?
Speaker 2: Well, one really common mental illness is anxiety disorders, and anxiety disorders can come in different forms.  It's general--generalized anxiety disorders, social phobia, panic disorder which is really common and can be very frightening to people; post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD], obsessive compulsive disorder [OCD].  Those are the main types, and I think that after African Americans have been underdiagnosed with anxiety disorders and, you know, many of them are suffering with these sorts of disorders and don't know they even have an illness and don't know that they could be helped with, you know, psychotherapy or talk therapy and/or medication.  So, you know, it can really debilitating.  Some people, some people end up commit suicide as a result of their anxiety if it gets really really severe.  So, I think, we need to do a better job at educating people about anxiety disorders, you know, as well as depression.  Schizophrenia is another illness that's much less common.  It occurs in about 1 out of 100 people, and you know, we see this illness across the world and, you know, the symptoms of schizophrenia are probably a little more easy to recognize that a person has an illness, you know, with sort of strange beliefs and hearing voices, and --
Speaker 1: Like paranoia?
Speaker 2: And paranoia.  Although, the paranoia is sort of a tricky symptom, because some people talk about African Americans needing to have healthy paranoia in order to survive in our society where, you know, there's racism and, you know, you sort of have to be careful and on guard and sort of vigilant about things.  And, as a result, you know, we find some African Americans who really have a mood disorder like depression, have been misdiagnosed as having schizophrenia just by virtue of having some paranoid beliefs, which in our situation, are actually realistic and not really unusual for us to be concerned that somebody may be trying to do us in, if you know what I mean.  So that's the tricky part with schizophrenia that there's been a lot of misdiagnosis in the African American community, and I think educating mental health professionals to be very careful in their diagnostic process, especially for African Americans--I think that's getting better, but you know, schizophrenia is a sort of illness that is important to recognize early and treat early, so that you can have the best outcome.  And if an African American family, you know, concerned about, you know, mental illness, and, you know, having that diagnosis in your family.  If they avoid getting their loved one to some treatment, it could have some negative effects later on.  So really the earlier you recognize it, the earlier treatment can begin, the better long-term outcome so that the person can, you know, be productive and function and even, you know, work because that's, that's certainly possible, but I think that's one of the reasons why we really need to educate the African American community about the whole range of mental illnesses, so that we can have the best outcome and be as productive as we want to or need to be.
Story_ID: 203207
Speaker 1: And do you think that Hollywood [California] is helping your case a little bit, or is it hurting it?  We see lots of shows; fiction and reality shows, involving psychiatrists and that kind of thing and, you know, and a lot of books, you know, and a lot of Hollywood stars see their place in that kind of thing.  So what kind of impact do you think Hollywood and celebrities are having on people seeking out mental health assistance?
Speaker 2: Well some of the shows on television, for instance, you know, are a bit sensational and may not really do mental illness and mental healthcare much justice, but I think that celebrities who talk about, you know, having had mental health problems and having gotten help for them is good; and that may actually encourage people to get help.  There's a videotape that I have seen, another one on depression, that includes the model, Beverly Johnson and the professional golfer, [HistoryMaker] Calvin Peete, and they both talk about their personal experiences with depression as did Jennifer Holliday, the famous gospel singer.  She talked about her experience with depression, in essence, in another educational videotape on depression.  So I think that when a celebrity discloses that, you know, they have depression or they've had a mental illness, this really helps people to see, well, you know, this is a famous person, and they have depression and they overcame it, and so if I have depression, then, you know, I guess that's okay.  I should just get some help.  So I think this can go a long way to reducing stigma, and so I'm glad and really grateful, you know, to those people who, you know, bravely stepped up and are talking about their experiences with mental healthcare.  I think they can really help people overcome their fears of getting help.
Speaker 1: And for some, it almost becomes somewhat trendy.  You know, there are a lot of people who openly talk about their therapist and that kind of thing.  And so for some, it has become somewhat trendy for some groups.  Is that a concern or have you noticed that, as well?
Speaker 2: I haven't really noticed that so much among African Americans--
Speaker 1: Right.  No, and it's not really among African Americans.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think we have a ways to go before seeing a therapist will, you know, become trendy.  But, I think that--
Speaker 1: I have to take a quick break.
Speaker 2: (BRIEF INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: So we were just talking about how--and it's not very trendy among African Americans, but it is somewhat trendy among--and especially, a lot of young people, as well.  Are you finding that in terms of African Americans that there are some differences of opinion with younger African Americans?  Are they more likely to seek help?
Speaker 2: I haven't noticed that yet, and I think, you know, among young people really as a group they are sort of a microcosm of the larger, you know, African American community and so, you know, they get many of their views--they inherit some of their views from their parents and so I think if a young person is a member of a family in which getting mental health needs met is a priority, then it'll be okay for them.  But I find that those young people and those families where it's accepted, it's out in the open, it's eagerly sought after-they're in the minority still.  So we have a ways to go.
Story_ID: 203208
Speaker 1: What do you find in terms of economics?  Do you find that African Americans that are a little bit affluent and a little more financially stable, are they more likely to seek mental health services than those who are not?
Speaker 2: I think that education and socioeconomic status does have some bearing on whether people feel comfortable about seeking help.  But whether people see the value in seeing a mental health professional seeing more value in it than stigma.  Of course, people who are affluent can afford to see someone in a private office where there isn't a big banner across the entry way saying, you know, mental health clinic.  And so that may make it easier, you know, having more disposable income to spend on, you know, very expensive therapy sessions where you may have insurance that only covers half of the visit.  You know, there are a very few people who can do that, and so I think that, you know, having the financial wherewithal makes it a lot easier to seek and it makes it more likely that a person will understand and have a appreciation for, you know, the value of mental healthcare as opposed to the stigma.
Speaker 1: You know, I wanted to go back to something like what you had said before at medical school.  That some had--some view psychiatry as almost second rate to some other--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --medical fields.  But, you know, it's interesting and speaking from a layperson's point of view, whenever you think of the psychiatrist, that's the person you always think of who is making a lot of money because you hear--you know, you have this unfortunately this vision of, you know, this person who these people come in, lay on the couch and talk for an hour, and you know, spend five hundred dollars for that hour.  So is that perception a little skewed?
Speaker 2: The perception of psychiatrists, you know, being very wealthy and having people, you know, pay all this money to see them is--it still exists to some extent, but the way that healthcare has changed in the last couple of decades, you know, managed care and, you know, other forces to drive down the cost of healthcare, I think a lot of that has gone by the wayside.  You know, while there is still people who practice psychoanalysis, which, you know, is very expensive and sometimes people will see them three and four and five times a week.  You know, there's not as many people practicing that form of psychotherapy and, you know, a lot of people--only wealthy people can afford that.  You know, most insurances won't cover it and, you know, the average American, including middle class Americans, you know, can't really afford it.  So I think that sort of perception, you know, it still exists, in reality, but much less so.  And so, there is a lot of psychiatric treatment that ours in clinics using not only psychiatrists but social workers, psychologists and other mental health professionals.  So it's a changing scene, and really psychiatrists, they are not among the highest paid specialties; they are among the lowest paid.
Story_ID: 203209
Speaker 1: How has--is the field of--so how has the field of psychiatry changed in terms of more African Americans going into this field.  Are the numbers where you like for them to be or do you think they can be a little higher?  What do you think?
Speaker 2: The numbers of African Americans choosing psychiatry as a profession--they need to increase desperately, especially, child psychiatrists where there's a lack across the board.  I believe at this point maybe two to three percent of psychiatrists are African American.  And when you compare that percentage to our proportion in the population, which is about 12 or 13 percent, there's a big gap there and, you know, as you may know some people if they're going to seek mental services from a psychiatrist, they want that psychiatrist to look like them.  And so we are nowhere near at a place where, you know, any African American who wanted treatment could get it from an African American psychiatrist or other type of mental health professional for that matter.  And we have come to the realization that some of the disparities in healthcare and mental healthcare exist because of the lack of diversity of the healthcare profession.  And so there have been recent reports from the commission by [U.S.] Congress [Sullivan Commission on Diversity in the Healthcare Workforce], the Institute of Medicine [IOM; National Academy of Medicine, NAM], and very recently the Sullivan Report [Missing Persons: Minorities in the Health Professions]--that has documented that in order for health disparities to be eliminated that we must increase the diversity of the workforce and that also pertains to mental health professions too.
Story_ID: 203210
Speaker 1: What advice do you have for African Americans who are interested in pursuing a career in psychiatry or some other aspect of mental health?
Speaker 2: Well, I would encourage who have such interest to, you know, do as much reading as they can about these issues.  They may have interest in the social sciences, which certainly has some bearing on the field of psychiatry.  They may have interest in, you know, in math and science.  Those are some of the traditional backgrounds out of which we come, but certainly psychology, another important area; social work.  These are pathways to the mental health profession.  So I would advise people to do reading on these subjects, to take courses in school when they can in these subjects to help prepare them.  And also to find a mentor, someone who is in one of those professions, whether it be a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a social worker, or even a nurse practitioner, because there are some nurses that specialize in psychiatry, as well.  And, you know, shadow them, see what they do, you know, get turned on by their activities and their involvement, volunteer with a mental health advocacy organization.  You know, we have the Black Mental Health Alliance [BMHA] here in Baltimore [Maryland].  There's the National Alliance of the Mentally Ill [sic. National Alliance on Mental Illness, NAMI] and National Mental Health Association [NMHA; Mental Health America, MHA].  Those are some examples, and by joining those organizations, you can become knowledgeable about mental illnesses and the sorts of treatment and services and resources that are available.  And so this can go a long way to expose people to what's out there and getting them prepared to take those steps to enter these professions and the training for them.
Story_ID: 203211
Speaker 1: And, [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Annelle B.] Primm, when you look back at your life, what stands out the most to you and why?
Speaker 2: I think that, maybe, sort of going back to the hula-hoop--that my father's [HistoryMaker Dr. Beny J. Primm] encouragement to, you know, to keep on going and "Don't you stop."  I think that has guided me--just the perseverance, even in the face of adversity, to just, you know, keep on keeping on, to keep on going--that, you know, that you continue to grow and even though you may fall down, you know, you can get up and certainly that has been my experience.  There are things in my life that, you know, I thought were maybe not a failure, but a disappointment or, you know, something that I thought was a bad thing that turned out to be good.  You know, for instance, not matching with the residency program, and you know, not really being sure about psychiatry and, you know, I ended up going to an excellent training program, and you know, being able to stay on faculty for many years and, you know, a lot of potential, you know, and opportunity and I think at this point with that perseverance and, of course, the, you know, support and love from my family and friends and colleagues I think the job that I have now is the best job that I could have in the country, really, for the sorts of things that I'm interested in.  And so, I'm grateful to have been able to keep on going and to be blessed with the resources and support that's sort of allowed me to do these things--
Story_ID: 203212
Speaker 1: --You're still very young and will do many, many, many other things; how do you think you'd like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as someone who found a way to help people, you know, even if it was just one person; but, you know, hopefully, more than one; who gave to people, you know, whenever she could and hopefully made the world a lot of the--this part of the world a better place in that, you know, people know a little bit more about themselves, about their health, about their mental health and could, therefore, you know, be able to live a quality life, which of course then has a domino effect on their families and on their community.
Story_ID: 203213
Speaker 1: What do you think your legacy will be?
Speaker 2: I think that the 'Black and Blue[: Depression in the African American community]' video is, you know, one sort of enduring contribution that people can see and that--bringing the illness of depression out of the closet and out of the shadows for black people and making it all right to talk about it, and to be still respected as a person is a contribution and what I'd like to be remembered for.
