Story_ID: 608461
Speaker 1: Well, you learned from your mom.  Let's talk about your mother.  Tell me her name, when she was born, and where she was born.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My mother is Donna Marie; Mitchell [Donna Mitchell Plummer] was her maiden name.  She was born in Kansas City, Kansas as well in 1942.  And what else did you ask me, I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: No, I asked you where she was born.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Did she share any stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean my mother grew up in a family, she was the only girl in a family of three boys.  And she was pretty much, she was spoiled, she says.  (Laughter) And she grew up in Kansas City, Kansas, and during that day, Kansas City, Kansas, the community that she grew up in was a predominantly black community, but it was, they didn't have a lot of racial issues.  So, she grew up in an environment that was very supportive and encouraging.  She knew a lot of her relatives and a lot of friends in the immediate area; they all went to school together.  So it was sort of like a, yeah, kind of a Mayberry type environment.  And there were black professionals around.  There were people who were, had their own businesses.  They all went to the same school, so it was a pretty close knit, you know, quiet community.  They didn't have a lot of racial issues or concerns.  It was kind of a safe environment for them.
Speaker 1: And tell me about your mother's education.
Speaker 2: My mother went to school--elementary school, grade school, middle school, and high school in Kansas City, Kansas.  She went to the University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas] for her graduate, her undergraduate degree.  And then later she became a teacher.  And then later on she got her graduate degree at the University of Missouri-Kansas City [Kansas City, Missouri], I believe it was.  She wanted to be, I think a dental hygienist or a dentist.  But ultimately during that time she was I guess counseled to become a teacher, and so she became a teacher and was a teacher for twenty-five, thirty years before she retired.  But she still works with the school district doing counseling, and on special assignments and substitute teaching, still at Kansas City, Kansas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me about her and your uncles and--she was the only girl, so tell me about your uncles.
Speaker 2: She was the only girl.  I had three uncles.  One was younger than my mother, and the other two were older than my mother.
Speaker 1: What were their names?
Speaker 2: Lephus Mitchell [Lephus Mitchell, Jr.], Tyrone Mitchell, and Kevin Mitchell.  Lephus and Tyrone Mitchell are both deceased.  Lephus worked as a janitor for many years in the school district.  He was hearing impaired, and that was the only job that he knew.  But he was very loved in the community, and was very quiet and kept to himself, and took care of my grandmother [Marie Harrison Mitchell] for many years.  And Tyrone Mitchell was an accountant.  He also went to the University of Kansas and went to local elementary and middle and high school in Kansas City, Kansas, and then died about fifteen or twenty years ago.
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about--
Speaker 2: Kevin Mitchell, I didn't get Kevin.
Speaker 1: Kevin, okay.
Speaker 2: Kevin Mitchell is still living.  He is retired, and lives with my grandmother in Kansas City, Missouri.  He worked for many years as a sales executive for different companies.
Story_ID: 608462
Speaker 1: What type of person is your mother [Donna Mitchell Plummer]?  I mean, what are her characteristics that you love about her?
Speaker 2: My mother is one of the most generous and warm people that you could ever meet.  She is, has a teacher's heart, so to speak.  She's always taking care of people and trying to fix situations and help people out.  Even to this day when I call home there's likely to be someone staying in the house, some young child or student that she's attached to that she's trying to help out, or some family that she's working with.  She's just a very giving person, just likes to help people.
Speaker 1: What characteristics did you get from your mother?
Speaker 2: Probably a sense of caring for other people and being, you know, concerned about others.  I think I'm a little bit more cautious than she is about who she lets into the house.  (Laughter) But she, you know, she's just very much a giving person, and I think I picked that up from her; hopefully as much as she is, yeah.
Story_ID: 608463
Speaker 1: Tell me about your grandparents, your mother's mother and father.
Speaker 2: My mother's mother is Marie Mitchell [Marie Harrison Mitchell], and her father is Lephus Mitchell, Sr., Lephus Mitchell, Sr., I don't remember a lot.  He died when I was in high school [Sumner Academy of Arts and Science, Kansas City, Kansas].  What I do remember of him is that he was seen as sort of a, he was very much a community person.  All of the young men in the community, you know, congregated at his home.  He started a baseball league and a football league in the community, and was always known for helping out with the young men in the community and just kind of being a person who they could go to.  And even, I do remember when he died that that was the most astounding thing, how many of the young men whose lives he had impacted that came back to the funeral.  My grandmother is still living, she's ninety-six, and she's in pretty good physical health.  She still has some mental, you know, challenges, just from memory, short term memory.  But her long term memory is quite remarkably still intact.  And she was a housekeeper for many years and ultimately went to college [Kansas City Kansas Junior College; Kansas City Kansas Community College], and did get her degree in a college in Kansas City, Kansas, and became a social worker.  And during my formative years, I recall her being a social worker.  She worked with the local social agency, placing children into foster care homes, and then retired and has been sort of just a retired woman in the community.  She did some things in the community for a while, but most lately she's just pretty much at home.
Speaker 1: And your grandfather?  What did he do?
Speaker 2: He worked for the railroad for many years, and the postal company.  And then he was, he did not go to school.  He was a retired military man, and his [U.S.] military service brought him to Kansas City, Kansas where he met my grandmother.
Speaker 1: And before--well, your grandfather didn't die until you were in high school.  Did you have a relationship, a one on one relationship with both, or either of them?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  I spent much time in both their homes, with both of them in their home; I spent a lot of time with them.  And he was, he was just, he was a big personality.  He was a very strong man, very much a man's man.  He took care of the house, he took care of my grandmother, and he insisted that the men in the family be very strong, that they knew how to fix cars and knew how to take care of their homes, and knew how to be responsible for themselves.  He prided himself on being able to take care of himself, and he wanted his sons to grow up that way.  And he spoiled my mother [Donna Mitchell Plummer], as the only woman, as the only girl in the family.  He spoiled her, and always wanted her to have the best.  And my grandmother was very organized, very precise.  She, I think I picked up a lot of those skills from her.  She was always on time, always meticulous in her dress; very, very, bright, an extraordinarily bright woman.  And, you know, she was just, you know, she cared a lot about the young people that she worked with in the social welfare agency, and was always trying to better their situations, just like her daughter, my mother.  It was not uncommon for her to bring someone home that didn't have a place to stay, or to get personally involved in the kids that she was placing.
Speaker 1: Was your grandfather in any of the wars?  Did he ever talk about his military experience?
Speaker 2: He, he, never really talked, you know.  He served in the service, but I don't know the scope of his military service.  He just never really talked about it at all, but I do know that he ended up in Kansas as a result of military service of some sort.
Speaker 1: Do you know your great-grandparents?
Speaker 2: Not on that side of the family (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 608464
Speaker 1: We're going to come back a little later and talk about your relationship with your mother [Donna Mitchell Plummer].  But tell me your father's name and when and where he was born.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My father was Louis Henry Plummer, Jr. [Louis Plummer, Jr.].  He was born also in Kansas City, Kansas in 1942.
Speaker 1: And did he share any stories about his growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He, his father was a lawyer, and they, you know, probably were considered middle class.  He grew up not far from my mother.  They went to the same grade school, the same middle school, the same high school.  And they knew each other pretty much all their lives.  They didn't start dating until late in high school and then in college.  They, my father had a, pretty much a childhood similar to my mom's.  Like I said, it was a very close knit community.  They didn't have many issues with race, and grew up pretty much around people who were, who had their own businesses, and went to school and were educated.  You know, from all indications, they had a pretty solid childhood, you know, pretty much fun and just carefree for the most part.
Speaker 1: And where did your father go to school?
Speaker 2: He went to school in Kansas City, Kansas.  He and my mother both went to Kansas University [sic. University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas] for college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Both of them went to--actually I know you're going to have me come back to this.  But I ended up going to the same high school that both my parents went to [Sumner High School; Sumner Academy of Arts and Science, Kansas City, Kansas], but it had turned into a magnet school by the time that I attended, as a result of busing.  So, I can come back to that later.  But yeah, it was the only black high school in the city at that point and time.
Speaker 1: Now, your father's parents.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me their names.
Speaker 2: My father's mother was Verona Plummer.  And my father's father was Louis Plummer, Sr.
Speaker 1: And tell me about them.
Speaker 2: Both of them are from the Kansas area, Kansas City, Kansas.  My mother was the daughter of a preacher, a very conservative preacher.  She was the granddaughter of a mixed race relationship, and I don't know a lot about that, but she looked very, very, fair skinned.
Speaker 1: Well, you said your mother.  You mean your grandmother?
Speaker 2: My grandmother, my grandmother on my father's side, yes.  And so she was very, very fair skinned.  And my grandmother actually worked for many years as an assistant in the research facility at the UMKC Hospital [University of Missouri-Kansas City Hospital Hill Campus, Kansas City, Missouri].  And I found out later that at the time she died, many of the people she worked with didn't know that she was African American, because she was very, very fair-skinned and had very fine hair.  But she was the daughter of a preacher in a very quiet family.  And my grandfather was the daughter [sic. son] of a former military, a chaplain in the [U.S.] military, who started a church in Kansas City, and that's how the family got to the Kansas area.  He was educated, he was a lawyer, and sat for the bar.  He went to Kansas University college and then sat for the bar and then worked--he could not make a living, or didn't feel like he could make a living as a lawyer back in those days representing African Americans.  But he decided to go to work for the postal service [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service], and then worked for the postal service for many years as a contract compliance officer ultimately.  And then he retired in his sixties and started his law practice again, or for the first time, in his sixties and then practiced law for about ten years before he retired a second time.
Story_ID: 608465
Speaker 1: You said you have more information about your father's [Louis Plummer, Jr.] side of the family.  So, do you know your great-grandparents or their names?
Speaker 2: I know of them through a book ['Out of the Depths or The Triumph of the Cross'] that was written about our family that dates back to 1921.  A great-great-great aunt--I believe it's great--some great aunt, Nellie Arnold Plummer, was an African American educator.  She wrote a book in 1920 about the Plummer family that dates back to the Civil War days and traces our family back to Cupid Plummer, who was in the Civil War [sic. Revolutionary War].  And as a result of her book, I kind of have a greater background of my family, although I did not know personally my great-grandfather on my father's side or any of his, my great relatives on that side.
Speaker 1: Are some stories you remember about--
Speaker 2: About the family?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Actually, it's quite remarkable.  And I didn't find out a lot about this until a few years ago.  We had a family reunion on the plantation where our family served as slaves.  It's designated as a national historic site in Riversdale, Maryland [sic. Riverdale Park, Maryland], and it is called the Riversdale plantation [Riversdale House Museum].  And on the plantation there is a slave cabin that was built more recently that has the history of our family on the wall of the slave cabin as a result of the book written by Nellie Arnold Plummer.  And it goes back to say that Cupid was a Civil War--he fought in the Civil War on behalf of his master, and as a result gained his freedom.  And he was free, and then he ultimately bought the freedom for his wife and his children.  But for some period of time, they were in slavery.  And so, part of the book is letters written by Cupid back and forth to his family, who was in slavery.  And so it goes on to tell the story of Cupid and his family.  And ultimately there were--several of the family members that remained there in Maryland were free.  One of my aunts, great-great aunts [Sarah Miranda Plummer], rather, crossed over to Virginia and was kidnapped and taken back into slavery and was shipped off to Louisiana.  The family hired a private detective back then and actually traced her, tracked her down.  And she ended up being with some Catholic nuns in Louisiana, and they arranged to buy her freedom.  They bought her freedom, and as a result of being in captivity and being a slave in Louisiana with these nuns, she became introduced to the, you know, to the Catholic religion.  She ultimately didn't become Catholic, but she did develop a relationship with God.  And as a result, after she gained her freedom she went back to Maryland and started a church.  The family started a church there, and the church is still in existence in Maryland.  And so we've been to the church and seen the headstone, I mean the cornerstone of the church with her name on it and everything.
Speaker 1: Do you know the name of the church?
Speaker 2: St. Paul's Church [St. Paul Baptist Church, Bladensburg, Maryland].  And I can't recall whether it was Methodist or Episcopalian or something.  But it was St. Paul's in Maryland.  I have the exact name upstairs.  But--
Speaker 1: That's fine.  So the nuns that she was with, were these black nuns?
Speaker 2: No, white nuns, white nuns, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And then my great-great-grandfather was a, was the first commissioned officer in the Army.  He was commissioned as a chaplain, and then he was sent out to Fort Leavenworth to fight with the, to serve with the Buffalo Soldiers out in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.  He was, he lost his commission though, as a result of a conviction, where he was convicted for fraternizing with the enlisted men.  Because there were no other black soldiers, he had to drink with the enlisted men, and as a result was convicted.   The family spent many years trying to have his conviction overturned, and ultimately was able to get a recognition by the Army that the conviction was invalid.  And a few years ago we had a formal military ceremony, and the chaplains of the U.S. Army recognized him as an officer of the U.S. Army, and recognized the family.
Speaker 1: Tell me his name.
Speaker 2: It was Louis--it was Henry Plummer [Henry Vinton Plummer].  Henry Plummer was his name.  After being convicted and leaving the Army in Leavenworth, Kansas, he started a church in Leavenworth, Kansas called Rosewood Church [sic.], and then ultimately moved to Kansas City, Kansas where my grandfather [Louis Plummer, Sr.] was born.  So that was my grandfather's father, Henry Plummer.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Any other stories?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Those are the biggest ones, yeah.
Speaker 1: Those are the good ones.
Speaker 2: Those were the main ones, yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, well, do you have any more, or anything else?
Speaker 2: Well, the only thing I know is that the land that's currently now the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] was the land that was part of the Riversdale plantation [Riversdale House Museum, Riverdale Park, Maryland] that my parents--my family served on.  And after they became free slaves, the family that owned the Riversdale plantation gave a large percentage of that land to my family.  And so, they owned that land for many years until it was eventually sold.  And now it's part of the University of Maryland.
Story_ID: 608466
Speaker 1: Your mother [Donna Mitchell Plummer] and father [Louis Plummer, Jr.], in their growing up, did they, did their families own the land that they lived on?  Or did they live in houses?
Speaker 2: They did live in houses.  And they did purchase those homes.  At some point they owned them.  I don't know how long, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a story about how your mother and father met?  Now, I know you said that they went to school together, so they knew each other.  But is there a story about how they started dating and got married?
Speaker 2: I think that they always knew each other.  Again, because Kansas--the black population of Kansas was pretty small; this was a pretty tight community.  So they've always known each other, and their families have always known each other.  And it was just a matter of when they became high school students [at Sumner High School; Sumner Academy of Arts and Science, Kansas City, Kansas], they just, you know, kind of went out on a play date just because they'd known each other forever.  And it turned into a more serious date, and they started dating very seriously.  They ended up going off to college and then getting married.  My mother dropped out of college, and she ultimately finished college later on, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, let's talk about you coming along.  How many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: I don't have any.
Speaker 1: Any?
Speaker 2: No.  My mother had twins that would have been about four years younger than me, but they passed away at childbirth.  So I didn't, you know, I didn't know them.  But other than that, I'm the only one.
Story_ID: 608467
Speaker 1: Well, let me take you back to your earliest childhood memory.  What would that be?
Speaker 2: I have a lot of memories being at each of my grandparents' homes.  My Grandfather Plummer [Louis Plummer, Sr.], who was the lawyer, I have a lot of memories of sitting--he had a little seating area where he watched television.  And he was a very vocal person, and we were always, as a family, involved in family debates.  He would debate over any issue.  And it was sort of commonplace that we would debate about a TV show or something that was going on in the city [Kansas City, Kansas].  And so I have a lot of memories of sitting on the steps overlooking the sitting area, where my parents [Donna Mitchell Plummer and Louis Plummer, Jr.] and my grandparents and aunts and uncles would sit around and debate all sorts of issues just for the sake of debating.  My grandfather didn't believe in agreeing to anything, so he would make everything into a debate.  So I have a lot of memories of that.  And then on my mother's side of the family, I have a lot of memories of spending time with my grandparents on her side of the family.  Largely, my grandfather [Lephus Mitchell, Sr.] would sit in a chair that I can still picture him on, in the kitchen.  And the house looks to this day very much the same that it did fifty or sixty years ago.  He's sitting in his same little chair just giving out words of wisdom as people came in the house; visitors and people who he was counseling, or just, you know, who he served as a mentor to.  Or even, you know, as my mother and I are heading in and out the door, he always had some sort of advice, "Take care of your mother.  Make sure she doesn't lose her keys.  Make sure you remember where you're parked."  He was just always constantly, you know, sort of the source of, you know, guidance and direction for anybody coming in and out of the house.  And then my grandmother [Marie Harrison Mitchell] was always taking care of the household and making sure that everything was neat and clean and orderly, and that everyone ate, you know; just was very much the homemaker for the family.
Story_ID: 608468
Speaker 1: Because your [paternal] grandfather [Louis Plummer, Sr.] was an attorney, was that something that you thought about early on in your life?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: When was the first time you thought about it?
Speaker 2: Wow, I'm sure probably in grade school.  But I knew in junior high for sure that I wanted to be an attorney, and had a very detailed plan of what I needed to do be an attorney, I mean to the point where I knew I didn't need to make any Bs.  I knew I needed to make all A's because I needed to get into a good college and in order to get into a good law school.  So, I transferred out of art class in junior high and eighth grade because I was going to be make a B; I had no artistic skill whatsoever.  (Laughter) I didn't want to make a B, so I transferred out of art class in eighth grade [at West Junior School, Kansas City, Kansas].  And my only other threatened B was a typing course, which I remember distinctly my mother [Donna Mitchell Plummer] and father [Louis Plummer, Jr.] helping me type extra credit lines to get extra credit points for typing class so I wouldn't make a B in typing class.  But I very much wanted to be a lawyer, and he told me exactly what I needed to do to be a lawyer, so I followed that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Although I didn't know what a lawyer was, other than having seen him.  But I didn't have the big scope of what a lawyer was, just a very narrow view of what a lawyer was.  But I liked arguing, so that was good enough.  (Laughter) And he said I was good at it.
Story_ID: 608469
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your early childhood days, from when you can remember up to going into junior high school, up to the end of elementary school.  Tell me first, let's talk about the community in which you and your family lived.  Tell me about the community.  If you were to walk a square block, if you could, tell me who lived in the community, who your friends were, and the people who owned the businesses.
Speaker 2: Sure.  When I first--my early years, I'd say up until probably I started grade school, I lived in what's now considered a project, but was an inner city apartment community within Kansas City, Kansas.  It was predominantly black, but it was like, it was new housing at that point and time.  All of my parents' friends lived in the same area, and so I remember having--the kids of my parents' friends, we were all about the same age.  And we all are still very much friends today.  We grew up in this little area called, you know, Gatewood [ph.] is what it was called.  It was a little housing area, and we all, all of our parents started out there.  And they would have card parties, and the kids would be out in the back playing and swinging on the swing and playing in the pool.  And we all kind of grew up together in that little community.  About the time we all started getting ready to go to school, the parents decided to try to move into a better community so the kids could go to better schools.  So we all moved a little farther out to what at that time would be considered the suburbs of Kansas City, Kansas.  And at that time, we moved into what were predominantly white communities.  And so from the time that I was in grade school until probably junior high, we lived in a predominantly white community.  We were the only black family in the community for some period of time.  As time passed, other black communi-- families moved in.  And it was, you know, a neighborhood block, middle class homes.
Story_ID: 608470
Speaker 1: My parents [Donna Mitchell Plummer and Louis Plummer, Jr.] elected, instead of sending me to the public school, to send me to a private Catholic school across town in Kansas City, Missouri.  So, I didn't go to school with the kids in my neighborhood.  But I did--my best friend at that time was a little white girl up the street who, we were the only two young kids on the block.  And so we had a good friendship, but we didn't go to the same school together.  So I went to a private school in another part of town.  When I, my parents eventually moved out further into the suburbs as the city grew.  And as a high school student, my parents moved out to where the best white high school was.  At that point in time, Kansas City, Kansas went through a busing desegregation plan, and they created a magnet school [Sumner Academy of Arts and Science] back in Kansas City, Kansas in the inner city at the same high school my parents went to [Sumner High School], that they were trying to get me away from.  So I ended up getting bused back into the inner city and went to high school--I was the first attendee at this new magnet school, which in fact was the same school that my parents went to.  But they changed the name, they changed the school colors, they changed the education plan in the school, and made it a magnet school.  And they took the top 10 percent of the B plus students from all the other high schools and bused them back into the inner city to integrate this one high school that had predominantly been all black.  So, but my--
Speaker 2: So the name of the elementary school that you went to was--
Speaker 1: Was Loretto Academy [Kansas City, Missouri].
Speaker 2: Spell that for me.
Speaker 1: L-O-R-E-T-T-O, Loretto Academy.  It was a unique open concept Catholic school.  The nuns did not wear habits; they were plainclothes nuns.  I didn't follow the Catholic religion.  It was a very unconventional school.  We didn't have grades.  We were in an open concept arrangement, where we'd self-learn.  You'd learn at your own pace, and you got an evaluation at the end of the grading period.  You took the test on your own and you did self-testing, and then the teacher would grade the test.  We didn't have desks.  My early desk was an apple cart or a banker's box, which we decorated.  We had all our school supplies in the banker's box.  And the classroom was this large open room with lots of different little seating areas; bean bags, pillows, lofts, just kind of a weird--picnic tables, just kind of different learning environments.  So I didn't go to a traditional classroom until I was almost in the sixth grade.  I was in the sixth grade.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you went to this school.  Did you go to kindergarten?
Speaker 1: I did go to kindergarten at the school that my mother taught at for one year.  And then I went to this private school for first through fourth grade.  And then when I came out of private school, I skipped a grade and went into sixth grade in elementary school, in public elementary school.  They stopped the bus at the private school, so I couldn't go any longer, yeah.
Speaker 2: What was the name of the school where you went to kindergarten, where your mother worked?
Speaker 1: Hawthorn Elementary [Hawthorn Elementary School, Kansas City, Missouri].
Speaker 2: And so in the sixth grade, what's the name of the school you go to?
Speaker 1: John F. Kennedy Elementary School [Kansas City, Kansas].
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, tell me about the transition from this private school to public school.
Speaker 1: It was a little tough at first, because I had, you know, in the private school we didn't have to raise our hands to go to the bathroom.  You know, we didn't have grades, or, you know, we worked at our own pace.  We, you know, we had many courses on Fridays where we'd go on field trips and, you know, learn about how they built a highway; we'd go to a highway site.  Or, how you--where your food comes from; we'd go to a farm.  So, sitting--going to a public school where you're in a classroom all day long was a little bit of an adjustment.  And I was, I really did, I advanced farther in the private school, so I was pretty bored my sixth grade year in the public grade, because we had done so much more in the private school environment.  So, but, it was hard making friends, because I hadn't been to school with any of these people for a while.  But eventually I adjusted, but it was a little bit of a transition.
Story_ID: 608471
Speaker 1: Before we go on to--did you go to a middle school or did you just--?
Speaker 2: I did, I went to a middle school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But before we go on to middle school, we talked a little bit about the community in which you lived and your family life.  You went to a Catholic school [Loretto Academy, Kansas City, Missouri], but was your family religious?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Not Catholic, but Baptist.  We grew up in the Baptist church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, both my parents grew up in the church.  My mom [Donna Mitchell Plummer] was very active in her church.  My dad [Louis Plummer, Jr.] was, he grew up in the church but he wasn't as strongly active when I was growing up.  My mother was extremely active in the church.  So yeah, that's been a part of our family's history for as far back as I can remember.
Speaker 1: What is your experience with the Baptist church?  I mean did you--
Speaker 2: Personally?
Speaker 1: --go to Sunday school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No, I was there, I was there every day. Any day that they had church, my mom was there and I was right there with her.  I'm sure I resented church for a long time until I matured and gained a better understanding and a personal relationship.  But yes, I got dragged to church (laughter) as often as the doors were open.  My mother was one that was there all the time.  I guess around teenage--it became more personal for me when I became a teenager.  But growing up I was at church every Sunday, every Saturday, every Wednesday night, we were there.

Speaker 1: What other extracurricular activities were you involved in in your elementary school days?
Speaker 2: Dancing.  My mother [Donna Mitchell Plummer] took me to dance school, and so I did dancing for many years.  And then, yeah, that's pretty much it in elementary.
Speaker 1: What type of dance?
Speaker 2: Ballet, tap, you know.  I'm sure I tried piano for a little while and didn't do too well with that.  I played the viola and didn't do very well in that. (Laughter) I was not artistic, but I did enjoy dancing.  I also began--I had an appreciation at the Catholic school [Loretto Academy, Kansas City, Missouri], the private school, for other types of dance.  We had an Irish nun who taught me Irish dance.  And we learned Irish dance and we would go around to the nursing homes and dance the Irish jig.  And in high school [Sumner Academy of Arts and Science, Kansas City, Kansas], I've always had this sort of interest in ethnic dancing since then, and have done Mexican dance and African dance and other forms of dance, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you belong to any of the organizations like the Girl Scouts [Girl Scouts of the United States of America] or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Jack and Jill.  My mom did Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.] when I was in grade school and high school.  And I think that's probably it.
Speaker 1: Were there any experiences that you remember?
Speaker 2: With?
Speaker 1: Jack and Jill.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I mean, I had a good time with Jack and Jill.  Most of my friends through grade school--because I went to a private school away from the community in which I lived in, most of my friends in the community weren't people I went to school with.  They were either people from Jack or Jill--I didn't have a lot of close friends with the people that I went to school with other than the other kids from my area that were bussed over there, because we lived so far away.  So, Jack and Jill was pretty much the only other group of black friends that I had.  And so there were lots of opportunities, you know, exposures through Jack and Jill.  You know, dances, you know, concerts, the opera, different sorts of programs that they took us to on a monthly basis.  So, I have a lot of good memories of that.  I stayed in Jack and Jill through high school and was active in the teen program, and was an officer in their teen convention, and all that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: And what did you take away from that experience?
Speaker 2: Jack and Jill?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: I think it really was a sense of--well, the biggest part of Jack and Jill that stuck with me was the sense of giving back to the community.  Our chapter was really big on service projects, and the teens were very involved in service projects.  And even as a young youth in the youth programs, I remember being involved in service projects.  So, that, that seemed to be a big part of it for me in the chapter that we were with, and that stuck with me for a long time.
Story_ID: 608473
Speaker 1: You grew up in a community that was predominantly white.  Is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes, in terms of where I lived, although my interactions were predominantly in the black community.  But yeah, the school I attended and the--at least early on was a white school, and the neighborhood was white, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you have any interaction with some of the white kids in the neighborhood to learn about any of their culture besides--you know, you talked about the Irish dance.  But were there other white people who you might have interacted with and--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --learned about their culture?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think there was one little girl.  Her name was Lori Ann Racky [ph.].  She lived up the street, and she and I were pretty much best friends.  She was my only friend in the neighborhood all through grade school.  And I remember that having a relationship with her was probably the first time I really ever--well, the second time probably, that I recognized the issue of race, because it just wasn't an issue up until that point.  And it wasn't an issue with her, other than she tended to go to different places than I did.  So when I went with Lori Ann and her parents to activities, if we went to the pool, it was a pool that I wasn't familiar with.  It was a pool on the other side of town that there was no other black people at this pool.  Or if we went to church, to her, you know, Vacation Bible School, it was to a church that was all white.  And so it was the first time that I had this recognition of: oh, wow, she does different things than I do because all of her stuff is with white people, and all of my stuff is with black people.  And then the only other point growing up, where I had the sense of differences in the race, was when I was at the private school [Loretto Academy, Kansas City, Missouri].  It was sort of the first time I was around people that had a lot of money.  I mean we had a middle class family, but some of the kids that attended the private school that I attended, they had, you know, from my perspective at that age, they had big, big, houses.  And there was a big difference between the way they lived and the way I lived.  And I hadn't noticed that before, because everybody in my circle kind of all lived the same way.  But, and they all tended to be white, and we were all black.  But other than that, I did get a sense just that her church was different in the way that they conducted worship service.  But it wasn't necessarily bad or good, it was just different.
Speaker 1: What religion was she?
Speaker 2: I don't even remember.  I just remember it was a little small white church.  And, you know, it was very quiet as opposed to my church, and you know, they just were a little bit more formal than we were.  And I just remember those sorts of differences in culture that came with just a different way of doing things.
Story_ID: 608474
Speaker 1: Now, was there a teacher or a nun that might have, that you remember that stands out in your memory that might have been encouraging, or someone that you looked up to?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  At the Catholic school [Loretto Academy, Kansas City, Missouri], I think Sister Mary [ph.] and Sister Susan [ph.] were very much--you know, I still remember them to this day, they were very encouraging.  They were just fun.  I just remember loving to learn, and appreciating the learning process through them.  They made our lessons, you know, fun and exciting and energetic, and we just learned a lot from them.  And being exposed--I remember we had music class.  They had a waterbed in the music room.  And so we would lay on the waterbed and listen to Mozart [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart] and, you know, all the great musicians and the great composers of the day.  It's funny that, you know, you can listen to them, but you remember it and have a greater appreciation for it when you're listening to it with a headphone laying on a waterbed, you know.  You can feel the movement of the music through the waves in the waterbed.  And so they just had a different way of teaching, you know, that made teaching fun.  And we learned about history through Irish dance.  And, you know, from Sister Susan we learned about--gosh, she was math, and we just had a different way of learning math, and made it interesting.  So, yeah, they had a big impact on just helping me appreciate the learning process.
Speaker 1: At this age, and this is up until you were twelve.  What did you think you would become when you finished school?
Speaker 2: At that time, I thought about an oceanographer.  I think I wanted to be--I think it was--they had a 'Flipper' TV show.  I really liked Flipper, and I wanted to be an oceanographer, because I wanted to go swim with the dolphins.  (Laughter) So, at that stage I definitely wanted to be an oceanographer.
Speaker 1: What were you reading at that time?
Speaker 2: Oh, up until twelve, let's see.  Nothing stands out at that point.  I think probably the first book that stands out was something I read in middle school.  But at that point I know I read a lot, but I don't--nothing really stuck with me.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 608475
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the sixth grade, you made this transition to public school, and you're ready to go on to Kennedy [John F. Kennedy Elementary School, Kansas City, Kansas]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, what was that transition like, going into middle school?
Speaker 2: Well, actually sixth grade was Kennedy, and then middle school was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --seventh grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a little different in the Kansas City public school system.  Middle school was seventh, eighth, and ninth grades.  And I attended West Junior High [West Junior High School, Kansas City, Kansas], that's was what it was called at that point.  And I'm not sure why I ended up at West, because it wasn't the school that I was zoned to be in.  But because my mother [Donna Mitchell Plummer] worked for the school district, I think it had something to do with the fact that it was closer to the school that she worked at.  And so from a transportation standpoint, it was easier for her to get me to and from school if I was near her.  So, I ended up at West Junior High.  It was a very interracial school.  It was about 50 percent African American and 50 percent--interracial for Kansas was black and white.  There wasn't anything else at that point.  So, it was 50 percent white and 50 percent African American.  And we all got along great.  It was, you know, it was just kind of an idyllic junior high period, you know.  I was involved in the drill team, and debates, and speech, and student council, and all the school activities, and was very active in school.  I spent a lot of time there before and after school working on projects.  I had a lot of friends at the school.  And it was just a very positive high school and junior high school experience.
Story_ID: 608476
Speaker 1: Did you run for student government?
Speaker 2: I'm sure I did, yeah.  (Laughter) I can't, I can't--yeah, you got elected, but I don't know if it was actually running or you raised your hand and said, "I'll do it."  But I was really into that kind of stuff.  So, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you said the debate team?
Speaker 2: At that point, it was speech.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And then in high school [Sumner Academy of Arts and Science, Kansas City, Kansas], it was debate.  But we did speech, and I was on the speech team, yeah.  I tried out for volleyball and I didn't make it.  I wasn't athletic at all.  (Laughter) Actually, I was sick during junior high, so that's probably part of the junior high period [at West Junior High School, Kansas City, Kansas].  I was diagnosed with a thyroid disorder and so I had to have my thyroid gland removed, so I was out part of the year.  And so, my junior high year was a period of trying to figure out what was going on, and then how to treat it.  So, there were one or two years there where I have more memories of going back and forth to the hospital trying to figure out what was going on than actually at school.  But other than that, school was pretty positive.
Story_ID: 608477
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers there that you remember that stand out that?
Speaker 2: Probably Miss Crowe [ph.] was my speech teacher.  And she was, I really enjoyed speech.  It really helped me with public speaking and being comfortable speaking in front of a crowd, and learning how to put together a speech.  And she tried to get us a little bit ahead in preparation for high school, so she was teaching us how to do a research paper.  And I can remember all this stuff, how to do note cards.  She just gave us a lot of good practical advice beyond just teaching us speech, but how to be successful in school and how to be successful in high school, and things of that nature.  Miss Marietta [ph.] was my typing teacher.  And she was just a really nice person, and followed me to high school [Sumner Academy of Arts and Science, Kansas City, Kansas]; she was in high school with us.  So, yeah, there were a lot of very positive teachers.
Speaker 1: Were your teachers all white up until junior high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And in junior high school at West [West Junior High School, Kansas City, Kansas], were there--?
Speaker 2: There were more African American teachers at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Miss Crowe was an African American teacher, and Miss Marietta was white.  And another teacher was Mr. Carr [ph.] who was my math teacher, and he was very influential.
Speaker 1: Who was the principal at Kennedy [John F. Kennedy Elementary School, Kansas City, Kansas] and at West?
Speaker 2: Oh, I can't remember at Kennedy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I can't remember at West.
Speaker 1: At West?
Speaker 2: I don't recall having much interaction with the principal.
Story_ID: 608478
Speaker 1: So you get ready to go to high school.  And tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Well, at that point in time, as I mentioned before, Kansas was going through a desegregation plan.  They were under a desegregation order.  And at that time there was only, there was one predominantly, well, solely black high school.  And then there were only four other, three other--four other high schools in the city.  And so in order to integrate, they decided to make the predominantly black school a magnet school and take the top kids from all the other schools and bus them into the inner city to this predominantly black school and try to integrate it, reverse integration, that way, instead of bussing the black kids out.  And then if you weren't in the top of your class, you got bussed out to one of the other high schools.  And so, you had to maintain a B average to stay in the Sumner magnet school.  It was called the Sumner Academy of Arts and Science [Kansas City, Kansas].  So it was designed to be a college preparatory school, and it was starting, it was going to start in the ninth grade.  And although I went there in the tenth grade, I was in the first class to enter into the school at that stage.  So, we voted on the school colors.  We established all the school traditions.  That was for the first cheerleaders for the school, you know, the first everything for the school.  And we really kind of created the foundation for this new school.  And again, my parents [Donna Mitchell Plummer and Louis Plummer, Jr.] had gone to the same building, but it was Sumner High School back then, and I went back to the same building as Sumner Academy of Arts and Science.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now since the building was there and it was an all-black school--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --and now they're bringing in white kids.  Do you know if there was a change in what went on in the school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, substantially.  It was interesting because--kind of in both ways.  From one perspective, there was a lot of history in Sumner High School, the black school.  I mean, like I said, my grandfather went there and my parents went there.  All of the blacks in the community went to that high school.  A lot of very successful people who have gone on to do great things went to that high school.  They had a very, a very good sports program.  So Sumner High School had won state championships, and regional, and district championships in sports for many, many years.  So, there were just trophy cases just full of trophies from over the years.  A lot of the players there had gone on to Kansas University [sic. University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas] and other universities to do well in college, and some eventually made it to the pros, as I understand.  There's a lot of history in that school, a lot of strong relationships and bonds.  And even to this day, they continue to have Sumner High School class reunions.  The group was just very, very tight knit.  They all grew up in the same community and went to the same high school.  So there was a, there was a lot of, I guess disappointment that a lot of those traditions and history was kind of pushed aside in an effort to desegregate and create these new traditions.  So there was a little bit of a, I guess not tension, but I guess there was a little bit of tension.  It wasn't negative in any sense, but you could just tell there was this tension between the past and the future, that existed as a result of the change.  In terms of the education level, it's funny.  My mom just told me to this day, and we didn't realize this, but Sumner High School probably had some of the best teachers in the country, largely because--as a result of a grant or either some sort of litigation, there was a decision made many, many years back, I think this was like maybe the '50s [1950s], that paid the teachers at Sumner High School the same as white teachers in the rest of the school district.  And as a result of that, they were getting some of the best teachers from all across the country who were coming to Kansas to work at Sumner High School.  So I think they had a very good program there, and they, you know, graduated a number of people who did very well and went on to college.  When I say there was a change, the change was they just changed the whole format of the school.  It became intentionally a college preparatory school.  They determined all the kids would take a foreign language for so many years.  We had to study Latin in the first two years of school.  We did internships our senior year in school.  So it became, it was a very planned college preparatory program as opposed to the more traditional educational program that existed in the past, although the quality of education I would say was probably very good at the old Sumner High School.  Again, during the time my parents were there, the time just prior to when I arrived, I'm not sure what the quality of the education was.  But, you know, this college prep curriculum that they established has been very, very successful for the school, and has gotten a great deal of recognition over the years.
Speaker 1: Well, they had really good teachers.  As you said, they paid them like they paid the white teachers?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: This is before you came there?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  That was like--
Speaker 1: Did your parents, did your mother or father ever talk about having secondhand books?  Because that was a lot that was going on during that time--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --where they would get the books from the white schools.
Speaker 2: From the white schools?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, I've never heard them talk about that.  I can't say that that was an issue one way or the other.  But I never heard them talk about that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 608479
Speaker 1: Let's talk more about your days there and some of the classes, the teachers, and what you enjoyed most about this new school [Sumner Academy of Arts and Science, Kansas City, Kansas].
Speaker 2: I had a great time in high school.  I mean it was really a challenging environment, because it was a new school.  We were, you had the benefit of making a lot of, you know, establishing a lot of precedent for, you know, the school, establishing a lot of traditions.  So, everything was new.  A couple of things that stand out for me was the debate program; we had a very strong debate program.  I was very much engaged in debate, and pretty much spent my whole four years there on the debate team, traveling throughout the State of Kansas debating.  I was a cheerleader.  I was the first cheerleader for the new school, and was a cheerleader my entire time.  So, I was involved from that aspect.  I was on the newspaper staff.  I traveled to Mexico for the Spanish class to do an internship in Mexico.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: That was probably my senior year in high school.  I, my senior--that was my junior year in high school.  Because my senior year in high school, I knew that I wanted to go into law.  And so I did an independent study course, and spent half of my time at the state DA's office, at the state DA, district attorney's office.  And I actually went to like two classes a day, and then up to the courthouse and spent the rest of the day at the courthouse as an intern in the DA's office my senior year.  I think the other thing that was really profound, was our senior class had a class called humanities.  It was a sort of class that, they were trying to get us used to how you have classes in college.  And so all of the seniors had the class together in the auditorium, and it was extremely interesting because there were four teachers that taught the class.  And we just kind of, it was an historical class.  And we started off and we would look at a period of time in history.  We would look at what was going on from a historical standpoint, what was going on from a religious standpoint, what was going on at that period of time from a cultural standpoint, and then what was going on from a political standpoint.  And then we just went through, you know, time up until the present day.  And each period of time, we would look at it from those four different perspectives.  And that was sort of an aha moment for me, because it really kind of put everything I was learning into some sort of coherent process so that you could see, you know, what was happening when Michelangelo, you know, was painting, and you know, carved 'David,' and what was going on in the political scene, and what was going on in the religious--you kind of saw it all fit together at one point and time.  And so, that was my first understanding of how you would study in college, and how they would teach courses in college.  And I think for me that was a pretty profound class.  I didn't know of any other high schoolers that had a senior class like that.
Story_ID: 608480
Speaker 1: And your internship, talk more about what you saw, and the cases.  Were you in the courtroom?
Speaker 2: Absolutely in the courtroom.  The Kansas City, Kansas courtroom was very small.  (Laughter) There wasn't a whole lot going on.  We had a really high profile murder trial during the year that I was there.  And it was a high profile case, because they didn't have a body.  And so it was a big thing that the district attorney was going to prosecute a case without a body.  And they had evidence that the gentleman had been murdered, but they could never find the body.  And so I remember it, because we sat, you know, right front and center throughout the whole trial of this case.  And at one point in time, a threat was made to the district attorney by the defendant in the case, and he had to have around the clock protection.  So there was a big, you know, debate as to whether or not we needed around the clock protection (laughter), because we had been in the trial kind of supporting the district attorney the whole time.  And we didn't ultimately do it, but it was fascinating watching this trial.  So I had a real up close view of the criminal legal process, being right in the courthouse when this, you know, pretty high profile case was going on.  And Kansas City, Kansas didn't get a lot of activity back then.  But it was fun, we actually worked in the DA's office.  And we did filing and, you know, did some research, and then spent time in trial whenever we could, whenever there was something going on.
Story_ID: 608481
Speaker 1: Well, tell me what you were doing for fun.  What music were you listening to?  What was going on in the world during that time?
Speaker 2: You know, it's funny.  My world was high school, it really was.  Everything I did was revolved around high school.  I didn't watch much television at that point and time, I just didn't have time.  I mean literally I was gone from early in the morning, and took the late bus back home.  You know, so I was getting home at nine or ten o'clock at night.  I don't recall ever going straight home after school.  There was always something going on, whether it was cheerleading practice, debate practice, newspaper, or something.  So, my life was the high school [Sumner Academy of Arts and Science, Kansas City, Kansas].  And, you know, we were constantly going to away games, going to away track meets.  It was a little different from the way my girls [Kristin McClure and Morgan McClure] do now.  I cheered for all seasons and all sports.  So like I said, everything was there.  I really wasn't into music.  I vaguely, you know, heard about stuff going on, but I didn't, I couldn't tell you who was even popular around that time.  It just wasn't on my radar screen.  It was all school.
Story_ID: 608482
Speaker 1: You made this decision that you would go--you wanted to become an attorney?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And in high school, first, do you remember who the president was for this new school [Sumner Academy of Arts and Science, Kansas City, Kansas]?
Speaker 2: The principal?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Did the same principal stay there, or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --did somebody new--?
Speaker 2: They changed the entire staff of the school.  And I can't, his name just slips me right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'll come back to you if I can find it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember, like, my counselor.  His name was Mr. Archer [ph.], and he's who I had the most interaction with.
Speaker 1: Did you talk to him about what college you would go to?  How were you steered in the direction of what school you would go to?
Speaker 2: I did it on my own.  I mean my parents [Donna Mitchell Plummer and Louis Plummer, Jr.] went to KU [University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas] and my grandfather [Louis Plummer, Sr.] went to KU.  He said to me, "It's a perfectly good school thirty miles up the road.  I don't know why you'd look anyplace else."  But I knew I wanted to get out of Kansas.  I don't know why, I just felt like it was small.  And I had a good time in high school, but I was ready to go.  And I really wanted to go.  So, it's funny how I'm going through the process of looking at colleges now with my daughter [Kristin McClure], and there's so much information available.  Back then I heard about schools, and I remember wanting to go to Williams College [Williamstown, Massachusetts].  But then my parents found out that there was a cross burned on the campus sometime during the year, so they said I couldn't go that far.  I applied to Washington University in St. Louis [St. Louis, Missouri].  I don't even know how I came across the school other than I started after my--I'm assuming after my PSAT [Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test] scores--I started receiving information in the mail from the schools, because it was just based on information that I received in the mail that I decided to look at schools.  I looked at schools in Texas, and Kansas University, and St. Louis.  And ultimately, I decided I wanted to go to Washington University.  Now my parents hadn't saved for college, and just assumed that I was going to be going to KU, so they didn't know how they were going to pay for Washington University.  So, right up until the very moment, I was teetering back and forth between Kansas University and Washington University, but I really wanted to go to Washington University.  So they ultimately figured out a way to, I was able to get some scholarship money from Wash U, and then they covered the rest.  And so, I ended up at Washington University in St. Louis.
Story_ID: 608483
Speaker 1: The summer before you left, did you have a job at any time before you went to college [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Right, yes.  Starting in my junior year of high school [Sumner Academy of Arts and Science, Kansas City, Kansas], in between the summer of my junior year and my senior year, my father [Louis Plummer, Jr.] worked for Hallmark Cards [Hallmark Cards, Inc.] at that point in time.  He had, my father previously, and my mother [Donna Mitchell Plummer], were both schoolteachers.  At some point in time, my father left the school system and went to work as a personnel manager, a HR [human resources] person, for Hallmark Cards.  And so my junior year--Hallmark was known for hiring relatives.  And so my junior year in high school, the summer between my junior and senior year, I got a job working at Hallmark Cards.  And then I became aware of a program called the INROADS program during my senior year.  And it was an internship program for minority students that placed you in corporations for the four years while you were in college, and focused on students that were interested in business and engineering fields.  And so after, during my senior year, I applied for, to be a part of the INROADS program and was accepted into the INROADS program.  And so for every summer after my senior year of summer--senior year of high school--up until I started law school [Emory University School of Law, Atlanta, Georgia], I worked at Hallmark Cards as part of the intern INROADS program.  So, my only work experience other than, you know, after I graduated from law school was at Hallmark Cards working at their corporate headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri.
Story_ID: 608484
Speaker 1: So tell me about, before we go on into college [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri], about family, things that you did with your family.  Did your family go on family vacations?
Speaker 2: Yes, a little bit, we did.  My grandfather owned a--my grandfather on my mother's side, Lephus Mitchell [Lephus Mitchell, Sr.], owned a camper.  And so when he retired, he, that was his dream, to travel across the country in this camper.  So, I remember going on trips with he and my grandmother [Marie Harrison Mitchell] and my mother [Donna Mitchell Plummer] and father [Louis Plummer, Jr.].  We'd drive across the country in the camper.  We went to Denver, to Colorado, went to the Painted Desert, the Grand Canyon [Arizona].  I remember him diving off a diving boarding in Las Vegas [Nevada].  We went to L.A., to relatives in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  So we spent trips going with him to the Ozarks [Ozark Mountains] and different places to visit relatives, in the camper.  I don't recall taking any--I didn't fly.  I don't think I got on a plane until I was in college or high school [Sumner Academy of Arts and Science, Kansas City, Kansas].  I take that back.  I did make one trip, but not as a family vacation; it was with school.  And, but we did a lot of family activities, mostly, like I said, with the family, the extended family; aunts, uncles, cousins, that sort of thing.

Speaker 1: Were there any family traditions that you remember with your family?
Speaker 2: Holidays were always a big deal with my family.  The one, I guess, tradition that I remember most was Christmas.  We would always spend Christmas Eve at my house, or because I was the youngest at that point in time on the Plummer side of the family, we'd spend Christmas Eve with the Plummer side of the family at my house, or whomever had the youngest kids.  So, that was kind of the tradition.  When my aunts and uncles started having kids they were about ten younger than me, and we would move it to their house.  But whoever had the youngest kids, we would spend Christmas Eve at their house.  And we always had a big Christmas Eve party, and there would always be gifts and lots of food and we'd exchange gifts and presents.  And then on Christmas day, I would always go to church with my mom [Donna Mitchell Plummer] and dad [Louis Plummer, Jr.].  And then we would go over to my mother's side of the family for Christmas breakfast and then we'd exchange gifts with that side of the family on Christmas day.  So, as far back as I can remember.  And then Easter we would always spend at one family's house.  Thanksgiving we would always spend at one family's house.  So, most of the traditions dealt around holidays, and there always was some sort of celebration at one of the grandparents' home.

Speaker 1: So, now what year do you graduate from high school [Sumner Academy of Arts and Science, Kansas City, Kansas]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-one [1981].
Speaker 1: So, now tell me, how do you prepare to go to college [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Wow.  I don't know how I prepared to go to college, other than I was just so ready to go.  (Laughter) Really I worked the summer, and INROADS was actually a phenomenal program for helping prepare me for college and for thinking about what I wanted to do with my life after college.  The program had workshops that we attended during the school year that prepared us for the jobs we would have in the summer.  And some of those workshops involved time management skills, office politics, dressing professionally, writing skills, just different workshops that really helped me in college as much as they helped me in the jobs that I had, and the internships.  The whole idea was that you would intern with a company for four years, and that company would get to know you, and you would get to know the company.  And then at the end of those four years, the goal was that the company would make you a permanent job offer.  But you'd have an inroad, having worked there for four summers while you were in college.  So, although I knew that I was going to law school, they still accepted me into the program.  And I told them I wanted to go to law school, but they still accepted me into the program saying, "Well, you just never know.  You might decide to go to work for the company."  So, that was a big help in terms of preparing for college.  But I don't know that I knew how to prepare for college.  I just assumed that I would continue doing the things that had allowed me to be successful in undergrad, I mean, in high school.  And I just, you know, knew that I had to make A's because I needed to get into law school.  (Laughter) So that's what I, that's how I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And so you kept--
Speaker 2: I just, I did.
Speaker 1: --true to that.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 608487
Speaker 1: Before we talk about graduation [from Sumner Academy of Arts and Science, Kansas City, Kansas], did you go to the prom?
Speaker 2: Did I go--
Speaker 1: To the prom?
Speaker 2: --to the prom?
Speaker 1: Was there a prom?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, di- went to the prom.  I made my dress.  I liked to sew.  I developed a--
Speaker 1: So that's creative.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I really--it is, but it's very mechanical, too.  I still love to sew.  It's the one thing I can do that takes my mind off of everything else, because I have to focus on what I'm doing.  But I started sewing in junior high school, and I sewed all through high school.  And so I made my own prom dress, and I used to make some of my clothes as well.  And I would have done more of it, I just didn't have the time.  But I really enjoyed doing that.  But I did, I had a--my boyfriend in my senior year was my only boyfriend my entire high school time.  And he, and he and I dated my entire senior year and went to the homecoming and the prom together.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Greg Walker [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And so graduation day, do you remember graduation day?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do.
Speaker 1: Tell me about graduation day.
Speaker 2: I remember it was hot, and everybody was crying.  And I couldn't understand why they were crying, because I was so glad to get out of there.  (Laughter) I was so ready to go.  They were like, "Aren't you upset?  Aren't you sad?"  I'm like, "No, I love you guys, but I'm ready to go."  But it was fun.  The only thing that happened that was a little negative was there was a couple in our class that had sort of a volatile relationship, and they got into a little spat at the graduation party.  And so they ended up shutting down the party early, and we didn't have any place to go.  So we went to the only twenty-four hour restaurant in town, and the cook was not prepared for the group that descended upon him.  So he locked the door and called the police, and we didn't eat either.  (Laughter) So, we didn't have much of a celebration after high school.  (Laughter) But other than that, it was a real, it was a good graduation.
Story_ID: 608488
Speaker 1: So, now let's talk about college.  Tell me about your first week.  Tell me about registering.
Speaker 2: The thing that stands out is my parents [Donna Mitchell Plummer and Louis Plummer, Jr.] took me to college and dropped me off.  And I had a roommate who I had not met; we had spoken on the phone.  She was from Rydal, Pennsylvania, and we had talked on the phone, and we'd agreed you bring this and I'll bring that.  I'll bring the TV and you bring the stereo.  It seemed like we got along fine.  When we walked into the room, her mother was standing there with a wine glass.  And she was unpacking, and she nearly dropped the glass when she looked up to see us, so I don't think she knew that I was African American.  But they were nevertheless very friendly.  And I soon realized that we came from totally different worlds.  Michelle had spent her--her name was Michelle Lipkin [ph.].  Michelle had spent the vast majority of her time at camps in the summer and shopping in New York, you know, prior to coming to school.  And she was very much East Coast; you know, money.  And she was very nice.  But we just concluded about, you know, halfway on, that we just had, you know, certain--different interest areas.  And, you know, she was just involved in some things that I wasn't involved in.  So she, probably after about a month, moved into a room down the hall.  But she left all the stuff that we had talked about bringing, so she left all her stereo and everything and most of her clothes in the room, and then she just moved down the hall.  And we continued to be friends, but she moved in with another Jewish girl who, they tended to have--they were from the East Coast and tended to have a little bit more in common.  And I had, didn't have a roommate for the first, you know, semester of school.  And the second semester, an African American young girl moved in with me.  But funny enough, we never really became that close, because I had already developed other friends by then.  And, but we ended up rooming together that year.  But I met my, one of my very good friends my freshman year.  Her name was Fran Merriweather [Frances Merriweather], and pretty much all through college we were inseparable, very close.  She was very much my opposite.  She was a free spirit, fun loving, East Coast--you know, she was from Providence, Rhode Island and just loved the world, saw no wrong with anybody.  She was very, didn't know what she wanted to do at college.  She was just my complete opposite, whereas I was very structured, detail oriented, focused, driven, and knew exactly what I wanted to be.  But for whatever reason we just clicked, and were good friends throughout college.
Speaker 1: Because you were very well prepared in high school [Sumner Academy of Arts and Science, Kansas City, Kansas], did you have any challenges with any of the courses?
Speaker 2: I majored in economics, and it was probably my most challenging class.  (Laughter) I don't know why I majored in economics.  Statistics was a challenge.  I never liked math classes.  Actually, I knew I just didn't have a math mind.  And so I actually took calculus in summer school, because I knew I didn't want to mess up my GPA [grade point average], and only the credits transferred.  So, I planned that out.  But other than the accounting and statistics classes, I got A's in them, but they were a little harder than the others.  But I worked hard for my--I mean I wasn't, it wasn't as if it came very easy; I had to work at it.  I studied a lot and spent a lot of time, but I knew what I needed to do get an A.  Even if it was only, you know, 90.01, I got the A.  So, you know, I just knew what I needed to do to be successful.  And I just worked with the professors and worked with the tutors.  Anything I needed to do to get the grades where they needed to be, I did it.
Speaker 1: Was there anyone there, any of the professors who, that stand out in your mind?
Speaker 2: You know, Wash U [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri] was a midsized school.  There were about four thousand undergraduates.  The freshmen classes tended to be pretty large.  I was actually in the business school, so some of our freshmen classes were good sized, a couple hundred; good sized by standards back then.  So, I didn't really have relationships with the professors at that age, I mean at that stage, my freshman year.  There were a couple of courses that I had that really had an impact on me.  I took a writing course in business school my freshman and sophomore year that for whatever reason sticks with me to this day.  And it really focused on writing very crisp and tight, and learning how to cut out excess words.  And there was this theory, and I don't remember what it was called.  But I just remember even now when I review my writing, I edit myself, and I, you know, rewrite things to cut out the number of words and to be more succinct and precise as a result of this class that I had when I was in college.  In terms of people, there was a woman who was in administration there, Adrienne Galore [ph.], who really sort of took in--there were very few black students or African American students at the college.  And so she was sort of the counselor or administrator that was responsible for the African American students, and she was very encouraging and supportive.  And then there was the activities director, I think was his title, an African American male who had graduated from the university who was there, and whose job was to ensure that all the activities on the university, the student activities, ran smoothly.  And so he was very much connected to the African American community.
Story_ID: 608489
Speaker 1: I think the thing that stuck out for me when I went to Wash U [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri], was it was the first time that I took black history classes.  And so it was, you know, growing up in Kansas you really didn't get into the race issue much, because it was just very--we just didn't have issues.  So, you really didn't think about race much.  And so it wasn't until I went to college that the race issue began to be more prominent.  And Washington University had a black studies program, and for many years there had been kind of an ongoing issue on campus about why the black studies program hadn't been elevated toward department status, and that some of the people who taught in the program be given, become professors at the university.  And so I became sort of a campus radical.  I began to get involved in the black studies, in the black students association, and was an officer in the black students association, and was active in the business school student council.  I just ran for office my sophomore year, and was treasurer of the South 40, which was the area of land that housed all of the dormitories and all of the housing areas.  And so we had our own student government for that area of land.  And so I was the treasurer, and my responsibility was to rent cars to the students, which as a lawyer, looking back on it now, the liability must have been tremendous.  And I don't know how they allowed us to do it, but the student government owned two little cars.  And we used to have a rental process, if you needed to rent a car to go out to the grocery store or whatever.  And so my responsibility was to run that program.  So I was, I was involved pretty much all throughout.
Speaker 2: Well, tell me about the campus.  You had to rent a car to go do errands.  I mean this was a vast community, I mean, campus, or--?
Speaker 1: Well, the campus was pretty confined in St. Louis [Missouri].  It was in the city right at the foot of a large park that was a citywide park.  It was very expansive in St. Louis, a beautiful campus, a traditional quad based campus with brick buildings all around, and then there was a section to the back.  But most of the students on campus did not have cars.  Most of them came from other parts of the country, and it was very much a residential campus; they lived on campus.  And so if you wanted to go out to go shopping or to go the mall or go to the movies, it was a little bit far away.  And there wasn't a real strong transportation system with their public bus service, so you could rent a car to go out to the mall or to go to the grocery store, something like that, or take somebody out on a date, you know, that kind of thing.  So that's how it was set up.  But we pretty much all lived on campus, and had a pretty tight knit community on campus.
Speaker 2: So, you got along with everyone.  You were used to being around--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --white people?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: So, that wasn't any issue for you at all?
Speaker 1: No, not at all.  I mean like I said, we were, we tried to be little radicals, but the most radical thing we did was we protested at a homecoming.  Now mind you, Washington University is known for its academics and not sports.  You know, the kids would, the boys would miss football practice at a heartbeat to study for the pre-med exam, or something like that.  So, our homecoming was not that big of a deal, but we protested at a homecoming.  While all the black students got to the field early and sat, it was a big sign that said, "Black students at Washington, you have nothing to cheer about."  And that was the level of our protest.  And so, we had this manifesto of issues and concerns that I think had been passed down from like the last ten years that we presented our concerns to the administration.  I will say that since that time the university has made an effort to be more diverse and has quite a few scholarships for African American students, and I think the numbers increased substantially after the years I was there.  But I think there might have been twenty or thirty African Americans in the undergraduate school when I was there, but there were very few, yeah.
Speaker 2: Anything else of interest during your undergraduate years?
Speaker 1: There were twenty-three in my class, let me clarify that; in my class.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, yeah.
Speaker 2: Did anything else happen during the time, during your undergrad years that stand out in your mind?
Speaker 1: Not really.  I mean I was just, I was, again, very involved in the student activities and very involved in the campus, and planning for law school.
Story_ID: 608490
Speaker 1: I understand there was no issue with race.  And your parents [Donna Mitchell Plummer and Louis Plummer, Jr.], I didn't ask you whether they were involved in civil rights.  That's not during your time of growing up, but as far as in your household, were your parents political?  I mean was it something that they talked about, as far as voting?  And do you remember the first time that you voted?
Speaker 2: I remember the first time I voted, but it--I didn't get any of that from my parents.  They weren't particularly political.  My grandfather [Louis Plummer, Sr.], who was the debater, would debate all sorts of issues, and so he certainly debated political issues.  But I don't remember our family being particularly politically sensitive, at least not that they exposed to me.  My parents were educators.  They talked a lot about the school system and, you know, education, and focused on that, but not particularly involved in local politics or in, you know, national issues to any degree.
Story_ID: 608491
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, tell me what you had to go through to prepare for law school.
Speaker 2: My priority was getting good grades in college so that I could apply to law school.  And I pretty much was set on going to law school.  I think there was only one point and time where I received an offer my senior year, a job offer from Boston Consulting [Boston Consulting Group] to get an M.B.A. and to go to work for them for a year, and then go back and get my M.B.A.  And I waivered for a minute, and then ultimately decided that I wanted to go back to law school.  I applied to about eight schools, and I was accepted to all of them.  And the reason why I chose Emory University [Emory University School of Law, Atlanta, Georgia] was because of the scholarship money.  I had, my senior year, my junior and senior year, it became very difficult for my parents [Donna Mitchell Plummer and Louis Plummer, Jr.] to help pay for the expenses at Washington University [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri].  It was very expensive, and the scholarship increases were not commensurate with the increase in the tuition and expenses.  So by my senior year, it was a pretty significant stretch for my parents to be able to pay for college.  And so when I went to law school, I needed to go someplace where I could be assured that I would be covered the entire period of law school.  So, I didn't want to have to go through another fairly tense year of trying to figure out where tuition money was going to come from.  So, although Emory wasn't necessarily my first choice, it was financially my first choice.  (Laughter) They gave me a full tuition scholarship, and so all I had to do was come up with was room and board.  And so I took out loans and worked to pay for that.
Speaker 1: What was your first choice?
Speaker 2: Duke [Duke University School of Law, Durham, North Carolina], yeah.  And I was accepted to Duke and they gave me a scholarship, but their scholarship decreased.  You got a lot the first year, a little bit less the second year, and then a little bit less the third year, with the thought process being that you would get a nice summer internship with a nice law firm and be able to make up the difference in that.  And I didn't want to take any chances.  I just, I wanted it to be clear that I could, was paying for those three years so I wouldn't have to struggle through trying to come up tuition money.  The only other thing that was an influence that helped me I think in terms of my law school admittance was the internship program through INROADS.  I had worked all four summers at Hallmark Cards [Hallmark Cards, Inc.].  I had very substantive job responsibilities for a college student.  I was in the party planning unit and learned how they planned party products.  I worked in market research and came up with a computer programming--not a computer program--but I was working with them on programmable computers and a system to monitor inventory through the computer register as sales were made.  I did market research, and one summer I worked in the legal department at Hallmark Cards and got to see how they handled legal issues.  So, I think those experiences working for Hallmark during those years helped me when I applied to law school, because it gave me I think some appreciation for the business environment that other students might not have had.  And my goal all along was to go to law school and work in a way in which--work in an environment in which I was advising businesses on how to comply with laws and regulations.  I think I picked that up from having worked with Hallmark, in terms of understanding all the laws and regulations that they had to follow in order to produce products, whether it's dye on some sort of kid's toy that was going to be used.  Because stickers were really big back then, and the kids were all into these stickers.  And so, Hallmark used to produce these big sticker albums.  And we had to be careful about what kind of dye was used for the stickers, because the kids had a tendency to put stickers all over their face in and their mouth.  And so I just became aware of regulations that companies had to follow in order to produce products.  And so I decided when I went to law school that that's what I wanted to do, was in some way work in some sort of setting where I was helping companies learn how to comply with government regulations so that they could be profitable but yet be compliant.
Story_ID: 608492
Speaker 1: Emory University in Atlanta [Emory University School of Law, Atlanta, Georgia].  And tell me about the process of moving from Washington.  I mean, you know--
Speaker 2: From St. Louis [Missouri]?
Speaker 1: --from St. Louis and Washington University [Washington University in St. Louis] to Atlanta [Georgia] now.
Speaker 2: I'd only been in Atlanta one time prior to that, and it, again, was one of those aha moments where I was--I'd say in high school [Sumner Academy of Arts and Science, Kansas City, Kansas], my grandmother passed away.  And my grandfather [Louis Plummer, Sr.] and my grandmother [Verona Plummer] on the Plummer side were big bridge players, and they used to always travel around the country playing in bridge tournaments.  And so my grandfather wanted to go to a bridge tournament in Atlanta.  So he and his sister, my aunt, my great aunt--and I had just gotten my driver's license, so I helped them drive to Atlanta from Kansas City, and went on this trip with him after my grandmother died.  And it was like I had woke up and gone to--I had never seen so many black people in my entire life.  I mean it was, it was like, oh, man, you have black people working in the hotels, and there were black people working at the amusement parks, and there were black people-- You just didn't see that in Kansas.  (Laughter) So it was like, I'm going back to Atlanta.  So that was one of the reasons I applied to Emory because I thought, wow, it would be nice to go back to Atlanta.  And so after I got admitted to Emory, I didn't go back to visit the school.  I didn't even know what it looked like until it was time to go to law school.  And I drove down to try to find a place to live, and I ended up rooming with a girl who was a third year law student who just happened to have an empty apartment available.  And I met her off the board at the law school office, and then started law school at Emory.
Speaker 1: And what was her name?
Speaker 2: Catharina Dubbelday [Catharina Dubbelday Haynes].  She's actually a judge in the Fifth Circuit appellate court [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit] right now.  We still keep in touch, and she was appointed a judge not too long ago.
Speaker 1: So, was law school all that you thought it would be, or more?
Speaker 2: It was nothing like I thought it would be; I had no clue.  I mean, although my grandfather was a lawyer, you know, it was local, you know, local law.  You know, write a will, somebody's dog got, you know, captured by the pound or--you know, it was just local stuff.  So, I really didn't have a clue of how to study law or what to do.  And it was a challenge for me the first year to understand the differences between law school and undergrad.  And the old sayings about law school are accurate: the first year they scare you to death, the second year they work you to death, and the third year they bore you to death.  That was pretty much my experience at law school.
Speaker 1: So you entered in 1988?  Is that the year you graduated from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I graduated in '85 [1985] from--
Speaker 1: In '85 [1985].
Speaker 2: --Washington University.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And entered law school in '85 [1985].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then graduated from law school in '88 [1988].
Story_ID: 608493
Speaker 1: So let's talk more about what you found when you got to law school.  You said it was nothing like you thought?
Speaker 2: Yeah, many of the law schools back at that point and time had sort of orientation programs for minority students because they were, I guess, making a greater effort to recruit more minority students to the law schools.  So Emory [Emory University School of Law, Atlanta, Georgia] had such a program, which I attended a week or so before the regular orientation for students.  And I remember distinctly having graduates from Emory University and others who were responsible for this orientation program telling me that black students at Emory don't do well.  And I thought, well, that's kind of strange.  But it was just repeated over and over and over again.  So, I'm like, "Okay, well, I'm still going to do my best.  I can do this."  So, I get into my first semester of law school, and I didn't do well.  And largely, I don't think it had anything to do with me being black.  I think it just had to do with me--I just didn't understand how to study in law school.  It was just a different concept.  You had one test at the end of the year, and I just hadn't gotten it.  And so, I didn't do well.  And a lot of the African American students did not do well that first semester.  And so there became a real divide between those that said, "Okay, I'm going to figure this out and I'm going to be successful," and those who said, "You know, well, I'm going to stop trying, because there's no real reason to.  Because blacks at Emory don't do well, because you all just told me that black students at Emory don't do well."  And so in the past I was very close, as an undergrad [at Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri], to the other black students.  But at that point I had to kind of distance myself from that kind of thinking, because I didn't want, I didn't want to get sucked into that kind of mentality, that said no matter how hard I do, just because I'm black I'm not going to be successful.  And so I really had to just buckle down and figure out how to do it myself, and so I didn't have a lot of interaction with the Black Law Students Association [National Black Law Students Association (NBLSA)].  After my first year I just kind of went to class and studied and did my own thing, and just tried to figure out how to be successful, and I did better than I had the previous years.  But as a result I didn't develop a lot of relationships, not only with the black students, but really with anybody; I was just very much focused on school.  And part of that also is I met my husband to be [Roderick McClure] my second year of law school.  And so what free time I had, I spent with him and his family, who were in Atlanta [Georgia].  And so--
Speaker 1: You said--okay, but the first year you were involved with the Black Law Students Association?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What did they do?  What, what--
Speaker 2: Well, it was supposed to be sort of a support group--
Speaker 1: What was the organization for?
Speaker 2: --for black law students, you know, maybe give out outlines; help each other with outlines; kind of give you sort of the in on the school and the professors and the teachers.  We did community service projects.  We reached back out to some of the undergraduate students who were thinking about going to law school.  So, it was sort of like a support group for African American students in the law school.
Speaker 1: But was that the group you were getting this negative energy from?
Speaker 2: After the first year.  After our first year, and yeah, I guess even during the first year, when they kept telling you that black students at Emory don't do well.  Because it kind of became kind of a bitter group, you know.  And I've since gone back to Emory and told the students in the black law school association there how I felt.  And they say it's changed since then.  (Laughter) So, I'm glad to hear that.  But it wasn't then (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 608494
Speaker 1: What about the Moot Court Society?  Were you involved with that?
Speaker 2: I was.  I did do moot court.  And--
Speaker 1: What was that experience like?
Speaker 2: It was fun.  I mean I think I determined I liked the oral advocacy piece of the legal profession.  I thought I would like to be a litigator; I enjoyed being in court.  It was part of the speech that I had had affinity to, and the debates.  So, it was just an extension from my experiences in high school [Sumner Academy of Arts and Science, Kansas City, Kansas] with speech and debate.  And I liked that part of it, and was very active with the moot court program at Emory [Emory University School of Law, Atlanta, Georgia] and did moot court competitions and things of that nature.
Story_ID: 608495
Speaker 1: You said you met your husband to be.
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: And what was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Roderick [Roderick McClure].
Speaker 1: Or is.
Speaker 2: Is.  We met at a, actually at a church singles conference.  And neither one of us had planned on being there.  And his friends kept calling him and saying, "You need to come, you need to come."  And my friends kept calling me saying, "Oh, why don't you go?  We need a ride."  (Laughter) And so at the last minute I decided to go, and he decided to go.  And we happened to meet at a picnic, or what was supposed to have been a picnic.  And we started dating shortly thereafter, and dated for a couple of years and then we got married after I graduated from law school [Emory University School of Law, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what does he do?
Speaker 2: Right now, he's a pastor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's a pastor of a church.
Speaker 1: Which church?
Speaker 2: It's called Power in Christ Ministries.
Speaker 1: And it's in Atlanta [Georgia], or (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In, in Union City, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Union City?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 608496
Speaker 1: Let's just talk a little bit more, if you have more to talk about, about law school [Emory University School of Law, Atlanta, Georgia], about the classes that you were taking.  You know, you took charge and said, you know, I'm going to make this work.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So what did you do differently to, you know, to up your study skills so that you could do well the next couple of years?
Speaker 2: I really talked to other people who were doing better, and talked to the professors and tried to figure out, you know, what I was, what I needed to do differently to be successful.  And a lot of it was I really kind of, I got it the second time around, you know.  I didn't understand how I needed to study the first time, but after the first set of exams, I sort of saw what they were looking for, and understood how to take notes during the year, and how to stay up on top of things that the teachers were sharing with you.  And I think I just, you know, I got it better the second time around.  So I just spent more time doing what we needed to do to stay on top of the material, and to anticipate the questions that the professors were going to ask a little better.
Story_ID: 608497
Speaker 1: So, to continue in law school [Emory University School of Law, Atlanta, Georgia].  Talk about that wonderful day when it's time to graduate.
Speaker 2: Well, let me take you back a little bit.  I think you probably know the way law school works.  You try to get a job during your, between your school years, between the first and second summer, and the second and third summer.  And the job that hopefully you get between the second and third summer, if you do a good job on it, then they'll make you a permanent job offer at the end of your second year.  And so if you're lucky going into your third year of law school, you already have a job.  So that was a goal for all law school students there, was to go into your third year of law school with a job.  My first year of law school, and this is an interesting story, I hate to delay it.  But I told you I didn't do that well, but I was able to get a very good job in between my first and second year back in Kansas.  Because my grandmother's best friend was a housekeeper, I guess, or sort of an aide at a very large white law firm in Kansas City, Missouri, and he didn't have any blacks at this law firm.  And so she had developed a relationship with the senior partner.  She was one of the people that, you know, kept the coffee and the tea and, you know, kept the food in the cabinets lined up well.  And so she developed a, after many years of working at this law firm, developed a relationship with the senior partner of the law firm and started talking to him about me when I was in law school, or actually probably when I was in college [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri], saying that, "She's going to law school, and you really need to bring her to work at this firm and everything."  And so when I got to the point where I was applying for jobs, trying to find a job after my first year, I started early before I got my grades back from my first year of law school.  I started applying for jobs, and applied for a job at this law firm where my grandmother's best friend worked.  And they called me in and made me an offer to come and work, without having seen my grades.  And so I came in as one of a few first years.  Most of their summer programs, summer internships, were for second year law students, but they brought in a couple of first year law students.  So, I was one of the first year law students that they brought in.  As far as I know, I was the first black student that they had ever brought into this firm, but it was a large firm in Kansas City; Kansas City, Missouri.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the law firm?
Speaker 2: Stinson, Mag, and Fizzell [Stinson Leonard Street LLP] was the name of the firm.  I'm not sure if it's still in existence in that name now, but it was then.  And so, I had a great summer.  I worked at the law firm there and got a real experience of what it was like to work at a law firm.  My second year, it was much more difficult.  The economy was starting to falter a little.  It was much more difficult to get jobs, and I only received one offer coming out of the second year of law school for a summer internship, and it was with a law firm in Atlanta [Georgia] called Ford and Harrison [Ford and Harrison LLP].  So, I took the job there and it happened to be a labor and employment law firm when I had an interest in labor and employment law.  Midway through the summer I got sick and I became severely anemic and had to go into the hospital, and I couldn't finish out the summer because it was also the time of the AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] scare, when we were just learning about AIDS.  And so I couldn't, my mom [Donna Mitchell Plummer] didn't want me to get a blood transfusion in order to regain my blood count after I became severely anemic.  And so I ended up having to stay off the rest of the summer and just build my blood cell count back up normally, which was just to rest, and iron shots, and things of that nature.  Long story short, I didn't think they were going to make me an offer, because I was only there for a short period of time.  But at the end of the summer before I started my second year of law school--my third year of law school--they made me a permanent job offer.  So, I went into my third year of law school with a job offer already in place.  So, when I say that they work you to death your second year and that they bored you to death, I was really bored, because I already had a job at that point, so I didn't really care.  (Laughter) As far as I know, they didn't ask what your grades were your third year, because they had already made you the offer.  So, I practiced, I studied for the bar my third year of law school.  In Georgia at that time, you could take the bar exam during your third year of law school.  So I took the bar exam my third year of law school, so when I graduated from law school I found out that same day that I had also passed the Georgia bar exam.  So, I was done.  (Laughter) So, I was very happy at that point.  So I didn't take much time off, went on a quick vacation, and then started to work at Ford and Harrison.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that was labor law you said?
Speaker 2: Yes, labor and employment law (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And la- okay.
Story_ID: 608498
Speaker 1: Tell me about that.  And what did you actually do?  I mean what type of cases do you remember?
Speaker 2: It was a traditional labor and employment firm, so we represent management.  And the unique thing about that is I recall being interviewed by one of the partners in the law firm when I was interviewing for the job.  And they asked me a question, "How do you as a black person think that you could work representing management on discrimination and union related issues?"  And my answer was, and I still believe that to this day, that my hope would be that I could advise the company to do the right thing on the front end so that they would avoid having a lawsuit on the back end for discriminating against someone.  So they thought that was a good response, and that's why I chose to represent management as opposed to being on the side where you're always suing the company for discrimination.  So, that's what we did.  We represented companies in matters of EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] discrimination, state and federal discrimination laws, and then union organization, helping them deal with the unions, either if the unions were trying to organize or if there was already a union contract in place up unto negotiating the union contract.  So in my early stages there was a lot of research, and a lot of time and energy in the library researching and preparing statements and papers and research reports for the lawyers in the law firm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how long did you stay at that firm?
Speaker 2: Two and a half, three years I stayed at Ford Harrison [Ford and Harrison LLP].  And as an aside, my third year in law school [Emory University School of Law, Atlanta, Georgia], I worked for another firm, Smith, Currie, and Hancock [Smith, Currie, and Hancock LLP].  But they had made a deal with Ford Harrison not to recruit me away, because I'd already accepted a job with Ford Harrison.  But three years later they came back and said, "Okay, the deal is off.  You've worked for Ford Harrison for three years.  Now would you come and work for us?"  And so about that time I was thinking about making a move for various reasons, and so it made sense.  So, I ended up going to work for this firm that I had worked for my third year in law school.  And again it was doing labor and employment work.
Speaker 1: And you were married now [to Roderick McClure]?
Speaker 2: I was married, yes.
Speaker 1: Any children yet?
Speaker 2: I had my first child while at the second law firm, Smith, Currie, and Hancock; my little girl, Kristin [Kristin McClure].
Speaker 1: And what year was she born?
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety-two [1992].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you worked at the first law firm until 19--you tell me (laughter).
Speaker 2: Probably '91 [1991].
Speaker 1: Ninety-one [1991].
Speaker 2: Yeah, '91 [1991], '92 [1992] timeframe.  And then I had Kristin in late '92 [1992].  So, that's about right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what happens--
Speaker 2: Ninety-one [1991].
Speaker 1: So, what happens next?  How long do you stay there?
Speaker 2: About another three years or so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, what are you thinking now as far as--are you ready to leave?  What makes you decide that you want to do something different?
Speaker 2: Well, I enjoyed the practice, and I had some great experiences.  It was a smaller labor and employment practice, but they had quite a bit of work.  And so I was able to try my first case with that firm, and got a great deal of experience.  They just kind of let you go.  As much as you could handle, they threw it at you.  And as long as you didn't fall, they kept throwing it at you.  So, I got a lot of training and a lot of opportunities at that firm.  But it had a unique partnership structure, for lots of different reasons.  I wasn't sure that I wanted to actually be a partner in that firm, and so at some point one of the attorneys who had left the firm prior to, you know, a couple of years prior, called me and said that she was aware of another firm that was looking to build its labor and employment practice, and would I be interested in talking to that firm [Troutman Sanders LLP].  And it happened to be one of the largest firms in the city.  So, I actually went from a small firm to a midsized firm to a large firm, and then ultimately took the job with this large firm in the city to help them build their practice.
Story_ID: 608499
Speaker 1: At the first [Ford and Harrison LLP], second [Smith, Currie, and Hancock LLP], or third [Troutman Sanders LLP] law firm that you worked for, were there other women attorneys there?  And were there any other black women?
Speaker 2: At the first law firm, there was one African American woman.  She was the first African American woman at the firm, the first African American, period, at the firm.  And she was there my first year, and then she left. She was not happy there and had some issues and felt like she wanted to pursue opportunities elsewhere.  The second firm that I worked for, there were two other women.  And that was sort of, it was a traditional labor firm more so, and a construction firm.  So, it was very heavily male industries that we were working in.  And I just remember they did not have a maternity leave policy.  It was prior to my becoming pregnant [with Kristin McClure], and so it had to have been '91 [1991] when I went there.  And I recall that the three women at the firm, we got together and decided we were going to ask for a maternity leave policy.  And none of us were pregnant at the time, but we wanted to know what our benefits would be or what we would be subjected to if we did become pregnant.  And I remember going to the partner, and we presented this request for a pregnancy leave policy.  And this one partner pulled me aside and said, "Why are you associating with those other women?  We'll take care of you, you know.  You'll be okay.  Don't ask these questions."  (Laughter) And it was like, "Look, I just want to know.  I'm not pregnant, you know.  We just need to know for planning purposes."  But that was their first, they had not had a lot of interaction with women attorneys at that firm, and so it was a learning experience all the way around.  But otherwise they treated me well, and they did take care of me and was very encouraging.  They gave me a lot of work, and so otherwise it was a good firm.
Speaker 1: Did they put a policy in place?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: After we asked, they did.
Story_ID: 608500
Speaker 1: Is this the same firm that you did your first trial?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And do you remember what the trial was about?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My first trial was an age discrimination case in Augusta, Georgia.  And the partner that gave me the opportunity to try the case was probably one of my mentors throughout the course of my time at that firm, and even later.  A great guy, he just was willing to expose me to whatever I was able to handle.  And actually I was preparing the case for him to try, and pretty much at the last minute he said, "Well, you know the case.  You try it."
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Tom Kilpatrick.
Speaker 1: And tell me the name of this law firm one more time.
Speaker 2: Smith, Currie, and Hancock [Smith, Currie, and Hancock LLP].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so the trial, tell me about the trial.
Speaker 2: The trial was an age discrimination case.  It was a merger of a bank that resulted in some employees being laid off.  And one of the employees laid off, he had worked for the bank for some time.  His father had worked for the bank, and they had a long history with the bank.  And one of the reasons that he was laid off is because he didn't have the skillset that the bank needed going forward.  They were going to be moving to a lot of technology and they were starting to implement technology into the banking system, and he just didn't catch on.  And so, he was ultimately let go.  He filed a lawsuit claiming that it was age discrimination, and the defense was no, it was just that he wasn't capable of handling the technology that the bank was moving towards.  And I just recall that the, it was a jury trial, and there was a lawyer that ended up being the foreman of the jury.  And he told me afterwards that the other side had struck most of the African Americans from the jury, thinking that they would relate to me as the attorney.  And they left him on the jury, which is typically a mistake.  You typically don't leave a lawyer in the jury room with them, because they're going to tell--everybody's going to defer to that person, thinking that he knows the law.  And so, but they made a mistake and left him on the jury, and he actually became the foreperson for the jury.  And he said, "You know, it's a good thing I was in there, because they felt very sorry for this guy.  But I kept having to point out to him that although they felt sorry for him, there was, you know, there was no evidence that the company violated the law."  And so that's how I was able to win the case, because he kept them on track, and they deferred to his opinion.  So, it was interesting, yeah.
Story_ID: 608501
Speaker 1: Now you move to a larger firm?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And what firm is this?
Speaker 2: Troutman Sanders [Troutman Sanders LLP].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what type of law?
Speaker 2: Still labor and employment law.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so how does, how do your duties change?
Speaker 2: It was only different in the respect that I was working for a much larger firm; they had very large clients.  It was an old long term Georgia firm.  Governor Carl Sanders was one of the named partners in the firm, and he, although retired from the practice of law, still had an office in the firm on the fifty-fourth floor.  And he still came in periodically and was very old school Georgia with his seersucker suit and bowtie, and knew everybody in the state and in the city [Atlanta, Georgia].  And so, it was a little bit of a change in dynamics; it was very much an old school firm.  So, internal firm politics became an issue that I had never dealt with before that was very prevalent in the firm.  And billing issues, and developing clients, all those things became very significant factors.  It wasn't just about practicing law, but it was all these other things that were part of the job as well.  And I didn't like it as much because of that.  I liked the practice of law, I liked being involved with the clients; I liked trying cases.  I wasn't as much concerned about billable hours, and politics, and becoming a partner, and all that sort of stuff.  But it was interesting, I learned a lot.
Speaker 1: What was the most important thing that you learned there?
Speaker 2: That your partners don't always trust each other, and that you need to be in a relationship where you trust the people that you work with, because you can--you ultimately have to sometimes deal with the consequences of their actions if you don't trust them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, how long do you stay there?
Speaker 2: I stayed there for about four years.
Story_ID: 608502
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In 1995, I had just had my second daughter.  She was born in July, and while I was on maternity leave, actually I received a call from a partner who had worked at Smith, Currie, and Hancock [Smith, Currie, and Hancock LLP] who knew that UPS [United Parcel Service] was looking for an attorney that had kind of my skillsets.  So he called me and said, "Hey, I don't know if you're happy at your job, but UPS is looking for an in house attorney with the background that's similar to yours.  And if I was ten years younger, I'd take the job and buy a lot of stock, but I'm not in a position to do that.  But I'd like to submit your name."  And I said, "Sure, why not?"  So, when I came back from maternity leave, things were going pretty well.  But I started talking to UPS about potentially going to UPS, and was sort of at the crossroads, where I had to decide whether or not I was going to stay on with the law firm and go through the partnership process and try to become a partner with the law firm and have a career path in that direction, or change my career path totally and go to work in house with this corporation, which at that point I didn't know a lot about.  You know, I'd heard of the company and had seen the brown truck, but didn't know much about it.  I didn't know how big it was, and didn't realize they were headquartered in Atlanta [Georgia].  I had one case with them when I was at Smith, Currie, but I wasn't directly involved.  But the more I looked into it and the more I looked at balancing family commitments--and my husband was starting his own business, and there were a lot of dynamics that were going on.  And most importantly, I realized I didn't want to be a partner in a law firm as much as I thought that I had.  And I really did--going back to why I went to law school [Emory University School of Law, Atlanta, Georgia]--I really did want to be in a situation where I was advising businesses on how to comply with the law.  And I felt like I could do that better in house than I was able to do that as an outside attorney.  Because so often we were just getting involved after the fact; after there was already a dispute, after decisions had already been made, and we're trying to clean them up as opposed to being able to advise in advance.  And that's the piece of the law, the practice of law that I like the most.  So, I went to UPS.
Speaker 2: Now, once again, what is your second daughter's name?
Speaker 1: Morgan [Morgan McClure].
Speaker 2: Morgan.  And she was born in--?
Speaker 1: July, 1995.
Story_ID: 608503
Speaker 1: When you go to UPS [United Parcel Service]--when you come to UPS, I should say--what do you think you would find?
Speaker 2: I really didn't know.  I knew that I was coming to practice labor and employment law.  I knew that it was a large company, had over two hundred thousand employees, and that there were a lot of issues.  There were a number of new labor and employment laws that had just passed.  The Americans with Disabilities Act [Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990] and the Civil Rights Act [Civil Rights Act of 1991] had passed recently.  And so the company was becoming, you know, developing policies and procedures to comply with these laws, and I'd been involved in a lot of that on the outside.  So I was, you know, thinking it was going to be a great place to work, and I could better balance family commitments and the job and everything, and be able to be in a position where I could advise the company and hopefully keep them out of litigation, as opposed to litigating.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And before we talk more about your positions at UPS, you said your husband [Roderick McClure] was beginning a business.  What type of business did he start?
Speaker 2: He has a, it's a copy company, but they do document production for law firms.  Basically when a law firm has a big case and they have to have all sorts of documents copied, they don't send it to a Kinko's or some small copy center.  They send it to these large companies that just do mass copies for litigation purposes.  And so he started a company that did that, that supported law firms in sort of this copying business, and had about fifteen employees doing that.
Speaker 1: Can you give us a little history about UPS?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  UPS was started in 1907, and it's a hundred and something years old, 103 years old now.  It was started by a seventeen year old kid, young man, who started a messenger service.  And the messenger service ultimately turned into a delivery service for clothing stores in the northeast area of Portland, Oregon.  I mean Seattle, Washington is where the company started, but ultimately expanded into California and the Northeast.  But he was delivering packages for department stores, and went from that to delivering furniture, and ultimately became a broad based delivery company and just started to expand services across the country.  So when I joined UPS in 1995, there were about two hundred thousand employees.  They had started international operations and were just growing internationally, and was starting to look at acquiring other types of businesses and go into other forms of business.  And ultimately in the next several years we would acquire a logistics business, a freight forwarding business, expand the airline business, and do more work internationally.
Speaker 1: You say the airline business.  UPS Airlines was started back in the '80s [1980s], the 1980s?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, that's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was growing and expanding in the '90s [1990s] when I came on board, and was really becoming a big part of the business in the early '90s [1990s].
Speaker 1: Well, this airline was just for shipping packages, right?
Speaker 2: Right, but it's a formal airline.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It's actually the ninth largest airline in the country right now, over two hundred airplanes.  But all of them ship packages and cargo, and no people (laughter).
Story_ID: 608504
Speaker 1: Tell me about your tenure here [United Parcel Service].  Because you've been here since 1995.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Talk to me, step me through the different positions and responsibilities.
Speaker 2: Sure.  The gentleman that hired me was Allen Hill, he was the department manager at the time.  He had previously been a labor and employment attorney, and actually he hired me to take his job when he got promoted to department manager.  And so I came on as one of two labor and employment attorneys, primarily focusing on employment issues, and there was a young man who was responsible for the labor issues.  I was surprised immediately by the scope of the job when I came on.  Because we had literally two hundred thousand employees, and I was the only employment attorney, and there was one labor attorney.  It didn't make sense to me.  (Laughter) As I got deeper into the job, I just realized how big the job was.  I mean, we had litigation all across the country.  We relied very heavily on outside counsel.  We didn't have really good accounting systems in place to monitor the litigation, so it was just a very, very big job.  And so, much of it was being done by outside counsel that I thought could have been done in house--so much of the advice and counseling.  And I started to just look at ways to try to improve, you know, the environment.  So ultimately I convinced them that this was a job that if we really--with all these new labor laws that were coming out and new employment laws, that there was potentially a great risk to the organization, given the size of the company and the number of employees, if we didn't comply with these laws in the right way.  So, I was able to convince them that in order to do that, and to advise the company appropriately, we needed more attorneys to help give guidance and direction to the HR [human resources] function and to the labor guys on labor and employment issues.  So, I eventually convinced them that we needed to hire more attorneys and to create a whole group that did nothing but labor and employment related issues.  Because also, the employment--the spend with outside counsel was the largest on these labor and employment cases.  And so, if we wanted to kind of reduce that spend, we needed do more in house.  And so it was after I made this proposal that I was eventually promoted to head up a labor and employment group and hired some additional labor and employment attorneys and started to work more closely with the HR group on helping them comply with the laws and to develop policies and procedures and ensure that the company was compliant with the law.  And so then I just started to take on more and more responsibility within the legal department; managing the outside counsel network, managing our technology and office administration, and just took on, you know, more and more responsibility outside of labor and employment over the years as I worked there.
Story_ID: 608505
Speaker 1: And then at some point in time, my manager came to me, the head of the legal department, and said, "You know, if you really are looking to have a long term career with UPS [United Parcel Service], and to expand your potential for being considered for other positions at UPS, you probably need to go into the operations and get an understanding of the operations of the business."  So, after much debate back and forth with my husband [Roderick McClure], we determined that we would accept an assignment to relocate.  And we relocated our family to Orlando [Florida], where I took on responsibility for our package operation that had about four thousand employees at that time, and learned how to move packages in brown trucks.  I ran the operation from top to bottom, and just really learned how the business operated at the very basic, the very front lines level.  And it was a tremendous opportunity and a challenging opportunity (laughter) for someone who had no experience in that, to get thrown into that environment.  But I did, they gave me a little training in advance, and then I had a lot of help from people that worked in the area on the ground before.
Speaker 2: Well, as you were coming up through the ranks, I should say, technology was also a big part of, you know, modernizing the company.  And I got a sense that the internal controls weren't where they needed to be.  Was that a big part of something that you did while you were learning the operations?
Speaker 1: That was more while I was in the legal department in terms of--
Speaker 2: While you were in legal?
Speaker 1: Yeah, while I was in legal, in terms of--well, in terms of--for the legal department, we moved to three or four different types of database technology systems that helped us track our spending, you know; electronic billing, and case management that helped us manage our cases better, and then do analytics on the amount of money that we spend with our outside counsel to better determine how we can reduce costs.  So, part of my technology piece was managing the technology that was purchased and implemented to better manage the scope of spend on legal related matters--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and to better manage the outside counsel who were representing us.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And so, how long did you stay in Orlando?
Speaker 1: For about a year.  I worked there and then took an assignment in a new area of the company, which was the supply chain logistics piece.  We acquired in the last few years and prior to that a number of supply chain logistics companies, and we were busy integrating those into our overall business.  And so I spent some time on special assignment in the supply chain logistics group.  And then went into the compliance group, heading up the compliance program in the compliance department.  I worked there for a while, and then while on my way back to legal as--by that time the gentleman that was head of the legal department was promoted to general counsel, and I took over his job as head of the legal department.
Speaker 2: Do you remember what year that was?
Speaker 1: That was 19--that was 2005; 2004 or 2005 timeframe.
Story_ID: 608506
Speaker 1: Tell me more about what happens, you know, once you take that position over.
Speaker 2: Head of the legal department?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Well, I mean that was pretty much the first time that I had a great deal of exposure to areas outside of labor and employment law.  Certainly when I was elected to vice president in '98 [1998], when I took over head of the labor and employment group, I was primarily focused on labor and employment law, but I also had exposure and dealt with other issues in other areas of the law.  When I took over the legal department that was the first time I had responsibility for areas outside of labor and employment law.  So it was a period of learning, you know, contracts law, commercial law, and corporate governance law.  All the different areas of law that the company [United Parcel Service] had, we had people responsible for them.  So, that was a learning period.  It was a great opportunity and it was good, because I was kind of getting burned out on labor and employment law, and it was good to learn some other areas of the law and their impact on the company.
Story_ID: 608507
Speaker 1: When you went to Orlando [Florida], one thing that my research says that to have a management position like the one that you have, as an operations manager that you had to start by driving a truck.  Is this, is this a true story?
Speaker 2: Typically--in the company [United Parcel Service]?  Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: For the most part, yes.
Speaker 1: So were people resentful that, you know, that you were coming from Atlanta [Georgia] down there, and now you're in charge?
Speaker 2: It was interesting.  I think there certainly was the potential for that to happen.  I was very sensitive in not wanting that to happen.  But two things kind of helped in that regard.  Number one, the company was looking at different ways to develop managers, senior managers for the organization.  In the past, the traditional method for development of a senior manager was to spend so many years in this job and so many years in this job.  And yes, most of them started out driving a truck, or at the very front lines, and over ten years you would promote your way up.  And what we were finding is that it was taking longer and longer to develop a manager, a district manager, for a senior level management position.  And so, what we started to think about is as the company was growing and we needed to develop people sooner, we needed to look at ways to develop people to take on leadership roles, but who didn't necessarily spend ten to fifteen years growing up, so to speak, in the operations.  So, how can we come up with a process that allows people who have otherwise demonstrated strong leadership skills to go into an operational environment and serve as a leader, although you didn't spend all that time working in the district?  The other thing was the role of the district manager was changing in some respects, and that we were starting to be much more outwardly focused, working with the customers more, being community minded.  And so it was much more a role of a more general leader, as opposed to someone who has strong, a real strong operations background.  Certainly you had to understand the operations, but they were looking to expect more from the district managers than just knowing how to make sure the packages get delivered on time.  So, I was sort of a test case in that regard.  You know, the company was saying, okay, can we just pluck a manager who's been otherwise a good manager in a totally different area of the company out of their area of expertise and put them into an operation and allow them to be successful?  Now, I'm not going to say whether it was successful or not, (laughter) but I can say that over the years, the company has moved more towards a different role for the district manager than just a traditional operations role.  And so I was sort of that, first kind of guinea pig, in that regard.  In order to alleviate the resentment from those who were there, I was very honest when I went in, in saying that, you know, this is what the company is doing.  This is an experiment.  I'm looking at how to develop--I can't do this without you, I'm going to need your help.  I didn't go in acting as if I knew everything and could run the place.  I went in very humbly looking to them to help, and to try to develop personal relationships.  And I think that helped me overcome any potential resistance on a broad scale.  Certainly there were individuals that had their own idea about who should be in that role, but for the most part, I felt that I was warmly embraced by the district, because I wasn't trying to go in, you know, acting like I knew things that I really didn't know.

Speaker 1: In 1999, the company [United Parcel Service] goes public.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And tell me about that.  Does that change the dynamics or the structure of how the company is operated?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, it did.  It was interesting, because I was just getting to a point where I was starting to invest heavily in the company, buying more and more stock.  (Laughter) I just didn't buy enough of it soon enough.  But as a result of the company going public, there was a number of people who were able to retire who had been with the company for many, many years and had acquired a great deal of stock, and became very wealthy when the company went public.  And so, there was a lot of opportunity that opened up when people decided to retire early and leave the organization.  There were changes made in the structure.  There were additional responsibilities placed upon the legal department, because we now had to operate in a heavily regulated environment, being a public company subject to public scrutiny and having to go before, you know, the SEC [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] and having to be subject to the rules of the New York Stock Exchange [New York, New York].  So we, you know, we just had to manage the company differently and create governance processes that allowed us to be a public company.  But it changed in some respects as to how we planned, how we forecasted, how we communicated with our employees, how we communicated with the general public.  And we grew a lot as a company as a result of going public.
Speaker 1: So, you think it was a good decision?
Speaker 2: I, I think there were valid reasons for doing it at the time, you know.  There were others who may argue that there're good reasons to go back to the way it was, because government has gotten so heavy in terms of regulating public companies now.
Speaker 1: Do you know why they decided to go public?
Speaker 2: Well, the theory was that we were going public in order to generate cash in anticipation of doing a major acquisition of some sort, and the company was looking for ways to expand internationally and ways to expand into other areas, and wanted to be able to have the capital to do that.  So, one of the ways to do that was to go public and to generate a lot of cash for that purpose, and we subsequently did make a number of acquisitions from that point and time.
Speaker 1: Do you know which ones were, which--I mean were there major acquisitions made?  Like, I mean, what were they?
Speaker 2: We acquired a logistics company; we acquired a healthcare company; we acquired a freight forwarding company; we acquired a mail innovations company which does, you know, mail delivery of parcels like magazines and things other than letters that aren't as big as packages, kind of.  So we acquired a couple of technology companies, so a number of different acquisitions were made.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, okay, so when you come back from Florida--and did we finish talking about Florida, about when you were in Orlando [Florida] and the work that you did there?  Okay, so in Florida, I guess one of the things there was about redefining the district there or something?
Speaker 2: We redefined the role of the district manager, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, the district manager, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was the rationale for bringing me in.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So we, okay, we talked about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, as opposed to someone who had a long history with the company (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --on the operations side of the business.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now we're back in--
Speaker 2: Back in legal.
Story_ID: 608509
Speaker 1: Back in Atlanta [Georgia], and the person who--you take over his position.  And because you had the previous experience, did it make the job a little easier, or not?
Speaker 2: Well, it was easier in the sense that I was working with people I already knew, very familiar with, that I'd worked with prior to going out into the district.  And so, it was very much home again.  It had been where I had started out with the company.  It was challenging in that, again, I was now responsible for areas of law that I hadn't practiced in previously.  While a large part of our legal budget was spent on labor and employment matters, we also have litigation and other areas; real estate and compliance, and all sorts of areas.  And so, I was learning as well as managing other areas of the company.  So it was challenging and rewarding in that respect, in that I was doing things new, and being exposed to other areas of the company.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you were involved with the UPS Foundation [United Parcel Service Foundation], any part of that?
Speaker 2: At some point.  Actually, I didn't become a trustee in the UPS Foundation until I came to the management committee, until I was promoted to the management committee.  I did at that time become involved with the Annie E. Casey Foundation [Baltimore, Maryland], which is a foundation that was started by our founder, Jim Casey.  Jim Casey didn't have any children when he died, so he left all of his money to a foundation which was named after his mother, Annie E. Casey.  And the Annie E. Casey Foundation is a substantial foundation now, focusing on children's issues and foster care, and advancing the issues.  So when I was head of the legal department I became--some members of UPS [United Parcel Service] serve on the board of the Annie E. Casey Foundation, although it's an independently run organization.  And so, I was elected to the board of the Annie E. Casey Foundation as a UPS representative to the board.
Speaker 1: So, okay, so what year do you become manager, department manager?
Speaker 2: It was, would be two thousand and--
Speaker 1: Five [2005]?
Speaker 2: Two thousand five [2005] and 2006 timeframe, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And just tell me more about what you do, or what you did, or what you hoped to accomplish in that position?
Speaker 2: In that position, I felt when I came into the position there were a number of really structural employee relations issues and communication issues, just as a result of a number of changes that had been made prior to me taking on the role.  And so, my first responsibility was to really build a team to understand the dynamics that were in place, some of the issues that had presented problems in the past, and to sort of bring the team together and create a sense of I guess clarity as such, as to the decision making that was being done that impacted the team members, and just help them feel a greater part of the business process, and not isolate lawyers that worked for the company.  So I spent a great deal of time serving in more of a management role, helping bring the legal department into the fold as part of the business, and helping them view their jobs as advocates on behalf of the business, and educating them in that regard.  So, that was a large part of it at that time.
Story_ID: 608510
Speaker 1: Then what happens in 2006, as far as--you become a senior vice president [at United Parcel Service]?
Speaker 2: Right.  I was promoted to senior vice president and became a member of the managing committee in 2006.
Speaker 1: Two thousand six [2006]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And this makes you the first African American woman, or just the first African American member?
Speaker 2: The first African American woman, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There's one other African American male.  Well, there were a couple, actually, that have been senior vice president of operations.  And then I was the first African American female.
Speaker 1: And in this position, what were some of the things that you hoped to do or accomplish?
Speaker 2: Well, wow.  The position was head of legal compliance, and then ultimately, after about a year I took over responsibility for the public affairs department as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I really wanted to continue some of the things that I had started in the legal department, in terms of positioning the legal department as a facilitator of the business strategy of the business plan.  So many times a legal department can be viewed as an obstacle, like legal says you can't do this and legal says you can't do that.  And so, my goal was to make sure that the lawyers were integrated into the business planning processes early enough to be able to identify issues before it came to a point where we were having to say no to things, and to help the legal teams work around the issues and to be compliant as they're developing their plan, so that we could be a part of the solution as opposed to what--typically the legal department is seen as part of the problem.  So, our goal was to be advocates and to be business partners with the business.  And so that required the lawyers to have a better understanding of the business, and not just be so isolated and focused on the legal issues, which you could very well spend your whole time just working with the outside counsel and looking at the legal issues.  But to be effective for the organization, I moved, I'd like to think that I moved the group more toward being more aligned with the business.
Speaker 1: And is that the position that you hold today?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Now, I'm senior vice president of legal, general counsel, and head of the compliance and public affairs groups.
Story_ID: 608511
Speaker 1: What do you hope to accomplish in the future, in the near future?
Speaker 2: Well, part of my job, although I head up all of those functions, actually a good portion of my job is serving on the senior management team for the company [United Parcel Service].  There are twelve of us who report directly to the--eleven I guess--who report directly to the CEO.  Each of us heads up a functional area, and we are called the management committee.  And so, we make all the strategic decisions for the organization going forward.  And so a lot of what I do now is helping to understand the finances and understanding the strategy and the forecast of the organization, and the market studies and the market plans for the company, and helping facilitate a discussion, a broad based discussion, about where we go next as an organization.  And it's not really legal.  It's much more business oriented than legal.  Certainly legal issues pop in every now and then, and they look to me for guidance and direction, but for the most part, I'm looked upon for business judgment and advocacy on planning, forecasting, and direction for the company long term.  So, my plans now are to continue to understand and grow and learn about the business, and to improve my ability to impact on the finance side of the business.  That's not an area that I traditionally had as much involvement in, but it's one that I'd like to learn more about, but also to be an advocate for the people within the company, ensuring that we as a company are protecting their rights and doing things right by the people, and just working to ensure that the company retains its history of being a very ethically and trustworthy organization, ethically based and trustworthy organization, which is why I stayed with the company for so many years and why I feel like I have a strong--you know, I have a, it's a good fit for me, because the company is really based on doing the right thing.  And for so long it has been one that doesn't want to get close to the line, just wants to walk the straight and narrow and do the right thing and abide by the law, and I can respect that.  And it's comfortable to work in an environment where you know the people around you, you know, are committed to doing the right thing.  They might have to be pushed, and you might have to educate them, but when, you know, the rubber meets the road, they're going to do the right thing; the CEO is going to do the right thing; your partner's going to do the right thing.  And so, you know, that's--my goal, I see is to protect that core company value, from the legal compliance and public affairs standpoint.
Speaker 1: Oh, tell me who the CEO is.
Speaker 2: Scott Davis [D. Scott Davis] is the CEO currently.  He's the second CEO that I've worked for.  The gentleman that promoted me was a CEO by the name of Mike Eskew [Michael L. Eskew].
Story_ID: 608512
Speaker 1: Is there anything else about the business, or what you do, or what you would like to do that you would like to talk about, that we didn't talk about?
Speaker 2: You know, as an African American female, I recognize that I have a lot of visibility in the company [United Parcel Service] from that perspective.  And so, I also want to ensure that the company is sensitive to diversity issues and incorporating really everyone into the organization, and not relying on relationships to make promotion decisions and things of that nature.  So, just ensuring that those remain strong values for the organization.  I do a lot of mentoring, you know, of people within the company and outside of the company who are coming up informally, formally, you know.  I like that part of it.  I like talking to people about what their thoughts are about career strategies and plans, and their future, and helping them work through the challenges that they face in the environment, helping them put their challenges in perspective.  Because sometimes they don't see the big picture.  They don't see all the parts that are at play, and they only see their little piece of it.  And so I like helping them see the bigger picture.  And so, I hope to continue to do that and serve in that capacity.
Story_ID: 608513
Speaker 1: What about other outside organizations?  What other organizations are you affiliated with?
Speaker 2: You know, I've been involved in different organizations over time.  I've always been very active.  Right now, I'm very involved in the Annie E. Casey Foundation [Baltimore, Maryland] and the UPS Foundation [United Parcel Service Foundation].  I also am involved with the Atlanta Legal Aid Society [Atlanta Legal Aid Society, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia].  And then I'm involved with a number of diversity programs in the legal profession that are geared toward trying to improve the diversity of the law profession, both in house counsel and outside counsel, one of which is the Leadership Council for Legal Diversity [sic. Leadership Council on Legal Diversity], which I'm a founding board member of.  I am also involved with my law school, Emory [Emory University School of Law, Atlanta, Georgia], with their Black Law Students Association [National Black Law Students Association (NBLSA)], and I'm on the advisory board for the law school.  And then I recently was on the board of the Children's Healthcare [Children's Healthcare of Atlanta], and I enjoyed doing that.  It was a hospital here in Atlanta [Georgia], and a couple of other local organizations.
Speaker 1: Equal Justice Works [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: That's an organization that I was briefly on the board of, and have been supportive of for many years.  And I've been recognized by them for some of my work.  One of the things that I've done in the legal department is I've established committees to work on diversity within the legal department and within our outside law firms.  Pro bono, I'm a big advocate of lawyers doing pro bono, or volunteer work.  And so we have a very strong pro bono volunteer committee within the legal department that supports the attorneys in doing pro bono work on behalf of agencies and organizations in the Atlanta area.  And we also have a very strong volunteer program that's consistent with what the company does overall in terms of volunteerism.  And so I'm a big proponent of that, and their professionalism.
Speaker 1: And you just received Emory law's Distinguished Alumni Award, right?
Speaker 2: I was.  I was very surprised to learn that.
Speaker 1: Were you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, very much so.
Speaker 1: Why were you surprised?
Speaker 2: Like I said, my experience at Emory wasn't (laughter) necessarily the most positive.  (Laughter) I fought and clawed to get through Emory, but I have a greater appreciation for the university, looking back than I might have at the time I was there.  But overall, I was very pleased with, you know, what I've been able to accomplish, having come from Emory.
Story_ID: 608514
Speaker 1: Would you like to tell me about your daughters?  Because you alluded to one of them was getting ready to go to college.
Speaker 2: Right.  Kristin [Kristin McClure] is my oldest daughter.  She's seventeen, she'll soon be eighteen.  She'll be a senior in high school, and a beautiful young girl and very active, as I was in high school [Sumner Academy of Arts and Science, Kansas City, Kansas].  She's a cheerleader and she plays basketball.  She's much more athletic than I am.  And she runs track and she's on the student council, and she's involved in the pro-life group and a number of other organizations.  And then my youngest daughter, Morgan [Morgan McClure], who is equally as active, runs track, and plays basketball, volleyball, cross country, and student council; probably a little bit more argumentative, she's much more like me.  And the oldest one's a lot like her dad [Roderick McClure].  He's the peacemaker and we're the arguers.  So they picked up on both our personalities.
Story_ID: 608515
Speaker 1: Is there any anything that you would like to talk about that we did not talk about?
Speaker 2: Oh, wow. (Laughter)  Is there anything we didn't talk about?  I don't know.  I can't think of anything.
Speaker 1: Well, if you think of it we can still talk about it.  But because this information, sharing your story, is going to be a part of history where students--well, anyone--but a lot of students will be looking at this video in the years and years to come.  If you had to send a message to the future generations, what would you say?
Speaker 2: I think, don't let other people limit you.  It's probably very improbable that I received, or was able to get to the position that I'm in today--being general counsel of a Fortune 500 company [United Parcel Service], the second largest employer in the country--private employer in the country.  If I had planned to be here, it probably would not have happened.  But by virtue of being committed to my goals, and working hard, and maintaining good relationships, opportunities presented themselves that I was able to take advantage of, which allowed me to be in the position that I am today.  So, you can never burn bridges.  You should always leave with a positive frame of mind, a positive relationship with the people that you're leaving.  Even if you don't care what you're doing or care for the people you're working with, you don't have to let them know it, because you just never know who might, who you run across that might influence your career in the future.  Every job that I've had since I graduated from college [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri], from law school [Emory University School of Law, Atlanta, Georgia], was as a result of someone reaching out to me, and not me looking for the job.  And it was always as a result of relationships that I had developed at some point and time.  And so, you just, you know, you can't let your grades or anything dictate where you end up.  But maintaining positive relationships, and having people think highly of you, and letting your reputation speak for you is very, very valuable.
Story_ID: 608516
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: My legacy, I think, is twofold.  I guess the part that you haven't asked about is really my other life, which is as a pastor's wife, and very involved in mission work and in the community.  I'm a faith woman, I'm a woman of faith.  My faith is the reason why I am here today.  I have no doubt about that, that I couldn't haven't orchestrated this, that it could only be the hand of God.  So, my faith is, you know, everything.  And I don't take credit for anything other than what God has allowed me to do.  So, my faith is a large part of who I am, and I share my faith a lot.  And I tell people that, you know, it is because of my faith that I was able to, you know, get through some of the challenging times in my career and overcome some of the, you know, problems that I experienced.  It wasn't always, you know, luck, and you know, everything didn't work out to the best of it every time.  There were several periods of time where there were challenges that I thought I would not overcome.  But it was a result of my faith that I was able to overcome.  So, my husband [Roderick McClure] and I are very committed to working in the church.  I personally have a passion for mission work in Africa and abroad.  And so that's something that, my goal in the future is to do more of that.  My husband and I established a church in Africa, in Zambia.  We've been there once, and we hope to be going back again.  And so that's, that's something that is very near and dear to me that I hope ultimately will be my legacy, that it would be in that area more so than in business.  From a business standpoint, I spend a lot of time now mentoring young women and young men, but mostly young women, who are in the legal profession, primarily African American women, but not solely African American women.  And I tell people all the time, you know, you never--it can never hurt to ask someone for advice or guidance.  And I'm always willing to help anyone who will ask.  And it's interesting to see those who ask and those who don't.  But I like to talk with young women who are developing their careers and talking about, you know, balancing work and family, and you know, relationships and relocation issues, and talk through how I made those decisions, and give them a perspective.  I can't answer the questions for them, but I hope that my legacy is to show them that there is a way to manage it, and to set boundaries for yourself, and to live according to your boundaries and according to your faith, and to be successful and not let others dictate your course in life.  So I think, I hope that will be my legacy as well, and then my girls [Kristin McClure and Morgan McClure] and the families that they develop, and the people that they grow up to be.
Speaker 1: As a first lady at your church, have you developed women's programs that you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --also work with?
Speaker 2: Sure, we do a lot of programs.  I head up the women's ministry at various points in time, and enjoy doing that.  I enjoy teaching.  That's probably my other passion, is teaching, whether its labor and employment or, you know, my biblical studies.  I enjoy that.  And so, my husband and I do also a lot of marriage conferences.  We do, we like sharing with other couples strategies for successful marriages, and so we do quite a bit of teaching along that line.  But, yeah.
Story_ID: 608517
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you have not done that you would like to do?
Speaker 2: I love to travel.  I'm sort of a, I'm an adrenaline junkie, so I'll try anything once.  I want to go whitewater rafting down the Colorado River.  I want to jump out of a plane.  I want to do 'The Amazing Race,' which I can convince my husband [Roderick McClure] to do.  I love that show, and I would do it in a heartbeat.  (Laughter) I love to travel to different places and, you know, would love to get back to Africa and to spend a significant period of time in Africa.  So, that's, that's most of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Have you thought about anything else you would like to--
Speaker 2: Other than my husband.  You know, I think he is a phenomenal man who has made many sacrifices in support of my career, who is very supportive.  But I think he has his own path that he has paved for himself, and he's been very successful in his own career.  He developed a very successful business which was challenging in and of itself.  And I was an attorney practicing law, and he was building his own business, and we had two small kids [Kristin McClure and Morgan McClure] and we managed to work through all the challenges that that brought.  And he ultimately gave up his business to go into the ministry full-time.  And it was a hard decision, but an easy decision in some respects, because it was something that allowed him to do what he felt was his passion.  And both his mother and my mother [Donna Mitchell Plummer] were very helpful when our children were young, in helping us balance all the things that we were trying to do.  And certainly we could not have done it without either of them.
