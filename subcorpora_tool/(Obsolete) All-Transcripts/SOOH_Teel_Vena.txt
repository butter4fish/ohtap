 L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  R. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  Today is March 1, 2011. My name is Latasha Wilson and I   m with the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at the Oklahoma State  University Library. I am in Dill City, Oklahoma, today, at the home of  Vena and Travis Teel. I will be interviewing Vena today as part of the  Spotlighting Oklahoma Oral History Series.  Randy Wilson is also  joining us.  Thank you for having me in your home.  You   re welcome.  Let   s start out by having you tell me where you were born.  I was born in this town right here where I live, Dill City, on September  14, 1931. The house I was born in is no longer there, but we moved then.  What county is this?  Washita County. Do you want me to tell you where we moved to?  Sure.  We moved before I remember anything about Dill City to Cloud Chief,  Oklahoma, which is about eight miles east and a little over a mile south  of Cordell, and we lived on a farm over there.  How old were you when you moved?  I   m not sure. I guess just a baby, because I don   t remember.  Do you know anything about the house you were born in?  It was just a little, small house they said, here in Dill City.  5  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  How many siblings do you have?  Well, at that time, I had two living and two that were deceased. Then we  moved to Cloud Chief and that   s where we lived when I started school.  Then after we moved back over here, I had another sibling. So, they  ended up with four girls.  What did your parents do for a living?  We farmed.  What kind of crops?  Cotton and wheat, milo, and then we always had livestock. Daddy  farmed with horses, and I never did help farm with horses. He traded and  got a tractor, and that   s the first memory I have with helping farm was  on a tractor, but I remember the horses and we always had cattle and  chickens and hogs and turkeys.  How did you help him farm?  Oh, well, you got to drive the tractor. You got to chop cotton. You got to  pull cotton. You got to head maze and shock feed. There were no boys  in our family so, the girls did the work just like the boys did.  For people that aren   t familiar with farming, what does some of that  entail, chopping cotton and what not?  Well, they plant cotton and then, of course, back then, we had nothing to  get rid of the weeds with except a hoe and so, you went down through  there with a hoe and hoed the weeds out of this cotton. Then, whenever  they pulled cotton when it got ready to harvest, you had this long cotton  sack that you had to strap over your shoulder, and you just stooped over  and pulled cotton and put it in that sack.  How many acres of cotton was this that you would work?  Well, Daddy generally just farmed eighty acres, at that time, and then  got to where he farmed more, but when we were pulling by hand we had  about 160 acres of farmland. It wasn   t all cotton. I   d say we probably  had, maybe, thirty acres of cotton.  And what months are you   ?  Well, you grow cotton, generally, in May, June, July and then you  started pulling, generally, in September.  6  L. Wilson  Teel  R. Wilson  Teel  R. Wilson  Teel  R. Wilson  Teel  R. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  R. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Did he have any hired hands or other help?  Oh, no. No hired hands. (Laughs)  What was that first tractor?  A Farmall. The first tractor he had when he bought it. It was during the  war, and it had lugs. There were no rubber tires, but then I remember  when he put tires on it.  Did that tractor have one little tire in the front or do you remember what  kind of front it had?  It had two little tires.  Two little ones?  Yes.  Steel wheels, I guess?  Yes, when he first got it.  Going back to your parents, do you know how they met?  Not really.  Were they both from the area?  Daddy was from down around Sentinel, and Mother was from here in  Dill City.  Do you know how their families originally came to this area?  My grandparents on Mother   s side came down from Iowa and bought  this farm and farmed over here. My daddy   s grandfather, he made the  run in Oklahoma and they lived in a half dugout over south of Cordell.  Was that Mr. Werhan?  Yes. So, just think, if you were living in a dugout, you wouldn   t have to  worry about sweeping the floor, would you? (Laughter)  Yes. (Laughs) And his family had come from Germany?  7  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  R. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  They had come from Germany, yes.  So, did you get to spend much time with your grandparents growing up?  We lived close to my mother   s side of the family, just half a mile, but  my other grandparents had moved to California when I was small so, I  didn   t get to visit with them much until I got up in high school. Then we  began to visit more back and forth   junior high and high school. They  would ride the train and come back here. Then, in the late forties we  went to California for the first time.  Did they move to California because of the hard times in Oklahoma?  That   s exactly right.  Did you hear stories about their journey?  Yes, I talked to   well, not them particularly, but I talked to one of my  cousins that went out there, and he said they rode in a Model T car,  which had just the one seat, and then it had a rumble seat on the back.  There were six people that rode in that little old car and went to  California. They went in July, and they drove twenty-five miles an hour   The man that owned the car wouldn   t let them drive any faster than  twenty-five miles an hour. I can   t imagine going to California at twenty-five  miles an hour.  No   In the summertime, with no air conditioning.  And then they had personal belongings on there somewhere.  Well, they built little boxes they sat on the running board of that car and  they put their cookware and stuff. They   d pack that stuff in there that  they needed.  Would they write you all letters?  Yes, yes, we   d get letters from them.  Did you hear about how life was in California once they got there? Was  it what they   d expected?  Well, they had to work hard when they got out there, too. They picked  peaches and they pulled cotton. The cotton out there, they   d talk about  how big the cotton was out there because they irrigated out there. The  8  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  cotton was a lot taller than it was here. But my grandparents pulled  cotton. My grandpa was a carpenter. He built houses and a lot of the  men worked at that after they got out there, but when they first went they  picked peaches and they pulled cotton. They pulled cotton on the Tagus  Ranch, and there is a book. It may be the book The Grapes of Wrath that  talks about the people going to California.  Yes.  It may be in that book that they talk about the Tagus Ranch, but I know  there is a book because I   ve read one somewhere that had a story about  the Tagus Ranch, and that   s the ranch they pulled cotton on.  What town was that near in California?  Oh, Tulare. That   s where they lived, was at Tulare. All of them lived  around there.  So, what did you think about The Grapes of Wrath?  Oh, it was an interesting book to know all the things that people went  through. They didn   t have it easy. That   s definite.  Well, how were things in Oklahoma during that time for the people that  stayed? Did you experience dust?  We had lots of dust, and we had lots of wind. Of course, our house,  when we moved back to Dill   well, at Cloud Chief we lived in a four-room  house, but one room was just used for storage so, we just used  three rooms. When we moved back to Dill, we moved into a four-room  house. We had no running water, only run outside and get it. (Laughter)  To think about washing clothes, how we had to do that   if you didn   t  have enough clothesline to hang all your clothes on, you had a pasture  fence that would be pretty close. You   d hang your old clothes that you  didn   t have to be careful with, you   d hang them on that barbwire fence.  Tell me about doing laundry.  Well, I never did have to rub on the rub board. I tried it a time or two,  and I   m not very good at it. (Laughs) They would heat water and fix this  tub and have a rub board and rub those clothes. I can   t imagine rubbing  bed sheets on there   Where would the water come from?  We had a well that you   d go out and pump water.  9  L. Wilson  Teel  R. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  R. Wilson  And you used that for your drinking water?  And we used that for our drinking water. In the wintertime, it was cold  in the house because you didn   t have a fire at night. So, when the fire  went out that you had built during the day, then it was just cold in that  house. When you   d get up the next morning and go to the water bucket  to get a drink, the dipper would be frozen in the water bucket.  Wow.  So, you   d have to build a fire and set the bucket on the stove to thaw it  so you could get a drink.  How would you stay warm at night?  Lots of cover.  Quilts that your mother made?  Well, yes, blankets and just lots of cover. So much cover, sometimes  you felt like you couldn   t turn over. Before you would go to bed in the  wintertime, you would take a brick and put it on the heater and get it  warm. You   d wrap it in an old piece of a blanket or something, and put  that at the foot of the bed to get your feet warm when you went to bed.  What about bath time? How did you bathe?  We had a number two wash tub, and we would carry   we   d heat the  water and then we   d start out with the youngest and bathe. We generally  just bathed on Saturday nights. We   d start out with the youngest and  work our way up. So, when you got to poor Daddy, he was the last.  (Laughs)  Did your family have a big garden?  Yes, we always had a big garden, always, big garden  We raised corn  and potatoes and tomatoes and okra, beans. I know the night before my  youngest sister was born, we had picked a tub full of green beans and  then my mother went to the hospital. Grandma and we girls got to can  beans all day that day. A tub full of beans sounds like a lot of beans.  Yes. (Laughs)  About that bath water, everybody got to use the same tub of bath water?  10  Teel  R. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  R. Wilson  Teel  Yes, everybody got to use the same tub of bath water.  Just add a little hot water as you went along?  That   s right. If you   d been out working, you might sit down on the back  step and wash your feet off before you went to bed, but as far as getting  in the tub, you didn   t. My mother was always afraid that we were going  to take a bath, if we had a cold, then it would make it worse. So, you  didn   t even wash your hair once a week if you had a bad cold.  Did you use lye soap?  Yes, we did, and Mother made her soap. We killed our own meat at  home. We killed hogs and a lot of times, maybe two or three neighbors  would bring their hogs and you   d kill hogs for maybe two or three  families at the same time, because you   d have this vat that you scalded  them in to where you could scrape the hair off of them.  And then smoke them in a smokehouse?  Oh, no, you didn   t smoke them. You just put your meat out there. Now,  my daddy got to where he sugar cured a lot of the pork, rubbed that on  there.  And then you raised chickens?  We had chickens. We had chickens and then we   d always have a bunch  of chickens as fryers so we could have fresh fryers, and then we had  eggs. We had our own milk and we had our own cream. That   s what  Mother and Daddy used to buy groceries with was the milk and cream  and eggs. When you   d milk your cows, you had this separator that you   d  put your milk in there and turn that separator, and when you   d get it up  going just about right then and you wanted to keep it that way, you   d  separate the cream from the milk. You fed the milk that you got to the  hogs and the cream, you put in the cream can. Then you took it to town  on Saturday. You would take what eggs you had, and that   s what you  used to buy flour and sugar and things that you didn   t have at home. But  we didn   t buy Crisco. We had lard at home because we when killed  these hogs, you took that fat and you put it in a pot and built a big fire  under it. You rendered it out, and then we had our own lard.  As far as chickens go, I guess you had fresh chicken whenever you  wanted chicken.  No freezer.  11  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Who was in charge of killing those?  Mother or Daddy. (Laughter) I never did kill a chicken except one time,  and that was by an accident. I threw a board at it  (Laughter)  Did you eat it then?  We tried. It was pretty tough. It was an old rooster. (Laughter)  Would they wring the chicken   s necks?  Yes, that   s the way Mother always did it. She   d get a hold of their heads,  but I don   t think I could ever ring a chicken   s neck.  Did you eat beef?  Yes.  How often would you slaughter a cow?  Oh, probably once a year.  And how would you preserve that meat?  You had it hanging outside where it was all right during the cold  weather. But when it began to get warm weather and you were going to  have to do something, Mother would cut it up and fry it and pressure  cook it in jars and put it in the cellar.  Did you ever get ice?  Ever buy ice? Oh, yes. Sometimes we   d buy ice. When we lived at  Cloud Chief, the first thing I remember of us having anything that would  keep anything cool, Daddy (and I don   t know where he got this, whether  somebody built it, because he didn   t weld) but it was a frame and it was  smaller at the top and the legs slanted. It had shelves in it and it had a  pan, a big pan that would sit under it. You had to wrap a block of ice and  put on top of that and this deal was wrapped around with ducking or  canvas   whatever word you want to use for it. You wrap it around and  then you could set your butter and stuff in there and it would keep it  cool. Set it by a window and keep that cloth fit down in that pan at the  bottom where the water was, and it would absorb that. Then the wind  blowing in would make it cool. But ice was rare. I mean, we didn   t get  ice all the time.  Did you get to make ice cream sometimes when you had ice?  12  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  R. Wilson  Teel  I don   t ever remember my parents making ice cream when I was a kid,  other than snow ice cream. If it come a big snow, they might go out and  dip up some of the snow and fix it and make some snow ice cream, but  as far as making a freezer and making ice cream at home, I don   t.  Would you have a favorite meal on your birthday or on special  occasions?  I don   t ever remember having anything big. They might make you a  little chocolate cake or something. It   d just be some little thing, but we  didn   t do any big celebrations.  What were some of your favorite meals your mom would make?  Mother was good at frying chicken. Mother was a good cook. She could  make a lot of things. We   d have fried potatoes a lot of times for  breakfast, and we   ve even had fried chicken for breakfast. When the  chickens were just right to be killed, yes, we had fried chicken for  breakfast. That   s good, too.  Do you use her recipes or make things the way she would now?  Not too many. I have some things, but not a whole lot. But you learned  how to make salmon patties at home, and you learned   there are just a  lot of things that you learned how to do, but as far as her having recipes  written down, I don   t remember her having a lot of recipes written  down. She just cooked.  You mentioned going to town on Saturdays. Would you do that  regularly?  Us girls didn   t always get to go to town with them, but sometimes we   d  go. You always had to go to town on Saturdays to take off your cream  because after it had set in that can a week in a house with no air  conditioning, it was time for it to go to town. (Laughs)  What town did you go to?  Well, they took it to Cordell for a long time, and then they got a cream  mill over here at Dill. I remember we brought some over here, but I  remember us taking it to Cordell a lot. At that time, there were three of  us girls and at that time, a Three Musketeer candy bar came with three  little bars   that   s how it was made up, just three little individual bars  wrapped in this one paper. They were about this long and about that  wide, and if Mother had money left, we could have a candy bar for all  13  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  R. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  three of us. So, each one of us got a piece of candy about that long and  about that wide  motions .  And that was a big treat.  And that was a big treat. Now people have candy all over their house all  the time.  Did you ever get to go to the show?  Oh, I didn   t go to a picture show until   oh, I don   t know. I was probably  fifteen. It would   ve been when my grandparents came back here from  California and Grandpa Werhan really loved to go to the show. He was  used to going to the show out there, to Roy Rogers show. So, when they  would come we would go to the show on Saturday nights sometimes, but  I probably didn   t go to a show until I was fifteen or sixteen.  And that was in Dill City that you   d go?  Yes, yes.  Were there any town celebrations, like at Fourth of July or any time that  the town would get together?  Well, they would have Fourth of July celebrations sometimes, and they  always celebrated. The thing that I remember is they celebrated the Run  of Oklahoma. It was sometimes at Cordell and sometimes it was at  Clinton, different towns, and we always went to that. When they   d have  that, Daddy liked to go because he   d see a lot of people he knew.  What month?  In April.  What would you all do for Christmas?  Well, you went out to the pasture and cut down a little Christmas tree   a  little cedar tree. I remember one year Mother saying she didn   t know  how in the world she was going to buy us girls anything for Christmas.  That   s when there were just three of us and we lived at Cloud Chief.  They would have drawings on Saturday afternoon at the courthouse, and  she drew five dollars. She went into the TG Y and bought us a little  doll. We didn   t have lots and lots of Christmas stuff like they do  nowadays.  Would you get together with any other family members?  14  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  We probably were with Grandma Berrie some at Christmas time, but  that would be about the size of it.  Do you remember feeling the effects of the Depression?  Not really, because I was born in    31. That was kind of right in the  Depression time. I was so small I guess it didn   t really matter. I know  we didn   t have anything when I was in grade school, but most of the  people that I was in school with didn   t have anything either. So, we were  all kind of in the same boat.  How old were you when you started school?  Five.  And where was that?  At Cloud Chief. I went one semester at Cloud Chief and then we moved  to Dill and I finished here.  Did you graduate high school in Dill?  Yes, and all three of our kids graduated from Dill.  What did you do after you graduated?  I was going to help my daddy farm. That   s what I was doing. I was  helping him farm, and then when Travis and I got married, I had a crop  started with Daddy so, I had to finish out that crop, helping him farm  that first year we were married. Then we had a farm that Travis was  working, too.  How did you meet Travis?  At church.  And what year did you get married?     51. So, this May we will have been married sixty years.  Wow  Congratulations.  Thank you  (Laughter)  Do you have any secrets to a long, happy marriage?  15  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  R. Wilson  Teel  R. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  R. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  Just do what you   re supposed to do. (Laughs) Do what you promised to  do. Isn   t that right? Yes.  How many children do you all have?  We have three.  Well, can you think of any more stories from your times growing up that  you   d like to share?  I   d like to tell you about our first trip to California, because most people  can   t believe that we did that. We went in July.  What year, approximately?  I   m thinking probably    46 is when I think we went. We went in July, and  there were six of us   four kids and Mother and Daddy. We pulled a  little trailer. Daddy fixed a little two-wheel trailer and he put a bed in it.  He fixed a mattress and just regular old metal springs and put a mattress  in it. He fixed it to where at night, he could put a deal up and cover it.  A tent?  A tent, kind of. And he put it up high. He put this mattress and springs  up high enough that he could slide boxes underneath it with fruit jars in  them. So, he filled all of that space with boxes with fruit jars. We didn   t  sleep in a motel. We didn   t eat a meal in a restaurant. Now, this was  July. We did not have an air conditioned car. We stopped by the side of  the road and Mother and Edith and my youngest sister, Bertha, would  sleep in this trailer with this cover over it. Daddy would sleep on the cot  outside the road. I would sleep in the front seat of the car and Stella  would sleep in the backseat. You wouldn   t dare stop out by the side of  the road and sleep like that now.  How many days did it take you to get to California?  Three days.  Was that on Highway 66?  On Highway 66.  And what did you do once you got there?  Well, we went to see Grandpa and Grandma. We did a lot of things that  16  R. Wilson  Teel  R. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  year while we were out there. The purpose of taking these fruit jars was  we canned peaches while we were out there and brought them back. So,  that   s what the purpose of taking all these fruit jars was. We   d never  been so, they took us lots of places. We went to the ocean. We went to  Sequoyah National Park. Daddy went deep sea fishing, but he didn   t  much want us girls to go because he was afraid we might get sick. Of  course, Mother wasn   t going. She wasn   t about to go. Edith and Bertha  weren   t going, but Stella and I wanted to go. He had a cousin that lived  down south of Tulare and when we went by down that way, they owned  a boat that they   d go out and stay quite a while. They could sleep in it  and everything. So, he took us out to go fishing and we got to do that.  Then, we went on down to a place that was called Cardiff-by-the-Sea  and Grandpa Werhan   s sister lived there. It was just right close to the  ocean. It was down close to San Diego. We got to go down there and  there was a whale that had died and washed up on the beach so, we  could see it.  I remember when we were getting ready to go because Daddy said we  had never been   he   d been out there one time on the bus with his sister  to see his parents, but he said taking his family he wanted us to see a lot  of things and so, we just did a lot of things. When he said he was going  to go down to Cardiff-by-the-Sea, Grandpa Werhan said,    Well, I   m not  going  Willis is not used to this traffic and I'm not going.    Grandma  Werhan said,    Well, that   s all right. If you want to stay here then you  just stay, because I am going     (Laughter) Of course, he gave up and  went too, but that made eight of us in that car. (Laughs)  What car was that?  It was probably a    38. It might have been older than that. It might have  been a    42, I don   t remember. But it was a Chevrolet that just had two  seats in it. It wasn   t anything fancy.  Did those fruit jars have food in them that you   d eat on the way out  there?  No. Well, we took some food. Some of that beef that we talked about  Mother canning. That   s what they took, and they   d get out and build a  little fire and warm that up. Man, the last morning out I had about all of  that that I thought I could eat for breakfast  (Laughter)  When your grandparents moved out to California, did they already have  family out there?  Three of their kids had moved out there and so, they moved out there. I  imagine that some of Grandpa Werhan   s family lived out there, but they  17  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  R. Wilson  Teel  R. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  lived farther south. One of his brothers lived at Pasadena, and then his  sister lived down at Cardiff-by-the-Sea, but Grandma didn   t have any  family out there.  Do you remember hearing anything about the term    Okies?     Oh, yes  (Laughs) Everybody was called Okies when they went to  California. They   re just an Okie. But now, California people are coming  back to Oklahoma so, what are we going to call them now? (Laughter)  Back to growing up days, what would you do for entertainment?  We made our own entertainment. We   ve laughed about this, and what  got us to doing this when we lived at Cloud Chief, I have no idea, but we  had an old organ. A lot of times they   d take somebody home with them  for Sunday. Back then, you nearly always either went somewhere on  Sunday or you took somebody home with you for Sunday.  After church?  Yes, after church. These people came to our house and we had this old  organ (and why we did this, I don   t know). We had a big old cardboard  box and we had a net that they would use. They called it a mosquito bar  net and it was to put over the babies when they slept, to keep the flies  and stuff off of them. We   d play funeral and somebody would get in that  box and they   d be the dead person, somebody else would play the organ,  and the others would cry. Why we did that, I don   t know  (Laughter)  Back then, when you went to a funeral, when they opened the casket to  view the body, it was always covered with a net.  They used to keep it at people   s houses, too.  Yes, they did, but they always covered that with a net to keep the flies  and things off the people, because there were lots of flies back then. If  we got a fly in the house now, you get the fly swatter and go after it, but  the flies were everywhere back then.  Did you go to lots of funerals?  Mother and Daddy went if it was any of their friends. They went to the  funeral.  Did you go to many weddings, do you remember?  Oh, no. I don   t remember going to a wedding until I was     18  T. Teel  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  R. Wilson  Teel  R. Wilson  Teel  R. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  Until you had your own? (Laughter)  Nearly grown. I was nearly grown before I went to a wedding. They  didn   t have church weddings, and we didn   t have a church wedding. We  got married over here where I grew up.  Did you all have a radio in your house?  No, we didn   t have electricity.  When did you get electricity?  Well, it was in the forties. I don   t know exactly what year it was, but we  didn   t have it. We had a telephone when we lived at Cloud Chief, but  when we moved to Dill we didn   t have a telephone and we didn   t have a  radio. If the president was going to speak, I remember our neighbor lady  had a radio, and if Daddy heard the president was going to speak, we   d  go down to her house when he was going to speak and listen to it.  Who would the president be, you think?  When I was thinking about it, it was probably Roosevelt, I would think  is who he was listening to. But we made up our own games. We   d get  out and we   d build a playhouse out in the trees and take twine and tie it  from one tree to another to make a room. We made up our own stuff. It   s  not like kids do nowadays. I don   t ever remember saying I was bored. I  never remember saying I was bored.  Geneva  Berrie Evans  would do cartwheels at the cotton patch.  Yes, Geneva would do cartwheels when we got through pulling cotton   (Laughs) When Daddy planted cotton he would put some watermelon  seed in there along with the cotton seed. We   d be pulling cotton and  your great-grandmother, she came to a watermelon and she loved that  better than nearly anybody I ever saw. She   d come to a watermelon and  she   d bust that thing open, pull her glove off and dig in that watermelon,  get the heart out of it, and eat it.  Was that Leatha  Berrie ?  Yes.  Seeds and all?  Well, put it in her mouth and spit the seeds out, yes. Her hands would be  dirty, but she didn   t care. Then they   d be sticky after that so, she   d rub  19  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  R. Wilson  Teel  R. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  them on her cotton side or on her clothes or whatever. She loved it. She  loved watermelon.  So, were you around your cousins much?  Oh, not just bunches, but yes. We   d all be up at Grandma Berrie   s  sometimes, and stuff like that. Aunt Leatha and Geneva helped us pull  cotton sometimes. They   d come down and pull cotton. We just had a lot  of fun, did a lot of things.  Did you hear about any WPA  Works Progress Administration  projects  in the area?  I know some of the things that happened with the WPA projects, but I  don   t remember them talking about it back then. WPA built some  outhouses. In fact, when we lived in Ninnekah, that outhouse was built  by WPA.  Would they just haul them in?  No, they   d go out and they   d pour concrete. That   s the first one that  we   d ever had that had a concrete seat in it, because that   s not the way  we grew up.  Built to last.  When we were growing up, you didn   t have to buy toilet tissue because  you used catalogs. You didn   t have to buy paper towels. You wouldn   t  have spent money on paper towels. How do you live in a house now  without paper towels? See, we   re spoiled.  Yes.  We are a spoiled people now.  Well, what are some lessons that you   ve learned growing up that you   ve  carried through your life?  Just work hard and always be honest. Do unto others as you would want  to them to do to you. My daddy would help anybody any time. It didn   t  make any difference. So, that   s just the way we   ve tried to live.  When you talk about those times, they were hard times. Some people say  they were the good ol    days. What are some of the differences between  then and now that are positive?  20  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  R. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  People visited with their neighbors a lot more then than they do now.  They had time to help neighbors more than they do now. Everybody is  so busy, so involved, so sports-minded, and that wasn   t the way when  we were growing up. About the only activities we had was if you visited  with your family or if you went to church. I mean, we didn   t have a lot  of other activities. We didn   t go to the ball games at night. Now, we   ve  got some grandkids that are so sports minded that they   re busy all the  time. I just think people had more concern, really, back then for people  than a lot of people do nowadays.  Sports are not bad.   And people have compared our recent economic crisis to the 1930s. Do  you think there is any comparison there?  Not to me, there isn   t. It may get to where it is.  Not even close.  Not even close, no. But the thing about it is, now, if we get into times  that people can   t afford to do things, our younger generation does not  know how to cope with that. They have not a clue. Travis and I could  survive without a lot of things that we   re used to doing, but a younger  generation would sure have a hard time learning how to cope. They   re  used to so many things. We didn   t jump in the car and run to town if you  needed some little something. And it may get to where we don   t do that  now, if gas keeps going up and our income doesn   t increase. Right now,  they say we don   t have a cost of living increase in the last two years,  people that draw social security checks haven   t had an increase now for  two years, but if you go to the grocery store or if you go to the gas  pumps, anywhere you go, it seems to me like everything   s up. I don   t  know what that is if it   s not cost of living, but we can get by. We don   t  have to have as many things as a lot of people think they have to have.  Speaking of that, what are some things you would use to cure ailments?  When we were sick?  Yes.  Oh, well if you took a bad cold, you got a dose of castor oil, because that  sure cleansed your body out. (Laughter) If you stepped on a nail, you  soaked your foot in kerosene. If you had the croup, you would get hot  lard sometimes. That sounds nasty, doesn   t it? Or, you might get a drop  of turpentine on some sugar, if you had the croup. Of course, we had  doctors. I remember when we lived at Cloud Chief, I had pneumonia and  a doctor from Cordell came out there to see me. What they gave me, I  don   t remember, because that was before the days of antibiotics so, I  21  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  Teel  L. Wilson  V. Teel  don   t know what they gave me, but you rubbed Vicks on. You   d rub  Vicks on your chest and wrap a hot rag around your throat if you had a  sore throat.  What about a bee sting?  Oh, you just hoped it quit hurting because I don   t remember anything  that they did for it. (Laughs)  Do you remember having home demonstration agents come around?  No, no. I remember having Rawleigh and Watkins salesmen come  around with their little deal and oh, it was so neat because they had all  kinds of stuff in there  They would have flavorings and spices and stuff.  I remember them coming around doing that.  Were there ever any hobos that passed by? Are there train tracks near  here?  Well, there are train tracks over here. Of course, we lived two miles  farther west so, I don   t remember seeing any hobos. The only time I ever  remember of my mother and daddy being afraid was when we lived (and  I don   t know that Daddy was afraid, but Mother was) we lived at Cloud  Chief. There were some people that came and they wanted to know if we  had some kerosene and some old rags. Mother was afraid that they were  going to try and set the house on fire. They were some people that  weren   t really what you would call the kind of people you would want  around. I remember that, but I don   t remember ever anybody else  coming.  When the bus used to run and stop at that station, up there by Grandma  Berrie   s house and the service in World War II, and those service boys  would get off of the bus and they   d be going to Sentinel. Daddy got up  lots of times when they   d knock at our door and he would take them to  Sentinel when they   d come home. Now, if somebody comes to your  door and asks you to take them somewhere, unless you know them,  you   re nearly afraid to do that kind of stuff. We have so much meanness.  I   ve never heard of anybody taking a gun to school when I was going to  school.  How did things change during World War II around here?  Well, of course, we had lots of things that were rationed   shoes, you  had to have a stamp to buy new shoes. You had to have a stamp to buy  sugar. You had to have stamps to buy tires. You had to have stamps to  buy gas. You didn   t just go to the store and buy a pair of shoes if you  22  R. Wilson  V. Teel  L. Wilson  V. Teel  L. Wilson  V. Teel  L. Wilson  V. Teel  wanted to buy a pair of shoes, because if you didn   t have a stamp, you  couldn   t buy shoes.  It was rubber related?  Yes, and for the sugar and that kind of stuff you had to have stamps.  They mailed out these stamps and you had to have that before you could   purchase those things . And if your tires got bad, you just had worn out  tires. People did get to where tires would be so bad that they had trouble  keeping tires good enough to go places. But as I say, we didn   t jump in  the car and go places like we do nowadays.  Did you have any family members that were in the war or people close  to you?  Not immediate. My daddy was in World War I. And your great-grandfather,   Robert Henry Berrie,  was in World War I. But in World  War II, I had some cousins that were in the war. Travis was in World  War II, but he didn   t have to go overseas.  Did you hear any stories from your dad about World War I?  Not much. He wasn   t in there very long and he was sick. I think he had  the flu a lot of that time he was in there. The flu was bad, and he wasn   t  in there very long before the armistice was signed. And Mother said that  was really something, when the armistice was signed. Everybody went  to town and was happy.  What does Oklahoma mean to you?  Well, Oklahoma is a wonderful place to live, because that   s the only  state I   ve ever lived in. They talk about the wind blowing in Oklahoma  and we   ve traveled a lot of different places, just vacationing and going  different places. Every place we go, it seems like the wind blows.  (Laughter) So, it   s not just the Oklahoma wind. Maybe it   s a little  stronger in Oklahoma. (Laughter) If I was going to live somewhere  besides Oklahoma, I   ve always thought I   d like to live in the mountains  because I love the smell in the mountains, but I probably wouldn   t like  getting up and down out of the mountains so well. I would not want to  live in the big cities. I know that the age that we are getting, we hope we  are fortunate enough to live our lives out right here, but we don   t know.  None of our kids live here. So, if we get to the point where we can   t take  care of ourselves, we might have to do something, but I don   t have any  idea of where I would want to go. Two of them live in Oklahoma. One  of them lives in Stillwater. I guess I   d just go up to OSU. (Laughter)  23  R. Wilson  L. Wilson  V. Teel  L. Wilson  V. Teel  L. Wilson  V. Teel  L. Wilson  V. Teel  That   s a good answer. (Laughter)  What was your profession?  I guess you would say I was a homemaker and a housewife. We finally  got so poor that I needed to go to work. We lived at Ninnekah for a  while and I worked at a compress in the office, a cotton compress, until  Gary was born. Then I stayed at home and we moved back up here. I  didn   t work until the time after all of our kids were in school. Then I  worked down here at the cotton gin. I worked there twenty-five years in  the office. I worked selling cotton, and then I worked as a bookkeeper.  Is the cotton gin still going?  Yes, it is. I retired in 1999.  Well, one question that we like to ask everyone is when history is written  about you, what would you like for it to say?  That I knew how to work, that we tried to live a Christian life, and we  were happy.  Excellent, that   s wonderful. Well, thank you very much.  You   re welcome.  -------  -------
