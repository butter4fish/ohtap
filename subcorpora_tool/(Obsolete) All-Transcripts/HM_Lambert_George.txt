Story_ID: 648514
Speaker 1: All right.  Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask that only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I love sweet potatoes and I also enjoy salmon as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I love blue.
Speaker 1: All right.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I, I enjoy the, the Christmas holiday season.
Speaker 1: Okay, favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I would love to go back to Greece.
Speaker 1: And the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I have a couple of them.  So one is, have mercy. The other one is, you know, to God be the glory.  So, but yeah.
Story_ID: 648515
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well, I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay (clears throat).
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [George H. Lambert, Sr.] side; but we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name was Arnitha, so that's spelled, A-R-N-I-T-H-A, middle name, Anna, A-N-N-A, and then last name, Green, G-R-E-E-N [Arnitha Green Allen].
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth was November 28th, 1915, and Annapolis, Maryland.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  What can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: You know, unfortunately, there's not a whole lot of history that I have with both my parents in terms of their side of the family.  My mother lost both of her parents when she was a teenager and so, therefore, in terms of recordkeeping, we had very little of that.  And then my mother was also delivered by then what was considered a midwife, as well, and so, you know, oftentimes I understand that midwives did not keep records, did not record those records.  So even the date of her birthday, I remember as a child growing up, various times when my mother was just trying to get certain information about herself, some of it she could get, some of it she couldn't get because it was just, you know, she was pretty much guessing on the date by information that had been passed down to her.  So, but, again, Annapolis, Maryland, she was one of, of two brothers and, yeah, so one of three children.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was there, what are the, what were the occupations of some of your relatives?  What did your mother's parents do?
Speaker 2: So, none of her, neither one of her parents were really educated.  I think her father [Frank Green] was really in the fishing industry business and her mother [Anna Green] was pretty much a homecare provider.  Even with my mother, although she was a minister, both my parents were ministers, for many years mom had just, you know, gone, up--finished through high school, then her and my father, they met at the Washington Baptist Seminary [Washington Baptist Theological Seminary, Washington, D.C.].  And so, when she went into seminary, is when she, and she actually finished at Howard University's [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] seminary there.  So when she furthered her education but, but for many years, her education only went up to high school.  So she was an adult many years into her, you know, her adulthood before she actually went back to school.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So did she aspire to become a minister when she was--
Speaker 2: She aspired to become a minister but kind of her, her stock in trade in terms of her real work was in the nursing field.  So, she did become a nurse and provided nursing care for families, particularly affluent families.  So she did, I don't know, I guess you refer to it as, providing, I guess, well support for affluent, you know, affluent families in terms of nursing.  At one point in her lifetime, she also had a nursing home.  So it was in her home in York, Pennsylvania and she provided, I guess probably about maybe, oh, ten to fifteen or so persons that she had, she provided care for in the home.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did she have any stories about growing up that she shared with you?
Speaker 2: She did.  You know, her growing up was very different than mine.  Of course as I said, she had lost both her parents when she was a teenager.  She was actually raised by an aunt.  I remember her sharing that with me and the aunt that raised her, very interesting, I remember as a very young child, that aunt at some point developed diabetes and so she brought the aunt to live with us.  I was probably no more than about three or four years old but I kind of remember the aunt.  The aunt had, both of her legs were amputated and so my mother really provided care for that aunt but, you know, I, my sense then certainly would imagine that, you know, her growing up, her upbringing was very different than mine, you know; so it was, she was challenged, she was very challenged.
Story_ID: 648516
Speaker 1: Let me go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name?
Speaker 2: George Henry Lambert, Sr. [George H. Lambert, Sr.], so I'm, of course, I'm a junior.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we can assume it's spelled the same way as--
Speaker 2: Assume the same, it's the same way, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, what is his date of birth?
Speaker 2: My father was born June 29th, 1917.  So he was actually two years younger than my mother [Arnitha Green Allen].
Speaker 1: Okay, and he was born where?
Speaker 2: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania but was actually raised in Orange, Virginia.  So when he was two years old, his family brought him to Orange, Virginia.
Speaker 1: So, was like Orange, Virginia like the, the origin of the family, I mean, in terms of--
Speaker 2: The Lambert name, yeah.  Quite a few Lamberts there.  My father was, had, he was one of five brothers and on my father's side of the family, the only grandparent that I ever met was my father's mother [Sarah Lambert].  So I grew up as a young, as a child never really having known grandparents and even with my father's mother, probably by the time I was seven years old or so, she had passed.  So, you know, it's oftentimes interesting to me when I listen to my peers or, you know, kids that I grew up with and they would talk about relationships with their grandparents, I never experienced that. They were all dead, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what were, what kind of stories did your father tell about growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, my father, you know, he grew up on a farm.  So, you know, lots of stories about farming.  I remember, we went to visit my father's mother, and again I probably was about maybe five or six years old then, and so, then she went out that morning to milk a cow and to bring milk back in the house for my brother [Sherman Lambert] and I to have cereal.  It's the first time I ever had milk that way and just couldn't eat it.  You know, quite frankly, couldn't eat it but my father, you know, talked about his experience growing up and that's the way they really kind of grew up, working on the farm, you know, certainly they had many crops.  And so he worked the farm, you know, did a lot of that but then at some point decided to, you know, to leave and to come to Washington, D.C.  Obviously, he knew, he told me that he wanted to go into ministry and so was always very close to the word and, you know, knew that he was going into ministry, he was going to be a preacher, so, but, he was a farm boy.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did he become a minister?
Speaker 2: Father--both my parents were ministers.  Both were Baptist ministers and my father actually became a pastor of a church for a while here in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay, which one?
Speaker 2: I, you know, I don't remember the name of the church now and whatever the church was, I'm sure it's probably no longer in existence at this point; but, but yeah.
Speaker 1: Is this a Baptist church?
Speaker 2: Baptist church, yes.
Story_ID: 648517
Speaker 1: Now, you said your parents [Arnitha Green Allen and George H. Lambert, Sr.] met at, at Howard seminary [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?  Or, no (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, this was Washington Baptist Seminary [Washington Baptist Theological Seminary, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay, Washington Baptist, okay.
Speaker 2: Washington Baptist Seminary.
Speaker 1: Okay, Washington Baptist Seminary, okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: And the fascinating thing about that, I remember my mother sharing with me that, that used to be part of their dating.  So they would meet for a date at the seminary and study together and, and, you know, eventually, I guess, they got married but that's kind of, he kind of courted her as a, you know, certainly were at the seminary.
Speaker 1: Now was this a black seminary or was it--
Speaker 2: It, it was, it was, and if, you know, I haven't really done that much research on it but, but it's, I don't think--it's no longer in existence now.  So, where the convention center is in downtown Washington [Walter E. Washington Convention Center, Washington, D.C.], there's a building that kind of sits across the street there.  That building at one point used to be the seminary.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did the seminary, was it affiliated with the National Baptist Convention [National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.], do you know?
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay, that being the largest black organization around?
Speaker 2: It may have been.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it may have been.
Speaker 1: It could have been.  I was just thinking it might have been 'cause, you know, they, Baptists have that as a structure but each church is in- is independent I know.
Speaker 2: Very true.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, but they all belong to, well most of the black ministers belong to the National Baptist Convention, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you know, yeah, it's interesting, okay.  So, is there a story about how they met?  Did they talk about what they were doing?
Speaker 2: No, you know, I don't know exactly how they met.  Again, they were both interested in the ministry.  And so, here's, here's the other thing you must take into consideration as well.  For, for females, you know, many times pastors and churches would close their pulpits off for actually females coming to preach or to, you know, to pastor.  And so my mother, she really kind of struggled through that for many years and I remember, my brother [Sherman Lambert] and I, we were growing up, you know, it was always a delight when she was invited to come to speak at a church because that meant to some extent that that particular pastor and that particular congregation there, they perhaps would have been considered a bit on the liberal side in terms of inviting a woman minister to come and to preach and to speak at that church.  I, one of the things, certainly I think in celebration of my parents and so it's a work that I've started on, it's a work that's not complete at this point, is doing a book about both of my parents and really it's taking their sermons and then I still have many of their sermons, but taking their sermons and then writing about how their sermons have ministered in my life.  So it's taking their sermons and then through me talking about just interesting points in my life when I've kind of turned back reading one of those sermons and lifting some things out of those sermons that have certainly helped me to navigate to, to, to another point.
Story_ID: 648518
Speaker 1: Two questions.  One, I want to go back to, I is there--do you know of any stories, or any scenarios where your mother [Arnitha Green Allen] was actually turned away from a church?
Speaker 2: Sure, yeah.  That, that happened often, that happened often and I don't recall which churches or whatever but that did happen often and, and then even times when we would be, when we would go to various churches and, you know, it is kind of the protocol that is oftentimes a custom of a church that if there is a, a minister within the congregation that that minister would certainly be recognized.  I remember sitting, from time to time, in various congregations in churches with my mother and so whoever the pastor was at that particular church, would acknowledge and certainly recognize all of the male ministers there but would not recognize my mother as a minister.  So that was very painful for her.  So, you know, maybe I kind of lived through part of the, the women's rights, so to speak, but this is more in the ministry but the women's rights movement at a very early age, kind of watching the experience of my mother dealing with that.
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about the minister who ordained her, 'cause whoever it was they were like, they, it was an act of bravery or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  It was an act of bravery and, and I guess, you know, I really salute that particular minister.  I mean, I don't recall exactly a lot about the minister at this point but I just recall that, yep, you know, there was a minister that we, she knew and, you know, he wanted to do it; and was very open about then after doing it having her on maybe one Sunday a month that would, you know, certainly bring the sermon at this particular church.
Story_ID: 648519
Speaker 1: Now did they attend the same church all the way, I mean, throughout their, their lives or did they--?
Speaker 2: No, you know, my parents, and it's interesting, inasmuch as both of them were in the ministry but, but they're divorced, and, and, and for me, you know, I kind of look back on it now and I guess there was a point earlier where you just kind of thought, well, you know, if you're both in the ministry you just don't do that. But for whatever reason, and I don't know the reasons, you know, but they did.  And so, they, you know, they both just went on with their lives.  I mean my father [George H. Lambert, Sr.] continued to, you know, to preach and became very instrumental in a couple of churches down in Orange, Virginia, and then, you know, as I said at some point, was a co-pastor of a church here in the district but they went their separate ways and so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now where is Orange in relationship to D.C. [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Orange, Virginia is actually about maybe twenty miles outside of Charlottesville, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So from D.C., you're probably talking about maybe a good, I don't know, hour to about an hour, fifteen minutes or so away.
Speaker 1: And Charlottesville is where [President] Thomas Jefferson's home [Monticello] is.
Speaker 2: Thomas Jefferson and the University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia] is there as well, so, so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now when you, so you don't know why they split but--
Speaker 2: Don't know.
Speaker 1: --I'm going to ask it, well, did you live with your mother [Arnitha Green Allen] or your father?
Speaker 2: No, we, we lived with, we lived with my mother and my father, of course, had visitations with us on, on the weekends.  So many weekends we would spend with my father and during the week we were with, with my mother and, and it worked.  You know, it, it worked.  I will tell you that life for her really changed and, and so it was, it was challenging based on that but it really did change.
Speaker 1: In what, what ways did her life change?
Speaker 2: So, at one point, we, so I recall when we were very young, and not long after they did separate and finally divorced, we lived in a public housing facility called Barry Farms [Barry Farm], which, in Washington, D.C., really has a lot of history with it but Barry Farms was a major public housing development here in the District of Columbia.  And so that's--
Speaker 1: That's Barry Farms--
Speaker 2: It's called Barry Farms, yeah.
Speaker 1: Barry, B-E--
Speaker 2: B-E-R-R-Y [sic.]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Farms.  It goes back, I think, you know, to the Civil War era and all of that and there's a lot of history on it here in the District of Columbia, but we lived there, and I don't know, we were probably there for about maybe two or three years or so.  And so, you know, she was just trying to get her roots or whatever and, you know, just certainly better her family in terms of her two boys [Lambert and his brother, Sherman Lambert] but, but yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now were the projects stigmatized in those days or--
Speaker 2: You said were they stigmatized?
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause there's some, if you go back early enough, projects were a move up for a lot of people.  They felt like they really, you know--
Speaker 2: Well, I don't think my mother saw it as a move up. I know she clearly, she didn't consider it a move up. She clearly saw it as a move, as a, this is what I need to do now and eventually to move out and so we did.  As I said, there wasn't, I know it wasn't longer than three years, it was probably about two years or so that we were there and then we did, we did move out.  I think about it now from time to time and really, a mother doing what she had to do just to really kind of better the lives of her son.  Interesting experience for me, I really think back on it.  You know, I recall many years later when I became an adult, and I don't want to jump too far ahead, but what, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll share something as I was thinking about when we get a little bit further ahead.
Story_ID: 648520
Speaker 1: Well, here's a, a question I always ask then in the interim.  When you consider your mother's personality, your father's personality, their sense of humor, their political views, their--how they walk, how they talk, what they look like, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Probably my father [George H. Lambert, Sr.] in the sense of that, my father had a very composed spirit about him.  My mother in the sense of the strong, the spirit of advocacy or whatever and truth be told, my mother in the pulpit, I always thought really could out preach my father.  My mother, if my mother were living today, and you knew that I was her son, then people would really kind of describe me, well that is, and they would call it, 'cause my mother got married again, so, and they became Allen [Arnitha Green Allen], "That is Mother Allen's son."  My mother would tear a pulpit up, she really would.  She could just really bring the word and, and she could, not that my father, you know, could not, but my mother really was able to do it in a way that would cap- you know, really kind of captivate the, the audience and the congregation there.  So she was a gifted minister, she really was.
Story_ID: 648521
Speaker 1: Now you have the one brother, Sherman [Sherman Lambert], right?
Speaker 2: I have a brother, Sherman, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, and he's now an attorney?
Speaker 2: He is an attorney, a Howard law [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] grad- graduate as well, and so, so yeah.  He lives, he's in West Virginia now, so yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, tell us a little about him.
Speaker 2: Well, so, you know, we, we both grew up together and very close growing up.  You know, we were only fifteen months apart so therefore we did, you know, quite a few things together.  Both ran track and he, his, his ability to run track certainly at some point, you know, just certainly outweighed mine because he went on and broke records, both in, when we were in Pennsylvania [York, Pennsylvania] for a while and then various meets that he would go to around the country as well.  So, but, you know, just both, was just a delight growing up together.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and so--
Speaker 2: Are you picking this up?  I--this is going off and I meant to take it off.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah, go ahead.
Speaker 2: Okay, I'm sorry, yeah, I forgot.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Very (unclear).
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, so we were just talking about growing up.  Your brother was a track athlete and--
Speaker 2: My brother ran track, was a very good track ran--runner, really excelled well in it and broke several track records, then decided, you know, he wanted to go onto, to law school.  My brother will be, he's being recognized by his undergrad school as a, for, what was it in?  Outstanding alumni of the school, so really very proud of him.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Lifetime achievement award, I think is what he's being recognized as, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, so it was the two of you.  How old were you when your parents split up?
Speaker 2: Probably about maybe four or five.
Speaker 1: Okay, so (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I was very young, very young, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you basically grew up with your mother [Arnitha Green Allen]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you and your brother--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you could, you saw your father [George H. Lambert, Sr.] from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --periodically? Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was always engaged in our life, yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 648522
Speaker 1: Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Earliest childhood memory?  I'm sure I do.  You know, so, I remember kind of a, having some sense of, we just didn't have all of the things that perhaps I knew I was going to, you know, we just didn't have all of the things in life.  And so when we lived in Barry Farms [Barry Farm, Washington, D.C.], one of the things was very clear to me, we had, two of my mother's brothers would visit and then from time to time we'd go spend time with them.  So already I was forming some, you know, some observation around what we did and did not have, that just became very clear because they did and we did not.  So that just really became very clear but I also remember both my mother [Arnitha Green Allen] and my father [George H. Lambert, Sr.] being caring parents, okay, so, there are no memories that they were not parents that really cared about my brother [Sherman Lambert] and I, I just remember that they had very limited resources; and, and, so, so yeah, that was very clear.
Story_ID: 648523
Speaker 1: Can you describe the neighborhood you--did, now you didn't grow up in Barry Farms [Barry Farm, Washington, D.C.], but you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I didn't grow up in Barry Farms--
Speaker 1: You had two years, right--
Speaker 2: --we only lived there for about two years and then we actually lived all over the city, in Washington, D.C.  We, we lived in Southwest, Southeast, Northwest, so we lived all over the city and so I lived, we lived here in the city until my brother [Sherman Lambert] and I were, or at least I was about thirteen years old and, unfortunately, you know, a mother trying to raise two challenging sons and so at some point my brother and I, we just, you know, we were mischievous, we started getting in trouble and my mother [Arnitha Green Allen] made a very critical decision to send us to a place called, York, Pennsylvania.  So I grew up here in D.C. until I was thirteen and then we went to a place called York, Pennsylvania.  She had just made a decision that she wanted to put us in a, what she felt would have been a better environment in terms of us growing up.  I didn't really realize that until many years later when, you know, kind of coming back to the city but here's the thing.  York, Pennsylvania was quite a transition for me because here in Washington, D.C., the school, I was in, a junior high school down in Southwest [Randall Junior High School], it's a school that's no longer here, so the school, 95 percent, maybe 99 percent of the students were African American and probably out of all of the teachers that were there, maybe only three or four that were really white.  So my entire universe was African American.  When we went to York, Pennsylvania, the school that I was in [William Penn Senior High School] probably about maybe only 5 percent of the students in the school there were African American and the only teacher that I had of color the whole time I was there, was the teacher, was the teacher that taught African American history [Haywood Knight (ph.)].  To- (background noise) totally changed my universe.
Story_ID: 648524
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were talking about the demographics in York and, compared to D.C [Washington, D.C.] (unclear).
Speaker 2: So, York, Pennsylvania was a very interesting experience in my life when my mother [Arnitha Green Allen] made the decision to send my brother [Sherman Lambert] and I both there.  And so the school that I was in here in Washington, D.C. [Randall Junior High School] was a junior high school so about 99 percent of the students were African American and only about maybe, I don't know, say three or four of the teachers in the school were white.  When I went, when we went to York, Pennsylvania, probably, maybe less than, I don't know, three percent or so of the students in the school system there were African American and the only teacher that I had of color the whole time that we were there was the teacher, the African American teacher that I took black history from [Haywood Knight (ph.)].  So just trying to adjust to the dynamics around that was, was just very challenging and, and the other part of that was is that when we initially went there, my mother did not come with us.  There was a very religious family that was there and so we went and we lived with them probably for, I don't know, maybe about six to eight months or so before my mother actually came because she needed to do some things here to really kind of transition to, you know, prepare to do that but she thought it was so urgent that she would move us and send us first so we, so we went.  Many years later, and I didn't recognize then how that experience changed my life because many years later in coming back to Washington, D.C., and so this was when I was an adult and this was when I was actually then working here in the district, and then not, not serving as president, CEO, of the Greater Washington Urban League [Washington, D.C.] then, but I remember I was in D.C. one night and I had a meeting and after the meeting, I was living in northern Virginia so I was headed out back home, so I was downtown, getting ready to, I was waiting on a bus, whatever, and I noticed this guy walked up to the, to the bus stop there and, you know, kind of looked at him and I could tell by just looking at him, he appeared to really have had a bit of a horrid life.  I'm looking at him trying to place where I knew him from and I noticed, and he's looking at me trying to place where he knew me from, didn't feel threatened by him or anything but, so we did, we started talking.  It turns out, he and I used to run in a little gang together and that was part of the whole reason why my mother wanted to get my brother and I out of D.C.  And so, as we were talking, he starts sharing with me all of the folks who were either incarcerated, who were out of D.C., or perhaps who, you know, were strung out on drugs or something like that, clearly the message for me was that, mom saved us, she really did because that was my universe then, that potentially could have been my destiny, okay.  And so I will always have to credit her for that inasmuch as, you know, D.C. was my home and I grew up here; but she recognized that, to save her son, she had to do that to get us out of here to put us into another environment.  So, so she did.
Story_ID: 648525
Speaker 1: So what, what neighborhoods did you live in?  Northwest, Southeast, (unclear) Southwest [Washington, D.C.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We lived all over the city and one of the fascinating things, and so I don't know this either, one of the--and I guess it was, she was just trying to do what she needed to do to survive, is that my father [George H. Lambert, Sr.] sometime would make the joke when he would on weekends come to pick my brother [Sherman Lambert] and I up and he would say that, well you know, he was coming to a new address, mom [Arnitha Green Allen] moved a lot, you know, and just maybe it was about that each, with each move, she was really trying to better our circumstance in terms of where we were living at, but she did, she moved a lot.  So we lived all over the city.  At one point, we're out--this office is now, we lived at 15th [Street] and Harvard [Street], you know, the Urban League [Greater Washington Urban League, Washington, D.C.] now is at 14th [Street] and Harvard.  So at one point in my life, I lived one block away from where this office is at now.
Speaker 1: Okay, so do you remember any of the schools you attended in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: We attended H.D. Cooke School [H.D. Cooke Elementary School, Washington, D.C.], we attended Birney School [James G. Birney Elementary School; Thurgood Marshall Academy], which is over, it's over in Barry Farms [Barry Farm, Washington, D.C.].  So I've--Randall Junior High School [Washington, D.C.] which is no longer a high school at this point, so yeah, I remember some of the schools.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and do you remember the name of the gang you were in?
Speaker 2: The gang had no name, it was just, you know, I guess we weren't that formal then.  It was just a group of guys hanging out and, you know, just trying to figure out what we could do, you know, some of the mischief that we would get involved in and I seem to recall there was one thing that we were in a, it was a drugstore one night and something happened, somebody said something to someone so the police were called and so we were all held and detained and so our parents had to come get us.  And so that was kind of the straw for my mother, the straw that broke the camel's back, so to speak, for her, that it was time for her to really change, change our, our environment.
Story_ID: 648526
Speaker 1: So you would have been, you moved to York in--?
Speaker 2: I was thirteen.
Speaker 1: Thirteen and that would, that would make it like 1964?
Speaker 2: Somewhere in there.  I know it was in the '60s [1960s], yeah.
Speaker 1: Sixty-four [1964], '65 [1965], yeah.  Any rate, well--
Speaker 2: So what I do recall, it was in the '60s [1960s] is when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed, we were living in York, Pennsylvania then because I recall watching on TV the riots that were happening here on 7th Street in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and just, you know, thinking, wow, we probably would have been very much a part of that had we still been living here but I do recall had not been long after we had moved to York when that happened.
Speaker 1: Okay, now how were, now, York, Pennsylvania is near where?
Speaker 2: So York, Pennsylvania is straight up 83 [Interstate 83], fifty miles north of Baltimore [Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So how were you treated in the school [William Penn Senior High School, York, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: You know, I think we were treated well.  Teachers that, you know, many of the teachers that I had, I think we were engaged, you know, I was a, I had some of the, I was in some of the advance classes so I felt very good about that but there weren't a whole lot of other African American students that were in those classes as well.  I, I had, you know, quite a few white friends which I had never had here in Washington, D.C. because that wasn't, again, my universe, so to speak, but more importantly than that for me, I think the York experience really did kind of position me in a way that I could feel comfortable in both communities so in a community other than an African American community because, again, that wasn't my universe, that wasn't my experience here.  So had it not been for that experience, probably would have felt very uncomfortable.  So York, Pennsylvania did do that for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, now were you a good student?
Speaker 2: Yeah I was a good student.  I was a very good student, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, AP [advanced placement] classes in, there in York, that's a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a very good student.
Speaker 1: Now what were you interested in?
Speaker 2: So, you know, the, I had two teachers that probably influenced and excited me about learning, maybe, so it was my, the black history teacher that I had and there was an English teacher that I had as well and, and the English teacher, more around the classics.  So, Shakespeare [William Shakespeare] and, you know, a lot of those kind of things which never thought, you know, I'd have an interest in any of that but reading those, you know, reading, reading a lot of that and I enjoyed it, interesting enough.  I, I just, I really enjoyed it and then the black history teacher that I had as well.
Speaker 1: Do you remember his name?
Speaker 2: His name was, his name was Dr. Knight, Dr. Haywood Knight [ph.], and he was a, he was a minister, he was a reverend as well, but Dr. Haywood Knight.
Speaker 1: Okay, was he the only black teacher in the school?
Speaker 2: The, one of the, one of the coaches was black there as well.  So probably no more than three at most.
Speaker 1: Okay, were they both, like, natives of, of--
Speaker 2: Dr. Knight was not.  Actually, he relocated there from, I think it was Richmond, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So this would have been when, the days when black history was starting to emerge as a subject?
Speaker 2: Black history was very much starting to emerge and I enjoyed the reading, you know, began to, he just excited me about, you know, various authors that were out there.  So, James Baldwin, you know, Malcolm X, I mean, James Farmer, you know, I could just go on and on and on.  Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture], so, yeah, all of them, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. So all right. What did you like to do when you were growing up?  Did you like music, television or dancing, sports?
Speaker 2: Well I ran track and so I did enjoy running track, you know, loved, loved that.  I became involved in the drama theater at the school as well.  So, you know, we'd put on a couple of plays or whatever.  So I really enjoyed that.  I became involved in one of the literary societies there.  So, did enjoy that.  Kind of a bit, maybe, a bit of an activist student.  I can't remember the exact issue or the cause, but I remember being, being engaged in a couple of marches or whatever.  So, so yeah.
Speaker 1: The Vietnam War movement.
Speaker 2: Maybe the Vietnam War, I don't really remember exactly what now but, yeah.
Speaker 1: Was there a civil rights struggle in York before you got there or what?
Speaker 2: You know, there was, there was probably a bit of a civil rights struggle in the sense that there were no African Americans on city council in terms of, you know, in, in, with regard to the electoral process there.  So, we had no presence, no representation there.  I mean, you know, kind of, many of the dynamics, if you will, that would, you would kind of expect in a small town like that but, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, did you run for student body president or anything like that, or student council (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not in high school.  We get later to college [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia], I did, but, but not in high school, but yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Story_ID: 648527
Speaker 1: So your favorite te- teachers were Reverend Knight [Haywood Knight (ph.)] and who else was, is it the--?
Speaker 2: And I'm trying to remember the English teacher and I can see her face, cannot remember her name, wow, yeah.  I can see her face still.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what did you prognosticate as your career, you know, when you're in high school [William Penn Senior High School, York, Pennsylvania]?  Did you have, were you thinking like that, that I'm going to be this or that?
Speaker 2: Dr. Knight was the person who really kind of got me thinking and very interested in going to college.  Although my mother [Arnitha Green Allen] quite frankly was really pushing that and that was, you know, her vision that my brother [Sherman Lambert] and I we were both going to go to college.  She still did not have a buy in from me.  I heard it and I was very clear that that's what she wanted but, you know, I hadn't really bought into it.  Quite frankly, if I recall at the time, I really had an interest, I was like, "Well, you know, I'm going to do [U.S.] military," and I don't know what it was, it was something about the military just really excited me but it was really Dr. Knight that kind of came along and reinforced that and then really kind of got me excited about it.  It was interesting when I decided that I was going to go to college, I decided not only was I going to go to college but I was going to major in black history and because, you know, I was learning so much, I enjoyed the readings and so it really resonated with me.  So, so, that's, yeah, but that's, that was kind of the push to go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is, you're a senior, what, in 1971? Is that true?
Speaker 2: Seventy [1970], yes, some- yeah, early '70s [1970s], yeah.
Story_ID: 648528
Speaker 1: Did you have an official counselor in school?
Speaker 2: You--the question, did I have an official counselor?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Did have a counselor, but, you know, if I recall, don't recall really having that many conversations with the counselor about going to college.  Interestingly enough there, many of the students did not go to college when they finished high school, in particular, the African American students.  If I recall, again, out of my graduating class [at William Penn Senior High School, York, Pennsylvania], probably be close to maybe, I don't know, three hundred or so, there were only about maybe forty African Americans that graduated in that class.  Out of the forty or so of us that graduated, probably, I don't know, maybe, five, seven at most, that went to college.  Most of the students then would come out of school, graduate and then go work in the, in the factories there, and you made good money, quite frankly, you really made good money.  Borg-Warner [Borg-Warner Corporation; BorgWarner Inc.] was there, Cate- Borg-Warner, the company, Borg-Warner was there, Caterpillar [Caterpillar Inc.] was there, the barbell company [York Barbell] was there, Harley-Davidson was there, I mean, all of these companies, and so, the kids who graduated, they went and worked in the factories, made great salaries.  So, so, yeah, so that was kind of the life, just didn't go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, now, did Dr. Knight [Haywood Knight (ph.)] encourage you to apply ahead of time?  Did you, did you have a--
Speaker 2: I did. Dr. Knight encouraged me to apply ahead of time.  Dr. Knight also encouraged me to take a couple of courses.  There's also a college in York, Pennsylvania called York College [York College of Pennsylvania], so he encouraged me to take a couple courses at York College.  And so what I did, and that really kind of helped me as well and those were, if I recall, they were writing courses because he said, "You're going to be doing a lot of essays in college and all of those kind of things." So I think it helped strengthen, you know, when I was applying to college as well.  So, and then really kind of put me in the framework, in the mind of, of college as well, so he did.
Story_ID: 648529
Speaker 1: So, did you apply to more than one school?
Speaker 2: I applied to about five, maybe six or so schools and that was an interesting experience in itself.  I got accepted at Lincoln University [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania].  Got accepted at, I think it was Howard University [Washington, D.C.], Towson, which is in the Baltimore [Maryland] area, or whatever.  There were a couple that I did not get accepted at and so, maybe I got accepted at three, didn't get accepted at two or three others, so, so yeah.  I got accepted at Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia], that's where I ended up going.  I, you know, Howard University, I made a quick decision on that because my concern was coming back to D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and my concern was, if I came back, would I kind of get involved with kind of the crowd that I used to run with.  And so I just made a very quick decision that, you know, I was not going to come to, to D.C. and come to Howard.  Lincoln University, I had a very good friend who had gone to Lincoln University and I actually had, I went to Lincoln University for a couple of homecomings, or whatever, and so I was really giving it very consideration--very serious consideration to Lincoln University.  Then also, Towson State [Towson State College; Towson University, Towson, Maryland] at the time was only about maybe 6 percent or so, I think, African American and, you know, I had made a decision that I really wanted to now kind of come back and have the African American experience as opposed to kind of the experience in York, Pennsylvania, not that the York, Pennsylvania experience was a bad experience, I just felt it was an isolated experience.  And so, now, you know, I was at a point in my life, I wanted to come back and have the black experience, so to speak, if you will.  So, Virginia Union, I got accepted there and Virginia Union had been the undergraduate school where Reverend Knight [Haywood Knight (ph.)] had gone to as well and he talked a lot about it and encouraged me to, perhaps to go and visit the campus and so I did and when I went, you know, visited the campus, I enjoyed it and I was like, well, you know, this is probably the right place for me to come.  And so that, I made the decision and that's where I would go.
Speaker 1: Okay, now Howard University had the strongest, I guess, Afro studies department [Department of Afro-American Studies].
Speaker 2: They did.
Speaker 1: And so was that, did you consider that when you--
Speaker 2: I considered it but, again, I wasn't operating on that, you know.  My mindset was that coming back into the environment that I had been in in D.C., you know, and that's kind of where I was at.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause Howard had the strongest in the country at that point.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they did, yeah, yeah, yeah, they did.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Russell Adams was the chair, I know some of the people there--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --teaching there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and the other thing may have been, may have been money as well because I needed, you know, I needed scholarship money, I needed financial aid money, interesting enough; and I think maybe Virginia Union stepped up to the plate and gave more than, than Howard was giving at the time, so that was probably a part of it as well.
Story_ID: 648530
Speaker 1: Okay, now Virginia Union is, well tell us a little, little bit about the school because it's not, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, Virginia Union is in Richmond, Virginia and really a lot of, I'd say, great folks have graduated from Virginia Union.  The first African American governor, Doug Wilder [HistoryMaker L. Douglas Wilder], graduated from Virginia Union.  Former Congressman, Walter Fauntroy [HistoryMaker Reverend Walter Fauntroy] graduated from Virginia Union, so it's a, it's a long list of folks who came out of school.  Also they have a very strong seminary there [Samuel DeWitt Proctor School of Theology of Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia] and so many, many well known ministers from around the country went to the seminary at Virginia Union University.
Speaker 1: Now, it's not a black school, right?
Speaker 2: No, Virginia Union is a--
Speaker 1: It is?
Speaker 2: --is a, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's an HBCU [historically black colleges and universities].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is.
Speaker 1: Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University] is right there too--
Speaker 2: Virginia State is about thirty miles, that's down the road, yeah, Petersburg, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, okay
Speaker 2: Virginia Union is an HBCU.
Speaker 1: All right, okay, all right, all right.  So that makes more sense.  I mean, there was, I, you know, there's Virginia Commonwealth [Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia] and then--
Speaker 2: There's VCU, Virginia Commonwealth, VCU, but Virginia Union sits right there as well.  So, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So I wanted the HBCU experience and Virginia Union really kind of, you know, gave me what I was looking for there.
Speaker 1: Okay, you may be the first person I've interviewed that actually went to Virginia U--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --'cause, as such, but I get it confused with Virginia State a lot.
Speaker 2: Virginia State is in Petersburg, that's about another thirty miles or so away, but yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, right, but that area around there is so historic.
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: The Civil War history, your Revolutionary War history, even Jamestown [Virginia] is not too far away from there.
Speaker 2: That's true, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, who were, who were some of your major influences at Virginia Union?
Speaker 2: Well, so, pretty much all of the instructors that I had at Virginia Union, you know, it was a good experience for me but what happened with me at Virginia Union, so kind of, again, another inflection point, if you will.  I went to Virginia Union wanting to major, become a African American studies or black history major and for whatever reason, while Virginia Union at the time did have a course of study in that program, but for whatever reason dropped it and decided that, you know, they just didn't have it anymore.  And so then I had to make a decision, well, did I want to leave Virginia Union or did I want to major in something else.  So at the time, Virginia Union was onboarding a new field of studies called, urban studies, and I remember this very dynamic instructor who was really going to, he was a doctor, and who was really going to head it and started, you know, convening meetings with some of the students to see if they had an interest in becoming a part of that particular major.  And so I did and all of the instructors that I had in the urban studies program were dynamic, were exciting, many of them, quite frankly, were adjunct instructors so, you know, clearly folks who, this wasn't their full time job teaching but they were in other disciplines in terms of their full time job but folks who were, they brought the practical experience of it.  And so, all of that was very exciting for me, it intrigued me; and, and so that's how I kind of ended up graduating as an urban studies major, rather than as a black history major.
Story_ID: 648531
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, urban studies departments at a lot of universities are, yeah, as you said, they are very, they're closely associated with black studies in the sense that our urban, you know, environments have more black pe- people than--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --white people in many cities, you know.
Speaker 2: And this was during the time, if you think back on it that, when we had kind of this on burst of many of the African American mayors in cities across the country, where, you know, these mayors where they were African American and so it was, so it was fascinating.  You know, it was just all that excitement kind of going on, so, so yeah.
Speaker 1: Seventy-one [1971] to '75 [1975] you would have had the emergence of [HistoryMaker] Kenneth Gibson and--
Speaker 2: Kenneth Gibson.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Richard Hatcher.
Speaker 2: All of them, yeah.
Speaker 1: Even Walter Washington.
Speaker 2: Walter Washington, that's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Maynard Jackson in '75 [sic. 1974] in Atlanta [Georgia] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Maynard Jackson, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this is, and the, '72 [1972], now did you attend the National Black Political Convention in Gary [Indiana]?
Speaker 2: I did not, no.  No, I did not.
Speaker 1: Were you aware of it or--
Speaker 2: I was aware of it but I did not attend it, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know a lot of people didn't go but it was a major happening that, did you know people who attended?
Speaker 2: I'm sure I knew some folks who, who attended, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you have, were there activities on campus that were focused on black politics?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was, in fact, so you asked a little bit earlier about leadership.  So I served as leadership in student government.  I was a vice president of student government at Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia].  I also pledged a fraternity as well, so I'm a Kappa [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity], so it was, Paul Mark's [ph.] a president of my fraternity there as well but as vice president of student government, you know, I think we did some things there that were dynamic in a way, that were game changers in a way and the, in the sense of some of the speakers that we brought there.  So [HistoryMaker] Nikki Giovanni, for example, was one of the speakers that we decided to bring. Louis Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] was one of the speakers that we decided to bring in.  If you recall, Louis Farrakhan was very controversial.  In fact, I think I even recall that the, the university even had a little bit of a concern about us, you know, inviting him to come.  The other person, and he wrote the book, and I'm blocking on his name now but, wrote the book, 'Trick Baby,' he was a, he lived a life as a pimp or whatever--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Iceberg Slim.
Speaker 2: Iceberg Slim.  Iceberg Slim was a--
Speaker 1: I don't know if that's his real name but--
Speaker 2: --Ice- yeah, Iceberg Slim was another one of the speakers.  I mean, we really were very, we were very diverse, I guess if you will in terms of the kind of speakers that we brought to the school but we thought, you know, that was important for folks to really get a good sense of, you know, just a number of the speakers and folks who were kind of lecturing on, you know, what was happening in black America and all of those things.  So, so yeah, so we did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory was another one that we brought in.  In fact I still, to this day, have a photograph that the local newspaper came and, and took of Dick Gregory when we brought him to speak.
Speaker 1: In terms of national leadership in those days, did you have any, you know a particular favorite leader in the black community?
Speaker 2: You know, again, I was a prolific reader, if you will, then, and so many of the, you know, the leaders I was reading, their material, their books, I just couldn't get it fast enough.  So, I don't know if there were any particular one.  I just thought that they all had a very strong message and just couldn't wait, you know, to really kind of soak up what the message was.  So, but I, I really did.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause you had emerging, you know, Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson], I mean--
Speaker 2: I mean, Jesse Jackson, interesting about Jesse Jackson is, we never brought him to Virginia Union to speak but for the first time I ever heard Jesse Jackson speak it was not on a black campus, it was on a white campus and for me that was very, you know, very interesting, University of Gettysburg [sic. Gettysburg College, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania], and so I kind of took my hat off to the student because the student government there invited him to come speak and I remember traveling to the University of Gettysburg to hear Jesse Jackson speak.  So that was my first time hearing him speak.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now this is, yeah, this is the black power era, this is--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --black political power, you have the so called, blaxploitation movies--
Speaker 2: That's right, all of that, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and you have a lot of, everybody has an Afro and--
Speaker 2: Afro, I had a large Afro, yeah--
Speaker 1: --and, yes, right. And--
Speaker 2: --yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: People, students would greet each other like this--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: --in those days.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 648532
Speaker 1: So, I mean, it's a time period that was really different from the way, what it is today in some ways; and then some ways it was similar in that some of the same things are going on today were going on then and, and were you all concerned about, you know, racial profiling and, any of that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes, but if you, I don't know, if you picked up many of the, the writings, you know, like Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and even Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson], many of his writings and James Baldwin, you could almost, and if you didn't really look at the cover of the book and the year that when the book was written, you could almost open many of those texts now and say, well this is something that, you know, was written today or within the past year or so because a lot of the things that they were talking about and advocating for it then, to some extent, you know, we fast forward fifty years and we're still there, you know, we're still there.  And so it's just a very interesting place to be in.  Martin Luther King talked a whole lot then about the sense of urgency of now, the fierce sense of urgency of now.  We're still in the fierce sense of urgency of now.
Story_ID: 648533
Speaker 1: Now were you a member of any organizations in those days?  Did you, did you join NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or the, or any of the (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did not join the NAACP.  I remember going to a, quite a few NAACP meetings but did not join the NAACP.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they always had a strong youth (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They did, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Urban League [National Urban League] is on some campuses too.  Was there a chapter of Urban League on the campus?
Speaker 2: There was not but my connect- (background noise)--I am so sorry, yeah.
Speaker 1: It's okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was asking about the Urban League on campus.  Were they--did they have a presence on campus?
Speaker 2: My connection, we did, no, the Urban League did not have a presence on the campus.  My connection with the Urban League was the director of the Urban League's, the urban studies program that, that I was involved in, when she left the, left Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia], she came to head the Northern Virginia branch of the Washington Urban League [Northern Virginia Urban League, Alexandria, Virginia] and I was a senior at that time.  And so, reach back with me and it was not long, and then I graduated and, you know, we stayed connected and said to me, you know, "We'd really love for you to consider coming and working for the Urban League."  And so I'm still in Richmond [Virginia], she was in Alexandria, Virginia at the time.  So we continued to talk but about a year or so later, I did come and came to work for her as a community organizer and so that's when my career with the Urban League began.  And so fast forward, I don't know, thirty some years later, or whatever, you know, still very much engaged with the Urban League movement (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, now, what was her name?  What was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Angie Currant [ph.].
Speaker 1: Angie Currant, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Angela Currant.
Story_ID: 648534
Speaker 1: When I served in student government at Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia], one of the things that our student government association were instrumental in doing was getting the school to move to coed dorms and so we were able to do it with one dorm.  Now I got to tell you, that was a big deal, okay.  That was a big deal because most schools were very clear that you did not have coed dorms.  I mean, you think, you know, you fast forward to today, we wouldn't--we don't give it a thought but back when I was coming along, no, there were men's dorms and ladies dorms but a coed dorm, no way (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, where the line was drawn was between the black schools and the white schools and the state schools.  I mean, the black schools did not have coed dorms--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --but everybody else did pretty much.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, yeah, so we--
Speaker 2: So that was the--
Speaker 1: --yeah, like I said, it was a big deal.  We were instrumental in doing that.  So--
Speaker 2: The black schools were operating on a different code of conduct that goes all the way back to the 19th century.
Speaker 1: Well, what--I don't know, yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean in terms of, you know, the hours and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you could only visit during certain times--
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: --it was really true.  I mean, Central State [Central State University] in Wilberforce [Ohio] couldn't do, the students there couldn't do what we could do at Wright State [Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio]--
Speaker 1: You're right.
Speaker 2: --or the University of Dayton [Dayton, Ohio], you couldn't do it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, I, I recognize that then that was a real big thing, in fact, so much so that we had, Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] and some of the other HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] around the country reached out to us and were, you know, asking us, "Well how did we do that?" And, you know, giving them some insight on all of that as well but it was, it was a big deal, yeah.
Speaker 2: So did you win that struggle?
Speaker 1: Well, no, we did.  I mean, I'm saying the school, they did, they won in the dorms.  The following year they put in place as a coed dorm.  Now, of course, there were a lot of restrictions and rules around it but the fact that it was done, so yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: And your parents had to give permission for you to, you know, to go into that dorm as well, so, so yeah.
Story_ID: 648535
Speaker 1: Any other issues on campus [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia] that you--?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm, I'm sure there were others, but, you know, I, I, as I said, I, I do recall that.  I recall, you know, the City of Richmond [Virginia] at the time was going through the whole issue around annexation and so this is when the city decided that they were going to annex part of a, I think it was Henrico County [Virginia] and the whole, the concern for the African American community then was diluting the vote (background noise) the City of Richmond then was really going through the whole issue of annexation.  And so this was the time when, I think it was the city council [Richmond City Council] decided that they wanted to annex Henrico County which is right adjacent to Richmond and the concern from the African American community was whether this was really going to dilute the vote of the African American community.  So I recall, we as a student government did become involved in that issue and which really kind of pushing the envelope in terms of not diluting the African American vote.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a tactic. I've heard about that in other cities too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: If the black, the urban population, and Richmond's population was probably mostly black--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --by that time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but the, the boundaries of Richmond and so the outer counties are mostly white.  So the idea was, is that if you then, you know, annex that and put that as part of the vote, then it would, in fact, at the end of the day, dilute the African American vote, so, it was a big issue, so.
Speaker 1: They would never say that.  I understand this is, this would put both governments together and mortgage--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was about, you know, consolidate the tax base--
Speaker 1: It would consolidate the tax base.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the base--you had to consolidate the tax base and the resources that were going to be able to be bought, you know, and all those kinds of things as well, so, so yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So, so you know, it was, it was almost a kind of a working lab for us to some extent as a urban studies student to really be engaged in an issue like that and just really understanding how government really works.  And so here's a, here's a working life, here's a real life situation of something that could happen, and right here in the city that we're in.
Story_ID: 648536
Speaker 1: Now were, were did you ever interact or meet with people of the old Richmond Improvement Association in Richmond [Virginia] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, so one of the things that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was an early civil rights--
Speaker 2: Yeah, one of the things that the urban studies program did, we had once a--we had a radio show.  And so, I recall being one of the students that was very much involved in the radio show so we would invite guests onto our radio show so I recall we did, we had the mayor on at one point, we had a couple of the councilmembers on it at one point.  There was a lady, if my memory serves me correctly, her name was Willie Dell and I know she was a councilperson on the Richmond City Council, she was an African American lady, very dynamic, very feisty lady, you know, there's really fighting, pushing back on this whole annexation piece.  So, so we engaged there--I did, one of my internships with the human rights department for the human rights commissioner, I should say, for the City of Richmond, and so for me, I kind of learned a whole lot there, it was very stimulating and getting a sense of what some of the, you know, that the human rights issues were that the cities began to deal with as well.
Speaker 1: Now, so were you, did you have a job offer before you graduated?
Speaker 2: Interesting you should ask that.  Yes I did, yeah, yes I did.  I was one of the, I was very fortunate, I was very blessed because I was one of the few students that actually had a job offer before I graduated so much so that the job I was offered, they wanted me to start in March and the head of my department at school [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia], I, you know, I went and shared with him, and so he met, he asked me, could he meet, this was the Richmond Community Action Program, so he asked me, could he meet with the director and explain to him that, you know, I was going to graduate in May, he was very delighted that they had offered me the job but was there any way that they could wait and keep the job for me so that I could start in May rather than in March.  And so, they, you know, they did do that for me but, but I felt very good about that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So this is the Richmond Community--
Speaker 2: Richmond Community Action Agency [sic.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) agency, okay.
Speaker 2: I think it was referred to the acronym for, was RCAP, if I, if I recall.
Story_ID: 648537
Speaker 1: So well, so was there anything that you remember about graduation [from Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia]?  Was it memorable in any way other than, I'm sure your mother [Arnitha Green Allen] was proud of you and your father [George H. Lambert, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: My mother was very proud of me.  One of the things I recall doing, I sat down and wrote a letter to my mother and I wrote a letter to my mother thanking her for all that she had done to make that day possible because she really did.  It was, you know, the sending money from time to time and, you know, I know that mom, the jobs that she was working just didn't really pay a lot for her so a lot of the sacrifice that she had made in terms of making that day possible and I recall when mom came down to the graduation, before we could even say, hello, she, she grabbed me, gave me a big hug and she, she just burst into tears.  She was so moved by the letter but, yeah, but I'll never forget that.  I sat down and wrote her a letter thanking her.
Speaker 1: And she had done so much to make that, this possible?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she did, she did.
Speaker 1: Was your father there too?
Speaker 2: My father did come to the graduation, yes, yes, yes he did.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now did you graduate with, with honors?
Speaker 2: If I recall, I just missed the line of graduate with honors.  So I probably graduated with a B average but, but I did not graduate cum laude, magna cum laude, so no, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you had, you graduated with a job?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah, I graduated with a job.  So that was a good thing, so yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes sir, so, so the Richmond Community Action Agency [sic. Richmond Community Action Program], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that was the name of it, yeah.
Story_ID: 648538
Speaker 1: Now you had, you said before you had done some community organizing in--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, community organizing when I was referring to the, around the annexation of Richmond [Virginia] at the time and so some of the key leaders had reached out to the student body and particularly the student government association at Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia] to ask us, I think we were helping to get out like leaflets and things like that, helping to organize some of the hearings so, so that was kind of my early exposure to community organizing, so yeah.
Speaker 1: Now did you ever get community organizing training anywhere?  I mean, formal training?
Speaker 2: My, not that I recall, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, not that I recall.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so how long were you at the, were you at the Richmond Community Action Agency [sic. Richmond Community Action Program]?
Speaker 2: I think no more than about maybe a year and a half, two years at most because that's when I then got the offer to come to work for the, for the Urban League [Northern Virginia branch of the Washington Urban League; Northern Virginia Urban League, Alexandria, Virginia] and that's why I mention Angela Currant [ph.] who had been a former professor of mine offered me a job and so that's when I, when I did come.
Story_ID: 648539
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so is this in Alexandria [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: This was in Alexandria, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what year is this?  This is?
Speaker 2: Wow, so that would have been seventy--late '70s [1970s], definitely in the late '70s [1970s], '77 [1977], '78 [1978], somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So what was, so what was the atmosphere like in Alexandria when you got there?  I know it's an old city.
Speaker 2: Historic city.
Speaker 1: Historic city--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in a historic district where people can't even change their buildings and--
Speaker 2: Ah, yeah, all of that, yeah.
Speaker 1: --it's an old area like that.
Speaker 2: In fact it's very interesting.  The City of Alexandria, a lot of folks don't know this but the school system there did not integrate until, in the 1970s and when I found--I was amazed but, but yeah, it was in 1970s that the Alexandria public school system [Alexandria City Public Schools] integrated.  So up until that point in time, it was a segregated system.  I still have so many friends and just very close associations of, of folks there who shared with me that when it was time for them to go to high school, they actually went to high school, came across the water, the Potomac [Potomac River], and the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.] is where they graduated high school, not in the City of Alexandria, so yeah.  So many of my contemporaries did not graduate from, T.C. Williams [T.C. Williams High School, Alexandria, Virginia] is the, it's the high school there but did not graduate from T.C. Williams, they graduated from high--from, many of the different high schools here in the District of Columbia.
Speaker 1: Gee, okay, so, so, but the general condition of black folks in Alexandria were just, what?
Speaker 2: Well, clearly, I mean, segregation was there.  It was during the period that I was there that the first African American [sic.] was elected to city council [Alexandria City Council], so I saw that, then eventually members being appointed and then finally elected to the school board so it was kind of an interesting time for me, interesting time to be a part of the Urban League [Northern Virginia branch of the Washington Urban League; Northern Virginia Urban League, Alexandria, Virginia], interesting time to, you know, really be advocating on a number of those issues.  I became very much involved in a number of the housing issues in Alexandria, Fairfax [Fairfax County, Virginia], throughout, so, so yeah, saving, saving African American communities, intervention if you will around school system where, you know, there was a, to some extent, African American students who were not in the advanced placement tracks, you know; and always kind of maintain that we should have just, you know, one, one school system.  So it was, it was an interesting period.
Story_ID: 648540
Speaker 1: Now, I know that for years, I knew that the Urban League was an established civil rights organization, or we saw it that way, along with NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and, you know, CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], maybe, some other, you know, in the '60s [1960s] but very few people could tell you what the Urban League actually does and, and I think, I think it's, it's something that, I mean, if you'd ask any black person what NAACP does, they'd probably tell you something but if you ask them what CORE does, they would tell you something but they could tell you who the director of the Urban League was and, and during the mid-'60s [1960s], Whitney Young was a hero but he's meeting with the president but somebody said, "What does Urban League really actually do?"  People would tell you so.  Give us some history of the Urban League.
Speaker 2: Sure.  So, NAACP, their beginning was in 1909, Urban League, 1910.  So they're really only one year apart in terms of, you know, really the launch of, of both the organizations.  NAACP really kind of took the leadership in terms of, of the civil rights and the very strong advocacy and so really would go to court, would litigate to all of those things.  And so as the NAACP, you know, moved the needle, so to speak in terms of the litigation and breaking down, you know, racial barriers and all of those things, and particularly in the South, there needed to be also an organization that as folks began to leave the South and then come to the North seeking better opportunities, to some extent, what they really found in the North, well there were still barriers in the North, okay.  There was still segregation in the schools.  There was still segregation in housing, I mean, many of those issues were, were here.  And so there needed to be an organization that while the NAACP to somebody that were kicking down those doors or really kind of breaking through those barriers, there needed to be an organization that would help people to really kind of deal with the issues in the, in the North as well and there was kind of the beginning of the Urban League helping persons to, you know, get housing, helping persons to understand that while, you know, this barrier's been taken down now with regard to housing opportunities, helping to navigate folks through the educational system.  So that's the community service, the social service arm that the Urban League brought.  Both organizations still very much involved in civil rights because the Urban League we had, it's a civil rights, you know, social service community based organization but the NAACP was the one, you know, really kind of doing the, the legal side of it.  The Urban League was the organization that really kind of managed social service programs whereas the NAACP, again, very strong on the civil rights front.  So, that's really kind of the beginning and the difference of the two organizations but always working closely together.
Speaker 1: Okay, I know the Urban League plays a role in creating partnerships with white business community for jobs, right?
Speaker 2: Many, many partnerships and so clearly with this Urban League [Greater Washington Urban League, Washington, D.C.] and, and National Urban League and a number of Urban Leagues around the country, we partner with any number of, of corporate organizations, very, and have been very strong partners with us as well, support us in a lot of the work that we do, you know, play a philanthropy role in terms of their charitable giving to the Urban League, oftentimes can be, you know, we work with them in terms of helping them to address issues around diversity in their workforce.  And so, it's, it's been a, it's been a strong partnership but it's been an interesting partnership and we support them on, you know, many of the issues that they have to address as well, so yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, I know--
Speaker 2: They serve on our boards of directors, so, so yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Urban League also plays a role in terms of, provides scholarships for college students.
Speaker 2: Provides the scholarships to the college students, many of the corporations as well, they support us in terms of giving dollars so that we can, you know, certainly give, pass those dollars along to, to students as well.  So, so yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot of, you know, but I think there's so many things done so that people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Workforce development, a lot of the work that we do in that space, we work with corporations where they have job opportunities and so, and then we even help a lot of them to identify, not only for entry level jobs but for many of their key leadership jobs as well.
Story_ID: 648541
Speaker 1: So what were some of the issues in Alexandria [Virginia] when you got there?  I know that you said the first Af- African American [sic.] was elected to city council [Alexandria City Council] shortly after you arrived; but, but was there, was education a priority or political--
Speaker 2: Educational issues, you know, I think it was a, it was a great concern around African American students having the same opportunities in, in the school system [Alexandria City Public Schools] that their white counterparts were having and even around, I recall, so many of the issues around standardized testing as well and how students were being prepared for tests.  It was always a major discrepancy between the testing of African American students and the white students.  And so clearly there we, you know, we had to kind of look at what the support systems, what was the school system doing in terms of embracing and ensuring that, you know, my kid, an African American kid and your kid, a white kid that should have nothing to do with it but ensuring that both of those students were on an even playing field with regard to the resources that the school made available to them.  So, so that was a major issue, you know, but around the standardized testing, around not a school operating within a school, major, major issue.
Speaker 1: So did, were you assigned to education or one of these, a specific area when you--
Speaker 2: So when I initially started my work with the Urban League [Northern Virginia branch of the Washington Urban League; Northern Virginia Urban League, Alexandria, Virginia] and as a community organizer, I actually had the housing portfolio.  We had someone else on the staff that had the education portfolio.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the housing issue was in Richmond [Virginia].  What were they?
Speaker 2: Well, it was Alexandria.  So the housing, yeah, no problem.  Again, you know, fair housing, there was a major redevelopment and the city at some point decided, and I'm trying to remember, Cameron Valley [Cameron Valley Housing, Alexandria, Virginia], I think was the name of the particular property and was a public housing property and the city decided that they were actually going to redevelop the property.  And so we were pulled in to help to give voice to the African American residents that were part of that property, if the city was going to sell the redevelopment of property and what was the plan in terms of, of relocation for the residents that were, you know, part of that property there.  So ensuring that there was a fair relocation plan, those who wanted to come back and showing that there would be an opportunity for, you know, for housing for them to come back to.  So all of those kind of issues were a part of what we, you know, we soon became engaged in in terms of, really trying to help the city and the elected officials to think through.  I even recall, because we just didn't, our footprint wasn't just Alexandria, it was also Fairfax County [Virginia] as well and I recall being involved in a very interesting issue in Fairfax County and at this, I can't quite remember the name of the particular community but it had been a historic African American community and so when Fairfax County was doing the expansion of some of the highways there, wanting to so the planning of it was to go directly through the middle of that community.  And so, again, we became involved and helped to give voice to, you know, redi- redirecting, if you will, those lines to, to go another direction so it would just not totally go directly through it, go directly through this historic African American community.  I remember there couldn't be any press conferences around that, you know, just drumming up major support around that issue and at the end of the day, we did prevail.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it makes you wonder if these are deliberate acts because there's so many cities report the same thing, through urban renewal--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --expansion of highways that they're often targeted to go directly through or over top of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --black communities.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There was a church [Alfred Street Baptist Church, Alexandria, Virginia] that had been in that community since the early 1800s.  And so, if I recall, the way the new highway lines were going to be drawn, it would have, the church, it would destroy that community, that church would no longer have been there and in fairness, I think, to the planners, I think they were offering to maybe move and relocate the church, that was going to be very expensive to do, but even with that, you know, just think about the sense of, many folks, as they get older, they look forward to coming back, you know, to a community, a place where you grew up, a place that really has meaning for you, so to relocate the church, while it was an interesting gesture, just really, just, you know, just paled, I think, to some extent, in terms of, of leaving it there and that community being undisturbed.
Story_ID: 648542
Speaker 1: So, now, how long did you serve in the--?
Speaker 2: Community organizer's role (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, fortunately for me, maybe a couple of years or so and then I left the Northern Virginia Urban League [Northern Virginia branch of the Washington Urban League; Northern Virginia Urban League, Alexandria, Virginia] and went to work for another organization about a couple of years or so but then I was invited to come back when the director of the league left and so I came back then as the, as the director, the executive director of the branch.
Speaker 1: That was like, there's a big gap now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You jumped from '79 [1979] to--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: So, so what did you do from '79 [1979] to--
Speaker 2: So, I went, I went to work for another nonprofit and still, and this was a nonprofit here in the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.] and, but it was probably for only about two years or so.  So it wasn't that much of a gap (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was this, what was this one, the one you worked for?
Speaker 2: So let me think of the name of the organization, the, the, the name will come to me in a minute but the work was very similar in terms of, this was a, it was a community based organization in Southeast, Southeast Washington [D.C.] and, and helping them to really kind of move the needle, if you will, around housing issues, around civil rights issues, so, so did that for about two years but, as I said, when the director of the Northern Virginia branch of the league left, I was invited, had the opportunity to come back and to direct the branch and I went through a number of interviews but at the end of the day, did get the job.  And so, was excited, you know, very excited about coming back.
Speaker 1: So what year is this?
Speaker 2: This would have been probably early '80s [1980s].  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah, maybe early to mid, mid-'80s [1980s] or so.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause I had you at, I guess as a director of the northern--
Speaker 2: Northern Virginia branch, yeah.
Speaker 1: --branch in 1990, yeah.  So--
Speaker 2: Well, no, so 1990, so now we are going to fast forward.  So 1990 was when the branch, tran- when we transitioned to branch to become a separate affiliate on its own.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: That was 19--yeah.
Speaker 1: So you went back there really in 1980?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the '80s [1980s], yeah, 19--from the '80s [1980s], I really served as the director of the branch.  In 1990 is when we kind of had the vision that it was time for the branch to become a separate affiliate.
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll just wait ten years.
Speaker 2: Okay, we'll, yeah, we'll, we'll wait the ten years.
Speaker 1: I just want to make sure, I want to make sure I wasn't, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --on the same, 'cause I know you did some other work--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --other than the Urban League--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and I didn't want to miss any of it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So in 1980, you're with the Northern Virginia--
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty [1980] really served as the director of the branch.  So the branch was, this was the director of Northern Virginia branch of the Greater Washington Urban League.  So, when we really fast forward, you'll see that my life has really kind of come full circle--that I'm now back at the Washington Urban League [Greater Washington Urban League, Washington, D.C.] but, yeah.
Story_ID: 648543
Speaker 1: Now this is, in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], the mayor is [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry, I think by then, right? Or?
Speaker 2: In D.C., yeah so, Marion Barry was the mayor by then, having followed Walter Washington, I think, so, so yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: First elected mayor, but yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Did you have much contact with Mayor Barry when you were in the city?
Speaker 2: Not then but an interesting story.  Two years ago, I was invited to speak at a, it was at an event that was being held in a church in South- Southwest Washington [D.C.] and it was around teen violence.  And so the deputy police chief was one of the speakers, the chancellor for the school system [District of Columbia Public Schools] here was one of the speakers, I was on the panel as, to be one of the speakers, a couple of other folks who I don't recall.  So when I got there that night, I noticed, you know, the seat that they put me, had me to sit at, the seat right adjacent to me was empty.  And so about maybe fifteen, twenty minutes or so into the meeting, Marion Barry comes in and, Mayor Marion Barry comes in and he takes the seat.  I had no idea that he was going to be on the panel.  So I introduce myself to him.  I said, well, "Mr. Mayor, my name is George Lambert [HistoryMaker George H. Lambert] and I'm the new president and CEO of the Greater Washington Urban League [Washington, D.C.]," and he said, "Ah, okay, good to meet you."  And so, then when the moderator asked me to get up and to come to the podium to speak, she said, "Well before you, we start talking about the issue, why don't you give us a little bit about your background."  So I shared in my background that, you know, I was a native Washingtonian and that a part of my early life in the District of Columbia I grew up in Barry Farms [Barry Farm, Washington, D.C.].  And so when I came back to sit down, because Barry Farms is very important to Marion Barry.  So when I came back to sit down, he said, "You know," put his hand, he said, "it's really good to meet you," and he said, "In fact, what I want to do is you and I to sit down, I'm going to have my office to circle back with you so that you and I can really have an opportunity to have some dialogue and to talk."  So that really resonated with him, okay, not so much that I was a new president of the Greater Washington Urban League but the fact that I had lived in Barry Farms.  He was a very strong advocate for Barry Farms and, you know, always a very strong advocate for the issues of the people and particularly in a low income people.  So that really resonated with him.  The unfortunate thing was that the day that I was supposed to go back to meet with him, his office called me and said, "Mr. Lambert," and he was a Councilman Barry then, he said, you know, "he wanted to really spend a good, maybe hour or so with you and he's been involved in a number of hearings today and he's only going to have about a fifteen to ten minute break and he wants to really give you more time than that so we're going to reschedule," and I was like, "Well fine, you know, okay, we'll do that."  We never got it rescheduled before he passed; and so I always really kind of felt that was a loss because I was really looking forward to it, so, so yeah.
Story_ID: 648544
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were talking off camera about how beloved Marion, [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry was in the city [Washington, D.C.] despite some of his foibles, you know, his impulses as such and so many people we've interviewed have mentioned him and talked about, you know, working with him and some even had to work against him on some level, politically, but they still admired, his work--
Speaker 2: Every- everybody loved him.  His name is still revered here in the city at this point and, and I think any, anybody who is a student of, of social action and, what do we call it, public disobedience to some extent, he was really the person to learn from, you know.  He, he was just, he will always be revered here in the city, you know, his love of the community and really his love of people in terms of making a difference in their life, so yeah.
Story_ID: 648545
Speaker 1: As you come back to northern Virginia as a director now, what was your, what were your priorities, I guess?
Speaker 2: Well, so this was director of the Northern Virginia branch of the Washington Urban League [Northern Virginia Urban League, Alexandria, Virginia].  I mean, so we, you know, we sort of administered a number of, of programs, you know, in the city.  Our footprint was Alexandria [Virginia], Fairfax County [Virginia] and Arlington [Virginia].  So we were very much engaged in youth programming.  We did a lot on the housing front but probably more than anything else, we're very much engaged in advocacy.  I remember, I convened a group and it was called the, the Alexandria Black Forum [ph.].  Later on, over time, we dropped the name black forum and just began to call it the Alexandria Forum but it was really a convening of, of all of the key organizations, the civil rights organizations.  I never, I thought it was wise and politically correct to never really kind of say that I was the chair of anything, it was just the convening of it that all of these organizations and these leaders, we came together and, and we did it at the Urban League and talked about strategy around a number of the issues that we were all confronting, maybe the strategy was, you know, very different in terms of how we were approaching it but thought it was very important and critical that we have a forum we could all kind of come together and, and discuss these issues and so we did that.  So, and, and as I said, you know, it was just, we convened it at the Urban League, so yeah.
Speaker 1: Who was the head of the Greater Washington Urban League [Washington, D.C.] in those days?
Speaker 2: So, when I initially came into the Urban League movement, it was John Jacob [HistoryMaker John E. Jacob] and, you know, John went on to become president of the National Urban League, someone who's a mentor to me and someone who's still a very dear friend and a couple times a year, I get to see him and talk and sit with him and soak up his wisdom even to this day, so yeah.  So John Jacob, initially, and then after John left, a gentleman by the name of Jerome Page and then Betty Whaley, so all folks who I worked for, learned a lot from during the time that they were here and, and really mentored me, so yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were, so as you return there in 1980, how long were you there now, to this, at this juncture?
Speaker 2: So, from the, so, at least as the director of the branch for almost about maybe ten years or so, because then it was in 1990, as I said when we got the bright idea that we wanted to look at transitioning the branch to become a full affiliate of the, of the National Urban League movement.  And so it was, it meant that we had to raise a whole lot of money.  It meant that we had to get a whole lot of goodwill and support from companies, corporations to then present to the National Urban League for their consideration to bring us into the Urban League movement as one of the official Urban League affiliates.  And so at the time, when we came in, we were the 114th affiliate of the National Urban League.

Speaker 1: So in the decade from 1980 to 1990, you've got, basically, you know, Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan], George Bush [President George Herbert Walker Bush], you have Republicans in the White House?
Speaker 2: That's yeah, that's right, you're correct, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Locally, you saw, [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry's the mayor [of Washington, D.C.], basically, with, and the blip when he goes to jail in 1991--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --I guess, or so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, somewhere in there, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and he, you know, and he comes back, he's mayor again.
Speaker 2: He get--you're right, yeah, he did come back to serve as mayor again, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did, was there, in northern Virginia, were there any black mayors in the towns of northern Virginia in those days?
Speaker 2: No, never had a black mayor until, you know, I guess was with him in the past ten years when Bill Euille [William Euille] became the mayor of the City of Alexandria [Virginia] but, but not on my watch while I served as the executive director of the branch [Northern Virginia branch of the Washington Urban League] and, and during the period that I served as president of the affiliate [Northern Virginia Urban League, Alexandria, Virginia], I think, and again, my memory is even getting fuzzy now because all of these dates, but I think it was probably right after I left, or maybe right before I left, that Bill Euille became the mayor for the City of Alexandria.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So yeah.
Speaker 1: I think Rashad Young came in for a minute as city manager, too, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 648547
Speaker 1: So, are there any stories from this period of time?  I mean, from these ten years that--?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, so I will share one with you.  I had a great mentor when I served in Alexandria [Virginia] and for the Northern Virginia Urban League and so for the affiliate there and the person of a gentleman by the name of Ferdinand Day who is now deceased.  Ferdinand Day was the, also he was the first African American to become the chair of the board for the, for the school board there [Alexandria City School Board] and so he, he was really my mentor.  He, if you recall the movie, 'Remember the Titans,' and, and at some point in the movie, so Denzel Washington was the person who starred in the movie, but, but Herman Boone was the real coach.  And so Herman was a good friend, good buddy.  And so in the movie, you know, there was this whole discussion about the team, the football team not being able to go.  I can't remember where it was, but not being able to go to someplace to play a game or whatever.  And so Ferdinand Day, as the chair of the school board, said, well, you know, he would just cut some of the things out of the budget so that there would be resources and money for, for the team but it was that kind of boldness and, and leadership that Ferdinand Day really kind of brought.  And so, you know, at some point the, the system really decided to acquiesce, if you will, and supported him in terms of the team but, but Herman Boone is someone that I really admired and when he did the movie, 'Remember the Titans,' when he and Denzel did the movie, I was still serving there.  And so we decided that we were going to recognize Herman Boone at our annual gala, we were going to recognize him for his leadership.  And so I remember having lunch with Herman one day and I said to him, "You know, it would be great if we could get Denzel Washington to come and present the award to you." And he said to me, he says, "Well George [HistoryMaker George H. Lambert], send him a letter."  And so, so I did, you know, sent, sent Denzel Washington a letter and his people immediately got back with me, probably in a couple of weeks or so and said, "Unfortunately, Mr.," you know, "Mr. Washington is--has other commitments now and won't be able to come."  So I called Herman and said, "Herman, I did what you told me to do, you know, we sent Denzel Washington a letter and asked him to come and I'm told that, you know, we're told that he's not going to be able to come." And Herman is kind of very direct when he talks with you.  He said, "Okay, George, thank you, I'll take care of it."  I didn't quite understand what that meant.  So I'll never forget, maybe about a week or so later, my wife [Bernadette Curtis-Lambert] and I, we were coming in from church and it was Herman, he called, and so the phone was ringing as we were walking in the door and he said, and I said, hello, and so Herman said, "George, this is Herman Boone." And I knew who it was, he didn't have to tell me who, but I knew it was, "Herman Boone," and I said, "Hey, Herman, how you doing?"  He said, "Well listen, I'm calling to let you know that Denzel Washington is coming."  I said, "Herman, come on."  I said, "Now, it's Sunday, you know, I'm coming in from church," and I said, "You shouldn't be really kind of, you know, pulling--." He says, "George, I'm telling you he's coming."  I said, "Herman, you sure?"  He says, "George, I'm standing in the man's kitchen right now and he wanted me to call you.  He said, he wanted me to call Mr. Lambert and tell him he was coming."  So, lesson learned from that.  First of all, Denzel Washington, as he explained to Herman, as I understand, he never really saw my letter from him.  His people got it and, you know, they knew how busy he was and so his people just kind of made a decision for him that he would just not be able to do it but Denzel Washington thought so much of Herman Boone and the work that he had done in terms of the integrating of the football team [at T.C. Williams High School, Alexandria, Virginia], he really wanted to come to present the award to Herman Boone.  So, he did come at our gala to present the award to Herman Boone, so yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So when you ask me, you know, memorable experiences, that will be one I will never, ever forget, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, that's something.  So this would have been around the time the movie was out and--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was during the period that the movie was out, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: This is like in the mid-'90s [sic. 2000], I guess?
Speaker 2: Mid-'90s [1990s], yeah, yeah, mid-'90s [1990s] or so, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 648548
Speaker 1: Any other experiences from this--?
Speaker 2: Well, that was probably the most memorable, so, so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, so you were the head of the Northern--
Speaker 2: Northern Virginia Urban League [Alexandria, Virginia], yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah, when Governor Wilder [HistoryMaker L. Douglas Wilder] was the first black governor of the State of Virginia?
Speaker 2: Yeah, absolutely.  He, that was, that was on my watch and the governor did come to northern Virginia to speak on several occasions and, in fact, we invited him when he became governor to bring the keynote address at one of my galas as well, so, so yeah.  Very, very effective governor when he was in place; and recall doing a lot of work, you know, with his administration in terms of moving the legislation and really, you know, moving it, moving the needle, so to speak, but yeah.
Story_ID: 648549
Speaker 1: Now online there are quite a few articles that you've written for the Afro [Afro-American Newspapers], the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier], different papers.  Have you cons- have you done that consistently throughout your, your--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --as president, CEO one or the other, as branch--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I, I'm a strong believer in giving voice to the work that we do and that the Urban League [National Urban League], we should always, inasmuch as we are a community based social service organization, but we also are a very strong advocacy organization as well and I think, to some extent, maybe taking advantage, if you will, about bully pulpit to do that.  I've always thought it was very important that we be, you know, we certainly have a voice and we certainly, you know, whether it's through the print media or whether it's through the, you know, local press media in terms of radio or television that we do that.  So, yeah, so I used to, you know, write and, articles for the Alexandria Gazette. They would interview me on various issues.  Since I've been here now at the Greater Washington Urban League [Washington, D.C.] clearly for the, for the Afro, for the Washington Informer, Washington Post [The Washington Post], whenever we can get, you know, certainly a print there; but, yeah, I think that's important for us to do, so yeah.
Story_ID: 648550
Speaker 1: So now at, at some point, didn't you separate and go to the, I mean, move to the National Urban League as some sort of a--?
Speaker 2: So I did some, what I thought was some very interesting and critical work for the National Urban League.  I thought it was an opportunity for me to do it.  I really enjoyed it but it was part of the rollout.  So the national league put in place a, a piece of work called the performance assessment and most organizations, and particularly large social service organization, it is critical that you always really kind of have a pulse check on the work that we're doing in terms of our management, of what we do with regard to how we, the governance of the organizations, our fiscal responsibility, all those kind of things.  So the National Urban League rolled that out that it would do a performance assessment of all of the affiliates a couple times, well at least maybe every two to three years.  And so the initial rollout of that, I had the opportunity to work with the national league, having the oversight of the central region of the U.S., so it was probably about, I don't know, maybe twenty-five to thirty Urban League affiliates, in and out, I think maybe about so, eight to ten states in terms of doing that work.  I enjoyed doing it, was excited, as I said to be a part of the team that went out in the field to do the assessment of the various Urban League affiliates.  So not only doing the performance assessment piece but also having the opportunity to be very much a part of board leadership training; and then from time to time, even doing some troubleshooting as well and that was always interesting, so.
Story_ID: 648551
Speaker 1: For, now, in terms of national leadership around--do, do you, I don't want to--back in the civil rights days, a lot of the local groups would get a charge of usually bringing the national president or something to speak, you know.  Do you have to use that kind of power judiciously, you know, when you're in the Urban League, I don't know?  You weren't, I don't know, I guess you were probably still just a staff member when Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] was president of the National Urban League, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I was.  And so I really did not know Vernon Jordan at that stage of my career in the Urban League movement.  Interestingly enough, fast forwarding to, since I've been here as president, excuse me, of the Greater Washington Urban League [Washington, D.C.], I do now have a very good relationship with Mr. Jordan.  I call him Mr. Jordan.  Not long after I became the president of the Greater Washington Urban League, one of my board members who I've always had a very longstanding relationship with him, we were just talking one day and I said, "You know, I, I know of Mr. Jordan, I've never really had an opportunity to sit with him or meet, or met him or anything, and I would love to be able to do that." And she said, "Well look, no problem, you know.  Let me just set up a meeting with Vernon."  And so, so my first meeting with Mr. Jordan he said, you know, "Welcome," and met in his office and he said, "I've heard a lot about you and, you know, really want to help and support you." And so he was very gracious, spent about an hour or so with us that day and, and just said to me that, "You know, well, so what I'm going to do is maybe a couple of times a year, you and I, we will sit." And he has really kind of stuck to that, a couple of times a year and, you know, he, he really works out of New York [New York] but he's here in, in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], I think on Fridays or whatever.  And so, so he's done that and it's been, it's been very insightful for me, you know, just really kind of soaking up his wisdom.  We talk about a number of things or whatever but he's always very gracious with his time in terms of doing that.  So, it's been, in these last formative, you know, years, maybe three years or so that I've had the opportunity to develop the, the relationship with Mr. Jordan.
Story_ID: 648552
Speaker 1: What about the other past presidents like [HistoryMaker] Hugh Price or John Jacob [HistoryMaker John E. Jacob] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Hugh Price, absolutely and I see Hugh Price a couple of times a year.  In fact, I said to Hugh Price a few months ago when I saw him that I was going to invite him to come in and to kind of do a piece with our staff here [Greater Washington Urban League, Washington, D.C.].  We do staff development and even in our staff meetings, I do, you know, leadership, development as well.  And so, I've asked Hugh Price to do it so he will come.  We did that with John Jacob probably, I don't know, maybe three or four months or so ago.  John was very gracious, probably spent that day about maybe three hours or so with the staff and just kind of talking about his legacy, the legacy of the Urban League movement.  You know, we have so many folks now that are young and to the Urban League movement and to the Civil Rights Movement.  So anytime that I, you know, can get one of the (unclear), so to speak, and one of our, you know, leaders to come and talk about the legacy of the movement, I consider it a real opportunity for our staff and, and, you know, for them to come and share.  So, eventually, I want to have, you know, all of our former presidents to come but, as I said, John Jacob's been, Hugh Price will come and then we will get Mr. Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.].  I've done the one on ones with Mr. Jordan, but I want to have him to come to do it with the full staff as well.
Story_ID: 648553
Speaker 1: So did, did you ever leave Northern Virginia [Northern Virginia Urban League, Alexandria, Virginia] to work for the national as such? Or the?
Speaker 2: I did.  I consult with the National Urban League- Okay.
Speaker 1: --for about two years, so, so yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I did. But I also, I took a bit of a hiatus, if you will, and so for a couple of years I left the, the Urban League movement and so I left and then I went to work for a public affairs firm and, and I learned a whole lot there, really did, but I also--
Speaker 2: What year is this?
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: About what year is this?
Speaker 1: It would have been in the early 2000--maybe early to mid-2000s, yeah, somewhere in there, but inasmuch as I learned a whole lot, they also, the other thing that I had to reconcile and I did come to grips with as well, is that my passion was really with the Urban League movement and eventually I did come back to the Urban League movement because that was my passion.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, okay, so you were gone for a couple of years total?
Speaker 1: A couple of years, yeah, yeah, a couple of--
Speaker 2: Two thousand two [2002], sound right?  Does that sound right?
Speaker 1: Maybe, no, I, maybe it's a little bit later than that, so maybe 2003 or so to about '05 [2005], somewhere in there.  So, as I said, you know, for the public affairs firm, even did a tour of duty, a brief tour of duty with United Way [United Way of America; United Way Worldwide]; but eventually, you know, it is my passion, so I did come back to the Urban League movement.
Story_ID: 648554
Speaker 1: So would that be in 2011 when you came back?
Speaker 2: Probably, yeah, probably around that time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that's when you came back and you were the president and CEO of the Lorain County--
Speaker 2: Lorain County Urban League [Elyria, Ohio], yeah.
Speaker 1: Now this is in Ohio near Lake Erie, near Cleveland [Ohio]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the suburb of Cleveland--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Lorain, Ohio is the hometown of Toni Morrison, the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --great novelist.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's true.
Speaker 1: And what was that like?  What was Lorain like?
Speaker 2: Well, a good Urban League affiliate [National Urban League] that was there, it still is there, quite frankly, and so I was asked to come to help them to, to navigate and to do some work in terms of, really kind of help catapulting that affiliate, if you will, to the next level.  And so it was work that I knew I could do and I knew it wasn't necessarily going to take me a lifetime to do it.  So there was a set clock in my mind, if you will, in terms of how long it would take to do and so it was pretty much on the mark.  I, I thought about maybe a year and a half to two years and I actually ended up being there for about twenty-five months or so.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you--
Speaker 2: And so, at the end of the twenty-five, so my work was done and that's, for me, that's a good feeling, you know, that what I've come to do, I've accomplished what I needed to do and so my work was done.  And so when my work was done at the end of the twenty-five months, I left but, but so when you've asked earlier, from time to time about interesting experiences and all of that, the most interesting thing for me there was, of course, the weather and I, you know, I share with folks from time to time that in a given day, you could have about four or five different weather experiences.  You could have sunshine in the morning, you could have rain, you could have hail, you could have snow, all in one day.  I, you know, growing up in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and Pennsylvania, whatever, I never really experienced that.  So the weather was very, was very enlightening, very interesting to me, then really being right there on Lake Erie so when you got the snow it was like the lake effect snow as well.  It was very interesting to me.  The cold, the wind, very interesting to me.  I had a wardrobe there, quite frankly, that it was strictly for Pennsylvania.  So, and then, some of the clothes that I still had back here at home, never really made it to Pennsylvania, I mean, to Ohio because it just did not make sense in terms of the cold there, so, so yeah, but I enjoyed the people, I enjoyed the work that I did for the Urban League there. I think it was very meaningful work and I felt very honored that I was asked to come and to help that particular Urban League affiliate.
Speaker 1: Now were you just now, I can't help but thinking that you were kind of there just kind of marking time.  Had the Urban League promised you another spot?  I mean, when you were there--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --did you think you were going to be in--Lorain is small by, you know.
Speaker 2: Lorain is small but I think big.  And so while it was, Lorain is small and while it was a small Urban League affiliate, the opportunities around Lorain, I thought, you know, because I kind of did my due diligence in terms of taking a look at it so I thought there was tremendous opportunity but I was very clear in terms of the work that I wanted to do and the work that the, you know, that the board had asked me to do there.  And so, you know, even if I had end up staying, I would have really kind of advanced and taken that work and even the footprint to, to another level as well.
Story_ID: 648555
Speaker 1: So you were there from 2011 to 2013; and you said you accomplished your objectives and kind of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) got them back into working order.
Speaker 2: My coming, 'cause so, from Lorain [Lorain County Urban League, Elyria, Ohio], I did come to the Greater Washington Urban League [Washington, D.C.] but initially that was really not in the game plan because my predecessor here and a lady who I really considered a mentor, who I, you know, continue to revere as well, [HistoryMaker] Maudine Cooper, had served here as the president of the Greater Washington Urban League for a number of years and I had no idea that, you know, she was really considering retiring.  And so even when she announced her retirement, yup, you know there were some folks who reached out to me and said, you know, "George [HistoryMaker George H. Lambert], Maudine is retiring, you ought to consider, you know, throwing your hat in the ring for the, for the Greater Washington Urban League." I was like, "No."  You know, part of it with me was that I just, to some extent thought that everybody who thought they had arrived, so to speak, were going to be in the hunt to become the president of the Greater Washington Urban League.  It had nothing to do with my skillset but just kind of felt, everybody who arrived, that's where they were going to be and I just really didn't want to travel in that.  And so to kind of show you how, because also kind of maintain, it was the Lord's hand in this as well.  It was the last day of the cutoff time to submit your resume that I finally made a decision that I would submit my resume for the position, the last day, okay.  And, and so, the last day and then, you know, six months or so later, because there was a number of rounds of interviews, or whatever that I went through, I actually went through six rounds of interviews, to then emerge and to actually become the president, you know, of the Greater Washington Urban League but initially, this wasn't my focus.  I wasn't really looking, that I was even going to throw my hat in the ring.  So, so I just, you know, I just kind of now step back and look at it and just know that there was, it was, you know, the intervention of the Lord's hand in it.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, now so, were there, were there a lot of candidates?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean the, at the end of the day, some board members here shared with me, there were quite a few candidates, you know, and so, so yeah, yeah, but that, that, you know, for an affiliate of this size and for the work that this particular organization is involved in doing and for the, the notoriety that Maudine Cooper really kind of brought to the Greater Washington Urban League, that would be expected.  I would have expected no less, really.  That would have been a, that there would have been a number of candidates that would have had an interest in, in throwing their hat in the ring for, to become the president of the Greater Washington Urban League.
Story_ID: 648556
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so the Greater Washington Urban League [Washington, D.C.], you, you succeeded [HistoryMaker] Maudine Cooper in 2014.  Now as you come in the office, people, black organizations all over the country are concerned with Black Lives Matter.  I know you wrote about it.  Was there a specific role the Urban League played in the Black Lives Matter movement or in the, I mean, the national attention to all these young black men being shot in various cities?
Speaker 2: Black Lives Matter and a number of other organizations, I think, have all really worked together in responding to the concern around the killing and the shooting of African Americans and the thing about that, you know, I, I've certainly come to, I've come to learn and respect about all of our organizations is that while our strategy may be a little bit different but at the end of the day our interest is still the same, okay, and, and we just, you know, we, we target it and we do it in a different way but I do think it's important that we try to work together to make sure that we continue to move forward in terms of our agenda.  And so I think the Black Lives Matter, they have certainly raised some very serious issues, issues that, as I say, you know, we're concerned about, we respond to and, yeah, we, you know, we've certainly worked with them in terms of responding to many of those issues as well.  So you're right, I've certainly worked--written about the shootings and so, yeah.
Story_ID: 648557
Speaker 1: Is there a specific, I guess, agency or, or entity, police department or, I mean, that the Urban League engages in, in you know, in regards to this?
Speaker 2: So, one of the things, so when you mention police department, the former police chief who was here [Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia] and so, you know, she's left now and went to head up the, I guess it was the NFL [National Football League], the league or whatever as, for security, for the NFL league, I decided, and I just blocked on her name, but anyway, but I decided that we would recognize her at one of our galas, as one of our honorees because I also maintain that when you have a police chief that really kind of gets it in terms of how to engage with communities of color, that we should embrace that and while to some, Cathy Lanier, I'm sorry, was the police chief's name, Chief Lanier, and, you know, my sense was, Chief Cathy Lanier really kind of got it in terms of how to engage with communities of color.  And so, again, when you have a police chief that has a good sense of how to engage with communities of color, I think it's important that we, we certainly, we embrace it.  Now, when I went to my board and said that, you know, I think that one of the honorees we should have at our gala should be Chief Cathy Lanier, I also recognize that there were probably few, if any, quote unquote civil rights leaders in the country that were talking about recognizing police chiefs, okay.  And so, yep, that was daring in a way and probably put us in the spotlight in a very interesting way as well but, again, I think it's important when we have police chiefs that will step out there that we do that, that we certainly embrace and that we certainly recognize.  So she was very honored and I think it was the right thing for the, for the Greater Washington Urban League [Washington, D.C.] to do but, as I said, I'm still trying to find now when we did that whether or not there were any other civil rights leaders that were recognizing police chiefs, not that they were, not that there were some that were deserving but it was just daring to do.  You know, when we had all of these shootings and police departments really under the microscope and being questioned about the aggressiveness in terms of how they were policing communities of color, so, so yeah.
Story_ID: 648558
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know communities in other cities have organized over the years, like Lee, [HistoryMaker] Lee P. Brown--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and Chuck Ramsey [Charles Ramsey], who used to be here, as well, but, so there are people that recognize that, I mean, do the community organizations here like push for, like a community police stra- strategy and, or push to maintain that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, some of the things we've done, we have a, we have an auxiliary group here called the Thursday Network, they're really our young professionals.  And so, this, this Urban League affiliate [Greater Washington Urban League, Washington, D.C.], along with our Thursday Network, we've kind of developed a paper, if you will, around how young African Americans and teenagers, as well, and particularly black males, young black males, should conduct themselves when, when engaged with a member of the police department.  And so, because we think it's very important, you know, to message and that these are some of the things you should do but here's some of the things that you should not do as well, okay.  And so we've, probably I don't know, about maybe twenty bullets or points or whatever, so we developed that.  We distributed, make sure that when we work with various community groups and particularly and over the, you know, the youth organizations, that's information that we pass along, so--
Speaker 1: Now is it a, what form are the tickets, like?  Palm card or is it a, what is it?
Speaker 2: Well, palm cards are probably a good idea.  You know, we didn't really do it in a palm card.  We probably did it, it's more in a, more in a, probably like a leaflet or whatever.  And so, and then we put it on, you know, put it on the website, you know, as well, so things like that, so yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know in Chicago [Illinois] they had it as a card, I mean, they had a form of that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: A card with a number of a lawyer, too (laughter), on it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, the, you know, pro bono lawyers--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --who are going to organize themselves to respond.
Story_ID: 648559
Speaker 1: Now you've got to form partnerships with corporations and I know you have a number of, of different projects.  You've worked with the Washington Nationals and the--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --baseball team and, I'm sorry, I suppose the Wizards [Washington Wizards], too, I don't know.  I couldn't find anything about this--
Speaker 2: Not as, not as much with the Wizards--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but really with the, with the Washington--here--you know, we've had some very, I think, unique partnerships, very special partnerships.  The Nationals has been one and the Nationals really, I kind of got engaged with them immediately when coming on board and it was my chairman who said to me that the Nationals are really trying to reach out to engage the African American community in the game of baseball.  If you think historically, the African American community, at one point, was really engaged in the game of baseball and over time and because of cost and all of that, not as engaged anymore.  And so, when you, and someone from the Nationals said to me, kind of when you go to the stadium [Nationals Park, Washington, D.C.] and you kind of look out, the stadium is filled but what you don't see are African American faces there.  And so, thought the Urban League [Greater Washington Urban League, Washington, D.C.] might be a organization that could really kind of help them to address the commitment that they had in terms of really wanting to get African Americans engaged in the game of baseball.  So we set about, you know, working with them to do that, to do that work.  In fact, they, we, they, we put in place what is called African American Heritage Day [Black Heritage Day].  And so they set aside a day but it's really at one of the games where we have, we do a strong outreach to the African American community to come out to be a part of that game.  The Nationals, what they do is celebrate the Urban League at the game.  We're up on the billboard and all of that.  We use it as an opportunity to recognize many of the, you know, folks that we serve in our community as well.  There's some fundraising that happens for us around it as well.  And so I just think it's a, it's a great partnership.  The other thing that they do with us is during the Christmas holiday season, they do what is called the National fest [Nationals Winterfest] and so they invite the fans to bring a gift to an event that they do at the, at the convention center [Walter E. Washington Convention Center, Washington, D.C.] and then it's a Christmas gift actually for a kid and then all of those gifts that they collect they pass them on to the, to the Urban League for us to distribute those gifts to needy families and needy children in the community.  I think the first year that we did it with them probably close to about two thousand or so, you know, items and toys or whatever that we collected for kids.  So, not only toys but, you know, educational kinds of, of items as well.  So, you know, we are, we've been happy to do that.  We've been happy that, and in partnership with the Nationals that during the holiday season that we're able to bless families, if you will, with gifts.  And so many of the families we have they come here, they pick up the bags of, you know, gifts or whatever, and then there've been so many that we also share many of those bags and gifts with other community based organizations so that they can give to the clientele that they've served as well.  So, it's been on the strength of that.  It's really been a, a great partnership with an organization that really has a commitment in terms of its community responsibility.

Speaker 1: And, and there are others, you know; I mean, PEPCO [Potomac Electric Power Company], for example, that's you know, here in the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.], they've been a great partner.  Through their, you know, we, they support in terms of utility assistance for folks who have their utilities turned off, you know, throughout the season or whatever, so they give dollars and those dollars to us so that we can administer those dollars and provide those dollars to families so that, you know, their utilities can be turned back on.  Of course we do some, you know, some mentoring, some counseling around that, you know, so just, so that they're not consistently in that situation again year over year as well.  So many, many great partners in terms of corporate partners and that, that we, you know, really have worked with.
Speaker 2: Is PEPCO like the major partner, I guess?
Speaker 1: PEPCO is the major utility here in, in the District of Columbia but if, the partners at the Greater Washington Urban League [Washington, D.C.] had, it's a long list.  And so I could spend this full interview just talking about all of the partners and the great work that we've done in terms of those partnerships as well but that's a, that's a very long list.
Speaker 2: I know it's been said that the Urban League, the Greater Washington, supplies direct services to sixty-five thousand people.
Speaker 1: Yeah, both, so that's direct and indirect services, direct and indirect services.  I mean, we have a radio station here and so we air on Sunday mornings and, you know, we know that our listening audience, for sure, is about sixty-five plus thousand that, you know, that broadcast goes out to every week.  And so, it could--
Speaker 2: So is it the Urban League's radio?
Speaker 1: It's, it's our radio station.  In part, so in partner--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) so it's a, it's Urban League's radio station in partnership with WPGC 95.5 [WPGC Radio, Washington, D.C.] and this has been a longstanding partnership that we've had with WPGC, as well.  So, so we air, you know, as I said, on, you know, on the air, when they broadcast but, and so we talk about a number of issues.  We invite, you know, some of our partners from time to time to come in to, to be interviewed, to be a part of the broadcast.  Sometimes I'm on.  I know in the past election we did a, did a couple of shows around voting and making sure that folks come out to vote, the importance of voting.  I remember talking a lot about, you know, when we don't vote, we dishonor our ancestors, okay.  I mean, for me that's just the bottom line.  We don't vote, we dishonor our ancestors.  So, talking about the sacrifices so many of, you know, our ancestors to show that we stand on now and for us not to show up on election day, we dishonor.  So, so yeah.  So topics like that, you know, which I think are very important.
Speaker 2: Well I read that the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's how we try to use that radio station.
Speaker 2: I've read that the voter turnout in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] was, was high, I mean this last national election (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The voting turnout--yeah, the voting turnout in D.C. was high, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1: Now you have, now you're on a number of boards and, and commissions, right?
Speaker 2: Not so many boards, you know, so now that I'm here at the, the Greater Washington Urban League [Washington, D.C.] and I, my responsibilities here are tremendous, so, so I have to, you know, I try to really be a big guardian in terms of things that I'm involved in and my commitments to, you know, various boards and organizations but, so I don't serve on as many boards anymore but still involved with, you know, other organizations as well, so still try to do that for sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you engage in trying to link youth with the jobs and scholarships, interns?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, we give a number of scholarships every year at our annual gala and that's really through our partnerships.  We have corporations as well.  So, I am told, and the Urban League here has been doing this for over twenty some years at this point, I am told that we probably have touched over seven thousand or so students, you know, in terms of the scholarships that we've given, several million dollars that that has been as well, so yeah.
Speaker 1: Has the, what's the state of giving these days of philanthropy?  I know the Urban League has to go to corporations and, and institutions to try to, you know, get the resources.  So, what's the state that they, as it was, you know, compared to what it used to be?
Speaker 2: So, my, my, clearly part of my role and responsibility is, is certainly raising money for the organization, positioning the organization that we are in a, in a posture that we're always worthy of, of corporations and individuals really wanting to support us in terms of the work that we do.  I would also dare say, and some of the writings and articles and news clips that I read now, strongly support, that given the political climate at this point, the sensitivity and the height of giving has really kind of spiked up.  And so, particularly the giving to, to nonprofit and to civil rights organizations.  So I think we're certainly benefiting from some of that, you know, as well but, but it is, but we always have to continue to position ourselves as an organization that folks will want to give to and support and there are a number of reasons, you know, for the, what we do in the way of the scholarships for, work that we do around housing, for, you know, for the work that we do in workforce development, so forth; you know, all of those things, just individual giving as well, so, so yeah.
Story_ID: 648562
Speaker 1: Do you plan to retire from, from this position here at the Greater Washington Urban League [Washington, D.C.] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I, I, I'm looking forward at some point to retiring.  I'm not quite ready to do it yet but I certainly do look forward to retiring but, you know, here's the thing with me in terms of retirement.  I will never, ever be someone that will retire and just go sit on the couch. That's not me.  Even at whatever point I retire, I know that I will always be engaged in doing something and something probably very similar to the work that I'm doing now but just probably more so in a volunteer capacity.  So, the retirement in terms of just, yep, going to go home, you know, sit on the couch, I mean I'm a, I, I love golf and so I say I'm a hacker but I love the game.  So, retirement just that I'm, you know, have an opportunity to be on the golf course every day, no, that won't be me.  I'll still be engaged in doing something, as I said, probably on a volunteer basis, but something in terms of having an impact, as I say, at another level as well.
Story_ID: 648563
Speaker 1: Okay, let me ask you about this.  Urban League's been around over a hundred years now, what are the state of--or what's the state of race relations in the United States, I know, today?  I mean, many people thought we were in a post-racial era in 2008 and some people think that we are going back to the days of the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] today, so, what's the reality?
Speaker 2: I think the reality today is a wakeup call, to be perfectly honest, I really think it's a wakeup call.  You know, I mean, you look back at the presidency of [HistoryMaker] President Barak Obama, while, and so first of all, I feel very blessed to have lived through the period of history when we had the first African American president but I also, in retrospect kind of look at it that while clearly he was, you know, I think he did a great job as a president.  In fact, by the way, the Urban League has just, the national league, has just done a report card on his presidency so it really kind of delineates all of the things that he really did as, as a president and you can see that he was very, very effective as a president but when you also kind of look back on it, I, I think, as well that, many folks in the country, black and white, but more so, you know, really got caught up in the hype, to some extent, of electing the first black president.  So, yep, while we did go there but I also believe that, all right, we'll start that again.  Ask me, yeah--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA INTERUPTION)
Speaker 2: It's okay, you can pick up from--
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think that President Barak Obama really did a great job as, as a president.  In fact, the National Urban League has just done a report card on his presidency but I also believe that, you know, to some extent, many persons really got kind of caught up in the hype of electing the first black president.  In fact, I'm, I feel very blessed to have lived during the period in our history when we did elect a black, the first black president but in retrospect I kind of look at it.  When you really kind of think back on the way that he was treated as a president and it clearly kind of says to me, while we elected the first black president, we were not ready as a country in terms of having the first black president.  So really kind of straight to your question of race, we were not ready.  Never in my lifetime had I observed a disrespect of a president regardless of how much you disagree with his politics and not that I've ever seen that happen with President Barack Obama.  Even if you recall in one of his State of the Union Addresses, when a congressman [Joe Wilson] got up on the floor, okay, and disrespected the president, the way that he did, never in my lifetime ever have seen that and there are, you know, a number of incidences when you really kind of unpack and put it back where you see that.  So it really says to me that, yeah, we elected him but as a country we were not ready, we were not ready.  So, so that's a very sad commentary, that it really is a very sad commentary.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the rejection of Barak Obama seemed to be, you know, to many people, I mean, you could see, I mean, a lot of it was, seemed to be just based on race--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, regardless of his policies.  I think the, Mitch McConnell and some others announced, you know, after he was inaugurated, they're going to block everything he tries to do.  Now that doesn't seem to be, I mean, we know that there's a, you know, split between Democrats and Republicans in this country, left wing, right wing, but I've never heard anybody say that they block everything he tries to do, no matter what it is, you know.  So, it's interesting.  Well, so we've, we've had eight years of Obama's presidency and Urban League has a report card, it's a good thing.  Many people, I don't think people understand, you know, what actually was accomplished in that period in the, some kind of organized fashion you know because it's been an emotional, you know, ride for a lot of people.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: So, yeah.
Story_ID: 648564
Speaker 1: I think you, you likened the race relations in this country in an article to an unstable marriage.
Speaker 2: I did.  Yeah, I did.  Unstable marriage, you know, maybe another metaphor for it is, you know, the, you know, a dance and a tango or whatever and, you know, if you dance and you tango, the important thing about it is that you unlock stuff in terms of doing it together and, you know, the, the irony, the tragedy of all of this is, as I alluded to earlier, when you kind of pick up some of the literature and the writings of, you know, maybe some about earlier civil rights leaders and you just turn any page in the book and you would think about we're still talking about, you know, today.  I mean, we are still talking about today, it's not really yesterday, we're still here today.  So, we still have so many issues that this really separate us, you know, as a country, as a race and it's just, you know, I just really think it's a very sad commentary in terms of where we are.  I, I heard someone and so I think this is an interesting metaphor as well.  So, I'm an African American and let's say if you were a white gentleman sitting here talking with me and, and so from your perspective, you know, as someone white sitting here talking with me, and so I would ask you, "Well, what, what is, what's wrong on your end?"  And so, you would, your retort to me would be, "Well, we want what we had."  Me, as an African American, I would say to you, "Well, we want what you've got." Okay.  So, what is the common interest there?  Both really wanting something, all right.  Both really kind of wanting something and both clearly seeing that, you know, we need to get to what it is that we want to really be able to get there.  Race is not so much the issue but really both are kind of, you know, putting it in a context of race, all right.  So, it's been, it's been a struggle for, for both communities, you know, with regard to how we really get there.  It's not so much the race around it, it's that we both have common interests and it's just really kind of figuring out how we get there, how we address those things and moving race aside as the issue with regard to how we do it.  So, it's, as I said earlier, we are in a place now where we, we just, you know, we still have not taken down the barriers in terms of many of the issues that separate us around race; and I think we just, we have to get there, we have to get there.
Story_ID: 648565
Speaker 1: We always ask this question: what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: You know, for, for young persons, I think education is really very key because education probably more than anything else, I think, can change the circumstances in terms of where you are and to where you can go to.  And so I'm a strong advocate, strong believer with regard to, to educating and education and showing that, you know, we take down any barriers with regard to our kids getting an education.  So we will always continue, you know, to push that lever and, and just, you know, that's important for it to happen.  It's whether you do it at an HBCU [historically black colleges and universities] or whether, you know, you go to a school that's not an HBCU, still with the pushing and encouraging education and particularly with African American males, so, so yeah.
Story_ID: 648566
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point in your life, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Well, all of us, I think, if we had an opportunity to do it over again, there would be some things that we would do differently.  There's this cliche that, what does--how does it go?  The life is kind of wasted on youth, on the youth, or something like that and I understand it.  I think you understand what I'm saying on that because, yeah, we clearly kind of look back in terms of how we do it, we would do it differently.  So, yeah, there would be some things probably I would do differently.  I mean, I'm not thinking of anyone right now but clearly, yeah.  I, you know, I really try to be methodical in terms of how I approach, how I address things, or whatever, and, and so sometimes you have to rethink well, you know, whether you spent too much time really overthinking something and then, you know, sometimes you think, well, yep, if I had to do it again, clearly I would have approached that in a very different way.  And so, so I mean, yeah, I, yeah, there were some things I would look at how I would do again.
Story_ID: 648567
Speaker 1: What today are you the most proud of, I guess?
Speaker 2: My family, you know, and my kids, well, so, they're young adults 'cause they tell me now I can't call them kids, they're still kids but they are, they're young adults, all of whom I'm really very proud of.  I have, I have five kids and six grand- grandchildren and with all of them, just really very proud of what they have done, what they have accomplished in their life, where they are, you know, more importantly, where they're headed and, and, and their commitment to, to still giving back as well.  The fact that they still reach out to me, the old guy, so to speak, sometimes for the wisdom, whatever, you know, whatever that is, but, but I'm really very, very proud of them.  The work that they have allowed me to be involved in, and particularly with my wife [Bernadette Curtis-Lambert], you know, the work that she's allowed me to be involved in.  From time to time I've been able to kid and say that my wife has allowed me to have a mistress in my life and the mistress of my life has been the Urban League movement [National Urban League].  So, but, yeah, so, but those are the things that I'm really very proud of.
Speaker 1: Now you and your wife have a consulting business [Curtis Lambert International], don't you?
Speaker 2: I, so, my wife, she still has a business, I'm not, I'm not a part of, you know, the business but, but yeah, my, my wife.  My wife is really the, my wife, so I'm--the, the joke is, I'm the civil rights, and I'm the community, community worker in the family; and she's the, she's the real entrepreneur in the family.  And so, so that works for us, you know, so that's, so that really does work for us.
Story_ID: 648568
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything we haven't discussed that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I think we're good.
Speaker 1: Okay, well the last question is similar to the previous one but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: In the, in the Urban League movement and in the work that I've done, is certainly being remembered in terms of having made an impact at another level and really making a difference.  That's why I said to you earlier that during the time that I left the Urban League movement and went to, you know, that bit of a hiatus and went to work for a for profit, excuse me, a for profit and a public affairs company, really kind of recognize that it wasn't my passion, although I learned a whole lot, but it wasn't my passion.  My passion is really back on this end in terms of the giving and in terms of making a difference in the lives of others.  It's not an easy work, okay, it's not an easy work.  In fact, one of the things that I, I do and, and when I do it I'm told many times from folks that it's unique, it's different.  When we have persons that come to work for the Urban League and so at the end of the day, I'm kind of the last person that they have to get the blessings from, so they do have to come and sit with me to go through, you know, kind of the final interview or whatever my sign off or whatever I want it.  And so, I start out by sharing with them, which is true, 'cause you've heard this earlier that, I say, you know, let me tell you something.  So both my parents [Arnitha Green Allen and George H. Lambert, Sr.] were Baptist ministers and so I learned very early in my household that you just don't wake up one morning on a whim and decide that you're going to go preach the gospel. You are called to preach the gospel, okay.  And so for me it's very important that folks who come to work for the Urban League, they are called to do this work. That's the straight up bottom line from me. You are called to do this work.  And so before I can get to your skillsets and your tools and, you know, all of the, all of the gifts that you have that you think you can really bring to the Urban League movement, I need to know that you're called to do this work because I really think, quite frankly, that people that we have served, they deserve to have people who are doing this work who are called to do this work.  So for me, working in an organization and having people who work with me and support me, that they are called to do this work and that's how, I think, that, you know, my legacy in terms of making a difference with regard to the work that we do and making an impact at another level.  That's what I want to be remembered for.  I want to be remembered for that, I want to be remembered for working with people who are called to do this work not with people who just, you know, want to, to be here, to do a job--that's how I want to be remembered.
Speaker 1: You couldn't be more right.  Thank you.
