 Neurohr Today is October 22, 2015. My name is Karen Neurohr. I   m interviewing  Sarah Gonzales for the O-STATE Stories Oral History Interview Project.  Let   s start by talking about last night. Last night we had a program in the  library, which was titled Our Stories, Our Identity, and it was sponsored in  part by a grant from the Oklahoma Humanities Council whose mission is, I  quote,    to promote meaningful public engagement through humanities  disciplines such as history, literature, film studies, ethics and philosophy.  The humanities offer a deeper understanding of ourselves and others by  confronting us with questions, values, and meanings of human experience.  The program was designed to help everyone explore his or her own heritage  through small and large group dialogue, spoken word poetry, with space  provided for reflection and writing.    We had fifty-seven people at the  program last night. Tell me what your impression of how the program went  was.  Gonzales I thought it was really good. (Laughs) I texted my  partner  after, and I said,     Smash     That   s what we say when it was like,    That   s exactly how I  wanted it to go.    Yeah, I like that everybody participated and the things they  wrote, that they shared a line from it, and even just the line, you could tell  there was a lot more behind it and just everyone listening and being   impacted  because when you just see someone   s face, you have all these  ideas that you   ve already made about them. Then when you can hear from  their own voice, a piece of their poetry, and you know you had a shared  experience about where you   re from. You want to know more. Now when  they see each other or just an idea to take away of like,    Everybody   s  walking around carrying a multitude of stories with them.    I thought it was  really great. I appreciated the way they participated.  Neurohr I noticed that several students who came went and visited with you after the  program.  Gonzales Yes.  5  Neurohr Was there anything that stands out to you from your interaction with any  particular students?  Gonzales There was a young woman. It was very short, but she was like,    I feel like I  can write now the things that I   ve been wanting to write.    That   s a common  thread in the work that I do. I think it just keeps reinforcing how important it  is to just, in a very small way, say your story matters, and then to do a  workshop like last night where we spend a little bit of the time talking about  why it matters gives people just that little nudge, as opposed to doing things  where like,    here   s really how to write a poem    and    here   s how to craft it,     just that entryway into saying,    You   ve got to do it, and whatever story you  have is, that   s what we need to hear. Now we can look at all the different  ways in which to cultivate it and articulate it,    but just to say,    Yes. This  thing, this thought that you have, this experience that you have, say that.  Write that.    I always appreciate when students are like   sometimes we get  stuck in our heads.     Nobody else would care about this    or    Why am I writing it?    but yeah, so  many people have had something they can relate to. We   re going to learn  from that story. Yeah, and then I think that was what the other students were  saying as well when they came up to me of, it was a validation of,    I thought  I should do this, but I   m not sure. No one   s encouraging me    or to be like,     Oh, this is a whole world. I got to start going with it.    There was one  student who does visual art, and he   s like,    I need to do art that says  something,    and I was like,    Yeah. Do that.    (Laughs) Yeah. I think it   s  hard because I remember being a student, and I would never want to bother  the speaker, you know? (Laughs) I   d just be like,    Uh,    but I think people  do that more now these days. I really appreciate it because I never want to  be like,    Oh, that   s an expert up there.    I never consider myself an expert. I  like when they share their stories with me because then I learn, too.  Neurohr In what ways do you change your program format for different  circumstances or audiences?  Gonzales I do all the time. That   s why it   s like, it   s not, I don   t have a canned  program. I have this structure.    We   re going to do some writing, and I   m  going to do some, a piece up here.    I have developed a theory around it after  doing so many of them, and it   s basically, it   s called    education, connection,  and action.    Every program will have those elements, but all the ways that it  looks will always be different, depending on the audience. The education is  like,    Let   s be on the same page of, here   s a topic that we   re talking about.  What are the different thoughts around it?    We did identity, Latino versus  Hispanic versus different labels, and then the connection is the storytelling  piece, what their stories are and how it connects. That   s going to be different  every time, and then the action is the writing or the coming up with an idea.  6  Then I never even just type it out, and I know it   s different from other folks  that I know that do consulting or work like this. They   ll have it printed out,  and I don   t because it needs to be flexible enough for who   s in the room and  what they   re sharing. I have handwritten notes of like,    Here   s the pieces  that you want to talk about,    but then the things that they say and do, it  depends on what they   re doing. I just like it that way. With this group, it  was, yeah, to just get them writing and to be thinking about what it means to  be where they   re from. Yeah. It   s different every time. Some people don   t  understand. They   re like,    Why is it expensive?    and I was like,    This is not  just the fifty minutes I   m standing in front of you. It   s the two to three hours  that I   m researching and then looking up things and having a feel for who  might be in the room there.     Neurohr Are you reading the audience as you   re talking with them?  Gonzales Yes. I feel like it   s always hard to say,    What do you do?    or    What   s your  skill?    If I could say something that I feel like I have a good skill is being a  facilitator. It doesn   t sound as cool as it is, but basically I am really good at  reading the room and picking up on everyone   s energies and what   s  working, what   s not working, and being able to be flexible. I can feel when  someone really wants to say something but they   re too shy. I   ll be like,    Oh,  did you want to share anything?    and they   re like,    Okay.    (Laughs) It   s  getting the, moving in and what works, and everyone there was so great. I   m  not usually, I don   t usually joke as much, but I felt really comfortable doing  that last night because they were really open to a good, open energy.  Neurohr Well, you were very engaging with them, and even for some of the students  that were occupied with their smartphones, pretty soon they started putting  them aside. Yeah, I think there   s a lot of multitasking that students do now.  It was interesting, from my perspective, to watch how that happened, and  then when you invited them to pick up the pencils and open the notebooks  and start writing, the room was just quiet. (Laughter)  Gonzales Yeah, I know. Yeah, I   ve had to relearn those things because sometimes, I  used to be like,    Well, if you want to share something, I   m just going to  move away and let you share,    but I   ve learned there   s a balance there of  encouraging people or even pushing people in a safe way to do it, right,  because if I   m like   we used to run them, I used to run it where we would  have people write and then come up to the mic.    Anybody want to share?    It  would be two or three people. They would share really great things, but once  I   m continuing to look at different dynamics and identities, who does that,  mostly men will feel less awkward about just jumping up on a mic and being  like,    Well, it   s a rough draft, but it   s really good. My stuff is good,    which  is great.  7  Women in particular don   t as much, and then looking at other different  dynamics of what that looks like. I shifted it a couple years ago where we  pick a line and we make one group poem because that solidifies us as a  community. It gets to the idea that everybody does have a voice and we  don   t hear from them all the time, as opposed to this superstar, competitive  side that was taught to me of one mic, one person. We still do some of those  events, but all the workshops, when it   s more about the educational piece is  everybody participates. It   s just shifted everything. We just have so many,  it   s very rare for someone not to participate because I   ll say,    At least one  word. If you can say it into the circle, it   s our gift, and this is one poem that  we   ve created.    It makes it way more accessible for people to share, and we  hear so many more stories. Yeah.  Neurohr That was a pretty large group to do that with last night. What is the largest  number that you   ve been able to do the large group poem with?  Gonzales Yeah, that was a large group. It never feels large. I   m like,    Ah, we   re just,  we   re here because you heard peoples    names and you   ve heard their  stories,    and then I   m like,    Oh, that was fifty-seven people?    (Laughter) I  did one in Detroit at a conference, the Allied Media Conference, and that  was, I think there was sixty-five, seventy people in the room. It was a really  large, yeah, but it was, again, all about community organizing. We talked a  bit about   no, somebody said something. They used the b-word. People  were bristling, and I   m like,    This is exactly, you cannot, we have all these  voices in our community, and this is what it looks like when someone is  silent.        This is what it looks like when someone takes up too much space. This is  what it looks like when we have problematic views that we   re trying to fish  out and understand. You can   t just say,    Well, then you   re not in our  community.    It doesn   t necessarily work like that. How do we understand  that all the words that you just said impacted everybody in this room?    It   s a  good conversation and just a theory of    This is how we operate. Your  community could be your family and the five people in it, or your  community could be Oklahoma State, this entire campus.    It   s always  fluctuating, and the more that we can be intentional about the ways in which  we participate in it is really important.  Neurohr Let   s shift directions here just a little bit. Where are you from originally?  Gonzales I   m from Muskogee, Oklahoma. Was born and raised there.  Neurohr What was it like there when you were growing up?  Gonzales I   ve always thought of Muskogee as the city because there   s so many small  towns around it. Once I left Muskogee, it was like,    Oh, Muskogee   s kind of  8  small,    but when I was there, I was like,    Oh, this is the city.    People would  come there. Growing up there, my dad, in particular, but both of my parents  would talk about issues since we were very young like racism, in particular.  I was always aware of people   s culture and dynamics that existed. Again,  it   s almost, when I left there, when I would even just go on trips or  something is when I can compare because once, if you   re there, it   s all you  know and it   s normal to you, but once I left, even this trip back, I   m like,    I  miss African-Americans in my everyday life.    Arizona has less than two  percent in the state. I know that, but then to be around it, I   m like, that   s  such a   that culture in general is such a big part of my culture. Being one of  the only what I felt was Mexican, Mexican-American in school and things  like that, I was, I chose and I was relegated, teachers or whoever would put  me with that group, with African-Americans, and where we lived, which  was, put me with the African Americans because there wasn   t Latinos to be  part of.  It was like,    Well, you   re brown,    and Native was a whole other category.     You   re not Native. We   ll just lump you with the black students.    It was this  identity of when I face racism, it was because the other group was white.  Then I found solidarity with African-Americans in particular. It was  interesting. Growing up, it was pretty multicultural, having black teachers,  not just all white teachers, and the kids in the class coming from all different  walks of life. I just remember students being very poor and the bullying that  would happen and just observing it and watching it, students who had  visible physical disabilities, just absorbing all of that and then living through  it and being a brown child with a white mother who would be the one who  would be at the school, who was president of the PTA and stuff like that. All  those dynamics were always there, and being able to process it every day at  dinner because we had to all eat dinner together and talk about    What did  you do?    My dad would ask,    What did you do in school today?    Those  things would come up. We   re like,    Well, we watched Willy Wonka and the  Chocolate Factory for the seventh time in music class.     They would go into the school and be like,    You better teach my child  music.    (Laughter) That dynamic, too, of if you say something, someone is  going to do something about it. Yeah, I remember in elementary school, too,  all the kids that I was friends with, and we would play together and do all  that. Then by the time we reached high school, a number of those students  were already incarcerated or not in school anymore, and that   s been the  running theme for my life is to understand that there is an inequity. I   m  driven to figure it out on a big scale, as opposed to,    Oh, that person  probably did something wrong.    We can   t have that. It   s a trend. Studying  that and working with juvenile detention and looking at the school-to-prison  pipeline has been something that has always interested me because of that  experience, which is why I ended up graduating from Oklahoma State with  sociology. It   s the study of people and their behavior. Yeah, it   s just really, I  9  don   t know if it is the same for everyone, but my upbringing in Muskogee in  particular is super transformative to the things that I wanted to do.  I think it   s because my dad, in particular, put forth the idea that you can  analyze the things that are happening and not just experience them. It   s  always been something in my mind. I have my two brothers. That helps see  (I   m in the middle) that little bit of his older friends. We   re only two years  apart. So I kind of think that   and then my younger brother   s six years  younger. Then seeing the differences between our experiences in school was  such a big part of it. Being out in Muskogee and the city vibe and some of  the violence, and I   ve just always been a person that people will tell their  stories to without asking too much. People, even today, are like,    That  person barely knows you, and they told you their whole life story and very  deep, personal things.    I   m like,    I don   t know why.    (Laughter) They just  do. Even back then, the violence that they would endure or perpetrate among  other people, they would just tell me. I have a vault of stories within me of  people. It always helps me analyze what   s happening and how we build  structures and why. That was a roundabout way of saying a lot of things.  Neurohr You mentioned that the Native American was a whole other category. Can  you elaborate on what you mean by that a little bit?  Gonzales Yeah. Such a large Native population here but when I was growing up, I  didn   t understand all the history and genocide and the inequity there. It was  one part normalized. I remember being in elementary school and having  dancers come in in full regalia and performing, and since I was one of the  few Mexicans, they would, I assume they thought I was Native. They would  pick me out of the audience and dance with them, those things, and I had  friends who were Native, some I didn   t know until later that they were  Native. It   s something that   s a construct of my experience in Oklahoma, but  when I left and moved to Arizona, I actually went to the Heard Museum in  Phoenix. I took a group of my students there, and that   s where I learned  about the boarding schools. I was so angry that I wasn   t taught that here. My  friend, Kim, that I mentioned last night, her dad worked at Bacone College   Muskogee, Oklahoma .  I would go and stay over there and hang out with her. I knew it was a Native  school, but I didn   t know it used to be a boarding school or some of those,  how it changed a bit. I was quite angry. I   m reading in a museum in Arizona  about my hometown and about Oklahoma, and I just was like,    I was  hoodwinked.    (Laughter) I remember talking about history, but it was never  framed like,    This was an inequity.    That   s probably also part of my  privilege of not being Native in Oklahoma and not having to know that  through my familial lines. I   m sure folks know quite well some of that  trauma that existed, but in another way, it was an interesting experience to  10  only, to see their resilience. I never thought of Natives as struggling. I just  thought of them as very powerful and very tied to culture.  Neurohr How do you identify yourself, racially, ethnically?  Gonzales I don   t like labels. (Laughs)  Neurohr Oh, you don   t like labels? That   s okay.  Gonzales No, I don   t. I just think it   s more like a conversation, as opposed to a  checking a box thing. It   s always interesting. Of course I knew I was  Mexican growing up because my dad is Mexican, but again, operating in  Muskogee, there weren   t other people to relate to. I grew up with a lot of  black culture, like I said. I never identified as black. I   m Mexican, but then  also I   m multiracial. That wasn   t really a term, either, for me until much  later, and to say,    Oh, that   s an experience.    It evolves over time, and then  there   s this interesting experience of   about people that label you for you.  They treat you in that way. It   s hard to get out from under it or not be  impacted by it. In Oklahoma, I felt like I was a person of color, and I was  less tied to a certain identity. Then I moved to North Carolina, and I worked  at Duke. There was very few Latinas in upper administration. I was super  Latina. (Laughs)  They would just come to me with everything Latina-related and everything  from,    I found the best tortillas, Safeway aisle nine    (I   ll be like,    What?   )  to    This Latina student group needs an advisor. Can you do it?    Then going  to Arizona, it was the flip of there   s so many Latinos there, and we don   t  even use the term Latino. You are nothing. You   re multiracial, and I   m like,     Oh.    Crossing state lines is like    how Latina you are    experience. I identify  now as a Chicana. There   s a very political aspect to it. Yeah, and all of the  things Chicana and biracial, multiracial. Sometimes I say Latina for the sake  of understanding, but with Mexican roots. In the Spanish language, too, to  be, it   s a, there   s gender in it, to be Chicana as opposed to Chicano. It   s  wrapped in to be not just a person of color but a woman of color. It has a  meaning.  Neurohr Did you grow up speaking Spanish?  Gonzales No. My dad is from the generation that were beaten for speaking Spanish  when they were children. He speaks it fluently, but he did not pass it on to  us. He says it   s because we moved away from family. We grew up, again,  not very many Spanish-speaking folks in the town. He didn   t have anyone to  speak it with. My mom taught us more Spanish than my dad because she  was a teacher, would teach us. We would have times growing up where  we   d be like,    Okay. For the next two hours, you can   t speak any English,     but it was very vocabulary-based of like,    Um, leche, please.    (Laughter) It  11  was short-lived. We heard it when my dad would call home, but that just  wasn   t there. Then we would visit family in San Antonio, and my  grandmother, my dad   s mother, only spoke Spanish.  You find ways to communicate outside of language, but when I went to  college, I started, that was my whole identity for Latino. Again, my friend  Carlos just called everybody in the OSU phonebook that had a Spanish-sounding  last name. (Laughs) I was like,    All right. I like people. I   ll go.     That   s when I started seeing and hearing of oh, these things that my dad  does or that we experienced as a family is somewhat tied to culture, which  was very helpful because my dad was a very strong figure. It was hard for  me, as a very emotional person and emotional child, to take some of that,  but then when I talked to other women and students in the group, I   m like,     Oh, some of that is tied to cultural things of being strict, a family being  strict about what you can and can   t do and what it means to be a female.    It  was helpful to be like,    Oh, okay. It   s not just me messing up a lot or my  dad being a horrible person. There are dynamics there.    It was helpful.  Then when I came to college, I felt like I was missing out on a lot from the  people in my family like my grandmother who only spoke Spanish. I started  taking courses then. I was very fluent in written, but they didn   t make you  speak it very often. We did plays and stuff in Spanish. Then yeah, that   s  where it was. I speak more than either of my two brothers, and I speak with  my father. There   s a whole identity around how much you speak, and almost  everyone you ask, even in Arizona,    Do you speak Spanish?       Eh.     (Laughter) It   s like,    Eh,    but then they   ll speak it what you would consider  fluently with their family, those folks. There   s a lot of people, of,    You   re  not Mexican enough if you don   t speak it,    but it   s in all different ways.  Someone will say they   re not fluent, but they are because people always are  like,    Oh, you messed up there.     There   s a pocho Spanish, which is Spanglish, and    ew    that you speak that,  you know what I mean? There   s a, starts to be a hierarchy of    how Mexican  or how Latino are you?    but it   s really ridiculous because people in Arizona  in the Sonora area, the dialect is very different from central Mexico or even  Mexicans living in Oklahoma. The dialect is so different. You   re never  going to be   you cannot be fluent in Spanish. Spanish is a multitude of  dialects and language and vocabulary. My brother, my younger brother is a  doctor. The vocabulary he needs is really specific to working with patients  and around anatomy and pain and those kinds of things. People, even who  are Native   even English is the same. I might not know some of those  words, right? It depends. Some people might be very fluent in things around  laundry because their parents ran drycleaners or something. I can understand  it when I   m in Mexico. I   ll speak it when I   m in Mexico, but here, I don   t  speak it.  12  Neurohr What led you to come to OSU for college?  Gonzales I don   t know how I got involved in this, but when I was in high school, there  was a math and science camp. I had an emphasis in biochemistry, and I  vaguely remember that there were other emphases. We weren   t all in  biochemistry. It was a math and science camp, and then later I think it was  tied to getting more students of color involved in science fields, a STEM  thing. However it was, I applied and got accepted. In high school, I came  here for, I don   t know how long it was. It was residential, more than a week,  somewhere around there, and did lots of projects in biochemistry. I think  they kept that relationship. Then I got a scholarship to come here to study  science. It was that, and it was far enough away from home. I did want to  get out. (Laughs) Also navigating the college application process. My mom  didn   t go to college. My dad did but in a very circuitous way. It wasn   t the  traditional graduate from high school, go to college. It was hard to navigate  what that looked like.  I was doing some of that on my own. I was like,    Well, we live here. I   ll  definitely apply here    and because I had gone to that program, I never  considered OU for some reason. (Laughs) I was like,    Well, Oklahoma  State, obviously. That   s the better one.    Then North Carolina, I applied to  UNC because I had family there. We would visit, but I had no concept of  how you apply and what your GPA needs to be and standardized tests, the  GREs and things like that. Then I think I applied to some, I applied to a  college in, I think it was in Portland. It was called Reed College. It   s still  around. I think it   s a private   and I applied for that because there was a guy  I met named Reed. He was really cute. (Laughter) I didn   t get into those,  and I got into Oklahoma State. I was like,    Cool. I know it    because I had  spent time there and I   d lived in the residence halls. It was very comfortable  to go there, and I already knew faculty and other students that were going. I  was like,    Yeah, that   s where I   m going.     Neurohr What year did you come?  Gonzales I graduated high school in    94. I came in    94 to    99.  Neurohr You mentioned the scholarship. Did you start out then as a science major?  Gonzales Yes. I was majoring in biochemistry for two years, yeah. It was   yeah. It  was the other thing of how do you decide what you want to do? I grew up  with everyone working in the medical field. That was what was valued. My  parents were like,    Yeah, science is what you got to do,    and the way that I  was raised and other dynamics, I   m a perfectionist. I   m going to do well  even if it   s not the thing that I like the most. I did it for two years, and I just,  it was hard because it was not what I wanted to do. Once you get to things  like calculus and chemistry and you   re like,    Ugh,    when something gets to  13  be a struggle and difficult, then you know. If it   s your passion, you have the  energy to get through it, and if it   s not, then you don   t get through it. It was  then that I started switching. I would love to see the records, but I feel like I  changed my major on paper at least ten times. It was a graduation from  biochemistry to computer science (like it   s still legit) to English to  journalism to   my parents were like,    Just graduate.    and I   m like,     Sociology.    (Laughter)  Neurohr Let   s talk about your college experience at OSU some more. Where did you  live when you were a student here?  Gonzales I started out in Willham, the residence halls, and yeah, I remember that  really clearly of being moved in by my family. I was excited. Like I said, it  had helped to be familiar with the campus and stuff. I was like,    Oh, I know  this.    It was all-cool, and then they pulled away. Like I said, sometimes it  was difficult to be so controlled and managed. I was like,    Yeah.    and then  they pulled away. I was like,    Oh shit.    (Laughter)    Oh my God  I   m really  on my own.    I just started crying. (Laughter) It was interesting, but yeah, I  started out in Willham with the roommate and those big towers. It was just a  dream to have so many people and that everybody was in the same situation.  It wasn   t weird to be like,    Hi, I   m Sarah.    You have to meet each other,  and everybody wants to meet each other and crazy things. They faced each  other, the male tower and the female tower. We would do, we didn   t have  cell phones. (Laughter) We did flashlight our number across, and then they  would call.  The phone would ring, and we   d be like,    Hmm, hello?    (Laughter) Yeah,  all those things. The programming and having worked in res idential  life  now for so many years at three different universities, I realize what goes into  it. People are like,    Come and eat with us. Come and hang out. We   ll have  sand volleyball.    This is what they used to have in between there and all  those things. Yeah, I participated in a lot of things, and it was just also that  my brother was older than me. He came for a year and then switched,  because of grades, to being out of OSU. That was very much in my mind as  a pressure point because it was a difficult experience for him. When I came,  I was like,    This is all super fun,    and I think I made a 4.0. Then I was like,     Well, that was easy. I don   t need to study nearly as much,    and then I did  terrible. (Laughter) Then I spent the rest of my time pulling that up. It was a  five-hour calculus at 8:00 a.m. I was like,    Who let someone take that?     (Laughs) Oh yeah.  Neurohr Did you live other places besides Willham?  Gonzales I feel like I lived in every residence hall on campus. (Laughter) I lived in  Willham. I really loved it, and then I met one of my best friends, Alicia. She  lived in Kerr-Drummond, and it was an accessible room because she used a  14  wheelchair. Then the next year, I moved there. We were neighbors, and then  I moved to Iba. I was upperclassman. The third year I moved to Iba, and  then I moved to, then I was an RA after that. They were like,    You should  be an RA  residential advisor .    and I was like,    Okay.    Then I was an RA  in Wentz Hall. I don   t know if it is now, but it was considered the  international student hall because it was the only one that was year-round. I  don   t know how people get placed, but I was placed there. I went there.  Neurohr What student organizations were you active in?  Gonzales All of them. (Laughs) I had to do a journal for a class, and I still have it. I  remember reading it, and it was like,    Here are the facets of my life.    It   s  being involved in different things and working at the front desk and then, oh  yeah, class. (Laughter) I feel like the instructor was like,    Uh, let   s look at  that.    (Laughs) In Willham, when I first started, I don   t know how, but there  was a   I think it was the complex director or something. I feel like her  name was Martina. Somehow, I had met them. I started a diversity club. I  don   t remember what it was   Spectrum or something. I think it was called  Spectrum. I just started it, and I was like,    We should be doing this kind of  stuff.    I remember I got my friends on the wing to do it with me, and it was  things like, I remember I printed out a picture of something. I think it was a  neo-Nazi guy or something, and then I just wrote,    No hate. We shouldn   t  have hate.     Then we just taped them up in every bathroom on every fourteen of the  floors, and then we got in trouble. They were like,    You can   t put things on  the mirror.    I   m like,    It   s against hate.    (Laughter) We did that, and then  she was helpful in getting me to do more with it and programming. We  would just bring people in to talk in the residence hall and on the mezzanine.  We would have little programs. I was one of those people I think they call     lounge lizards.    I would just be in the lounge at all hours of the day and  night and just talk to people and have friends, and then I would be like,    Oh,  you should come to the mezzanine. We   re going to have these programs,    a  lot of panels of people just talking about their experiences. It was  interesting. People would come up, but I remember when we were talking  about LGBT issues. I don   t know. I was na  ve or something, but I was just  like,    Cool. Let   s go out where the program is about LGBT issues.     They were like,    Nah, we   re cool on that,    and I was like,    Well, we   re  friends. Why?    They   re like,    Uh, no.    That   s when I started realizing. I   m  like,    Oh.    Racism had been taught to me like the KKK, you know what I  mean? An oppression. For any of the identities, it was very extreme because  honestly, the night before I came to OSU (my dad showed me this) where it  was watching documentaries, and it was about the KKK and that their  headquarters were in Tulsa. I was like,    I don   t want to go.    Stillwater was  small back then compared to Muskogee in my head. I don   t know if it was. I  15  think it was legitimately also. (Laughs) I had these nightmares the night  before that people were going to burn a cross on the residence hall where I  lived, and I was like,    I don   t want to go.    Then my mom, she   s so funny.  She was like,    Okay. Well, you can stay here. You can go to Connors in our  town, and you can live here with us.    She said it just like that. I was like,     Okay. Get in the car.    (Laughter) Of course, it wasn   t like that at all, but it  was just seeing all that horrificness. It did come up in different ways, and  even being, again, Mexican and the identity that I had, I remember those  same guys in the lounge. I think we were talking about being Hispanic. I  started getting involved. I was like,    Well, we   re having a panel,    and they  were like,    Are you Hispanic?    I was like,    Yeah,    and they were like,    Let  me see your, what   s your last name?    I was like,    Gonzales,    and they were,  they started laughing because it was so foreign to them. The only thing they  knew was Speedy Gonzales, right? This is the image that they had from  being in non-diverse areas around Oklahoma. They made me give them my  student ID because they did not believe my last name was Gonzales.  It   s just because you only have one idea of what it means to be Mexican, and  me, a person that you   ve gotten to know and like, that does not fit your  definition of Mexican, which is dirty, poor, doesn   t speak any English kind  of thing. Their minds were just blown, and they were like,    I can   t believe  that.    To me, I was like,    This is so weird,    those dynamics. The Hispanic  Student Association, we went to San Antonio. I think it was, oh, to watch  OSU play in a bowl game, and my dad   s family lives there. I   m like,    Oh,  I   m going to stay with my uncle.    We were in a hotel, and I   m like,    Oh,  I   m going to call them.    That was how na  ve I was.    I   m going to call my  uncle. I   m going to look in the phonebook.    His name is Roberto Gonzales,  and I was like,    Oh my god. There   s 9,000 pages of Roberto Gonzaleses and  50,000 pages of Gonzaleses.    That was my own frame of mind around it,  too, of    Oh, okay. Got it.    (Laughter) Anyway, we started doing those  programs.  I was part of that diversity group, and then when I met my friend and we,  somehow, I don   t know how she got connected to other people who were in  wheelchairs. They started a group called   oh no, it was called the  Challengers. We would go, and I was part of that group as an ally. I just  loved people. I went, and I would listen to them talk. They would organize  around different things. I used those elements much later in college in  writing papers about student identity as what higher ed is all about, and my  best friend in college in my master   s degree also used a wheelchair. We co-wrote  papers together, and the experience was really important, again, of, to  have a visible physical disability is, there are many ways in which to get  them, right? Whether you were born with something, that you started out  with it or you acquired it later in life through injury, there   s so many  dynamics of identity around that. There was this one guy. He used a  16  motorized wheelchair here at Oklahoma State, and he was hard to  understand, his voice.  You could if you really were intently listening, but if you weren   t, it was  really hard to understand. He would wear this shirt that said    We can still  fuck    around to the bars, and I just thought it was so   it was empowering  because people are always like,    Oh, poor you. You   re in a wheelchair. I  don   t want to be with you. I can   t even understand what you   re saying.  You   re probably not all there capacity-wise, even though you   re at a  college,    you know what I mean? For him to do that was   this is pushing  back against this idea, and there is now knowing a lot more about sexual  identity and physical disability. That was a title of one of our papers in grad  school. I always put fake titles and then put it later, the inspiration. We  almost hit send, and I   m like,    Wait. The title is    We can still fuck    still.  We   ve got to take that off.    (Laughter) Yeah, part of that group, and then  got to be part of the Hispanic Student Association from my first year and  being super involved in that.  Like I said, I joined Afro-Am first right off the bat because I was scared  about crosses being burned in my   the first day I went to Afro-Am. My  brother   s RA was in Afro-Am. We had met previously. He knew that I was  coming. He was part of it. I was like,    I know people there.    I went in there,  and later I stayed friends with everyone. One of the guys was like,    When  you rolled up in that meeting, I   m like,    This woman got some balls.        (Laughter) I was like,    Well, I   m not scared of you. This is the people that I  grew up with.    I was feeling really relieved to be there. Being involved in all  of those and then residence life, being involved in that and doing that and  always being involved in the diversity aspect of it, and I would always lead  a diversity committee. I ran a radio show on the radio, the student radio,  with a friend of mine. We played ska at midnight. (Laughter) Many, many,  many organizations.  Neurohr What was the radio show about?  Gonzales It   s whatever the campus radio station is. You just signed up, and you could  take a   we just played ska music. Ska is a kind of punk and   ska, it   s a  version of punk music, yeah. I was like,    Cool. We   re running a radio  show.     Neurohr It sounds like you held several leadership positions in official capacities and  maybe non-official capacities as well.  Gonzales Yeah, totally. Yes, and coming from high school where I was very quiet and  not, I was not in any leadership. I played soccer and I was in theatre, but I  did not lead anything. It was quite a shift to then lead all of the things, to be  super involved in that way. That was just a core skill that I developed here,  17  and I don   t know. I   m sure there are all, multiple elements of how that  happened, but it was something that served me well the rest of my life.  Neurohr Do you recall if you had some leadership training, either through Reslife or  something where this was, there was, I guess, training that occurred to help  develop leadership skills at all?  Gonzales No, nothing formal like that. I think it   s those informal connections that are  crucial. It was really, joining the Hispanic Student Association, it was like,  again, refuting the definition of what    leader    has been defined for me as  and then seeing out of,    We just wanted family around, and we   re doing  some stuff. Can you help with this?    I   m like,    I can do that.    I   m the  historian. I love taking pictures. I like making flyers. That   s what I did, and  then you see how people do it. It wasn   t like,    You   re just a student  participant, and we have our staff meetings over here    or    You   re just a  historian. Go do that. We   re doing it over here.    It was very much like,     Let   s figure this out together,    and I happen to be the person that gets the  label of president, you know? I think it was that accessibility that was  helpful, and residence life is this similar   it   s certainly about the holistic  view of,    Okay, we do have staff meetings, but what should we do?    It was  more of that.  Neurohr I remember when we were talking earlier you mentioned a trip to Chicago.  Gonzales Yes.  Neurohr Tell me a little bit about that.  Gonzales It   s a national Hispanic leadership conference that happens in Chicago. I  think it happens there every year because I think I heard about it recently. I  was already president of HSA by that time, and our advisor, Rolando Diaz,  had just left. There was no one in that position. I don   t remember how it  happened, but somebody gave me access to funds. I was like,    We have to  go here.    I did some research, and I got together, I guess, who could go.  Even just looking at the pictures, there was a number of us, thirteen at least,  who went, and we paid for all of it and registered. We went there and  participated in this conference, and then that   s when they were like,    Oh,  okay. We need an advisor. We   re just going to spend all our money.    It was  really cool because again, we were all friends, and like I was saying earlier,  there was a core group of us that we were all friends.  Even though some people came in and out, they were still part of the family,  and then people who were there all the time, we were good friends. Then  people that we didn   t like as much or I didn   t get along with, they were still  part of it. I appreciate that. All those people went. I just remember being on  the plane and feeling like I was responsible, even though some people were  18  older than me. Even the past president who had recruited me in was part of  that. We hit a lot of turbulence on the plane, and I was like,    I   m going to  get everyone killed.    (Laughter) It was cool to go there, and again, it was  like,    Oh my god. There are Latino leaders from all over the country here  talking and having fun.    We had speakers. We met Al Gore. He was there  speaking, and I was like,    There   s power.    I started to understand. I   m like,     A politician like Al Gore wants to talk to us. There   s a power there. We  should be organizing and talking about these things.     Neurohr You were looking at the scrapbooks just a little while ago, and these are the  Hispanic Student Association scrapbooks. Talk about that a little bit, if you  would.  Gonzales I was really thinking of it because I have all those photos. I was historian.  (Laughs) I have all the replicas at my house, and I look at them. I do look at  them from time to time, but this time, looking at them as a collection (some  of them, I   m not in, some, I   m in, and then there   s people who came after  me) is an interesting feeling. I   m like,    Oh.    I always live in the moment of  whatever   s happening right now. It   s important to look forward and it   s  important to honor the past, but I never see myself in that. I was reflecting  last night after taking a peek at them and then seeing them today that, how  important it is to have that documentation and to feel like you were part of  something, and then that, in conjunction with the workshop, of having  students be like,    Someone has done elements of this. It   s not as scary. I can  figure it out.    There was just something in Tucson.  There   s a lot around history because it keeps getting taken away, the  banning of ethnic studies and stuff like that. You understand how important  it is, but I   ve never had, I had never felt part of a history that was valued in  any way. Maybe for myself and my family, but not institutionally. This is  one of the first times that institutionally I   ve seen it valued, and I was like,     Whoa, that   s heavy.    (Laughter) It was good to be reminded. My  memories, I have a weird memory. It   s hard to remember those things, but  when I visually see a picture, then I remember those people that I hadn   t  thought about. With the onset of social media and things like Facebook, it   s  easy, but I still am taken back by the idea that I haven   t thought to look up  these people, right? For me, I   m like,    Who are my connections right now?     Not to abandon them, but relationships fluctuate. Then to think about,    Oh, I  could just reach out, and I   ll probably find this person.    To me, growing up  without social media, that   s not a genuine relationship. I still love and care  about those people, and if I am meeting up with some of them this trip, I   m  interested in that. It   s just secondary to think about,    Oh, I could Facebook  them.    You know what I mean? Those photographs, I think, are really  important to see that, and it helps take what your memory might be and then  make it into focus. It was so multicultural. I knew that it was, but I didn   t  19  remember as much of it, right? Then you   re,    Oh, talk about the Hispanic  Student Association.    You start talking about it, but then sometimes we  don   t think to ask,    How were the other three centers a part of that or not a  part of that?     Those are really interesting questions. To see Diane Nguyen, who was  president of the Vietnamese Student Association at the time, in all those  photos, I talk to her now. I am Facebook friends with her, but yeah, that was,  we learned so much about Vietnamese culture. We never had this idea of  just Asian culture because it was very specific, and then later I looked into  it,    Why was it just VASA? Why wasn   t it an Asian   what is the interesting  dynamic about Oklahoma and Vietnamese folks, right?    just learning about  those different things and being part of each other   s culture in that way,  yeah. I   m very appreciative, and it makes me think now for my own youth  organization that I   m running how documentation is very important.  Neurohr Are there any particular campus activities or campus traditions that stand  out to you if you think back?  Gonzales Well, when I was mentioning earlier, it was Cultural Night. I think of it in  this way. There are some that the institution puts forth like Homecoming.  I   m sure there   s other ones, but I never felt like that was for me.  Homecoming was very much a Greek thing, maybe even if it wasn   t. I  didn   t really participate in it, but there were other things that I think are  campus traditions or should be defined as such. Cultural Night was one of  them because I remember the president of the university coming out to that.  I can   t remember the venue. It   s on campus, but it was a full stage and  stadium seating. It was annual. I lived in the international hall. I lived in  Wentz, at the time, when I started hearing about it and participating in it.  People work with their home countries and the consulate to get resources to  bring forth their cultural dance. It was very international, and because I lived  in the international hall, there would always be a lot of work happening on  it. It was a competition. It was judged. We had judges there who were  selected and all that, and I don   t know who put it on. I don   t know. I was  always just participating, but it   s something that stuck with me.  We did it multiple years, and I have tons of photographs. I rarely got to  see   I saw some rehearsals. I rarely got to people   s performance because I  was always backstage. It was this giant, backstage room, and that   s where  all the photographs are. You see people in their traditional outfits from  different countries and different aspects of the culture from the countries  that they   re representing, and we   re all taking pictures. We   re all in our  different outfits taking pictures. Those are some of my best memories. I had  a lot of Japanese friends, and I would always help them. They would get  mail from the residence halls, and they were like,    Is that a   read this to  us.    I   d be like,    Okay. What   s happening is   oh my. You   re getting kicked  20  out because you were smoking. You cannot smoke in your room.    It helped  us have those kinds of connections. Cultural Night was one of them, and my  parents came to that. They came to a few things, but that was one that they  came to. I remember that. Me, too, I danced with the Latin American  Student Association, learning about their culture because that was not mine.  It was a lot of Venezuelan and Ecuadorian and dances like that that I got to  participate in, that I was appreciative of. That was that. I don   t  remember   yeah, I don   t remember other defined traditions in particular.  Neurohr What were some of the gathering places on and off campus?  Gonzales I loved dancing. I spent a lot of time at the Weed. Does that still exist? It   s  called Tumbleweed   s. Oh my god. We spent a lot of time there. When I  lived in Iba, in particular, because most of the people there were older than  me, I just always had that dynamic of the little sister. It was all guys, and  then they would go to the Weed. Then I would drive because I never   I  didn   t drink. I never drink. I still don   t drink. Just didn   t like alcohol. I  would drive and then take them there. Then it became a thing of, I got  involved in the Latin Dance and Cultural Club, of starting it with Frank. I  loved Latin dancing, but we would go there with country dancing. The guys  would be like, dance with   I would dance with all of my guy friends to  show all of the women that they could dance, and then I would leave. Then  they would have dance partners all night because it was very similar to Latin  dancing with the twists and turns and stuff. Then there was a little side club  attached to the Weed which I don   t remember, and they played hip-hop. I  would let them get them situated, and then I would go dance in the hip-hop  side. (Laughs) We spent a lot of time there. Just spent a lot of time in the  residence halls, sitting in the lobby and talking to every single person that  came by.  It was a very diverse group, and they would be like,    Oh.    I remember a  friend who didn   t make it, who dropped out and was like,    I don   t know  how you   re not dropping out. You   re in there all hours of the night and day.     I was like,    I   m up. I want to hear you.    Then working the front desk at  Wentz was just like, I was a staple of the lobby area, but the library was the  other one. That room that we were in last night, it was just, I just thought of  it as a living room. It felt like a home, and I love the fancy chairs. The rest  of the library, I could never study because it was like, I don   t what they call  them. Not folding chairs but generic chairs and then a table. That   s it, but in  that room, it was a fireplace-looking thing. There   s books around, and  there   s carpet and drapes. Doing homework growing up, I was always in my  home in a real, not a fancy chair like that but a real chair and a real table,  like a wood table. We would always go and study there, and we would study  at those wooden tables. I just remember always sitting like this in the big,  fancy chairs and reading, and it was so comfortable. Yeah, I spent a ton of  time in that room in particular, and I always just thought that the building  21  was beautiful. Even just hanging out by the fountain there, and then that  little quad area, we just spent a lot of time there. Then the Union was the  other because we ran student organizations, and we all had our little  cubicles. I feel like it was in the basement.  Neurohr Who stands out to you that had an influence on you, professors or maybe  people who were employed at the university in campus life or student life?  Gonzales Yeah, so many people. My earlier years was the Martina woman who was in  Reslife in some capacity because she had soul. I don   t know what her  background was. She had very blonde hair and was fair-skinned, but she was  very comfortable with people from all cultures and was putting forth the  dynamic that we have to think about these things. She took us. That was my  first trip without my family. She took us to New Orleans for, I don   t even  remember for what. (Laughs) It was for something, but I was like,    Oh my  god.    That blew my mind to be in New Orleans at that time and to see all of  the culture there. It was so different from my experience of being here and  sometimes being in spaces where you   re the only brown person. What  culture looks like is anecdotal or tokenized, and then to be in New Orleans  where it was unapologetically culture everywhere and a mix of culture really  blew my mind. I saw her very much as a leader, of being like,    This is a  thing.    I don   t remember the specifics, but little things that were happening  that she had to facilitate and manage as a group coming together. That  resonated with me. I   m like,    Oh. You just don   t have a thing happen and  that   s it. You talk about it, and you figure out how to do it.    I saw her taking  us on that trip, and then I see that now when I take young people on.  I took a group of students to San Francisco, and we drove. There   s a lot of  sacrifice you have to make to do those things. I remember her and just being  that leader. I don   t remember his name, that professor, two of them. One  was a creative writing professor, and that was the first time that I had  switched or taken a class that wasn   t science or math-related. It was very  vulnerable for me to be like,    I don   t know what I   m doing,    and I  remember when we went in he was like,    No one gets an A in this class.    I  was like,    Oh.    (Laughs) Put it out there like that. Then I was like,    Okay.  Well, I   m not going to try to get an A. Maybe I can get a B.    I remember we  were supposed to write a story about something, and I went home. I was  typing it on a computer, and I just didn   t know how to end it. I was like,    I  don   t know. I   m going to get an F. I give up,    and I literally ended it with,     Dot, dot, dot.    Then I printed it out, and he was like,    All right. Everybody  turn their papers in.    We all turned them in, and I don   t know why. I don   t  know if it was just old paper, but my paper was brown. All of the papers  went in and it was the white paper, and mine was brown. I was so  embarrassed, and I was like,    Why is my paper brown?    (Laughter) It stuck  out even more, and then he graded them or whatever. We got them back,  and I was like,    Ugh.     22  He puts it on the last page, and I look. It was A+, and I was like,    What? Is  this a mistake?    (Laughter) He wrote little things of why it was good and the  things that I did, even if I didn   t have a final start, beginning, end thing. I  was like,    Well, maybe he lied, and everybody got an A,    but my friends  were like,    Oh, I got a C.    I was like,    Oh.    It was very influential, the way  that he taught, and it was like,    Your writing is good, and here   s why.     Being a female, even in the math and sciences, was like, I was made to feel  dumb constantly. Instead of asking me a question and helping me figure it  out, people were like,    I   ll just do it for you.    I was like,    I   m not even  participating,    which was negatively impacting my learning. I could never  figure out how to do it. There was so many people who would just do it for  me, but I   m like,    I   m going to fail the test because I don   t know how to do  it.    This was a shift of challenging me, of like,    Now do this,    right? It had  nothing to, felt like it had nothing to do with my gender or even my racial  identity. It was very powerful. I really enjoyed that class and him as a  professor, and I got an A. (Laughs) It was also interesting. He was like,    It   s  very difficult to make a living writing. You   re going to write obituaries,     and I was like,    Oh.    (Laughs) He was a keep it real kind of thing, but that  was very influential. Then I just think all the staff throughout residence life.  There was also a woman who was in upper administration of Reslife, and I  remember there was a thing that happened.  I got pulled into her office, and she had this amazing red hair. She had these  high heels, and she was dressed to the nines all the time. It was just her, and  I was very intimidated because I didn   t know her very well. Then I got  called in her office for something negative that had happened. She was  going to ask me about it, and I was like,    Well, here   s really what  happened.    She   s like,    I   m going to tell you this. You   re pretty, you   re  smart, and that is a threat to people. You need to figure out how to get a  thicker skin because it   s going to happen to you, and you still need to make  things happen and to be a leader and not let it move you to a victim status.     No one had ever told me I was pretty. I wasn   t looking for it, but for her to  be like,    You   re smart and pretty, and people are going to be intimidated.  They will try to take you down    from someone that was gorgeous and very  powerful. In that, I was like, it shifted a lot for me to get out of situations  that were not benefiting me. I was like,    Wow.    That was the last time I  remember engaging with her, but it was a very, a strong impression of    Oh,  here   s what a strong person looks like. Here   s what a strong woman looks  like and can articulate these kinds of things.    I was like,    Okay.    I really  took that message to heart. Yeah, Reslife.  Neurohr What did you think that your life would be like when you graduated?  Gonzales Sad and lonely. (Laughter) I still had no idea what I wanted to do, and I  thought when you go to college you figure out what you want to do. I still  had no idea. I was really at a loss of like,    Well, now what?    I mean, I  23  enjoyed it, but it   s hard to translate liking people   s stories and being able to  lead and organize into a profession. A lot of people I knew were either like,  you know you want to be an architect, you know you want to be an  engineer, and then they did that. That wasn   t what I was doing, and then the  other, the only thing remotely related, I had an RA who was an education  major. She   s like,    I   m going to be a teacher. I don   t want to be a teacher,  but that   s all I know. I   m this far. I   m going to do it.    I was like,    I don   t  want to do that.    One thing that my dad taught me was that he loved his job.  I   m like,    I have to do something that I love.    I did, and I had several  majors. I was a history major and all these kinds of things. I just didn   t know  what I was going to do when I graduated. There was a program. I saw a flyer  about AmeriCorps. I was like,    Whoa, I don   t have to do something right  away. I can go here, and I love service, community service. What does that  really look like?    I applied and got accepted into that, and I did that.  There were hall directors who were in grad school. I understood a little bit  more about grad school and what that was, but I wasn   t prepared to launch  right into it. I didn   t know how you did that. I was trying to avoid moving  back home. I knew that that would be difficult because I was a whole other  person. I did that. I went to AmeriCorps, and I remember even doing that  and moving to Arizona to just see what existed in Arizona following a friend  out there. My dad was like,    You   re making a mistake. You should work at  the bank in our hometown,    and I was like,    Mm, no.    (Laughter) I   m like,     Okay. If I stay here, this is what   s going to happen.    It helped me with any  fear I had of, I was like,    Okay. I   ve been a bunch of places now. I can make  something happen there.    I went then to Arizona. For a year, I worked there,  but I started taking classes in higher ed, which is what everybody in Reslife  that I knew in grad school was. It was a thing that I knew. The cultural  centers were a huge impact on me. I   m like,    I want to work at a cultural  center. I want to do that.    I started taking classes, and I made a 4.0. Then I  applied formally because I don   t do well on the standardized tests. I didn   t  have very high scores on those. I don   t know. Was that the GRE? The SATs  are earlier. Because I made a 4.0 and they knew me and then I applied, I got  in. Then I did that, and I graduated with my master   s in higher ed, looking at  student services, stuff like that.  Neurohr You went to the University of Arizona for your master   s degree?  Gonzales Yes.  Neurohr Did you take graduate classes anyplace else?  Gonzales Nope.  Neurohr Talk about your work a little bit, what you   re involved in, what you do?  24  Gonzales Can we take a break?  Neurohr Yeah. We   re back from a quick break. I just asked you to tell me about your  work, your career.  Gonzales Currently, I started a consulting business nationally. It   s called TruthSarita  Consulting, and it   s around providing social justice education and  leadership, whether it   s keynotes or workshops or longer trainings or  curriculum design, things like that. I   ve been doing that for about four years  formally as my own business. It allows me to travel all over the country  doing this work and really talking about the intersections of social justice  and leadership and what it really looks like. Then I also run a, we co-founded  Spoken Futures, Inc. It   s another business, and it really works with  young people using spoken word performance poetry to process and act on  community issues that they see. I do that more locally in Tucson. Then I  started melding them and then being like,    Okay.    Art is another language,  essentially. When you   re talking about things that can be difficult or  complex, then to have another language in which to understand them is very  beneficial.  I started using elements of writing in that but also photography and  movement just so anyone can access them and understand    Okay. Here   s  what it looks like,    even through just movement if I don   t have the words  for it. That   s what I do, and through the consulting, I have a full-time  position at the University of Arizona as their coordinator for the Common  Ground Alliance. That is the intersectional programming between the four  cultural centers, the women   s resource center, and the LGBTQ affairs, doing  that. I really enjoy it. I geek out now on organizational structure. (Laughs)  I   ve done so much around facilitation and learning about the big eight  identities and different dynamics and labels and stuff. I   m always learning,  but I have a very solid grasp on how to do that and get folks talking. Now  I   m looking at organizational structure. How can people organize or come  together, and what are the pinches in the path? How can you open them up  structurally? We have courses at the university that we run called intergroup  dialogue, and when I came in, there was only four people in the course and  not enough to have three full courses.  It became more about, this is an important, the content is extremely  important, but if you don   t have a path for it or a container for it, then it   s  not going to be as effective as it could be. I would do a lot of workshops that  are one-time workshop or one-time diversity training, and then I came to the  point where this is not how we learn. Sometimes institutions or  organizations would be like,    Cool. We did it. Now we don   t have to do  anything else.    I felt irresponsible to be the person that was allowing them to  do that. I stopped doing those and just started looking at,    Okay. I can do a  workshop, but it   s part of a bigger plan.    If you don   t have diverse faculty  25  and you   re trying to look at that, well, I can help you develop a five-year  plan, and part of that might be a workshop for your faculty or whoever   s on  the committee, the search committee, of understanding their bias, their  unconscious bias and things like that. It   s like that, now developing. What  does that look like?  Even with the youth, we have a lot of young people on the microphone and  doing poetry, but we always, as a staff, with the youth, look at who are those  folks. It   s never to penalize a group that   s dominating but to see why does  that exist and who   s not being heard. We didn   t have a lot of queer youth.  Even though I worked at the queer youth center for over a year doing poetry  with them, we still only had one person who would come and compete. We  started looking at it, and we had an opportunity to take over the statewide  gay-straight alliance network. We did. We voted and decided to take it on as  a way to increase structurally our outreach to queer youth in particular. Now  we   re starting to see the benefits of that. I   m always looking at how  organizational structure and helping people look at that, too, in small  community groups and larger institutions. That   s the work that I do, and  along with being a community organizer myself and a poet and performance  artist and those things.  Neurohr Who inspires you?  Gonzales Someone asked that last night, and I said the youth. It   s youth, young  people, and just everyday people. Again, it   s pushing back on this notion  that there   s one person that holds all of the inspiration or power or the  richest person or the person with the most capitalistic power in our society.  The everyday people who lead and organize and take care of the people in  their community because it   s what community is about, they might not ever  get an accolade for it, but because I get to do this work where people are  sharing their stories all the time, then those people come to the forefront. I  think that, I don   t know a good term for folks like that, but people who don   t  do it for the accolades but they do it because it   s important and they know  it   s important. Then certain of those people, it   s a real gift to be able to do it  and to see that. Young people, I see a lot because I work with them, and  their willingness to see themselves as part of a community and what they  can participate in is an inspiration. Then everybody   s who   s just in the thick  of it, raising children and then coming to protests or being the one that holds  space for people who   ve been at the protest and need to decompress,  everybody has a role. People in the neighborhood, that   s my inspiration of,  like,    This is where we live, and we want to make it the best place it can be  for ourselves, our families, and the people we consider our community.     Neurohr You told a story last night about the education transportation issue.  Gonzales Oh yes.  26  Neurohr Would you talk about that a little bit?  Gonzales Yeah. I think art, as it was presented to me growing up, was, it fulfilled an  entertainment quality, and then as I grew older and then saw my father as an  artist and seeing different aspects of it when he would share those stories,  he   s an artist in many ways. We didn   t see it really growing up, and then he  would do little things. For our soccer team, he would paint our banners, and  I   m like,    Whoa, that   s really good.    (Laughs) Everything from building  community. As a child, his older uncles would have him spray-paint on their  cars to make them look cool. That was part of building community, what  that looks like. Now seeing art as a way, again, as another language and as a  way to really be powerful and to change things. It doesn   t have to be the  person in the boardroom, and oftentimes, from different identities, we   re not  allowed in the boardroom. This is another way to do it. Seeing art fill that  idea. Can you repeat that question? I was going somewhere with it. (Laughs)  Oh, the story, yes. Then working with youth, it   s the same of the education,  connection, action. Here   s a piece. Working with the afterschool program in  Tucson, they   re not going to know the school-to-prison pipeline. Not  everybody knows that language. It   s not accessible to everyone, but I know  what it is and I know they   re experiencing it. I will say,    Okay. Well, here   s  the thing. It   s called this, but you might call it something else. What are  some of your experiences of being pushed out? Do you have standardized  testing at your school?       Yes.        Okay. What   s your experience with taking standardized testing? Do you  have school resource officers in your school?       Yes.       What are your  experiences, positive or negative, with those folks? Do you know their  names?    that kind of thing, and then their stories start coming out. It was  similar to something I said earlier. Once they   re saying,    Oh, this is a thing  that exists? I thought it was just me. I   m being made to feel bad because of  my culture or my family who can   t afford it or who are brown like    You   re a  criminal.       They take it and say,    Well, either I hate my family for putting,  not being good enough or I hate myself for not being good enough,    but  once they understand this is a national thing and it happens to a trend of  people and people are doing something about it, young people are doing  something about it, then they   re like,    Okay. Now I can stop expending all  that energy of being down on myself or being made to feel bad and then join  a group of people who are looking at it.    I always tell them,    If you all left  school, none of the adults would have a job.    Then they   re going to listen.  You know what I mean? They have more power than they think they do.  That   s the things that we would look at.    What are people doing? What  would work here?    and then use poetry as a way to be like,    Ugh, I   m really  frustrated. I   m really depressed because I thought I was messing up this  whole time. They told me, I didn   t even do anything, and I got kicked out.     Those were the dynamics that we were all learning from each other.  27  One of our students is in high school. He was waiting for the school bus, and  it never showed up. He finally made his way to school a few hours late.  Instead of just being like,    Okay. I guess I   ll have to do that. Maybe it   ll  come tomorrow,    he was like,    I should ask.    He started asking,    Yo, what  happened here?    Then other students were like,    Oh, I didn   t get the school  bus either. We should ask.    They started organizing themselves and asking,     Why is this happening?    and other folks understanding the history that was  important around it, of that sometimes school districts will stop the  transportation to certain neighborhoods to make it very difficult for students  to make it to school, and then they can justify closing the school because the  enrollment is very low or attendance is very low. They were like,    This  should not exist, and you   re doing it to us because we are a south side  school.    They organized themselves to have a schoolboard meeting. They  organized their own schoolboard meeting, and it was just ridiculously  amazing. They had it at their Catholic church, which is right beside their  high school, which is, of course, where it   s not typically held. They invited  people. People were running for election and reelection at that time for  schoolboards. They reached out and invited them all. They invited all their  families, and then the student was like,    Oh hey, I   m doing a thing. You  should come.    I   m like,    All right.    I come. I   m going to videotape him.  Even when we were doing the program, they weren   t like,    Hey, help us do  this.    They just did it on their own and were like,    Hey, you should come.    I  was like,    All right,    and then I was like,    Whoa.    They asked me to speak  as one of the people. All of their families were there, and it   s a very  intergenerational community. We had elders in the room. We had little kids,  their siblings. They led it from the get-go, and they had, you could see they  put out chairs for all those schoolboard members. You could see who did not  show up. There was an empty chair there. That means a lot, and then the  people who were sitting there. They didn   t have a lot, they were not given a  time to speak. They were like,    You are here to listen    kind of thing. It was  run bilingually, which, they   re not run bilingually, and they started it off  with, he kicked a slam poem about culture and history and resistance and the  power in fighting back and speaking up. I was watching and filming, and the  schoolboard was like,    Who is this kid?    They   re like,    Oh my gosh. They  did all this?    because sometimes you can be like,    Well, probably a teacher  helped them,    but he spoke with such passion. They   re like,    Cool. That set  the tone, and this is what we   re going to do.    It was just amazing. The only  question that they had for them were like,    You can answer this question. If  you   re elected, are you going to return our school busses?    and they all were  like,    Absolutely.    They got their school busses back.  Neurohr Wow. That   s an amazing story. We   re going to take another little break here  for a little bit. I   m going to go ahead and stop the   . After a little break,  we   re back to finish the oral history interview. Today is October 22, 2015.  My name is Karen Neurohr. I   m here with Sarah Gonzales, and we   re  28  talking about her time as a student at OSU and her career and her life and  appreciate your time and sharing this information with us for research  purposes. Thank you.  Gonzales Thank you.  Neurohr When we were talking about student activities and things that you were  involved in here at OSU, what else came to your mind?  Gonzales I was remembering that I went to nearly every single basketball game. I just  grew up in a basketball-loving family, and I was excited to participate in it.  My friend and I would go, and she used a wheelchair. She was in accessible  student seating, which was basically courtside at the time, but people who  were not using wheelchairs could not fit there. Most of the time, I would,  they would have me sit at the press table. (Laughs) I was very courtside next  to people in the press doing radio and things like that. My family would  always be like,    We saw you again.    It was really nice. It was just super fun  to be there at all the basketball games, and it was a very small, intimate  court. Everybody that went there, I just remember all of that and the final  four and going to, what, is it  Gallagher  Iba  Arena ? I was going to the  court at midnight to welcome the team back from the final four, and I got  lots of pictures and stuff from that. Yeah, and the football games, absolutely,  as well. I really participated in that. I think we got onto the field one time,  which is probably not allowed now. (Laughter) Yeah, the athletics were, it  was a fun way to participate in some of the OSU pride.  Neurohr What significant events do you remember happening from your time here as  a student?  Gonzales Well, I guess that the Oklahoma City bombing happened in    95. That was a  very significant   one of those things that you, people always talk about    I  remember where I was when that happened.    I lived in Willham, and I  would walk over to Kerr-Drummond to pick up my friend. Then we would  walk to class together. She was still getting ready. I was just waiting in her  room. She had the radio on a pop station, and all of a sudden, it cut out. I  was like,    I wonder what happened,    and then the DJs came back on. They  were like,    We don   t know what   s happening. There   s a giant shake of the  building.    I just was very nervous. I   m just like,    What   s happening? What  happened?    and she was not. She was very nonchalant. She was like,    When  are you going to go to class?    It didn   t rectify itself. We were walking to  class, and I dropped her off. Then I went into a building where there was a  room in the middle where people could sit and watch TV between classes,  and there was a bunch of people. I was going to Spanish class.  There was a ton of people, and they were standing and looking at the TV.  Then I joined them, and then we just started seeing all of the images from it.  29  Of course, really terrifying and heartbreaking, and then there were different  things. You know all the misinformation and things like that that would  happen, to hear about some students and whoever, students and community  members maybe who caused some physical structure damage on campus,  throwing bricks through the mosque, things like that where it started being  people of Middle Eastern descent are responsible. There were a lot of things  of, Connie Chung got a lot of media because I think she said,    Who cares  about Oklahoma?    like it   s whatever. It was interesting to see all that  because we, it was the largest terrorist plot on US soil at that time. Just to  see it unfold and the images and just being inundated with all the imagery  and things like that. Yeah. It was very significant. When it happened with  9/11, I was at University of Arizona. It just brought back everything. I was a  staff member, and I was like,    This is what   s going to happen.     Everyone was so in shock that they could not move through it to protect  students and things like that. It did happen all over again. One of the things  when it happened at OSU, when I was at OSU, that really propelled me  forward in the work that I do because I could be very upset and angry at a  lot of things that happened, a lot of injustice, but it was burning me out. It  was that, in particular, there was so much hate around it when it turned out  to be two white guys who did it. That, and then the birth of my nephew that  I was like,    I can still address injustice, but if I do it with love, out of a place  of love, then I   m going to have energy to want to create a better world as  opposed to always resisting and battling the things that are happening.    It   s  the major shift in the way that I   ve thought about things to    I   m going to  burn out,    but if I think about it like,    This is propelling me to create a better  place,    then I can sustain myself. I always think of that very significantly  because people tend to come together and say that we   re all Oklahomans,  but if you were a person of color at that time, you were not considered in the  comradery necessarily.  Students had to leave school from threats and things like that, and it became  part of a national narrative. It   s interesting how we had to feel the pain of  that happening in a different way because at some points you were not part  of    We are all coming together.    It   s like,    We   re not because you just beat  up people who look like me and tried to blame people who look like me for  something that we didn   t do.    One of my best friends at the time, we  decided to drive by the Murrah Building  in Oklahoma City . I don   t know  how long after it was, but we drove by. It was just curiosity of something of  that magnitude. We went and drove by, and we lasted five seconds. I, to this  day, have never felt death be so personified. That building was just hollow,  and you just felt it. We were like,    We   re leaving.    We couldn   t stay there,  but many years later I participated in, we did a half marathon for the  Oklahoma City Memorial with my dad. We ran it. It was interesting to be  back there.  30  Neurohr Were there students that you knew at OSU that left because of that?  Gonzales No. The students that I knew actually were at OU. Some of it gets what was  true and what was told to me. Those students did leave from OU, but then at  OSU, I remember being told that campus police told students, international  students in particular (maybe it was a certain group; I lived in the  international hall) to lay low for two weeks and not to come out. Yeah, it   s  that experience, and I was seeing all the media around it of what does it  mean to be safe if everybody nationally is like any brown person?    I was  someone, being multiracial and living in the international hall, people often  assumed I was Middle Eastern. My parents were just like,    You need to be  aware of your surroundings    and stuff like that. That   s the power of  oppression is that you sometimes don   t even have to explicitly have  someone tell you something, but you always have to think ahead of,    This is  a possibility of something happening.     Neurohr Was there a real strong sense of fear within the community of where you  were living because of the suggestion or the recommendation by the police?  Gonzales Yeah. On some level, you just don   t want to believe it, and when you   re  going through it, there   s so much misinformation and lack of information.  That almost always then, having experienced it so much breeds a violence,  when people don   t know the answer or they heard something so they   re  going to do something to somebody. You just become, it   s a reminder of  how precarious that your situation is because if somebody is drunk and  somebody is out and they see you and they decide that you   re Middle  Eastern, and if you are Middle Eastern, that whole situation changes for you.  It   s stupid of you to not know that, right, to be aware that you   re made to  have to do that from a very young age. Some people might not understand it  and be like,    No, we are all Oklahomans, and we came together.    I   m like,     It doesn   t look like that for everyone.    I had written about it recently, and  then what does that mean for the ways that we get to grieve and have trauma  because it   s not, we don   t get to heal in the same ways, right? We have to  think about it in other ways and no official apologies. The damage gets  done.  Having restudied racism for many, many years, the fact that it was reported  that Middle Eastern people were responsible for it, you cannot erase that. In  a courtroom where they   re like,    Strike that from the record,    they do it  because you know you can   t un-hear it, right? That   s it, even if it was found  out to be untrue or these two white men participated in it and did it. You can  never erase that thought about it, and it   s true for other things. We had a  mass shooting in Tucson, and it was a white man, a young white man who  did it, shot our congresswoman. I was in DC, and I always talk to the  cabbies of    What   s the feel in the area? Who are you? What do you do?     This guy was like,    Oh, you   re from Arizona. That   s where that Mexican  31  guy shot the congresswoman.    I was like,    You don   t even have to commit  the crime for people to accuse you of it.    It   s very pervasive. When things  like that do happen, it   s not like,    Well, no one told you.    You don   t have to.  I   m like,    You already have to bring that with you to   better safe than  sorry.    You know what I mean? Yeah, it was an interesting time.  Neurohr How did attending OSU impact your life?  Gonzales (Laughs) That   s a big question. (Laughs) Oh, I think it just really, it  provided a space for me to participate in ways that were very structured for  me before in high school, right, and there   s way less opportunities in high  school. To put opportunities in and value on things like leadership and all  these organizations around culture and identity and other things, to put value  alongside of that along with academics like,    This will help your academics.  This will help keep you here when things happen,    right? In high school, it   s  not, it   s just, you do your stuff, and that   s how I was allowed to participate.  Here it was like,    Oh, okay. This is not just a fun thing if you have time for  it.    There   s research to show we have these programs to keep students and  the students who come from different backgrounds in particular relate to  these kinds of things. For me, it was being very, very quiet growing up and  not very involved to being like, not only you can be involved but    Hey, just  come on.        We   re doing this. You could do this part. I see it in you already.    They   re  not even labeling. You may or may not interview. It   s just like,    You   re  cool. You   re here. Let   s go. You can do this.    I think having a container for  those bases was really critical for me to see myself as a leader and to do it  because otherwise I don   t know. I never would have thought I would be  president of the Hispanic Student Association. I think some of that, studying  identity for many years, it was being female, being a woman, being like,     I   ll do the historian.    I could have just gone for president, but I was like,     Well, let me get my feet wet first and see more what that looks like.    Then  you   re going up the ranks. Providing that opportunity to do so was really  important, and while there are many things that are inequitable on campus,  in facing those things, there were also a million opportunities where people  said,    Yes. Let   s do something like this    or    Let   s do it.     I had a friend, and we wanted to reach out to have more Latino students on  campus. We watched a lot of Oprah, and we were like,    Let   s just start our  own mentorship program.    We worked with office of admissions. I don   t  remember his name, but there was an African American man there who was  super cool with the students. He gave us the list of students in high school  who were thinking of applying. She had a family member who was in high  school. We created the Gonzales-Mar mentorship program, and we wrote a  letter. It was like,    We   re here. We   re Latina. We want you to be  successful,    and it was just including all the free stuff they gave to us,  32  application, brochures about OSU. We just sent them out. We   re like,    Call  us if you need anything.    It was short-lived, right, because we paid for  everything. (Laughs) The postage alone was a lot.  That person that she had already known had been like,    Oh,    considering  other places but then decided to come here, and he told us it was like,     Because I knew you, but now I know that you   re here and that there   s other  people and you   re looking out for me and that when I get there, I will have  someone to connect to.    It was like,    We have one person. Yeah     but just  the idea of being able to think that through and to have staff who would be  like,    We   re here to help. Here   s addresses. We   ll send them,    those things.  To have a place to percolate those ideas was all really valuable. Everything  really changed from high school and participating in places where I was told  to go and then being in college where it   s like,    You can do all of these  things    was just one of the strongest core elements for everything that I did  after.  Neurohr If you were to give advice to future students, what would it be?  Gonzales I guess the advice I typically think about is to be involved, to participate,  right, not just be like,    You should join some clubs because it looks good on  a resume    but to participate, and that might mean, with the, if you   re in the  residence halls, it might mean the people on your floor. Participate in that  because you don   t necessarily know where you might end up, and if you  take the first step, then the next step will illuminate. It   s not just being like,     I   m just going to stay over here.    It might be participate in that. It might be  participate in a formal organization, but try it.  You don   t have to stick with it, but there   s a lot that we don   t know that we  don   t know. The more that you just take steps in looking at different things,  then you   re like,    Oh, I never thought of myself as, I never, at this time,  would have ever thought I would have run my own business.    In my head,  that looked like a certain person, and that was not me. Participating in this  and that all led to me being able to do it, right? That would be my advice is  to keep, is to just participate in small and big ways, things that don   t, that are  not going to take you too far off course, and more than likely they   re going  to take you to a place that you didn   t realize you wanted to go.  Neurohr Do you have a poem that you would like to share for concluding the  interview?  Gonzales Not on me. I was thinking of that, had I thought of it earlier, to bring some,  some different things to read. Yeah. I don   t know if it is relatable enough,  but I can read the one about my friend.  Neurohr Can you give me some context for it?  33  Gonzales Yeah, absolutely. Part of it is I have a lot of friends that I   ve made along the  way, and I don   t have very many from growing up, which is a different time.  I ended up having much different experiences than the folks that I grew up  with, but one person (hopefully I have it somewhere) was Kim Jackson. We  were friends for a really long time in high school, middle school and high  school, in a variety of ways. She was back home. She would be the only  person that I would visit when I would return back home, and she ended up,  (she was a year younger than me) she ended up at OU. We would go and  visit her sometimes, especially when we had football games against OU,  hang out in her residence hall and be friends. Then she moved back home,  and she became ill. She had lupus very young and then had to have things  like a pacemaker put in and those kinds of things. It was difficult to be sick.  I would just always visit her and talk with her, and she was the one person  that I would have maintained contact with all these years. She passed away  in 2013, and it was probably the person closest to me that   s passed away  ever. I   ve been very fortunate in that regard.  It was a lot of lessons about life and growing up in Muskogee and the time  that I was at Oklahoma State and being able to visit her and seeing her  experience there and back and forth introducing her to folks. There was a  point in which the person that we went to the football games with, we  visited her. Both of them passed away already. It   s a reminder of that, to that  whole idea of participating and why it   s so crucial, that time is very fleeting  sometimes. I was very self-conscious as a young person in high school. I  really hated having my picture taken for some specific reasons. I just hated  it. I never really liked it, but then when I started college my freshman year,  out of nowhere I just had a thought that I   m going to want to remember this.  My memory is a little wacky. (Laughs) I   m like,    I   m going to document  everything.    I have scrapbooks from all my time at OSU, and it   s ticket  stubs and programs and flyers I made and all the O   Colly headlines,  everything that I was involved in and tons and tons of pictures. I just said,    I  don   t care if I don   t, if I look ugly in them, I   m just going to have them,     and it turned out to be the greatest gift because I met her, met her during  early move-in, my friend, Alicia. There   s a number of photographs of us for  everything.  We spent literally every day together. I have all those memories. I   m really  grateful for that. With Kim, I didn   t have the forethought to do that as much  in high school. I don   t have that as much, but I have some of our  conversations in my mind. This poem is related to that. It   s called For Best  Friends and Memories That Get Woven into Skin.    I   m not going to  remember your birthday. My mind can   t seem to wrap itself around time-framed  information like what year my parents got married or how long you  and I have known each other. Sometimes memories are fleeting. It made me  realize it   s not just timeframe memories that lie dormant in my head, but  34  rather, it   s just emotions that I do remember best. I have to rely on triggers  like watching the sunrise reflect gold across the clusters of dandelions in my  backyard making me smile, and then I   ll remember smiling there as weeds  hide their stems together wearing them like crowns. This is why now I take  a lot of pictures, why I talk a lot with people, why a good night out with  friends is actually a night staying in weaving recollections like tongues are  yarn, like hugs are knitting, like love is warmth. When Kim passed away, I  suddenly found myself holding a quilt of rapidly unraveling memories.        Every day ripped off the calendar meant another twenty-four hours from  the last time she and I spoke. The harder I try to recollect, the more my brain  erases her. Still I calm my mind and begin to remember, like the time Alicia  and I visited Kim at college just to brag about our football team   s win over  hers. I remember laughter until our sides hurt. Then my brain kicks in this  thought,    What if myself now could have told myself then I was going to  outlive them both before any of us turned forty? Would I have been more  diligent about taking pictures, forced more of those late-night  conversations?    Kimberly K. Jackson was a proud Choctaw and Creek  woman. She lived in Muskogee, Oklahoma, all her life. She loved her  Oklahoma Sooners and George Strait. She played the clarinet in band since  middle school, and that   s where we met. I   d known her twenty-three years.  Her birthday is January 26, 1977. She passed on a Tuesday in 2013. I can  recite these facts like it   s obituary trivia, but I miss memories. Each time I  come home, I wait patiently for sunrises to bring me stories, and I want to  promise that this time I won   t forget.     Neurohr Beautiful.  Gonzales Thanks. Thank you. It was really hard to read the first time that I did it  because I usually don   t. I haven   t done something so personal before. I was  like,    I   m going to test it out and see if it helps    because it was really hard.  Like I said, it was the first person that I had known very, very well to pass  away. I   m not sure if it helped, but it does make me feel good that her story,  in some version, is still being put out there.  Neurohr Yes. Yeah. Yeah. She won   t be forgotten.  Gonzales Nope. (Laughter) Soundproof unless someone   s hammering. (Laughter)  Neurohr Do you have anything else you would like to add in the interview as we close  up here?  Gonzales I guess being here during this time and having so much reflection that I am  grateful for staff who participated in constructing the programs that we have  here, that, as a student, I had no idea. You just think that things are here like     Oh, that   s cool,    but you don   t know behind the curtain. (Laughs) Being a  35  person behind the curtain now, I realize you have to do a lot of work,  whether it   s fighting for funding or just hours and hours of labor to be put  into something. I   m just really appreciative of all those people and staff at  Oklahoma State who were doing that at that time and continue to do it. It  makes a big difference. Then, too, my fellow students, at the time, for being  a generally really amazing group of people and being open to learning about  new people and being kind to each other and creating a family that showed  me that you can create a chosen family if you need to and if you want to. I  am really grateful for those folks who were here at that time, and thank you,  Oral History Project (it   s so important) and for your hospitality. I really  appreciate it.  Neurohr You   re very welcome. It   s been an honor to have you here for the program  and to have your influence with our students. It   s so important for them to  see people who have been here and where they are now, and just to be able  to help make that happen is really an honor and blessing for me.  Gonzales Thank you so much.  Neurohr You   re welcome. Well, thank you for the interview and for your time. I  appreciate it.  Gonzales Go pokes  (Laughter)  Neurohr Good conclusion. (Laughter)  -------  -------
