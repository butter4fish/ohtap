Story_ID: 128626
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm going to also ask you about your family history.  Let's start on your father's side.  Tell us what you can--what information you can give us about your, your father 'cause what does name start (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Well my father, his name was Vernis [ph.] Weaver [listed some places as Carl Weaver], Vernis Weaver and daddy had--the only brother I remember is Merle [ph.] and (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay his, his brother Merle spelled M-E-R-L-E?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Daddy was was a boxer, I understand.  He also was a musician and he also was a photographer.  And Daddy passed when I was in the fourth grade.  We had just come from St. Louis [Missouri] where he lived.  Daddy had cancer, and I remember Daddy being in pain, real pain.
Speaker 1: Coming back on the trip from St. Louis?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Or.
Speaker 2: At night he would, you know, he would be trying to sleep, and he would be in pain from the cancer.  And at the time, you know, treatment was not there nor did he have insurance.  But also I remember Daddy used to go to--in, in St. Louis there was a boat called the Admiral and at the time black folks could not go on the Admiral.  But Daddy was able to go on the Admiral because he was a photographer.  And so Daddy would go.  He would leave at night and go take pictures of the folks who were able to go on the Admiral (laughter).
Speaker 1: And he shared these stories with you.  What other stories did he share with you about his boxing exploits or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: He didn't, he didn't share those.  The time that I was with Daddy was short 'cause he and my mother [Mary Alice Robinson Buchanan] divorced.  And so, you know, didn't see that much or know that much about him but we would leave in the summer and go down to St. Louis.  And my grandmother [Bertha June Robinson] used to take us down to St. Louis, and it was--I mean those are times that I still remember because they had, they had some popsicles about that big.  Popsicles, the best popsicles you ever wanted to wrap your lips around.  There's no way.  Donuts--aw man but I guess something that we--I really remember was the baseball games you see, and it used to be that most of the St. Louis Cardinals games were held at night.  And some of the greatest games I saw were with the St. Louis Cardinals and the Brooklyn Dodgers. I was a little bitty kid, you know Jackie Robinson wore a cap and that stand (unclear).  It was, it was I didn't I didn't realize then what it was but it, it was really something, really something and then we'd ride the streetcars.  So, you know, but all of that and then we'd go to the zoo, St. Louis Zoo all right, but all those things were possible because my daddy lived in St. Louis.  And we were able to go down because grandmother  took us down there.
Speaker 1: Now those trips to St. Louis, I imagine those were in a car you drove down or--?
Speaker 2: In a car?  Who had a car, ha ha?
Speaker 1: Nobody.
Speaker 2: Jumped on the train.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's when we, we became very familiar with the St. Louis train station.  So we, we took--Grandma, Grandma she never could drive.  And I don't think Grandma had a car.  Granddaddy didn't have a car. Granddaddy got a car later on in life, but grandmother never drove.
Speaker 1: Now this grandmother and grandfather were your father's grandmother (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Mother's.
Speaker 1: Your mother's okay.  Okay, we're going to get to that.  During those early years making those trips did you make any trips while your father was alive to St. Louis?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah all of those things were that I just described were when he was living.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so we went we went down to see, went down to see him.
Speaker 1: Okay good, any other stories you can share with us that your father may have shared with you?
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 128627
Speaker 1: And you were four you said when, when he, [Weaver's father, Carl Vernis Weaver] he passed?
Speaker 2: No, in the fourth grade.
Speaker 1: Four--in the fourth grade.  Okay, so you were about nine years old.
Speaker 2: In fact we had just we had just come from visiting [in St. Louis, Missouri].  And we had been back in, in Danville [Illinois] about two or three days when we got word that he had passed away, and we had to go back.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay any other--anything else you can remember?  Sights or sounds on those trips to St. Louis [Missouri] or going down for the funeral or going down to visit your dad (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah I mean, I mean those were, those were some, some, you know, little bitty kids, you know, good days and it was hot.  And, and I don't know how we stood withstood the, the heat because, you know, when we think about today you put us in some heat.  And the first thing we say where's the air conditioning?  But back then we didn't have any air conditioning, you know, it was hot and, and, and sometimes we didn't even have a fan.  But we, but we (laughter) made it, you know.  So we'd go down to St. Louis.  There was this family that we, we usually hung out with, and it was interesting.  And in fact, a couple of the brothers who we hung out with back--way back then they're here in [Washington] D. C. now.  And I think they're connected with Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and but, you know, it was, it was good (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was good.
Speaker 1: Drop-riding on the train those days--we're talking about the early '40s [1940s] now when segregation was still an issue.  Do you remember any incidents of riding on the train, trains station?
Speaker 2: No I don't remember.  All I remember is getting on and getting off.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And getting off at the St. Louis train station.  I mean it was, it was and, and again today, and I just passed that train station two weeks ago, and it's always a remembrance of the past.  But it's, it's a good remembrance.  But I don't, I don't remember, you know, the segregation and so forth that possibly was there.  And if it was there grandmother [Bertha June Robinson] probably shielded us from it.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  You know, but you do remember those great big popsicles (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Heck yes.
Speaker 1: And those donuts?
Speaker 2: Grape, grape pop--and, and to this day I look for hot donuts all right.  I mean they, they were they were good they were, they were absolutely just marvelous, marvelous (laughter).
Story_ID: 128628
Speaker 1: Let's, let's go back to your mother's family now and let's start with your mother's name?
Speaker 2: Mary Alice Robinson Buchanan.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Robinson was her maiden name.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have any history on her family, her mother [Bertha June Robinson] and father [Dewey Robinson]?
Speaker 2: West Virginia they were, they were I think they were rooted in West Virginia.  And, and my grandmother and my great-grandmother--we, we when, when we had our kids at the time they were born we had five generations.  You know, and somewhere, there's a picture of all five generations, you know, which was really something at the time.  And so we were raised in large part, you know, you talk about extended family.  Well, that we really did have extended family because my mother and, and father [Carl Vernis Weaver] had divorced.  And so we stayed a lot with her grandparents, and so we stayed there until mama remarried.  But Grandmother, she worked for, for some white folks, an attorney in town.  Did what they call day work.  And she worked, she worked there for a long time long time.  And I remember, I remember when we (laughter) used to go, you know, saw--you looked at the big houses I mean they had a big house.  And sometimes when, when they were out of town we would go to the big house.  You know, we'd go and we'd just, just run around and play.  Grandmother would cook, and it was, it was it's interesting times, but I have to say that if you fast-forward, when I, when I got ready to go to college and needed a job then this attorney, you know, he helped me get a job because during that time it was very difficult for black folks to get jobs in town.  And so you had to know somebody in order to get a job.  And so Grandmama she, she played a very significant role in our lives.  And, and, in fact, the house that, that she lived in is still there.  And we, we still own it.  And Granddaddy and he, his name was Dewey Robinson.  Dewey General Robinson (laughter) and granddaddy, he--Granddaddy ended up working at the veterans hospital.  And he was, he was a good man now if, if you come in to take Grandmama's June, Bertha June Robinson was her name (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Bertha June, J-U-N-E.
Speaker 2: J-U-N-E, Bertha June Robinson, and her folks, her great-grandparents were, you know, I had it right-- (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Go ahead with that.
Speaker 2: Robinson.  Well it'll come (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, but great-grandmother, she I think she was unemployed for the most part because she took care of great-granddaddy [James R. Brown].  And great-granddaddy, I'm told that great-granddaddy, great-granddaddy used to be rich. He used to be rich.  But the depression came, and he lost everything, but he was, he was connected and worked for John L. Lewis.  And so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Let's talk about John L. Lewis.
Speaker 2: John L. Lewis you got it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Lee (simultaneous) Coal Mine United [sic, United Mine Workers of America]?
Speaker 2: You right Coal Mine, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and Granddaddy, I remember grandmother they had, they had--Granddaddy used to work in the mines. And, and Granddaddy would, would go to work early in the morning and, and Grandmama, she would, she would have these big old canisters like that was their lunchbox.  Big old canister like that, you know, and Granddaddy would go off to the mines.  And then, and then he would come back at the end of the evening he'd just be black as coal black as coal, you know.  And we never, we never recognized the significance of what was going on there.  So (unclear), you know, and the and the train that picked him up, you know, it was about, it's 'bout not too far away. We'd go down there all the time.  The train'd come by and pick him up; he'd get on, go on to work, and then come on back home.
Story_ID: 128629
Speaker 1: And but, but great-granddaddy was, was associated with, with that, and so Mr. Brown, Mr. Brown was his name James R. Brown (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Great-granddaddy James R. Brown.
Speaker 1: Great-granddaddy James R. Brown.
Speaker 2: All right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Baddest, baddest.  James R. Brown, he was bad.  He was cripple and he had a bald head.  I think he had a gold tooth and he liked good things, liked good things.  And, and great-grandmother she, she was she, she was all right.
Speaker 2: What was her name?
Speaker 1: It's coming (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, okay that's okay when it comes we're--the now are we talking about them living in (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: In Danville [Illinois].
Speaker 2: In Danville?
Speaker 1: In Danville.
Speaker 2: Not in West Virginia?
Speaker 1: And then in West Virginia, grandmother, grandmother Bertha June [Robinson], grandmother, she took us she took me down to West Virginia.  And because we--it was Beckley, West Virginia.  We wanted to see where, you know, great-grandparents and so forth where they had grown up.  And so we went to Beckley and saw some of the folks but the experiences I'm talking about were in Danville.
Speaker 2: Okay did anyone ever tell you about how your great granddad became--was injured so that he was crippled (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (shaking his head no) I don't know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I think, I think one leg may have been shorter than the other.
Speaker 2: Okay, so it was a natural (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Crip, crippling in, in them (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: When--obviously I wanted to get the full place of birth in West Virginia at we--?
Speaker 1: For them?
Speaker 2: For, for the--for your great-grand--
Speaker 1: I think it was Beckley [West Virginia].
Speaker 2: B-E-C-K-L-E-Y?
Speaker 1: B-E, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah Beckley, B-E-C-K yes.
Speaker 2: Beckley, West Virginia.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, any other, any stories that you're because your grandparents raised you to a certain extent--?
Speaker 1: Yeah I know my grandmother did and the extended family.
Speaker 2: And extended family.
Speaker 1: We were, we were in a neighborhood and, in fact, the neighborhood where we grew up is still the neighborhood where my mother [Mary Alice Robinson]  lived until she passed.  And, and those houses, you know, we still have those.  And, and, you know, you know, some things happen in your life that you remember.  And to show you how a family is extended and how they have an impact on you as, as you are raised.  I remember it seems like it was yesterday it was, it was a very overcast morning.  And my mama was fixing to go to work, and we had, we had outhouses and, and Ms. Thurman [ph.] across the field.
Speaker 2: That was the neighbor?
Speaker 1: Ms. Thurman, yes, Ms. Thurman yelled out across the field she said, "Mary Alice, Reggie sassed me."  Now I didn't sass Ms. Thurman but, you know, what it didn't matter.  If Ms. Thurman said it, my mother believed it and, and I got it all right.  But when I go back home, and I talk to the folks back there.  I always recognize the extended family because my mother was working, you know, the grandparents worked.  And so it was that extended family that helped to raise me, and so I always acknowledge them.  And always to the extent that I can go by their house when I go home because they can cook (laughter).
Speaker 2: Fried chicken?
Speaker 1: (Nodding head yes) and, and every--and, and as the kids say, "E'erthing else" (laughter).
Speaker 2: All right.
Story_ID: 128630
Speaker 1: Let's, let's get a good picture of Danville [Illinois], approximately size of Granville (?), some of the-- (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Danville, Danville is approximately 39,000 people now.  It's a, it's a--an area that has lost a lot of industry. General Motors used to be the big employer there. And all most everybody worked all the men worked in General Motors making--made good money.  Hyster used to have a plant there.  [Bunge/] Lauhoff now Lauhoff Grain [later Bunge Milling] is the main manufacturing company there now.  And they've just taken they've just taken over almost all, all of the area that, that we used to frequent.  They're not, there's not much that is there now.  And the population and again you have well there's a prison there--that's there now and a veterans hospital.  But there's not much there to go back to.
Story_ID: 128631
Speaker 1: Okay, let's go back a little ways to your siblings.  You had several siblings the oldest one down to the youngest one could you give us their names (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I have three brothers.  The oldest is Karl [Weaver], Karl lives in Indianapolis [Indiana].  Next is Dewey Buchanan and other one is the last one in the group is Mike Buchanan.  Mike and Dewey came from mom [Mary Alice Robinson Buchanan], mama's second marriage to Palestine [ph.] Buchanan.  And Dewey lives in Minneapolis [Minnesota], and Mike lives in Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay, now were you the oldest child?
Speaker 2: Second.
Speaker 1: Second.
Speaker 2: Karl, Reg, Dewey and Mike.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay and when, when you remember approximately the date when your mother remarried to Mr. Buchanan?
Speaker 2: (shaking his head no) I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, have no idea?
Speaker 2: We were--I remember, I don't I don't know the date but it happen I think it may have been in the fourth grade [approx. 1949].  Because I remember when daddy [Carl Vernis Weaver] passed mama--we were living in the house over on Williams Street.  And, and mama had married Eenie [ph.]--we would call him Eenie Palestine--she had married Eenie then, and so I know it had to be sometime third or fourth grade-- (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --That I was in.
Story_ID: 128632
Speaker 1: Let's go back and take a look at your schooling growing up there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: You know I was just about ready to say that.
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: The when, see when, when we lived with Grandmama [Bertha June Robinson] we went to Cannon [Elementary] school [Danville, Illinois].  It was, it was a good school, you know, and it was, it was predominantly white.  And I can, I can remember man the first day I went to school.  I had, I had just gotten a cowboy suit.  Man, I had the cowboy hat, I had the, the vest, I had these guns, you couldn't tell me I wasn't bad, man (laughter).  I went up in that school, you know, and then it was a very good experience.  Ms. Supple was my first-grade teacher.
Speaker 1: How do you spell her (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: S-U-P-P-L-E, she was my first-grade teacher she was a good, and one thing Ms. Supple did if you messed up she would pinch you.  Always remember that.  And then I went to the--there in second grade and the third grade.  And then mama [Mary Alice Buchanan] married, remarried to Eenie [Palestine Buchanan].  And then we moved from grandma's house over to another part of the town which meant that we could no longer go to Cannon School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had to go to Jackson [Elementary] School which was a segregated school, all black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we went there--I went there for fourth grade and my teacher there--it was a combination class third and fourth grade.  My teacher name was Ms. Jackson, Ms. Jackson (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Ms. Jackson of Jackson Elementary?
Speaker 2: No, no (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, I'm sorry (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, Ms. Jackson at Jackson School, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and she was, she was good she was good and had a good experience there.  And then fifth grade, Ms. Morton [ph.] was her name, Ms. Morton.  And Ms. Morton lived right down the street from Grandma so, so we would see her, and she was I think she was married to, to a doctor, Dr. Lewis [ph.].  And so we would, we would be able to, to see Ms. Morton.  You know, you're talking about a teacher living in the same neighborhood with you (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: All right, and so that, that's what happened.  So Ms. Morton was a good teacher as well but for some reason, you know, we didn't, we didn't like it as well as Cannon.  So we kinda got to talk with my mama--"Mama we want to go back to Cannon School."  So, just so happened that mama [Mary Alice Robinson Buchanan] and [Palestine] Eenie [Buchanan], they bought a house two doors down from grandma's [Bertha June Robinson] house.  So when we got a chance to move back from Williams Street back to Johnson Street where we had grown up.  So we were able to go back to Cannon School.  So went back to sixth grade there, and the teacher was Mr. Meyers [ph.].  And Mr. Meyers he was a good teacher but, but Mr. Meyers he, you know, he, he started to do these caricature things.  You know, like yeah talking like, you know, black folks and, and (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Mr. Meyers was white?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Actually, I only in my whole schooling, all the schooling that I have had I've only had Ms. Jackson and Ms. Morton as black teachers.  All the rest of the teachers been whites all and--in all my schooling.
Speaker 1: Okay so.
Speaker 2: K through G.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, you, you know, and, you know, you're like shuffling and, and, you know, six grade.  I used to think it was funny, you know, and I'd just laugh I'd be, I'd be the loudest one (laughing)--
Speaker 1: All the rest of the students in the class--
Speaker 2: Were white.
Speaker 1: --Were white yeah.  Gotcha.
Speaker 2: (nodding head yes) And, and then one day after Mr. Myers had done that I'll never forget name was Johnny Boyd, he said, "Reg, why you laughing?  That ain't funny."  You know what, I never laughed again and I don't know whether Mr. Meyer did it anymore.  But also another thing that happened when I was going to Cannon School, and I was this high (gestured height by hand).  I-it, it was this, this guy, you know, and, and he was an older guy and he'd see me and he'd say, "Hi little black Sambo."  I say, "hey little say hey little black Sambo."  And so every time he would see me that's how he would address me, "hey, little black Sambo."  And then one day my mother was with me.  And he didn't do it, and I say, "hey little black Sambo," he said "hey little black Sambo."  And that's when my mother said, "what are you doing?"  You know, so that was something else that my mother--
Speaker 1: Now this was, was this prior to the move to Jackson were you in a younger (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, that was prior to the move.
Speaker 1: Yes okay.
Speaker 2: That was the first, the first thing in Jack--at Cannon [Elementary] School.
Story_ID: 128633
Speaker 1: But, and then and in seventh grade and eighth grade at Cannon [Elementary School, Danville, Illinois] they were good they were they were really good.  I think there were out of the graduating class I think there may have been about seven of us seven blacks. And, and, also the--I wanted to play basketball we had a basketball team.  When I when, I was in (laughter) when I was in the sixth grade.  Where they used to have I don't know, I don't know what it was but they use to have baton twirlers.  I wanted to twirl a baton, so I tried (laughter) to get mama [Mary Alice Buchanan] to buy me a baton, you know, so I could be a part of the baton twirlers, you know.  But mama wouldn't get me no baton so I couldn't twirl it, you know.  And then I wanted to play basketball.  And so I, I--the coach the guy that was coaching he told me.  He said, "Reg, ain't no need in you going out for basketball 'cause you ain't gone make the team."
Story_ID: 128634
Speaker 1: Okay, let's finish that story about your wanting to try out for the basketball team.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, you know, since I, since I couldn't (laughter) twirl since I couldn't twirl a baton.  I said well maybe I'll run, maybe I'll play basketball.  And so, you know, I got out there I, you know, I guess the, the coach had seen me play in gym.  And so he told me he said, "Look here, Reg, ain't no need of you coming out for the basketball team because you ain't no--you can't make it," you know.  I said dang, you know, didn't even give me a chance didn't give a brother a chance.  So I said, "Well can I be manager," you know.  So I think I was the manager but, but I was at Cannon [Elementary] School [Danville, Illinois], and that was good.  But the grade school I think there were about there were about seven or eight grade schools in town.  And, and they had football, teams.  And Jackson School [Danville, Illinois], which was all black school where I had come from, they had, they had a bad--man they had a team called the Rams, man (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Elementary school (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Wait, wait no it was the Bears.  It was the Bears, and that's what made it, you know, they had these, the--had these black helmets and black--they were good they were good.  And, and some of the guys that played on that team, you know, I remember, and one of the guys that played on the team his name was Robert Hunter.  And he has the--he's a barber 53rd and Ellis [in Chicago, Illinois]--he was bad, he was bad.  And I, and I mentioned Robert because number one, he, he's still my barber.  But that barbershop is located in an area, and Hunter has had all kinds of celebrities to come through that barbershop.  And I remember going to the barbershop and Hunter used to always talk to me about, "You ever heard of [HM] John Hope Franklin?"  I said no.  He said, "I cut John Hope's hair yesterday, you know."  But I mean he--and, and I saw John Hope's son a couple weeks ago.  And he had been to the barbershop and talked to Hunter.  And, and when they had the, the anniversary of the Brown versus Board [of Education  of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483, 1954] it was, it was one of my first times at seeing and John Hope.  And I said I mentioned John Hope I mean I mentioned Hunter to John Hope, and he said, "Oh Lord, Hunter."  Hunter is one of these cats, you know, every, every other word is a curse word.  But, but, but if you want a comedian, he would be the person to get to be the, the comedian that everybody would love, and everybody would laugh, but he's good.  And, and when you go into his barbershop it's just like going into a museum where there is black paraphernalia, you know.  So if you all ever get a chance 53rd and Ellis is Brown's Barbershop and, and Hunter took over the barbershop from Mr. Brown.  Mr. Brown one evening he went home and was parking his car in the garage and got killed and so Hunter took, took over.  But, but see I used to be president of the Illinois Education Association and every--before every-and, and I used to have to chair this meeting.  And but before every meeting I would go to the barbershop to get uplifted, you know.  And Mr. Brown he would say Reggie now when you get around all them white folks you can't do all that old loud laughing.  You can't (screaming) ha, ha you can't do all that, he say what you gotta do is (covered mouth snickering), (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But, but I would get grounded then I'd go down and chair this meeting, and so everything worked out all right.  But the eighth grade seven--out of seven blacks I think that graduated I think it was only two of us that graduated from high school.
Speaker 1: Only two (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Two, two out of seven yep.
Speaker 1: Out of seven?
Speaker 2: Yep.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's any more stories from Cannon before we move on to high school?
Speaker 2: No, Cannon no I think that's about it, it was a good, good, you know, good school.  The theme song that (singing), "Everyone that goes to Cannon School goes out to obey each and every rule, they got this smile that style that living way no matter where you go you'll recognize 'em and you'll (unclear)," that was the song (laughter).
Speaker 1: Alright. Alright.
Story_ID: 128635
Speaker 1: Some of these sounds and smells that, that come out of your neighborhood as well as the school.  You've told us about some of the teachers that you particularly admired both at Jackson [School, Danville, Illinois] and--
Speaker 2: Cannon [Elementary School, Danville, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Cannon but let's, let's talk about that, that neighborhood when you went home in the evening or--?
Speaker 2: It, it actually it was a, it was a good neighborhood it was, it was truly a family of neighbors who looked out for each other.  The kids we, we all had a good time together.  Every, every Sunday we used to have football games it was my brother [Karl Weaver] and the Davises and, and the Tylers and the Robinsons they, you know.  We had, you know, you talk about Super Bowl.  Every Sunday night was the Super Bowl and, and we'd play in our front yard.  But, and the Marches--but it was, it was a good neighborhood a good neighborhood we didn't have much, but we had each other, and that meant a lot.
Speaker 1: And some of these smells that and sounds that came out of there were--?
Speaker 2: Well there wasn't, there wasn't too much sound, wasn't too much sound because during that time very few had TVs, or they were just beginning to get TVs.  And TVs I can remember, remember the first TV that granddaddy [Dewey Robinson] got.  He was the first one to get a TV, black and white.  But in order to make it a color TV, you know, we got this paper that we put (laughter) right here.  The paper was blue at the top for the sky, and the yellow in the middle and then the green for the grass and that was our color TV.  But I do remember granddaddy he always used to listen, man, we could not move when Gabriel Heatter came on [the radio].  Gabriel Heatter came on you--shh--granddaddy said everything, everything stops, you know.   So those were some of the times and, and we had, we had in, in our house granddaddy's house we had a we had a fruit orchard.  We had cherries, we had pears, apples, apricots, grapes I mean it was something man.  And we would always wait for the summer to come so that we could get some of those cherries so Grandmama [Bertha June Robinson] could make a cherry pie or the green apples so we can eat em with some salt.  And they would always tell you gone get the flux if you eat them green apples, you know, but they were good.  But I also remember going to the store Gus Folks [ph].  Bread was a nickel, milk may have been three cents, you know.  And we use to go get cigarettes for, for grandma and them they was about a dime, you know, I sh-those were the days, those were the days.  And then we used to have chickens and on Sunday granddaddy used to go out and ring and ring the chicken's neck.  You know, clean it and that's what we have for, for dinner, you know, but it was(simultaneous).
Speaker 1: It was always chicken on Sunday?
Speaker 2: Chicken but you talking 'bout smells man. Grandmama on Sunday morning before we go to church grandmother used to always cook, cook these pancakes or sausage for my brother and hamburger--no sausage for me and hamburger for my brother.  They were good.  And today when I make pancakes I still make 'em like grandma made 'em, alright.
Story_ID: 128636
Speaker 1: And also the cherries--the guy, a guy that works here, his name is Michael Kahn [ph.].  He invited me out to his house for a party he was having, and they had a cherry tree.  Now, you know, I had to get me some of those cherries.  And, and they were so good the next day I called him back and said look here can I come out to get some more cherries.  And so they, they said we'll bring you some.  So they brought me some cherries, and, you know, what I did I made me a cherry cobbler.  And, and it brought back memories of how grandma's [Bertha June Robinson] cherry cobbler taste.  I see your lips like that (licking lips) I know you wish you had (laughter).  But, you know, all of those things help remind you of the things that, that happened, you know.  And then grandmama she said the one thing the one thing back then you, you would always be able to count on a breakfast and a dinner every day.  Grandmama worked day work at the Carters then grandma cooked every day she came home, but when Granddaddy [Dewey Robinson] came from the mines Granddaddy expected to have a meal.  And Grandmama always had a hot meal for him, and it was, it was good too, homemade biscuits man, you know.  Now the one thing that she used to have that I, I just could not get into granddaddy used to eat--aw shoot.  He ate something that I just I didn't understand why he like that it was a little round ball like a--it's like, it's like grits today--hominy, hominy (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: And Granddaddy used to like that hominy.  And I'd say, oh Lord, I don't know how he does that but it but it was good.  And then in the evening, you know, Granddaddy, Granddaddy had his seat here and, and the rest of us we sat there.  Grandmama, Grandmama played the piano she play the piano in church, you know.  And had a big old piano there and I, and I use to bang on the piano couldn't play nothing but just bang on the piano.  We had two bedrooms we had two bedrooms and, you know, as, as tight as it was we always made it.
Story_ID: 128637
Speaker 1: Let's, let's talk about the Sundays there and church service (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah we (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Was it mandatory that you go to church every (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Try not going, you know, oh yeah that was, that was one thing you had to do.  And Grandmama [Bertha June Robinson] would have somebody to pick us up because we didn't have no car.  Somebody'd pick us up.
Speaker 1: How far did you have to go to church?
Speaker 2: It was, it was a little ways it was a little ways.  But it just so happened that living on Johnson Street where we lived when we went to when we went to high school we had to walk.  So we, we walked a long way and, and the place where the high school was, was not too far from where the church was Second Baptist Church.  In fact, that's still the only church home that I have today is Second Baptist.
Speaker 1: You still go back today?
Speaker 2: I do. I do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we go to church on Sunday; Grandmama played.  And good services, good services.
Speaker 1: Was, was it was it all day or just (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: No, no we didn't--now that's one thing about our church we didn't have all day services no we, we was out by noon.
Story_ID: 128638
Speaker 1: Let's go on from, from there, oh let me cover some of your friends in the neighborhood.  Now you told us about your siblings but (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: How 'bout some of your great ace boon coons there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Davises, Clarence Albert and Doc and then you had Ronnie March, and then you had Terry Tyler, Terry and [Duane] "Dujie" Tyler.  Terry and Dujie, they are the sons of, of one of my mother's [Mary Alice Buchanan]  best friends [Marguerite Thurman Tyler] who still live there today.  And Doc and Clarence Albert, you know, both of their parents have passed.  And Ronnie, his parents have passed.  So we were, we were very good friends very--and I saw Doc a couple three weeks ago.  Got an email from Ronnie a couple of days ago so.  And, and Terry and Dujie were having some, some work done on the houses down home and they were very instrumental in helping there so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that connect, that connection is still there.
Story_ID: 128639
Speaker 1: Now we can move on to high school.  First I want to ask you one more question while at Cannon [Elementary School, Danville, Illinois].  How would you describe yourself as a good student, fair?
Speaker 2: I was, I was a good student. I was, I wasn't an 'A' student, but I was a good student.  And because that's one thing that my parents [Mary Alice Buchanan and Palestine Buchanan] and grandparents [Bertha June Robinson and Dewey Robinson] insisted, that you do your work and you get good grades. So--
Speaker 1: Okay, so you moved on to high school successfully?
Speaker 2: Moved on to high school, 1957 went into high school.
Speaker 1: All right.  And--
Speaker 2: It was--
Speaker 1: The name, all right, give, give me the name of the high school?
Speaker 2: Danville High School [Danville, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were living on, we were living on Williams when we first started.  And so we went to the high school freshman and, and see my parents, my parents were, were kind of strict.  And it was their expectation that, you know, you know, you had this time frame, and their expectation is that you were home.  Now if you stepped out of that time frame, they want to know why.  So time for us to be home from school was no later than a quarter to four, four o'clock.  And if we went beyond that then my mother--she worked at nights and my stepfather Eenie [Palestine Buchanan], you know, he wanted to know, you know, where you were.  See my mother [Mary Alice Buchanan], my mother worked at night; she worked at General Electric.  And she worked at night, so a lot of times, as we were coming up she was not there because she was working.  And so if we weren't at, if we weren't at home in that timeframe--and then my brother, I remember one time he went to a party.  And he was, he was not home by midnight.  My mother went to the party and got him, you know.  Those were things that, you know, we just didn't do.  So the freshman year it was, it was all right.
Speaker 1: Your freshman high school year?
Speaker 2: But all throughout high school I never took one science course, not one.  Math, I took algebra and geometry.  Geometry was a killer; I could not get geometry but--
Speaker 1: How about math and general math how did you do with that?
Speaker 2: It was all right.  General math and, and algebra was fine.  I just couldn't do geometry.  I had four years of Spanish and, and in my sophomore year decided I was going go out for wrestling.  My cousin was on the wrestling team, and I decided that I was going to wrestle as well.  So I went out for wrestling.  And by the time I was a senior I did pretty good, did pretty good (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: You had given up all ambitions of ever being a star football player (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Actually, actually I never had a desire to play football even in, in grade school.  I didn't play too much football, but I just admired those Bears at Jackson School, you know.  But then that was basketball where they didn't let me play in, in at Cannon [Elementary] School.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: But I was, I was small I was, I was little. And that's one of the things that folks used to make fun of me, you know, little runt, you know.  And so I was really too little to play anything.  And that's one of the reasons why I went out for wrestling because in wrestling it's an individual sport and different weights and so I, I did excel there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You had said before a number of the seven black students at Cannon never made it through graduating from high school.  What were some of the factors that played into their dropping along the wayside?
Speaker 2: I think family situations I think a couple of them may have gotten pregnant.  Couple of the girls may have gotten pregnant.  The boys, I don't know.  I think actually there were only two boys, me and Junior, and the girls were Karen, Shirley, and Boonie [ph.].  There was five of us.  And Karen, she was a good student I don't know, I don't know what happened to Karen.  Shirley, I think Shirley--I don't know I think the ones that grad--Boonie went to Schlarman High [sic, Schlarman Academy, Danville, Illinois].  That was a Catholic high school.  We had two high schools in Danville [Illinois], Danville High and Schlarman High, Schlarman was the Catholic school.  I think Boonie went to the Catholic school and I, I think Boonie graduated but the others I don't think they did.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 128640
Speaker 1: How about some of the teachers there in Danville High School [Danville, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't, I don't remember that many but I do--there, there are a couple three.  One was Ms. Stern [ph.].  She was my Spanish teacher; she was good.  And she saw that I was good and after three years of Spanish I wanted to take French; she said, "No, you're not taking French; you're taking your fourth year of Spanish."  Then there was Ms. Watkins [ph.], Ms. Watkins was the history teacher.  Ms. Watkins tried to get me to be a part of what they called the Wranglers Club.  The Wranglers Club was a club that did speaking.  I said "Oh no, not the kid."  If, if I would've tried to do public speaking, my friends would have dogged me out.  So I said no I'm not gone do that.  And then there was Mr. Sanders [ph.], Mr. Sanders was my junior homeroom teacher.  And he tried to get me to take chemistry.  I said, "Oh no, it is too hard; I am not taking chemistry."  He, he begged me; I said oh no, no. He was clean, but he was, he was a sharp--he was clean, he was clean, you know.  So I never, I never took any science no science at all in high school and didn't participate in the Wranglers Club.  So what did I do with my dumb life?  Teach science and speak a lot publicly (laughter).
Speaker 1: But the--all of those teachers by the way at Danville were white?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay, and Danville was the only public high school--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --There?
Speaker 2: Now it's, it's, you know, it's really interesting how things unfold.  Today right now, a number of years ago Danville High School--they established a wall of fame.  And my mother [Mary Alice Buchanan] was one of the first to be inducted into the wall of fame.  Along with, get this, Gene Hackman, Bobbie [Robert] Short, Dick Van Dyke, Jerry Van Dyke all those guys were from Danville, all right.  And my mother, you know, she knew these guys and then a few years later I was inducted into the wall of fame.  And so when my mother passed one of the things that we did on the way to the church we went to the high school.  Because I had never seen it we went to the high school to see the wall of fame.  And, you know, a picture of my mom and what she had done, and then you got a picture of me plastered all over there, so it was, it was interesting (laughter).
Story_ID: 128641
Speaker 1: That is interesting because it makes me realize that we need to go back and take a look at your, your mom [Mary Alice Buchanan].  Give us what she was like.
Speaker 2: Mom was something.  She was, she, she was--she never graduated from college, but mama was always one that wanted to make sure that education stayed in the forefront. She worked at--again as I indicated General Motors--General Electric at night.  And then after she retired from General Electric she was always--we was always affiliated with the one recreational center we had in town; it was the Laura Lee Fellowship House.  Laura Lee Fellowship House, mama, was always affiliated with that and then later on in her career--she became, she became a Head Start Director.  She became a Head Start Director.  And, and as she, as she wound down her career she was Head Start Director for three counties [in Illinois]: Vermillion County, Champaign County and Holston County and that was a person that never graduated from college.  And she had, she had--she was, she was--mama believed in working with people and establishing the work of people and, and she passed that on, you know, to us, you know it was very, very important.  So she was stellar in the community, a stellar in the community.
Speaker 1: And in you said she was Head Start for three counties.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So that meant she was a State Head Start Director.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And I never forget my first, first boy [Reginald Von Weaver] we would, we would send him down to Danville [Illinois] to be in this program, this Head Start program.  You know, he wasn't supposed to be there, but we sent him on down there.  That's why I believe that preschool is so important today because I do believe that the preschool experience that he got in the Head Start Program had a significant impact on his education.
Story_ID: 128642
Speaker 1: We need to talk about your stepfather [Palestine "Eenie" Buchanan] a little bit all, also. I'm sure-- (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Eenie was, Eenie was all right.  He, he was not as forceful of a, of a person but, you know, his presence was always known.  He was, he was kind of easy-going but he, you know, he, he'd get that juice in him and he, he get to acting crazy, you know.  But the one thing the one that thing that got us closer I think, I think there were some occasions when he was abused verbally by, by some folks in the family.  And really it really, it really angered me.  But the thing that I think really got us closer was, was, you know, got that--I don't know what I don't know if he got that juice in him or what.  And I was, I was maybe freshman or sophomore in high school and see by this time I'm, I'm wrestling, so I'm thinking I'm bad too.  But, but he had, he had started to, to physically abuse my mom [Mary Alice Buchanan].  And, and it had happened before, but nobody ever said--I never said anything; my brothers never said anything.  And this one time I think he was, he was about ready to beat her, and I went and grabbed him.  And I'll never forget, we were face-to-face in the front room.  He had hollered and, I'm, I'm just standing there.
Speaker 1: He had been drinking or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I, I--you see I don't know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But all I know, he was he was abusing mom and I wasn't having it no more.  And so he and, and the reason I remembered, you know, I was scared, I was a child, I was scared.  And then I remember the floors, you know, we had these old wooden floors and man my legs were--you could hear the floor shaking, you really could, you know.  But ever since that time but see he never he never hit me, and he never tried and ever since that time I think we grew closer.  We grew closer because I think it was a respect that was established that never had been established.  And so he was he was a good supporter, and so I didn't call him stepfather, I called him father.
Speaker 1: Oh and I was--that was my next question I was wondering whether you called him Eenie or the children called him Eenie--?
Speaker 2: Everybody, everybody called him Eenie.  Everybody, everybody in town called him Eenie.  They didn't call him Palestine.  They called him Eenie (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay but the children called him?
Speaker 2: Eenie.
Speaker 1: Oh they called him Eenie?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, good to know.  Let's, let's go on.  And did we establish Eenie--where, where he worked and (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: General Motors.
Speaker 1: He, he worked at General Motors.
Speaker 2: General Motors making all that big money (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay and (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: And, and when he retired, you know, the good insurance that they have.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the family ate well and so forth (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: We always ate well whether we had money or not.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Story_ID: 128643
Speaker 1: Let's, let's go back to high school.  You're wrestling on the high s--Danville High School [Danville, Illinois] wrestling team. How did you do how well did you do and did--
Speaker 2: Sophomore year I was in learning, junior year I continue to learn, and in senior year I made the team.  And I was, I was mediocre and but when I got to college, I really got good.
Speaker 1: So you continued in college?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah I got, got real good in college, yep.
Speaker 1: Let's--did this impact your studying in high school at all?
Speaker 2: Naw, now keep in mind if you lived in the house with mama [Mary Alice Buchanan] and Eenie [Palestine Buchanan] you had, you had to make sure had them grades (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we did.  But I, but I wanted to get the grades, you know.  It was; it was important that, that I do well for me.  And if I did well for me then I would do well for mom and grandma and everybody else.
Speaker 1: And when you graduated from Danville High, were there any special awards of recognition of your scholarship or--?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't that good, no I wasn't that good (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: I just, I just did well enough to get my diploma and get out of there.  But, but there was one significant--see being on the wrestling team and being in, in some of these classes with some of these kids, mostly white.  You know, I thought we had established pretty decent relationships.  So graduation we were lined up in the gym, you know, about to practice and, you know, there're all kinds of parties that happen during graduation.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, and these, some of these white kids invited me to this party.  And one kid that I thought his name was, his name was (pause), I, I know his name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 128644
Speaker 1: Okay, okay you're about to graduate from Danville High School [Danville, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and the parties were going on and, you know, you know, being--thinking that you're friends with these kids and they friends with you.  Black kids they ain't having no parties, you know, but white kids, you know, money folks rich folks they were having some parties.  So they invited me and this one kid that I thought was my friend he heard it and he did a U-turn.  And went over and asked them what the heck you doing. And just like I was invited I was uninvited, and that was, that was really a--
Speaker 1: A hurtful experience.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Weren't it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah but a learning experience, a learning experience.
Speaker 1: I know you have never forgotten it obviously?
Speaker 2: Heck no, heck no but, but they had a--we had a football, team.  And we had--there were, there were two guys, two black guys one little one big.  One, one's name was Melvin Lewis [ph.] that was a big fullback, and the other's name was Joe Darnell [ph.].  They called him "The Bullet" because he was so fast, you know.  And so we'd have, you know, Friday nights we had football games and, of course, all of us went to the football games.  And of course, we didn't watch the football games we played football on the side, you know, but it was, it was exciting times.
Speaker 1: All right, and was that a good team that you had there?
Speaker 2: We was, we was fair.
Speaker 1: But not as good as the Jackson [Elementary School, Danville, Illinois] team?
Speaker 2: Not (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Oh the ones, not Jackson (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Not as good as the Bears (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Not as good as the Bears (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: No, no (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, but you did, you did graduate any memorable experiences?  Your parents [Mary Alice Buchanan and Palestine "Eenie" Buchanan] were proud of you certainly.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, but again it wasn't anything like happens today when parents, you know, kid graduates from eighth grade and they give them a car, you know.  But it was an expectation that you do it.  It weren't it wasn't anything big, you know, that was, that was the expectation that you graduate, you know, so anyway it was, it was and it, it really wasn't a big affair.
Story_ID: 128645
Speaker 1: Okay, what were your expectations of going on to college or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, mama, mama [Mary Alice Buchanan] and them they wanted me to go to college they didn't care what I did, but you going to college boy, you going to college.  So when, when I, I didn't know, I didn't know where I was going to go.  I didn't have the guidance counselors to help guide me, but, but mama and them said you going to college.  So like I said I wrestled and so my cousin Kenny, you know, he wrestled.  He, he was good; he was really good.  And so he got a--I think he got a scholarship to Illinois State Normal University [Normal, Illinois, later Illinois State University].  So I said well shoot I'll go to Normal too so I went to Illinois State Normal University.
Speaker 1: But you did not get a scholarship, or you did?
Speaker 2: I ended up getting--well I didn't get it initially.  But after I was there for couple years I got it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: But see the significance is Illinois State Normal University that was a teachers college.  I didn't know it all I knew was that I was going to college.  And I wanted to major in Spanish because I wanted to be an interpreter but when I got there, I found that there was no curriculum for interpreter.  I said okay then I want to be a physical therapist so okay they didn't have a curriculum for physical therapy.  Then I said okay well I'll major in special education that a get me close to the physical therapy.  So I'll major in special education and minor in Spanish.  Well, the minor for physical--special ed was elementary so I couldn't take Spanish, so I lost the Spanish and ended up majoring in special education for the physically handicapped with a minor in elementary.
Speaker 1: Now do you--when you applied to Illinois State was there--was that like a land grant college in which you did not have to pay a lot of money or?
Speaker 2: No you're right we didn't have to pay too much money at all; It was a state university, big university, didn't have to pay much money at all.
Speaker 1: Okay and but you get there, and all of these doors are shutting at--in your face the way you want to go?
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Couldn't be an interpreter--
Speaker 2: So, so I just had to take advantage of majoring in special--see, see not knowing, not knowing what it was I didn't want to be a special ed teacher.  I wanted to be a physical therapist.  But not knowing ended up majoring in, in special ed.  So fine but, but when I got there see the special education major called for a lot of science.  And the first year that I got there now again having taken no science in high school, so the first courses I had were science courses in college.
Speaker 1: So you had some catching up to do.
Speaker 2: I sure did, but it worked out, and so I ended up, you know, again doing that, and it, it worked out.
Speaker 1: And how long did you spend at Illinois State?
Speaker 2: Four years.
Speaker 1: Four years.
Speaker 2: Four years yeah and just so happens that this past, this past well I was, I was inducted into the Education Hall of Fame [in 1997].  A number of years ago at Illinois State, now it's now Illinois State University and then last this past February [2007] they gave me a lifetime achievement award I think at the university so.
Speaker 1: You have been honored by your alma mater.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 128646
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little about what was that first year like at Illinois State Normal [University, Normal, Illinois, now Illinois State University]?
Speaker 2: It was it was all right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Now that was Normal (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Illinois (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: So how far were you from home?
Speaker 2: About, bout a 150 miles.
Speaker 1: Let's try to figure out how far you'd have to go to get back to that chicken?
Speaker 2: It's places there that had chicken.  I found some family there that had chicken all right (laughter), (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay, so you made friends fast (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah well, but you see that's, that's the one thing that I've done and regardless of where I was and regardless of my career.  I've always made contact and rebuilt relationships with folks.  And if they can cook, you know, I, I sure, I sure and even, even today, even today as I sit here as President of the National Education Association, I still have some of our board members bring me cakes, cookies, pies, fudge.  When I go out to some of the places, they know what I like, and so they usually try to find those places.  And so, it's, it's good but the first year it was, it was non-eventful, I think non-eventful getting, getting acclimated.  But there were, there were one thing though there was, there was we were in a conference called the Illinois Interscholastic Association conference [sic, Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic Conference] I think IIAC, IIAC.  And, and it was, it was Normal's time to have a conference track meet, and it was, it was good, you know.  And so we were, we were in the girls dorm, you know, you know, when you get down there everybody try to strut they stuff trying to show out for the girls.  So we were in the girls dorm Walker Hall, and, and the, the participants from other teams were coming in and so they came in they came into the girls dorm.  And I'll never forget it was, it was three, three black guys came in, and they were from Eastern Michigan [University, Ypsilanti, Michigan].  And, you know, kids where, where's your team and this cat turned around here we are.  His name was Hayes Jones, Hayes Jones was a world-class hurdler; he was in that conference.  And they would, and he show that the three of them was all they needed.  And then at Central Michigan [sic Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] you had Carver Shannon, Carver Shannon ended up playing in the in NFL.  And then you had Southern Illinois [University, Edwardsville, Illinois] you had John Flamer, who was a world-class miler.  And then you had Houston Antwine, ended up being in the, in the NFL.  And so you had all of these guys coming out of that IIAC conference and then later on you had Reg Weaver, you know, (laughter).  But also, but also coming out you had in basketball you had at the time was Fred Marberry, Fred Marberry he was, he was a bad brother.  And then you had [Pat Douglas] Doug Collins, Doug Collins graduated from Illinois State (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: And then and then a guy by the name of [Kenneth] Buzz Shaw.  Buzz Shaw ended up being the president of Southern Illinois [University] at Edwardsville [Illinois], and I think he's somewhere else now president of the university.
Speaker 1: Okay so you did have a few people in basketball but track, you're getting wiped out is that it?
Speaker 2: Yeah we, we didn't; track wasn't too good, track wasn't too good (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) But that's that first year now, and you're there you're trying to adjust to some new studies that you had not (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: New studies and new people (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: And new people (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Because many-there, there were a number of people from Chicago [Illinois].  And, and I was, I was fascinated with the folks from Chicago, you know, shoot.  From the city.  Oh yeah, so it, it worked out it worked out.  And we--it worked out they taught me how to dance, you know, it was good.
Speaker 1: Oh you didn't learn how to dance until you were in college?
Speaker 2: No I could, I could do a little bit but some of the kind of dances that they did I didn't.  We, we didn't--we back in the country we don't know that city stuff.  So they taught me how to do the cha-cha and all that's stuff man we showed out too.

Speaker 1: What was the student body [at Illinois State Normal University, Normal, Illinois, later Illinois State University] like I mean the--?
Speaker 2: The student body was mostly white.
Speaker 1: Mostly white but there were?
Speaker 2: Pockets, pockets of blacks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was percentage-wise a quarter?
Speaker 2: Percentage-wise it was very low.
Speaker 1: Very low.
Speaker 2: I don't know, but it was it was very low percentage-wise.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what were things like on campus between blacks and whites?
Speaker 2: They were okay, but I think for the most part blacks stayed in their spot and whites stayed in their spot.
Speaker 1: Okay did, did you have black fraternities and sororities on campus?
Speaker 2: Heck no, heck no oh no.  Only fraternity at the time was the Kappa Lambda--and it was a white fraternity it was a theatrical fraternity.  That's the only fraternity that was on a sorority-fraternity that was on campus.  And just so happen my junior year they asked me to be a member of the Blackfriars, asked me to be a member.  And the Blackfriars put on a theatrical production every year.  And the first year that, you know, I participated, and I won best actor.  Then the next year I participated I won best actor award.  So for two years I was a member of the Blackfriars, and I won the award, you know, that was all right.
Speaker 1: Let's, let's go to your second year.  Now you're becoming a little more acclimated by being away from home and being on campus and being in this new academic environment, relatively new (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: The sophomore year it--I can not--there, there was nothing that really stands out I think.  I think with the exception I think Eenie [Palestine Buchanan] got a car.  Eenie couldn't drive, but he got a car.  So, so he, he said he got a car.  So, I went home, and he gave me the car to take back to school, you know.  It was a, it was a Ford it was a blue Ford with, with a white top it was sharp, it was sharp (simultaneous) 19--.
Speaker 1: What it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: It was a (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Brand new?
Speaker 2: No, no it wasn't brand-new but it, it was nice it was nice.  So I took it to school.  And my, my first, my first year the--my roommate name was Lafayette Lockhart he was--stayed in the barracks, Cardinal Courts.  And so, you know, and, and I really think that it was the best thing for me because Lock was ex-marine and, you know, he had this regimen about him.  And so, you know, you get old jive cat, old jive time cat like me coming in, you know, he settle me down, you know.  And so, so I stayed in the courts for two years I believe it was.  And the living quarters for three years and then moved someplace else.  But again the relationship that was developed by the guys living in, in the barracks was a good one.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're, we're at a period now where things are changing civil life is changing.  People are being challenged; old ideas are being challenged between blacks and whites.  Country's moving toward war.  Did any of that impact you on campus at all (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: No it really didn't (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause you were mainly occupied with getting through school and that's a special education?
Speaker 2: Yeah and then not much of that impacted me nor the school.
Story_ID: 128648
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now when I was a senior, I do remember [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] came down to, to an adjoining university, Illinois Wesleyan [University, Bloomington, Illinois in 1961], and I just so happened to be the president of the student NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  And so Dr. King--they were gonna drive him back to Midway Airport in Chicago [Illinois].  And they asked me if I wanted to ride along, and I said yeah.  So I had a chance to, to spend at least three hours in the presence of Dr. King.
Speaker 1: And what impact did this have on you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Well it was interesting.
Speaker 1: Just listening to this--
Speaker 2: Well it was, it was I think subconsciously it had a great impact because not too many people can say that they spent three hours in conversation with Dr. King.  Now, now he was kinda tired, you know.  And he was sitting in front, and I think it must have been a couple of us sitting in the back.  You know, how people want to ask questions, you know even though you're tired.  People still want to ask you questions, you know, so you supposed to recognize that a person is tired and not constantly fire questions.  But that wasn't what the other person in the back seat was doing, you know, but, but again the experience was a was a well you (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Were you driving?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay someone else?
Speaker 2: (nodding his head yes).
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Then again, you know, a person that have not been to Chicago that must, you know, it was a big old experience for me going to Chicago.
Speaker 1: The, the--he came to campus it must have been a little awareness there on campus (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: You see I don't, I don't even know what the, what the issue was.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: That brought him to campus I really don't know.
Story_ID: 128649
Speaker 1: Let's talk more about what the students [at Illinois State Normal University, Normal, Illinois later Illinois State University] did, some of the activities for black students (simultaneous) on campus?
Speaker 2: Weren't that many. We'd go down to a place called The Track it was, it was a little kind of tavern-like place underneath, underneath the bridge.  We'd go down there or else we would try to have, you know, parties over a couple of people houses, but there really weren't that many activities for blacks.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So uneventful (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: It one that many there either.
Speaker 1: Okay, uneventful except for this new subject that you were delving into, special education.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it was kind of uneventful but it was, it was a good time.  But it was, it was not that much of an eventful time, but it was a good time.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And we, we--it were a couple, a couple of ladies that, you know, kind of hooked up with and they lived over in the, in the--what they call it Johnson House.  So we'd go see them.  Ms. now Ms. Johnson [ph.] could cooked that chicken.  Yeah, Mr. Johnson well he ate it too, you know, he's, he's big old cat he was, he was a roughie.  And then we'd go to the church Sunday morning go to the church.  And I never forget, you know, for offering Ms., Ms. Johnson was one of the trustees, deacons or whatever.  And then they come taken the offering and want everybody give $25 can't give $25 give $20.  You can't give $20 give $15 you can't give $15 give $10.  You can't give $10 give $5 you can't give $5 give what you can, you know, I'll never forget that (laughter).
Story_ID: 128650
Speaker 1: (Laughter) But you are there at school [Illinois State Normal University, Normal, Illinois, later Illinois State University] now you're in your third year, and you finally make the wrestling team.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did yeah, that's when I started to really blossom as a wrestler.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'll never forget it was, it was one of these, one of these ladies, you know, you know, I thought we were tight, you know.  She and, and found out she just broke my heart, broke my heart I said, oh Lord, what am I gone do.   And it just so happened that I had a wrestling match and the guy that I was wrestling he was from Eastern Illinois [University, Charleston, Illinois].  And he were supposed to be very good and, and I had asked the girl would you come and see me wrestle.  So I kept looking in the stands see if she had come, she didn't come so they called us out to the mat.  I beat that boy to death (laughter); I beat him to death (laughter).  And to show the psychological impact it has every time I--he never wrestled me again.  And the guy that I was supposed to wrestle was a guy who in high school was absolutely amazing as a wrestler.  And he was supposed to wrestle me but this other guy something happened to him.  And they put in this other guy named Novak and when this cat saw how I beat Novak all the other times he never wrestled me.  So I never wrestled neither one of them.  But again psychological and, and to show you the psychological impact the last two years of wrestling I was about forty-five and seven.  And six matches were lost to the same school: three the junior year to Southern Illinois [University, Carbondale, Illinois] and, and three the next year to Southern Illinois.  And I made, I made the tournament my junior year.  I wrestle this guy by the name of Grubbs he was good he was real he was real good, real good, and he beat me.  And then he told me he said next year my, my predecessor is coming his name is [Stan] Bergmeier.  And, you know, what Bergmeier beat me three times.  And in the conference finals I had him four to nothing, and he ended up beating me.  I had it psychologically that I could not beat anybody from Southern Illinois.
Speaker 1: Did you--would you mind telling us about your episode with that lady who broke your heart?
Speaker 2: Yes she--some cat--she was from Chicago [Illinois], and some cat came down.  And he had a he had one of those brand new Fords, you know.  I don't know man she, she went on back up to Chicago.  I guess they got hooked up again, you know, and came back.  And see I had just had my heart broken by a lady in Danville [Illinois], you know, childhood sweetheart, and then to come to find the chick from Chicago (simultaneous) I said shoot.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You're about to give up?
Speaker 2: Naw I said ain't gone put myself in this position no more (laughter).  So I went on out there and beat me--took out my frustration on a wrestling match. (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Took--he never knew what, what hit him.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 128651
Speaker 1: How were your studies going--doing at this time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: The studies were fine.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were really adjusting to the special education program and doing well (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, adjusting, adjusting to special ed program and adjusting to being away from home but it, it all worked out fine.
Speaker 1: Okay, and we come up to a--your fourth year.
Speaker 2: Fourth year: the wrestling and then the Blackfriars play then finally, you know, time to try to find a job.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so--
Speaker 1: Did--
Speaker 2: Oh wait the wrestling, the wrestling I made the, I made the--qualified for nationals took second in the tournament.  And, 'cause Bergemier [ph.] beat me and when you in the qualifiers tournament, nationals, NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] nationals.  I was first and second place in the conference.  And I did and getting second-place I did qualify to go to the nationals, but I didn't go, I didn't go; my weight shot up.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: So but and then time to find a job.
Speaker 1: Well before, before that you were doing pretty well as an actor (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah Blackfriars (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: And did you have any ambitions or never wanted to take that seriously?
Speaker 2: No I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay, even though you were doing well?
Speaker 2: It was just the play--yeah it was just the play that we had, but.
Story_ID: 128652
Speaker 1: Now, now you're about to graduate?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: And, you know, you spend all that time down there, and it's time to find a job.  So, special ed [special education] was my major (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: For the physically handicapped and so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: When you graduate (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: This was before I graduated.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: So I was putting out applications.  First application interview that I had was in Galesburg, Illinois.  And I didn't get the job if I had gotten that job in Galesburg my path career path would've been altogether different (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Why, why?
Speaker 2: I never would--I, I don't think that I would have become as involved in, in the union.  And I didn't get the job because of--I think because of discrimination, not discrimination because of the race.  But discrimination because of sex.  I don't believe they wanted males working with young physically handicapped kids.   So, I didn't get the job. So went on back and then I had applied I don't, I don't know how this happened but Superintendent Lee Morris from Harvey, Illinois came down.  And he wanted to interview me for elementary so he came down and, and he interviewed me.  See I wanted to be close to Chicago [Illinois] anyway, and Harvey was close to Chicago so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: And you had sort of fallen in love with that city is that right?
Speaker 2: Well, actually no because I hadn't I hadn't had a chance to be there that much.  My room--I had a roommate from Chicago and went to visit him, and his family--Donell Lambert [ph.] was his name.  And his father--they were his father and uncle were musicians they were good.  So we, we went, to--and they were from Louisiana.  So we had a I had a chance to go visit them.  And so, you know, it became, it became a place that was, was that I wanted to be in.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can I if I can just take you back for a brief moment there you did your practice teaching?
Speaker 2: Did my practice teaching at Metcalf School in, in Bloomington--Normal [Illinois] in physically handicapped.
Speaker 1: How did--how well did you do (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I did well (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: In that?
Speaker 2: I did well.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you impress any the authorities are there, there?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: No it was just a, a student-teaching experience but, you know, after, after four years of college you want to get out and make some money (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So that's the reason why I didn't go to grad school immediately I wanted to make some money.
Speaker 1: And by then though you had resigned yourself to being a teacher?
Speaker 2: (nodding his head yes).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See when I, when I had entered into Illinois State Normal [University, Normal, Illinois] that was the only choice that, that was there to be a teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah but I didn't know I was gone be a special ed teacher.  And as it ended up I wasn't I started out as a fifth-grade teacher because Lee Morris offered me a job making $5100 a year.  I said that, that's so much money let me give me that job $5100 man.  I jumped on that baby right away.
Speaker 1: You said yes?
Speaker 2: I sure did.
Speaker 1: Packed your bags (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I sure did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: To go to Harvey (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I sure did, I actually move to Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then that was that was the beginning.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was the beginning.
Speaker 1: Teaching there at Harvey what (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Riley, at Riley School.
Speaker 1: Riley?
Speaker 2: (nodding his head yes).
Speaker 1: All right, elementary.
Speaker 2: (nodding his head yes).
Speaker 1: And what was Harvey like at that time and what was Riley like (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: At the time Harvey was, was predominantly white and, and the school where I taught was an all-black school.  And the other seven schools in Harvey were overwhelming, overwhelmingly white but that changed as time passed on to, to the point where now it's almost completely black and Hispanic.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Some of the experiences that you had there at, at Harvey.  And did you find out why the superintendent wanted you there at Riley?
Speaker 2: I, I didn't I think he probably wanted me there because as a black teacher going into a black school (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, but those were some of those were some wonderful, wonderful experiences.  We had, we had a core staff that was just absolutely phenomenal.  And we had a principal we had several principles but the one that sticks out is a lady by the name of Ethel Gibbs, and she's retired now.  She used to I mean that it's all but she; she molded us as a staff and the parental environment, and the staff relationship was good.  And some of the teachers that I worked with there now, now retired.  But we still have a close relationship Ann Davis, Pearl Mack, JoAnn Kenner, you know, those were individuals that I mean it was, it was good.
Story_ID: 128653
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay, some of the experiences you had there at Riley [Elementary School, Harvey, Illinois]--I'm sure it must have been interesting.  You're coming in as a new teacher.  And so give us some of those experiences what was it like there?
Speaker 1: We had a, a wonderful staff, you know, and, and the staff consisted not only of teachers and principal.  But also a custodian and a secretary, they, they were very, very instrumental in terms of positive things that happened at that school.  And that was the first opportunity for me to see that a school community consists of more than just teachers.  It consists of everybody that works in the school and the better relationship that exists between the school and the home, the better off the kids will be because they will have a much better chance of being successful.  And I as a teacher would have a much better chance of being successful.
Speaker 2: Okay, some to the experiences are positive experiences that you?
Speaker 1: The parent, the parents, were very supportive for the most part.  They, they visited the school, they were available when you called, so it's, it's, it was just good.  That's; that's for the most of them.  Now there were some that were more of a challenge but, but it worked out.  And then during those times too, you know, I would go visit the community, go visit the homes.  And that was always a good thing for me.  Because, you know, it showed an interest on my part, and the parents liked it the kids liked it and the community liked it.  And it brought us much closer together.  You know, the relationship between me and many of the families and it, it still exists today, you know, because of those kinds of things.
Story_ID: 128654
Speaker 1: Some of the--those were some of the pleasant experiences you had, any unsettling experiences (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: There were, there were a couple, and one had to do with gangs.  When I first started, you know, no, no, no evidence of gangs.  But as time passed, you know, the gangs were just they, they started to become more prominent.  They started, while they may have started in Chicago [Illinois], they did spread to the suburban community.  And I'll never forget, you know, eighth-grade, seventh or eighth-grade class.  And, you know, I'd like to think that I was a friend to the kids and, and wanted them and they knew that I was their friend and their teacher.  And wanted the best for them and one, one morning I had, I had tried to talk these kids out of being members of the gang.  And one morning, you know, we had door duties.  So I went out for door duty to bring the kids in and written on the sidewalk in black spray paint was Mr. Weaver mind your own damn business.  Then you talk about a--you talking 'bout hurt.  But it taught me a lesson and so I, I had to change the approach.  In terms of how I, I worked with these guys.  And, and the one thing that I decided that I was going to do was to challenge the leaders.  And 'cause some of the leaders were former students.  I mean these guys, man they, they were rough.  They looked rough, were rough.  So I, I got a couple three of 'em one day and had 'em to come up to the school.  They were there, I say come on in here.  And took into a room and closed the door.  I said let me tell ya'll something.  I said I need ya'll's help.  I need you to make this school such that your brother, your niece, your nephew, your sister would wanna come to I said now if ya'll decide ya'll gone get me.  You better take me, you better take me out right now.  'Cause if you try to get me, and you don't then I'm coming after you all.  But I do need your help, that means no writing on the school.  That means no gang activity up in this school.  And, you know, what they--it worked, it worked.  So they, they helped me (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: How did they respond?  What did they say do (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: They didn't say too much, they didn't say nothing.  They didn't say nothing, but their actions proved that they had heard what I had said.  And just, it just so happened that, you know, a couple of them still in contact today.  And this one kid he got, he got sent to prison.  I think for murder.  When he got out guess where he called?
Speaker 1: Who?
Speaker 2: He called the teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and we, and, and me and the family still today have a relationship.  And his sister, who is one that I had as a student she now is a teacher.  And so it's, it's amazing.
Speaker 1: So that's a success really.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Any other successes?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You stayed at, at Riley [School, Harvey, Illinois] for how many--how long (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: I stayed there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: From nineteen--
Speaker 2: From 1961 until 1981, when I went to be President of IEA [Illinois Education Association].  And then in '87 [1987] when I worked for the State [of Illinois], and '89 [1989] went to Brooks Junior High [sic Brooks Middle School, Harvey, Illinois].  But, but Lolita Dozier, former student, ended up being a teacher partner working with me.  Ava, Ava Banks [ph.], the Banks family, you know, she ended up being a teacher and ended up being an NEA [National Education Association] Director and having meetings here.  Jimmy Norrell [ph.], Bullet Mosley [ph.], I mean it's, it's a, it's a whole host of them man.  And, and this past--it was in March, April what about five of them they had, they had a show here.  Art show and, and banquet or something they wanted me to come.  I was unable to make it, but you--and, and it's good, you know.  The Dawsons, Annie Dawson [ph.], and Leonard Dawson, who now are, are artists.  Earl Malone [ph.], it was just good stuff.
Story_ID: 128655
Speaker 1: The, the while at Riley [School, Harvey, Illinois] you started to take an interest you joined the Education Association [sic, Harvey Education Association].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did, I did.
Speaker 1: And you started to take an interest in that organization.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's, it's really amazing at that time the principals used to help membership.  First we use to tell you principals use to tell you--you had to join.   And so we did, and so, you know, we all joined.  And then I think it was 1967.  the--there were offices for President and Vice President were up.  And so they asked me if I wanted to run for Vice President, and I said yes.
Speaker 1: This would be the Vice President of the State?
Speaker 2: No, Vice President of the Harvey Education Association, they're local.  So I ran for the Vice President of the local.  And before I served one day as Vice President the President resigned.  So that automatically moved me up to President no experience, no nothing.  But I went in there and, and it, it worked out alright.  Superinten--we had, you know, a good superintendent to work with and it was then, his name was Lee Morris.  Not Lee Morris but, Wayne Peters.  He asked me he said, "Reg you wanna have a collective bargaining agreement?"  That's after I had been President for a year or two.  No, professional negotiation agreement, I said yeah.  Whatever that is, you know, I didn't know what it was.  So when I was President of, of the Harvey [Education] Association, we got our first collective bargaining agreement--professional negotiations agreement which was about in 1965 I think it is.  And then (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: So that was a feather in your cap?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely, you know, at the time when not many were not many collective bargaining agreements were in place.  And so we, we did well and then in 1970 I think it was suggested that I run for president of the Illinois Education Association.  And not knowing any better I said yeah.  Okay, I'll do it, and I ran now at the time there were not many blacks as delegates to the IEA [Illinois Education Association] convention.  And I, I'd say my first convention out of about 600 delegates I think maybe two or three were black.  And then in 1970 I ran, and I made the runoff by one vote.  And I lost the election to a guy from Danville [Illinois], Willie Hayes.  I mean Willie, Willie Lee [ph.] was his name.  And he beat me, he beat me in the main election but, you know.  I think that probably was the best defeat that I've ever had because I really wasn't ready to be president of the IEA, I really wasn't.  And I've never lost an election since never lost an election since.  And so when I lost that election, the executive directors said Reg you better organize a minority caucus because, you know, Blacks and, and Indians and, and the Hispanic, you know.  There was no order, so we help to organize them, and so we did pretty well.  And so in 1977 they asked me to run for vice president of the Illinois IEA Association, which I did, and I won.  And I had a successful two-year term and ran for reelection and won.  And so time came in 1981 are you gone run for president?  Well, naturally when you do well you run.  And so I ran for president in 1981 now it just so happen I had opposition.  When I ran for vice president, I had opposition the first time.  And when I ran for president the first time I had opposition and a lot of the opposition.  When I ran for president came from the person who was president when I was vice, president.  He was, he was not supportive, but that was okay so in 1981 I won the presidency of the Illinois Education Association.  It was a two-year term and was--and you stood to be reelected once, but my first year there they extended the term from four to six years.  So I was the president of the Illinois Education Association was for six years.  It was also during that time that Governor [James R.] Thompson signed the first comprehensive collecting bargaining bill for the State of Illinois during that time.  So here again I was president of the local when the collective bargaining bill was signed.  And president of the state when the comprehensive collective bargaining bill was signed.  Governor Thompson and the IEA, we had a really good relationship.  He was Republican but we had a really good relationship.  And we did a lot of things together to improve and enhance the ability for teachers and support staff to be successful and for kids to be successful.

Speaker 1: The--you, you took on these--the job first as Vice President and then President of the Harvey [Education] Association.  And then later as the Illinois State Association [sic, Illinois Education Association] but continued to teach there at Riley [Elementary School, Harvey, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well when I went, when I went to be the State President I had to take a leave of absence (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But when I was president of the local [Harvey Education Association] oh, yeah.  I taught every day; I taught every day (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: You didn't find this to be a burden?
Speaker 2: No, no, we became very active also in the political process helping to elect board members.  Because it's those board members that help to determine the conditions that you're gonna work under and, and we had a lot of success.  And I must say for the most part the relationship that, that association had with the board was pretty good, was pretty good.  It was some superintendents that, that could be challenging at times, but, but overall it was it was a good relationship.
Speaker 1: There was no resentment or anything the--as a--on the (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, what I, I would say for the most part no.  But, but when I was president all of the things that I had done as President.  And, and all of the committees that I had served on and helping to enhance and he and improve the education in Illinois as well as the national because I was on the, the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards and some other things.  When I went back to teaching, I do believe that there was a little hostility between the principal and myself.  And it was at that time when it, it became a real challenge a real challenge.  It, it and I said it, you know, I said if it happens to me, and I'm, you know, have done all this then it can happen to anybody.  And if in fact others see it happening to me then they would no longer stand up and speak out.  So it was, it was, it was, bad.  And, and I talk about it today, you know, and, and I tell folks, you know.  You can not have a system that functions well if in fact you want to do it from top down.  You can't do it--you cannot have a system if in fact if the principal is gonna tell you everything that you have to do or you can't do.  It, it's not gonna work like that and, and also during that, during that experience I was endued with another, another principal, I mean it was, it was.  At evaluation and I said I know I'm a good teacher I know it but, you know, what it doesn't matter where the principal knows it the kids will tell you.  The kids will let you know whether not you're good.  The kids, parent, they let me know that I was good.  So whatever evaluation there was it, it was just a performer thing.  So we went through the evaluation process this one year.  And the assistant principal she evaluated me.  And so she had come in to observe, and I mean we had man see, see I figured that if in fact that you cannot perform one time of the year.  When they come in to evaluate you, you need not be in the profession.  Now I performed this one day but I performed every day.  And I mean we've had I gave a lesson man that you would not believe, and it was good and it was good I mean the kids were excited.  I was excited and when she left out of the room she said she was excited.  I went back for my post, my post-observation conference.  Man, you should of--the evaluation that she gave me.  I mean it was not reflective of what I did to what she saw.  And so I said no you can't do this, you know, so, you know, we had to negotiate out what I would and would not accept.  But, you know, what just so happen that President [Bill] Clinton had just sent word to me that I was an excellent teacher.  Had just sent it, so I told her I said look here the president of the United States thinks I'm excellent.  But I can't get a excellent here, and, you know, what I did see I was one of--the only one of the very few that could have a positive impact on these kids.  And the kids would listen to me I said okay, I'm going to let 'em run free now.  They can do whatever they want to do.  No, Mr. Weaver, you can't--I said oh yes I can.  So I see a kid in the hallway I used to stop, uh-uh.  And then she saw me one she said, Mr. Weaver, you gotta do I said, no, no, no that's what excellent teachers do.  I said you cannot have it both ways, you know.  So I mean those are some of the fights that you have to have that you need not have to have.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 128657
Speaker 1: Let me take you back a little ways only because of what you just said.  At what point during those days at Illinois State [Normal University, Normal, Illinois, now Illinois State University] did you become comfortable that you could be a very good teacher?
Speaker 2: I didn't, I didn't know then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had no idea then.
Speaker 1: Okay, at what period then did you become to suspect that you could be?
Speaker 2: Probably after being in two or three years.
Speaker 1: At Riley?
Speaker 2: (nodding his head yes).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And seeing the impact seen the impact that I had and the impact that I could have.  And see and how the students would responding and relate.
Speaker 1: And then having some successes--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --at the local level there in Harvey.
Speaker 2: Well success always help now (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Then having greater success at the state level?
Speaker 2: As, as an association.
Speaker 1: And as an association person.  And but yet you remained there teaching?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: As a first love?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And did you--what made you think that you could give up the teaching and go to the national level in this very important national education unit?
Speaker 2: In, in this business, you know, you do your job and if you do it well people recognize you.  And there's one thing that I think is, is extremely important and critical, and that is that people trust you.  And they see you of having high integrity.  And that's what I tried to demonstrate I, I didn't, I didn't disrespect anybody (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Uh-hum.
Speaker 2: But was always an advocate and people could see that.  And, you know, when you we treat people right people will, people will, will respond in kind and that's what has happened here.
Story_ID: 128658
Speaker 1: Okay, the, the now you went through this period of the '70s [1970s] assassinations of [Reverend Dr.] Martin [Luther King, Jr., 1968]--J (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I re--see I remember, I remember when, when [President] John F. Kennedy was assassinated [1963] that was, that was--teaching I had a fifth-grade class.  And I can remember just like it was yesterday where I was standing.  My desk was my desk was on the corner of the wall, and I'm standing behind it and I got word that the president had been shot, and I said God doggit.  And I also remember when Malcolm X was killed [1965].  I was headed down to Danville driving down the highway.  And heard on the radio that Malcolm X. had, had been shot, you know.  And so with the kids it was, with, with President Kennedy it was more of a shocker, you know.  So but, but those are events that I certainly remember.
Speaker 1: How about Martin Luther King?
Speaker 2: Martin Luther King I remember--I cannot remember where I was when Dr. King was shot, but I do remember all of the all of the, the impact of him being shot.   And what that was and what that had in many parts of the country.
Speaker 1: And did these events change your outlook or change the kids that you were trying to teach, changed their outlook (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I don't know if it's change, but it did help us.  It helped us become more cognizant at what's going on in the world.  And yeah, yeah it, it definitely had some kind of impact yeah how could people do this to somebody.
Story_ID: 128659
Speaker 1: And the--being in Harvey, in Harvey, Illinois and of course you were living in, in Chicago [Illinois].  With some of the fast changes that were going on in, in the world did you adapt a political outlook on any of the issues, especially education issues?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I don't know if it was a political outlook.  But it seems as though it gravitated towards, towards those people who may have been Democrats. Even though back home, you know, our families I think were Republicans, you know.  But I think the, the ideologies and philosophies that the Democratic Party were, were probably more in line and in keeping with what I was looking for.
Speaker 1: The--so the National Education Association [NEA], of course, is a nonpolitical organization but is still a union and (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: No we're very political.
Speaker 1: Very political(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Oh we are.
Speaker 1: And where, where--I'm going with this--well let's, let's--go here.  First you, you are now the president of the Illinois State Education Association.  And some of the activities now that you were getting involved in, in that position statewide, state position (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: We became very involved in the political process because we knew that those individuals that impacted those decisions.  That impacted that we had to make sure that they were we had a voice in the saying who they were going to be.  So we became very involved and (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: From the election all the way from the Governor to the house and senate.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay you're talking about Governor Thompson there at that time, okay.  Okay, you're thirty-two years old and you were the president of the state [Illinois] Education Association we'll talking about 19--the 1980s (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Eighty-one to '87 [1987] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Eighty-one to '87 [1987].  A gentleman out of Chicago says he's going to run for president.  Several other people are running at that time what are some of the activities of the National Education the State National Education (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: State Association?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Well the State Association is a, is a microcosm of the national because we do basically the same thing.  But it's only done at different levels, you know, training, servicing to members advocating for students.  Advocating for public education for political process anything that we can do to advocate to make sure that every town has assets to a great public school.  And we did it at the state level, and that's what we do at the national.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: There, there's one thing that I wanted I want to go back on.  When I was talking about back when I was a kid during the summer, we could never get jobs.  And then some, some of the kids got jobs working in the cornfield detasseling corn.  But I was so small that I could not get up to detassel the corn.  So I went, I went to this agency called the Department of Employment Security and took a series of tests called the Gassman [ph.] tests.  And it was, you know, manipulative and so forth and, and other test aspects.  And so when I went back for the post test results the lady told me that the only thing based on these results.  That the only you will be able to do in life is work with your hands that's what she told me.  And I said, and I didn't realize the significance of that then, but I think I've spent my life trying to prove that woman wrong.  And I think that I've done pretty well and so when I left the presidency of IEA [Illinois Education Association] wanting to get a job making some money somewhere.  You will never ever guess where the governor got me a job.  And that was the Illinois Department of Employment Security that when I was this high the lady told me that the only thing you'll be able to do is work with your hands.  When I worked with the department one of the areas that I had responsibility for was the area that gave me that test when I was this high.
Story_ID: 128660
Speaker 1: The--because you were, you were the president of the Illinois Educational Association that sort of helped you get this position?
Speaker 2: Yeah, man (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Participating in the political process (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Helps you have--participating in the political process and, and helping out folks they can certainly make it possible to offer assistance to you in some form or fashion.
Speaker 1: Tell us because that pulled you out of the teaching (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: It did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Realm and why you accept it(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I wanted, I wanted to make some money.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I couldn't make money teaching and so (laughter) when I went to work for the government that gave me more money.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: But what I found out was there just there's more bureaucracy in state government than in education.  And so after two years I said well I don't think this is what I want to do.  And then I came back to teaching in 1989.  Now just so happen that there was a position on the NEA executive committee that was open.  And they asked me to run for that and I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I ran.  Went back to teaching and '89 [1989] ran for executive committee and won.  And then ran for reelection and won and so and that took us, took us up to 1996 and that's when I ran for NEA [National Education Association] Vice President.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that's the--I was trying to find out how to get through that, and you help me there.  You after two years there out of teaching you missed it and you, you even though you were making more money then you could at teaching (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah I didn't that government work wasn't for me.  And so I decided well, you know, I'd go back to teaching (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: And when this position came open I ran for executive committee and then after three years a re-election and in '96 [1996] ran for vice president and won.  Re-elected and then in 2002 ran for president.
Story_ID: 128661
Speaker 1: You're in your thirties now, and we don't want to skip over that very important matter.  You're meeting someone who did not break your heart who made your heart jump and you met a young lady Betty Jo Moppin.
Speaker 2: Moppin.
Speaker 1: Moppin, and tell us about how you met.
Speaker 2: Well actually I had known her for quite some time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And in fact, her family moved up on the--we call Johnson Street the hill.  So they moved (simultaneous--
Speaker 1: Oh, back, back in Danville [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Danville, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were shooting Danville.  So I went to Jackson School [Danville, Illinois], she went to Washington [Elementary] School [Danville, Illinois].  So, but we, we hadn't known each other.  And so when they moved up on the hill, you know, we got to know each other a little bit better.  Walked to school together and so forth and so on.  And then, you know, one thing led to another.
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: We ended up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: But it took you until nine, nineteen (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Sixty-three.  No, yeah '63 [1963] to marry.
Speaker 1: Oh, so '63 [1963].  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And I think we had the first kid Von, Reggie Von [Reginald Von Weaver], and I think it was '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Okay, and give us Reggie Von.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And then Rowan [Weaver] I think he was in '73 [1973], I think.
Speaker 1: Rowan Anton.
Speaker 2: Rowan Anton, yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's, that's the immediate family right now.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so they were with you as you were going through the years at Riley [School, Harvey, Illinois] and when you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah Betty was but the kids, the kids, kids came later on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But yeah.
Story_ID: 128662
Speaker 1: And so--see a lot of times I would bring kids home.  And then bring them home to eat and just be, be a part to show 'em, you know, just to--a relations and man that was, that was, that was powerful.  That was powerful. They'd stay all night.  And I'd cook 'em dinner, cook 'em breakfast, you know.  They would go back and get up and go to school (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I think, and I think it, it had an impact on them as well as their families.
Speaker 2: The--during the early '70s [1970s] the--there was an issue of teaching math and science.  How did that impact what you were doing both as an official of the Educational Association [sic Harvey Education Association] and as a teacher?
Speaker 1: I don't think it had any, any impact.  You know, we had a curriculum, and that's what we were teaching.  You know in terms of science.
Speaker 2: Were there any, was there any special emphasis on any subjects during that period?
Speaker 1: Nope, nope it was a well-rounded curriculum, and the expectation was that everybody taught that well-rounded curriculum.  As opposed to now when all the focus is because of No Child Left Behind [Act] right now on, on math, math and reading.
Story_ID: 128663
Speaker 1: All right, let's, let's talk about the No Child Left Behind [Act] and that, that program.
Speaker 2: Well, when, when the law was first passed, the goals and the objectives were good.  And, and they were good because they're ours, you know.  We, we strived to have accountability closing the achievement gap, qualified and certified to teach those are the things that we would want.  And so when they took those goals and said that this is what we want, and No Child Left behind, we said fine because, you know, we understand.  But, but once they passed this law then it was--they found that it was very difficult to implement.  And so there were a number of unintended consequences that occurred when they started to implement this law.  So we started, we started to, to talk about it from the national perspective, in terms of some things that needed to be done to modify it.
Speaker 1: We being the National Education Association.
Speaker 2: (Nodding head yes) We talked to our members and, and they said look, the way this law currently is crafted it's practically impossible for us to be successful. And so we said okay I was just coming in into office as president and the members were talking about this, and I said okay well give, give it a chance to work all right. Just, just be cool give it a chance to work then I'd go out again they said Reg this thing is not working.  I said okay give it a chance to work, you know.  Congress wouldn't pass a law that's not gonna work for the education of kids of America, they wouldn't do that.  Third time I've gone they said Reg.  I said my mama didn't raise no fool so that third time I say we gotta do something.  And so what we did, we called a group of selected folk in--presidents, executive directors--and we said we got to do something.  And so we, we spent some money and we hired a, a consulting firm did some, some focus groups, and we came up with the message.  The message was one size, one size does not fit all.  We said that a test should not be used to determine the future of a kid.  We said that No Child Left Behind focuses on paperwork, testing and bureaucracy.  That's not what the folks want.  Now when you do that, you know, you're going up against the Bush Administration, because it was the Bush Administration that was touting this as the greatest thing since sliced bread.  But you had 87 percent of the Democrats that, that supported it in Congress and 85 percent of the Republicans.  So it was a bipartisan effort, which was fine.  So anytime you talk about things that should be changed you're going up against the people that passed it.  But, you know, what as educators we knew that it was not right and as a result something needed to change.  And they castigated us, they called us names, nobody would join with us with one exception.  And that one option is the American Association of School Administrators, the superintendents.  They joined with us and said that something is wrong.  Now, again we kept going down the road with our message, you know, it's a great public schools for every child.  And every kid deserves access to that, and this is not allowing that to occur.  And then they still called us names, and then on February 24, 19--2004.  I was sitting right over there at my desk minding my own business.  I got a call from the press saying that Secretary [of Education Rod] Paige had called the National Education Association a terrorist organization.  Now, I said now you know, now under my breath now, you know.  I said you--but I didn't say it to the press because one thing that I wanted to do was be cool all right.  And I wanted to stay on message, so I tried to, you know, play it off.  And the next day though the members were just going off on them they were just--how dare you say that.  And, you know, that was, that was really a nasty thing to say at that time.  You know, you know you, you're about three years off from the terrorist bombing in New York.  And people saying that the soldiers are gonna go to Iraq or supposed to go to Iraq to kill terrorists.  And then you call the educators in this country a terrorist organization.  That, that is, you know, that is so not nice.
Story_ID: 128664
Speaker 1: But, you know, I--you know, in the press I may, I may have hit him [Secretary of Education Rod Paige] a couple times but I didn't hit him hard.  Because I didn't want to get off-message because I told our folk that we are going to stay on message.  And the message is great public schools for every child.  You see, you know, to get mired in that other stuff that becomes the issue.  I wanted to keep the focus on the kids.  And the kids deserve to have a great public school.  Now, you fast-forward to today when re-authorization is being talked about.  Man.  Many of our most every--I cannot tell you the support that is out there to change this.  We have right now about 140 Congress people that say that something needs to be done.  Every state in every state in the in this country their legislature in some form or fashion has taken a position that said that something needs to happen with No Child Left Behind, every state.  Now if in fact the law was doing such a great job, and it was working then you wouldn't have all of this dissension about something needed to be done.  You have in the house about 140 Congress people in the Senate you got about fifty.  You know, that's saying that something that needs to be done, and many are Republicans all right.  So, so, you know, we're, we're asking for, for some things that we think are very, very important for kids.  One growth models, right now the law says that a kid in third grade as an example will be tested and measured.  Their measures their growth measures their growth will be measured with kids next year in third grade.  No, you don't do that, so we're calling for growth model measure a kid from here to here to determine, you know, their real growth.  Right now, you know, and, and there ought to be some other things used in addition to a test.  A test should not be the sole criteria to determine whether or not a kid learns.  And whether or not a kid is successful, and experience teaches me that.  And I told you about this one test in the Department of Employment Security where that woman told me that the only thing that you will be able to do is work with your hand because of that test.  You see as a teacher that let me see that a test--you cannot determine whether or not a kid is going to be successful using only a test.  There are other things that you have to use, and we say the same thing for No Child Left Behind.  Look at growth models look at--we think that also there needs to be something in the law that constantly rewards and show success that happens in schools.  Not just punishing and label, when you punish and label I mean that sends a negative impact a negative impression to the community.  And then we say that those kids that are English language learners and in special needs classes, there ought to be some kind of, of appropriate assessment used to determine their knowing.  And, and, you know, and I tell folks if a kid in special ed could learn the same way as a kid in regular ed, then why are they in special ed?  And two we said there needs to be smaller class sizes.  Three we need--we say that there need to be highly qualified teachers in the classroom.  You know, in so many instances many of the kids that we are talking about do not have highly qualified teachers.  And then the expectation is that they perform the same way as the kids that do have.  And that do have adequate and equitable funding and do have smaller class sizes and do have safe and orderly schools.  So we say there needs to be qualified and certified teachers in every classroom.  And then board-certified national board certified teachers should be determined to be highly qualified.  We also say that teachers who work in hard-to-staff schools ought to be given some kind of incentive.  Because it, it's really interesting and difficult for many people to go into schools that are that are underperforming.  And so, and so in many instances people think that is okay just to send anybody in these--it's not, you know.  I mean you got people that want to have people that are not qualified and certified go into to teach Ray Ray, Junebug, Little Willie and Too Sweet and Little Man.  And Little Willie, Too Sweet, Junebug, and Little Man they run they butts right on out there.  And it's not because Little Willie, Junebug, Too Sweet, Little Man can't learn, but they deserved to have the same highly qualified teachers as everybody else.  And so I reject the notion that sending anybody in a body in the classroom go heck no it ain't gone work.  And don't do it with kids that look like me primarily 'cause it anit right and I ain't having it.  So I'm fussing and fighting (laughter), and I'm doing what I can.  And the last thing is teachers that teachers that are--teach multiple subjects and in rural areas there needs to be flexibility there.  So No Child Left Behind is coming up for re-authorization, I don't know what's gonna happen don't know when it's gonna happen.  But what I am saying a number of people now are so disenchanted that they say scrap it all together.  That's not what we're saying we're saying fix it so that it works for kids.
Story_ID: 128665
Speaker 1: You had the number of the--all of them in fact I think the, the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates at your recent--
Speaker 2: Actually we had--
Speaker 1: --Convention. And--
Speaker 2: Actually at our convention we had, we had seven Democratic candidates and one Republican.  We sent invites to all of the candidates who had indicated that they were running for president.  They had to fill out a questionnaire.  It just so happened that all of the Republicans that were asked only one that was [Mike] Huckabee he sent in his questionnaire and he was invited.  And, and, and seven Democratic candidates they did appear.  The purpose of asking them to come see when you think about it all of the debates that had occurred prior to that prior [HM] Tavis Smiley. Tavis Smiley over here at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], Tavis Smiley he had the foresight to make sure that something on education was asked on, on his debate.  And before Tavis nobody talked about education nobody all right.  And so outside of Tavis then they comes to the NEA [National Education Association], and they had a chance to talk about it--what their education platform would be and it was good.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  The--so you, you had a chance to make sure that they understood at least the ones who came to the conference what the NEA position was?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, well we, we'd have to yeah.  You know, in all 9,000 folks, but, but, it was, it was a wonderful experience I think for the candidates as well as for the, for the audience.  You should've seen our folk man I mean, I mean they were so disciplined man, it was, it was absolutely wonderful, and I would say the candidates, the candidates did a pretty good job.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 128666
Speaker 1: The, the--there's another issue that you have been on even before you came to the national office [National Education Association] here in Washington, D.C., and that is the unusually high dropout rate.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean see, you know, we came out with the dropout plan last, last October [2006].  And, you know, what people talked about it but I didn't see anybody doing anything.  I get so, so sick and tired of people just talk, talk, talk.  What are you doing?  Just like in this no child left behind they talk about the disaggregation of data. Which simply says that you set a, you know, you, you take apart the data that shows how kids learn including minority kids. I didn't need no; no child left behind to tell me that some kids were not learning in this area.  But the question is once you disaggregate the data then what?  You see and, and people, to act--they don't want to deal with that and so when it come when it comes to the dropout rate.  Everybody saying oh how bad it is, oh this, oh that.  But what are you doing?  And so we didn't see anything, so we came up with our own twelve point dropout plan.  And the first part of the plan was to say that every kid up to age twenty-one needs to graduate from high school.  Or have a graduate or have a, a an equivalent diploma or a diploma or its equivalent.  And the second part was that some of these kids drop out of school but wanna to come back, but they don't wanna come back to a place where they say the little kids are.  So there needs to be an alternative site, and that was the second point.  We also talked about in the plan having parental involvement target by making classes interesting for kids targeted by making classes relevant for kids.  And so those are the kinds of things that we, we recognize needs to be a part of making it possible for kids to stay in school.  Great public schools for every child 30 percent of those kids were not getting that because they were dropping out of school.  For minorities, 50 percent were dropping out Hispanics 50 percent and, and Native Americans 50 percent.  So the people that we need to have to be a part of this economy to be able to compete in the economy were dropping out of school.  And nobody was saying, nobody were doing anything but saying oh how bad it is, naw.  Now I got to tell you this since we came out with that plan I have seen more action on the part of more people talking about what we can do to help the dropouts.

Speaker 1: The--because of your strong philosophies and your coming back in to teach and then to work with the National Education Association [NEA], things have changed quite a bit.  Back in 2002 I believe?
Speaker 2: I think I think we're a different organization now (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think, I think that we are an organization now that has reached out to, to many people and many people have reached out to us.  That typically had not occurred.  We are, we are we, we have a minority community and outreach program that is second to none headed up by Cynthia Swann, and she has a team that I mean and, and the object (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: You want to tell us a little about the minority outreach (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: And the object, yeah.  And the object the object, see many people that have issues in education are people that look like me.  And people that might be Hispanic and so knowing that there is no need in not being able to communicate with that community to let them know that we are with you.  And these are some of the kinds of things that we want to work with you on to make sure that your kid has the best chance to be successful.  And so we're going out to the communities we're reaching out to the various organizations.  And I have to tell you it's been, it's been very very successful in terms of our outreach.  We're also talking about how we can impact how we can raise salaries.  You know, people don't come into the profession because number one lack of support.  Lack of respect, lack of being involved in the decision-making process.  Lack of money and lack of having to work in a school that's not safe and orderly.  So to have those kind of conditions exist and not try to it address them you're not gonna get people coming in.  You hear people say well we want people to come into the teaching profession why can't we get 'em in.  Well nobody gone come in when you paying them $20,000 when they can go somewhere else and make $45,000 initially.  So that's one of the reasons why we call for a $40,000 beginning salary for teachers.  And a living wage for our support professionals and so, you know, those are some of the kinds of things that we're working on too.
Story_ID: 128668
Speaker 1: Just make sure that we have everything in detail let me take you back to 1989 and when you ran for, for office (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: When I went back to teaching.
Speaker 1: And you went back to teaching okay.  Let's--what you, you accepted a job on the council there am I correct?  Or you were elected to the national (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I was elected at the, on the executive committee (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Right, let's let's go back to what you felt you could contribute to the National Education [Association](simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: I didn't know anything man, I didn't know.  All I knew was that all I knew was that this was a position on the executive committee.  And I had no idea.  I didn't. I really didn't.  It was just one of these things where you happen to be in the right place at the right time.  And, and but see it was after that, that I was able to see an impact that one could have in these particular positions.  And so I watched, and I learned and I listen and I visited various groups so that, so that at each step of progression I was able to do more.  And so when I finally got to sit in the president's seat I was able to do much more than when I was vice president.  And I was able to do a little more as vice president then as an executive committee member.  And but the rules and responsibilities are different but it gave but see if I had not made that step to the executive committee I would not have been able to sit in the president's chair.
Speaker 1: Then when you say you visited each group you mean the various state educational associations?
Speaker 2: States--yeah, various states and communities.  Man, I have, have been all over and, and see in, in this business you can only go when you're invited.  And so my calendar it gets full very fast working in schools talking with kids.  And when--and let me just give you one--it's it's, and I tell this story everywhere and, and it goes to show you what happens.  I was invited to the State of Missouri last year, and they wanted me to come down and talk to the state for the Democratic state legislature.  Because it was some issues 65 percent solution vouchers all of those kinds of nasty, nasty things would have a nasty impact.  So they wanted me to come down and talk to the Democratic Caucus, so I did.  I went down there, and I talked to them and I found out that they put their they put their legs in their pants one leg at a time just like I do.  And I talked to them man and, and we had a real good time.  I jacked them up real good, and they came out hollering and screaming and then they want to invite me to this one school district in the State of Missouri.  One state--it was, it was the Wellston school district [Wellston, Missouri].  The only state [sic school district] in Missouri that had been taken over by the state because of poor performance.  So they wanted me to visit that school I said fine.  So after I left the state legislature drove on down here to St. Louis.  I went to the school oh man they had the cameras out, TV was out.  Oh the NEA [National Education Association] president was coming oh shoot I did a interview.  The principal was so happy; superintendent was so happy, you know, that the NEA president was there.  So after all that now we gone take you into a eight-grade class, I said fine.  So they took me into this class introduce all the kids to the NEA president.  Now these kids they looked.  He didn't know who the NEA President was they could care less.  When I saw that, that's when the teacher came out.  The teacher came out, and I started to teach these kids.  Now, you know, some kids they just some kids just don't do right, you know.  As good as it is so I'm steady talking thinking I'm doing a good job, and mostly all the class was listening.  And this one little boy he just ain't doing right for nothing.  So he, he just so now, you know, you gotta have a different strategy it used to be a time when you go holler and scream that don't work no more.  So I went over I was, I was steady talking steady talking.  And, and then can I, can you follow me if I get up on that camera? (off-camera discussion) So we talked, we talked, and so I didn't say nothing to him.  So he, he messing up, so I'm talking with the class.  And so what I did, I went right on by and got behind him and put my hand on his shoulder right here.  And, and you would think that the little fool would, would stop, but he didn't.  I put a little pressure right there I put that pressure right there man.  And, you know, that little boy he ain't say, he ain't say another word, you know.
Story_ID: 128669
Speaker 1: And so after it after it was over I started to ask questions, for questions.  You know what he did?  He raised his hand he said, "Sir can you come back and be our graduation speaker?," you know.  See kids, kids don't care how much, you know, until they know how much you care.  And these kids knew that I cared all right.  And, and then and then see if, if in fact, if in fact you don't wanna, if in fact you don't wanna hear what these kids got to say, then don't ask them don't ask em.  So after I done talked to them, I said okay, y'all wanna talk to me.  So they said yeah.  Little girl raised her hand, so she got up to talk and see we couldn't understand her because of her, her she could not enunciate.  Pronounce--I said baby now come on now I said no take your time.  Take your time so that we can hear you and understand because we really do want to hear what you have to say.  And so she did, and I told her to thank and I told the class give her a big round of applause.  Man, these kids clapped oh shoot you should've seen the expression on her face.  And there's a one little kid raised his hand.  And so he asked the question that the principal and the superintendent could answer oh they felt so good.  That they could answer this kid question oh shoot they felt so good.  Then he raised his hand again, and he asked a question that I'll never forget I'll take, I'll take it--I'll take this question all over the country and indeed all over the world.  And his question was, why is it that in this school we cannot have technology taught to us?   Why is it in this school that we cannot have home economics taught to us?  Why is it in this school that we cannot have French taught to us when right down to the road where the white kids go they got that and more?  And, you know what, I said no more, I said no kid in America no kid in America should have to ask that question as to why we cannot have that.  And I gotta tell you man that, that just that just charged me up again.  And so that's why I said I'm taking it to, I say I don't care I'm taking it to 'em man.  I'm taking it to 'em and the issue that I'm taking to 'em is a issue they don't want to talk about and that is funding for these schools.  Because if in fact these kids do not have the funding they will never make it.  If you are familiar with the school in, in Chicago [Illinois] [HM Reverend] Jesse Jackson a year ago, two years ago he took some kids from Harper High School [Chicago, Illinois] out to Naperville [Illinois] to Neuqua [Valley High School].  If you've never seen Neuqua you ought to see Neuqua.  If you have never seen Neugua man it is something that is out of this world.  And one little girl they took out there she said they really don't care about us do they?  Oh no honey we do.  Why do you say that?  Because if y'll did why is it that we gotta go to the school where we go.  And these kids go to this school, and these kids, are compared in terms of that test.  So that's why I say funding is the issue people say that money is the root of all evil that's a lie.  It's the lack of money that's the root of all evil because it is the lack of money that prevents many of our kids from having what they need.  In terms of qualify certified teachers, smaller class sizes, safe and orderly school state of the art technology.  It's crap.  So I'm taking it to 'em man, I'm taking it to 'em.
Speaker 2: When you say you're taking it to them you mean (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: I'm taking it to anybody that'll listen (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: More Wellston--St. Louis [Missouri] schools, elementary (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: Policy makers, I'm taking to the policy makers now (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The policy makers and I'm trying to and I'm talking about with our state affiliates because I say I want to talk about it at the national level.  Make 'em talk they don't want to talk about it but I'm gone put it on tape.  And, and the people who work in our states I'm asking them to put it on their table as well.  Make 'em talk about it when you think about it see in, in this business we have all kinds of committees its committees and commissions.  Oh man all you gotta do you want to change oh appoint a committee.  If you want to do this and that oh appoint  a committee, Oh crap.  For twenty-five years that's been going on and for twenty-five years the recommendations that have been coming out of all of this are only three of a puzzle. The three things that they come out with recommendations on are standers, assessment, and accountability.  And when you look at all of the stuff that being talked about now is from focusing on those three things standards, assessment, and accountability.  But they don't want to talk about adequate and equitable funding and economic structure and tax base.  You can not have all of this if in fact you do not have this.
Story_ID: 128670
Speaker 1: I want to address the makeup or the, the way the NEA [National Education Association] is, is laid out.  Because you are projecting that you're going to be dealing with a number of issues, but you're going to have to start there at the grassroots level (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: State and so forth local (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: The NEA is a parent organization, and it is made up of affiliates.  We have an affiliate in every state and every state has local affiliates, so we have 3.2 million members.  And we have fifty-one affiliates and each, and again each one of those affiliates has locals.  And so those issues that are tremain to the local level.  You know, they, they seek our assistance, and we seek theirs.  And so as an, as an example, when it comes to funding a lot of the---most of the funding comes from the state and local level.  So that's where the emphasis is going to have to be placed on, on the legislators and, and community back, back in the states.   Now when it comes to no child--as an example No Child Left Behind, that is federal legislation that had been passed.  And so a, a lot of the activity in terms of change and, and the people that you talk to would be the Congress people.  However, it is very helpful to have the people at the state level and people at the local level weighing in as well with their views and their opinions.  And I think that they have done to Congress as it relates to No Child Left Behind.  So there're federal issues that are handled by Congress and there are state and local issues that are handled by their respected political body.
Speaker 1: Okay, The, the--one of the questions.  I wanted to ask before was that not only were you personally and the NEA having to deal with an administration but also the head of the Department of Education?
Speaker 2: I have to tell you since I've been president.  I had been president during a time when we had had, for the most part, a Congress and an administration that has not been as supportive of education as I would like to see.  But despite that, I think that the NEA and, and local affiliates I think we've done an outstanding job.  We've done an outstanding job advocating for kids.  And a lot of times that advocacy deals with making sure that bad things are not put in place.  Because we recognize that these bad things can have a negative impact on kids.  Now a lot of times the things that we think are bad, some people that don't like us don't think they're bad.  But let me give you another example of something that I think is bad that some others may not, and it speaks to what needs to happen in the future.   During the last presidential election, there were all kinds of people talking about what needs to happen for the next president to be elected.  One of the issues that was raised is that the next president will appoint members of the Supreme Court.  But, you know, what didn't nobody hardly listen to that they elect they elected that boy anyhow.  And he put in Alito, and he put in Roberts and look what is happened now.  The latest decision in Seattle [Washington] and in, in Kentucky, which takes back many things that Brown [v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954)] put in place.  Don't think that's bad, just wait.  The next president, the next president that's elected will have an opportunity to appoint anywhere from one to three Supreme Court justices because of the age and health of some current Supreme Court Justices.  The wrong justices in place will take this country back.  I--people need to think about that, and so that's the reason why I believe, and it's so important to advocate for those things that are important.  And that's what we were doing as it relates to kids and, and public education.  Advocating for every child to have a great public school.
Story_ID: 128671
Speaker 1: You know, you gotta have the tools and resources in order to make that happen and recognizing that times change.  And you can--and one thing that I tell folks, and our teachers and support staff and principals.  You cannot do in 2007 what you did in 1967 'cause it don't work.  These kids will run you out of there.  How do I know?  'Cause I tried it.  I use to--when I left out of the classroom before I left I used to be able to say do your homework boy; they say okay Mr. Weaver.  Stop that fight boy, okay Mr. Weaver.  Bring your mother up here, okay Mr. Weaver.  I come back to teaching in 1989 I say bring your mother up here, for what.  Stopped that fightin' boy, you can't-- you can't make me.  Do your homework boy it ain't gone do no good.  So see times change and as a result you have to change with the times.  And so now we used to have reading writing and arithmetic, but now I think we got three more R's: respect, responsibility, and--respect, responsibility, and resources.  And with those things you engage the community, engage parents and it will work.  That's what we're about.  We are about engagement so that we can make sure that every kid has access to a great public school because it is a basic right.  So that's what we have done as an organization.  Now I think people many people see us as a different organization today because we are different.  But if there is one frustrating thing for me it is people who, who see us in 2007 the same as we were in two, in 1967.  There really not trying to find out if in fact the NEA [National Education Association] has is changed.  They just don't like us and as a result they want to do anything they can make us not effective.
Speaker 2: How well how much of an impact will the next president elected have as there--depending on the pardon that person they select as the head of the Department of Education?
Speaker 1: The next president will have a tremendous impact in terms of what happened in this country.  They will have the opportunity to possibly appoint two, one-anywhere from one to three Supreme Court Justices.  They will appoint a head of the Department of Education.  They will put a number of things in place.  A number of other boards and commissions that they have the ability to, to appoint.  A number of federal judges that they have the ability to appoint.  So it's, it's very important.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Very important.
Story_ID: 128672
Speaker 1: You head up an organization of 3.2 million members, could you just give us a brief history of that organization.
Speaker 2: Well we are 100, we are 150 years old.  We celebrated our 150th year, year of exist, exist, existence this past summer in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And about forty years ago the NEA [National Education Association], which was a predominantly all-white organization, merged with the American Teachers Association, which was a black organization.  And, and they merged and, and, we now are one organization.  We are an organization consisting of teachers, support staff, okay those custodians, janitors, bus drivers, higher ed, students, and retirees.  They, they, make up our membership, and so that's, that's who, that's who we represent.  And again we have an affiliate in every, in every state and every state has local affiliates.  So that's, that's the makeup of the NEA.  And we have a staff at the NEA building, we have a staff of about, about 555 people.  And that are--consist of the chief, the executive director John Wilson.  And, and then and down to the, the plant workers then the physical plant workers.  And everybody does a, for the most part, they do an outstanding job.
Story_ID: 128673
Speaker 1: Your mom [Mary Alice Robinson Buchanan], before she passed, was able to see you rising up to great heights.  How did she feel about that?
Speaker 2: She felt very good, she felt very good.  This is the second year that we been without her I think I mentioned it.  And there have been some, some, some real significant things that have happened since mama been gone.  I have received two honorary doctorate degrees from universities.  One from Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina] and one from South Carolina State [University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].  And also this past summer I was, I was given a column with my name on it [an honorary degree from the University of Lincoln] at Lincoln Cathedral in Lincoln, England.  And that's very, that's very significant, and I know mom would have she would've she would've just loved it.  And, and, you know, you know, mom, you know, mom would cook that stuff, you know, greens and pork chops and chicken and chitterlings.  So I remember this, this past, this past holiday, Christmas time I had never, I had never clean chitlins before I never cooked them.  But I wanted me some chitlins, so I bought some of these pre-clean chitterlings.  And I cleaned them until they was almost none left, but I cleaned them.  And then I cooked them, and I gotta tell you, man when I sat down and ate some I thought of mama because it tasted just like the chitlins she cooked.  Mama, mama would've been pleased she'd have said, boy, you did a good (laughter).
Speaker 1: She would've been proud of your cooking.
Speaker 2: She sure would have, she sure would have (laughter).
Story_ID: 128674
Speaker 1: And let's talk about your wife [Betty Jo Moppin] a little bit what does she do?
Speaker 2: Well she's retired now she was a nurse.  She started out nursing at I think she started out Hines Hospital in Chicago [sic Edward Hines, Jr. VA Hospital, Maywood, Illinois].  And then she ended up--she ended her career working for Blue Cross Blue Shield, I think no, United Healthcare.  So she retired from United Healthcare.  She's born and raised in Danville, Illinois, we went to high school together.  And so we got married in 1963 and, then we lived in Chicago [Illinois] with the boys [Reginald Von Weaver and Rowan Anton Weaver] once we had the boys.
Speaker 1: And you, you're--I'm gonna ask you about your siblings.  The two [sic three] brothers, what, what do they do and how are they (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Karl [Weaver], Karl is (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: How are they doing?
Speaker 2: They're doing fine, Karl is--I think he does substitute teaching, but then he also is an entrepreneur on the side, you know.  He, he sells a number of things that meets the needs of people, okay.  Wigs, chitterlings, (laughter).  Dewey [Buchanan], Dewey, he's off into his own.  He's done a number of thing, I think he, he supposed to be a minister.  Mike [Buchanan] is the youngest he's also he has his own business a travel agency something like that.  So they're good they're good, good guys, (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Good guys.
Story_ID: 128675
Speaker 1: And the, if you had to pick one thing to be most remembered for what, what would that be?  You personally.
Speaker 2: The desire to--that, that I treat people right, I treat people right.  And, and demand that people have their rights respected and protected. That I was a man of integrity, and a man that tried to make sure that kids all kids not just some but all kids have what they need to be successful in order that they be productive for the 21st century.
Story_ID: 128676
Speaker 1: And before I go to the next question I did leave out one thing, and that was your two, two boys.  How are they doing and what are they doing?
Speaker 2: Oh, they're doing fine.  [Reginald] Von [Weaver] he, he works for William Blair [& Company].  He's, he was in North Carolina for, for a couple three, four, five years.   And he went, both of them went to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And so they, he works at William Blair.  And Rowan [Anton Weaver], he, he, he's always wanted to be a barber.  I taught actually I taught both of my kids how to cut hair to earn money, you know, when they went to college.  And, and Rowan always wanted to be a barber.  But he put barber school off to go to college and so when he graduated from college he got to working for somebody and it wasn't working out right.  So he said I want to go to the barber school.  So he went the barber school.  So he, he's now a barber and probably making more money than all of us, all right.  But he, he, he's good, he, he's good.
Speaker 1: Where is he located?
Speaker 2: Seventy-ninth, he works at Bullseye Barber shop, 79th, 79th street in Chicago [Illinois](simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then, and then again, I told you about my friend Hunter.  Hunter's a good barber so I don't know if they will ever--if Hunter would ever allow Rowan to work in his barber shop.  Rowan, Rowan's, a good barber, probably he'd like to get his own shop.  But those two cats they, they are, they're mean a lot.
Speaker 1: Did Hunter teach you?
Speaker 2: Actually, no.  When I, when, when, the day I went to college the night before I went to college me and my cousin--I told you my cousin Kenny was a wrestler.  We cut each other's hair, had never cut hair before.  We went down there patched up.  With the head all patch, patched up, you know, so from then on I started to cut hair.  And cut a lot of hair down there for, for the guys to make some money.  And so now I cut my own hair and got all the tools and so forth.
Speaker 1: Is there anything that we may have left out or I may have left out or neglected to ask you about that you'd like me to ask you about?
Speaker 2: I think, I think you, you did pretty good about asking about everything.  I can't, I can't think of anything.
Story_ID: 128677
Speaker 1: The NEA [National Education Association] now we have 3.2 million members, but it didn't always used to be that way.  There used to be the, the NEA, which was consisted primarily of, of white teachers and then you had the, the American Teachers Association, which were educators mostly in the South.  And those individuals consisted mostly of teachers and principals.  And so many of the conditions that were existing in education they thought that it would be best if in fact those, those conditions could be addressed in an integrated fashion.  And, and that's when the American Teachers Association and the National Teachers Association entered into talks to see if in fact they could become one.  And at the time both organizations primarily only had teachers.  The--and, and both organizations may have had some administrators.  When the two joined, I know many of the black administrators, and many of the black teachers lost their jobs because of, of--when they merged.  Some of, some of the schools that they merged into were some of the systems that they merged into may have did away with some of the jobs that the black teachers had.  So it may not, in the eyes of some, it may not have been the best move for some black teachers or some black administrators.  Some black administrators who may have been principles may have been moved from administrative to teacher.  And, and the merged group, and, and, in the, in the association you had, in some associations you had if in fact officers were elected.  One year they had to be certain positions had to be held by blacks.  And then the alternate year it had to be held by whites.  Now that still exists in one or two of our affiliates, and so as the two organizations came together as the NEA.  Then the question became who is the NEA going to be made up of, is it only gonna be made up of teachers?  There more people working in schools than just teachers.  And so I think in the early, mid-'80s [1980s] we started to look at education support professionals.  Janitors, bus drivers, custodians and we, we said okay we want them to be a part.  So we, we changed our governing documents to be able to admit education support professionals, all right.  Now, the students and retirees they're not active members because students are not yet in the profession and retirees are out of the profession.  So there's a category of membership for students and, and for retirees.  But not active, active members would be those who are teaching in the schools on a regular basis.  And so as we moved from, from that period of time till now we do have those members making up the profession.  Again there are some states maybe one or two states that do not accept support staff as active members.  So that means either they have a chance to be members in one capacity or not.  Another area that we really wanna get into and we, we will be looking at getting into is the pre-k area, pre-kindergarten.  So, you know, we have some documents that we have to follow.  And if in fact that we want to change those documents to include and be more inclusive of people who now are outside of our organization we'd have to do that.  People outside of the organization are those primarily that work in, in the many of the, like, you know, the fireman, the police, nurses in many instances.  Those individuals are not able to be a part of our organization.  So we think that we are an organization of educators, and that's the way that we have operated in terms of our membership.  So the future, you know, times again, as I indicated times changing and we may, we may change again to be more inclusive of other groups that are now outside our organization.
Story_ID: 128678
Speaker 1: Okay, I wanna go back to the question of your legacy, what would you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Like your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I don't know man.  I don't know, I think that there are, I don't know, I think there are a lot of things.  But, but, you know, you know here, here's a person that tried to make a difference and tried to get others to see the value of making a difference for all kids because those kids are gonna have to take our place.  And if in fact their gonna take our place they have to be good.  And the only way that the kids can be good, and the only way that this country can survive and continue to be the country of the future is for its citizens to be educated.  And If in fact we're going to compete all three hundred million of us if we're gonna compete in a global economy with 6.5 million or billion and compete with India and China primarily.  Then our kids are gonna have to be educated, and we have to do that.  So, you know, in terms of my legacy, I don't know.  I mean, I just, I just try to get it done.  And so I would imagine--I mean in terms of things that we've done--already is there.  I mean we, we are really--as the kids say we are slamming and jamming in the organization we are doing so many things that we typically have not done.  And some of it is risk taking but yeah sometimes in order to get stuff done you gotta take the risk.  And if in fact you wanted to make sure that people understand the need for all kids, you gotta speak up.  You know, you got, you gotta speak up so, you know, as I, as I tell our folks as I end up speaking, you know.  I said if you think you're beaten you are if you think you dare not you don't.  If you'd like to win, but you think you can't it's almost a cinch you won't.  Life's battles don't go to the swift or a faster person.  But sooner or later the person who wins is the person who thinks they got it.  I think all of our folks are winners.  But, you know what it doesn't matter what I think.  It's what they think, and I tell the kids if your mind can conceive it, and you believe it you can achieve it.  You can achieve anything that you want.  And then, you know, a lot of times people will consider us to be a special interest group, you know.  And I tell our folks, sometimes they want to shy away oh no, no, no, in way we're not.  Don't shy away from that any longer because you are a special interest group and your special interest happens to be children and public education.  You gotta stand up, and you gotta speak up and you gotta speak out that's what you gotta do.  And when you do that people are still gonna castigate you there is gonna try to pretend as though you're losers.  They're gonna try to do everything to put you down.  And so I tell them folks when all of that happened just remember when things go wrong and they sometimes will and when the road you're trudging seems all uphill.  When the funds are low, and the debts are high and you want to smile but you have to sigh. And care is pressing you down a bit Rest if you must but doggone it don't you ever quit.  And then to those folks that are not members I say, you know, who joined.  You know, if your part of an organization and they don't want to do nothing say are you an active member.  The kind that would be missed or are you just contended that your name is on the list?  Do you attend the make meetings and mingle with the flock or stay at home to criticize and knock?  Do you take an active part to help the work alone or are you satisfied to only just belong.  Do you get--do you work with the committees and get right in and mix or leave the work to just a few and talk about the cliques.  Thinking of a member, you know, right from wrong are you an active member or do you just belong (laughter).
