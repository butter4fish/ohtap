Speaker 1: Let's talk about your, your ancestry.  And I'd like to begin with your mother and your mother's side of the family.  Can you tell me your mother's name, spell it for me, and tell me where and when she was born?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Daisy Mae Reels [Daisy Reels Prince].  She was born in Guthrie, Oklahoma.  She was born May the 3rd, 1926.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did she share any stories about her growing up in Guthrie?
Speaker 2: She shared with me about how being a young female in an all-black school, what some of the challenges were when she went across town to the, to the white part of town and couldn't understand some of the things that they were saying and some of the things that they were doing and why they were treating them in some of the manners that they were treating them.
Speaker 1: Did her family live in the city, or did they live in the, on a farm, in the country?
Speaker 2: Basically, we lived in a, in a little old two room, three room house with a outhouse in the back.  It's kind of the way they lived back, back in those days.
Story_ID: 617713
Speaker 1: And her parents, tell me about her parents.  What were their names?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was--[maternal] grandmother's name was Lillian [Lillian Prince].  She was a housewife, very strong, very firm, very loving young lay--lady that I grew to love very, very much.  And the only grandfather that I knew from my mother [Daisy Reels Prince] was Grant Prince, which was a, a very Christian man, entrepreneur, taught me my, my work habits in regards to--with my father [A.C. Prince, Sr.]--but in regards to what it take to, to survive in today's society.  And the best way to get ahead or to do things would be able to, to work, to, to work for what you, what you want, work for what you get.  So my grandfather, I loved very, very much.  He lived a, a very, very spiritual and, and entrepreneurial spirit life.
Speaker 1: And what did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: Well, he, he had a trash truck.  He had a grocery store.  He cut yards.  He built buildings.  He was a masonry.  My granddad was similar to me.  Some of the things that I, I do and some of the things that he taught me and some of the things that my father taught me, was my granddad tried to, tried to diversify himself to be able to raise his family and support for his grandchildren and, and things of that nature.  So from, from brick masonry to, to driving a, a trash truck to--on private properties--to, to working in the oil refinery to owning a grocery store to building churches, things of that nature, my granddaddy believed in, in hard work.
Speaker 1: What was your personal relationship like with your, your grandfather?  Did, as a child, did you visit them and have time, maybe some one on one time with your grandfather?
Speaker 2: I really don't believe from the time I was knee deep to, to sixteen that there was a week that passed that I didn't speak to my grandfather.  My grandfather was an instrumental spirit to me in regards to making sure I stayed on the right path, making sure I stayed in the church.  He was an elder and a deacon, and, and sometimes he had to preach the sermons.  My grandfather was the one that told me that at a young age, you need to get out and start being able to make a living because you're the sixth of so many children.  And, and, and my conversations with him was, was about education because he didn't have a strong formal education, but he wanted me to get a, a strong formal education.  Then he wanted me to learn how to, to take that education, twist it with hard work, and be able to survive in what he called the white man's society.
Speaker 1: Did your grandparents own the land that they lived on?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My, my, my grandfather built the home that he lived in Enid, Oklahoma, and that home still exists today.  And he built it out of concrete.  And then as we outgrew the little small home, then we built a, a little, another section on the back of it.  He built it with brick.  My grandfather believed in not having to pay anybody for doing things for him that he was doing himself.  And if he didn't know how to do it, he'd read up on it, learn how to do it himself.  And that's kind of the, the spirit I, I try to lead today.
Story_ID: 617714
Speaker 1: Do you have any information about your great-grandparents, where they might have come from?  Was there any talk of any of your family being in slavery?
Speaker 2: On my mother's [Daisy Reels Prince] side there was Oscar [Oscar Reels] and, and Menthie Reels.  Oscar was a, was a half Indian [Native American] and half black.  I think he kind of dodged the slavery, but, but my great-grandmother Menthie was, was, was a dark complexion, black African American lady that dealt with all the vibes of growing up, all the vibes of, of, of slavery, all the vibes of picking cotton, and, and, and, and corn, and working the fields.  And, and she taught me that--and taught my mother and my, and, and my grandmother [Lillian Prince] what grit meant.  And when you say grit that means that you learn to, to turn the other cheek when spited, but you also learn to be strong when need to be.  So my great-grandmother and my great-grandfather, Oscar and Menthie Reels, both--she died in, in 1956; I believe he died in 1957.  So I was able to spend some time with them during my upbringing years.  And, and it was a true reward to be able to see how those old folks went from the 1800s and the 1880s and 1890s to the 1950s and the changes that they saw, and the Civil Rights Movement, the slavery movements, the, the slave acquisition of land movements and things of that nature.  So, the amazing stories that they told me over the years still live with me today.
Speaker 1: Can you share some of those stories that they told you?  Can you think of maybe just one story that they told you?
Speaker 2: One is when, when, when my grandfather [sic. great-grandfather] told me, he says, "Son, I tried to pass for Indian," because he was a light complexioned black African American with a little bit of Indian in him.  He said, "I tried to pass for Indian because Indians was getting free land.  That mean, that meant that I didn't have to do any slave duties to be able to get some slave land."  So he tried to pass for an Indian to be able to get some land.  So he was able to get a little old bitty piece of land up in Guthrie [Oklahoma] that allowed him to be able to build a little cabin on.  And then from that cabin became a house.  And then that cabin is no longer there.  That house is no longer there in Guthrie today.  But that's how he was able to raise his, his, his children.  And, and my, my grandmother was, was a young, young mother.  So my, my, my grandfather taught us, hey, it's time to, to, to step above certain things and, and be able to accomplish certain things.  But he says that "I, I went as an Indian so that I could get some land to be able to, to build a home for my family."  It sunk in on me on, on--how in those types of situations and in those years, how we were still disenfranchised in, in certain avenues of growing up.
Story_ID: 617715
Speaker 1: Describe your mother [Daisy Reels Prince] to me.  Tell me what type of person she was and about your relationship with your mother.
Speaker 2: My mother was probably one of the sternest ladies I, lady I've ever met.  My mother at one time, we had eight children in the house, and you could eat off the floor.  When we'd come to the table to eat, we had to eat everything on our plates or hear the wraths of our mother.  My mother taught us all to get an education.  She taught us all to be, be, be (clears throat) independent amongst ourselves.  But, but I can remember that I probably got a, a spanking from my mother maybe once a week or, or so when I was growing up.  She was a taskmaster.  She believed in, in respect.  She believed that when we had guests in the house that the children had to take a backseat to the guests.  She believed that when we get out of the bed we had to make it up.  She believed that even though we might have had one pair of blue jeans or, or one pair of tennis shoes, that we had to take care of those because of the grit that it take, or it took for us to, to be able to accomplish that.  My, my mother died at a very young age.  And I really don't know whether or not she was happy, but I know that she was tough on her children, to the point to where all of us now have, have reaped those rewards and learned, hopefully, what it takes to be good adults.
Speaker 1: What characteristic do you believe you obtained from your mother?
Speaker 2: No nonsense.  I believe that my mother was a no nonsense person.  And the way I tried to, to go through life is, is to be straightforward.  People don't really have to worry about where I'm coming from because 99 percent of the time I'll tell them.  I think I learned that characteristic from my mother in regards to she was no nonsense.  She believed in, in, in what you see is what you get.
Story_ID: 617716
Speaker 1: Tell me about your, your father.  Tell me his name; spell it for me please; and tell me where and when he was born, born.
Speaker 2: My father's name was A.C. Prince, just as it sounds, A.C., which meant for nothing, just A.C. Prince, Sr.  My father was born September the 20th, 1920, probably my best friend in life.  My father was probably one of the sweetest, kindest, most gentle man that I've ever met.  The love that I have for my father relaxes with me every day.  My father was, was a person that, that didn't believe that his wife was supposed to work, so my mother [Daisy Reels Prince] was a housewife, even though we had a tremendous amount of, of, of siblings and kids in the house and the neighborhood kids in the house.  My father was a retired military man, fought in World War II [WWII].  And he went to work as a, as, in the civil service, but he also worked cleaning buildings and cutting grass, whatever it took to be able to support his family and, and meet some of the urgent needs of, of my mother.  My father taught me how to cook.  My father taught me the basics of, of life, commonsense.  I think that if my father was living today, he'd be proud of me.  I, I, I, I truly believe it, because he told me when he died, he said, "Son, I want you to be able to make sure that your family and your sisters and your brothers and, and everybody is all happy, and, and, and, and, and adjusting, and, and, and taken care of because I didn't, I didn't and wasn't able."  And he said it just like that: "I didn't and I wasn't able to finish the journey."  My father worked himself to death.  I think my father averaged an hour--I mean no more than three to four hours of sleep a day all the times that I can remember, and he died at age fifty-four.  So I've already, I've already outlived my father.  But to see a man to get up in the morning at six o'clock in the morning, he hit the ground running.  And, and two, three o'clock in the morning he lays down to go to bed.  Then he gets back up at six o'clock in the morning and starts over.  That means he went to work at Tinker Air Force Base [Oklahoma City, Oklahoma] or Vance Air Force Base [Oklahoma] in the daytime.  He'd have a second job, whether it be working in the service station or, or, or cleaning a building.  And then he would go and clean up another building, or he'd work in some facet of a manner to where he could get some income, because he knew that, that with his limited education, he had to work to be able to, to maintain a study steady stream of income for his children.  And I cherish his memory.  My father was, was, was, was a great man.
Story_ID: 617717
Speaker 1: Did he talk to you or share any stories about his growing up?  Where did you say he grew up?
Speaker 2: My father [A.C. Prince, Sr.] grew up in what they called the bottom, Elmore City, Oklahoma, pecan fields, cotton fields, raising cows, chicken.  His father was a farmer.  My, my father's mother died when he was six months old, so he never got the opportunity to, to know his mother.  My, my father took a strong credence to ladies.  That's why all of my sisters, he wanted to make sure that they were well taken care of because he never had the opportunity to love and cherish his mother.  My, my father was, was, was--when he'd start talking about working in those fields and raising cattle and, and, and, and chopping wheat and picking corn and, and, and, and, and all those things that he had to do when he was growing up, to the point to where he wasn't able to go get a, a former education.  I think he dropped out of school when he was like in the sixth or seventh grade because he had to work the fields.  He had to help his father be able to, to handle the crop, the cattle.  He was raised on a farm.  He got tired of that, so to speak, and went and joined the [U.S. military] service, stayed in the service for a while, and, and then he retired from that.  And then he, then he said, "I'll be a civil service person; I'll work for the government."  My father was, was, was a blessing.  If anybody can say a blessing, I had that blessing.
Speaker 1: What was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Ora Franklin [Ora Franklin Prince].
Speaker 1: Okay, and your grandfather?
Speaker 2: Sherman Prince.
Speaker 1: Do you know whether they owned the land that they worked, that they farmed on?
Speaker 2: My grandfather received the land as part of a slave deal.  So, in essence, his fathers were slaves, and, and, and, and he was able to get the, the land through what they called a Freedman Treaty [Treaty of 1866], so to a point to where they gave all the Princes down in the country so many acres of land.  And that's how my father was able to--grandfather was able to, to acquire the land that, that he, he, he, he had.  And we still have some of it today, not all of it, but, but we still have some of it today.
Speaker 1: Do you know your great-grandparents, the ones that were--well, even your grandparents that were in slavery, the Prince family?
Speaker 2: Not--I've heard stories, but I, I think my, my intuitiveness stopped at my, my, my grandfather on, on that side.
Story_ID: 617718
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your mother [Daisy Reels Prince] and father [A.C. Prince, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My, my, my father, when his mother [Ora Franklin Prince] passed, he went to live with my grandfather's [Sherman Prince] brother.  My grandfather's brother--and this is--I don't know how all these happened back then, but my, my grandfather's brother's son married my [maternal] grandmother [Lillian Prince].  And my father met my, my mother through that relationship, and, and they started dating at a young age.  And, and I guess the rest is history because they spent, oh, forty something years together before she passed and he passed.
Speaker 1: Where did your mother and father settle down?  Where did they live once they got married?
Speaker 2: We moved around a little bit because my father was in civil service.  When he came back, we lived in, in Guthrie [Oklahoma], which is where my mother was from.  And then we lived in Lawton, Oklahoma, which was where the Fort Sill base is.  And my father worked there as a civil service.  Then he transferred to Vance Air Force Base in Enid, Oklahoma.  And we lived in Enid for, for, for some years, and, and my father worked for civil service at Vance Air Force Base.  And then when we left Enid we came to Oklahoma City [Oklahoma].  My father worked at Tinker Air Force Base in, in Oklahoma City and until he got in poor health.  So we, we were not military brats, but we were civil service children brats, so to speak.
Story_ID: 617719
Speaker 1: Think back and, and tell me what is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory is I guess I was about three or four years old.  And, and we were having church by the creek.  And in the middle of the service, I had on my Sunday go to meeting clothes, which was a pair of blue jeans and a dress shirt and a pair of tennis shoes.  I think that I, I'd outgrew the tennis shoes, so we cut the toe out of them now.  Back then when you outgrow them you cut the toe out of them and, and kept wearing them.  And I got a little rambunctious, and I went and jumped in the water with my Sunday go to meeting clothes on I guess at age three, maybe four.  And my mother [Daisy Reels Prince] stopped the church sermon to dress me down.  So that was probably one of my most remor- memorable experiences, because I had to apologize to the whole church congregation at age three, maybe four, my intuitiveness to go over to jump in the water while the preacher was preaching.  I won't do that anymore.
Story_ID: 617720
Speaker 1: Tell me about your, your siblings.  And can you tell me their names in order of birth and where you fit in?
Speaker 2: Well, that's a bunch (laughter).  My oldest sister, her name's Doris.  Her name's Doris Prince Smith.  She's sixty-three, going on sixty-four.  She works with me at the, Prince and Associates [Dallas, Texas] after she retired, a very kind, loving sister.  My brother, my next to--it's twelve of us now.  My, my brother, Wilbur [Wilbur Prince], which is I believe sixty-two, and he lives in Los Angeles, California.  He's retired, but he's still doing some entrepreneurial spirits to be able to add to his income.  My sister, Elgia [Elgia Prince Owens], I believe she's sixty-one.  She has a twin brother, which is named A.C. Prince, Jr.  Elgia works for me.  She's our CFO of the company, has been working for me since 1986, since day one.  I don't know what I'd do without her.  Her twin brother is kind of lost.  We communicate with him very little.  He's, last I heard, he was in the Carolinas and, and doing some chef work.  Then I have a brother, Orville [Orville Prince].  Orville is sixty.  He lives in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma].  I speak to him almost every other day.  He and I are pretty close 'cause we grew up pretty (cough) pretty close.  He's a manager of a feed company in, in, in Oklahoma City.  Then I fall in next to him, at fifty-eight.  I'm the sixth of twelve.  I'm the baby boy, so my brothers and older sisters kind of looked at me as their little baby.  But I look at them as my babies.  Then I have a sister, Darlene [Darlene Prince Jones].  She's fifty-six, fifty-seven.  She lives in Oklahoma City.  Her and I are real close.  We kind of grew up together.  She used to steal my car and drive it all over town when I didn't know she, she had it when I was practicing basketball and some things like that or in school.  She's a executive with Hertz [The Hertz Corporation] up there.  My--next to her would be my sister, Colleen [Colleen Prince Taylor].  Coleen is, (makes sound), Colleen is about fifty-four, fifty-five, lives in Carbondale, Illinois.  She has a, a master's degree in psychology.  People seem to think that she's too smart for her own good.  Then after that, Colleen was the baby for many years and then came along four little sisters, which would be Ora [Ora Prince], which is named after my father's mother [Ora Franklin Prince].  She was born 1960, so.  She's kind of drifted, and drifted, and drifted.  We tried to keep my hands on her as much as possible.  Then after Ora comes Avis [Avis Prince Sadler], we call her Nell.  She was a track star.  She's a--has worked me some in, in my restaurants, and she kind of floats back and forth between Dallas [Texas] and Oklahoma City.  She's looking forward to me opening up the restaurant up there so she could possibly run it.  Then I have Sherri [Sherri Prince Shepherd].  Sherri lives here in Dallas.  Sherri is kind of a private duty nurse that takes care of an elderly young lady.  She's been doing that for the same, same, I say older lady for probably fifteen, sixteen years.  And then my baby sister, which is Shanton [Shanton Prince Harris], she's in Phoenix, Arizona, and she works for the school board out there as a counselor or, or takes care of the kids when they, when they get out of line.  So, I'm the sixth of twelve children.  All the children and all my brothers and sisters are still living.  We still get together as much as possible.  So if you've ever seen a big family, I've got one.
Story_ID: 617721
Speaker 1: Talk to me about your early days, your elementary school days.  Tell me where you were living when you started first grade.
Speaker 2: First grade I was living in Enid, Oklahoma.  My first grade teacher, I can still remember Ms., Ms. Young [ph.].  I can remember my fourth grade teacher, Ms. West [ph.].  Those were good days, going to an all-black elementary school, Carver Elementary School [George Washington Carver Elementary School, Enid, Oklahoma], walking past the general store and getting some candy for six for a penny.  And, and you know, those were, those were days that, that I cherish, walking to school and, and, and building a friendship with, with, with the other children in, in, in that all-black elementary school that some of us still communicate today.  I mean that's, that's really unbelievable.
Story_ID: 617722
Speaker 1: Take me on a, a tour of your community, of your neighborhood where you lived.  From your house maybe do a, a square block, and tell me who lives on the block, who your friends were, and maybe what their parents might have done for a living, if you know.
Speaker 2: Well, you go back there and there's a, there's the Porters that I, I grew up with in Enid, Oklahoma.  Mr. Porter [ph.] was a, was a local policeman.  There's the Kellys that I grew up with in Enid, Oklahoma, and Mr. Kelly was a local policeman.  And now Skip [Ronald "Skip" Kelly] is a city councilman in, in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma].  I grew up with the Frasiers [ph.], which was another big family similar to ours; the Mitchells, which was a, another big family similar to ours.  In the Mitchells have, you have Leona Mitchell.  She's a famous opera singer.  So my, my, my little neighborhood in, in Enid, Oklahoma, from, from the Escos, that Richard Esco was a, was a big football player up there, and, and Cecil Spencer [ph.], which was a good friend of ours.  All, all of us was in--the Newtons [ph.].  All of us still communicate today from, from my grade school [George Washington Carver Elementary School, Enid, Oklahoma].  And we left Enid in, in 1960, but we were still able to go back because my [maternal] grandmother [Lillian Prince] lived there.  So we had some ties there where we're able to go back and, and, and still visit some of my old classmates and old teachers and things like that.  So, my early childhood days in Enid, Oklahoma, I was there from the first grade to, to the first part of the fifth grade, and then I--we moved to Oklahoma City.  But there are some beautiful people that I grew up in Enid, Oklahoma.
Story_ID: 617723
Speaker 1: Tell me more about, about the town and the community.  You talked about stopping at the candy store to buy candy on the way to school.  Tell me about the other merchants and things that were going on in the town, where you shopped, and what games you might have played with your friends, and if you were involved in any extracurricular activities.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  There was Booker T. Washington High School [Enid, Oklahoma], which was an all-black high school.  And then there was Carver [George Washington Carver Elementary School, Enid, Oklahoma], which was the elementary school.  And we had to go by Ms. Fields' [ph.] grocery store in Enid, Oklahoma, on our way to and from school.  And Ms. Fields was a middle aged merchant that allowed us to have credit, allowed my parents [Daisy Reels Prince and A.C. Prince, Sr.] to have credit.  She was able to, to fill the needs of the black community with, with groceries, because back then we couldn't go down to the local Tom's Market [Tom Thumb] or the local Walmart [Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.], so to speak, or Safeways [Safeway Inc.].  So, Ms. Fields would then order in what we needed, put it in a bag, and my mother would tell me sometimes on my way home from, from, from, from grade school, "Stop by Ms., Ms. Fields, and she'll have a bag for us," to bring it home, or my [maternal] grandmother [Lillian Prince] would say the same thing.  But Ms. Fields would also allow us to come in there and--I guess it was the way to keep us from stealing, that she would say, "Get what you need.  I'll run you a, a bill, and you kids go out and bring me some bottles, some cans."  Back then, the, the little liter Cokes [Coca-Cola] was very, very prominent: "Bring me some bottles, some cans, and some, some aluminum, some tops," or, or, or maybe, "Cut my tree," or, "Cut my grass," or, "Pick, pick some peaches or things of the tree," if we didn't have the money to be able to pay for it.  So Ms. Fields had a special place in all of the children's hearts in, in Enid, Oklahoma, because, to be totally honest with you, if she didn't give us some of that stuff, probably 50 percent of us were so poor that we'd probably be stealing.  But she eliminated that burden, because we knew that we could go in and ask for what we wanted, and she wouldn't say no.  And if she didn't have it, she'd get it for us.  This was a little small black grocery store in the black community.  But it catered to us, and it was able to meet all of our needs that, that the little black community needed. To where if we went over to the local white supermarket, we'd have to stand outside or wait in line or they wouldn't wait on us.  So it, it eliminated the, the peer pressures of, of, of us being rejected, by driving all the way across town or walking all the way across town and still not be able to get what we needed.  So, we used to say that Ms. Fields became rich.  But I don't think Ms. Fields was rich, because I think she gave back to the community.  I think she--with, with the little money that she made out of the grocery store, I believe that she also put it back into the community and gave the kids some things that, that kept us all grounded, so to speak.  That's, that's, that's something that the kids need now.  Instead of running to the Walmarts and things like that, I think if they had a local grocery store that, that catered to the needs and, and understood the, what we need as, as young, young children, I think it would be a better, better society today.  I can remember the little caramel swirls and the, and, and the hot suckers and, and, and, and the little candy bars that, that she didn't jack the price up on us.  I mean we could go in there and get those caramel swirls for three for a penny, and, and, and, or go in there and get a, a candy bar, two for ten cents, go over on the other side of town, it might be a white price of two for ten cents, but the black price was, was, was one for fifteen cents.  So, we were able to see the value of Ms. Fields and understand her place in, in, in, in the community.

Speaker 1: What about the other activities that you might have participated in?  Were there any sports or any type of activities that you might have been involved in?
Speaker 2: Where I grew up, if you didn't play basketball, football, and baseball, you couldn't live in those communities.  They'd put a dress on you (cough) literally.  I started playing basketball probably when I was four or five years old.  I started playing baseball the same.  My father [A.C. Prince, Sr.] was, was a baseball advocate.  Back then, the black sport was baseball.  I started playing football at a young age.  I excelled at baseball because that was what my father pushed me to because my father believed that baseball was the, was the black sport back then.  So I became a pitcher.  I became a catcher.  I become a--I became a first baseman.  I could probably hit a baseball a country mile.  You know, back then, when we're in grade school, the fence wasn't that far.  And I was tall and lanky, and I could hit the ball over the fence and, and jump and around the, the, the field and, and have some fun.  And then I developed a strong talent with basketball, which, which I turned out to be a pretty good basketball player.  Football was probably my weakest sport because I didn't like to be hit; I liked to hit, but in football, they hit you back, so, so.  In the young age--younger days when I was growing up in Enid, Oklahoma, I started playing baseball, basketball, and football in the fields.  We'd go out there and make, make our own baseball field and cut us a path.  I learned to catch balls in between weeds.  We, we made our, our football fields also in the fields.  And I can remember times that, that I'd get tackled on the, on hay and straw.  And, and they'd cut me more than, than, than, than the tackle or bruise me more than the tackle.  And then when we made out basketball goals, we made--our basketball goals on a dirt, dirt surface.  There was no concrete.  We'd, we'd get a peach basket, cut the peach basket out, make a rim out of it, and put it on the back of a, of a wooden board, and that's how I learned to play basketball.  Lo and behold, I didn't realize that I would become a pretty good basketball player and a pretty good baseball player.  But those were the roots; that's how we got started.  Everybody, young men and lady, in our neighborhoods played sports.  That was a family requirement that we play sports and go to church.
Speaker 1: Who were your, your leaders in sports?  Do you remember who organi- was it organized?  Was there a parent that--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh no.
Speaker 1: --would organize?  Or who would, who would be the organizer of your teams?
Speaker 2: My, my father would work a little bit.  My [maternal] grandfather [Grant Prince] would work a little bit, (cough), excuse me.  All the family and all the parents in the community would work a little bit with us.  There was nothing organized back, back in those years.  We would probably organize it ourselves, and we'd probably be more like organized by streets.  If you lived on State Street, if you lived on Wabash Street [sic. Wabash Avenue], or if you lived on Market [Street] or whatever, then Market Street would play the State Street; the State Street would play the Wabash Street, or, or, or vice versa.  It would be more set up by streets than anything that were--we were all at a pretty even age.  And then with me being the fourth son and my older brothers and, and I'm being the younger brother, I played with some of the--my brothers' competitors, and, and that made me a little bit tougher than when I came back down and played with my age group.  So I developed a little bit quicker.  But, but as far as anything organized, I can't remember any organized ball in, in, that I participated in, in Enid, Oklahoma.  I guess the first organized ball that I participated in is when I went to Oklahoma City [Oklahoma].
Story_ID: 617725
Speaker 1: You also mentioned church.  And now you, you told us a story about falling in the, the creek or jumping in the creek by the church.  What was the name of that church, because that was in what city?
Speaker 2: It was Guthrie [Oklahoma].
Speaker 1: Guthrie.  And you said the church was outside.  So tell me about why it was outside and--
Speaker 2: Well, you know--
Speaker 1: --what type of church it was.  What was the name of the church?
Speaker 2: I, basically, I, I--
Speaker 1: Don't remember (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) can't remember the name of the church.  But I'm not that old, but, but I can go back a long ways.  And when you look at church back then, we were having tent services.  We, we, we'd have a tent put up when we'd go out and sit with the chairs, and, and the preacher would come and preach.  And, and that's kind of like an old time revival, tent service.  Those are the days that I can remember.  I can't remember going into a, basically, an organized church with a building and walls until I was probably six or seven years old.  But in my younger years I can remember, three and four (cough) and five, church was in, out by the creek, with a tent, because the water would create the coolness.  In the wintertime, we'd go up closer to the house because we'd be able to, to feel a little bit of warmth from the, from the elements from there.  But, but my early childhood days from, from church, I'd say a tent experience with all denominations, the Baptist, the, the Holiness, and the Protestants.  And all of us would get together up under a tent, and then it would rotate the, the, the preachers.  Back then, those were the, the early days that I could remember and the--I can't remember coming into an actual church house until I moved to Enid, Oklahoma. And, and my [maternal] grandfather [Grant Prince] built the church that we attended.
Story_ID: 617726
Speaker 1: It was the Church of Christ [Garriott Road Church of Christ, Enid, Oklahoma].  My [maternal] grandfather [Grant Prince] built that church with, with masonry blocks and, and built it by himself so that we would have a place to, to, to go to church.  The white man tricked him out of the church.  I really don't know how because he owned that church.  But, but he built that church, and then when he joined the Church of Christ, they figured out some type of way to put it into all of, the, the Church of Christ, the denominations.  And then eventually they took over the church.  But it didn't dampen his spirits, because went and built another church.  This one he, he built out of wood and not masonry blocks.  He built it out of wood because he wanted it to get up quicker.  It was a smaller church, not as big as the one he built out of masonry blocks though.  Those were my younger years of, of going from the, the creek, the tent, to my grandfather's church, to the white man taking my grandfather's church when it became a Church of Christ, and then, and then him building another church.  My grandfather was, was probably the closest thing to a preacher in, in, in Enid, Oklahoma, those days.  And everybody looked up to him as probably one of the, the, the most religious black African American man in Enid, Oklahoma.  They called him Diddy G [ph.].  I'll never forget that, because I don't know of too many people that didn't respect him.  And when he started talking the Bible we listened.  I used to sit around the table with my grandfather, and he'd talk--teach me Bible.  And then when we went to his church, my grandfather would get up and read the scriptures.  And whether we had a visiting minister or my grandfather was the acting minister that day, he would always make sure that we participated.  And it made no difference what time we got there.  If we thought we were gonna get late--get there late, to where we wouldn't have to participate, he'd always say, "Okay, Sonny, I need you to read scripture such and such.  Go find that scripture in that Bible."  And if you didn't have a Bible, he'd make sure you got one.  So, in essence, teaching you the Bible was, was a part of his form of education because he never had a formal education, but he knew the Bible like the palm of his hand.  So those, those are my early churching days.
Speaker 2: The second church that he built was--what denomination was it, or were all different denominations allowed to come into the church building?
Speaker 1: He built a church for the people, even though he was the elder or a deacon or whatever in the Church of Christ.  But the, the, the, but the last church that he built, he built it for all the people.  He built it for the black man and the white man or whoever wanted to come within the, the, the church to hear the sound of voice.  I, I didn't, I didn't see him turn anybody back that wanted to come into that church.  When he built that church, he says: "This is the house that the Lord built.  I'm just his servant."  I, I was amazed of his, his, his, his passion for life, because I was ready to go up there and fight and take that church back.  But my grandfather said, "No, that is not what we shall do.  What we shall do now, in spite of everything else, we will go build another church." And he started on that mission.  And my brothers and sisters and aunts and, and, and uncles, we were astound because we said, "Let's just go take the church back."  You know, we were, we were gonna do the, the rough, the rough, rough road of putting them out and taking it back because we knew that he built that church.  But my grandfather was the type of person that when he spoke, you listened, and when he said no, we respected him enough that where all of those rambunctious kids and, and, and, and, and grandkids of his did not act unaccordingly.  So, we worked with him to build this other church.  And we were just as happy in that small church as we was in the larger church.
Story_ID: 617727
Speaker 1: When you think back to that time, what sounds, what smells, and what sights take you back to that time?
Speaker 2: The sounds would be the siren sounds.  Every time we heard a siren, we thought that someone has come and beaten someone, or someone has came and took someone away.  It seems as though whenever there was a crime, both the black and the white police would come over on our side of town and just pick somebody up.  That was to solve the crime.  So, whenever we heard a siren or, or, or that type of noise, I would, I would just be at fret because I just wanted to make sure that it wasn't one of my brothers or, or sisters or uncles or aunts or close friends that were the choice of both the black police and the white police's decision makings for that day.  So, those were some of the fears that, that I had to, to experience from a sound of a, of a siren when I was growing in, in Enid, Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: What about a smell?
Speaker 2: The smell would be a smoke, because as a matter of respect, from what I was told, when a black man got out of line or when you looked at the white person wrong back then or, or you might have winked at a white girl back then, they would burn your house or set your car on fire.  So whenever we--or set our fields on fire, on fire that we played our, our games in, from our football fields to our, our basketball goals that we made out of wood and peach, peach baskets or, or, or baseball fields that, that we cut the straws out it, they would burn those.  When they felt like that we were getting too far advanced, they would burn those.  And, and, and we always would wonder why.  We were over there on our side of town, minding our own business.  Why would you come over and burn down our meeting place or fun places?  Because all that would do then is lead us to come over to your place.  So, the, the smell of smoke I still fret that today, the smell of, the smell of smoke.
Speaker 1: And what sights?
Speaker 2: I guess the, the sights that I like most is when I went to the country and, and could see the water just, just, just clear.  And I could see the fields full of blossom.  I can see the, the fruit on the, on, on, on the trees, because I knew then that we were free.  I knew then that if I wanted to go get a peach off my family's tree, if I wanted to go take me a shuck of corn, if I wanted to go pick some cotton, the, the, the sight of that was a, was a emblance of free to me, that, that we were there.  I was able to, to-- I mean some of the best tasting thing in the world is to get a, a shuck of corn and just crack into it or go get a fresh tomato.  I mean, those were some of the, the, the best tasting and the most beautiful things in the world when you can see your fruits of your labor become a tomato bush or, or a cornfield.  When I look at those sights today and I can--and I look at these fields today, there used to be food, vegetables, that are now homes, those sights are, are not the same; they're just not the same.
Story_ID: 617728
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about your elementary school.  Was there a name of the school that you went to?
Speaker 2: I went to Carver Elementary School [George Washington Carver Elementary School, Enid, Oklahoma].
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry.  You did tell me that.  And was there a teacher that might have been inspiring to you or someone that encouraged you?
Speaker 2: Leona B. Jones [ph.].  She was my first grade teacher.  She had to be one of the meanest ladies that you would ever witness.  But she also had a strong sense of love, because she taught the ABCs; she taught us how to count; she taught us how to spell; she taught us how to read; she taught us how to write.  She wouldn't pass you unless you learned all of those.  She had a reputation of flunking people.  But I can gracefully say that when I left her first grade, I was probably on a third or fourth grade level, because she was just that good.  Also, when I, when I moved to Oklahoma City [Oklahoma], I moved to Oklahoma City in the fifth grade, I went to Culbertson Elementary School in Oklahoma City.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.  What's the name of the school?
Speaker 2: Culbertson.  I went to Culbertson Elementary School in Oklahoma City.  And I had a fifth grade teacher named Ms. Clay, Aretha Clay.  Ms. Clay was, was a short, brown skinned lady, and was no nonsense that, that got me ready for, for junior high school.  My sixth grade was Mr. Kirk [Westley Kirk].  He was kind of laidback.  But, but I was probably more prepared when I left my fifth grade going into my sixth grade to get ready for Mr. Kirk, because Ms. Aretha Clay was really a, a strong educator.  She believed in, in making sure that we tested good.  And if we didn't test good, she'd work with us on an individual level to be able to assure that we adapted and understood.  And those were the, those are good teachers, because those teachers were, were the, were the type that would, that would take the extra mile, and it wasn't just for the paycheck.  It was to make sure that we grasped the knowledge that we needed to be able to survive in, in, in, in, in the world that we were getting ready to go out to.  Aretha Clay, my fifth grade teacher (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What type of student were you?
Speaker 2: I was pretty smart.  All of my family has been pretty smart.  My mother [Daisy Reels Prince] was pretty smart.  My father [A.C. Prince, Sr.] was pretty smart.  I didn't have to study that much.  I grasped things pretty, pretty good.  Normally, I was a pretty good A or B student, so I was pretty smart.
Story_ID: 617729
Speaker 1: So thinking in your elementary, getting ready to go on to high school, what did you--what were your dreams or aspirations at that time?  What did you think that you wanted to do with your life at that time?
Speaker 2: I wanted to be a professional ballplayer.  I wanted to a professional baseball, basketball, or football player.
Speaker 1: Who were the teams at that time that you were, were watching?  Who were, who, what teams were playing then or some of the players that were playing baseball and football at that time?
Speaker 2: I, I watched the Brooklyn Dodgers [Los Angeles Dodgers] because that was my father's [A.C. Prince, Sr.] team.  The Brooklyn Dodgers back then was one of the first teams I believe that had a black athlete on the team, with Jackie Robinson.  So I grew up watching the Brooklyn Dodgers in baseball.  And I grew up watching the, the Los Angeles Lakers in, in, in, in, in, in basketball, because they were the dominant forces and, and, and things of that nature.  And I think I was a Cleveland Browns fan in, in football because of the Jim Browns and all, you know, and all of them that went before him.  So, when you start going back to, to my fifth, sixth, fifth and sixth grade years, we used to get out there in the fields and, and start playing ball and, and, and you know, imitate those athletes.  I'd become the, the one of them and shaking and baking and shooting.  And it got to the point to where all of us had nicknames.  They called me Little Quick sometimes because I was pretty shifty on my feet.  But those were, those were years that, coming from, from Enid [Oklahoma] to Carver Elementary School [George Washington Carver Elementary School, Enid, Oklahoma] where we had--and I was in the fourth grade going into the into fifth grade, when I left there we had no formal programs, so to speak.  And then when I moved to Culbertson [Culbertson Elementary School] in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma], we had formal programs.  We had the formal baseball programs and the, and the basketballs programs and the football programs.  And then I had to find a, a, an all new friends because I left all my friends in Enid.  And then I moved to Oklahoma City I met the Walter Ogles [Walter K. Ogles III] and the, and the Michael Gibsons [ph.] and the Michael Strattas [ph.] and James Camels [ph.] and my cousin out there, Sam Holloway [ph.].  And, and, and these are friends that I have right now today, that we played ball together from, from fifth grade and sixth grade all the way through, you know, played baseball and basketball and football.  And the competition was, was so fierce to where since it was a formal program now, we could only have ten players or fifteen players on a team.  But, but the athletes would be so, so, so good that I didn't know how the coaches back then could pick who would play, so they would rotate us, so to speak, so that, so that everybody could play.  But I always wanted to be on the field.  I always wanted to be on the court, so I tried to excel to a level that exceeded above everyone else.  So when I was in the fifth and sixth grade I started in basketball.  And when the coach came to me one day and he says, "We might need to let somebody else play today.  We're playing a weaker team."  I says, "Coach," (cough) excuse me, I says, "coach, I'm out here to play every single day because I want to become a professional athlete, and I don't like to lose.  And coach, just because this team is not as good as the last team we played, on any given day a team could beat you."  And lo and behold, I think I taught my coach something that day, because we were playing for a city championship, and he didn't pull us; he let us play.  He let us play this weaker team, which played us so close that day that if we had not dressed for that game we'd have probably got beaten.  But those are amazing days that, that, that you learn on how to compete, and you compete on a level that, that--I was going to an all-black school, and some of the best athletes in the world, I believe, came through those all-black schools.
Story_ID: 617730
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you, you are now getting ready to go to junior high school.  And we're, we're past the time of Brown v. the Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].  Did you go to an integrated junior high school or high school?
Speaker 2: My junior high school, I went to two, and both of those were, were black schools.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your first junior high school?
Speaker 2: My first junior high school was Moon Junior High School [F.D. Moon Junior High School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma].  It was the only junior high school then for people of color.  It was so huge that we had to have three and four lunch periods.  The, the education level at that school was probably second to none.  We won all of the competitions.  We went four years without losing a basketball, football, or baseball game.  The athletes at, at that Moon Junior High School was, was, went on to become history makers.
Speaker 1: Who were some that came out of that school?
Speaker 2: Amos Thomas, Ray Russell [ph.], Lee Gaines [ph.], Josephus Love [ph.], Oogie Fowler [Nathaniel "Oogie" Fowler], Albert Chandler.  I can just go on and on and on, that some of the, some of the--Ben Hart--some of the greatest athletes that come through Oklahoma City [Oklahoma] that were black went to Moon Junior High School.
Speaker 1: Well, how were their academics?
Speaker 2: Academics there, we won almost every contest amongst all the other schools, the white schools.  I mean our class and, and, and our student body was, was, were some of the sharpest people in the world.  And I'm pretty smart, and, and I wasn't in the fir- stop 10, 15 percent at, at Moon Junior High School.  There were some brilliant people that are now doctors and lawyers and, and, and business entrepreneurs as myself.  The, the, the competition at Moon Junior High School in the '60s [1960s] from an educational athletic level was so competitive that if we had any fights on a campus, it was over competition.
Story_ID: 617731
Speaker 1: And what was the second school that you went to junior high school?
Speaker 2: We opened up a new junior high school on my last year of junior school.  It was Kennedy.  It was still an all-black junior high school, brand new facility they made.  And Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy] came down and, and blessed the school, so to speak, because it was named after his brother [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy], John F. Kennedy Junior High School [Oklahoma City, Oklahoma].  And at that time, they split us up, thinking that it would weaken us.  So they gave--they moved all the people from the north side of 13th Street to, to Kennedy and all the people on the south side of 13th Street to Moon [F.D. Moon Junior High School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma].  And they didn't realize what they had, what they had done.  So if the board of education back then knew what they had done they'd probably left us all at Moon and wouldn't have built a brand new school, because then that made a double dinosaur.  Because Moon sat down there and won everything, and then Kennedy sat over here and won everything.  And the only time we lost is when we played each other; or that one time we lost is when we competed against each other.  So, I guess it defeated the purpose, because they, they, they built this brand new fancy school and says, we'll split, split these folks up, and it would weaken to the point to where we  went across town to, to the Coolidges [Calvin Coolidge Elementary School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma] and the Jacksons [Stonewall Jackson Elementary School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma] and all of those other schools, and the Roosevelts [Roosevelt Junior High School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma] and all those other schools, and Tafts [William Howard Taft Junior High School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], that, that they would be competitive against us from an educational and a, and an athletic level, and it didn't turn out that way.  We had some, some strong educators back there.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the teachers that influenced you during your junior high school years?
Speaker 2: Ms. Pruitt [ph.], Mr. Baker [ph.], Mr. Higgins [ph.], Mr. Haysley [ph.], Mr. Powell [ph.], Mr. Sadbury [ph.], Mr. Burnett [Delbert Burnett], Ms. Scobey [ph.].  I can go on and on, I mean--
Speaker 1: Were you ever taught by any white teachers going through junior high school?
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 617732
Speaker 1: And this is a time the civil rights is--the height of Civil Rights Movement.  What's going on socially?  What's going on in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma]?
Speaker 2: Well, if you were to go downtown there was a, there was a black restroom.  No, excuse me.  There was a colored restroom and a white restroom.  If you go to the, to the counter to eat, there was a colored section that we have to sit, and there was a white section.  You went to the movie, there was a day that the coloreds could go to the movie, and there was a day that the whites could go to the movie, (cough) excuse me.  If you wanted to walk downtown or walk anywhere, there was a section that the whites walked on, and there was a section that the blacks walked on.  If you wanted to drink out of a water fountain, there was a tall water fountain for the whites, and there was a low water fountain for the coloreds that I can remember so vividly.  But it didn't dampen our spirits, because back then we knew that we were equal.  We knew that these were some, some regulations that people had put in place that didn't know any better.  We knew that we were challenging those, those regulations to where the water fountain that was tall and the water fountain was short would all be equal one day, that when we went sit down at the, at the Brown's Deli [ph.] downtown that eventually we would be able to eat and sit at the same counters.  When we went to movies, even though we were watching Westerns and, and cowboys and things of that nature, we could, we could all go to the movie theaters together.  So we, we knew that it, that eventually God had a plan.  And we knew that eventually wise people would, would win out.  But it still hurt, but it didn't dampen our spirits to the point to where we still educated ourselves; we still got jobs that, that we could get; and we still competed against one another to, to better ourselves from an education or an athletic viewpoint.
Speaker 1: Were there any demonstrations going on in, in your town?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  I mean we had civil rights movements.  We had people coming in from nationals that would come in and, and, and, and demonstrate.  My mother [Daisy Reels Prince] and father [A.C. Prince, Sr.] would demonstrate.  They would take us down to, to get the water hose sprayed on us (cough) or get trash thrown on us or get manure thrown on us.  But it was a way of life back then.  It was, it was a way of life that we know that if we didn't continue to chip, chip, chip, chip away at that door, that we it would never happen, and we would still be dormant; we would still be treated like second class citizens.  You know, today is so much different from what it was back then.  I remember the times that, that I got served a drink, and I paid that four or five cents or whatever it was back then for a drink.  The, the guy handed it to me with no bottom in it.  So that means when I got the drink it was leaking.  But that was the way we were treated.  If I raised hell and decided that I wanted to do something about this, that I paid for this drink with a hole in the bottom, and it's leaking out before I can drink it, that's when you hear the sirens, and that's when you start getting treated differently.  But I was steadfast and taught by, by my parents and grandparents [Lillian Prince, Grant Prince, and Sherman Prince] that, that there's always a common side to everything you do.  So, so I paid for the drink and drunk what I could get and, and left.
Story_ID: 617733
Speaker 1: You go on to high school, and tell me the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: I went to, I went to Douglass High School [Frederick A. Douglass High School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], which was an all-black school for about three or four months, and then that's when they came up with the integration plan and the busing plan.
Speaker 1: Now this is in 1964, so this is ten years after the Brown v. the Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954]--
Speaker 2: That's, that's correct (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) before they decide that they're gonna inter- integrate the schools.
Speaker 2: In, in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma] there was still and all-black school, which was Douglass High School.  Douglass High School was, was the premier school for, for Negroes or blacks or African Americans in, in Oklahoma City.  So when I, when I graduated from Kennedy Junior High School [John F. Kennedy Junior High School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], Douglass High School was within three blocks from where I went to junior high school.  So I enrolled in Douglass High School and was able to stay there for about three or four months.  And then they came in and said, "Well, your parents [Daisy Reels Prince and A.C. Prince, Sr.] live on this side of 23rd Street, so that means now you have to go to the, to the integrated school," which was Northeast High School [Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], which was probably one of the saddest days of my life but then probably one of the most rewarding days of my life too, because then they took me out of Douglass High School, which was the all-black school, colored school back then, and moved me to, to Northeast High School.  And Northeast High School was, was then an integrated school.  Douglass High School was still an all-black school.  But Northeast High School was the first move that they, that they did at the, at the integration level of moving people out of Douglass to Northeast.  And I, I lived on the other side of 23rd Street, so that mean- meant that I had to go to, to Northeast High School.  And, and the moved me to Northeast, an integrated school.
Speaker 1: So tell me about the differences in the school.
Speaker 2: Well, all of my friends was at Douglass, with the exception of a few.  I couldn't see any difference in the curriculum.  I couldn't see any difference in the, in, in the way I was being taught from the, from the all-colored, all-black school to the, to the, to the integrated school.  I really didn't understand what the big fuss was.  But, but I accepted it because that was what we had to do.  I learned at, at Douglass the three or four months I was there, and I excelled at, at Northeast on an educational level as well as an athletic level, and graduated there probably in the top, (cough) excuse me, top 10 percent of my class. Played on three--well, yeah, three straight state champion teams and, basketball teams.  And, and we were the only team that, that beat Douglass in 1967, when they had such a, a great run until they got to the state tournament and got cheated.
Story_ID: 617734
Speaker 1: What about the teachers?  Is this the first--are you being taught by white teachers now [at Northeast High School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]?
Speaker 2: Had a white principal, Leon Bruner.  We had a black assistant principal, which was Dr. Melvin Todd, Mr. Melvin Todd then.  I was taught in some classes by, by white men and women, and the first time I've ever experienced that in my life, of having a white teacher.
Speaker 1: What was that experience like?
Speaker 2: It was a little traumatic, because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell me why?
Speaker 2: --I had problems communicating with them at first, because I never had a, a, a, a, a white teacher.  So then, in essence, it took my basketball coach, which was a white coach, to sit me down one day and says, "Here."  He tucked something and stuck a pin in his hand, and he squeezed the pin, all right.  Then he came over to me and he stuck a pin in my hand, and he squeezed the pin.  And he says, "Do you see any difference in that blood?"  And I says, "No."  He said, "So it's no difference between me as a white coach or me as a white teacher as it is those black coaches and black teachers that have taught you for all those years."  He says, "I have a no prejudice bone in my body.  I want you to understand that, and 80 to 90 percent of these teachers in this school chose to come over here because they wanted to work in this environment.  So with you being a star basketball player or a star athlete, you need to lead by an example to some of your other peers around you so that everybody can get on board that we're here to do a job; you're here to learn; and I'm here to win some state championships."  So my basketball coach, which was Jerry Anderson, taught me then how to accept not only being coached by a white man, but also being taught by a white man and white lady.  And after that experience, everything was just fine, because the curriculum, the education, the teaching on and off of a basketball or football or basketball field was basically the same.

Speaker 1: Were your desires still wanting to a professional athlete at that time?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  I mean, I knew that I hit my books and done my job like I was supposed to.  Then I'd taken a strong passion for, for basketball and, and, and baseball, kind of put the football a little bit the side, but even though I, I competed.  But as basketball was my, was my first love and then baseball, even though my father [A.C. Prince, Sr.] wanted baseball to be my first love. But I, I excelled in basketball to the point to where I was one of the, the tops in, in, in the school [Northeast High School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma].  I was captain of my basketball team my senior year.  I, I had a pretty good game for, for a point guard.  But I also learned the books, because I know I couldn't be accepted in any college or any institution without knowing the books.  So, but I also knew that I was so poor that I had to work.  So I, I dwelled with all of that around, going to basketball practice, going to baseball practice, going to work, trying to make a living, and getting my grades.  That's a, those, those were full time jobs and then trying to work the girls in there in between.
Speaker 1: What type of work did you do while you were in high school?
Speaker 2: Cut grass, washed dishes, waited on tables, worked in a service station, worked in a sporting goods store.  I, I did anything I could to survive.
Story_ID: 617736
Speaker 1: Did you go to your high school prom [at Northeast High School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was it an integrated prom?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Who did you take to the prom?
Speaker 2: My junior year my mother [Daisy Reels Prince] made me take a, a girl from Guthrie [Oklahoma] that she tried to get me to marry.  That didn't, that didn't pan out because we were two different types of people.  My senior year I took a, a beautiful young lady from, from Langston [Oklahoma] that was in my church.  I met her through my church, was dating her for quite some time.  And then my, my freshman year in college [Central State College; University of Central Oklahoma, Edmond, Oklahoma], I took my, my soon-to-be wife, which was a year behind me to her senior prom.  So I guess I experienced the prom scene three years, junior, sophomore [sic. senior], and freshman in college.
Story_ID: 617737
Speaker 1: Who helped you decide or to apply for, for colleges?  And, and did you get a scholarship?
Speaker 2: When I graduated from, from, from high school, I was offered multiple scholarships to, to play basketball.  I was also offered some educational scholarships to, to attend school.  I was also madly in, I thought, I love with, with, with my soon-to-be wife to the point to where I wanted to, to accept all manly responsibilities.  So I decided to, to go to school and commute, and, and, and work, and then go back to Northeast [Northeast High School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma] to see my girlfriend as often as possible.
Speaker 1: So what school did you decide to attend?
Speaker 2: I, I attended the, first the Central State College [University of Central Oklahoma] in, in Edmond, Oklahoma.  And then I, I went to the University of Oklahoma [Norman, Oklahoma].
Speaker 1: And what was your course of study?
Speaker 2: I studied the business administration.  When I started out, at first I was studying elementary education.  I said hey, I wanted to be a teacher because I felt like that was the top professional job, and they made all this money.  And they had these great hours, and they were off three, three months in the, in the summer.  But then when I started looking at the pay scale on what the, what the teachers made, I very, very quickly changed my curriculum to, to business administration, and I'm glad I did.
Speaker 1: So when did you get married?
Speaker 2: I got married in 1969.
Speaker 1: So it was a year after you graduated from high school?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And it was the year she graduated.  Is that right?
Speaker 2: It's the year she graduated.  We got married the summer she graduated.  She graduated May, and we got married in August.
Speaker 1: And tell me more about your time at Oklahoma State and the classes that you were taking in preparing you for, for business.
Speaker 2: Didn't go to Oklahoma State.  That's Central State and Oklahoma University.
Speaker 1: Oklahoma University.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: I, I studied everything that I could to, to get ahead.  Matter of fact, when I started the school I didn't stop.  I, I went straight through because I wanted to hurry up and get that education.  I wanted to hurry up and get a decent job because I was a, a married student then that, that had a wife that I didn't want to work because I was used to the fact that my mother [Daisy Reels Prince] didn't work; my [maternal] grandmother [Lillian Prince] didn't work, so I didn't want my, my wife to work.  Maybe that was a mistake (laughter).  I don't know.  But, but I worked two and three jobs from a service station to, to cutting grass to whatever I needed to do to survive and, and get my books.  So the reward from going to school and working, I'd say was tantamount because it taught me how to become a bread earner, with the fact that I, I disciplined enough to go to school and disciplined enough to, to maintain full-time employment because that's the way I watched my father [A.C. Prince, Sr.]; he maintained two and three jobs.  So, I, I, I, I, I wouldn't change that for nothing in the world.
Story_ID: 617738
Speaker 1: So you graduated [from University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma] with what degree?  Was it in 1972?
Speaker 2: I graduated in 1971 with a B.A. degree.  I went back to school and got another degree in legal studies in 2000--well, 1994 or so.  But then I, I got the, the, the limited education, and people said, "Go on and get a master's [degree] or a doctor's" or whatever, but I didn't see that as prevalent for what I was wanting to do.  Right then I had known that I wasn't gonna become a professional athlete, so I needed to be a worker or a businessman.  So at first I chose a worker bee and got me some jobs, and I didn't like that.  So then I said well, I'd better be a businessman.  And I kind of took those talents and, and I guess the rest is history.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me what happens after you decided you want to be a businessman?  What business was it that you wanted to pursue?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't have any money.  So basically what I did is I, I was working in the service station in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma] and going to school and married.  Then the owner of the service station came to me and says, "I'm tired of driving over here on this side of town, so I'm gonna let the service station go.  So I'm giving you a notice that you need to go find you another job."  So at that time one of the owners and founders, (cough) excuse me, of TG&Y, which was one of my customers at that time, Mr. T.A. Killian.  I was crying one day and was--he came up and he says, "What's wrong?" Called me Sonny.  And I says, "Gary [ph.] just told me that I gotta go get me another job because he was letting the service station go."  And at that time I think I was about eighteen, or maybe not, about nineteen.  And he says, "Do you want to stay here?"  And I says, "Yes."  He says, "Well, then I'm gonna buy the service station for you."  My eyes lit up, and I thought he was kidding with me.  But no, he wasn't.  He went to Kerr McGee [Kerr McGee Oil Industries, Inc.] at that time and told Mr. McGee [Dean A. McGee], he told Mr. McGee that he was gonna buy that service station for me and stand by it to make sure that it was ran right.  So he bought the station, turned it over to me, and I ran it and paid him back.  And matter of fact, I paid him back quicker than, than I was supposed to.  And I had that service station for many, many, many years.  It paid my way through, through college and took care of my family.  And, and it was a full service station, so we washed cars, and fixed flats, and put on tire chains in the snow, and, and washed the windshields, and changed the oil, and, and, and, and fixed the flats, whatever it took to, to keep a vehicle running.  That was the way I ran my service station.  So that was my first taste of entrepreneur.  And back then I was nineteen, twenty years old making thirty-five and forty thousand dollars a year.  So I thought I was big stuff.  And I was able to take care of my wife.  And she drove these Cadillacs and went to Catholic church, and she didn't work.  And we lived in one of the finest (cough)--one of the finest homes up in Edmond [Oklahoma], and I thought I was on top of, of God's earth, sure did.
Speaker 1: So how many years--now what year did he purchase the filling station for you?
Speaker 2: I was nineteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it had to be 1969 (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sixty-nine [1969].  And you kept it for how long?
Speaker 2: I kept it until, oh, I, I guess I kept it eleven, twelve years.
Story_ID: 617739
Speaker 1: So what happens next?
Speaker 2: What happens next is I kind of bounce around from, from entrepreneur to restaurants to, to nightclubs ownership to, to--
Speaker 1: You were buying different businesses?
Speaker 2: Yes, from real estate to, to all these different businesses that--liquor stores.  I mean I was, I was trying to find a niche.  I wanted to find a niche, being able to, to take care of my family but as well as find a niche in a business that I wanted to be able to stick my teeth in and just make my career out of it.  And I just bounced from, from owning businesses to businesses to businesses, from real estate to nightclubs to restaurants to (cough), to liquor stores.  I just did whatever my money would, would allude me to do to try to, try to make a living.
Speaker 1: And were you ever in the wireless communication business?
Speaker 2: My, my passion of, of, of being an entrepreneur had some people attract to me because they said this guy's got strong work ethics and, and, and strong drive.  So I was approached by, by various white men as well as some black men many, many years ago.  And, and they says, "We're getting ready to, to try to bring cell phones to the United States.  We need somebody to, to help us bring these cell phones to the United States.  The technology is learned in, in Europe and overseas, and we need somebody to go over there and, and study the technology and understand the technology and, and assist us with, with, with making a presentation to the, to the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] that would allow us to bring mobile phones, so to speak, to the United States."  So I was offered that, that challenge.  They told me they would pay me so much money to go over there and figure out this.  And I was recently divorced, so I said okay, I'm gone.  So I left and went to, went to Europe and all over Europe and became a vagabond, just learning how they built out cell phone networks and learning what the technology was and the differences and all of that.  And I stayed over there for a while, to the point to where I became a guru.  I think I knew as much about building a cell phone network as probably anybody back then.
Story_ID: 617740
Speaker 1: So tell me the years that it took for you to--how long were you in Europe, and what year did you come back?
Speaker 2: I went to Europe in 1979, and I came back to the United States in 19--latter part of 1980.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And tell me what happens next?  What did you do with the information?  You said you were now the gruru- guru.  Tell me what you did with the information that you obtained?
Speaker 2: I met with a large conglomerate of, of, of white professionals that wanted to get into the cell phone business, that, that had paid my expenses on sending me over there.
Speaker 1: Was this a, a, a group, a specific group of people?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was specific group.  The owners of Cellular One [Cellular One, LLC] back then.  So what we did is, is I gave them all of my reports and, and showed them exactly some of the bits and missing pieces that they didn't have on, on tuning up a network, R, RF [radio frequency] promul- promulgation plans on, on how you had to have the cell sites to talk to each other, and how you would control the billing and, and things of that nature, and how you would do the maintenance on the, on the, on the phones.  So I went through everything that I had learned while I was over there working as a worker bee so that I could learn how the people in Europe were able to, to build networks, that would transmit a signal that would allow them to invoice the customer and make money from a commercial standpoint.
Story_ID: 617741
Speaker 1: So, once we put all of this information together, then they made--I didn't participate in a, in the presentation.  But they, they made the presentation to the (cough)--to the FT- FCC [Federal Communications Commission] so that they could petition to do some trial, trial network bills to the--can show the FCC that it wouldn't be harmful to, to the residents.  And it would be an added feature, or an added benefit to be able to have cell on wheels or mobile phone on wheels.  So once we got that presentation together and was able to convince the FCC that it's something worth trying, then we did--went to Chicago [Illinois].  I think this was like 1981 or '82 [1982]--'81 [1981].  And we built several cell sites in the black community on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], because if it was anything damaging, then I heard in the--you know, they forgot that I was, I was there.  I was just one of them then.  But they says, "Well, if we're gonna fry somebody, we might as well fry them niggers over on the South Side."  And I'll never forget that.  So we, we went over there, and we did the test on the South Side to, to make sure that it wasn't damaging the, the radio frequency, the frequenc- wasn't damaging anyone to the point there were--we were, we were building out these networks, and, and, and doing those, doing those various things that we, that we had to, had to do, and putting towers on, on rooftops, and putting towers in the communities, and, and making sure they were talking to each other.  And lo and behold, we were able to make a call.  So we were able to, to talk to each other on a, on, on, on a cell phone.  It wasn't like a, a telegraph.  I mean we were able to talk to each other.  And I'll never forget that day because we all screamed and hollered and says, "Yes, we have done it!"  And we built about thirty or forty sites on the South Side of Chicago and was able to, able to make a call.  And they even went back to the FCC--think this was like '82 [1982]--and told the FCC that we wanted to, to build a commercial network.  So they had an auction and gave them the license.  And they came to me and says, "Okay, want you to take everything you learned now, and, and, and build out a commercial network in Chicago, Illinois."  So, we build out a commercial network in, in Chicago, Illinois, and we test it.  And the FCC inspected it and tested it and made sure that we were doing the billing right, we were not cheating anybody, we were able to capture the minutes used, and it wasn't damaging to anyone's health and things of that nature.
Story_ID: 617742
Speaker 1: So that was a success.  And then we went to Indianapolis, Indiana, and we did another build out in Indianapolis, Indiana.  This is all through Cellular One [Cellular One, LLC].  So we built--no, it was through Ameritech Cellular [Ameritech Mobile Communications, LLC].  So we built out a, another commercial network in Indianapolis.  It was a little bit bigger than the one we did in Chicago [Illinois], and, and it became a success.  And then we came to Dallas, Texas and built out another network, which was a little bit bigger, and it became a success.  And overnight, overnight, after we did those three test markets, the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] was having these auctions.  And people was putting up these millions and millions of dollars.  And people were buying spectrums and, and doing this.  They went from the AT&Ts [AT&T Inc.], the BellSouths [BellSouth Corporation], the Southwestern Bells [Southwestern Bell Telephone Company; SBC Communications Inc.], the Ameritech Cellulars, the, the, the Cellular Ones, you know, all these people was then getting with Oki [Oki Electric Industry Company, Ltd.], which was O-K-I, which was the first handset that we used back then, and then we went to the Motorolas [Motorola, Inc.].  And, and now Nokia's [Nokia Corporation] the big daddy of the handsets.  But we went to all of these suppliers that were able to give us some backbones and some supports.  And they went over to Europe and copied things and did this here.  And then we built a, the very first commercial networks, and we--the phones was on a pedestal to where it would honk the horn, and then you knew it was ringing when you wasn't in the car.  So it would honk your horn.  And we were selling these phones for thirty-five hundred dollars apiece, and people were buying them.  So we said wow, we hit something here, because people were paying this money for these phones.  And, and cell phone bills were two and three hundred dollars back in the '80s [1980s].  So I said to myself, I says, "Wow, this is the industry that I want to be in."  And all this research now is paying out, that I was a project manager for the very first wireless commercial network in this country, a, a black man; you know, I said, "Wow."  So then, then we, we, we go back and, and look over some things and, and then lo and behold, spectrums is popping up, and people are doing millions and millions of dollars.  And I'm getting calls from people all over the United States to come help them build out networks, from the Western Wirelesses [Western Wireless Corporation], the, the, the AT&Ts.  I mean they were just, they were just coming out of everywhere.  So, I decided to come back off the road and come into Oklahoma City [Oklahoma].  And then I went to work at, at the Western Wireless at Oklahoma City.  We were building out a network there.  It was in the, in the, in, in, in the '80s [1980s] and, and, and early part of '90s [1990s].  And, and, and then the rest is history.  I just went from place to place to place and building out cell phone networks.
Speaker 2: All for west, for Western Wireless (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh no.  I was working, I was working for everybody then.  I was a, I was kind of like a hired gun. When they wanted to build out a network they'd come get me and some more people, and we'd go and negotiate the leases, assist with the RF [radio frequency] design, set up the networks, do the equipment purchases, start laying out the, the, the spectrums, and, and start building these networks.  And I never envisioned the cell phone business to be as big as it is today.  We went from thirty-five hundred dollar units, and now you can get a cell phone free.  We went from two, two hundred dollar a minute packages to now you can get a twenty-nine dollar a minute package.  We went from, from fifty thousand subscribers to now maybe five--now, now maybe 4 or 5 billion subscribers.  It's one of the largest industries in the United States.  And, and I'm glad to be on the cutting edge of it.  I'm, I'm considered probably now one of the leading authorities in, in the wireless telecommunications.  And I still have to, have to study every single day to, to keep up with all the changes.  Now we got emails, and we got faxes on the phone, and, and we got photos on the phones.  And you know, now you can, you--it's so many different gadgets and widgets now that we got with the, with the cell phone to where I don't think we'll ever be able to do without a cell phone.  It's just a landline phone.  Most people now have cell phones and don't have landline phones.  So that's how I got started in, in, in the wireless telecommunication business, and it's been, been very rewarding.
Story_ID: 617743
Speaker 1: When did you develop Prince and Associates [Dallas, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Opened Prince and Associates in 1986.  I decided that I wanted to open my own consulting firm.  I wanted to be able to get paid the, an hourly rate or a monthly wake or a daily rate.  I also started doing a little legal business because I had got the, some legal certifications, and so we're doing this little paralegal business.  And, and Prince and Associates on the, on the, on the wireless side.  And then we were doing a little bit of real estate acquisitions and, and development.  So, my first three business segments at Prince and Associates was, was wireless telecommunications, a little bit of paralegal work, and, and, and real estate, tried dabbling with that a little bit.  I, I says I never envisioned that, that, that, that, that wireless communications would last that long.  I felt like somebody would take controls of it, and they would start tying it in with the wire line phone and making it something unique.  So I says I can't put all of my eggs in one basket, so I dabbled with the real estate, dabbled with the little legal business.  But I kept going back to my first love, which was the, the telecommunications.  And then we just started negotiating agreements and doing deals, and people were buying spectrum and billions and millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars was being spent.  I mean it was like, I mean people were spending hundreds and two hundred thousand dollars for, for leases and, and equipment.  And, and I'm, I'm making, I'm making $250 an hour to be a consultant back in the '80s [1980s].  And I says, "Wow, this is more than I ever envisioned."  And believe me when I say that the wireless communication business hasn't even touched the surface yet.  There's still some more gadgets and widgets that we're gonna do.
Story_ID: 617744
Speaker 1: So in 19--(clears throat) nine--that, that was 1986 that you developed Prince and Associates [Dallas, Texas] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Prince and Associates, yeah.
Speaker 1: And 1991 you expanded your services, providing independent toma- telecommunication consulting services, right?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And this is not only in the United States.  Do you branch out internationally as well?
Speaker 2: I built out several foreign markets over the course of multiple years, Poland, Czechoslovakia [Czech Republic and Slovakia], UK [United Kingdom]. I, I went over there and, and, and built out those networks.  They invited me.  They wanted me.  They came after me and they says, "As rapidly as you all are building out these networks in the United States, we want you to come over and work with us."  So, I, I went overseas and, and built out multiple networks across Europe and, and things of that nature. That which was a rewarding experience of the fact that they had to give me a driver because of those turnabouts over there.  The first time I was over there driving, somebody run over me 'cause I didn't understand how those turnabouts worked.  So they gave me a driver to take me everywhere I needed to go.  First, the first trip I remember to Europe they gave me a Mercedes [Mercedes-Benz] to drive, and I was going around these turnabouts, and I just run over somebody or somebody run me because I didn't know which way to, to, to, to maneuver.  So I says I can't do this here, so they gave me a driver, and that driver stayed with me over there for about eighteen months and taking me.  And they gave me a villa to live in.  And everywhere I went they gave me villa, and they gave me a driver, to the point to where it taught me how to, to appreciate things.  But it also showed me that these people had a genuine interest in building out wireless communications, because wireless communications now has became and has become your office away from home.
Story_ID: 617745
Speaker 1: So what happens next in the business?  You, you continue to run your business [Prince and Associates, Dallas, Texas].  You're consulting, and I need to understand, what is a monopole agreement?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to Florida, and we were doing some build out works for, for a carrier down there.  And in Florida there's a big turnpike that takes you from one end of the state to the other end of the state.  So the coverage was so stagnatic [stagnated] because they had the swamps and then and the Everglades and all of that.  So the most righteous land in Florida was on the turnpike.  So, they tapped me to go down and make a ne- and negotiate with the Florida Department of Transportation, turnpike division, to negotiate a deal with them that will allow us to put monopoles.  Monopole is, is a free standing pole that you got antennas on it that, that's not so obtrusive, instead of having a, a, a self-support pole, which has three legs on it or a guide tower that has wires stringing from here to here.  So they says, want to negotiate a monopole agreement because we know they won't allow us to put these obstructive poles on turnpike properties.  So I went to Tallahassee [Florida] for about six or seven months frequently, negotiating a, a monopole agreement with Jesse Chandlis [ph.], more people at Florida Department of Transportation, turnpike division.  First they didn't want no parts of it because it's not what they wanted to do.  Then I was able to show them the revenue stream that they could generate, that they can get more money off these, off these ground and letting us put monopoles on it than get on tolls running through the, through the toll gate.  So we finally convinced them to allow us to do a monopole agreement.  So this monopole agreement that I became a project manager and, and, and working with the Florida Department of Transportation Turnpike District [Florida Department of Transportation Turnpike Enterprise] was probably one of the very first monopole agreements that was made in this country in regards to, to the turnpike districts and the department of transportation agreeing to allow an independent carrier, an independent source to be able to put structures on their right aways.  So after we (cough)--so, excuse me--after we were able to negotiate that agreement with the monopoles and all of that in regards to, to now filling holes and gaps in the networks, but the agreement was that we would have all the carriers with collocate, we call collocate on those monopoles.  So the Sprints [Sprint Corporation], and, and, and the AT&Ts [AT&T Inc.], and the Verizons [Verizon Communications, Inc.], and the, and, and the, and the T-Mobiles [T-Mobile US, Inc.], or VoiceStreams [VoiceStream Wireless Corporation] back in those days, would all have to agree to, to collate on these towers.  And that was a no brainer, (cough) excuse me, because, because these were the best locations.  I was able to, to negotiate the best location, build up four and three and four, and in some cases five carrier monopole which was not obstructive.  Some think that the monopoles look like a light pole, so it blended it good with the, with the aesthetics of the, of, of the, of the turnpike.  A lot of cases you wouldn't even know they were there.  And this was the largest independent monopole agreement negotiated in the United States.  I headed that program up for about a year and half or two in Florida building these monopoles.  And, and a lot of those people that were working with me on those monopole agreements still work with me today as my employees.  And the, the, the, the lightning rod was when the very first agreement came in, and we had all four carriers on this one monopole.  And we were charging them something like four to five thousand dollars a month for them to be able to collate on this monopole.  So the department of transportation came back and said, "Wow, this is a, this is a, this is a heck of a deal.  This is a revenue generator. Because you got four people on this tower that's sitting in a small footprint of ours, and they're paying us four or five thousand dollars a month.  And we get escalations on this here every year.  And they're signing thirty and forty year agreements to where this is, this is revenue generating just off of our land.  And then they have to maintain this, this hundred by hundred or two hundred by a hundred compound, with a, with a, with a tower sitting in the middle of it, with the equipment that generates the signal and captures the money in there.  And then they made us put these fences around them with the, with the green slates in it so you couldn't see the, the, the equipment."  So basically, all you saw was a, was a, was a pole going up with antennas on it that blended in with the lights.  So I sold that deal, and I believe that that was probably the most prolific deal on, in my career, because now I believe that every major department of transportation across the United States are allowing the carriers now to go into their right aways and build these towers and generate revenue off of these towers, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What type of budget did you have to work with, with it?
Speaker 2: The, the first year it was probably 1.7 million, and it grew to probably, it grew to probably 35, 40 million, so it was a pretty, pretty good sized budget.
Speaker 1: And this was in 1997?
Speaker 2: Yeah, about '97 [1997].
Story_ID: 617746
Speaker 1: So what's your next, what was the next project--
Speaker 2: Oh, next (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that you went into?
Speaker 2: --the next projects, I built out networks for Sprint [Sprint Corporation].  I built out networks for--
Speaker 1: Nextel [Nextel Communications, Inc.], was that--
Speaker 2: --for Nextel.  They invited me--they had this big conference in, in, in New Orleans [Louisiana].  So they came to me and says, "It's hard for us to have a, a telecommunications conference in New Orleans when people can't talk on their cell phones."  So they had a bad experience a year before that where people coming into the cities for this conference and people were complaining because here is a wireless conference, and we can't talk on our telephones, so it was called CTIA.  So they came to me and says, "We want you to come in and build us an infrastructure.  We want you to build us a temporary infrastructure that where we can capture all the people that come into the city and provide them with a service.  And then once the conference is over, we want you to take the infrastructure out and not damage anything."  So they said they wanted me to take it from the airport [New Orleans International Airport; Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, New Orleans, Louisiana] to the convention center in New Orleans.  So I says, "Okay."  And they says that the GM services providers, which is--or the GSM [Global System for Mobile Communications] services providers would pay me to be able to, to do this. (Cough) And, and GSM is the technology that we used in Europe.  So, I went down and then I started de- designing a frequency.  And I sat with some of the Nextel R engineers, and we did some things like that.  So then we developed--Nextel was on, on the IGN technology [IBM Global Network], and then the GSM carriers, which was the, the AT&Ts [AT&T Inc.] and, and, and VoiceStreams [VoiceStream Wireless Corporation] back then--I believe it was VoiceStream, T-Mobile [T-Mobile US, Inc.], whatever they were called.  So the VoiceStreams back then and they hired us to, to, to, to have the IGN technology and the GSM technology all work in the convention center, and the airports, and all the corridors leading from the airports, and around the French Quarter [New Orleans, Louisiana], and the hotels.  So I tasked my team.  Then we went down and we sat up an infrastructure, an RF [radio frequency] plan, a technology plan, and then we started putting up what they call COWs, which is cells on wheels.  So we started putting up temporary structures in strategic locations and things like that.  And then we also put maybe a few permanent structures that we couldn't put the, the cells on wheels.  And we attached to some permanent structures where we got a solid network.  And they had the CTIA convention.  And we were able to generate hundreds and hundreds and hundreds or, or thousands of minutes for these carriers to where the conference was so successful, so successful in, in New Orleans that where every year when the conferences are not held in, in, in major locations, that there are temporary infrastructure built to be able to handle traffic, whether it be in Super Bowl or Final Four [NCAA Final Four] or, or say they're conferences, or, or, or major conferences across the United States, or major sporting events across the United States where there are an influx of additional people that would bog down the networks.  Because you don't have that much traffic on networks on a normal basis, but when you bring this influx of people, you got to be able to handle the traffic.  So now, we've got this down to a science now that where you can go in and build a temporary infrastructure, handle all of the traffic across the, the spectrum, and then once this, these people go back to their home base, we take the structures out.
Speaker 1: Was this the first time that this was done?
Speaker 2: First time ever.
Speaker 1: And om- omupo- Omnipoint Communications [Omnipoint Communications, Inc.], is that who headed up the effort?
Speaker 2: Amnipoin- Omnipoint headed up the effort, and they hired me on the GSM side.  And then on the, on the IGN side, Nextel is the one that hired us.
Speaker 1: So this was in 2000.
Speaker 2: In 2000.
Speaker 1: And so now it's being done every--
Speaker 2: It's--
Speaker 1: --in every major city.
Speaker 2: Every major city.
Story_ID: 617747
Speaker 1: You got to remember now, you build a network to handle, like for instance, if we in, if we in New Orleans, Louisiana, that's five hundred thousand people there.  But when you bring another hundred thousand people into the city, that network that you built cannot handle that traffic.  Or, for instance, if you're in, in, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, or if you're in Tampa Bay, Florida, which we had to do a Super Bowl deal in Tampa, Tampa Bay, Florida to where in Tampa Bay they got so many people on that network every day, so it wasn't conducive for them to add any additional structure because it can handle that network.  But when you bring the Super Bowl to Tampa Bay, and you bring in another hundred, two hundred, three hundred thousand people, and all those people got to be able to talk on that network, so it, it would bog a network down if we didn't go in and build that infrastructure.  So we went in and built the infrastructure in Tampa Bay for the Super Bowl [Super Bowl XXXV] and brought in additional cell towers and all that.  And then once the weekly activities for the Super Bowl was over, then we take it out.  But it generated so much revenue, and, and, and it pleased the, the, the, the attendees, and, and the, and the professionals, and the executives that needed their cell phones to be able to conduct business while they're in Tampa Bay for a whole year, to the point to where now it's a commonality.  Then when, when we know that we gonna have these events, then we're gonna go in and set the infrastructure up to be able to, to, to meet the demand and the traffic and be able to make the carriers that are providing this service and additional money, and they don't lose any revenue.  And they don't have any mad customers because they can't communicate back home or to their offices or vice versa while they're on this assignment or the Super Bowl or while they're doing this or doing that.  So, so, so basically, that, from 2000 on, has been a niche that my company [Prince and Associates, Dallas, Texas] has provided and, and still provide, to where we're one of the few that can go in and do this real, real quick, get it down professionally, and get it taken out.
Speaker 2: How long does it take to build this in- infrastructure?
Speaker 1: Take about two weeks, two or three weeks.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And, and you're one of the few.  Who, who are some of your competition?
Speaker 1: Oh, I've got competition in, in BankTEL [BankTEL Systems, LLC] or General Dynamics [General Dynamics Corporation] or WFI [Wireless Facilities, Inc.; LCC Deployment Services, Inc.].  They have multiple companies now that, that have people that used to work for me that they've stolen, and they teach them how to do it, or, or (cough) they got a, they got enough intelligence to the point to now that where they can get out and, and do it themselves.  It's not rocket science.  It's just that I was the first one challenged to do it.  And, and, and, and we did it.
Story_ID: 617748
Speaker 1: You execute a agreement with Eckersenson?
Speaker 2: With Ericsson [Ericsson A.B.]?
Speaker 1: Ericsson.  Is that--sorry, Ericsson.  Tell me what that agreement was about, Ericsson.
Speaker 2: Ericsson came to Florida because it wanted to get into the wireless telecommunication businesses from a service provider.  So they came down and, and talked to me because they considered me one of the, the leading authorities on this here and to, to work with them on showing them how to take this from point A to point Z.  So then Ericsson signed me as a, as an in house consultant for a couple of years to be able to come in and assist them in setting up their, their wireless telecommunications division.  A gentleman by the name of, of, of Gardner Charbury [ph.], he, he had a vision that, that he wanted to see Ericsson go into this, this wireless space from a services point, because they were already serving the, selling the equipment.  So, the, the--of team of myself, Dan Pashay [ph.], Nick Anderson, Martin John Derricks [ph.], Renee Kemp [ph.], we worked tirelessly within Ericsson with, with Doug Walker and Don Mason [ph.] and, and some others, George Thomas [ph.] and some more.  We worked tirelessly inside of Ericsson to, to teach them how to provide services on the wireless network and make a profit, set up their infrastructure.  And, and now that they were selling the equipment, it made them a double sword to their competition, because then they could provide the services.  So, this was probably one of the most challenging experiences that I also had to have, was going to a equipment company and showing them how to do services that were not within their parameters as- parameters of a business.  So we created a completely new network services division to provide services on building cell towers and site acquisition and things of that nature.
Story_ID: 617749
Speaker 1: So now we're, we're into 2005, and you designed operations for midwestern cities.  Can you tell me about that?
Speaker 2: Well, we were, we were asked by several carriers to help them build out their networks in the Midwest.  I had had some prior contacts with U.S. Cellular [United States Cellular Corporation] through, through the days when Ameritech Cellular [Ameritech Mobile Communications, LLC] owned some phases of that.  And some of the management team came from Ameritech Cellular, so we were able to do some project management construction management work for, for U.S. Cellular, (cough) excuse me, both independent and, and, and through Ericsson [Ericsson A.B.] in several markets across the midwestern part of the United States.  I think those networks are, are the dominant networks now based upon some of the work that we did.
Story_ID: 617750
Speaker 1: And tell me, what was the next project with Cingular Wireless [Cingular Wireless LLC], which is now AT&T [AT&T Mobility LLC]?
Speaker 2: Well, we, we, I think in 2005, we accepted a major contract to do some, some work for Cingular Wireless on the western region through Lucent [Lucent Technologies, Inc.].  We were able to, to build out Salt Lake City [Utah] and some of the areas across the, the western parameters of the United States for Cingular Wireless.  Cingular Wireless now, which is now AT&T, is probably one of our, our largest customers today, whether we're working as a prime contractor or whether we're working as a, as a tier two contractor.  We probably touch more AT&T sites than, than anybody in the United States, may, maybe with the exception of BankTEL [BankTEL Systems, LLC].  BankTEL's done quite a bit also.  But we, we touched quite a few sites for, for BankTEL as well as working directly for, for AT&T.
Speaker 1: I, I see the, the term, full turnkey construction.  What does that mean?
Speaker 2: That means you take it from cradle to grave.  That means that you assist with the RF [radio frequency] planning; you do the site acquisition; you do the surveying; you do the environmental; you do the geotechnicals; you could do phase ones; you do the NIPAs [national income and product accounts]; you do, (cough) excuse me, you do the structural engineering; you do all the integrity checks; you do the construction; you do the installation; and you do the turn on.  So basically, you take it from cradle to grave.  So that means the customer will give you a, a task that they need so many cell sites commissioned by a certain date, and it's your responsibility to take it from beginning to end.  So you're the Alpha and Omega.
Story_ID: 617751
Speaker 1: Now tell me about the part of your business that you contracted with Extended Stay hotels [Extended Stay America, Inc.].
Speaker 2: This is something I diversified out to--had a good friend of mine that went to work for Extended Stay, Davie Calimet [ph.].  I had some prior relationships with him in telecommunications space.  And he was having problems with people doing the renovations of his hotels.  So he told me, he said, "Clovis [HistoryMaker Clovis Prince], I can--you can probably make about $3 million for doing the hotel renovation."  So I said, "Okay."  He says, "And this means that you can do paint, carpet, tile, EF and I [engineer, furnish and install]."  I said, "Okay."  "But you have to do a floor a week."  So I says, "Okay that means a floor a week, and you get paid $3 million to do a floor a week."  So I said, "Okay, a three story Extended Stay."  So, we tackled that challenge in which we didn't know that much about it, but we learned it and got it perfected to the point to where I had to fire a couple of contractors, and I hired some more.  And then I did, I had to bring in my own staff to be able to (cough) get this perfected.  So, in essence, we did four or five hotels.  We did some specialty work for Extended Stay.  And, and now the rest is history because now we got the, the knack for it for doing the EF and I, paint, carpet, tile, putting in equipment, turning these, these rooms over and these floors over in the, in the proper amount of time, because when they turn a hotel over to you they still can't stop selling the rooms.  So what they want you to do is go in and take a floor where, where they still have patrons living on the, on the, on the next two floors.  So then, in essence, we got to not be able to disturb them.  So then, in essence, we go in there and we do a bottom floor, and we might do a top floor, and then we'll get that floor completely done.  Then we'll move down to the next floor.  Then they can move their patrons up to the floor that we just done.  Then when we get that floor done, we'll move down and they can move patrons up to that floor that we just done.  And then we'll finish the lobby, so to speak, and the hotel's back to where--to normal.  And any hotel owner will not allow you to, to disrupt their, the floor business, but they know they got to modernize and update their, their hotel facilities.  So then, in essence, they want you to be able to get in, get it done, get it done correctly, and get out.  And that's a forte that we finally were able to develop after struggling a little bit.  But we were able to develop that, and, and now we can do Hiltons [Hilton Hotels and Resorts], or Holiday Inns, Comfort Suites, Extended Stay, or whoever wants us to come in and, and renovate their hotel.
Story_ID: 617752
Speaker 1: Did this expertise also become a part of your real estate venture or the part of your business, as far as developing and, and doing homes?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, we dabbled with real estate from the very beginning in '86 [1986], not to this extent.  But, but I decided that the real estate market was very, very viable, that we wanted to get into it, maybe own some commercial real estate space as well as develop some residential space.  So, my family had some land in the southern part of the State of Oklahoma, as well as I went out and purchased some land in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma], as well as maybe doing a few small deals here in, in Dallas, Texas.  So, the major, the major component of what we're doing now in real estate space is that I went up and purchased and owned some land in Oklahoma City called Rose Rock.  And Rose Rock now is a gated community, with homes ranging from, from $3 million down to probably four hundred and fifty thousand dollars.  I owned the northern end of the, of the development.  And then I have a partner, so to speak, that owns the southern end of the residence develop- development.  I own all of phase two, which will also be $12 million homes.  And then, and then I own all of the, the commercial phase of, of that particular development which we're getting ready to build two hotels, two restaurants, and one of the restaurants will be our own, a Prince Bistro, and, and, and, and two office buildings.  One of the office buildings we build will be named after my friend, Dan Honaker [ph.], which will be a Honaker building, which is the guy that sold me the land.  And then the other one will be the Prince building, which is named after us [Prince and Associates, Dallas, Texas].  So, dabbling with that, we're looking at that being a 25, $30 million project on the commercial side.  And then we're looking at the residential side being another 25, $30 million project.  So, Rose Rock residential and Rose Rock commercial, between the two of them, will be over $50 million worth of projects.  But we're building the residential to sell now, but on, on, on the commercial side, we're building this as long term revenue.  So, in essence, when we build a hotel that's long term revenue, we build the restaurants that's long term revenue, we build the, the office building that's long term revenue.  So, hopefully, that revenue is left to, to my family and my family's family as the generations roll down.  So I'm, I'm building what we call a pyramid effect on, on the Rose Rock commercial and residential development.
Story_ID: 617753
Speaker 1: And in 2007, Prince and Associates [Dallas, Texas] start a new venture with the restaurant division.  Is that right?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Would you tell me about your signature restaurant?
Speaker 2: I was approached by Papa John's [Papa John's International, Inc.].  Papa John's said, "We need a large African American minority to become a franchisee."  At first I wasn't interested.  But then they kept coming back.  Hanna Barmeyer [ph.] kept coming back and saying, "Hey, you're a perfect fit.  You got strong business ethics.  You got the capital to, to be able to do this.  And we want to give you Houston [Texas] and San Antonio [Texas]."  I said, "Why can't you give me Dallas [Texas], 'cause I know Dallas?"  They told me, "Dallas is a corporate market owned by Jerry Jones, which owns the Dallas Cowboys."  So I says, "Oh, well, if Jerry Jones owns it, then it must be a good deal because he's a smart businessman, and I respect him."  So, I went out and looked at the plan and looked at this.  And then I said, "Okay, well, it must be a no brainer because Papa John's is one of the top pizza companies in the world."  So we signed an agreement with Papa John's to become the largest African American--black American owned franchisee in the United States.  So then we'll own--we owned, (cough) excuse me, certain specs--certain segments in Houston and certain segments in San Antonio that where we have the rights to be able to build out our Papa John's stores.  I think we're setting records with Papa John's now, because we had four stores open in less than a year, and, and they're all profitable.  And, and we have two of those stores that will probably become million dollar stores.  So, in essence, I think we're doing it right.  But my recipe on the Papa John's is if I can make a thousand dollars a day and own fifty-two Papa John's, all right, that's fifty-two thousand dollars, all right.  Then if I can't make a thousand dollars a day, if I can make a thousand dollars a week times fifty-two Papa John's, that's fifty-two a week.  I know that, that I can do that.  I know that, that, that, that with the formula that, that John [John Schnatter] started with, with Papa John's and his crew- team is, is billed as a recipe for success.  We get a tremendous amount of business from the eight hundred number.  But the Papa John's name and my staff down there are selling it, and I, I don't really have to get involved in it as, as, as, as much as I do my other restaurant venture.  But I anticipate that our relationship with Papa John's will last quite long because from the entry level that we've been into it from the first four stores, and we got another one I think under construction, they're proven to be prite- quite, quite the, profitable.  But on the other hand--and I don't have to spend that much money opening up a Papa John's.  You can do one for very limited capital, and, and, and the return on it is very, very good.
Story_ID: 617754
Speaker 1: But then when you start looking at my Prince Bistros, my staff came up with this idea.  On the Prince Bistros we have three of them in, in, in Dallas [Texas] now, one in Plano [Texas], one in Frisco [Texas], Little Elm [Texas], which is right outside of Frisco, and we have one in Flower Mound [Texas], and we got one in the, under construction in Allen, Texas.  We're gonna build one in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma], and we've got four more locations that we haven't identified.  Cost me roughly about a million bucks [dollars] to, to, to build a Prince Bistro, high end, upscale, full bar, casual, American eatery to where we sell pizzas, wings, salads, and sandwiches, and desserts, and a full bar.  We've got two stores that'll probably be million dollar stores or a million plus dollar stores.  We got one store that's gonna probably be six hundred, seven hundred thousand dollar store.  And then once we open up the Allen store, it looks like projections, it'll be a million plus dollar store.  But the concept is solid.  We have a menu of 6.99 average, with a full bar.  So it differentiates us from, from like a Chili's [Chili's Grill and Bar], or, or, or a T.G.I. Fridays, or a McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation], or a Burger King [Burger King Corporation], or a Wendy's [The Wendy's Company], because we're at that road to where there's no competition, because you can come into our restaurant and get a full service meal, whether it be a salad, sandwich, pizza, or, or wing for 6.99, all right, and a full drink.  If you want to go over to the bar and have a drink, we got a full bar, and still got less than ten bucks.  So, so, in essence, if you go to T.G.I. Friday or if you go to, to Chili's, those are fifteen, twenty dollar per portion ticket plus a tip.  So when I de- developed that formula, I says I want to eliminate the tip because that's 15, 20 percent.  So we'll use a buzzer concept.  You walk in to the cash re- turn your order in and they'll give you a pager; you walk down.  By the time you get your drink and sit down, your buzzer go off; you go back and get your food.  So that eliminates the, the 15 or 20 percent tip, 'cause right now the economy's in such a bad shape, so that 15, 20 percent is a lot of money.  And you want to tip, and you need to tip if these people are waiting on you.  So I eliminated that, came up with it an American flare.  We cook the food as you order it.  And it's been quite successful.  And on the weekends, on Thursdays we have karaoke, and on Friday and Saturday we have live music, which would be jazz or upbeat or rock 'n roll, whatever our constituents want to hear.  And, and I didn't realize that it would take off so quick.  But they are doing--you know, we--every, every restaurant has slow periods between November and, and February because of the holidays.  People will spend their money on Christmas holidays, Thanksgiving, things like that.  But, but we have seen now that the pattern of these restaurants are gonna be so tantamount to the point to where when the weather breaks, we always build them with a patio concept to where they can sit on a patio and watch TV, sit inside, watch TV.  We give them sporting events.  We giving them news.  We give hot topics.  We give them whatever they want to, they want to see on TV.  So the, in essence, when they leave the house, they want to watch news, they can come in our place and still see it.  They leave the house with their family and want the kids to watch Nickelodeon and they watch sports, they can come in our place and see it.  So, so the patio concept, we always try to have a patio that will seat 150 to 200 people.  And then we have the restaurants inside that will seat anywhere from a hundred to two to three hundred people.  The concept's solid.  It's always been tough on new concepts on getting money and finances.  People say well, you've been successful in this here other business, but you might not be successful in this.  We opened up the first store back in June of '07 [2007], so we'll have about a year under our belt pretty soon.  That store is quite successful.  The, the Flower Mound store, which is in a mall, which, which is, is not gathering all the information and all the things that we needed to gather, but we got--it turned around.  But when you got my, my Little Elm store, we opened up gangbusters.  That's gonna be a million plus dollar store easily, maybe a $2 million store.  So, so we can see the potential in our concept.  And we're gonna build our first one from the ground up on my property and on my project in Oklahoma City.  It's gonna cost us quite a bit to build it, but the return on it from a long term point of view, there's nothing else out there.  And we feel like that concept that we're taking to Oklahoma City is gonna turn that place upside down.  So, Prince Bistro is something that, that I had the vision, and my staff came up with the name.  Then we came up with the concept of it, and eventually--don't quote me--but eventually I think it'll be as big as, as, as a T.G.I. Fridays one day, if I live that long and my staff continue to, to, to be motivated to the point that when we open them up they're being successful; they're paying the return that we expect.  So that's my vision that Prince Bistro one day will be as big as a, a T.G.I. Fridays.  And I know Magic [Magic Johnson] likes T.G.I. Fridays, and I like Prince Bistro.
Story_ID: 617755
Speaker 1: And when are you gonna bring one to Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: If, if, if everything goes well (cough), Atlanta is the chocolate city.  They like pizzas; they like wings; and they like salads and sandwiches; and they like a, have a little cocktail every now and then, so we, we have no problems--we have an office in Atlanta, in Roswell [Georgia], so we have no problems with, with branching out to Atlanta.  But at first, I want to get my hands around Dallas [Texas] and Oklahoma City [Oklahoma] 'cause they're close.  And then as we branch out, you got to branch out smart.  And, and, and you got to branch out to the point that where it don't tax you capital wise or resource wise.  And the worst thing in the world for somebody to do is, is branch out too quick and get caught up in that.  And, and I'm watching that real close right now, because as you grow, you gotta grow smart.  And, and, and if I don't grow these Prince Bistros smart, they can get away from me, because you're spending millions and millions of dollars to getting them, getting them open.  Then you got to look at their return over a two or three year period of time.  So the return plan has got to be solid to the point to where you're meeting all of your other obligations, because if you start missing a few, and you got six stores doing good and two stores or three stores doing bad, then you got three stores doing good.  And then, then, then the formula doesn't work, 'cause if you got six stores and three stores doing good, the formula doesn't work.  So, in essence, you're losing money.
Story_ID: 617756
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you're gonna keep all of these, these stores as family owned businesses.  They won't be franchised--
Speaker 2: Absolutely not (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) out?
Speaker 2: I don't believe in partners, and I don't believe in, in, in franchising out our business.  I believe that what we need to do is perfect it.  I'm kind of taking the Cheesecake model.  Every Cheesecake Factory [The Cheesecake Factory, Inc.] in this country is owned by the original owners.  So then, in essence, they've been quite successful at it.  But they're a bigger a scale.  They, those, those 6, $7 million structures with a, with a twenty-five dollar menu price, and I'm a million, million and a half dollar structure with, with, with a 6.99 menu price.  But I'm trying to look at that formula and saying if they've been successful at it for the--and they came out of nowhere.  Now you got Cheesecake Factories everywhere.  But their target is malls.  Our targets is strip centers and, and freeways.  So if we can be just as successful within the strip centers and the freeways as they are in the malls, then we, we're in a no brainer.  But I've got to be able to pick strip centers and freeways that, that will meet our, our taste buds, so to speak, because not everybody wants to come and eat pizza, wings, salads, and sandwiches, where The Cheesecake Factory, you got a myriad of services, plus the cheesecakes that you can go in there and get.  So, in essence, we gotta cater to the constituent that want to, to, to spend 6.99 and get a full meal, fresh meal, in one of the four merits of foods that we have to offer for them, pizza, wings, salad, or sandwich.
Story_ID: 617757
Speaker 1: What do you still want to do that you haven't done yet?
Speaker 2: I guess I want to leave a legacy that through hard work, dedication, surrounding his self with good people, we can be able to maintain a billion dollar business.  And, and that's my goal.  And my, and my thrive in life is, here, here it is, a, a sixth of twelve children, born from a hardworking old man [A.C. Prince, Sr.], with a mother [Daisy Reels Prince] that believed in having children, and, and that was--wasn't poor, but, and I wasn't wealthy, and I went from having one pair of blue jeans and one pair of tennis shoes and a couple of shirts to take me through school.  I looked at those as, as very, very precious days.  And now, as I've gotten older and, and hopefully wiser and successful, I can, I can, I can wear a custom made suit, wear alligator shoes, kind of do some of the things that I want to do in life, enjoy my family, make sure that they're well taken care of.  But when you look back over it and, and you look over it two fold, if I can, can, can leave a legacy that where my family, my staff family, that they children's, that they go to school and get an education, and they graduate from college, the first place that they interview for and a place, first place that they want to come to work, (cough) excuse me, is Prince and Associates [Dallas, Texas], then I, I think I've accomplished my desires and, and, and, and my dreams.  Because my dream is that fifty years from now, the employees that I have working for me now, all hundreds, thousand plus of them that I have working for me now, that their kids, through the relationships that they have with their parents, and they parents go home and tell them how happy they are working for Prince and Associates, that their kids then grow up to want to come and work for Prince and Associates.  And then that keeps it going on and on and on, and then the legacy is twofold.  I only have one child, one daughter.  She's a nurse.
Speaker 1: What is her name?
Speaker 2: Her name's Tamika [Tamika Prince].  She's a nurse.  She has no desires to, to come into her daddy's business because she says I work too much, and I work all the time.  Now she's a nurse, and she work a lot and work all the time.  But she chose the medical field and not the entrepreneurial field because she seen how her daddy works sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, twenty hours a day.  And I can relate to that.  But now, I got all of these family inherited that report to me every day, and I can see their work ethics in them.  And if they don't adopt the same vision and the same work ethics that I have, they won't succeed in working for Prince and Associates.  But I've got people that's been with me since 1986.  I got people that's been with me since 2008.  And I implement a vision and, and a, a, a, a solution on how we gonna get there.  But it's without all these people that I have working for me, and it can't be executed.  So that's why if I had something to do all over again I'd say that my legacy would be that first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth generation family have sought their careers and made a honest living, got, got the finest rewards, and just satisfaction for coming to work, work for Prince and Associates.

Speaker 1: Tell me, how do you want people to remember you?
Speaker 2: You know, that he came up the hard way.  You know, a lot of people that are in position got, got something given to them.  A lot of people get the silver spoon treatment.  Everything that I've accomplished and everything that I've done in my life I've had to work for.  I've had to be aggressive.  I've had to twist things.  I've had to, to turn the other cheek.  I've had to think outside of the box.  I've been slapped.  I've been spit on.  I've been told I had to ride in the back of the bus.  I've been told I couldn't eat here.  I've been told I couldn't play golf here.  I've been told that, that the color of my skin would always be a detriment.  But as we continue to work, and continue to build, and continue to grow, I see the rewards of all of that.  So if you remembered me, if I was to die tomorrow, I want them to put on my tombstone that I didn't die from hard work, because I've been working the way I work now all of my life.

Speaker 1: Because this interview is going to be made available for future generations, what message would you like to send to the future generations, maybe even something about those who want to become entrepreneurs?
Speaker 2: I would tell the future generation, one that wants to become an entrepreneur: understand the preparedness, that if you're not prepared to meet the demands of the responsibilities that you seek, you'll get executed. If you're not prepared to make a presentation to a potential customer, you'll get executed. If you're not prepared (cough) to execute what you have accepted, to obtain the goals and, and, and, and meet the time schedules and the budget restraints that you've accepted, you'll get executed.  So, if I was to say anything to any young entrepreneur, if you're working in Corporate America, don't leave Corporate America until you got a year's worth of contracts or relationships in your hand, because there's no sense in walking away from a hundred thousand, fifty thousand, or sixty thousand dollar job and walk into nothing, because you won't succeed.  I would tell the young entrepreneur that just because you make a hundred thousand dollars, don't spend a hundred thousand dollars, because tomorrow you can make fifty or you could make twenty.  And you got to be able to balance, and you got to be able to build on that balance.  So you got to be able to manage the, the slow periods as well as the good periods, because if you're not able to manage both of those, you're won't be a successful entrepreneur.  Hard work is what it's all about.
Speaker 1: Well, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to share your story with The HistoryMakers.  It's most inspirational.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much, and I appreciate you coming to Dallas, Texas, in the Princeton building and my headquarters and, and visiting with me.
