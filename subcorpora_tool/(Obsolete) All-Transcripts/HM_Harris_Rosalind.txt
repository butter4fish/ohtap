Speaker 1: Let's begin by talking about your, your family history, and let's start on your father's side.  Tell me his name, tell me when and where he was born if you know.
Speaker 2: My father's name is Doyle James.  He is still living.  He was born May 14th, two thousand--I mean, I'm sorry, 1928.  He was born in Amory, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And tell me about him.  What did he do for a living?  Did he share any stories about growing up in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: I don't know that much about him growing up in Mississippi.  He did have several brothers and sisters, some of who are still alive, you know, living in Mississippi.  My Aunt Mavis [ph.], she's a edu- she's an educator at Jackson State [Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi].  I think my other uncle, his brother, they were in the mortuary business.  Boy, you're making me think now (laughter).  It's Mavy, Missy [ph.], and Mary Sue [Mary James].  Those are my three aunts, his--and then it was Uncle Bob [Bob James].  Uncle Bob recently passed.  He was a doctor in Cleveland.  I'm not quite sure.  I forgot.  I thought he was a pathologist, but I'm not quite sure, but he was a doctor in Cleveland.  And then there was Uncle George [ph.].  There was Uncle George and then George Oliver was his son and, and--yeah.  But, I--I'm not sure about his earlier years because he got married when he was seventeen.  He and my mom [Ruth Smith Boyd] got married when he was seventeen.  And I was thinking about this story, though, when I say George Oliver Darden [George Darden]--their, their name--our family, this side of our family was Dardens and my cousin, he used to always put his initials on his papers at school, you know, and his name was George Oliver Darden.  So, one day the teacher said, "Okay, who is god?" (Laughter)  Because that was his initials (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He just put his initials.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I just think of--
Speaker 1: And, and how are you spelling Darden?
Speaker 2: D-A-R-D-E-N.
Story_ID: 610978
Speaker 1: Now, how much education did your father have?
Speaker 2: He, he graduated--he and my mom both graduated from school many, many years later, and my father actually--well, my father did--let me think.  Oh, gosh, you're really making me think.  But, I think both of them graduated--well, I think my father graduated with my brother, the same year that my brother graduated.  He went back and he was going to night school.  But, he worked at General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] for many, many years, I think forty years before he retired.  He used to smoke cigarettes and he stopped smoking cigarettes maybe ten, twenty years ago.  But, he worked at--well, one of the things that was most important about my father was that he was a Little League baseball coach from 1955 to about 1983.  And we had a surprise birthday for him like ten years ago at his seventieth birthday party.  And so at that time ten years ago, some of the players were my age.  So, some of the players were fifty years old.  They were fifty years old looking as old as my dad, you know, some of them.  But, it was a surprise birthday party for him.  But, from 1955 to 1983, he taught lots of little boys.  And, you know, my brothers, I had three--I have three brothers, so he taught--you know, they went through the whole ranks.  From my oldest brother [Michael James], from the--from the age he could start playing to my younger brother [Robin James] to the age he couldn't play.  You know, so all those years, he was a Little League baseball coach.  My editor looked at the brochure--I made a special invitation for this seventieth anniversary and it had pictures of, you know, the 1961 team, 1962 team, so all these pictures, and she looked at it and she says, "My god," she says, "he had white kids, he had Latino kids, and he had black kids.  He had all kinds."  I said, "Yeah, he did."  I never thought about that.  You know, next door where I grew up, it was like Rudy [ph.], Johnny [ph.], and Bado [ph.].  You know, these were my neighbors, you know.  And then their mom's name was Rosa [ph.].  We had--that's where I was eating tortillas at, you know, at a young age.  But, she was so surprised and I--it just never phased me that, you know, the team was--the makeup, they were white, black, and Latino.

Speaker 1: What was your relationship like with your dad [Doyle James]?

He, he and my mom [Ruth Smith Boyd] when they got married, by the time they were thirty-nine, they had been married--unfortunately, they did get a divorce at a young age, but that young age--at that young age of thirty-nine, they still had been married twenty-two years, so that's a long time.  They had six kids within the first ten years of their marriage (laughter), but he was a good dad.  I, I had just talked to him yesterday--well, Tuesday after we found out--
Speaker 1: What is a characteristic that you think you received from your father?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  He was kind and gentle man, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And had--patient, liked to talk.  He was sweet.  He's--he is sweet.  He is very sweet.

Speaker 1: Now, what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We like to drink beer together.  He always--he always offered me beer 'cause I used to drink beer with him when I was real little (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you had a--when you were, were--
Speaker 2: When I was--
Speaker 1: --a child?
Speaker 2: A slug of beer.  So, you know, now, he says, "Rosey [HistoryMaker Rosalind Juanita Harris], you want a beer?"  "Yeah, daddy, let me have a beer."  Yeah.  That's probably the only time now I ever drink beer, just when I go home and see my dad.
Speaker 1: What are the little relationship things that you all share?  Can you think of any?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  He used to tease me 'cause I have very small ears, and he said he was going to get me some ear stretchers.  And I used to always ask him, "Daddy, when are you gonna get my ear stretchers?"  You know, but he used to tease me because I have very little ears and I still do, but that's one of the things he used to tease me about, yeah.

Speaker 1: All right.  And you said you remember her, but did you spend any time with her?
Speaker 2: A little bit, whenever we went to Mississippi, you know, to visit because she was in Mississippi.  Yeah, yeah.  She used to smoke a little pipe, used to love to watch 'Gunsmoke.'  I do remember that, 'Gunsmoke.'  There was another show she liked to watch.  And I only remember this because when I was going to school, I wrote an article about my grandmother, wrote something about her, and I did indicate.  I said, yes, she used to like to watch 'Gunsmoke,' I wanna say 'The Price is Right' but I'm not sure 'The Price is Right' was around that time.  Maybe it was.
Speaker 1: It might've been a game show?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And where she lived in Mississippi, did they live on a farm?
Speaker 2: Boy, that's been so long ago, too.  I don't remember the farm animals.  I don't think it was a farm.  Yeah, I don't think it was a farm.

But my grandmother on my mother's side and my father's side, they were always in--they moved to Grand Rapids [Michigan].  So, when they moved to Grand Rapids, that's when my mom and dad [Doyle James] moved to Grand Rapids.  They had gotten married, my mom being an only child and my mom and--my mother--my grandmother and grandfather when they moved to Grand Rapids.  And I think my grandfather worked on the train.

You know, it was just their little thing, Miss Smith, that was his wife.  I remember my grandfather, he was very--he was a kind of big, boisterous man.  But when he'd laugh, he'd have this, just--oh, this, you know, just this wonderful laugh and this wonderful glow about himself.  He was a deacon in the church.  I remember every Sunday we'd--if we were over there--I mean, we, we were six--we were the six kids of an only child, so we--they spoiled us.  You know, they spoiled us and they--because she was the only child.  But then she had six babies.  I don't know if she was making up, because she didn't have any more, but (laughter).  But I remember we used to call him Big Daddy.  That was his nickname, Big Daddy.  He died of cancer some, some years ago, but his name was Big Daddy.  And I still remember things of him playing where he'd run around the coffee table with us when we were little and he'd run across the--run across the coffee table.  My grandmother never learned to drive a car, you know.  All her life, she never--she--you know, she was just, you know, very dependent on Big Daddy, never drove a car.  She was very sweet, soft spoken, soft spoken.  She made the greatest--the best sweet potato pies, best sweet potato pies.  She always had the--what were those crackers in the green box.  That kind of--you know, not saltine, kind of buttery?  What were those crackers?  She always had those crackers.  She always had--
Speaker 1: I can't think of--
Speaker 2: What were those crackers?  Town- not Town House, not the Town House.  They were like the little squares where you'd break them all loose, yeah.  She'd have those.  She'd always have, you know, either the butterscotch or the mint candies there.  I actually still have a, a, a, a--like a candy dish that she had at my house.  It's gotta be forty, fifty years old at least.

Story_ID: 610982
Speaker 1: So is there a story about how your mother [Ruth Smith Boyd] and father [Doyle James] met?
Speaker 2: Probab- I would, I would assume probably in school, yeah.  I would assume, but--they were the same age, so--

Speaker 2: Yeah, she followed her mom [Avinger Smith] and dad [Neal Smith] (laughter).

Speaker 2: In Grand Rapids, he was at General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company]--

Speaker 2: I, I think--I think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, thinking back, what is your earliest childhood memory about your, about your family?
Speaker 2: I think the fun that we had, you know, as a family because there were six of us and, you know--well even before.  I mean, I remember the, the younger years, the younger years.  The house we grew up in, we lived on this--end of this house--end of the street.  It was on Maplewood [Drive]--was it Maplewood?  No, 311 Place Street [ph.].  I think that's what it was.  At that--at that house, we had a grapevine in the backyard, we had two peach trees, an apple tree, so we had a lot of fruit, you know, which, you know, I, I don't think it was real common.  I mean, you see that stuff I think in California a lot, but we did have an apple tree, a pear, two peach trees, and a grapevine on, on that.  So, it was--it was fun.  It was a big space.  It was at the end of the house--I mean, end of the street.  There was only really about three or four houses there.  The other thing though that was interesting is there was a hill, you know, from--there was a hill at the end and we, we were not to go down there because that's where the hobos lived, the hobos.  You know, there was train tracks and hobos there.  I never went.  But, you know, my oldest brother, Michael [Michael James], he ventured there.  He would venture, you know.  Michael was the daring one.  And he--anything that they say don't do, that was Michael (laughter).
Story_ID: 610983
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about your brothers and sisters.  Can you list their names?  Give me a little bit about each one of them.

Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and tell me where you fit in.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My oldest brother, Michael, Michael Anthony James [Michael James].  He was--he actually died in about 1984.  He was--I don't know if he was a--say he was a rebel, but he was just the oldest one and he kept everybody in- intact.  But everyone loved Michael.  Women loved Michael.  You can see that by the children that he left behind, you know, and--you know, right now.  And I, I met some in August that I'd--some of my nephews that I didn't even know I had.  I mean, I--for, for the first time in August.  They're thirty years old, getting ready to get married.  So, Michael--I miss Michael's dancing, because, you know, we used to dance together.  You know, we used to dance together.  (Background noise) People used to say we looked alike because at that time, he had a big Afro, I had a big Afro.  And, and one story that I've always liked to share is I was driving down the street one time and somebody was just blowing the horn, blowing the horn, blowing the horn.  And I don't know if it was--I, I was in my, my car or Michael's car, and they're blowing the horn.  And all of a sudden, I pulled over and one of his friends said, "Oh, Bee Bee [HistoryMaker Rosalind Juanita Harris], I thought you were Michael," you know, because you couldn't see--my hair.  I said--but that was back in the, you know, Afro days, [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis days, you know, black power days.  But, but he did die in 19--I think 1984, around there.  He had a heart attack, yeah.  My older sister, Jacqueline [Jacqueline James], she's a retired educator from--in Atlanta [Georgia], just recently married, married her childhood sweetheart from home, from Grand Rapids.  They had been high school sweethearts and after forty years, they get back together and just recently got married.  She's got one daughter and, and her daughter's got a daughter.  Yeah, she's a--she was teaching in the Atlanta Decatur--DeKalb County [Georgia] schools for many, many years, many, many years.  Yeah, like I said, she just recently got married.  My, my other brother, Dante James, you might have--you may have heard of him.  He--he's a filmmaker.  He did 'Slavery and the Making of America,' you know the, the documentary.  And he did, you know, docu- let's see, Marian, Marian Anderson, 'This Far by Faith.'  He's done several documentaries.  He was--he was working for W--what's that station in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]?

I moved away when I was nineteen--well twenty with a one year old in tow, you know, never looked back (laughter).  I moved to Minneapolis [Minnesota]--yeah, I moved to Minneapolis.  I had a couple girlfriends there, lived in Minneapolis for about four years.  After that, I moved to Omaha [Nebraska].

Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --get back to them.
Speaker 2: So after me--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --is my youngest sister.  So, it went boy, girl, boy, girl, girl, boy.  That's how--you know.  My, my sister, her name is Muriel and her middle name is Doyle James.  And I think she got the middle name of my father's name because they weren't sure if they was gonna have another boy, so they, they put Doyle in there, but her name is Muriel Doyle James [Muriel James].  And--but she--she's, right now, I think she's working with the housing, you know, housing--like Denver housing--or Grand Rapids Housing Authority [Grand Rapids Housing Commission] or something, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, she's still in Michigan?
Speaker 2: She's still in Grand Rapids, yes.

Story_ID: 610984
Speaker 1: So now you're--you have six children in the, the family and lots going on, and you alluded to a phone call that you received that changed the course of this week, and that's about your mother [Ruth Smith Boyd] and I'm very sorry to hear about your loss.  But let's talk a little bit about her.  Share about your feelings about your mom even in your growing up and, and now until adulthood, how you feel (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --about her.
Speaker 2: My mom was a very caring mom.  I mean, most moms are, but she was.  Between the six, six of us, she worked at--well, she was a stay at home mom for a long time.  Yeah, she was a stay at home mom with us for a long time.  At the time she did start going to work, she was a dietician at the--at the hospital.  And I always remember the stories--well, I was--I always like to share this story because she would always leave us money to go down to the corner to get an ice cream cone.  So, every day, she would leave a quarter and a nickel, you know.  Ice cream cones were five cents.  Every day, that's what she would leave for us to go down to the corner to get ice cream.  And, and I think about that, thirty cents, you know, every day, and that was probably a hard thirty cents, you know, but, but, you know, with raising six kids at that time.  But she, she sacrificed a lot.  And I say she sacrificed a lot because I don't think she--I don't think she completed her high school.  I--well, let me take that back because I kind of think they both did at one time, so I, I want to take that back, yeah.  But we, we had a good time.  Growing up, she taught us the values of having a clean house.  She always said I was her best one--I was the best--her best dish washer, you know, because we washed dishes.  She'd say, "I can always tell when Bee Bee [HistoryMaker Rosalind Juanita Harris] cleaned the kitchen 'cause she, she does everything," you know, and I always take pride on that.  When we grew up, we had only two bedrooms, so the girls slept in one bedroom, the boys slept in another bedroom.  You know, I think it was--it must've been just a three bedroom house [in Grand Rapids, Michigan], but I do remember we all slept in one, boys slept in another.  We--at, at one time, though when we did move to another house, 1111 Dunham [Street], we did have more bedrooms.  That's when we were moving up (laughter).  But, my mom--I think what I'd like to share, too, is that she--my, my father [Doyle James], you know, was a Little League baseball coach and my mom would always provide hot dogs.  She was the mom of all of 'em.  You know, so all these guys that went through the ranks with being on that baseball team, she was the mom of them also.  As a matter of fact at the seventieth birthday party for my father, she was a little bit reluctant about going because they were not to- you know, they weren't together, you know, because they hadn't been together.  I said, "Mom, you're coming to this party."  And she came and it was special because all the baseball players that was there treated her to a rose to the song of the Boyz II Men, mother ['A Song for Mama'].
Story_ID: 610985
Speaker 1: You were telling us about your mother [Ruth Smith Boyd] and your father's [Doyle James] seventieth birthday.  Was there more to that story?
Speaker 2: It was wonderful.  It was wonderful.  You know, because she was a little reluctant because, you know, of course they had been divorced for many years.  But all the baseball players, she was the mom to all of them.  And I think it was a, a bigger surprise as--my father's--it was my father's birthday party, but she got, you know, recognized and honored there also because it was kind of nice to have, I don't know, forty, fifty men, you know, walking around to her, giving her a rose to the tune of the Boyz II Men, you know, mom--what's the song?  "Mom, I love you," ['A Song for Mama'], you know, remember that beautiful song?  Yeah, so it was a great tribute for both of them.

Speaker 1: My mom [Ruth Smith Boyd], you know, of course, she stressed education, you know, for all of us and encouraged us all, you know, to get the education.  'Cause I guess, you know, she was--as an elder coming from the South, she knew the value of education.  And it just makes me think, you know--I mean, Barack [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] says it so well.  You know, you know how the older--the elders, you know, they couldn't do it but they gonna make a way so that your children can do it.  So, I think that every--you know, many people feel that way.  You know, they couldn't do it, you know, but, you know, they're gonna try and make a way for their children and their grandchildren to do what they couldn't do.

Speaker 1: What were your mem- what are your memories of holidays at your house [in Grand Rapids, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Holidays was fun (laughter).  Holidays was fun.  We may--we may have five dollars between us to, you know, to go get Christmas presents.  And I remember there was a variety store down at the--you know, down on Wealthy Street, I think it was, and we may have five dollars and come out with a rabbit foot.  I remember buying a rabbit foot for my mother Michael [Michael James], I think a bowl for my mom [Ruth Smith Boyd], you know, things that cost fifty cents or a quarter.  And, so it was--it was fun, you know.  Christmas, we'd have the, the tree, all kinds of presents.  We'd, we'd get so many presents, you know.  Of course, we'd end up counting them.  You know, every year, we--it may have been a pair of socks in one, but, you know, we'd count them every year.  It may have been a hundred and something presents, you know, just all--just all over the house.  And I remember, you know, my dad [Doyle James] doing the--you know, he was doing things with putting the bikes together, you know.  Our holidays was good and the Thanksgivings, Halloweens.  Oh, the Halloweens, let me go back to the Halloweens.  My brother, Michael, and, and Dante [Dante James], you know, they would come back with pillowcases full of candy, pillowcases, you know.  Then, my mom would take the candy, she'd take the candy and it'd be distributed probably for the whole year.  She'd take the candy--she'd take the candy and give a little bit.  It was just our treats, but that's what they'd do.  She--he'd have pillowcases full of food--I mean, candy.  One other thing, too, about Christmas, my brother, they'd always find the presents.  They'd find the Christmas presents every year.  You know, wherever they were hidden, so that's how they did that (laughter).
Speaker 1: If I were to ask you about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And Easter, though, we dressed up.
Speaker 1: Oh, Easter?
Speaker 2: You know, Easter.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me about Easter.
Speaker 2: Easter.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Easter.  We were--yeah, Easter.  We would have--because I said, we were--went to church all the time, every Sunday at True Light Baptist [True Light Baptist Church, Grand Rapids, Michigan] and we'd have our Easter bonnets and our Easter speeches.  Everyone did their Easter speeches.  Abide in me and I'm--you, you know, I can almost remember that, John 15:4, you know, when I was little, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's your earliest memory of, of religion or church?
Speaker 2: What, Easter?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: No, we would go all the time, you know.
Story_ID: 610988
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What's your earliest memory about church (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) From church?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Oh, we'd go to the Baptist church.  You know, the shouting, the singing, foots, you know, stomping.  You know, we'd, we'd, we'd actually--when we got a little bit older, we'd actually kind of predict who was gonna be shouting (laughter).  But, it was good.  It was True Light Baptist [True Light Baptist Church, Grand Rapids, Michigan].  Reverend Patterson [W.L. Patterson].  He was the pastor for many, many years.  And I think his son [H.C. Patterson] is the pastor now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did you get the--
Speaker 2: And like I said, my, my [maternal] grandfather [Neal Smith] was a deacon.  My mom--my grandmother [Avinger Smith] was a--oh, I guess all on the usher board and, and she was--she was one of the mothers of the churches, and she'd be sitting in that front row.
Speaker 1: And, and how did they dress?  Did the mothers wear white?
Speaker 2: White, um-hm, white, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you remember anything about Sunday school?
Speaker 2: About Sunday school?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but not too much, just Sunday school, yeah.  I don't think we went to Sunday school too much, yeah, but church, um-hm.
Story_ID: 610989
Speaker 1: Speaking about the church [True Light Baptist Church, Grand Rapids, Michigan], let's talk more about the community.  What's your earliest memory of the community in which you lived?  Tell me about your neighbors and your friends and--say--
Speaker 2: When growing up?
Speaker 1: Take me on a tour--no, just in the time, like elementary school, your earliest memories of the neighborhood in which you lived.  Let's just stay in the, the area of say elementary school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But the neighborhood--we're gonna talk about your elementary school as well, but just about the neighborhood.  Take me on a tour of what the neighborhood looked like, and who lived there and who your friends were.
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: So, tell me about your neighborhood.
Speaker 2: When I went to grade school, it was Maplewood [Maplewood School, Grand Rapids, Michigan].  And actually, you know, I was--I was--I think I was telling you we lived at the end of the street.  And the way I could get actually to my school is there was a--there was a fence around the school and there was an opening, so I actually could go to school from the back way, you know, getting through that fence.  And one of the stories my mom [Ruth Smith Boyd] always used to talk about is that when I was in the first, first grade or second grade, I'm gonna say--I think it may have been the first grade after kindergarten 'cause I was going to school all day.  And they said I was gonna be in Miss--oh, I forgot her name.  I think it was like Crabtree [ph.] or something.  I was gonna be in her class, they appointed me to be in her class, and she was like the meanest teacher.  They--you know, I mean, her--word, word was out that she was the meanest teacher in the school.  And so I'm in line going to that classroom with her, you know, going to the classroom, I'm in line.  I happen to be the last person in, in line.  Everybody was going into the room and I went out the door, went through that parking lot, and went to that fence and went home (laughter).  They didn't know where I was.  My mom--and then they were all worried and they said--I said, "I'm not gonna be in that mean lady's class."  So, you know, that was a story that my mom always tell.  But, I said, no, so they changed the class.  They changed it.  I said, "I'm not gonna be in her class," yeah.  But, the area, it wasn't--we didn't have a whole lot of money, you know, that I'm sure we--you know, I think we probably had our share of maybe rodents, you know.  I don't remember no roaches, you know, but, you know, I think because of where we lived and what we had, I do remember we had mousetraps or things like that.  You know, and it may have been because we had apple trees and we had this and we had that, yeah.  Our neighbors next door, like I said, was Randy--I mean, Rudy [ph.], Johnny [ph.], and Bado [ph.].  They were Latino.  Those were basically all the ones I remember because it was only about three or four houses on that whole block.  And their mother, Rosa [ph.]--I think her name was Rosa, Rosa, yeah, that's where I was--learned about all my Mexican food.  I mean, she was frying those tortillas up on a frying pan and, and very close to them.  As a matter of fact at the seventieth anniversary party, Bado was there, and he was my age, so like--I mean, it's good to see somebody you done known fifty something, you know, fifty, fifty years, at least fifty years.  So, that, that, that community wasn't, wasn't that--too much activity because we weren't living there that long.
Story_ID: 610990
Speaker 1: Then we moved over--then we moved to 1111 Dunham [Street].  Now that--oh and I went to--I went to--let's see, grade school.  I went to Franklin [Franklin School, Grand Rapids, Michigan] also.  After going to Maplewood [Maplewood School, Grand Rapids, Michigan] for a couple--you know, for kindergarten, first, and second, then, I went to Maplewood I thi- Franklin for third grade--maybe third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade, and sixth grade.  So I went to--yeah, at the middle school.  Oh, that was after we moved to Dunham, though.  We moved to Dunham and, and that was getting into my high school years, and that's where I met all my good girlfriends who are still my very good girlfriends.  I lived on 1111 Dunham Street.  I had some--so, I lived here, then street down about a block down was a street called Neland, Neland Street [sic. Neland Avenue].  And this--so, Toni [Toni Matthews (ph.)] lived on Neland, Olivia [Olivia Lewis (ph.)] lived on Neland, so when we'd go to school, we'd had this same little routine, Toni and--Toni and Olivia would meet, they'd come down to my street and pick me up, go down the street and we'd pick up Patti Jo [Patti Jo Hill (ph.)], go up the street and we'd pick up Eva [ph.] and walk to school.  So, that was our route all year long.  That, that was the days when we walked to school, snow, you know.  Now--nowadays, you know, and I know everyone hears it.  Kids take the bus or they, you know, gotta get a ride.  Well, that was when we walked to school.  It was--it wasn't a--it was a walk.  It was a walk.  But we would--that was our routine, Toni and Olivia and they'd pick me up and pick up Patti Jo, Eva, and then there was one other one.  I think it was Cynthia Porter [ph.].  She met us because she was kind of--a little bit off the beaten path, but those were my friends that I went to high school [Ottawa Hills High School, Grand Rapids, Michigan] with up until the eleventh grade.
Speaker 2: Okay, but let's go back a little bit.
Speaker 1: About the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: To the--yeah, to talk about the neighborhood, Dunham.  You, you were--you said you moved there like the fourth or fifth grade?
Speaker 1: I think--I think so because--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No, Franklin--Franklin, Franklin.  Franklin was just the third grade.  Oh, let me go back, no.  Franklin--I went to a Catholic school for a couple of years.  Yeah, so I was on Dunham.  I was just trying to think, where were those other couple of years?  'Cause I went to a Catholic school after I, I had moved to--after we moved to Dunham.  My dad [Doyle James]--you know, you, you--my sister, my youngest sister [Muriel James], my youngest brother [Robin James] and I, we all went to a Catholic school for a few years until I went to high school.
Speaker 2: So, you went to Franklin--
Speaker 1: So, I was still living on Dunham.  I was still--yeah, I think--third grade, I was at--third and fourth grade, we were still over on Church Place.
Speaker 2: At Maplewood.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Maplewood.  Well, it's--Maplewood is kindergarten, first, and second--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and then Franklin was third grade--was it third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade, and then it was St. Stephens [St. Stephen Catholic School, Grand Rapids, Michigan].  'Cause when I was thirteen, when I was thirteen, I was going to a Catholic school when President John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] died.  I remember that so distinctly because, of course, everyone remembers where you were when he died.  Sister Marie Therese [ph.], she came in and, and said that he had died.  And, of course, you know, being in a Catholic school, the next day was a holiday, you know.  And, and at that school, I think I was probably the only black, you know.  I think there was only a couple of African Americans.  And I, I, I don't remember any more actually.  I just remember me.  But--yeah, but I do remember that.  And I was thirteen, so it was 1963.  I think I was--I think that was the seventh grade.  That would've been seventh grade at St. Stephens or eighth grade (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So--
Story_ID: 610991
Speaker 1: So your years at Franklin [Franklin School, Grand Rapids, Michigan] and living on Dunham [Street], talk to me about living on Dunham.  Now, you moved.  What, what is the area or the community like there?
Speaker 2: It was a more progressive community I would say (laughter).  We had a big--you know, at that time, we thought it was a big yard and, you know, we had a two car garage and the garage actually had a little--a, a down--a downstairs in the garage, so um-hm.  We had upstairs.  I think everybody had their room.  You know, we must've shared.  I don't know who shared.  I can't even remember, but we probably had about four bedrooms and that still probably wasn't enough for six kids.  But, yeah, I vividly remember, remember we had the upstairs.
Speaker 1: So, your friends that lived in the community, what did their parents do and was this--were most of your friends living in two parent households?
Speaker 2: You know what?  Yeah, um-hm, yeah, at that time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did the other of your friends' parents work for GM [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] as well?
Speaker 2: I think they do.  Yeah, Patti Jo's--Patti Jo Hill [ph.], her--let me see, her--I think her father--no, either, either her father or her mother I think did.  But, yeah, she was two parent, Olivia Lewis [ph.], I think everybody had two parents, just about, um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I can't think of anyone that--yeah, I think we all had two parent.
Story_ID: 610992
Speaker 1: What were some of the other activities that you were involved in?
Speaker 2: At school?
Speaker 1: At, at, at school.
Speaker 2: At school, outside of--one of the things that I went to and I saw [HistoryMaker] Dorothy Height.  It was a long time ago.  It was Lambda Kappa Mu [Lambda Kappa Mu Sorority, Inc.] and I'm not quite sure how or why I was involved in this program or project, but we even went to--we stayed at the Waldorf Astoria.  I was really young, you know, and I'm not quite sure, but--how old was I?  But it was some event.
Speaker 1: What do you remember about it?
Speaker 2: I, I--and I, I started working young, very young, too.  I worked--I started working when I was about fourteen before I could drive.  And at one time, I had three jobs.  My mom [Ruth Smith Boyd] used to--and this is a good story.  This, this is a good story.  My mom used to drive me around from this job to this job to this job.  I remember I was working at this one little place.  It was a, a buck an hour 'cause the guy said, "I pay a buck an hour," that's what it was.  I--you know, and that's what I was getting.  Then I worked at--it was--I always worked at little restaurants, you know, little cafes.  So, I worked at this one and that's where I was getting the dollar an hour.  This other one was Dog 'n' Suds [Grand Rapids, Michigan].  It was like a little--where they--you know, the little--the cars come up, you know, and they order the food and you bring the food out.  So, that was Dog 'n' Suds.  Now, the third one I worked at--well, that one--no, I worked at Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.].  I think I, I don't know.  I think it was Sears.  Wow, it was a different one.  It wasn't just a restaurant.  But they were all part-time jobs.  They were all part-time jobs.  And my grandmother, the one--my mom's mom [Avinger Smith], she used to say well, "Bee Bee [HistoryMaker Rosalind Juanita Harris], you can't make up--you can't make all the money you know," (laughter).  That's what she'd say.  "You can't make all the money."  And I mean, my mom, you know, she'd pick me up.  She'd just, you know, take me.  She'd, you know, pick me up for every little job and run me to another one, then run me to another one, run me to another.  That's all she would do.  She had this little old white Corvair [Chevrolet Corvair], this little old white car, and that's what she--that's what she would do, but.  I started working like when I was fourteen, fourteen, fifteen.
Story_ID: 610993
Speaker 1: Well, what type of student were you?
Speaker 2: I was good (laughter).  I was good.  I, I liked school.  As a matter of fact, I got a scholarship to go to school.  I--yeah, I got a scholarship to go to school.  I went for one year, then I got pregnant and, and--
Speaker 1: Well, before, before we go to that story, let--let's try and stay in--we're in junior high school [St. Stephen Catholic School, Grand Rapids, Michigan] getting ready to go to high school 'cause we haven't gotten to high school yet.  But--so you're a good student.  What other activities are you--is there any music or arts or athletics?
Speaker 2: You know, I, I did enjoy art.  I enjoyed basketball even though I was real short, but, you know, I did enjoy basketball.  I enjoyed art a lot.  And this--and right now, I'm the art director of my newspaper [Denver Urban Spectrum].  I used to take--you know, and I'd take the art classes, you know, and I could draw.  I could--you know, they'd say, "You're taking the easy classes or the fun classes," you know, but I did.  But, I did.  I took math.  I took math.  I took calculus.  I took--I loved math.  I at one point wanted to be a math--thought I would want to be a math teacher.  I took Spanish for four years.  I'd, I'd love to start back, you know, working on it because we--I need to learn it now.  I need to know how to speak it now.  But, Spanish--oh, I was gonna tell you something else and I just forgot.  Maybe it'll come--
Speaker 1: Activities in school.
Speaker 2: Oh, when I moved--when actually, when I went to another school, I went from Ottawa--I was at Ottawa High School [Ottawa Hills High School, Grand Rapids, Michigan] until eleventh grade and then my, my mom [Ruth Smith Boyd] and dad [Doyle James] got a divorce and I moved to--we, we moved back to almost--back to other side of town, and then I went to another school.  I went to South High School [Grand Rapids, Michigan].  Ottawa High School was, was predominantly, predominantly a white school with maybe a small percentage of African American.  And then when I moved over--you know, when we moved back on the West Side [Grand Rapids, Michigan], the school was maybe the total opposite.  It was predominantly African American.  And so it was kind of a, a little--a little different.  But, you know, I was well received.  I was on the homecoming court.  They didn't have a queen and king, but I was one of the six that was on the homecoming court, which was--which was pretty cool.  That was a good reception.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you involved in church activities during your junior high school years?
Speaker 2: Not too much, no, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 610994
Speaker 1: You went to Franklin [Franklin School, Grand Rapids, Michigan], then you went to the St. Stephens [St. Stephen Catholic School, Grand Rapids, Michigan].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Actually, it was Maplewood [Maplewood School, Grand Rapids, Michigan] first.
Speaker 1: Maplewood, right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause that was the kindergarten first.  Maplewood elementary and then--and then Franklin.  Because Maplewood was only just I think kindergarten--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --first and second.  And then--and then Franklin, St. Stephens.
Speaker 1: Why did your parents [Ruth Smith Boyd and Doyle James] decide to send you to Catholic school?
Speaker 2: My father was an Episcopalian and he just thought it was a better education for us.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you went through junior high school and then the first high school that you went to--now, as far--
Speaker 2: And, and you know what?  And it's interesting because I was not Catholic.  I--the years that I went, I never took--I never took--
Speaker 1: Religious instructions.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I just went there for the education, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you never attended the church services at all?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, no.
Speaker 1: Always went to the Baptist church [True Light Baptist Church, Grand Rapids, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: And it was--you know, and I, and I can say frankly it was pretty uncomfortable for me.  You know, it wasn't the greatest environment.
Speaker 1: And you said you were the only African American that you can remember.
Speaker 2: I think I was and my brother [Robin James] and my sister [Muriel James], yeah.
Speaker 1: And how were you received there because you talked about (unclear) that you were received well, but how did you fit in in the Catholic school?
Speaker 2: At the Catholic school?  I don't--it wasn't--I, I don't--I won't say that it was the best.  That's probably why I forgot about telling you about it 'cause I didn't even--it wasn't the greatest experience.  You know, I mean, it was just--it was just go, go, go to school and come back, you know, and that's all it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, now, what year did you graduate from junior high school or come out of--going into high school?
Speaker 2: Well, I graduated from high school [South High School, Grand Rapids, Michigan] in '68 [1968], so--
Speaker 1: Okay, go back the four years.
Speaker 2: So, it should've been--
Speaker 1: So, it was '64 [1964]?
Speaker 2: Should've been around '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: But, those schools, they went consec- they went from seventh through twelfth grade.  So, it wasn't any--
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.  It went seventh through twelfth grade.
Story_ID: 610995
Speaker 1: What other experiences at your high school--now, talk to me a little bit more about your moves from, you know, you, you say your mother [Ruth Smith Boyd] and father [Doyle James] got divorced and--let--give a little more detail about that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was--that was--
Speaker 1: --and how you were feeling about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was a--that was a stressful--yeah, that, that was a stressful time.  I mean, we were the family like the, the Cosbys or whatever.  You know, I mean, Cosbys in this day but, you know, we were the family that, you know, everyone thought we were--you know, these--my father--my father was a baseball coach, you know, for many, many years, and you know, we were the typical great little happy family.  You know, and they'd come over in our yard and we'd be--make up our own little baseball team.  You know, we had enough to have our own little baseball team, you know, between the eight of us.  And, so it was--it was happy times, but, you know, when the divorce came, it was--it was unfortunate.  It was a sad time, because I, I--and when my mom decided no more, she went, you know, to where my [maternal] grandmother [Avinger Smith] and my grandfather [Neal Smith] was living.  I went with my mom.  I was the only one who went with my mom, yeah, and everyone else was still at home.  But, I went with my mom (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, okay, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, the rest of your siblings stayed with your dad.
Speaker 2: They stayed home.  My--and at that time, too, my oldest sister, Jacqueline [Jacqueline James], the one who's from Atlanta [Georgia], she kind of took care of my youngest, because they were there.  My--you know, this was the time where it was changes and it was a little bit turmoil because my oldest--my oldest brother, he was out with girlfriends, you know, having--Michael [Michael James], having children, you know, planting his seeds all over (laughter) Grand Rapids [Michigan].  And then my, my other brother Dante [Dante James], who's the filmmaker, and the one who just called me on the phone, he was actually in the [U.S.] military but, you know, he was just--I mean, it was--it was a time.  I don't know, I'm thinking about.  It was a time of rebellion maybe, you know, because he went AWOL [Absent Without Official Leave].  He said he, he wasn't in the service, not--he--
Speaker 1: So, what, what year was this?  Was Vietnam [Vietnam War] (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was around 1968, yeah, around there.
Story_ID: 610996
Speaker 1: And then that was the time.  That was the Vietnam [Vietnam War] days.  There were more friends of ours--actually, my, my sister's [Jacqueline James] age coming back in boxes, coming back in boxes.  You know, that was the Marvin Gaye era, that was the 'Hot Buttered Soul' era--you know, era, when you, you know, you're riding down the street and you'd hear 'Hot Buttered Soul' in the--in the diamond rooftop.  You know, you just booming, and--or Marvin Gaye, 'What's Going On?'  You know, it was--it was during that time.  It was also the time when, you know, they had the, the blue light parties down in the basement.  You know--you know, turn them lights on down there (laughter).  You know, so it was--it was that time.  I think--you know, and that was--I don't know, that's--was that Woodstock [Woodstock Festival; Woodstock Music and Art Fair]?  Wasn't Woodstock around 1968?  It was all that time.  It was that time of change, Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], and, and Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] and Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy], Black Panthers [Black Panther Party], you know, all of that.
Speaker 2: Were--was your family involved in civil rights at all?
Speaker 1: We weren't.  You know, we weren't.  And, and the other thing, too, you know, we were right--you know, we were in Grand--you know, I think about this because we were not that far from Detroit [Michigan] and that was Motown [Motown Records].  You know, Motown is just on--you know, and I never realized it.  But, you know, if I--if I--probably if I had a car and I could've drove, I would've been more in Detroit (laughter).  But, you know, Motown, we were right there with The Supremes and Stevie Wonder, and, you know, and all the--you know, all of that was just thriving, [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy, just had it going on.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: But, now, they--we--they--we were--they, they were protective of us.  They--you know, they, they were--they were fairly strict, um-hm, they were fairly strict.
Speaker 2: So, your brother in the [U.S.] military, he went AWOL [Absent Without Official Leave] and--
Speaker 1: He did.
Speaker 2: --what was--
Speaker 1: He went--
Speaker 2: Was there a story behind that?
Speaker 1: He, he went a few years, you know, but, you know, and I don't even remember.  But, you know, he just was out there for a couple of years and I guess finding himself, and he has because he's a great filmmaker right now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Well established, Dante J. James [Dante James].  You can Google him (laughter).
Story_ID: 610997
Speaker 1: Now in high school, had you been thinking about going to college?  Was that something that was always in your mind that you would do?  And was there a teacher either in any of the grades?  Does--well, tell me, was there a teacher in, in elementary school, junior high school or high school that you remember that might've been inspirational--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --or encouraging to you?
Speaker 2: Mary--let me see, it's--well, there was--I'm trying to think of her name.  I'm looking at her face.  She lived near--actually, she was my third grade teacher.  Doggone it.  It's terrible.  I can't remember her name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But there have been some--there's been several women that were real ins- instrumental in molding me to the person that I am today.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mary, but I can't think of her last name.  I think she's about my third grade teacher, though, third or fourth grade [at Franklin School, Grand Rapids, Michigan], yeah.  She was African American.  And, yeah, she was great.  There was another--I, I was very good friends with this, this, this white girl.  Her name was Barbara Anderson [ph.], and her mom actually was the one--instrumental with me--providing me with the scholarship to go to college.  She was a counselor.
Story_ID: 610998
Speaker 1: --About Barbara Anderson [ph.] and her role in the scholarship.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Barbara Anderson.  She was a very good friend of mine, quite close, and her mom was instrumental in getting me the scholarship.  And actually, it was a four year scholarship, and I didn't fulfill it.  I got pregnant and--you want to talk about that now (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yes, you--yeah.  Because you graduated in--
Speaker 2: I graduated.
Speaker 1: --from high school [South High School, Grand Rapids, Michigan] and what college did you--were you going to attend?
Speaker 2: Actually, you know what, I went to Davenport business college [Davenport College of Business; Davenport University, Grand Rapids, Michigan].  Yeah, I went--I went there for a year.  Yeah, I went there for a year.  You know what?  I go back--you know, I didn't--I went to Davenport business college for one year.  Then, I moved to Minnesota.
Speaker 1: How did you make a decision to go to, to the business college?  This was straight out of high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, it was one year.  I think it was one year after.
Speaker 1: One year after high school.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, one year after, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, you, you had your, your child [Lawrence James] right after high school or the year after?
Speaker 2: Right, right after.
Speaker 1: Right--
Speaker 2: In, in 1969.  I graduated in 1968.  That's why I didn't--I didn't use--I didn't go--I didn't use that scholarship.
Speaker 1: And then you went to the business college.
Speaker 2: And then I went to the business college for--actually, I went to business school that year because we moved when he was a year old.  We moved in 1970, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you moved to?
Speaker 2: Moved to Minneapolis [Minnesota].  While I was in Minneapolis, I was working at the Department of Natural Resources [Minnesota Department of Natural Resources] maybe for a year.  I was a, a--I worked in the Department of Safety [Minnesota Department of Public Safety] and--well, Department of Natural Resources.  What, what I did is I tracked--in, in, in Minnesota, you know, you can see that, you know, it was winter, you know, mostly the snow activities, I would track--which was kind of a morbid job, I would track the accidents.  You know, like people are out on the lake boating, ice fishing.  I would track the accidents of who, who went in the water.  I would track snowmobiling accidents where people hit a barbed wire fence and there's hundreds of, thousands of stitches that they had, so it would be the fatality--actually fatalities and, you know, just the accidents, but that's what I did for a, a little while at the Department of Natural Resources.  Then, I went to Patricia Stevens career schools [Patricia Stevens Career College].  And I went there for fashion merchandising, fashion merchandising.  There was a, a class--there was a class that had fashion drawing, so they said, hm.  So, after I went through that nine month course, I said, hm, you know, we're starting an art and design--you know, commercial art course.  And I said, oh, there comes back my art, you know, that everybody said was fun to do, those fun classes.  So they said, "Well, you know, we're starting this art, commercial art course," and they thought that I would be good at that so, okay, I'll go there.  So, that's where I learned what I do now.  You know, I learned the paste up, the keylining, and all of--all of that, you know, all the layout and design, you know, just how to--well, part of my classes.  You know, there was a lot of classes, but that's where I learned how to do the production and design.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What, what were your parents [Ruth Smith Boyd and Doyle James] feeling about you just moving away from home?
Speaker 2: They didn't know--
Speaker 1: Was this--
Speaker 2: They didn't know where I was (laughter).  I--yeah, I know.  There was a--there was one time, I had--I think I had moved to another state before they even knew where I was, you know.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: So, you--
Speaker 2: I--you know, I, I have a--
Speaker 1: --you left home after high school is what you're saying.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I have a--I had a girlfriend, she said, "Boy, well that was sure courageous of you to leave home at nineteen with a baby."  I said, "Yeah, it was."  I don't know why, I don't know how.  But, you know, when I moved, I moved with girlfriends in Minnesota, you know, and that was my little niche and my circle.  They were really good friends and, you know, haven't seen them a lot lately.  But I know one's in Detroit [Michigan], Laura Johnson [ph.].
Story_ID: 610999
Speaker 1: So in Minnesota after that particular job, what did you do next?
Speaker 2: After I was in Minneapolis [Minnesota]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, I was there--you know in, the time that I was there, I was there for four years.  I was there when Prince was uprising.  You know, he was doing his thing, Apollonia [Apollonia Kotero] and, and Morris Day.  I was also there during the time when Mary Tyler Moore, she was down on the (unclear) court, you know, doing 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show.'  We were upstairs in school looking down and she's down there, they're taping and she's throwing the hat.  You know, she's throwing the hat, you know--you, you know the opening scene of that.  So, that was kind of exciting.  That was my time there, so I remember that.  We're--after that, my--I met my--the guy that just called from Chicago [Illinois], that's my--that's my brother-in-law.  I met him and his brother and his brother.  They were going to school.  They were going to Antioch College [Yellow Springs, Ohio] and he was one of the loves of my life, well, his brother, and he and I had my youngest son [Donald James], the one that just came in here, just--not the oldest one [Lawrence James], but the youngest one.  We had a child and then we moved to Omaha [Nebraska], which was his home, and that's where my youngest son was born.  So, I was in Omaha for several years.  And, of course--I mean, our relationship, it worked out but it didn't work out.  You know, he was, unfortunately one of these people that stayed incarcerated, okay, and so that didn't work out.  I mean, if he had been out, it could have.  You know, but, you know, 'cause he was a smart guy.
Speaker 1: So, how were you dealing with the, the transitions from Grand Rapids [Michigan]--
Speaker 2: Like, like Barack [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] said (brushes off shoulders) (laughter), keep it moving, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and how was Omaha?  Who were some of the people that you met in Omaha?
Speaker 2: Omaha was good because I--who I met in Omaha, Beth Shannon [ph.], and that's another white female.  You know, I, I, I don't know, I have--I have close ties with a lot of--a lot of people, but I always have a special rapport.  We had a business, Salt and Pepper Art Studios [Omaha, Nebraska].  I worked at Omaha National Bank [First National Bank of Omaha, Omaha, Nebraska].  I met her--as a matter of fact, she just sent me an email, a text message, you know, about my mom [Ruth Smith Boyd].  You know, so--because--but she was here.  And I'll, I'll have to pull out the paper.  She came here and we had not seen each other in over twenty years, and we just had a big celebration here.  And we had a business called Salt and Pepper Art Studios.
Story_ID: 611000
Speaker 1: Beth Shannon [ph.] and I worked at Omaha National Bank [First National Bank of Omaha, Omaha, Nebraska] together as chartographers and we just decided that we want to start our own business, and this was really kind of unheard of back at that time.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: As a matter of fact--yes, at, at--and, and--but, we struck out and it was--it was--it was more--it was more fun, but it, it--and, of course, if we--if I hadn't have moved again, we'd probably still be in business or our kids would have the business.  But, I, I, I miss Beth a whole lot.  We, we were--so, we started our business, Salt and Pepper Art Studios [Omaha, Nebraska], and we got our clients.  It was kind of--it was kind of fun.  It was cute because, you know, I, I would go get the black clients and she'd go get the white clients.  You know, that's how we worked it.  But, they teased--what they did is they teased us at Omaha National Bank because they would call us salt and pepper.  You know, and they'd say--but then they--it was--and then it became a joke.  They'd call me salt and say, "Hey, salt, where's pepper?"  You know, and they'd call her and they'd say, "Hey, pepper, where's salt?"  You know, so that was a ongoing joke.  It was an ongoing joke, you know, because we became very good friends.  I watched her kids and I went through her times where she went through a divorce and she had kids and she went through the divorces, you know, mine--my separations and my kids [Lawrence James and Donald James], she was there.  As a matter of fact, I got pictures where she was there with my, my youngest son at the hospital, and when she came here, she said, "Okay, we're gonna recreate this," so he's sitting on her lap taking a picture at my house.  So, that was a good time.  But, she was very special.
Speaker 2: This was about--you worked at the bank--
Speaker 1: Nineteen--
Speaker 2: --from '75 [1975] to '77 [1977]?
Speaker 1: Seventy-five [1975] to '77 [1977]? (Unclear).
Speaker 2: At the bank, at Omaha National Bank.
Speaker 1: Yeah, about--around there.  We started our business in 19--when did we start our business?  Yeah, around there 'cause my youngest son--actually, when we started our business, it was thirty years ago, so it was about nineteen seventy--yeah, about '76 [1976].
Speaker 2: Seventy-seven [1977].
Speaker 1: 'Cause he was--he was actually crawling around on the floor when we were making our brochures, so it was about thirty--about thirty years ago.
Speaker 2: Now, you said a chartographer?
Speaker 1: Chartographer.  That was just--
Speaker 2: Chartographer.
Speaker 1: --a title, you know.
Speaker 2: What did you do?
Speaker 1: Made charts--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --you know, for the bank.  You know, the bank would have charts and it would still be, you know, the slide presentations and those type of things.  So, you know, banks may have something for their meetings and, so we were the in--in house, in house design group.  And then after--yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Now, in the Salt and Pepper Art Studios, what did you do?  Did you--
Speaker 1: We started making--we--designing logos--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --business cards, brochures, menus, anything that needed to be printed, catalogs, souvenir books, you know, things like that.
Speaker 2: And you stayed in business for a couple of years, three--about three (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We did.
Speaker 2: --years or so?
Speaker 1: We did until I moved.
Story_ID: 611001
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what was your next move?
Speaker 2: To Denver [Colorado].  Yeah, to Denver.  Yeah, moved to Denver.  I met--it was my husband, yeah, and moved to Denver.
Speaker 1: And what was his name?
Speaker 2: Leon Harris [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and you met him in--
Speaker 2: Actually, no, I met him in Omaha [Nebraska] because he was there.  He was a singer and he was actually singing--my son's father he was--he sang also.  He was a singer.  Well, yeah, he could sing, but he wasn't a singer like Leon was.  But anyway, so, my son's--my husband actually was in Omaha singing with the group that my husband used to sing with.  I thought, man--oh, god, he's got a great voice and this, that, and the other, so--I don't know.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the group, do you remember?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was--oh, oh, it's on the tip of my tongue.
Speaker 1: You'll think about it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know what, and it just got inducted into the--oh, Showpushers.  They just got inducted into the Omaha hall of fame [Omaha Black Music Hall of Fame, Omaha, Nebraska], the Showpushers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, anyway, I met him and I said, well, time to go, so that brought me to Denver.  And we were married about five or six years, and then I was so involved in the paper [Denver Urban Spectrum], I think--I, I--then, I started my newspaper and, I don't know, I think that might've been a conflict for him and his music and, so it's like, we'll part our ways, but we're very good friends, yeah.
Story_ID: 611002
Speaker 1: At Rees Printing [ph.], did you--you did layout for Rees Printing at a time?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  That was when I first moved here.  I was working for--you know, just working for in house printing company.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Design, you know, getting everything ready to go to press.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what happens when you finish that project, you and your husband [Leon Harris (ph.)] split, and what do you do next?
Speaker 2: Newspaper.  The--I mean, when I started the Urban Spectrum [Denver Urban Spectrum] twenty-one years ago, that was my life, yes.
Speaker 1: The Urban Spectrum.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So this is--and, and how did you decide to start a newspaper?
Speaker 2: Actually, I, I--it wasn't me.  You know, it wasn't my idea, because I--all this time, I was doing freelance artwork.  Everywhere, after I went, after I went to Patricia Stevens school [Patricia Stevens Career College], I could have a space that big wherever that stuff is and I put up a drafting table.  You know, and I'd have my triangles--you know, I'd have a, a workspace.  Wherever it was, I'd have a workspace, you know.  It didn't matter.  I, I could be in a one room apartment, one room, you know, apartment and I'd have one little corner that I had to designate for work.  So, I always did commercial.  You know, I always did advertising, you know, some kind of commercial art, designing brochures.  And even my youngest son, when we lived in an apartment, my youngest son, the, the, the youngest one that came in here--
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: Donald [Donald James].  He was about seven, six, seven years old.  He'd--yeah, I'd always have a copier and a little drafting table.  He'd make some things.  He'd, he'd draw something and then he'd go make copies of it.  He'd go through the apartment complex.  He said, "Would you like to buy this logo?"  He'd come back with five or six dollars in his (laughter)--people would just--you know, he's a--here he is, five or six years old, he said, "Do you wanna buy this logo?"  You know, he knew the lingo and he'd go out and get a quarter.  Somebody'd give him a quarter, somebody may give him a dollar, you know, dollar, dollar twenty-five.  But, he had that entrepreneurial spirit.  You know, I'll talk about him later, too, 'cause he's a caterer.  He's got his own business, but--yeah.
Story_ID: 611003
Speaker 1: So you said it wasn't your idea to start the paper.  Whose was it?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, two people contacted me.  Two people contacted me.  The first guy was Robert Stewart and he called me and he says, "Well, I want to start a newspaper," he said, "but I'm looking for a, a graphic designer and everyone here in Denver [Colorado] is--says, 'Go see Bee [HistoryMaker Rosalind Juanita Harris] here.  She's a graphic designer, go see her.'" Because I was--had done a lot of work for a lot of people, souvenir books for different organizations, designing logos in a--excuse me--in addition to, you know, I was doing some work at the--at RTD [Regional Transportation District, Denver, Colorado].  So, he had asked me, he said that he wanted to start a publication.  I said, "Okay."  I said, "Okay, Robert.  Work on your business plan, come back and see me, you know, okay."  I didn't hear from him anymore.  So then all of a sudden maybe three or four months later, this other guy named Ron Steele [Ron Ira Steele], he contacts me, and he's a photojournalist and I think he's at the Indianapolis Star still.  He says, "I would like to start a newspaper, you know, and I'm looking for a partner, and everyone keeps telling me to go see Bee Harris."  I was like, what is this, you know?
Speaker 1: Well, you had worked for--before you get to Spectrum [Denver Urban Spectrum], the Colorado home and lifestyle magazine [Colorado Homes and Lifestyle].
Speaker 2: Yep, these were just--these--
Speaker 1: So, these were jobs that--
Speaker 2: These were jobs that--
Speaker 1: --helped you--
Speaker 2: --that I was doing layout and design.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I think I was just being prepared.  What else do we have there?  What other jobs?
Speaker 1: DK Associates/Excel Services [ph.].
Speaker 2: Same thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was a--that was a--that was for--that was out at Lowry Air Force Base [Colorado].  I was the in--yeah, I was the in house design person.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So that was from '82 [1982] to '84 [1984]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  These were all--
Speaker 1: So this was all in preparation--
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: --even though you didn't know you wanted to start--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --a, a newspaper.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, did--so, he gets back to you or you just--
Speaker 2: He--the first guy?  No, he didn't get back to me, Robert.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But, Ron Steele, after he said--
Speaker 1: Ron Steele.
Speaker 2: So, I called Robert.  I said, "Hey, Robert, how's the business plan going?"  He said, "What business plan?"  I said, "For the newspaper."  He said, "I forgot all about that," you know.  So, the three of us all get together, Ron, Rosalind, and Robert.  That's why we had R and R Productions [ph.]. That was our company.  We went out and did a little footwork and went out and contacted the printer.  The printer said it's gonna cost eleven hundred dollars to print the paper.  Okay, twelve pages, that's the one I showed you with Oprah [Oprah Winfrey] in, in the inside.  That's when she was just starting out.  We went out and--yeah, eleven hundred dollars to print the paper.  And we said, okay, it's gonna be about twelve pages.  We didn't know what it was.  You know, I just fill to--figure it out.  We're scrambling for articles, scrambling for advertising, went out and got $1102 worth of advertising.  Yeah, okay we can go to press (laughter).  So, we went to press with that first issue and, and, like they say, the rest is history.
Speaker 1: Now, that was in, in--
Speaker 2: In 1987.
Speaker 1: --nineteen eighty-seven [1987].
Speaker 2: March 27th, that was the first issue.  Yeah, we came out as--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a monthly.  And the--we focused--yeah, it started off being kind of a focus--women, focus was on women, but after the first year, said, we're just gonna do it on people of color.
Story_ID: 611004
Speaker 1: So talk to me about some of the articles and some of the people that you featured.  You--when you said you, you started out on women, that--is that why Oprah [Oprah Winfrey] was in the, the first issue [of the Denver Urban Spectrum]?
Speaker 2: Actually, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  It, it just happened that she had came--and this was great because when--I, I got pictures with her from that--from that time, too, the tickets were like--VIP tickets to see Oprah in 1987 was thirty dollars, so we have four VIP tickets, comps, though.  You know, they were even comps, you know, because of the paper.  But, can you imagine VIP tickets for Oprah, now what they would cost (laughter)?
Speaker 1: And she was here for, for what purpose?
Speaker 2: She was here for a women's organization.  She was here speaking at a women's organization and I--yeah.  What was the organization?  Yeah.  But, she was just--you know, she was just starting out.  You know, I think she had--yeah, she was just starting out with her--with her show.
Speaker 1: So, what was everybody's part in, in putting this paper together?
Speaker 2: I was the design person, so I laid it out.  We all were trying to--doing the advertising sales.  Robert--Ron Steele [Ron Ira Steele] was doing the photography because he's a photojournalist.  And then, Robert [Robert Stewart], he was working with the distribution, yeah, working with the writers, too, yeah.  It was small team.  We were just still small for a community newspaper.
Speaker 1: And so you began to write about the community and people of color.  You said--is--was this a, a free magazine?
Speaker 2: It was free.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: It was free.
Speaker 1: --you depended on--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: So, after the first year, you start doing articles about the community.  Why did you think it was important to have a newspaper and especially--you wanted to get the word out, that's why it was free, about the community.  What was the passion behind that?
Speaker 2: Okay.  You know, I think the, the passion was--came from the community.  Even after we were in our infancy stages of only a, a year and two months, we had a fire at our building.  We had a fire and--
Speaker 1: What was the location?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: We were right kitty corner, not--only at--we were at 17 and East 25th Avenue, which is not even two blocks away, and I could even show you the building (laughter).  But, we had a--we had a fire in our building, and this--we were really young and it's--all of a sudden it's like, you know, the phones were ringing, the phones were ringing, you know, and I couldn't even pick up the phones.  It's like--you know, it was New Year's Eve.  It was just really traumatic.  My business partner at the time, his name was Peter Christy, this white guy who had--who had put money--you know, he had been to Taiwan working and saving his money.  We, we weren't making any money.  He was putting all of his money to keep the business afloat, Peter Christy.  And his wife was from Taiwan and he had just had money that he was putting in, you know, just to keep it afloat.  He hears about the fire while he's up in Boulder [Colorado] 'cause he was living in Boulder.  "Bee [HistoryMaker Rosalind Juanita Harris], what's going on?"  You know, he hears about this fire.  But, the community rallied.  They rallied.  You know, and I pick up the phone and, you know, and I--you know, and I check my messages.  You have fifty messages.  You have this, you know, and you have that.  And it's like--so it was the passion of the community.  They wanted our publication.  Not to say that we didn't have the other ones because there were--there was another community newspaper that's here and they've been around for a long time.  Even Cosmo Harris [Freeman "Cosmo" Harris] who was the owner of the Denver Weekly News, he called me and he says, "You can come over to our facilities, you know, come over here and work," you know.  Then, there was Sharon Silvas from the Colorado Woman News, she said, "If you need anything, come over to our facilities and work," you know.  So then, of course, you know, the big one was when the printer said, hey, just get out there and get advertising, put your paper together, and we'll print it for free, you know, to get you back up on your feet.  And, and that's what happened.  So I said, okay.  I said, we--here we go.  And so we combined our January and February issue.  You know, it was the only time out of the twenty-one years that we--well, just recently, we combined one because we were gearing up for our twentieth anniversary, but we combined our January and February issue and came out in February for black history month.
Story_ID: 611005
Speaker 1: You know, and we--all--you know, since then and up until now and always, we've just had freelance writers, you know, that have been dedicated.  You know, they'll do their stories.  It's, it's--we've had a pool of writers.  They could be--they don't write every month, you know.  Some of them write, some of them write--a couple of them may right every month, but I've seen so many freelance writers, so many freelance writers.  We've had photographers.  We've had--I've had different editors.  I've had different sales people.  I've had--my son [Lawrence James], he was doing distribution I think before he could even drive.  I mean, he's--let's see, he was just barely old enough to drive doing distribution.  And, and he's been--he's the distribution manager now and also my general manager, but as far as the makeup, everyone's like independent contractors.  So, the paper [Denver Urban Spectrum] grew, been well received.  I sat on numerous, numerous, numerous boards.  I sat on the chamber board many years ago when it first was established, and I just got an award just last week from the chamber, so it's like, that was great.  And I, I was real pleased to get an award from the black chamber [Colorado Black Chamber of Commerce].  I got--I've gotten lots of awards from, you know, a lot of places.  But--you know, and it's not awards for me, but it's awards for the paper you know.  Because when we--you know, even when I would work out of my home and people were trying to get stuff in the paper and all of a sudden four o'clock in the morning, they know we're at deadline and I look over and I got a fax coming in, urgent.  They want to get it in because, you know, we're a monthly.  It's like, okay, you know.  But, I think because there's just a--you know, it was a need.  It was a need for our publication.  We focused on a lot for African--the communities of color.  You know, like, Black History Month, what we do for Black History Month which is always a fun issue, we highlight--you know, we feature somebody on the cover.  We have a Black History Month event.  In that issue also, though, in that issue also, we have something for the kids.  We have Color Me Proud.  You know, if somebody's been really instrumental and really wonderful for the last year, it's a caricature of Color Me Proud.  And we have McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation], we have a couple other sponsors that will sponsor, so kids don't--the kids color it for twelve and under and, you know, they'll bring their drawing in over the--you know, after the close of the deadline.  They get a gift bag and it may have a coloring book in it, it may have McDonald's gift certificates, it may have some bottle of water in there from Deep Rock [Deep Rock Water Company], it may have movie passes, it may have something from the Denver Art Museum [Denver, Colorado], you know, things like that.  And, so another thing that we do also in black--you know, during black history month is we have--we nominate--we have people nominated, African Americans who make a difference.  And we solicit that starting in December.  So, this issue that we've got--we're gonna work on, we're going to send out an ad, a call for our African, African Americans who make a difference for two--2009.  So, the community will send questionnaires in and--well, they'll send nominations in.  We'll send them out a questionnaire, they send it back, and then we select from that pool, you know, from--based on their responses.  And so that's a--you know, so that's another feature that we have for Black History Month.  Another one that we include in there, like to include in there.  The African American leadership institute, they have a class.  And we'll usually--we'll poll a--we'll poll them on a question.  Of course, this one's got to be on, you know, Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] (laughter).  But, you know, that would be probably in February, you know--you know, because he'll be in office, you know, by then and, you know, there'll be some time for us to give some thought on, you know, the--how effective you think he'll be.  I don't even know what the question might be.  But, of course, I think it will probably be, you know, on Barack Obama.  But, what else do we have Black History Month?  And like I say, we do have an event where we recognize--we recognize African Americans that make a difference and we also honor the person who was featured on the cover.  Some of the people that we featured on the cover, of course, has been the Webbs.  We've had Michael Hancock, city councilman and [HistoryMaker] Elbra Wedgeworth.  You, you had interviewed Opalanga [HistoryMaker Opalanga D. Pugh].  Opalanga was on our third cover twenty years ago, third or fourth cover, twenty years ago.  We've had [HistoryMaker] Cleo Parker Robinson, you know, featured on the cover.  But, the black history--and then sometimes we'll just feature business people, you know, like Carl Bourgeois and Sheila King.  Those are another--that's another great couple that you could--for HistoryMaker [The HistoryMakers].  Let's see, did we have--I know you did [HistoryMaker] Paul Stewart, yeah.
Speaker 2: We're gonna do (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Are you doing him tomorrow?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 611006
Speaker 1: Tell me why your paper is different from the other papers that you mentioned before.
Speaker 2: I think our paper is a little bit different, because--well, besides that we're a monthly and the, the layout of the paper, I think our stories are a little bit different.  We, we, we do a little bit more in depth stories, profiles, and I think we do cover--by us being monthly, we have a little bit more time to focus on things that, that are interest--that are the interest of the community.  Not to say that the Denver Weekly News is not.  They are.  And I think they do a phenomenal job, you know.  I think they cover so much, you know, each week.  You know, they cover a lot.  But I think that ours is more like a magazine format.  You know, it's more like a magazine format.  Because you can pick up a Spectrum [Denver Urban Spectrum] now and you can read something about it and then it's more information on inform, enlighten, inspire.  You know, these are stories that, you know, even--you know, 'cause we can't scoop anybody, you know.  It's like right now, you know, we can't scoop--you know, oh, Barack [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] is the president.  Oh, duh, who didn't know that, you know, when we come out in December.  But, you know, we want to make it a little bit different.  We wanted to make it to be a collectives--you know, a collectable, you know, something that people will really, really, really want to keep, you know.  So, that's basically why I think the Spectrum is a little bit different than the other community newspapers.
Story_ID: 611007
Speaker 1: What is new--we--you were just telling us the difference between your paper [Denver Urban Spectrum] and the other papers.  Technology, how has technology influenced your paper?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Technology, it hasn't influenced it and affected it a whole lot.  Everything is, you know, so much is going web, Internet, you know, web based, Internet based, so we have revamped--it's still a--almost still a work in progress, but we have revamped our website.  You know, 'cause a lot of people are asking for, you know, advertising rates for on the web.  And we--we're still working on it to provide, you know, to provide that avenue.  Because a lot of people--and our advertising is still okay, but it's not--you know, it could be a lot better than it was.  I think since those last eight years and since 9/11 [September 11, 2001], you know, it--you know, every--it--sometimes I'd say, oh, god, it's gonna get--it's gonna get better a little bit and then all of a sudden it's like, okay, you know.  Seems like things are picking up and it's like, okay, you know.  Here we go again, okay.  You know, it's, it's, it's been, you know, ups and downs, you know, ups and downs for so many years.  So, you know, of course, we gotta go, you know, other avenues to, you know, make sure that it stays afloat and, you know, just go with the change and go with the times.  And I, I--and I see that, you know, and I saw that with--you know, with the--with this campaign, you know, I mean, the Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] campaign.  Because, you know, everybody is text messaging and everything is by email, you know, so, you know, it's just a matter of staying with the times, you know.  But that has--you know, but the Internet has--but it's good because we're global.  You know, we're more global, so it, it has its advantages.  It has--you know, and, and the other thing, though, it could have a disadvantage.  We have focus groups trying to say, "Well, what are we gonna do?  How are we gonna do this?"  Everyone said, "We still have to--we still have to--we still have to keep the paper."  Because, you know, it's a community paper.  You know, it's a community paper.  People come by--you know, it's kind of nice when people come by and they want to grab the paper.  You know, 'cause there's a lot of older people who don't have Internet, so we still have to make that available for the people who cannot--you know, who are not on the Internet.  So, we said, well, we just gotta work on, you know, having them--having the--keeping them both because there are some publications that have gone strictly, you know, Internet, and I don't think we could do that, not for a long--not, not for a while.  You know, and I don't think we'll--may not ever do it.  We may, you know, downscale, you know, maybe something if we need to do that, but, you know, it--we're a community newspaper.  You know, if nothing else, you know, people want to pick up the paper and see what's going on in Denver [Colorado], and we are--we are a great resource.
Speaker 1: And you talked about it being magazine style and so the paper is in color?
Speaker 2: It's in color, uh-huh.  It's in color.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not, not, not every page color.  You know, we have sections that are in color.  You know, there are certain pages in color.  But, I say it's a magazine format only because it's trimmed and stapled.  You know, it's not a tabloid, but, you know, it is trimmed and stapled, so that's kind of the format.  We say it's a magaloid format, yeah.
Story_ID: 611008
Speaker 1: And now, tell me how else the paper is involved in the community.  I know you established a, a foundation?
Speaker 2: We have Urban Spectrum Youth Foundation [Denver, Colorado].  We did not run the program last summer.  Funding was cut back from the city and we did not get our usual funding and that just taught me that I can't depend on, you know, just one source to support, you know, a program.  So, our, our program's journalism program, it started out when [HistoryMaker] Wellington Webb in the summer of violence in 1993 when it was truly a summer of violence, and that's when the gangs were uprising.  They--the gangs were, you know, just out of hand here in Denver, Colorado.  My girlfriend's son was six years old.  As a matter of fact, I was actually dating her--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: During that time, that's when the, the Crips and the Bloods were really rampant in Denver and my girlfriend's son who's six years old, he got shot.  Right now, he is--let's see, that's 1993, so he--right now, he's married--I mean, he's not married, but he's grown with two kids, but he still has the bullet in his head since he was six years old.  He's still has, you know, limited mobility on one side of him.  So, I'm losing my train of thought of what point I was making.  Oh, for the summer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Summer youth program.
Speaker 2: --youth program, okay.  And what the city did was they established a--the sum- Safe City program [Denver Safe City], and they had--I don't remember if it was a million dollars set aside for summer programs, and so we applied for that.  And we--you know--you know, a lot of people applied for it, so everyone got, you know, a little bit of what--you know, what they, you know, offered--you know, what they granted out to, you know, specific organizations.  And so we had our program.  I think we've probably had close to a hundred and, I don't know, 150 maybe close to two hundred kids go through the program since that time.  One of the--one of the young ladies, she's--she was twelve years old in the program.  She just graduated from the Denver School of the Arts [Denver, Colorado] and we just featured her in the last issue because she just graduated and she does photography.  As a matter of fact, I had her do a photo shoot the other day with Mark Udall and he's running for the [U.S.] Senate.  And so she's riding on the bus, big bus with Mark Udall, taking pictures.  So, it's a good program.  Last year, even though we did not have the funding, it was a busy time.  You know, it was a busy time.  We were working, you know, doing as much as we can working on the campaign.  It was probably more beneficial for us not to do the program but, you know, we planned on having it for the summer.  We, we would have anywhere from ten to, at one time, we had twenty-one kids in the program.  And they would come Tuesdays and Thursdays.  They would learn everything about how to put together a newspaper.  They--you know, the--our contributors from the Spectrum [Denver Urban Spectrum], photographers, writers, editors, sales.  We'd have classes just like, you know, we'd have classes, you know, for the Spectrum.  They would learn how to write stories.  They would--we'd--they'd go out into Five Points [Denver, Colorado] and learn how to photography, take pictures.  They'd go out and get--solicit advertising from the businesses here.  They'd have their t-shirts.  But they would be there Tuesday and Thursday for seven to eight weeks, seven weeks.  Within that time, they would do everything to get a paper printed.  So, they raised their--they'd get commission.  Besides getting a stipend from the program, sales if they sold ads, they would still get commission.  So, some of them, if the stipend was at $150 or $100, some of them still can come out with $300, you know, at the end of the school year so they can go get school clothes or whatever else they needed.  So, there were some hustlers in there (laughter).  Like I said, they would sell the ads.  Yeah, so it--it's, it's a very viable and good program.
Speaker 1: Were any of the, the kids involved in gangs a part of this program?
Speaker 2: You know, it started out where we wanted to get inner city kids, but it didn't matter.  You know, they came from all over.  Our--and our kids, they, they weren't--there was one situation where one little girl stole some money and actually she stole it out of my purse, yeah.  And we had to let her go out of the program.  But, I don't think there--you know, there was a few of the girls--you know, there were a few of the girls, they weren't really involved in gangs but they were a little hardcore, then there was a few of the hardcore.  They'd fight, you know.  But, but for the most part, all the kids that went through the program were well respected, smart, and everything.
Story_ID: 611009
Speaker 1: So what's next for, for your paper [Denver Urban Spectrum]?  You just moved to a new facility here--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and how are you--I mean, it's not very far from where you used to be.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: But, how's the community feeling even about--and, and yourself about even this small move down the street?
Speaker 2: Oh, they're glad that this is the main block, you know, this is the historic spot of, of Denver, of--I mean, of Five Points [Denver, Colorado].  As a matter of fact, and I didn't even know this, I have a, a, a--and he's my son's friend.  He's from Senegal and I know his mom from Dakar from Senegal, West Africa.  He came over here when we were moving in and painting and he says, "You know, this is where the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] used to meet, right here in this building."  I was like, "You're telling me something I didn't even know."  He says, "Yeah, this was the Black Panthers--you know, this is where they used to meet."  And I said, "Oh, very good."  You know, so it was good to know that.  I'm living in a little bit of history here and I wanted to do a little research before you got here and say, yeah, they did used to meet here 'cause I knew some of the--you know, Hiawatha Davis [Hiawatha Davis, Jr.], he was part of the Black Panthers.  But, you know, I said, hm, that's a good feeling.  You know, that's a good feeling, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, were you--well, I guess you weren't old enough to have experienced--
Speaker 2: I'm older than you think.  No (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) No, but to experience Five Points being a very--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --vibrant time.
Speaker 2: No.  No.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I wish--you know, and, and I wish--I wished that I--well, I kind of wish that I would have.  You know, people like Charlie Cousins [Charles Cousins] would know.  But, yeah--but, you know, you hear the stories and I keep saying--I said, boy, I said, if I was back in that time, I said, me and Billie Holiday would've been good friends, you know.  That's the one that I--I said me and Billie, we would've hung out, you know (laughter).
Story_ID: 611010
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, one thing I wanted to ask you is how did you get the name or the nickname of Bee [HistoryMaker Rosalind Juanita Harris]?
Speaker 2: A couple of different ways.  I had heard that--I had heard that--I came in the house one day and I kept--you know, they said I got stung by a bee, "Bee, bee, bee, bee," you know, so with that.  Then, I heard that--but I think the original is that because my brothers and sisters could not pronounce my name, Rosalind, they called me baby.  So, it went from baby to Bee Bee to Bee.  As a matter of fact, people at, at home may still call me Bee Bee, you know, they still call me Bee Bee.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And then--let's see, if someone calls me now and they'll call me on the phone, they say, "Can I speak to Bee Bee?"  I say, "Who's this from Grand Rapids [Michigan]?"  You know, because that's what it is, but, but that's how--that's how it came about.
Story_ID: 611011
Speaker 1: And you told me you wanted to tell me about your sons.
Speaker 2: They're my hearts (laughter).  My oldest son, the one that keep walking in and out and he's a, a like--
Speaker 1: What's his--
Speaker 2: He's--
Speaker 1: What--which--what is his name?
Speaker 2: Lawrence James.  He's like my rock.  He's my rock.  He's been here with this paper [Denver Urban Spectrum], ups and downs and everything.  You know, whatever needs to be done, he's there.  He--you know, he works at another part-time job also, but he's almost--he's thirty-nine, will be forty in, in March.  He's not married, doesn't have any kids.  He's a great uncle.  Yeah, he's not married.  But--what else can I say about him?  What else can I say about him?  Yeah.  He loves his mom, he loves his brother, loves his nieces, loves his family, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your other son?
Speaker 2: My youngest son, Donald [Donald James], he's thirty-one.  He's got his own catering business.  He also works somewhere else but, you know, he's got his catering business called Stick It To Me chicken--well, Stick It To Me, Stick It To Me Catering [Denver, Colorado], but they, they specialize in skewered foods.  So, he could have Stick It To Me chicken, Stick It To Me beef, Stick It To Me fruit, Stick It To Me, you know, he--you know, that's, that's the--that's his specialty.  He has two sons, and he's not married.  They're not married now, neither one.
Speaker 1: What are your grandsons named?
Speaker 2: Donald and Tyrell.  I mean Tyrell--I'm sorry, Tyrell [Tyrell James (ph.)] and Dillon [Dillon James (ph.)].  I wanted to talk about my oldest grandson.  He's just amazing 'cause my girlfriend, she says, you know he's been here before.  You know, they had--they were--play football.  They're actually cousins to Chauncey Billups, you know, the, the--you know, the--you, you familiar with Chauncey?  Basketball player?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Maybe he knows but (laughter)--but anyway, he was the MVP [Most Valuable Player] a couple of years ago and he's from Denver [Colorado].  He just got traded back to Detroit--I mean, to Denver [Denver Nuggets] from the Detroit Pistons.  Ivan--Iverson, Allen Iverson, they're kind of switching them around.  But anyway, Tyrell, he's ten years old and he--he's got--he's supposed to have--he wanted to go to Michigan, you know, for his great-grandma's [Ruth Smith Boyd] funeral.  He called me the other morning, he says, "Grandma," he said, "how you doing?"  I said, "Okay."  He said, "I can't believe Big Ma passed," and I said, "Yeah."  And so he says--so he says, "Yeah."  He said, "But you doing okay?"  And I says, "Yeah, I'm doing okay."  He says, well--and he said he wanted to go to the funeral and I said, "Okay, let me check with your mom."  So, now, see the funeral is on Saturday and she says, "Well, he's got his Super Bowl game.  He might not want to go."  I mean, she said, "We'll have to see what he wants to do."  She said, "Well, I think he wants to go with you," just like that, you know.  And I said, "Well, you know, that's up to his deci- it's up to his choice."  And so, then anyway, he calls--she said he wants to do his Super Bowl.  I said, "That's not a problem."  She said--so, he calls me from school and he said--he says, "Grandma, I got Super Bowl."  And I said, "Yeah, Ty."  I said, "You, you need to go to your Super Bowl game."  And he said, "Okay."  I said, "Just make sure you get a foot- just make sure you get a touchdown for Big Ma."  He said, "Okay."  He said, but, "You know what I want--I want--Grandma, I want you to take a picture of him--of, of Big Ma.  I want you to take a picture of her in her casket."  And I said, "You do?"  He says, "Yeah."  You know, he said, "And we're gonna stop by there 'cause I'm gonna bring something.  I want you to put--I want you to put something in her casket for me."  And I said, "Okay, Ty."  So, last night, we're at the--you know, at the watch party at Shadow Theatre [Aurora, Colorado] and he comes in and he gives me three index cards.  He had a blue--he had one written out in blue, one written out--two written out in, in, you know, black ink.  He said, "Okay, I want you to read this one to the family and you put these two in the casket," and I said, "Okay."  The one for the family is a--is a scripture on stress and I'll share those with you.  The one he wanted me to put in the casket was one on prayer and one on death.  But, you know, that's what he gave me.  That's what he gave me.  And his mom just said, okay.  He's ten years old.  He amazes me, you know, all the time.  And I--my girlfriend says well, you know, he's been here before.  He's some special kid.  Yeah.  But, I don't know.  I don't know.  He pulled--he pulled those three out.  And then he said, you can just read them all to the family, you know, so.
Speaker 1: And so I know as, as grandma, you will do just as he says (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep, um-hm (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 611012
Speaker 1: You just mentioned the, the Shadow Theatre [Aurora, Colorado].  What is your affiliation with that?
Speaker 2: I sit on the advisory board for Shadow Theatre.
Speaker 1: What, what is Shadow Theatre?
Speaker 2: It's a black owned theater company.  They just had a run of a theater called 'Joe Turner's Come and Gone' and they do a lot of August Wilson, Jeffrey Nickelson, another history maker.  I could give you a list of people.  But, Jeffrey Nickelson, he's the artistic director and he just got a new facility, you know, there in Denver, Colorado--I mean, there in Aurora [Colorado], yeah.  But he just got this great--you know, great building, beautiful.  And it was a great turnout last night for the watch party, um-hm.
Story_ID: 611013
Speaker 1: And has your, your paper followed Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama]?  I--tell me about how you accumulated--did you accumulate articles or did you write--many articles that you put together in, in your book--
Speaker 2: What--
Speaker 1: --the Obama book ['Barack Obama: Making History'].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  What we did--
Speaker 1: Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What we did--I mean, we have been following it, you know, and I think Barack's been on about three--you know, in some kind of way three, three covers, you know, within the last four or five months, and I'll make sure I give you some of those copies.  But we follow him.  We've had some writers, you know, write articles.  But, of course, you know, we just got inundated with, you know, un- unsolicited articles.  We got, you know, articles from columnists, you know, just--you know, just a whole barrage of everything that's been going on.  You know, we just got articles after articles after articles.  So, it wasn't that, you know, it wasn't that difficult.  But, as far as the book, the Obama book, that came about because we were doing a jazz and blues festival [After Five Denver Jazz and Blues Festival 2008] during the DNC [2008 Democratic National Convention, Denver, Colorado].  I, I was part of that committee.  So, we were going to work on a souvenir book, but this, this company out of Atlanta [Georgia] did the souvenir book and I chose to do a commemorative book on Barack Obama, so there wouldn't--you know, there was no conflict or anything.  That book was--some of the stories that we had previously did in the--in the--in the Spectrum [Denver Urban Spectrum].  So, we did a story, a profile on him.  We also did--we were able to get an interview and it was all by email, but we sent questions to both of them.  So, we got one on one interview with Barack and Michelle [Michelle Obama].  We also included information about the DNC because the DNC was held here one hundred years ago.  So, we had a DNC story one hundred years ago and today.  We also did a piece on--oh, what's--I can't even think of her name.  She was the, the chair of the, the convention.
Speaker 1: Elbra [HistoryMaker Elbra Wedgeworth]?
Speaker 2: Nope.  No.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Elbra brought it.  Elbra brought it here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, oh shoot.  Anyway, I should pull it out.  I don't want to not have this on here without me saying her name.  She's a pastor, African American.  Boy, we need to grab that book over there.  Can you grab it?
Speaker 1: Okay.  One second.
Speaker 2: It's just over there.  It's just one of those books.
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Okay.  We did a profile on Leah Daughtry.  She was the CEO of the DNC, African American woman, and a minister, so that was a historical story on her.  We also featured--we had that in, in a previous article--previous issue of the Spectrum and we also did a story on people of color delegates, and that was a previous article that was in the--in the--in the Spectrum.  So, that's how we came up with, with this--with the concept of the book.  And then, we had some people who--you know, we just solicited to ask people if they wanted to congratulate Obama.  Forest Whitaker because he had been here and had traveled with him, campaigned for him.  He said, "Oh, full page."  He wanted me to put a full page in there for him.  So, some of the businesses around Denver [Colorado], they wanted to support, so that's how we got it done and, and got it out there and got it paid for and printed.  And now we're still--that's available for promotion and, you know, for sale.  Yeah but--and Barack signed three of them for me, so that was, that was exciting.
Story_ID: 611014
Speaker 1: Did you have an opportunity to meet and speak with him [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama]?
Speaker 2: I met and spoke with him, yeah, on March 2007.  And he was here in--he was here in Colorado.  And there's a page in the book ['Barack Obama: Making History'] that has a lot of pictures with him with people from Colorado.  So, he spent--yeah, when he came here, he was downtown.  Boy, so many people.  I mean, just the onset of that one was phenomenal.  They were all outside of the building and he was, you know, just here visiting.  This was way be--this was before he announced he was running for presidency.  So I met him, and I was more excited talking to him, took pictures and not knowing that this was going to be the--our next president, yeah.  And, and then, you know, I've, I've followed, you know, his times that he's been here.  I've probably seen him, let's see, probably four times and I didn't talk to him all those times, but the most recent, he was here in--when he was in Golden, Colorado, and I was right there in front, so that's when he signed the book and he shook my hand.  So, that was--that was a special treat.  We went to Cheyenne [Cheyenne County, Colorado], Colorado Springs [Colorado], so, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he did--
Speaker 2: --it was great.  It was great.
Speaker 1: --a great job.
Speaker 2: And then I was fortunate, you know, just last--Michelle [Michelle Obama] was just here.  Her last, her last rally was here in--was here in Colorado on Monday, on Monday, yeah.  She's phenomenal.
Story_ID: 611015
Speaker 1: So these are really great stories in this past year, but over the twenty years, what are some of the great stories that you think, that are most memorable to you in these past twenty years?
Speaker 2: I think--I mean, me personally, just meeting people, I--you know, 'cause I--I'd, I'd have to look back and think about all the wonderful stories that the writers have contributed, but I think one of the benefits of the spectrum is that I've met so many people.  I've met [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis.  I've met Johnnie Cochran.  I've met Oprah [Oprah Winfrey], you know, and went to her show--went to her show.  I've met Oprah like on three occasions.  I met [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou.  I've met Cicely Tyson.  Let me think.  I mean, besides that, there's lots of comedians, you know.  I mean, you know--you know, there's lots of comedians that come through.  I mean, [HistoryMaker] Cedric The Entertainer.  You know, there's a lot--entertainers are wonderful.  I met [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson.  I've met Desmond Tutu.
Story_ID: 611016
Speaker 1: My travels, one of the things that, that has been wonderful for my publication as I did have the opportunity, I traveled as the journalist when Mayor Webb [HistoryMaker Wellington Webb] took a, a team, a delegation to Senegal--his, his--the delegation--is mission to West Africa, mission to West Africa.  And I, I--and I, I probably skipped over another small portion in my life.  I did marry--I was married to a wonderful man from Senegal, yes.  So I went to (laughter)--
Speaker 2: What year was this?
Speaker 1: That was--we got married in--I met him in 1999 because that was my first trip.  He was actually the security.  He was part of our security--part of the security team, the, the--yeah, the--actually, the security team for the delegation.  I met him in 1999.  We got married in 2001, a week after 9/11 [September 11, 2001].  And then he came here in beginning of 2002 and we were married for--until 2005, yeah.  Yeah, but he's from Senegal.  But, what I was saying is that when I was privileged to and honored to go to Africa two times with Mayor Webb, the first time, I was a working journalist and it was--
Speaker 2: What year was it?
Speaker 1: That was 1999.  That was--
Speaker 2: Okay, that wasn--
Speaker 1: --the first time I went.
Speaker 2: That was your first time.
Speaker 1: That was the first time.
Speaker 2: And what was that experience like?
Speaker 1: Oh, it was wonderful.  He had--he had--he selected ten mayors from across the country to go.  What he was doing is building ties, you know, with the mayors.  He was a mayor, so he was building ties with mayors from, you know, in Africa.  Yeah, we went to--we went to Senegal and went to Ghana.  We were scheduled to go to Nigeria, but it was an unrestful time, so we passed on that, we stayed a little bit, a little bit longer in Senegal and had a couple more days in Ghana, which was of benefit to me because I met my husband (laughter), so that was good.
Speaker 2: You said it was ten mayors, ten mayors from--
Speaker 1: Ten mayors.
Speaker 2: --from--
Speaker 1: From--
Speaker 2: --the United States?
Speaker 1: From the United States, yes.
Speaker 2: Do you remember which mayors they were?
Speaker 1: Oh, they--oh, there's Mayor Pasquel--Pasquale [ph.], he was from Ohio.  He was white.  They weren't all black either.  You know, they weren't all black.  There was Sharpe James, you know, from New Jersey.  Yeah, Sharpe James.  Donald--let's see, there were several mayors, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Mayor--oh, shoot, from East Point, Georgia.  She's Asa Hilliard's [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III]--[HistoryMaker] Patsy Jo Hilliard, and she's originally--she's from Denver [Colorado].  Then there was another one, Mayor--Mayor Marilyn Murrell, Mayor Marilyn Morrell.  She had a small city [Arcadia, Oklahoma].  She only had about six hundred people I think she was the mayor of.  I remember it was a small city, maybe even three hundred.  But--and, you know, there's still--I mean, even after all these years, I still send them a newspaper every month, you know, so they can see what's going on in Denver, you know.  Asa Hilliard, you know, he just recently died, so that was Patsy Jo's husband, and so--but it was great because we were treated like royalty.  It was so much fun.  I said, boy, maybe I'll be seen on CNN, you know (laughter).  And it was pretty cool because you go in--you know, certain places we'd go in and they'd have the guards there and you're walking through and it's like, you know.  But it was fun.  I mean, we did have our--the Spectrum [Denver Urban Spectrum] has been--afforded some great opportunities.  And we've got a lot of friends and a lot of support.
Speaker 2: What did you learn while you were there?  Was there something specific that you remember about that trip besides--
Speaker 1: I've learned--
Speaker 2: --meeting your husband (laughter)?
Speaker 1: I've learned that--yeah.  (Laughter) I've learned that, you know, some of the--you know, and I think the focus is on--the key is in the youth.  You know, I think that kids here don't understand how well they have it, and that's such a struggle, such a struggle in Africa for our kids.  And, you know, I'm involved in another organization called the Colorado-Ghana Children's Fund, and it's a grassroots organization where we raise money to get street kids off of the street.  But, you know, when, when you're--when you're out in Africa, certain parts of Africa and you see so many people, you know, but then they may not have any shoes and, you know, you're driving down the street and all of the sudden they're trying to sell you a roll of toilet paper or sell--wash your windows really quick to make some money, you know, they'll wash your windows and, you know, want money.  They'll be selling anything on the street, anything, cell phone covers.  I just think that, you know, kids in America, you know, they take things for granted.  And I have four kids that I claim in Ghana, and I haven't seen them in a long time, but we communicate and--you know, through email, and whenever I can, I want to send them some money.  You know, they're, they're grown now.  I mean, they tell me now, "Mom, we're not--I'm not a--I'm not a young--," he said, "I'm not a boy anymore, I'm a young man."  You know, and after you're seventeen and twenty-seven, I know you are.  You know, I know you are and it's still the same old story.  It's the same story.  It's been--it's just difficult for them.  It's very difficult.

Speaker 1: --Concern for the African American community?
Speaker 2: I think to find some common ground and some understanding and to support our youth, and mostly try to understand them.  I think they can't support them until they understand them.  I still think there's a--I think there's a disconnect between our youth and some of the, the--you know, the adults, and I think it's a generational gap.  I'm totally, you know, don't understand them myself.  But, I think that--and I have to just go back to Barack [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama].  Because, you know, I think this I just a historic time and I think that this change and I--in my heart, I think he's gonna bring some change about, you know, this world, all around, you know, the whole world.  I was watching how P. Diddy [Sean Combs] was talking about how he was getting people out to vote and, you know, just, just how he's mobilized young people, older people, black people, white people, Latinos, rich, poor.  You know, he's just mobilized them and I think--you know, I think that this world would've been devastated if he had not gotten office.  You know, I--it, it--I think it would've been a total uproar, but I don't--you know, but I think he was blessed and I think that this was just his time.  And one of the things that Bill Cobbs, the actor Bill Cobbs, he--you know, you see what he said in the book ['Barack Obama: Making History'] that I produced.  He said, and I'm not quite sure of the quote, but it was something that's like when your time comes, you know, when there--you know, I, I probably need to just read it, but in a sense--when he said this.  When he told me this quote and it was perfect, and it made so much sense.  He says, "Nothing can stop an idea whose time has come."  You know, and that was a Hindu way of life.  And I've--you know, and he said that, no matter what Barack has gone through--you know, I mean, he's--you know, I think he's overcome everything that, you know, was brought forth to him.  You know, they put this out and put this out and looked to the bitter end.  And even talking about his aunt [Zeituni Onyango] that was living here illegally the day before and bringing up, you know, the--but, I just think that, you know, right now is a, a great time and it's gonna be a great time just for the world.  I won't just say just for African Americans because everybody wanted change and I think we--I think it's coming and I think it's gonna be important for everybody to join in and, and, and work with him and share with him, and share him.  He's just not our--he's just not our president.  You know, I say he's the world's president.  You know, he's got--you know, his family in Kenya.  You know, he's got support all over the world, so.
Story_ID: 611018
Speaker 1: When you look back over your life--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --is there anything that you would do differently or that you would change?
Speaker 2: You know, I think I probably would have--I think I--well, you know, I hate to say that I would change but, you know, I think I probably would have wanted to be a little bit more forceful with my education, even with my sons' education.  My youngest son, you know, he was a great soccer player.  He was a great soccer player.  And when he--you know, there were a couple of people, you know, couple colleges, they--they'd come around like--they'd come around and sneak up behind me and say, "Can I speak to you about number one?"  It's like, "Well, number one has a name."  You know, they, they were scouts.  And, you know, he probably--I, I wish I had encouraged him to go to college that wanted, wanted him.  You know, but, you know, that would've been on a soccer--on a soccer tournament.  He wanted to go to Bethune-Cookman [Bethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida].  He went for one year, you know.  He said, "Mom, just let me do this."  I said, okay.  He went to Bethune-Cookman.  He only went the one year, though.  But, you know, I'd call him and he'd say--he'd say--they'd say, "Well what's Donald [Donald James] doing?"  He's in the hallway kicking the soccer ball.  They didn't have the soccer--they didn't have a soccer program.  So--and my oldest son [Lawrence James].  I had a girlfriend, you know, she was on the very first cover of the Spectrum [Denver Urban Spectrum].  She had a great--you know, she had a great business, oh--yeah, and that same Spectrum.
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Her name is Sandra Bice.  But, you know, she was a--she was a, a government contractor.  So, she says, "What's your son doing?"  So, she had a job for him at a very young age.  So he was making money, so he didn't go to school.  You know, he didn't go to school.  But, you know--but, I guess, you know, this is what was supposed to happen.  I'm here where I am in spite of not getting a degree.  My son, in spite of not, you know, getting that soccer tournament, he's doing what he is enjoying doing.  In spite of, you know, my son not going, he's doing what, you know, what he enjoys doing.  But I think in, you know, in the long run and at the--at the end of the day, you know, we're still going to provide this opportunity.  My opportunity is to make it better for both of my sons and my grandsons, you know.  My--I think my--and I think my youngest son realized that, you know, he may not be a, a, a soccer--you know, he may have not become a soccer player, but right now, he's, he's still--this summer, he was out playing soccer.  But his sons are athletes, you know.  So, you know, they may, you know--you know, it's the opportunity for them.  My seven year old grandson that I didn't talk too much about, Dillon [Dillon James (ph.)], he made three touchdowns at his last game.  You know, he's only seven years old.  But, you know, they're athletes.  And so, I think at the end of the day, everyone--you know, you're accountable for whatever you do and you really shouldn't regret what you do, you know.  So I--so I don't, you know.  But, you know, there are some things that maybe, you know, maybe, you know, I, I--maybe I would've changed, but right now, I'm, I'm enjoying my life.

Speaker 1: What is next for you?
Speaker 2: Actually what's next for me is, you know, because of this book ['Barack Obama: Making History'] right here, I am in the process of developing a publishing company with one of the--with the--persons featured in there, [HistoryMaker] Ed Dwight, and I think he's been featured in HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's been featured.  And he's a very good friend and love his energy.  He's working on a lot of projects.  As a matter of fact, we featured him on the cover of the Spectrum [Denver Urban Spectrum] this month.  But, a publishing company.  And because he's got a wealth of information, a wealth of projects, you know, things that he needs published, and they're not--he doesn't have them (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Are they books and--
Speaker 2: Books, you know--you know, pieces of his art.  You know, I mean, there's a little--you know, just a, a table--a, a coffee table book of all of his pieces, all of his art.  Here, let me--I'm just gonna show you because maybe you've seen it.  But, I'm just gonna show you.  Look at how beautiful that is.  Look at that (laughter).  And this is just a few.  This is life size.  This is a life size, taller than me and you.  And, and he's only like 5'2".  But, you know, he's phenomenal.  So, I'm glad he talked with me about, you know, starting this, you know, venture with him.
Speaker 1: And will you be here in Denver [Colorado]?
Speaker 2: We'll be right here, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We'll be here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 611020
Speaker 1: Is there anything in your life that you haven't done that you would like to do?
Speaker 2: Write a couple of books, um-hm, yeah.  Oh--
Speaker 1: What would they be about?
Speaker 2: --look at there.  I'm starting a publishing company.  I guess I can publish my own, huh?  One of the books I'd like to write about actually is my, my mother-in-law, my--you know, my--you know, not my mother [Ruth Smith Boyd] but my mother-in-law because--and I wanted to do it on--and I may need your help with this because I wanted to do it on her, her family.  They're a interesting family.  They will always be a part of my life.  She died a couple of years ago.  She died the same day that Mother Teresa died, and I'm gonna--it's so ironic.  My mom died the same day Toot died, you know, Barack Obama's [maternal] grandmother [Madelyn Dunham].  You know, so I mean--I don't know how symbolic it is, but you know, it's some days that we will remember.  And they died both--you know, my mother-in-law, she died on 9/11 [September 11, 2001].  So, that's the same day--yeah, as Mother Teresa [sic.].  And then so this is the day before the election, so I can remember the--I'll be able to remember those days vividly.  But I'd like to do a book on her, her family.  She--and, you know, everyone called her mama.  This book would be 'St. Mama' [ph.], you know, because she is--she gave and gave and gave and gave.  She never smoked, never drank.  She gave it and she worked tirelessly.  She worked until, god, she worked forever.  You know, she was--
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Elsie McSwain, E-L-S-I-E, McSwain, M-C-S-W-A-I-N.  She worked for several different white families all of her life, the Crowdies [ph.], C-R--you know, the Crowdies, the--oh, what--and she would work and they'd give her all of their left--you know, leftover stuff that--you know, all--you know, all her leftover stuff.  They had a room in the house where they'd give her all kinds of leftover stuff, you know, stuff that they didn't want, you know, that they'd--she'll be sending to a thrift store.  They had a room in their house where it was just, you know, a room full of stuff.  They just--she'd take it home and Chester [Chester McSwain] and Jenett [Jenett McSwain], and they'd put it in that room, they'd put it in that room, you know, just put it--stuff would be piled up.  But, you know, she just had an interesting life.  She--it's just an interesting life on her, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I probably won't even go into all the details.  You know, she had a--she had six kids, you know, and so--you know, so many around her died before she died.  And when she died, she had colon--not, not colon--yeah, I think it was colon cancer, colon cancer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The other story would be on a, a young lady here who I'd hate to say it but I would--I see her--you remember the movie, 'The Bad Seed'?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think she's a--I think she's a true bad seed, kind of the same situation.  I would not say her name, but same kind of situation.  She's in--yeah, yeah.  I can't--yeah.  But that would be another story which I think could be a wonderful movie.
Story_ID: 611021
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I think I'd like to be considered as a--
Speaker 1: 'Cause I'm gonna also ask you how do you want to be remembered, so what do you want your legacy to be and then how do you want people to remember you?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I think my legacy would be is I was one who was a messenger, you know, as a innovator, one who provided the way and road for other people to display their talents.  There's a lot of writers who have never written before.  There's a lot of--as far as the--that's the wind.  It's getting windy out there.  And as far as the Denver Urban Spectrum, I think that we provide avenues for many, many, many people.  You know, I've wanted to be one that will--one of who have provided the way for a lot of our young people and supported them and guided them, you know, to pull out their true talent, you know, and--because I--you know, when we started the youth foundation [Urban Spectrum Youth Foundation, Denver, Colorado], it's like, okay, and this was the concept.  You know, we needed kids that were out on the streets, if they were--if they were selling drugs, if they were doing graffiti, it's like, look, you can sell drugs, come in here and sell some advertising, okay?  Okay, you do graffiti?  Come in here.  We got something in here for you, too, you know, draw something on the cover of this art, you know.  So, I saw a way--I--you know, if you like to write, you know, you like to rap, come on in here, you can put that down on paper, you know.  So, that's one of the--you know, that's one of the ways, you know, that my, my first concept for the--you know, for the youth foundation.  But we didn't get--you know, we didn't get those, you know.  We just got some that were straight A students.  You know, there's one Krista Mann [ph.].  She's, she's gonna--she'll, she'll probably be the next Oprah [Oprah Winfrey].  You know, her name is Krista Mann.  And she's--she'll be here.  I just got an email.  She went through the program years ago and she's a wonderful soccer player, female soccer player, but she's a journalist also and she's doing the--sports commentator.  So, I--I've seen some wonderful kids, some wonderful youth that have come through the program and they're--you know, just want to be there for them and pass--I want to pass my knowledge on to them and I want to teach them because they're gonna be the voice, all right, now they're gonna be the voice and the generations are changing.
Story_ID: 611022
Speaker 1: So how do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I guess as one who cared, one who gave back, you know, one who wanted to just pass it on, you know.  You know, when you teach, you know, when you learn, you teach and when you get, you give, you know.  That's all I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Because this is going to be a tape that people will see many, many generations from now, is there a message that you would want to send to the future generations?
Speaker 2: I want to say that they, they need to believe in themselves--they need to believe in themselves, respect their elders, know that they can be whatever they want to be, love their selves, and--yeah, love themselves first.  If they love themselves, then they should love everybody else.
Story_ID: 611023
Speaker 1: Is there anything that we have not talked about that you would like to talk about?
Speaker 2: I don't know if I'd really like to talk about it, but I'm, I'm just gonna share it.  I'll just be traveling tonight and I did, you know, for--you know, you do know that two days ago, I lost my mother [Ruth Smith Boyd], and I was reluctant about doing this, but I said that I would do it in her honor because I couldn't do it without her.  You know, I couldn't do it without her.  I think she gave me the strength to do this today.  So, I thank you for the honor, you know, of, of letting me tell my story.
Speaker 1: We want to thank you for taking this time because I know it's a very stressful time and a time that you're going to be with your family, and for you to stop and actually do this just shows the strength and courage that can be shown to other people in the future generations about what it takes to, to stand up in, in the face of adversity, be able to just keep going on.  So, thank you very much for--
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: --taking the time to share your story.
Speaker 2: Okay, thank you.
Speaker 1: You're welcome.
