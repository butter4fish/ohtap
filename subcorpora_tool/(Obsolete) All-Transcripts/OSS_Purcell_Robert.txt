 Gill. Today is April 24, 2009. I   m visiting with Dr.  Robert Purcell on the Oklahoma State University campus in Stillwater,  Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project of the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Dr. Purcell, thank you for  taking time from your busy day to visit with us.  Pleasure to be here.  And I want to welcome you back to Oklahoma State University. I  understand it   s been several years since you   ve been back on campus.  Several years.  I also want to congratulate you on your recognition in the College of  Arts and Sciences as the Distinguished Alumnus of 2009. That   s quite an  honor. Congratulations to you.  Thank you.  There   s got to be a great story about how a small-town boy from  Haileyville, Oklahoma, can be Co-Chief of the Laboratory for Infectious  Diseases and the National Institute of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.  I   ve got to ask you, out of curiosity, have you ever gone to Pete   s Place  there in Krebs?  I was at Pete   s Place the night before last. Every time I come back I go  to Pete   s Place. One of my favorite places.  I   ve got to ask you this. Did you have any Choc beer?  I had my Choc beer, and I had my calf fries.  5  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  You got right into the culture, then.  Right in.  That   s great. Can you share some memories of your family and growing  up in Haileyville?  Yes, I was actually in the third grade, about nine years old, when I  moved to Haileyville from Dallas, Texas. My family had lived there for  several years, so it was quite a change from suburban Dallas to rural  Haileyville, but it was an interesting place to grow up. My mother and  father were both school teachers. We actually came to Oklahoma  because my father managed a fishing and auto supply store in McAlester  and bought a house in Haileyville rather than McAlester because he  found something he liked there. So, we lived in Haileyville. He  commuted to McAlester, and eventually he got back into teaching, so he  taught science in Hartshorne, and my mother taught English in  Haileyville. In fact, I had her as an English teacher, so it was a pretty  good basic education with two teacher parents. I had that influence at  home and then the interesting characteristics of Haileyville and the  surrounding area I grew up with, also.  Small-town environment?  Yes, small-town environment.  It   s good and bad because if you did something good, everybody knew  about it. If you did something bad, everybody knew about it.  Everybody knew.  Were there some values that you learned early in your life from your  family that have influenced your life since?  Well, my parents were Depression-era people, so, like many people who  grew up and experienced the Great Depression, they knew to be careful  about money, and they knew the value of hard work, and they knew the  value of honesty and responsibility. I think they taught not only me but  my two brothers those characteristics, also.  There were three boys in your family?  Yes, I was the middle boy. My older brother was in the Navy in World  War II. He came back, then, to Haileyville, finished high school there,  then went to Wilburton for two years, then up to Oklahoma State. I did  the same, and my younger brother did the same.  6  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Well, that was the next question. What influenced you to go to Oklahoma  State University? Was that basically because you were following your  brother?  In part, that. We were not a wealthy family. School teachers never got  paid very much, so school was less expensive at Wilburton. Then we  came up here. My brother so much enjoyed his training here that,  naturally, I had to come up here, also.  What were your first impressions of Oklahoma State University? Had  you been up there before, since your brother had been there?  We   d come to visit occasionally. It seemed like a very nice campus, and  certainly still is.  Well, what do you remember about it? What stood out in your mind?  Well, of course, the library had just been completed not long before that,  so that was kind of a central focus. The hotel training program was in  place by then, so that was the functioning part of the campus and was  somewhat prominent. When I came up, I joined the Sigma Nu fraternity,  and we were just right across from Theta Pond, so campus was spread  out before us.  Did you have some favorite hangouts on campus and off campus? Places  where you went for fun, enjoyment, and recreation?  Well, down the Strip just around the corner, as I understand, has  changed almost not at all, all those years. Just wherever the action was.  Do you remember where some of your classes were held on campus,  which buildings?  Well, I was a chemistry major, and so the chemistry laboratories were in  one of the infamous Quonset huts, which I understand are pretty much  all gone by now. So, I spent a fair amount of time in those inferno  buildings.  Were the labs there as well?  Yes.  Must have been exciting.  Yes, it was exciting.  7  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Good quality control in the Quonset hut.  Yes, real quality control.  What about your student experience, organizations you were a part of,  leaderships activities? Can you share a little bit about your student  experience with us?  Yes, I was pretty busy because I was taking a full load. I took up to  twenty hours of classes some semesters, so I was busy doing that. But I  was president of the Arts and Sciences  Student  Council one year. That  was probably the biggest extracurricular activity I was involved with.  Do you remember some of your faculty advisors, some of your  instructors, professors that were influential to you?  Yes, certainly the chemistry professors. Virginia Lippert, who was in  charge of the chemistry laboratories, she was a real mentor to me. I   ve  been very pleased with my interactions with her. She was an important  person. Dr.  Ernest  Hodnett and Dr.  Ruth Mildred  Gerber, and there  were a number of other faculty members. Dr. Glass in biological      Bryan Glass?  Yes, Bryan Glass. Bryan Glass was also an instructor for my older  brother who majored in fish and wildlife, so I had a lot of contact with  Dr. Glass.  You graduated in 1957 with a bachelor   s degree, and your major was  chemistry?  Yes, my major was chemistry.  Do you have some special memories from your time here at Oklahoma  State University, some highlights?  I remember one really frightening time when we had one of those storms  that you can only have in Oklahoma. I don   t think anybody saw a  tornado in that storm, but it was a huge storm with, I think, about eight  inches of rain fell in about two hours. It was one of those horrendous  storms. My fraternity brothers and I were going to go rescue people. A  lot of people were stranded. One of them had a boat, I think, so we went  off to save the world, almost drowned ourselves. Barely made it back.  You were in the last graduating class of Oklahoma A M?  8  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  That   s exactly right.  Do you take pride in that?  I do take pride in that. We were given the option of turning in our  diplomas to get one that said Oklahoma State instead of Oklahoma  A M, but I didn   t do that. I said I was proud of being an Aggie for life.  What did you think about the name change of Oklahoma A M to  Oklahoma State, and from Aggies to Cowboys? Was that okay with you?  It was okay with me. Yes, it was okay with me. I imagine a lot of people  got upset by it.  There were some alumni that are still upset  Do you feel like your  background, your training, academic preparation that you got at  Oklahoma State University helped prepare you for graduate school and  your later career?  It did. I was very pleased with the training I got here. It was a big help  and has continued to be a help all of these years.  So, you left Oklahoma State University and then went to Baylor for your  master   s degree. Can you share some of your graduate experiences?  Yes, I went to Baylor, started medical school and took a combined  program which is a MD and master   s degree. It was one of the earlier  programs. Now, many of the schools have combined MD/PhD  programs, but that was not common then. So, I took advantage of that  program. Then, after two years, I transferred to Duke University.  Finished my master   s degree, transferred to Duke University, finished  my MD degree there. Took a pediatric internship, then I joined the  Epidemic Intelligence Service of the CDC  Communicable Disease  Center .  Epidemiology and pediatrics. That   s a quite a swing, isn   t it?  That   s quite a swing, yes. Quite a swing.  When did you first realize your passion for medical research? I think I  read somewhere in your biography that you really realized early on that  you didn   t want to be a practicing physician, that you really wanted to  do research. When did you first feel that passion for research?  Well, it was interesting when my older brother was up here at Oklahoma  State, Oklahoma A M then, and he would come to visit periodically.  9  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  He   d been taking interesting courses, and he   d come down and show me  something he had learned. I remember once he came down and brought  a copy of Scientific American. I   d never seen that magazine before, and I  was just really excited about that. I thought,    Gee, this sounds like  something I   d really like to do,    so I got interested in science then. Then,  when I was at Wilburton, my science instructor Andre Strata from  McAllen, Texas, really got me interested in chemistry. He was one of  these kinds of mentors who can really build a fire under people. So, that  was how I got interested in chemistry and why I majored in chemistry.  So, why epidemiology? What appealed to you about that field?  Well, I was joining the Public Health Service, and I decided to join it  through CDC with this program that they had. Epidemiology is linked to  infectious diseases. I was interested in infectious diseases because  pediatrics is largely infectious diseases. A lot of it is infectious diseases,  and so I got in that program. Most of the people in that two-year  program are either sent to a state public health office or stay at the CDC  for epidemic investigations and such. But at the time, the NIH  National  Institutes of Health  had some extra money, and they were funding some  positions for vaccine development, and I was selected for one of those  positions. So, after finishing basic epidemiology training, which is about  a two-month training course at CDC, I was transferred to the NIH, and  that   s where I   ve been ever since.  The Epidemic Intelligence Service, is that where you did your short  internship?  Yes, yes. It   s called EIS, Epidemic Intelligence Service. That   s where  you learn basic epidemiology and statistics and infectious diseases and  all that stuff.  And I guess the timing was good for you because there were some  researchers coming to the front on some of those diseases at that time?  Yes, actually, the timing was very good. It was sort of the golden age of  virology. Tissue cultures had become available, and people were  discovering new viruses all the time. So, it was just a great opportunity.  Was any of your work with communicable diseases, through the years  and up to now, with bioterrorism, or was your work strictly in other  areas?  Well, it   s interesting. After 9/11, a big chunk of my work actually  became directly involved with bioterrorism. As a part of our program on  hepatitis viruses, we do studies in animals, and the only animals that are  10  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  susceptible to most of the hepatitis viruses are non-human primates. And  the only animal susceptible to all five of the hepatitis viruses is  chimpanzees. So, we did studies (in fact, we still are doing studies) in  chimpanzees. And one of the things we had done was to make  monoclonal antibodies that were specific to the hepatitis viruses in the  chimpanzees, because we infected them with the viruses to study other  aspects of it. Then, we could just make antibodies from them based on  their past experience with the viruses. These are virtually identical to  human antibodies, so you can actually use them for therapy or for  prophylaxis. So, we expanded that program to make antibodies to a  number of the agents of concern, in terms of bioterrorism. We made  antibodies to small pox virus. We made antibodies to all of the toxins of  the anthrax bacillus. We are making antibodies to rabies virus and to a  number of other agents. So, that turned out to be a fairly large program.  Was part of that work classified?  Not what we were doing. That wasn   t classified, but many of these  agents you cannot work on in just any laboratory. For instance, the work  on making monoclonal antibodies to small pox required collaboration  with the CDC because there are only two laboratories in the world  anymore that can work on the actual small pox virus. The CDC is one,  and the other is in Russia.  Dating back to 1963 when you first started to work with the Laboratory  for Infectious Diseases, you   ve had a long and distinguished career. Can  you share some of the highlights of your research and things that  brought you special recognition in those areas?  Yes. Some of the first things I did when I got there had to do with  epidemiology and had to do with field trials of vaccines that were being  developed in the laboratory by my mentor, Robert Chanock. One was a  vaccine against adenoviruses that were causing an enormous amount of  illness in Marine recruits at Parris Island, South Carolina, first where  they take their basic training, then at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.  They would have whole barracks of Marines down sick, with some  occasional deaths. So, my mentor, Bob Chanock, had developed a way  of making a live adenovirus vaccine that could be taken in a capsule.  Whereas it normally causes a severe respiratory disease and an infection  of the upper respiratory tract and the lungs, if you took it in a capsule,  then it would infect your intestinal tract but wouldn   t cause respiratory  disease. That worked. It was a wonderful vaccine. It completely  eradicated that problem in the Marine recruits. So, that was an exciting  actual field study that I did. I went to Camp Lejeune and Parris Island  and followed the Marine recruits down there in a vaccine program. So,  that was one exciting thing.  11  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Then, Bob Chanock wanted to start a hepatitis program, but at the time,  virtually nothing was known about the hepatitis viruses. There were no  tests for them, and it wasn   t clear how many there were. It was thought,  based on epidemiology, that there were two, and, so, to begin collecting  clinical materials that we could study and try to find the viruses, we set a  perspective study in the heart surgery unit at NIH that was International  Heart, Lung and Blood Institute at the time. This was also the early days  of open heart surgery and valve replacement. It required a lot of blood  because the blood pumps were pretty primitive at the time. It took an  average of eighteen units of blood per operation for these individuals.  And we knew some of them developed hepatitis, but we had no idea  how many, and, so, we began following them from before surgery up to  at least a year after surgery. And we found, much to our dismay, that  one-third of them developed hepatitis after their surgery from the blood  that was contaminated, and no one had any idea how contaminated the  blood was. Of those that got commercial blood, blood that was bought  from people that were willing to give their blood for anything, 50  percent of them, half of them, developed hepatitis. This was just  unbelievable.  So, over the years, partly from that study where materials were collected  and epidemiology of transfusion-associated hepatitis was better  understood, and from a number of other studies, that   s no longer a  problem. It   s one of the great medical success stories that most people  don   t really know about. Now, fewer than one in two million blood  recipients gets hepatitis. So, the ability to screen out bad blood has been  a tremendous success story.  So, you were able to check samples and detect the presence?  Yes, before giving the blood. So, now all those are gotten rid of, and,  also, we don   t buy blood anymore. All blood is volunteer blood now.  That also cut way down on the number of cases. That probably  prevented more cases of hepatitis than the screening did.  You   ve indicated that some of your, and I   m quoting here,    most  important research findings were somewhat unexpected,    end quote.  Can you elaborate on that?  Well, we had no idea, for instance, how many hepatitis viruses there  were. As I said, we thought there were two. It turns out there   s at least  five. There are five that we know about. We think we may have a sixth  one, now, that we   re working on at the moment. So, those were all  unexpected things; every one was a new one. One of the hepatitis viruses  that caused big epidemics in Asia was thought to be hepatitis A virus.  We used to call it infectious hepatitis virus, but it turned out that was an  12  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  entirely new virus that hadn   t been expected at all before. So, that was  another unexpected finding.  Well, I was looking at your resume and, if I might say,    impressive     would be an understatement. You   ve received more than 40  national/international awards, medals and recognitions including  National Institutes of Health Distinguished Investigator, U.S. Public  Health Distinguished Service Award, King Faisal International Award.  You have more than 45 U.S. patents; you   ve published more than 700  papers. And I was looking at where you have presented, and I don   t  know how you had time to research, because you were going all around  the world   Yes, I   ve traveled a lot.  So, my point is, out of all that, what has brought you the most personal  satisfaction in all these contributions that you   ve made to science and to  medicine?  Well, I think being involved, one, in the discovery of hepatitis viruses  and, two, in developing vaccines against them and seeing the effects of  those vaccines. Of course, we   re not the only ones who have worked on  vaccines, but we   ve contributed to this area of research. And seeing the  effect that these vaccines are having on the population is tremendously  satisfying. It   s one of those things that you can feel you   re really doing  something worthwhile, and it   s hard, sometimes, to find things that  actually are in that category. I look at Wall Street and what   s going on  there in the past year or two, and I would not trade places with them.  Although, I would trade salaries with them.  It   s got to be a great personal satisfaction that, literally, you   ve  probably saved thousands of lives with this research.  Well, it   s interesting. At least two, and possibly three, of the hepatitis  viruses are also cancer viruses. And two of them, hepatitis B virus and  hepatitis C virus, account for most of the liver cancer in the world.  Alcoholism has its fair share also, but basically it   s those two viruses.  And there are between 300-350 million people who are chronically  infected with hepatitis B virus at the moment and about      How many? 350 million?  Up to 350 million. Yes, it   s a third of a billion. And over 170 million  chronically infected with hepatitis C virus. And so, certainly, with  hepatitis B, having the tools at hand to prevent future infections, it is  tremendously satisfying. About 40 percent of those chronically infected  13  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  with hepatitis B, at least in Asia, go on and die of something related to  their chronic hepatitis B infection. They either die of chronic hepatitis or  they die of cirrhosis of the liver, or they die of liver cancer caused by the  virus. So, one of my post-docs from years ago is a prominent physician  and public health person in Taiwan. He was instrumental in reducing  hepatitis B vaccine as a universal pediatric vaccine in Taiwan, about  1984, I think it was. And you can already see now, not only the  prevalence of infection in the population, which was like about 10  percent of the population chronically infected before, it   s now down to  virtually nothing. And they   re already beginning to see liver cancer  becoming less frequent. In the very young, instances of that disease is  diminishing. So, you see this ongoing change in the public health. Not  just one country, but countries all over the world, and it   s an enormous  impact. It really is true that vaccines are one of the most cost-effective  medical interventions that you can have, and, so, it   s really exciting to be  able to work on them.  Are there some other examples of scientists who have worked under you  in post-docs or have studied under you who have gone on and made  some significant contributions?  Yes, a number of them have done very well. Jules Dienstag was a post-doc  who worked under me on hepatitis A, and he went on to become the  Dean for Research at Harvard. He just stepped down from that post  recently. Another of the deans at Harvard, also in our laboratory at the  same time, he worked under someone else at the laboratory. So, the  laboratory had a really sterling reputation over the years.  When you were a young scientist, did you ever imagine that you   d make  these kinds of medical and scientific contributions? In your wildest  dreams, did you ever think that?  No, I just enjoyed science. I really didn   t think in those terms when I  first got into it. I just enjoyed doing things. I enjoyed the laboratory. I  enjoyed finding new things and solving problems. It was just fun.  It is fun, but let me get on the other side. I   ve got to think of all that, the  hours in the laboratory. I mean, the hours and the years of research  you   ve put into it. What   s kept you going all these years? You   re still  going strong in your seventies here.  Type A personality, probably.  I   m not suggesting you   re a driven personality, but there had to be some  passion, something to keep you going all that time.  14  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Well, yes, it   s just learning new things and, as I mentioned, solving  problems. You see this problem, and you want to figure out a way to  solve it, answer a question. You answer that one, and then it asks you  another question. It   s just an ongoing sort of thing. And I   ve worked  with all five of the viruses over the years, and, so, it   s kind of a  constantly changing thing. It   s not exactly the same thing all the time, so  it keeps you from getting bored.  Do you enjoy teaching? I notice you   ve been an adjunct professor at  several prestigious universities including Georgetown. What were some  of the others?  Johns Hopkins, the School of Public Health there. For a number of years  I gave lectures. Yes, I enjoyed doing that. I haven   t done it for a while.  It   s hard to stay up with the cutting edge of the field in all those various  areas, but I did enjoy that. I enjoyed the students. Some of them were  really bright and asked good questions.  You   ve perhaps answered this peripherally, but I   ll ask you again. Do  you have some special memories and highlights from your career out of  all those recognitions and awards and discoveries? What have been  some real highlights for you in your career?  Well, traveling to new places has been a highlight. I enjoy traveling.  And because these viruses are much more important in developing  countries than they are in industrial countries, by and large, it   s taken me  to a lot of really interesting places. I   ve had an opportunity to see a good  bit, certainly not all but a good bit, of the world largely through travels  related to my work, either attending meetings in these places or being  involved in field studies and such.  Dr. Purcell, having taught and been around some of these scientists, do  you have any advice for students and aspiring scientists that you   d give?  Someone who wants to get into medical scientific research in your  areas, what advice would you give?  Well, to get the best training they possibly can, I think, for one thing. As  in every other endeavor, there   s a fair amount of bad science out there,  too, so they need to get into a good laboratory with first-rate scientists  who are critical thinkers, who can teach them how to approach a  problem in the proper way. I think that is very important. I was very  lucky to get into the laboratory at National Institutes of Health  Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, and when I got in that laboratory, it  had three National Academy of Sciences members at the same time.  They were all three world-class biologists, so I had a tremendous  opportunity to learn these things in the right way.  15  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  I think you mentioned earlier that you are also a member of the National  Academy of Sciences. Is that correct?  Yes, I am.  What kind of skill sets do you see that students here at Oklahoma State  University would need to acquire to be successful researchers?  Oh, science has changed so much over the years. It   s changed so much  in the past five or ten years. They need good mathematical skills and  information science skills, something I never had and still don   t have.  They certainly need to be computer savvy because so much of what is  done now can only be done with sophisticated computers. They also  need to keep an open mind, and they need to be able to think critically.  They need to keep their head screwed on right, I think, and keep things  in perspective. I think  they  sometimes lose that along the way.  Remember what   s important and why they   re in science to begin with,  which, I hope, in most cases is because they really enjoy it.  You   ve been back   I guess, maybe, this is your only day at Oklahoma  State. Have you had a chance to visit with any of the students here or  any of the departments?  Yes, I   ve had several opportunities today to meet with some students. I  was extremely impressed. They were really, really good students. They  were bright, and they all have good futures. They already know pretty  much where they are going and what they   re going to be doing.  Did any of them hit you up for a job?  No, haven   t done that.  I know they   re excited to have you back on campus, Dr. Purcell. I   m  surprised they haven   t had you back for a lecture before. They had some  conversations with you about coming back, I hope, and staying  connected?  Yes, over the years I maintained probably not as much connection as I  should have, but it   s   as you see, I   ve been busy.  What are some special memories that you have of your time here at  Oklahoma State University that stand out for you?  Long hours at the library. I don   t know. I enjoyed the campus life. It  wasn   t all work here. I enjoyed teaching the chemistry labs here. That  was my first opportunity to actually do a little teaching, and I enjoyed  16  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  Purcell  Gill  that a lot.  You must have been a pretty good student politician since you were  president of the Arts and Sciences Student Council, you mentioned.  I think they were hard up for somebody at that time.  We   ve talked about the many things you   ve done, looking back at all  you   ve accomplished in your career, people that know you. How do you  hope people will remember you?  Well, I hope some of them, at least, will appreciate what I   ve done for  them as a mentor because I really appreciated what people did for me. It  made a big difference in how I ended up and where I ended up, just by a  few important people taking a little time and pointing me in the right  direction. So, I hope I   ve done that for the people who have passed  through my laboratory.  Are you going to keep your work boots on forever, or do you have any  personal interests in mind?  Well, I   m going to step down as co-lab chief in about another year, and  then I   ll stay on for another two or three years, I think, to wind up my  work, close things down. Then I   ll be ready to hang up my boots and  spurs.  Got to have your spurs, being a cowboy   Yes.  Do you have any hobbies or activities you are looking forward to?  Well, despite all the traveling I   ve done, I enjoy traveling, so I   ll  probably continue to do some of that. I enjoy gardening and being out of  doors, so I   ll find ways to keep myself busy, I think.  Well, I appreciate, again, you taking the time to interview with us. Is  there anything you   d like to talk about that we didn   t discuss?  No, I think you did a pretty thorough job of going through my CV  bibliography.  It would have taken a lot more time to have gone through all your  bibliography, but just on our behalf, we   d like to tell you we   re proud of  you as an alumnus of Oklahoma State University. Again,  congratulations on your recognition from the College of Arts and  17  Purcell  Sciences.  Thank you very much.  -------  -------
