Ellen Craft Dammond:
We're talking with Dr. Chinn. This interview for the Black Women Oral History Project, which will go in—the copy of the interview will go into the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe College. And so today, I have the honor and the pleasure of taping you— today being June 27, 1979, here at my home in New Rochelle. And I think to get things started a little bit with Dr. May E. Chinn—and we'll come back to what the E stands for a little later.* We'll identify myself, the interviewer, Ellen Craft Dammond, and I like to call myself an almost lifelong friend; certainly all the years I have lived in New York I have known you and admired you. And we have visiting with us today, who may be talking with us from time to time, Sina E. Kelly, Sina Estelle Kelly, I know what her middle name stands for, the daughter of Gladys Caution Kelly, one of the first black social workers in New York City, and the granddaughter of Estelle Caution, the founder of...
Sina E. Kelly: Ellen Craft Dammond: Sina E. Kelly: Ellen Craft Dammond:
The Katy Ferguson Home...
The Katy Ferguson Home...
...for unmarried mothers in Harlem.
In Harlem, thank you. And we hope someday that, as part of the Black Women Oral History Project, we'll be interviewing you, Sina Kelly, because your story, as an atomic energy chemist, must be told, somehow. This is our task for today, and I think that those who will be doing research on you, Dr. Chinn, spelled Dr. May, M-A-Y, E. Chinn, C-H-I-N-N, need to know that there is a great deal of other information in addition to this tape, as they do their research. The flew York Times, in the fall of 1977 did a wonderful article on you, first as an interview by Charlayne Hunter... Yes?
* This question was never answered. The E stands for Edward.﻿2
MC: I think that was '76, wasn't it?
ED: In 1976. We have it right here before us...let's check that date. November 1, 1977.
MC: Oh, was it? Oh, I'm sorry.
ED: Yes, 1977. The New York Times, through Charlayne Hunter, did a wonderful interview about you and several other, four or five other Negro women doctors...
MC: Who had practiced fifty years or more in New York and New Jersey.
ED: Very good. We want to get that story. And they need to know that there
was also the story of a luncheon that was given for you and three other..
MC: Four other.
ED: Four other women doctors, which we want to talk more about. So they can use that for research. They also can use for research the April twenty-second article in the New York Times Magazine section, that's April 22, 1979, and it's called "A Healing Hand in Harlem," by George Davis.
MC: Yes. George B. Davis.
ED: George B. Davis. So, in addition to all the information that we're going to get from you today, there are those other sources. Also, you've done a paper which may be housed some day at Fisk University, or it may be part of the book that you are writing at present...
MC: That's right.
ED: ...with George B. Davis. So, with all of that, we will start this
interview. But I simply wanted to make sure that those who are doing research in the years to come know of the other places that they can go.
MC: Did you want to mention the BBC?
ED: We'll come to that, because...as a result of the exposure that you got. So, Dr. Chinn, we start way back, don't we, in Virginia?
MC: In Great Barrington [Massachusetts], where I was born.
ED: Your parents married in Virginia, right? And you were born in Great Barrington.
MC: That's right.
ED: Could you tell us a little bit about your early beginnings? How about your mother and father? Your father...﻿3
MC: My father was an escaped slave, from the Chinn plantation in Virginia. He escaped when he was eleven years of age. How he got to Great Barrington, this I don't know. He was a man of a very few words, and we didn't know that part of his lfe. My mother was, her father was a slave whose wife was an American Indian of the Chickahominy tribe, which is a smaller tribe of the Algonquin tribe, whose homesite was along the Virginia coast. Her father left the camp and married a woman, married another woman, and so my mother felt badly about it, and she was taken by a Caucasian family to Great Barrington as a housekeeper. That's how they both got to Great Barrington.
ED: I see.
MC: Now, I was born in 1896. And I know very little about it, 'cause I
was very young at that time, but I have since found out, through George Davis, that my father paid poll tax when he lived in Great Barrington. Isn't that interesting?
ED: I see. The significance of which...
MC: He paid two dollars for poll tax, which meant that he was able to vote. He also paid fifty cents a week on property that he was buying for a homesite. This I found out through Dr. Davis. He's gone up and investigated it all...
ED: He's gone and done research.
MC: I knew nothing about it myself.
ED: Isn't that interesting. Yes, this is very significant to us as...
MC: Yes. So, and as I say, when I was three years old, they came to New York.
ED: Mm hmm. You were born in 1876 in Great Barrington.
MC: No, 1896.
ED: I mean 1896. [laughter]
MC: Yes, 1896 in Great Barrington. I remember...
ED: So that your father moved there, probably... Well, you say he escaped... you don't know. You don't know how old he was, he didn't say how old he was when he got to Great Barrington?
MC: No, he didn't. That we knew nothing about. He didn't talk about his escape. He just got to Great Barrington by...and how long it took him to get there I don't know.
ED: And before the beginning of Roots, we didn't question our parents and﻿4
ED: (cont.) grandparents as closely as we...
MC: That's right. Interestingly enough, I have no birth certificate. I didn't know that until 1949 when I was planning to go to Europe, and I needed a birth certificate for a passport, and I kept waiting and waiting for it. I wrote. And finally I drove up there, and they showed me the records that...at that time, there was nothing recorded about my birth, which was April 15, 1896. I finally got the passport, of course, because some relatives of mine in Washington...and mind you, I had been practicing medicine since 1928. Sol wasn't even born! [laughs]
ED:	And the question of a birth certificate had never come up.
MC:	That's right.
ED:	You know your date from your mother...
MC:	Yes, from my mother and my father.
ED:	...and your father. Word of mouth.
MC:	Word of mouth.
ED:	Is there an entrance in the Bible...
MC:	No, we have no family Bible. My father, by the way, was an atheist, so we didn't have a Bible in the house.
ED: There was no point along your career that you had to produce a birth certificate. What did they do about the passport?
MC: Well, some relatives of mine in Washington swore that I had been born, and so I got my passport on the strength... I think that two or three people knew that I was living, and...
ED: And they testified as to the date of your birth. Right, that's very interesting. And so, out of Great Barrington, you moved at the age of three...
MC: Yes, to New York. We came to New York when I was...in 1901. Now from that point on, of course, my mother and father... I remember a good deal of my life there, you see.
ED: You have a good memory for early childhood. I noticed in the articles, you remember well, going back.
MC: Yes. The interesting thing is, Mr. Davis has checked everything that I've said. Even that, my being in boarding school in Jersey, he checked the site...
ED:
He's a real researcher, isn't he?﻿5
MC: Oh, he really is.
ED: What is his field? Is it research, or writing, or— George Davis.
MC: He teaches English in the college. No, on this side — I think his college is up in the Bronx...
ED: Bronx Community College, it says in the article.
MC: Yes. Now he also is a writer himself, he's written two or three books, and evidently a researcher. Because, I said, he's telling me things about myself that I didn't...that he has authenticated, things about myself.
ED: He's a basic researcher, in addition to his other talents, because this delving for the exactness of facts is certainly very helpful to you, isn't it, and also to us as people who will read the book, it's nice to know that he insists so on accuracy.
MC: Yes. Oh, he's an excellent person to be working with.
ED: One of the things that impressed me in reading your life story in condensed form, and has made me eager to read more, to talk to you more, is really an opportunity to understand your sensitivity due to...
MC: I didn't get that.
ED: The understanding of your sensitivity due	to what you went through,
living in New York City, and the terrible	discrimination and prejudice
that followed you almost the entire time,	didn't it?
MC: That's right.
ED: And I think that that's very well brought out in the article, "A Healing Hand in Harlem." Where did you get this kind of perseverance?
MC: I had a most remarkable mother.
ED: I gathered so.
MC: Most remarkable. She was a person of very few words, but she planned
ahead, and if we had a problem, she just sort of... Finally came to the conclusion that the better thing to do would be...*cause there were problems all along. For instance, like the problem that my father, being weak and alcoholic, the living through that was a horrible thing for a child. So that is why my mother thought getting me into a boarding school, getting me out of that environment, would help me.
ED: At what age did she send you to...
MC: I think...Mr. Davis and I tried to work that out. I think it was between﻿6
MC: (cont.) five and six years of age. It may have been a little bit
earlier, but it was somewheres in through there. And this boarding school was a very interesting place in that it was connected with the church there, and we were supposed to have the basic training and the education, but we also were taught some occupation. For instance, the boys were taught carpentry, and plumbing and gardening and what-have-you. And the girls were taught cooking and sewing and house cleaning. And I believe they made a little bit of money for the school by hiring these children out to people in the community.
ED: Were all of the children Negro?
MC: Yes.
ED: And the school was where?
MC: It was in Bordentown.
ED: Oh, Bordentown, New Jersey. Right, right.
MC: It's since been changed, the name has been..-Bordentown Institution...
ED: Yes. The Bordentown Industrial Training School?
MC: Yes.
ED: That was its old name.
MC: That was its... I don't know whether that was a later name, but that
is what it___ The infant of this large thing that finally developed,,
the large house.
ED: Yes. I'd like to stop at this point and just establish your choice of the word Negro. I'm inclined to say black, although I've done a great deal of thinking about it. Could you share with us why you prefer the term Negro to black or colored or Afro-American?
MC: Well, Negro... At least black to me means nothing. In other words, if you look at the Negro race, if you're basing it on color, it varies anywheres from the blondest, blue-eyed person to the very blackest African. And so, but there's all of this shading between. So you can't call the shading in between black, you see? The other thing that through the years, the word black to my mind has meant that you are inferior, because black is supposed to be inferior to white. And I prefer Negro, simply because Negroes came from Africa. You know, it gives us, to me, a status. But black doesn't mean a thing to me. Doesn't mean a thing to me, at all.
ED: Have you ever thought of the term colored as a choice?
MC: I had thought of colored, but then again, I have to tell you a little﻿7
MC: (cont.) story. Time for a story here?
ED: Sure, surely.
MC: Let's see if I can make it very short. A very prominent Negro family— I won't mention the name—asked me, Would I come to their... A very prominent white family, a Caucasian family, asked me, Would I come to their home—with another colored woman who was rather prominent—to meet four of the delegates from the U.N.? And we went, and these men were very, very black. They were very black. They were immaculately dressed. Their English was perfect. And when we, this other colored, Negro woman and I came in, the Caucasians were seated on the floor, just staring up into their eyes. And of course these men loved it, you know. They were speaking this beautiful English and what have you. When the party was over, the hostess, who was Caucasian, asked two of the delegates, Would they see this other woman and myself home? Oh, they would be very happy to. So we got into a c.ab, and halfway home, one of the delegates, who was, as I said, very black, turned to us and said, "You know, we wouldn't marry anybody like you, because you are mongrels." Well, we were breathless. You know, we hadn't asked for anything! We were mongrels! When I got my breath, I finally said, "Well, who would you marry?" "Well, we would marry the daughter of the most important delegate—Caucasian—that we could. She may be blue-eyed and blond, but she would have to be Caucasian." So again, I was trying to get my breath, and so I said to him, "It's quite possible, then, that if we are mongrels, your children will be mongrels too."
ED: And he hadn't thought that far.
MC: Hadn't thought of it.
ED: Isn't that an interesting story? Yes, I've never heard something put quite that way.
MC: Well, that's the truth. That's the truth.
ED: Did that influence, subtly or directly, the idea of never saying you're black?
MC: No, no, I never thought of being a mongrel.
ED: No, I mean of not wanting to identify yourself as black, maybe, was
that part of the influence? Or it's just a story that comes to mind.
MC: Yes, just a story that comes to mind. But again, as I say, the Negro
to me suggests an origin from Africa, and that I am proud of. My father, who looked like a Caucasian, but had a difficulty in being a Negro, was proud of the fact that he was a Negro. He was proud of the fact that he had enough intellect to escape from that plantation. And he was proud of that fact, that at eleven years old, he was able to outwit them, and get his freedom.
ED: So that you grew up with a parent, both parents, who had this sense of﻿8
ED:	(cont.) pride.
MC:	That's right.
ED:	And also, you knew who you were.
MC:	Yes.
ED:	Because, being fair, he never tried to be white.
MC:	Oh, never.
ED:	He was glad, and proud of the fact that he had black blood.
MC: Yes, that's right. And my mother was proud of the fact that she was
from the Indian descent, because they were the original people of America. She was really an American. And she was a mixture of this African, which they were proud of, being Africans in their own country.
ED: Don't you think it gives a lot of stability to come up as a child, aware of who you are, in terms...
MC: Oh, definitely.
ED: And not being a part of the group that wants to escape their identity.
MC: That's right.
ED: Don't you think this makes for mental health? As a doctor, did you observe this in children?
MC: Oh, definitely so. Absolutely. I feel, I've always felt free, regardless of where I was, with whom I was associated with, that I had an identity which I was proud of. I didn't have to hide under anything, and I didn't have to be afraid of being discovered, that I was something else, you know.
ED: I imagine the name Chinn, C-H-I-N-N, caused some confusion, didn't it, in terms of where you...
MC: Now that's a terribly long story.
ED: Yes, well, I think we would like to hear this, because we have so many different angles, in terms of our racial identity, but not too often is it confused with Oriental...
MC: Well, let me tell you. The Chinese spell the name C-H-I-N. They also spell it C-H-I-N-N. And this has been through all their dynasties. I think way back before Christ, I think there was a very important Chin Dynasty, if you recall. And, so that that is one of their dynasties.
ED: is it usually C-H-I-N? The Chinese?﻿9
MC: They spell it C-H, apostrophe, I-N—Ch'in. They break it up by the
apostrophe. And, as I said, if you look back in your Chinese history, there is a dynasty of a few years, and that has of course followed through, through China. Now, it happens that the C-H-I-N-N of which I am a member, they started on the other side of the world. They were Norsemen whose name is C-H-E-Y-N-E. During the spring when the ice melted, they would come to the coast of England, and try to establish a little colony there. And then, then they would have to go back to Norway before it froze over again. But they did that for years and years and years. So that finally, they had established a colony. And that is... the descendants. It is recorded in 1066, that the Cheyne colony was definitely established on the mainland, which was now England. So that they no longer had to go back and forth, you see.
ED: I see. And it is from that group that your parents...
MC: Yes, from that group. Now they spelled their name various ways. Cheyne, Chie...there are about four or five different ways that they spelled it, which if I ever get this thing, I can give you the way that they spelled it.
ED: The book that you once found, and have lost, and are going to get another copy of.
MC: Try to get another copy.
ED: You were telling me, right?
MC: Now the first group of Chinns that came to America cane in through Boston harbor, and that was in, I believe, 1638, something of that nature, and they established themselves in the New England states. Interestingly enough, descendants of theirs fought in the Revolutionary War. Now about a hundred years later, another colony came from England to America, but they came in through Virginia. And they established the Chinn plantation, in Virginia.
ED: I see. And this is the one, the plantation on which your father was born, and from where he got his name.
MC: This is the one that I, where my father was born, yes, and he got his name. Now, one other point there is that they fought in the southern war. Isn't that interesting?
ED: Maybe brothers, partly...relatives fighting relatives. It so often happened in the Civil War.
MC: Yes.
ED: Now, I think people of Harlem particularly, and perhaps other parts of
the country, have always wondered if you were related to the Negro doctor who practiced in Harlem at the same time that you did, Dr. Chester Chinn, Word had it that you were brother and sister.﻿10
MC: No, and tracing our families back, he is a descendant of the first
group of Chinns that came from England, and I am a descendant of the Virginia Chinns. I want to add one other point, that from this Virginia family of Chinns, Chinns scattered all over America.
ED: From the New England group?
MC: No, no, from the...
ED: The Virginia group.
MC: From the Virginia group. So much so that I have read material from Walter Chinn, a physician who was in public health in the state of Washington. Yes. But they were in Texas...
ED:	They're white.
MC:	They're white. Oh, yes.
ED:	Your father was the only child of his owner?
MC:	No, no, he was eleven... There was eleven...
ED:	Pardon me, by a black woman, by a Negro woman?
MC:	By the same black woman—
ED:	He had no brothers and sisters, of the eleven? They were all white, weren't they, his brothers and sisters?
MC: His brothers and sisters were the children of the Chinn owner and the same black woman, you see.
ED: Oh, I see, eleven brothers and sisters. These were his real brothers and sisters.
MC: That's right.
ED: So they went as Negroes, or did they go as white?
MC: Five of them, five of the women married white. They said that they
were—this will come out in the book—they claimed that they were from a very famous family. They were very beautiful, and one of them is reported to have married a senator.
ED: I see. I do remember that.
MC: And my father was a twin. His sister married a very black man.
ED: His twin sister?
His twin sister. Now my father didn't know this until he went back to see his family that he'd heard was in Washington. And my father's brother﻿11
MC: (cont.) didn't speak to my father's twin since she married a black man. There was this prejudice.
ED: Isn't that interesting. Now, did your father's twin identify herself as Negro?
MC: Oh, she was... No, no, she married a black man. She married the blackest she could get...
ED: Yes, but did she call herself a Negro? Or did she consider, act as if she was white marrying a...
MC: Oh, no, no.
ED: She was a Negro. Like your father.
MC: Yes. That's right.
ED: They didn't deny their mother's heritage.
MC: No.
ED: And now that's five. How about the other six brothers and sisters?
MC: That I do not know.
ED: Isn't it interesting what has happened to our race? Stories upon stories.
MC: Yes, that's right.
ED: But it's interesting to hear one right from the source. Now that straightens that out. You and Dr. Chester Chinn. He was an eye specialist. Pardon me, is he living?
MC: No, he died. He died last fall.
ED: Oh, that recently? You and he were not related but you did, at one time, practice together, did you not?
MC: We practiced together. He lived at our house, and we had our signs together on the door.
ED: I see. Dr. May Chinn, Dr. Chester Chinn. Now I remember that office. Tell me, the north side of 125th Street?
MC: No, no. Our offices were at 44 Edgecombe Avenue. This was my first office.
ED: Was Dr. Chinn... You weren't on 125th?
MC: That's later, dear, that's much later.﻿12
ED: I see. Were you both there on 125th, or did...just he went down?
MC: No, no. Between 44 Edgecombe, when we practiced together, Chester got a fellowship to Germany, and he went to Germany and specialized in ear, eye, nose and throat. Now, he came back to...and he wanted an office on 125th Street and Seventh Avenue. Now in the meantime—you see, Chester had married in the meantime—he had his two children, and his wife went back to her home in West Virginia with the children. The last year that he was there, she went to Germany, and they came back together, and they lived up at the Dunbar. That was their home.
ED: Mm hmm, Dunbar Apartments.
MC: I was able to get that office where he practiced, at 125th Street and Seventh Avenue, because he wanted it, but he had said he always wanted to practice there- So during the time that...I was trying to negotiate to get it, and I finally got the place for him. You see, when he was with me, he was doing general medicine, just like everybody else, you see, when we first started. And it was only that he got this fellowship to go to Germany that he specialized. And when he came back, he took the qualifying board for ear, eye, nose and throat, and he was the only Negro in America that had the four specialties. They had happened to the point where they would only give one specialty—eye; you were a specialist in ear; a specialist in nose... But he was the only Negro that had the four specialties, because he took the examinations as soon as he came back. So that was that.
ED:
MC: ED:
MC:
MC:
ED: MC:
Well, that's an interesting story for the black men oral history^project. [laughter] We'll continue on with your side of the story. Let s see now, we're in Great Barrington, we're out of Great Barrington, we re in New York. We have dealt with your remarkable mother, who saw to it that at an early age, she didn't want you growing up in a home...
In the squalid neighborhood that we lived in.
Where did you move to when you came to New York? Do you know the first address?
Yes. This will be in my book. Down on Twenty-seventh Street, near the*East River. And I think it describes it. Does it describe it
in here. ED: In the article, right.
Yes And it was because of the alcoholic situation, and the squalor, that she decided to get me out of it, and I went to Bordentown.
You are very grateful to her, aren't you?
And then when I went there, I developed this osteomyelitis of the face, and...
ED: At the school?﻿13
MC: At the school. And fortunately for me, there was a very fine surgeon that had a private hospital near the school, and he took me over as his patient. Now, he was... This will be in my book, as I said. He was very tall, lean and lanky, and he had scars on his face, I think three or four scars. He had had a similar condition when he was young. He had fallen off a bicycle and fractured the bone, and got an infection in it, and this was why he was so interested in me, you see.
ED: Your myelitis... Is that what it was called?
MC: Osteomyelitis.
ED: ...had left a mark on your face?
MC: No, that was from the operations. You see, in those days, they didn't have antibiotics. And they had to treat it by scraping and packing.
ED: The bone?
MC: The bone, that's right. And I had a through and through hole that... the packing was between my mouth and the other... And I wore this bandage around my... Had to keep the packing...
ED: You'd never know it today, would you?
MC: Well, I've had plastic [surgery] done since that time.
ED: Well, you certainly would never know that...
MC: Yes. Dr. Crump did this plastic.
ED: This is what aroused his interest, when he saw you with this condition?
MC: That's right. And then...
ED: Now how long did you stay in this school in New Jersey? In what city in New Jersey?
MC: It's near Bordentown. I think it was Bordentown.
ED: Oh, yeah, Bordentown. We did establish that..
MC: See, in those days, when you were sick with a thing like...you were not acutely ill, you were chronically ill. Some days you felt good, some days you didn't, so, some days they'd have to bring my food to me, and it became quite a problem for the school. So my mother finally took me out. And this thing finally did heal. Then we went... Then she got a job, a sleep-in job with the Tiffany family, Tiffany jewelers— I don't know whether...
ED: Yes, you mentioned that. Is that the Tiffany's that we all know, on Fifty-seventh Street?﻿14
MC:	That's right, that's right.
ED:	And where was that, upstate somewhere?
MC:	That was upstate. Tarrytown___what's that; someplace up there.
ED:	Tarrytown.
MC:	Yes, somewheres up there. Mr. Davis has even been up there to check.
ED:	Are there descendants of that family? Oh, I guess there are Tiffanys.
MC:	There are descendants of that family.
ED:	What a wonderful researcher.
MC:	And he's traced the family to their present descendants. He is the
most remarkable person,
ED: When the book comes out, all the Tiffanys will be interested in reading it, too, [laughter] to know this famous woman doctor.
MC: Well, I asked him, I said, "Well, why are you doing all..." He said, "Well, you know, anything that is put in print, you can be sued about, so we want to be able to substantiate everything you say, so that if we're sued, we give them the reference, you see. Let them look it up themselves." He said, "We don't want to run into what Haley ran into," you see.
ED: Right. Did you stay there, how many years of your younger life, do
you think? As a matter of fact, when you left the school, do you remember how old you were? You went there about five or six.
MC: Yes. Well, I remember this, that it was the second school that I went
to. Evidently the first school that I went to was in Pauling, New York. My mother was in service there, and it was that one...famous school in which you have a large-bellied stove, and the girls sit on one side and the boys...
ED: The one-room schoolhouse?
MC: That's right, one-room school. That's what I'm trying to say.
ED: So that was probably a little girl in kindergarten, wasn't it? If that was your first school...
MC: Yes, it quite possibly was, yes. Now, be good enough to ask the question again.
ED: Oh. When you went to New Jersey, to Bordentown, maybe you were about seven or eight then, right?
MC: Well, when I came back to New York... Let me see... It's so hard to﻿15
MC: (cont.) get these... He finally got this thing, all this straightened out.
ED: Well, for those who do research on your life, then, they can get the
details of the exact dates in your book. I think what we're interested in here is, as a little girl living in this house in Tarrytown, with the Tiffanys...
MC: Well, you see, as I said in the story, that I lived like one of the children.
ED: Yes. And you were probably a young preadolescent, weren't you? Probably about nine?
MC: No, not that old. Much younger than that, yes.
ED: Probably about eight or nine.
MC: They used to come to New York on Saturday mornings. They would go to the circus, to the Hippodrome, to the Walter Damrosch concerts— I remember those so well.
ED: The ones in the park? The Damrosch concerts...
MC: No, no. No, no. They were at one of the small music halls, in Fifty-
seventh Street, I think, or one of the concert halls. But in the morning, he had this group of children that came from all over, and he taught us the classics, you know, at that time. And of course, in between, we had studies. And then they had a governess that taught them French and German, so I... And then I ate in the dining room with the children. The only times that I really was with my mother was when I slept. I slept in the room that she slept. And also, when the children came in the kitchen to help my mother with the vegetables—they loved my mother. And she would make these jars of cookies, you know. So that I was just another child in the house.
ED: It's a very interesting part of our history, isn't it? I've talked
with so many women who have said that their mothers in service, working in a home, and they were part of the family. And it's where they got much of their learning, many of their values, many of their understandings about home life and also--- You got it, too.
MC: I got it, too, yes.
ED: Is this where your remarkable interest in music, which later developed into such a talent, began?
MC: Yes, with the Damrosch thing.
ED: Coming to the concerts?
MC: That's right.﻿16
ED: Now, at what stage did you begin to take piano lessons?
MC: Oh, I think I took piano lessons from about six or seven years, through the years.
ED: Up at Tarrytown?
MC: No, no, after we came back to New York and left the Tiffanys. See, the Tiffany head died, and the estate was finally broken up. So we had to come back to New York.
ED: You and your mother.
MC: Yes, and then at that time, my mother and father again lived together, you see.
ED: I see. Where was he during the time that you were upstate? Just down in New York City?
MC: Down in New York, and just couldn't get a job. He was a Negro, and he was proud of it, and he couldn't get a job. So he would get little jobs...
ED: Suffering what males suffered so strongly.
MC: That's right. Messengers, or something like that.
ED: Did you all live in the lower East Side, again, your mother, you, and your father?
MC: No, no. As I remember, we lived at San Juan Hill at one time, back of Lincoln Center, that area.
ED: Oh, on the West Side, the sixties.
MC: Yes, we never went East again, we were	always on the West Side. Then
at one time we lived right across from Central Park, at Columbus Circle.
There was a small... Then we moved up	to —
ED: That was a heavily Negro area then, wasn't it?
MC: Very... Well, you see, what happened was, my mother would move wherever there was a good school. That was the one thing that she insisted, that I found out later. That wherever there was a good school, and they were just beginning to open up for Negroes, she would move there and, because there were still white children in that school, therefore it was a good school. And that's the way that we lived. And we lived at 101st Street.
ED: Always coming up.
MC: Yes. And I finally graduated from grammar school, from the P.S. 93 that was on the corner of Amsterdam Avenue and Ninety-third Street. It has﻿17
MC: (cont.) finally been abandoned. I mean it's...there's a development there now, so that's gone.
ED: Yes. Near there, they built a junior high school, Joan of Arc, somewhere on those grounds.
MC: Yes, that's right. Well, and after I had finished grammar school, they had just...
ED: Pardon me. P.S. 93 was your grammar school, right?
MC: P.S. 93 was the grammar school. They had just built Washington Irving
High school downtown—I think it was either Sixteenth or Fourteenth Street there. Well, I got in the first year there.
ED: It was a very good high school, Washington Irving High School. It still is.
MC: Yes. And then, because the travel was so great, you see, we moved to the Bronx, because Morris High School then was the high school, it was a coed, girls and boys there. And so, since the travel was so long, she moved to the Bronx in order that...to go to this one.
ED: Your remarkable mother.
MC: Oh, I really didn't...
ED: You know, the unsung heroines are these mothers and fathers who made it possible for their children, in the face of so much discrimination and all the problems, always with this goal', My child shall have a good education. And the sacrificing that they did personally...
MC: That's right, that's right.
ED: Your mother comes through as a truly great woman.
MC: Oh, she really was most remarkable.
ED: So she moved to have you near Morris High School, as she had moved before. Wow!
MC: And then I dropped out of high school, you know.
ED: I saw that in the write-up- [laughter] Maybe a fortuitous happening. And that was your last year, wasn't it, that you had—was it a disappointed love affair, and a poor grade in Latin or something?
MC:	That's right, that's right.
ED:	And you just dropped out.
MC:	I just dropped out.
ED:	Did you go to work?﻿18
MC: Yes, and in the meantime, I was teaching children, kindergarten children, piano. You see, having studied it all these years. So I was making a little money, and quite happy, you see. I didn't have to worry about Latin any more! [laughs]
ED: Yes. Now, I want to get this music training in. All along, from after Tarrytown days, first the music... It's probably, you know, inborn.
MC:	Yes. Well, anyway...
ED:	Were either your mother or father musical?
MC:	My father couldn't read a note, but he could play a violin.
ED:	Self-taught! Any music on your...
MC:-	Any music at all. If he heard a tune, he could reproduce it on his violin.
ED:	How about your mother, any music?
MC:	My mother sang a very beautiful contralto voice. Very beautiful. She couldn't read a note.
ED: Now- Piano lessons started, probably, when you came back to New York, right?
MC: Yes, that's right.
ED: And continued. Your mother, what, did she scrape, really, to pay for these piano lessons, or wasn't it that...
MC: Well, that was a part of educating your child, you see, and we studied with a Negro woman who was an aristocrat. She was very particular. Her name was Mary Lee. Nobody remembers her, but she was a wonderful person.
ED: In her home, she taught you?
MC: Both. In addition to that, in order to support her school, she would give these little musicals, and since I sang and played, I was quite frequently the star.
ED:	You sang also! What voice?
MC:	Let's see. Lyric soprano.
ED:	Lyric soprano.
MC:	Yes, lyric soprano. But it was a natural, for me.. I loved it, you see.﻿19
ED:
ED
ED
ED:
ED:
This is side two of the interview with Dr. May Chinn. You were saying that you were a lyric soprano.
MC: Yes.
And that it came naturally, and that you loved it.
MC: Yes, yes.
Now, did you also tell me that, this year that you dropped out of school, you were teaching children piano? Teaching music.
MC: Yes, that's right.
ED: What? What were you teaching them? The piano, and singing?
MC: No, just piano, and then I was also teaching them little skits like my teacher Mary Lee was doing. So that these little skits would be performed in their church, or at the YMCA, or some little social event, and they... So, I was really very busy.
ED: Of course. You were too busy to go to school.
MC: That's right.
ED: How did your mother look on this?
MC: Well, my mother was grieved, because her one idea was that she wanted me to have an education. One woman that she had worked for was a schoolteacher, and my mother told me years afterwards that this teacher had said to her one day, "You give that girl all the education you can. You'll be proud of her someday." Now, I didn't know that until after I finished medicine. So that was her drive, that I get a good education.
ED: Who had said this to her?
MC: One of the women that my mother did day work for, who was a schoolteacher. And that's how it was.
ED: And she carried this burning desire.
MC: Now, how I got back into school was this...
Just let me ask you one thing. You spoke when we were off tape of, you think you gave a lesson to the person who has become my dearest friend, Muriel Snowden, who was then Muriel Sutherland, from New Jersey?
MC: Yes, that's right. And I think it was for some little concert in the church that she belonged to.
Over in Glen Ridge.
MC: That's right.﻿20
ED: And you went over and rehearsed that little group. Was she a small child?
MC: Yes. There were several small children. And I was surprised, myself. You know, it was a matter of making little costumes for them, and things like that.
ED: Yes. Did you sew also?
MC: Well, my mother did. You see, she made over the clothes that people gave her, that she worked for. Or she picked up little remnants and made me a little dress, or something like that. And she would do that when she would come home.
ED: In a sense,	in your home, and probably countless others that we don't
know about,	it was like a little tiny community center, in a sense,
wasn't it?	The passing on of tradition and talents from within the
confines of	the walls of yoyr home, and even spreading further. So that that's part of our heritage, isn't it?
MC: Yes. Mm hmm.
ED: So you taught these little children to sing and to dance, and to be in skits. And when I talk to Muriel Snowden, who is also one of the women on this advisory committee on which we both serve, for this
project___ And in addition to that, Muriel Sutherland Snowden, the
cofounder of Freedom House, has been interviewed, as one of the notable black women whose story will be also in the Schlesinger Library. You became her doctor, and delivered her child?
MC: That's right.
ED: So again, the circle constantly grows. So. This was a year out of school, your mother was disappointed, but she supported you, in the sense of your projects, didn't she? She stood behind you, I mean, in your little...
MC: Well, her aim was to try to get me to go back to school. And I have...
ED: How did she manifest this aim?
MC: Well, it was very interesting. I was a member of Saint Philip's Church, I had been confirmed, and I taught Sunday school to the kindergarten.
ED:	At my church, Saint Philip's. Was Father Bishop there then?
MC:	That's right.
ED:	The father, or the son?
MC:	No, the father.
ED:	The father, Shelton Hale Bishop, Sr.﻿21
MC: That's right. And the___ Oh, let me see. I've lost my train of
thought.
ED: I'm sorry. You taught at the church. I asked you, how did your mother manifest her...
MC: Oh, yes. Well, what happened was that they had at that time a daily vacation Bible school in the summer. One of my dear friends was the principal, and she asked me to be one of the teachers with another girl. So the three of us had charge of the daily vacation Bible school at Saint Philip's in the summer- So my mother knew that the girl that was the principal was going to Teachers College* on a scholarship. Now the scholarship was given to her by a very wealthy white woman that her mother did the laundry for. And I can remember being at her house sometimes and finding the chauffeur coming up with this large basket of linen and leaving it at this girl's mother's house, and taking another back, laundry that was finished. So my mother knew this girl was in college, and so she got to talk to her, and she said, "Why don't you take May over to college sometime, and see if she can't get in." Well, I didn't have a high school diploma. So at that time, you had to have a high school or an equivalent. So they suggested that I take an examination. I took an examination, thinking maybe I'd get two or three points, you know, a commission for that. I took the exam, and very much to my surprise, they admitted me, as a full matriculated student, with twenty-one points. Can you imagine that?
ED: Wow! No.
MC: Well, of course, you can imagine how excited I was beginning to become, you see.
ED: Your ability was showing.
MC: Well, I don't know, but I registered in music. There was a question of whether or not I would... After I became excited about this, there was a question of whether I would try for Juilliard School of Music or Teachers College. So Mother and I talked it over, and we decided that a college degree in music may mean more than just coming from a music school.
ED: I see. So you took the liberal arts course, probably, didn't you?
MC: Wait a minute.
ED: Oh. [laughter]
MC: Yes, I did.
ED: With a major in music?
* at Columbia University﻿22
MC: Major in music, that's right*
ED; And education, too? To teach music, or...,
MC: Well, I'll come to that a little bit later.
ED: Sorry. I get anxious when I hear this...
MC: Anyhow, I took the exam. But what happened was, my program was planned, but I needed one more point. I had twenty points. So it was decided that I take a lecture course. Now, this lecture course meant that you took one lecture a week, and then at the end of the term, you were assigned a paper. At least, you were assigned the paper early, but you worked on it, and at the end of the year, instead of taking an examination, you handed in this paper. And I had been assigned sewage disposal—that was the name of the thing that I was supposed to do. So, of course, at the end of the term, I handed my paper in. And about three days later—this story will be in George's story—I got this note from the lecturer, asking me if I had the time, would I come by her office? So I went by, and she said, "I just wanted to meet you," she said. "I never heard of a music major writing a paper like this on sewage disposal." So I said, "It was interesting." And she sat down and chatted with me, and talked, and talked so friendly with me. And I was having some trouble with one of the professors—I don't know whether this is in this story or not. And he was a German. And evidently he hated to have a Negro, which he only associated with syncopation and jazz, be in his class studying Bach and Schubert, and all these other people. And so he made life very unhappy for me. There were eleven men in the class, and I was the only woman and the only Negro in the class. So he made life very miserable. So you see, I was at the point... As she talked, she said, "Well, if you ever make up your mind, if you decide to change your major, I think you have a future in science. So," she said, "you think about it." So, here was my release. So I talked it over with my mother, and she said...
ED: Release from this man, and having to take more courses under him.
MC: Yes. I would have had to take four or five courses with him, to complete my work for my degree.
ED: Did he assign you that title, "Sewage Disposal?" Was that assigned by him?
MC: No, that was assigned by this lecturer, this woman lecturer see. No, he was wholly in the music department. So I went to,..my second year, I changed over to science. Now, in the meantime, I had been teaching... I had been accompanying the students in the music department, I had been working, interestingly enough, with Chinese students there. Because, you see, their musical scale is different than ours. It's a half a note, rather than the full. You know, we have half notes. But all of their scale is half notes. And they have difficulty being on, keeping on pitch. So I worked with them, as a student. Got little pay for it. I got paid for accompanying them. So I was making a little﻿23
MC: (cont.) money there. And when I went over to science, they still asked me to do this, and they gave me my singing lessons free.
ED: Oh, isn't that— At the school? And this was still at...
MC: At Teachers College.
ED: Still at Teachers College. So you switched from the music major to the science major.
MC: That's right. And then in addition to that, she saw that I had a
student's job with her, and I got paid forty cents an hour. Any number of hours that I could put in, I got forty cents.
ED: Were you enterprising by nature, or was this the necessity from the struggle of your mother making a living?
MC: I don't know whether it was either one of those. All that I know, that once I got my teeth in it, I just became eager to know more.
ED: No, I mean the little jobs. You had the little job —
MC: Oh, no, no. Oh, money, I had to have...
ED: But was this a realization of the facts of life—you know, you knew
your mother worked hard for money, and you had to kind of help, or were you just by nature an enterprising person?
MC: It goes back a little further than that. My father objected to me
going to college, number one, as I think you read here in this book. His idea of a girl was that you got married and had children. See, he was a different generation. A girl that went to college became a queer woman. She didn't act like a woman. And he didn*t want to be the father of a queer girl. So he gave nothing toward me going to college. So that after I got a taste of this thing of college, then I had to have more of the same. I had to work, you see.
ED: You found you loved learning.
MC: I loved it. That's it.
ED: Well, your high intelligence was finding expression.
MC: Well, I don't know that, but I knew that I was eager to know. But everything that I did, the strange thing, seemed to be a very natural step for me. I mean, my getting back into college, I was delighted. Now my only fear there was that I could not possibly make enough money with my mother to go into the next year. So I decided to make as much of that year as I could, you see. And so that I could at least say that I had two years of college, or three years of college, you see. But with all forces working together, with my mother, myself, and Dr. Broadhurst putting things in my way—she created jobs for me. Not only that, but she also saw that I took some out-of-college studies, that I got college﻿24
MC: (cont.) credit for.
ED: Oh, at another place?
MC: At another place, at postgraduate school in New York, where they were teaching clinical pathology, tissue work, and things of that sort. So that when I came out, I could get a job in that field, which was a brand new field.
ED: Now this was not in medical school? This was still in college?
MC: No, this was in college, at Teachers College. This was between 1917 and 1921, when I got my degree.
ED:	What was her name? Helen Broadhurst?
MG-:	Dr. Jean Broadhurst.
ED:	Jean Broadhurst. Did she have a sister who was in education, too?
MC:	I'm not sure.
ED:	The name is ringing a bell as the one who was...
MC:	Do you remember Stackpole?
ED:	I remember the name.
MC:	Yes, Miss Stackpole and Jean Broadhurst had their classrooms opposite..,. Stackpole was in biology, and Jean Broadhurst was in bacteriology.
ED: I see. The name Broadhurst is ringing a bell for me in education, I
thought in the private school system—a Helen Broadhurst? I'll have to look that up, but it just struck a bell. But I know I've heard her name as a great educator.
MC: Now the interesting thing about this, that I had a job before I finished my fourth year. In other words, there was a job at the old Fifth Avenue Hospital. They needed a technician in this very thing that I had been studying. So she advised me to finish my work at night, the college work, and I took the job. So I...
ED: You mean, to go to night school for your last year at Teachers College?
MC: That's right. And I finished with my class.
ED: Is that so? Even going nights? How could you get in enough..,.
MC: Well, you see, what happened was, you see, I worked with her during the summer, you see. When I was in school in the day at Teachers College, in many classes, I was the only Negro. But in the summertime, Columbia was practically a college campus.﻿25
ED: So many came up from the South.
MC: That's right, from the South. And I worked with her during the summer, so I got salary there.
ED: And extra credits, also.
MC: Extra credits, that's right.
ED: So you finished with your class even though you went to night school and worked in the daytime. Where was old Fifth Avenue Hospital?
MC: At that time, it was at, if I can remember, Sixty-sixth or Sixty-fifth Street. It was a private hospital at that time, and very near Rockefeller Institute. It was just beyond Third Avenue, because I remember that I'd have to walk under the Third Avenue el to get there. But I became a technician there, and I stayed at that job until I entered medical school.
ED: So you worked summers. So you didn't have too much vacation, did you?
MC:	Oh, practically no vacation, at all.
ED: You were blessed with good health, weren't you?
MC: Yes. After I got over this osteomyelitis, I was.
ED: Because you had to really...your mother and you carried heavy loads.
MC: That's right. Well, my mother...! remember Dr. Janeway, the person
that was taking care of me at his own sanitarium, the last thing, one of the last things he said to my mother was, he said, "You spend the rest of her life getting her...fatten her up." Because I was skin and bones after I'd had this protracted illness. I was sick about two years with this thing, you know.
ED: He said, "Fatten her up." What was your mother's build?
MC: My mother was short, and chunky. She was about five feet, two inches, and rather stout.
ED: And your height is what?
MC: I'm five feet, four inches.
ED: But good health.
MC: Yes.
ED: Because, with no vacations, working nights, going to school, and I think when we get on to medical school, we will hear how you..,
MC: I worked there. I worked there, too.﻿26
ED: This walking from Harlem. Where were you living now? Harlem or...
MC: Well, after I was admitted to Teachers College, then we moved to 138th Street and Seventh Avenue.
ED: Oh, yes. The corner?
MC: On the corner, there. The house is still there.
ED: It's still there. Which corner, can you remember?
MC: Yes, it was the northeast corner, and across the street from there, believe it or not, was a great farm with goats on it.
ED: Is that on 138th Street? Well, then the houses had not been built,
the William Stanley White houses, vhich are now part of Striver's Row.
MC: No. Oh, yes, they bad, but that was 139th Street.
ED: Oh, 139th. But 138th had some beautiful houses.
MC: Yes, they did, but that was on the other side of Seventh Avenue.
ED: Oh yes, I see, going towards... Yes. You were talking about the goat farms, going towards...
MC: They had goats, and it was a vegetable farm.
ED: Isn't that something. It's hard to imagine, isn't it? Now this is in 1917?
MC: It was between 1917 and 1921.
ED: So World War I was taking place while you were in Teachers College.
MC: That's right, that's right. Because the first year, as I remember, we were... We could take emergency courses. "For instance, one of the courses I took was automobile repair, and posters, making posters. These were given free...
ED: To help with the war effort.
MC: And then I sang for the soldiers. Then had the USO [United Service
Organizations], and the colored soldiers had their...so I used to go down there. Occasionally we would go out to the camps and sing for them there.
ED: Were you part of a choral group, or was this just an informal group?
MC: No, these are all from college.
ED: Oh, going from the college.
MC: Yes, that's right.﻿27
ED: Did the college have a choral group?
MC: They may have, but I didn't belong to it.
ED: The prejudice you suffered doesn't seem to have evidenced itself in bitterness, though. You don't find bitterness in you.
MC: The funny thing is, the strange thing of it is, I don't know where I got this from, but I had an expression that I made that, |:I learned to live with white people."
ED: Mmm, that's a sound remark.
MC: My feeling was that people should meet on a friendly basis, accept
you for what you were. Now, if they couldn't do that, I wasn't going to urge them to take me in their circle. I would go on my own way. And I found out that it worked out pretty well. Because what happened was that they were sort of intrigued, the fact that I didn't need them, that I got along without them.
ED: So when they discriminated against you, and made it hard for you, you went on, on your own way, and then...
MC: Then they came over to me. And some of them became very close friends, very close friends.
ED: But you could hold your head high.
MC: That's right.
ED: Would you pass that advice on to young people today? In 1979, would it still work?
MC: I think that... Yes. In other words, I think I manifested some independence. Although I didn't think of it that way, it s just that I didn't feel that I should go out of my way to win them.
ED: Yes, but now, when a door is specifically closed in your face, let's
say... Let's just have a "for instance," let's say you needed... Well, 'course it shows in your life when you couldn't practice in the hospitals. Later in life, you went with the surgeon into the homes, didn't you?
MC: That's right. We operated in the patient's home, yes.
ED: So that you didn't let the obstacle stop you.
MC: No.
ED: And you didn't, as it's done in the sixties and the seventies, march against it, at this point. You went on with what you had to do.
MC: That's right. The only march that I made was, two. One was, I have a picture of myself marching in the suffragette parade down Fifth Avenue,﻿28
ED: Oh, really? When was that, about 1921, or so? Were you in college? In medical school?
MC: I was still in college. No, I was at college. Before '21. And then
I took the March on Washington, because I was interested in the movement, although I was... Just to fill in the number—you know what I mean? I had the faith that we should let the world know that things were not as they thought it, that we were not really a full citizen, as far as our rights was concerned. But I mean, I didn't go out and blow a horn, or carry a banner—I may have carried a banner, I don't know—but my philosophy was that, "I can go on without you, and I won't move you. I won't make any attempt to win you."
ED: And, "I will make it in spite of you. I will make it."
MC: I never thought of it that way. I just felt that that was the decision, that that was the thing to do. You know, I didn't verbally say to myself that, "I will show you." You know, some people say, "Well, I'm going to show you what I can do." But my feeling was that that was the way to do it, that you didn't force yourself into any situation, you just carried on with what you had.
ED: Where do you think this came from?
MC: Well, I don't know. That I don't know because, as I say, I really
don't know. You see, my mother was a person of a very few words, but she always supported me. She was always there. Now my father, as I said, he was away from... We lived together, as a family, but he lived away from me, because he didn't approve of me going to school.
ED: Yes, your independence.
MC: Now, the one thing that he did do, he did assume the responsibility of carrying as much of the rent as he could. I mean, that was one thing that he prided himself on.
ED: A house over the head.
MC: That's right, house over the head.
ED: That's my job—keep the house, keep the roof over the head.. Roof over the house, rather.
MC: That's right. And my mother schemed a little bit for insurances for me.
She didn't have money for herself, but she had one for me. And she had one on my father, you know what I mean? They worked together in that way.
ED: But your mother here, you're saying... It seems to me—I don't want to put words in your mouth—you had this philosophy, but in a way it was her philosophy, too.
MC: It really was, a very different thing.﻿29
ED: MC:
ED:
MC:
I mean, you kind of picked up some of it from her... You made it, so.. As I look back on our life, I always feel that my mother lived through
me.
Yes. And gloriously, 'cause she must have. Well, how old were you when she died?
MC: She died in... Let me see, I was, must have been about... It was
when I moved up to 409, so I had my office there. I think I moved up there in '42, and she died two years after we were there, so that was '44.
ED: But you had been practicing at 44 Edgecombe?
MC: That's right.
ED: And then, from 44 to 409, or did you go to 125th Street?
No, no... From 44 to 409. I went up there in '42, and she died two years afterward. So she died in '44, so that meant that, 1944, I was,
ED: Forty, fifty years old. Forty-eight years old. Well now, she therefore did get to see this only child, this daughter, a successful physician.
MC: Interesting thing, my father finally got to be proud of me. That's
another long story. He ignored the fact that he was my father, although we lived together. You know, because he still had that idea that a woman that was not married, that was in medicine, was an odd woman. And he did not want to be known as the father of such a child. Now, when he got to recognize me was in a very strange way. My father finally got a job as a watchman in one of the banks in New York. This story will be with, in George's book, so... I had been practicing about two years when one of my father's friends, who worked also with the bank, said to me, "Have you met the president of the bank, the chairman of the bank?" And I said, "No, I haven't." And he said, "Well, you know, he's been after your father to bring you to town so he could meet you." And so I finally said to my father, "I understand that the president of the bank wants me to come down, and he's asked you." "Oh," he said,
"he didn't... Well---" I said, "Now, if you don't take me down, I'll
go myself." So he decided he would take me down. Now, as we walked over the man's doorstep, the president of the bank got up and came to me and shook my hand, and he says, "I'm so proud of you." And he said to my father, "Why didn't you let me know that you had a daughter in medical school?" He said, "I'm on the board of two or three medical schools and hospitals, and I could have been... We have funds so that we can do things for a deserving student." Well, my father was speechless.
ED: Oh, what a story!
MC: When he went back out of the door with me, his head was up like this.
And from that point on, William Chinn was the father of Dr. May Chinn. And he was a great twirler of a cane, and he wore a derby, and oh, he﻿30
MC: (cont.) was proud. He was Dr. Chirm's father. Now, that's a fact. But could you imagine the...
ED: Yes, he had to get that... He had to find out from somebody else.
MC: But can you imagine what expense my mother would have been saved?
ED: Of course. Oh, what do we call it? What is it? We want to say male chauvinism, but that's, that's a modern-day term for...what is it? He couldn't... Well, it was just his strong... And he wasn't alone.
MC: No, absolutely.
ED: I made a note here when you said, "He didn't want to be the father of a daughter who did this kind of thing, because that was queer for women to..."
MC: That's right.
ED: How did you carry, handle that burden?
MC: Well, again, as I learned how to live with white people, I learned how to live with him. I never crossed him, and I didn't urge him, or I didn't do anything.
ED: You just went on.
MC: I just went on.
ED: So you were almost born, or you developed or something, a great deal of independence, didn't you, from the very start, willing to go on and do what you... Would you have called yourself, at any point, stubborn?
MC: I don't think so.
ED: Doesn't seem like it to me. I'm trying to...
MC: My father and I had no arguments at all, it's just that, as George has mentioned in his article, that after I wouldn't marry this Greek, you know, the first romance...
ED: ...that your father wanted you to marry.
MC: Yes. Well, that was his solution for a woman. You got married and you had children, and that was the end of you.
ED: And you were able to say no to your father.
MC: Oh, we were so horrified. Now, it happened, believe it or not, that this Greek that had this vegetable store, had three children. And he was a widower, and I would play with these children after school. So you can imagine the shock it was to me when he came over and asked for me in marriage. In other words, he wanted a mother for his children.﻿31
MC: (cont.) So, as I said, the whole thing was so shocking. And at that point, my father just washed his hands completely of me. He hardly spoke with me.
ED: From that day on, didn't speak. So it wasn't a matter of being a difficult thing for you to do, it was just unheard of. I mean, it was no question of your being willing to do it.
MC:	See, my mother, all she wanted me to do was to have an education, you
know.
ED:
Yes, and all he wanted you to do was have a husband. And she won out, didn't she, and helped by you, of course, because you...
MC:	Well, I got so interested, as I said, with the fact that I... Fortunately,
since I had to work to stay in school, I couldn't get clothes to go to parties with my friends. We would have little affairs at our own home. And my home was an open home, in that my mother cooked so well, and she always had this jar of cookies. So these kids would run up and always get cookies, and they'd chat with Mother, they'd do little things for her, you know. So our house was an open house, that kind of thing.
ED:	Was your father in the house all along? Did your mother and father
stay together from that point on?
MC:	From that point on, they did. But you see, when she was working in
service, he stayed in New York City.
ED:	Right. And once she came back...
MC:	But he visited us there. He came up to the---
ED:	So it was a kind of a relationship.
MC:	Yes. There was a certain loyalty that they had.
ED:	They didn't jump off and get a divorce real quick like they do nowadays.
MC:	Oh, no. Well, the funny thing is, things were so difficult at one time
that, there was a period of time of a year that Mother and I would, after going through one of these weekend bout things, that we would just decide well, "We can't take it any longer. Let us move out." But the funny thing is, neither Mother or I decided the same week that that was the thing to do. You know, I would say, "Well, I'm going out." And Mother said, "Well, I'm going to stay." And it was the opposite. So the Chinn family stayed together. We learned to live. Mother and I learned how to avoid these bad scenes, you see. And my father finally stopped drinking, you know.
ED:	Is that so? At what point in his life?
MC:	Well, now, that's another long story.﻿32
ED:	Okay, let's hold it here for just a moment. Let's see if the tape
has run out.
ED:	Here we are, back again, after having had some lunch. You were saying
about your father stopping drinking?
MC: Yes. Well, my father developed a very severe illness, and at his age, he needed surgery. He had a ruptured appendix, which was diagnosed at the operating room table, and a very prolonged convalescence. Now during this convalescence, it was a matter of teaching my mother what kind of food he should have, and I myself feeding him whenever I got a chance. Because my father prided himself on his appearance, I even shaved him with his straight razor. And that was really quite an innovation. But we became very close because I did these personal things for him, and he looked forward to it. So that during that period of time, we developed a very warm relationship. And the interesting thing was, when he got well enough to return to work, which he insisted upon doing, because they were still holding his job open for him...
ED:	Was this at the bank?
MC:	This was at the bank. He was a night watchman at the bank...that he
never drank any more. And now, occasionally, he would take a little wine that my mother made out of corn. She was very resourceful, and she used everything, you know. But we developed a beautiful relationship, daughter and father, and at his death it was really quite a loss to me to have lost him.
ED:	That's a beautiful story. And you had no resentment?
MC:	I had no, what?
ED:	You had no resentment toward him, at all the nonencouragement that he
gave you? Because you understood, I suppose. My mother-in-law used to say, the key to living is understanding. That when you understand something...
MC:	Yes, exactly. Well, we were able to speak with each other, understand
each other, you know.
ED:	Yes, and you knew why he objected to your becoming a doctor. Because
it came out of his whole conditioning.
MC: That's right.
ED:	He wanted a daughter who did the traditional...
MC:	There was one other reason—you want to tell me.., The other reason
was that when he was in Massachusetts... We found this out later....﻿33
ED:	After his death?
MC:	Since Mr. Davis did the trip. My father worked in a drugstore. Evi-
dently, when he finally reached Great Barrington, and he would deliver drugs, and he worked around the drugstore, people... He'd clean, and attended the soda fountain—in those days they had it. And my father said that the doctors of the neighborhood would come in where the pharmacist worked and say, "What would you give this patient? I don't know what's wrong with her." And so my father came to the conclusion that the doctors didn't know anything, that the pharmacists were the intelligent ones. And he did not want me to be that kind of a doctor. This was another reason that he was against me being... The doctors knew nothing, you see.
ED:	Oh, yes, so it was double. The whole female thing, and the doctors
knew nothing.
MC:	That's right.
ED:	I wonder how he would have felt had you decided to become a pharmacist.
MC:	Well, he probably... He would have...
ED:	He really wanted you to get married and have babies.
MC:	That is right. [laughter] There's nothing would substitute but for
that marriage.
ED:	Well, the traditional way of looking at it, right? How did you decide
to go... Oh, something I wanted to ask you. You mentioned your father's birthdate when we were off tape—1852?
MC: That's right, 1852.
ED:	So he was born in slavery time. And was — *52, '62, is ten years, '64,
he was twelve years old.
MC:	Eleven years old when he escaped.
ED:	Oh, I see. He escaped after the Civil War ended.
MC: No, no, before the Civil War, dear. The Civil War came the next year.,
ED: The Civil War was from 1860 to '64, wasn't it?
MC:	I think it began in 1863. There were rumors of it, if you remember,
but they actually went into battle, I think, in '63.
ED:	I see. And so therefore, he was around eleven.
MC: Yes, that's right.
ED:	And he escaped from slavery, ran away from it- And he was proud of
that, wasn't he?﻿34
MC: Oh, was he! He was very proud. ED:
MC
ED
MC:
You don't know his escape story, though, do you? There are so many interesting...
Oh, I do know the escape story, but, if you don't record this... ED: Well, is it going to be in the book? MC:	It's going to be in the book, yes.
ED: Oh, well, then, let's save it for our readers, in the book. MC: Yes, that's right.
Because, you know, there's a great deal of collecting of authentic escape stories now, because so many are fictional.
MC: Well, no, this is a real escape story. ED:	Oh, I'd love to hear it.
MC:
And how he, my father told me about it, you know that's very___I knew
nothing about it. My mother didn't know about this, I didn't know about it until I was in New York, and we went by a jockey sign—you know, these things that used to hold the, you attached your horse to, so that they would have to drag this metal thing.
ED: Yes.
MC: Well, my father was that kind of a servant in this place. And he would be dressed up in a white shirt, and a green jacket, and...
ED: Red pants, probably?
MC: Red cap. And I think the pants were white, something like that.
ED:	Yes, you're right. That's how they looked.
That was only when the family went for a carriage ride. Other than that, he helped the groom. He did the horses, and polished the harness, and things like that. And of course he was dressed...he had no shoes, you see... Oh, and by the way, that was the other thing, that when he... No, he didn't have shoes, that's right. But he never had shoes. But he was dressed up from... But around the stable yard, he was in just pants that had been worn by somebody else, that were frayed, and same thing with the shirt. So you see, when he dressed up, he was somebody, and that was one thing that followed my father through life. He was always beautifully groomed. And if you notice that picture, how his clothes fitted him. And as I say, he wore a derby, and he had this cane—mimicking his white people. But you see, that was a part of the﻿35
MC:	(cont.) contact that he had. But, as I say, with all of the slavery
thing, the thing that he was proudest of was the fact that he was able to escape and outwit these people. He escaped on one of the horses.
ED:	Really? I think you should tell it for the tape. But maybe not in
as great a detail as you do in the book.
MC: Well...
ED:	If you'd rather not, it's okay.
MC:	I'd rather not, because I want it to be a real story.
ED:	Want it to be in the book. Kind of a surprise, for those who will be...
Very good.
MC:	Not only that, but it also involved the fact that my father, when I was
a little girl, we had horse-drawn streetcars in New York. And one of the things was, was coming up from this Twenty-seventh Street, where we lived, way down in New York, wherever, to go up to the Claremont House that was on Broadway—you know, that was one of these stage places, where the very wealthy drove up there for dinner, and all this sort of thing. And there, my father, because he could handle horses, had stopped a runaway horse. And all the people at this inn was excited and praised him, and then somebody looked at him and decided that he was not white, and all the praise, in that few minutes, went down to pushing him aside.
ED:	And what age was he then?
MC:	It must have been... What age was I, or what age was he? As I say,
you'd have to add fifty-two to it. That must have been about, maybe, seven or eight years added to that. It was when we— It must have been before I went to Bordentown.
ED:	Oh, when you were a little girl.
MC:	Little girl, that's right. I can remember those trips, because that
was one of the things that, if he was not drinking, he would see that Sunday was a day for us, and that would be one of the trips. My mother would fix a nice luncheon for us and we would eat on this lawn up there. We wouldn't get into the place, of course.
ED:	So that brought back the bitter memory to him. I mean, that was a bitter
experience, when they thought that...
MC:	For him. Yes.
ED:	Yes, of course. Here he'd been living in relative freedom for a while,
and then to have someone judge him this way. Now, you know his date of birth. Do you know his date of death?
MC:	He was born in February.﻿36
ED: He was born in February, 1852. Do you know the date of his death? MC: It's on his death certificate. I'll have to get that for you. [1936]
ED:
MC:
ED:
MC:
ED MC
I just thought it might be interesting. How about your mother, do you know her birthdate?
Yes, I have hers, and hers is on her death certificate. They're in my safe.
Now, she was thirty years younger than he, so she was born probably in the eighties.
Yes, Eighty... Well, at any rate, the dates are there. I can give those to you 'cause I have them on their death certificates.
So she would be in her nineties if she were alive today. That' s right. My father would be a hundred and something, of course.
ED:	Yes, yes. How old was your mother when she died?
MC: She was sixty-six, I think.
ED:	Oh, same age as my mother. That's relatively young, isn't it?
MC: Yes. Well, she was a cardiac. This is why she tired so much. You know, I mean, she worked in the day, and if she could get laundry at night, she would do that. She would cater for parties, 'cause she was a beautiful cook, and she... There was a Jewish family that, she circulated among that family. If they had a dinner party, she would plan it, and serve it, and that sort of thing.
ED:	Where did she learn all of this? Because she married at the age of
sixteen, didn't she? Up in Great Barrington.
MC: That's right.
ED: We are taping Dr. May Chinn. And now our date is July 13. It's incidentally Friday, July 13. Are you superstitious?
MC: Not at all.
ED: Neither am I. And we are resuming from where we were in the last tape.
And so, to pick up there, Dr. Chinn, let's talk a little bit more about your years after graduation from high school. No, you didn't graduate from high school because...﻿37
MC:	No, that's right.
ED:	Let's talk about your early years In college, which was Teachers College,
and you entered in 1917, right? Were you the only Negro member of your class entering in 1917?
MC:	In the music department, I was... I took several courses. I was the
only Negro woman. There were white men, but I was the only Negro woman.
ED: Were there Negro men?
MC: No.
ED:	So you were the only Negro altogether. There were no Negro men and no
other Negro women.
MC: That's right.
ED:	How about in the school, in 1917? This is the year before the beginning
of World War I. In other parts of Teachers College, were there Negro persons?
MC:	There were many classes that I had in Teachers College in which I was
the only Negro student. This was in the daytime. Now in the summer, the campus was just flooded with Negro students, men and women, from the South. They came up for postgraduate work. I only took one or two courses in the summer, because I worked with Dr. Broadhurst during the day.
ED:	Oh, yes. We're going to get into that. I just wanted to get the compo-
sition for our researchers who will be using this material. You were the only Negro woman in the music school. Were there some other Negroes in other parts of Teachers College in the winter?
MC:	Oh, yes. Yes, that's right.
ED:	In the winter, not in the summer. But there were other students. Were
they fairly small in number?
MC:	Very small.
ED:	Were they mostly male or female? In the rest of Teachers College.
Negroes.
MC: They were, I think, mostly women.
ED:	Okay. Now. Well, I want to get back to that, maybe I'll ask you now.
Did you have any sense of loneliness?
MC:	No. I didn't have time to get lonely.
ED:	You were very busy. And was it in second year of college, or third year,﻿38
ED: (cont.) that you got the job through Dr. Broadhurst, Jean Broadhurst?
MC: The third year.
ED: And that job was...
MC: It was in clinical pathology, in one of the private hospitals in New York City, Flower Hospital.
ED: I think we did discuss that, on the other tape, when you were here last. That's the hospital that is now Flower Fifth.
MC: Yes.
ED: We'll move along. You got that job, as I recall, you told us on tape, and then in your fourth year, you worked full time at that job. So that was in your senior year.
MC: Yes. I got the job in my senior year. And I needed just a few points
to complete my year, and I took those points at night, so that I graduated with my class in 1921.
ED: Graduated with the same class, even though you switched to night school for just those few courses.
MC: That's right.
ED: You had taken courses in the summer, had you not?
MC: Yes. About one or two points, because I worked full time for Dr. Broadhurst during the summer as a student assistant.
ED: And took courses at the same time.
MC: That's right.
ED: So that you entered in 1917, and four years later you graduated with
your class, the class of 1921, from Teachers College, with a degree in science.
MC: Yes, that's right.
ED: Did you ever regret not having majored in music?
MC: No, because the music department gave me my singing lessons free. And
they also saw that I made a little extra money by playing accompaniments for students.
ED: Wonderful.
MC: So I was able to make a few little extra dollars at that time.﻿39
ED: Right. You have that same sense of industry that your mother had, didn't you, in terms of...
MC: I never thought of it that way, I was just interested and busy and loved what I was doing, you know. This is all that I can say. And of course, Mother was very happy that I was in college. That was the thing that was important.
ED: That was really the crowning achievement, as far as her life was concerned. Was she still working as hard as she had worked?
MC: Oh, yes.
ED: Was she holding more than one job to keep you in college?
MC: She worked as she got jobs. They were mostly domestic jobs. Sometimes I would wake up in the morning and find that she was doing somebody's laundry. She was serving dinner parties whenever she got a chance. It was a varied type of thing, but she was always very busy, and the only time that I remember that she really was at home was during the weekends, when she tried to rest. She would not go to a theater or a movie or anything like that. All she wanted to do was rest, whenever she got a chance. And I found out later that she was a cardiac, and she probably had a certain cardiac reserve that petered out with these long hours that she worked.
ED: We now are graduated from college. Did you continue at the clinical pathology job?
MC: Yes, I did.
ED: As a full-time job, now, with your degree?
MC: A full-time job, that's right.
ED: But you were Dr. May Chinn.
MC: No, no. Not at that time.
ED: Oh, wait a minute. This is from Teachers College.
MC: This was at the end...
ED: Tell us about the decision to go to medical school.
MC: Before that, Paul Robeson comes in, you remember? I had started accompanying Paul by accident when his accompanist didn't show at a... In those days, we were giving little concerts at the Y and little churches, and Paul was very much in demand. One day, we were on a program at the Young Men's Christian Association in New York City. I heard this voice say to me, "I understand that you're quite an accompanist. Would you mind accompanying me? Because it looks as though my accompanist is late," And of course I recognized the voice right away, and I said, "Of course, Paul." And so from that point on, we did little concerts whenever things﻿40
MC: (cont.) came up. So we both sang, and I played for myself—I mean I was my own accompanist, but I would accompany Paul.
ED: Now, when you graduated from college, did you do this before entering... Was there a period of time before you entered medical school?
MC: Yes. What happened was that I was offered... Flower Hospital at that time had a medical school attached to it, homeopathic medical school, and they offered me a full scholarship for four years in medicine, if I taught clinical pathology to the students. Of course, I was quite excited about it, so I went to Dr. Broadhurst to speak to her, ask her what would she do in a case like this. She said, "Well, if you're going to medical school, I would suggest that you go to an allopathic school, because a homeopathic is considered a 'B' school, and they are beginning to become less popular. And so that, if you are going to put in four years, put it into a allopathic school."
ED: How do you spell that?
MC: A-L-L-O-P-A-T-H-I-C. That may be wrong, but it's the spirit, anyway.
ED: And the difference between the two?
MC: Well, the homeopathic, the diagnostic procedure is the same, but they
prescribe a minute amount of drugs for treatment. While in the allopathic school, they use larger doses. I mean, that's the main difference in it. And the homeopaths used a great many herbs, while the allopathic would use hormones and metals and other things. They'd use herbs sometimes, but not as exclusively as the homeopathic did.
ED: I see. So she suggested that you not accept this offer?
MC: That's right. Well, she suggested if I was going to study medicine, to
apply to an allopathic school, which I did. And I applied to P & S, that's the medical school of Columbia.
ED: That's Physicians and Surgeons.
MC: Yes. And the other was at Bellevue, at New York University. It was called Bellevue Medical College at that time.
ED:	And was part of New York University?
MC:	Yes, that's right.
ED:	is it still?
MC:	ft ell, they've changed it now. The name now is New York University Medical College.
ED:	And is Bellevue the hospital associated with that?
MC:	Yes, it's a part...it was connected. We had our...material at﻿41
MC: (cont.) Bellevue Hospital. But at first it was called Bellevue Medical School, and then about five or six years later they changed it to New York University Medical School.
ED: I see. But it's still called Bellevue Hospital, isn't it?
MC: The hospital is different from the medical school, you see. We used
Bellevue Hospital and several other hospitals in New York for our clinical material. But the actual name of the college...
ED: ...was Bellevue Medical College, and then it was changed to New York
University. I see. And Bellevue is separate. It's one of the hospitals that is used.
MC: Yes.
ED: Interesting that the name is the same.
MC: Yes. Well, what happened was that I applied to both of these medical
schools, and P & S wanted me to take another course in chemistry during that summer, and if I passed the course, they would admit me. Now Bellevue, when I went in for the oral—this is another very long story.
ED: Well, I'm sure it's an interesting story.
MC: Well, anyhow, the story is this, that I had...my interview at Bellevue, the person that interviewed me was on the medical board, of course.
ED: Is this the interview where you later told Paul Robeson, "You are responsible for my..." It's a wonderful story.
MC: That's right.
ED: So that's why you took Bellevue over P & S that wanted you...
MC: Because I needed the money, you see. In other words, that six weeks, I needed money for my admission.
ED: Rather than to be taking the chemistry course. Oh, there was a question I wanted to ask you at that point— Well, it will probably come back to me. Would this be in the fall of '21, right after graduating from,..
MC: No, I worked, you see, from '21, and I entered medical school in '22.
ED: In '22. Because you had been working as a musician and an accompanist.
MC: That's right.
ED: And we want to know again, from a racial point of view, were you the only woman in your class in medical school?
MC: No, there were five women. They usually took two, but it happened that one of the girls was the daughter of one of the people that endowed the hospital. Another girl had the highest rank in Hunter College, and they﻿42
MC: (cont.) took her. The third girl was the relative of one of the college professors, and she had been ill as a child with infantile paralysis, and she walked with crutches. And I was the fifth one.
ED:	And were you the only Negro?
MC:	I was the only Negro, that's right.
ED:	Once again.
MC:	Among the girls. Now they had three Negro men in our class.
ED: Ah, you were the only Negro woman. And three Negro men. Do you happen to recall their names, just out of curiosity?
MC: Well, one of them was Aubrey Maynard. He later became chief surgeon at
Harlem Hospital. He interned with me, and he later became, as I say, chief surgeon there. The other two, I won't call their names, because they, unfortunately, had a rather tragic thing. One was caught cribbing, and he was discharged; and the other one developed tuberculosis, and later died. So Maynard and I were the two Negroes of the class that finished in 1926.
ED: Now during that time, did you experience any discrimination as a woman and as a Negro? Were there things that you think back on that happened at Bellevue Hospital, in terms of assignments, in terms of patients, or anything that was discouraging, or anything...
MC: I don't remember that I had any. Now, Maynard did, because he was very, very dark, and he had trouble. But as I can remember, I had no trouble at that time.
ED: You attribute it primarily to your complexion, not being dark, or to being a woman?
MC: Well, I don't know. It would be hard to say, but I---
ED: Yes. But you just went along and did all the regular assignments.
MC: Yes, that's right.
ED: I guess with Dr. Maynard, it must have been the examination of women that entered. That's usually...
MC: That's right, it's quite possible.
ED: You didn't feel at any point in medical school that there were any things, any assignments that, because you were a Negro, you did not have complete and equal access to, as all the other students?
MC: No, no.
ED: That's refreshing to hear, isn't it? Because after all, we're talking
about the days when they were lynching people in the South, in the twenties.﻿43
ED: (cont.) It was a had time in our country.
MC: When was the last lynching in the South?
ED: I heard the other day that statistic. It was something I was listening to or participating in, and they named the year. Well, I don't want to be inaccurate, so I'd better not say.
MC: As late as '45, do you think?
ED: Umm... Oh, if I could just think of what it was in relation to... I thought it was in the fifties, because it was some material that I was listening to, talking about the years just before the civil rights struggle of the sixties.
MC: I see.
ED: And I believe they had said, they said that the last lynching—and I think it was a date in the fifties. But in the twenties, the Klan was riding high in the South, and it was a very bad time. It was postwar time.
MC: And many of the soldiers were lynched in their uniforms. That was the tragic thing.
ED: And the soldiers who had had the experience in Europe of being treated much more equally came back to this country after having, many of them, almost given their lives, and their comrades had given their lives, and they suffered the terrible discrimination after the war. So it didn't affect the medical school, did it. You didn't have the carry-over there. And so the four years—what things stand out in the four years of medical school, other than the fact that you worked hard?
MC: Well, I was fortunate in that between the first and the second year
in medical school, because I had this experience in clinical pathology, I was able to get a job in the New York State Department of Health in which I was a rotating technician. In other words, as the technicians went on vacation, I would fill in. So that was a nice little sample of money. The second year...,
ED:	What did they do?
MC:	Clinical pathology. They did bacteriology and serology and...
ED:	Oh, the same sort of thing that you had been doing in college.
MC:	The same type of thing that I'd been...I got paid for that,
ED:	And this was at Bellevue, did you do it?
MC:	Well, no. It had happened that the State Department of Health building was next to the medical school, just by chance,
ED: Yes, isn't it still there, on First Avenue?﻿44
MC:	I think it still is, I think it still is. They had just built it,
so it was a nice new building.
ED:	Yes, down around Twenty-fifth Street and First Avenue.
MC:	It was Twenty-fifth Street, right off of York Avenue, I think. Yes.
ED:	Right. I think that building is still standing there.
MC:	That was between the first and the second year. Between the second
and third year, I...
ED:	You better speak up into the microphone more.
MC:	I see. In the second and third year... Dr. Broadhurst asked me to
come to Teachers College to do a research problem in bacteriology, which I did.
ED:	And for which you were paid?
MC:	Which I was paid. And then between the third and fourth year, we had
to do our obstetrics in the home, that was a part of our training. So I couldn't work then, you see. We had to stay in a hospital, but we did our deliveries out in the neighborhood homes. And then, of course, the following year, the end of the fourth year, I entered my internship.
ED:	May I ask you, when you're saying "between," "between" each time,
are you meaning the summer?
MC:	The summer, yes.
ED:	Now, were you working in the winter, while you were in medical school?
MC:	I frequently did work, at least... Frequently. I worked from six in
the evening until eleven at night, doing clinical pathology in various labs in New York City.
ED:	So when did you study?
MC:	I studied whenever I got a chance. It took me an hour by bus to get
down to the medical school.
ED:	In the morning?
MC:	In the morning. So that I always left home an hour before I had to be
at medical...and studied that hour on the bus. And then I studied whatever weekends I could, and whenever we had a long holiday, for instance, like an Easter holiday, is when I studied.
ED:	And I suppose there were periods between classes. You may not have had
a class every hour of the day, or no?
MC:	Well, I couldn't work, I had to stay in the school, you know what I mean.﻿45
MC:	(cont.) It was only an hour or two, so I would be in the library, and
studied then whenever I could.
ED:	Yes, wow.
MC:	I had a schedule. [laughter]
ED:	You did, yes. And you had good health, didn't you? You were blessed
with good health.
MC:	Yes, I was very fortunate.
ED:	You were living at this time up in Harlem? Let's see now, when you
graduated...
MC:	Yes, I lived in Harlem. 138th Street and Seventh Avenue.
ED:	Oh, is this the apartment that you described to us before, across the
street from the Greek...
MC:	From the Greek___
ED:	...farmer?
MC:	...farmer, that's right.
ED:	So you were still in that apartment, all through medical college?
MC:	All through medical college and all through my internship.
ED;	And you took the bus down Seventh Avenue? Was it called the Number Two
in those days like it is now?
MC:	That's right, yes.
ED:	And that went right down...
MC:	Right down to Twenty-sixth Street and Fifth Avenue. And then I had to
walk from Fifth Avenue to York, which is a very long walk, incidentally.
ED:	It is a long walk. Was there a bus across Twenty-sixth Street, or...
MC:	No.
ED:	Was there a bus across Twenty-third Street in those days?
MC:	I don't know.
ED:	But you know that you walked, and that's how you...
MC:	i knew that I walked.
ED:	it still is a long walk. So you had this hour ride, and you studied on﻿46
ED: (cont.) the bus. Then you were in medical school from nine or ten,
or whenever it was, to six in the evening. And where did you eat supper?
MC: Sometimes my mother would fix me a sandwich, or there was a little—what did they used to call these places—hole in the wall, where I could get hot tea or hot soup.
ED: Was money very tight?
MC: Very tight. Very tight.
ED: So you went then to the clinics, various clinics to work from six until eleven. And then from wherever you were at eleven, you took a bus, you got yourself over to the Number Two bus?
MC:	Yes, that's right.
ED:	And back home, arriving home at midnight.
MC:	When I got home, it was sometimes between eleven or twelve at night.
ED:	Did you consider the city dangerous then, as it's sometimes called now?
MC: I really didn't, because the nightclubs were very well lit up, and very
active, and there were a lot of people in the street. There were a great many Caucasians in Harlem at that time, so the streets were never deserted. But we never thought about crime or anything like that.
ED: Like we do today, in terms of being out late at night. So you were plodding around our city in the middle of the night, really, a lone woman.
MC: That's right. And never was accosted.
ED: So then you studied when you got home, or were you too tired?
MC: Well, I really did... I was too exhausted by that time. I would start in the morning on the bus.
ED: Yes, I see. You just went home and... Did you eat now, at midnight, or did you, have eaten between...
MC: Well, Mother would always have something for me. She sometimes would be up, but there'd always be something there, hot coffee, a little soup, or something.
ED: I think sometimes people don't realize, do they, the life that many who are successful had to live, in order to attain that success.
MC: That's right.
ED: So that was what happened during the school year, and you've already told us what happened between the first and the second, the second and the third. So now we're in 1926, June. Oh, I was asking you, also, what you﻿47
ED: (cont.) remembered most in medical school, other than working hard.
Were there any situations, incidents, attitudes, impressions, that stand out in your mind?
MC: Well, what happened... This background that I had in clinical pathology,
it helped me a good deal, in that I gave short anesthesias for the patients. For instance, if they wanted to set a simple fracture, the class would stand around, and I'd give the anesthesia. Because I'd had experience with animals, you see, in my clinical pathology. My second year in medical school, we had a course in clinical pathology, and when I went to attend the class, the professor said, "The only way you'll stay in my class is to work as a student assistant." So I circulated among the students, you see.
ED: Being the assistant?
MC: That's right.
ED: Now these were very gratifying, weren't they, experiences?
MC: Very gratifying. It was very natural, because I had been doing it for so long, you see.
ED: Yes, but I mean, they're natural because of your knowledge, but they're very gratifying as a person, to be singled out in your class as one who knew a little bit more than the other students did.
MC: Oh yes, indeed.
ED: And you're a woman, and you're black, you're a Negro [laughter], so it's even more interesting to make a comment on it.
MC: Yes.
ED: Anything else that stands out? Were there any training experiences in medical school that you want to share with the audience, that might be interesting, at this point? Or was it just hard work, from morning to night?
MC: it was hard work. And as I say, unfortunately, I didn't have time to be lonesome. I just rested as much as I could...
ED:	On the weekends?
MC:	That's right.
ED:	Did you work? I hope you didn't work on weekends.
MC:	Oh, yes, I had to. I had to make up.
ED:	Well, you studied. But did you also go out and work, too, at paying jobs?
MC:	That's right. You see, because a great many of the laboratories that do﻿48
MC: (cont.) the clinical pathology, they work at night in order...they work by shifts, in order to get the work ready for the doctor the next day.
ED: So that you would go on a Saturday night, perhaps?
MC: Well, I would go during the week. In other words, I didn't have a steady job. I kept in touch with all the laboratories, and they got in touch with me.
ED: So when they needed somebody they'd send for you. And this would even come on your weekends?
MC: Oh yes, indeed.
ED: Now, that means you didn't have too much of a social life, doesn't it?
MC: Absolutely none.
ED: But you were very happy.
MC: I was very happy. I enjoyed it so much —
ED: Because you loved what you were doing. You loved the studying, you loved the...
MC: That's right. And then I had my music that I could sit down and sing, and play for myself, you know.
ED: You had a piano at home, always?
MC: Yes, that's right, always.
ED: So you were a very happy, involved person.
MC: The other thing was, that I should have mentioned, way back in the college days, in the first year of college, one of the things that we had to do in music was to attend the opera. And they sold us... We paid a dollar for admission, and we stood in back of the orchestra in the old Metropolitan Opera House. So I got bitten by the opera. And interestingly enough, when we went to the opera, we very seldom had to stand very long, because some dowager would come up and tap us on the shoulder, and say, "Go to seat so-and-so, I just came for this aria." And so that we'd have a nice seat. So, as I said, occasionally, I enjoyed going to the opera, you see.
ED: Now, I want to know when you went to the opera [laughter], because the schedule we've just gone through hasn't left any free evenings. I've got to find out when you went.
MC: Occasionally, a Saturday afternoon, I would go. There were no broadcasts at those times, so that...,
ED: And maybe once in a great while in the evening, instead of going to a laboratory? But that was really your most active social part of your life, the playing of your music and singing at home. I suppose from﻿49
ED: (cont.) time to time you were called to play a concert, too, even while in medical school?
MC: One other thing that I almost forgot—I played and sang at several
weddings of my friends. Do you know Tom Johnson—he's dead now—the dentist?
ED:	I don't think so.
MC:	Well, I sang at his sister's wedding.
ED:	Oh, Dr. Thomas Johnson, yes. On 138th Street.
MC:	That's right. He's since died, you know.
ED:	No, I didn't know.
MC:	Yes, he died about a year ago, I think, But his sister...
ED:	He and his wife were living in the Isabella Nursing Home.
MC:	Well, they were, yes. He died there.
ED:	And where is Mrs. Johnson?
MC:	She's still there.
ED: She's still there. Yes, he was my dentist at one time, and he was my
father's dentist. Wonderful man. And you sang and played at their wedding?
MC: At his sister's wedding.
ED: At his sister's wedding. How about their wedding?
MC: No, I didn't. But there were several people that sang and...
ED: ...and played at the wedding. Right. Did you have a boyfriend any time during medical school?
MC: Not in medical school. Didn't have time.
ED: I remember in high school, that was the reason you dropped out of high school, because of that disappointed love affair.
MC: That's right, that's right.
ED: So we get through medical school in 1926. And where did you intern? Or did anything significant happen that summer?
MC: Well, only... Well, I went, as soon as I graduated, we had been able to... The doctors in Harlem had purchased the Edgecombe Sanitarium, that was at 138th Street and—138th or 137th Street—and Edgecombe Avenue. 138th Street, it was, I think it was. No, 137th Street. 137th Street. And the﻿50
MC: (cont.) doctor that owned the sanitarium lived in the house adjoining
it, facing Edgecombe Avenue. So that I was able to move into that house, the two middle floors. The basement they used for something, and the top floor was the operating room. So I had my office there.
ED: Oh, you set up office there.
MC: I set up office there.
ED: Now, you were living still with your mother at 138th Street.
MC: Yes, my mother and father. That's right.
ED: Your mother and father. And this is 138th Street. So you're in this hospital, then, just in the daytime, in office hours?
MC: No, no. The doctors that owned the hospital had their patients there, and the Department of Health code was that there had to be a doctor resident upon the property. So that I filled that need for them, you see.
ED: I see. By having your	office there.
MC: Having my office, and living there, you see. In other words, I was on
twenty-four-hour call in case the other doctors, whose patients were there, could not be reached.
ED: Well, you didn't really live there, though, did you?
MC: I lived there, surely.
ED: I see. So you weren't living with your parents. Or did they move in?
MC: They, the three of us.
ED: Oh, the three of you moved in. That's when you had the second and third floor.
MC: That's right.
ED: I see, the three of you. You left 138th Street.
MC: And we stayed there until '52, and then we moved up to 409 Edgecombe.
ED: I see. Is that where you had your office next? First at Edgecombe [Sanitarium] and then your next office at 409, that well-known, famous building. What was involved in the decision to move there, to 409? How did you come to.. .
MC: They began increasing my rent. You see, I was renting from them.
ED: From the doctors. Didn't you tell me at one point, too, that you were very useful to the doctors?
MC: Well, I was useful in that I made rounds for them on their patients. I
﻿51
MC: (cont.) occasionally was able to get a patient of my own in if there
was a free bed, if there was a vacant bed. And I gave anesthesias for them, for which I collected a little money, occasionally.
ED: But it was really to their advantage to have you there.
MC: Oh, indeed it was. In other words, if you read my book, you will find out that I became their handymaid, you see.
ED: Yes, I see. Was there anything financial in it for you? Because you were paying rent, weren't you?
MC: Oh, surely. I was paying rent.
ED: Yes. You were really their handymaid, handmaiden, or whatever you want to call it.
MC: That I certainly was.
ED: So they increased your rent, and this got you?
MC: Well, it did, simply because, as I say, they... And then they didn't recognize me on the outside. You know, I wasn't recognized in the community until I had been practicing about twelve years.
ED: Tell me about that. Tell me why.
MC: Well, what happened was--- I'm afraid some of this is going into my
book. Yes, you see. You want to turn this off, and I can tell you if...
ED: Okay. Why don't we just skip that, because people who want to research that can read it in your book.
MC: Yes, fine, all right.
ED: These were the days of... But your next big move was to 409, your decision to move to 409.
MC: I think we can put in, between there, that as time went on, I was taking care of their families, but still...
ED: Of the doctors?
MC: Of the doctors. Their wives, their mothers, and their children.
ED: For no fee.
MC: No fees. And I sometimes delivered their wives. And then, it was only when they began to hear that I had some contact with Memorial Hospital that they began to send me cases for biopsy and diagnosis of cancer.﻿52
ED: Well now, we want to ask you about that Memorial Hospital affiliation. But first, I want to ask you, what were you using for income?
MC: Well, every clinic that was available that they paid five or ten dollars a session, I got the Children's Aid Society, the Speedwell unit—that was for convalescing babies, Negro babies—because the Speedwell unit had a large setup for white children. But they had a smaller unit for Negro children—Negro babies, I should say—these children were under three years of age, and I took care of them.
ED: Now, where did you do this, physically? You'd go to the clinic?
MC: No, what happened at the Speedwell was this. This pediatrician in
New York, a very famous one, had decided that if you can get a child out of a hospital as soon as possible, that it will probably do better, when you've got the disease under control, and send it home, because if it stayed in the hospital too long it would pick up another disease. So he devised a method of having neighborhood homes of women that would take care of children from the hospital, feed them, and get them up to their normal weight, and then return them to their own home. And there was a nurse that went in to see these children once a day. If there was anything that happened, the doctor went in to see the baby about twice a week, unless the nurse called. But the nurse made a daily visit to all the children. Now, then they decided to set up this kind of a home, this kind of a thing, for the Negro babies, and I had a public health nurse that saw the patients for me, and I would go in, and of course was on call. So that was money.
ED: I see. And they restricted you to the Negro babies?
MC: Yes, that's right. In other words, I had charge of the Negro unit, if you want to put it that way. And then there was a family care center, which...one of the agencies had all members of the family examined once a year by the doctor. So that I was attending anywheres from two to four clinics a week, for which I made about twenty dollars a week toward my rent, you see.
ED: Yes. Very low income, wasn't it?
MC: Very low income.
ED: And you're going to talk in your book aboit the real lack of recognition of you as a doctor—by the other doctors, or by the community?
MC: By the other doctors. Now, when I first started to practice medicine in Harlem, the Negro doctors, male, were just trying to get entry in the practice of medicine in Harlem. See, the white doctors had had it for years. The white, the Caucasian doctors had been the physicians of the community for years. And you see, the Negro doctors had to fight to get a place in the practice of medicine.
ED: And they couldn't practice at Harlem Hospital, could they?﻿53
MC: It's a city hospital. You don't practice in a city hospital. You attend a clinic in order to learn some of the new things.
ED: Could you do that...
MC: Wait a minute. Now, in the upstairs department, what we call the
in-service department, you made rounds on patients, and you saw the use of drugs, and the progress of a disease. Now, a Negro could not get a position in either one of those, neither one of those situations.
ED: Despite the fact that it was a city hospital.
MC: In spite of the fact that it was a city hospital. Now, I'm going to enlarge upon this point in my book, because it's quite complicated, I mean, but it really is true.
ED: And quite a terrible story, isn't it?
MC: That's right. And then some of the clinics, like the tuberculosis clinic and the venereal...agency—it wasn't a clinic—it's an agency where you got material in tuberculosis and venereal diseases, they closed in Harlem because of financial reasons. So there was no help at all, there was nothing, and the incident rate was highest in Harlem than it was in any other part of New York City.
ED: So the irony was that the need was greatest and the service was the least.
MC: That's right, and still they were pulling the services away from us.
ED: That's going to be a very, very important part of your book to know, to hear about, to read about.
MC: Yes, well, it's going to be. That, I think, is going to be most important as to how... And not only that, but we could not get into postgraduate medical schools.
ED:	Nowhere in the city?
MC:	Nowhere in New York City. I defeated that. In a very interesting way, I defeated that.
ED:	Do you want to tell us about it, or do you want to save it for your book?
MC:	I want to save it for the book.
ED:	Okay, the story of it. Could you tell us which postgraduate schools you...
MC:	There were only two in New York City at the time, and both of them...
ED:	And you defeated that.
MC:	Yes.﻿54
ED: Okay, let's leave that as a tantalizing bit of information which will send people to reading your book.
MC: Yes, mm hmm.
ED: So, this was your life. And from this time, while you were working
at the Edgecombe Clinic, and before you made the decision to open the office at 409. Because your rent went up, your income was extremely low—was it not—and your recognition factor was at low...
MC: Yes, that's right. Now, fortunately for me, my practice that I developed myself, the nucleus of it was the fact that I had white, I had Caucasian patients of all nations, Japanese and Chinese. Because of the war, you see, the Japanese couldn't get a doctor in... Did you know that, in New York City? They came to me, by referral, so I developed a practice of my own...
ED: For rejects.
MC: That's right, of the rejects, that's right.
ED: And some of the wives of these doctors, right?
MC: Oh, yes. But I did get paid for those, you see. Now, the white patients, the Caucasian patients I had, were from families that I had worked with at Harlem Hospital when I interned. So, I was building a little practice up of my own, which made me independent. With the clinics that I had, you see, so that...
ED: This is fa continuation] of the interview with Dr. May Chinn, July 13.
You were telling us about what happened with your building of your own patients before deciding to move to 409. And then you said off tape, something about Dr. Crump, Sr., Dr. Walter Crump.
MC: Yes. Now Dr. Walter Crump was from a family of abolitionists, and for two or three generations.,.
ED: Pardon me, he's a white man.
MC: He's a white man, Walter Crump, Sr. They had been interested in the
underground railroad. And they were very, very solicitous of the Negro. He devised a method by which he could help Negro doctors. The first week in April each year, he attended what they call Negro Health Week, which was held at Tuskegee University. He would hire a train from New York that would pick up white and Negro doctors on the way to Tuskegee, who would either offer courses or would go to learn. And he would give the whole seminar of a week. Now, this is very detailed, which as I said, I can't run into, but it was on the way coming back... Oh, by﻿55
MC: (cont.) the way, that the doctors were picked up, never at the railroad stations, but always in the railroad yards, at some siding.
ED: As it went South?
MC: That's right. Because it was against the law for the Negro and the white to occupy the same car. So that when we got to...just outside of Tuskegee, we were met by cars, railroad...at least automobiles, with the curtains drawn down, and they would take us into the campus. We were warned not to leave the campus, the week we were there.
ED: Dr. Crump offered the courses all himself, or did he have other doctors participating?
MC: I think he financed it himself.
ED: He financed it, but did he have other doctors that did some of the lectures?
MC: Oh, yes, surely. These, some of the doctors that he picked up on his way
ED: Were white?
MC: ___were white and Negro doctors, you see.
ED: I see. Were you in the same car, which was against the law?
MC: Well, it was a whole train. We had a whole train.
ED: Oh, you had a whole train. And he financed all of this?
MC: That's right.
ED: A train that went down picking up blacks, that was picking the blacks up off on the sidings.
MC: That's right.
ED: What a story.
MC: Now, after giving the clinics, of course, on my way back home, I had one good night's sleep. You see, because, I mean, I could sleep without the telephone ringing, or the demands of a patient, or something. So at that point, I would make my plans for the next year of how I would try to increase my practice, and what I would do. That was when I decided that the health problems in Harlem was not a single problem, it was a community problem. So I decided to work for a degree in public health, which I did, and I got that degree in '33. You see, I had to do it while I was practicing. But I had a different point of view from just an office practice.
ED:
You wanted to make a contribution, and you wanted to work on the project..﻿56
MC: Well, I wanted to do something that was very live, and I wanted also, to also think of the possibilities of getting a public health job, you see. It was a little selfish, but, nevertheless...
ED: Well, it had to be, from the experience that you had had with your M.D. degree. And the story of that will be in your book, what postgraduate school you attended.
MC: Yes, and what happened there.
ED: So you got your public health degree in 1933. When did you open the office at 409? Did you get the public health job?
MC: No, I didn't. That will come up in my book, why I didn't get it. It's a very unfortunate thing, but anyhow, I didn't. Again, the men fought me, and whatnot.
ED: You had as hard a time against the male Negro physicians, or physicians?
MC: Well, as far as the public health job went, it was both the Negro and the Caucasian doctors. They were all against me. They went down to the Department of Health and registered their protest.
ED: Because you were a woman?
MC: To the point where they said they didn't want to be tied to the apron strings of a woman.
ED: What fortitude you have to have. Was it when you didn't get the job,
is that the decision to move to 409, or was it that the decision was part of many things?
MC: No, no, that had nothing to do with 409. I had to make that decision before I went to 409, you see. Now my...
ED: I see. I want to hear about the moving, to open your own office at 409, with this clientele that you had built up.
MC: Yes, well we were there...
ED: Did it take a lot of bravery, I mean, to open your own office in such a prestigious building, and wasn't the rent high?
MC: No, as I told you, the... If you read one article that I've written, that the men divided themselves into three groups. One said that I didn't exist—you know, I just didn't exist. And the second group called themselves being generous by sending me their own families, but I got no pay for it. Now, the third group called themselves supporting me by sending me their calls after midnight. I think I told you that. So, there was something else I... Oh, in the meantime, as I said, we couldn't get any clinical work. We couldn't get into any of the city hospitals, in the clinics or in the upstairs departments, with the exception of﻿57
MC: (cont.) one or two male doctors that had been in the war, and they got
in because they had been in. They got into Harlem Hospital, but they...
ED: Because of their war...
MC: Yes. Now, the other thing, Sydenham Hosptal and Wadsworth Hospital
were two private hospitals. And because of the turmoil that they had at Harlem Hospital, Dr. Peter Murray—I don't know whether I can mention this name—and myself were given courtesy privileges. We could take our patients to these two hospitals..
ED:	Sydenham, which was...
MC:	Well, Sydenham. Whatever it is, yes, it's the one on...
EDr	123rd?
MC:	124th.
ED:	124th and LaSalle Place, isn't it?
MC:	No, no.
ED:	Eighth Avenue and Manhattan...
MC:	Is it Manhattan? Manhattan Avenue, yes,
ED:	Manhattan, right. Manhattan Avenue and 124th.
MC:	And the Wadsworth is up in the upper Manhattan, around 168th Street, I think.
ED:	Up near Broadway, isn't it?
MC:	Yes, that's right. It's a small private hospital. Well, I did my obstetrics there, and...
ED: You could take your patients there for,...
MC: Yes, I could. We could attend our patients ourselves.
ED: Which was an exception.
MC: Before then, I had to do my deliveries at home, in the patient's home.
And before then, Dr. Murray and I would have to operate in the patient's home.
ED: Oh, boy. Which was risky, wasn't it?
MC: Oh, it certainly was. But we had good nurses, you know—the family, the grandmother and whatnot.﻿58
ED: And the main thing, I suppose, was skill and being sanitary, wasn't it? Boiling everything, and knowing what you were doing.
MC: Well, you see, fortunately for me, when I interned, I knew how to type blood because of my clinical experience, so I could give transfusions. I could match the blood and give transfusions. I could give intravenous medication, because of my internship.
ED: When you did a transfusion, would you often do a transfusion direct, from one to the other?
MC: That's the way that we did it.
ED: And you'd match the blood of, what—a relative, or a person in the neighborhood?
MC: Well, whoever applied. You see, I got that training, and then I did clinical pathology, you see.
ED: Was the...blood at that time wasn't stored, though, was it?
MC: Oh, no, no. This was direct from patient...
ED: So in other words, you would have the record of a patient with Type B blood, and you would contact that person.
MC: Well, I would have to do it almost within twelve hours, if we decided on a transfusion, because... And I had a little lab of my own where I could do blood counts and urinalysis and blood typing.
ED: And where did you have that little lab?
MC: In my office.
ED: In 409?
MC: No, no, at the Edgecombe,
ED: Oh, boy. You know, really, this is like hearing the story of a pioneer doctor, isn't it? And these are modern times.
MC: Well, we practiced medicine, at least I practiced medicine in Harlem as they did it a hundred years before.
ED: Of course. This is exactly what it is.
MC: That's right. We used the patient's bed or the ironing board as the operating room.
ED: The ironing board. I guess—am I overemphasizing this? I guess that
one of the most important factors was the sterilization, wasn't it? In other words, as long as you had boiling water, you could operate in the home no matter what the circumstances.﻿59
MC: And as long as we had a coal stove on which they could make our dressings and wrap them up in newspaper, brown newspaper, and bake them in the oven, we had sterile dressings.
ED: That I' ve never heard of. I only know about boiling water. So you dropped them in the boiling water, and then wrapped them?
MC: No, no. We baked them in the oven.
ED: That heat sterilizes the dressing.
MC: That heat sterilized it. Because the dressings had to be dry. And the instruments we could boil in their washboilers, that they used to wash their clothes in.
ED: Yes. Oh, I wish that somehow we could not only have this on tape, but
we could have it in visual, as well, you know. Because this is a story!
MC: Yes, well, lhat's right.
ED: On Channel 13, sometimes they're able to re-create... Now wouldn't it be wonderful someday...
MC: Well, somebody has approached me about Channel 13. If we ever get this thing straightened out here, it's quite possible that we will...
ED: I hope so, that you could do the narrative, and they could set up the
stage. And you could have the boiling water in the old-fashioned thing, and the woman, and the person, and the room, and they could show actually how you were operating...
MC: That's right. I'm going to tell you some other things, too. At these homes, they only had kerosene lamps. So you can imagine what we had to do for light for our surgery. Dr. Murray and I would have to bring our surgical lamps from our office, and batteries, because, above 125th Street, they had only direct current. They hadn't changed it to a.c. So in order to plan an operation, we would have to take two or three days to plan it. I did the sterilization, and the setting up of the operation. Dr. Murray would bring his instruments. He had a special bag, that he would have his instruments sterilized before he came there.
ED: So with direct current only, you could plug a battery into it.
MC: Change it to a.c. See, our equipment was for a.c.
ED: I see. So it would be converted. Oh, boy.
MC: And of course we gave the patient... Dr. Murray and I would see...
He went in to either see the patient in the morning and I would see it at night, or vice versa. And both of us were on call until the patient was able to get up.
ED: And you would do the anesthesia right there, too, on the spot?﻿60
MC: I would do the anesthesia.
ED: And you both did the operating? Or he was the surgeon?
MC: Well, he was a surgeon, and he would have a member of the family help with his instruments, hold certain instruments.
ED: Where did he train, Dr. Murray, Peter Marshall Murray?
MC: At Howard, I think. I think he did. He had been quite a surgeon in Jersey, so, before then...
ED: Operating out of a Negro hospital?
MC: That's right. Private...
ED: And all this time there were these hospitals all over New York City that denied you and him and others access?
MC: That's right. And all the Negroes, in all the different boroughs, when they finally opened Harlem Hospital, they would have to come in from their borough to the clinics if they wanted to observe anything.
ED: Only place they could come and observe.
MC: This is a long story which I will tell.
ED: Yes, which we will hear more about. But it's just unbelievable, how
we take things for granted, years later. I still want to get a little more detail on the move to 409. We were way back and saying they decided to raise your rent, and you decided you needed to get another office.
MC: Yes.
ED: And how did you pick that building?
MC: Well, I just was searching for an office, and fortunately for me, a doctor had just moved out, so I was able to get his place.
ED: I remember that office. I came to you once there, first floor left on.,. What was the number of the apartment, do you remember?
MC: I don't remember the number.
ED: One-E or something like that? But first floor, up the stairs and turn to the left. Now. You moved in there for your office. Did you also move in there to live?
MC: I lived in my apartment for a while.
ED: Yes, your mother and father?
MC: No, my father had died. He died at 44 [Edgecombe]. See, my﻿61
MC: (cont.) mother died six years after he did, at 409 [Edgecombe],
ED: I see. So you and your mother took an apartment, and lived, and had your office there.
MC: That's right. And then finally, I was able to get one of the little apartments up on the roof. Did you know about the penthouse?
ED:	No. I know the penthouse.
MC:	Yes, I had one of those apartments, finally.
ED:	Oh, I do remember that, yes.
MC:	Regina had one, Regina Andrews...
ED:	Right, Regina Andrews.
MC:	She was right across from me.
ED:	Right, I remember___ Because we lived in that building. Were you there
in... Yes, you were there in 1947, weren't you?
MC: We moved in '52. We moved up there in '52.
ED: We lived there in 1946 and '47. And I believe Regina had her apartment, the Andrewses had their apartment then.
MC: No, they didn't live there at the time. They lived at one of the other buildings. But when we got the penthouse opened... You know, the penthouse is very interesting. That building was originally the home of the [New York] Yankees, Yankee players. And Babe Ruth lived in that house.
ED: It was the home of the Yankee players?
MC: That's right. That was there.
ED: You mean, the whole building?
MC: The whole building.
ED: Do you know anything about the original building of the building? Was it built for the Yankees?
MC: It was built for the Yanks. This was their home. This was their... Not their summer quarters, it was their...when they were... Yes, it was their summer quarters, when they were playing.
ED: Of course, because right across the bridge was Yankee Stadium.
MC: That's right.﻿62
ED: I see. I didn't know that. Yes. But that building was built for the Yankees, and so they all lived there. I see. And when did Negroes start moving into 409?
MC: It was with the, before the depression.
ED: Before '32, '29.
MC: Evidently twenties... In the twenties was the [Harlem] Renaissance. You know, Aaron Douglas was there and...
ED: He was one of the first, wasn't he?
MC: He was one of the first. And Bledsoe, the singer...
ED: Jules Bledsoe?
MC: Yes, he was there.
ED: So, artistic people, I suppose, moved in first, during the Renaissance of the twenties?
MC:	That's right, mm hmm..
ED:	So for a while the building was occupied by both Negroes and whites.
MC:	That's right.
ED:	And then gradually...
MC:	Gradually became Negro.
ED:	And it became the kind of signal building, which we... What do you call it? A name building. Now, you moved in in what year?
MC: In '52.
ED: It was all colored by then?
MC: Yes.
ED: How was your practice?
MC: Oh, see, I had... It was really, still remained integrated—I mean,
white and Negroes. And the better class of Negroes, and a very fine class of white people. It was very nice.
I wanted to bring in cancer somewhere. My interest in cancer began when I first started to practice medicine. I would make calls on these homes in which the people were really very... Oh, I usually say this, that my practice when I first started was very old people, and very young people—the babies that I delivered—and then the middle part of my practice were the people that came from Harlem, you see. Now, in the﻿63
MC: (cont.) very old people that I would make calls on, they were very, very sick. And I'd begin to suspect that they had not the usual acute illnesses, but some devastating, low-grade illness which is long term. And I began to think... And so that, really, it resolved itself into giving them something for pain. That pain was the outstanding thing. And I began to wonder, "Well now, there must be... These people must have a cancer." You know, I mean, they were wasted and all that sort of thing. But very well taken care of by their family. You know, the nursing care was excellent.
ED: Yes. Because then you had the family around, in those days.
MC: That' s right. The family was really wonderful. And we could occasionally get a Henry Street nurse in.
ED: The visiting nurse service.
MC: So then I began to get... I said, there must be some reason for diagnosing this disease early. So if I had a patient that I thought might have cancer, and was ambulatory, I would send them to Memorial clinic. That was the one place in New York City where they were studying cancer. None of the other hospitals, when I first started, was interested. And so a great many times they were turned away, because Memorial Hospital was a private hospital.
ED: Were they turned away because of their race?
MC: They couldn't pay. I don't think it was because they were Negro. It was being financed by very wealthy people. There were only a certain number of beds, so that there was never a bed free. So what I would do, then, one of these trips back from Tuskegee, I said, now, if I go to the clinic with the patient, and say, "I am Dr. Chinn, this is my patient. Is it possible that I could watch the doctor examine it?" Well, sometimes I'd be refused, and sometimes I would be accepted. So the times that I was accepted to watch the examination, I would transfer that kind of examination to my office. So I began sending patients, ambulatory, to— they had what we call a diagnostic clinic at Memorial—to Memorial. And it happened that some of the men that I had studied with in my clinical pathology were connected with the hospital, so I had two or three contacts there. And they, out of courtesy to me, would see my patient, and take them in. Of course, this whole thing was evolving. Finally, after twelve years of this kind of struggle—and Memorial had then moved to Sixty-eighth Street and New York Avenue where it is now—the men in the community, the Negro men and white doctors, would send me patients to do a biopsy on. And I would send these biopsies to Memorial with my name attached to it.
ED: Because you had learned to do these biopsies when you observed?
MC: That's right. One of the doctors, while I was at Memorial—I mean, when I went with my patients—showed me how to do a proper biopsy.
ED: So you would send these biopsies down to Memorial?﻿64
MC: Well, finally, as I say, some of the doctors in Harlem began sending me patients to do biopsies. So finally, what they would do, they would call to let me know they had a positive case or a negative case, and they would send a written report later.
ED: So they would send you, yes.
MC: So I would send the biopsies down to Memorial. And as I say, they would phone if I had a positive case, and follow it up with a written...in a day or so. One day when they were giving me a report, the pathologist said, "Hold the phone, somebody wants to speak to you." And the next person that spoke to me was Dr. [Elise] L'Esperance. She was the woman that started the cancer detection clinic in New York City. A very wealthy woman, whose family had had several cases of cancer. And she decided, instead of practicing medicine, she would try to find out if you could diagnose cancer early. And so she said to me, "I have a vacancy in one of my clinics. Would you be interested?" So of course, I was dumbfounded. I just couldn't speak, you know. And when I didn't speak, she said, "Well, could you come down, and we'll talk about it." So, I finally got myself together and I asked her, "Could I come in?" Because I wanted her to see me. I didn't want to be embarrassed, and I didn't want her to be embarrassed. So I kept the appointment, and when I went down, she was surprised—you know. Chinn, you see—the name has been...one of these things. She had evidently expected to see a Chinese, and I appear. But anyhow, she took me over and introduced me to her staff.
ED: She didn't bat an eyebrow, though, did she?
MC: She kept looking at me and trying to decide, What was I?
ED: But she didn't let that stop her, did she?
MC: Never said a thing. So anyhow, I decided to do it. This was something I'd been trying to do for all my life—you know, all my medical life—to get some kind of connection like this. So I joined her staff, and I didn't know there was a salary attached to it.
ED: You were just glad to be able to be at the clinic.
MC: That's right, yes. [laughter] Well, anyhow. Interestingly enough..,
ED: What a wonderful story.
MC: ...I was telling my writer that I was connected at Memorial from 1945
until '76—I think '76 or '74—something like that. But at any rate, the interesting thing was that I finally worked up to the point that I had charge of three of the clinics, and I had nine white male and women doctors under me. But that took years, of course, to develop.
ED: Sometimes, with the persistence, it finally equals out, doesn't it, and you complete the circle.﻿65
MC: But as I said, it's very interesting. Once I got back to school, it seemed that fate was in my favor, you know.
ED: When you went back to get your public health degree?
MC: Yes. You see, from there, and—
ED: Things began to look forward.
Okay, tell me again about sending your patients who were ambulatory...,
MC: I would take them to the hospital myself.
ED: You would accompany them..
MC: I would accompany them, yes. And I would say that, "This is my patient
and I've made an appointment for her. I'm the family doctor, Dr. Chinn*11
ED: And you would have made this appointment over the phone.
MC: Phone, that's right, that's right.
ED: Giving the name Dr. Chinn. So, you told me off tape that they were surprised when ther saw a Negro doctor.
MC: Yes. Well, they were surprised. They couldn't quite figure out how
I got the name Chinn. But this had been one of the things I've had all my life. Bittt going back, some of the nurses refused to let me even see any of the doctors. Now it happened that when I was studying clinical pathology in my college days, way back there when one of the doctors was then connected with Memorial. He saw me, and recognized me, and he was one of the doctors that invited me into the booth so I could watch him examine the patient. He also later taught me how to do a proper biopsy. So I did these types of examinations, and I did the biopsies in my office.
Now after a while, I had... This had been going on from about 1932 up to about 1942. You see, all this time, this was going on at the clinics. And, as I say, then it began to get rumored around that I had some connection with Memorial. It was not official, it was just simply a courtesy type of thing, you see what I mean? And then, as I say, the local doctors began sending me their patients to do biopsies, and I would send all this work down to Memorial to this same person, you know. And he would give me the reading, as I say, if it was a positive case, he'd give it over the phone and follow it up with a written report within a day or two. So then, as I say, the men began to think that I must be somebody connected with Memorial Hospital. I had no status at the time, but one of the times in which he called me to say that I had a positive report, he said, "Hold the phone," and the person that...the next person that spoke to me was Dr. L'Esperance.﻿66
ED: That story you told us just before we broke for lunch. Right, that's a wonderful story.
MC: Oh, I told you that story. That's right. And then, as I told you, I
worked and I didn't know that there was a salary, but it was wonderful. So I worked in that clinic. And then while I was there, I got a fellowship, a small fellowship, to be able to go through all the services at Memorial Hospital. By this time they had moved down to Sixty-eighth Street. So I had a rotating service in which I could go into the clinic and stay as long as I wanted to. And then when I wanted to change, I would go to another clinic. So that for two years I was able to go through these... I didn't get paid for this. This was just free time, you see.
ED: I see. And this is the one you later became director of?
MC: No, what happened was, 1 was still, I was working in Dr. L'Esperance's clinic. And I said to her one day, "Is there any way that I could see some of these special cases, active cancer?" You see, in her clinic, the person was apparently well. There were no symptoms whatsoever. Our job was to try to find an early cancer so it could be treated early. So, very much to my surprise, she spoke to the director of the service at Memorial and I went over and talked with him and he said to me, "This will have to come up before the board. I'll let you hear from me in a couple of weeks." So, I waited and waited, and didn't... In the meantime, I was still working at Strang, which was what the clinic was called—Strang Clinic. So finally, I didn't hear from him in about three weeks and I called up his secretary. And she said, "Oh, yes, Dr. Chinn, Doctor..."—I won't mention this man's name—"he's here now, and I'm sure he'll want to talk with you." So he came and he said, "We were so busy at our meetings that we could not discuss this. We didn't have time to discuss it. But if you're interested in it," he said,'come down and talk to me." So, I went back again, and as soon as I walked in he said, "I think I'll take it..." He said, "Would you like to start in my clinic?" And so I started in his clinic. And he was the one that guided me all through and he was the one that was able to get these, the privilege to go to all these other clinics, to stay as I wanted to. Now, I didn't get paid for this you understand, but I was learning. I saw really the active cancer in all stages, you see.
ED: This greatly enhanced your knowledge.
MC: That's right. And then, when I...somewheres along the way, I was voted to this Ewing Society. That was because of the work that I did there. They felt that I had the material to... So that was an honorary thing.
ED: That was an honorary appointment.
MC: That was an honor, yes, that's right.
ED: The Ewing Society?﻿67
MC: The Ewing Society. It's now been changed to the Oncology Surgical
Society. It's been changed about the past five years. And I'm listed every year that it comes out.
ED: As a member of it. A fellow, I guess they call it.
MC: Yes. Well, I'm listed as a retired member, see, since I'm not working
at the hospital now. But for years, I had a status at the Strang Clinic.
ED: That's the same Strang Clinic that's so well known?
MC: Well, there were two Strang Clinics. There was one at New York Infirmary, and there was one at Memorial. See, Dr. L'Esperance had charge of both of them. She started both clinics, so that I would work at both clinics.
ED: When did they move to Thirty-fourth Street? Was that from '68?
MC: Oh, they moved to... That's when I stopped going, because the distance was so far down, and there was no place to park a car, and see, I just couldn't spend all that time and try to make a living in my office, you see.
ED: I see. So that's when you had to give it up, when they moved. Was that about ten years ago that they moved to Thirty-fourth Street or longer?
MC: It was less than that. About six or seven years ago, I think, something like that. Well, it may have been '74. I'll have to look that date...
ED: It's about ten, I recall, because I work not far, about a half a block from there. I think it was about that time.
MC: Well, it's when they established themselves in Thirty-fourth Street that I did not go from Memorial.
ED: You mentioned something that you had promised, along time back on the tape, to speak of, and that was your acquiring of an automobile. At what period in life did that occur?
MC: That was probably in 1932..
ED: Oh, way back.
MC: Way back there.
ED: Depression days.
MC: Now, it came about as... If I made a call at a house, once or twice they, before I could even see the patient, the patient would ask me what kind of a car did I come in. And I said, "A car?" "You know what I mean. After all..." I said, "I don't have a car." It was status they were trying to... So I finally, I answered the question so frequently that I was advised that I'd better get a car, otherwise I wouldn't have patients. In other words...and I bought the cheapest car﻿68
MC: (cont.) I could, which was a Nash.
ED: So you got the car because everybody expected you to own one.
MC: That's right.
ED: Of course, in those days, you could park out in front of 409. You had no problem, did you?
MC: Oh, indeed you could, yes.
ED: And you could park downtown, then, couldn't you?
MC: Oh, yes, definitely. Many a time have I gone downtown to the...driven down to Seventieth Street and Fifth Avenue and parked my car there, and then take the bus down to the department stores, and pick up my bundles and come back and put them in the trunk of my car, and come on home.
ED: Yes, those were the days. Far cry from today with an automobile in New York City.
MC: So, I finally had to get another Nash, and... The first Nash I had was a convertible. Well, I had trouble with that because I had two or three people jump on the back, you know, with it opened.
ED: With it opened, yes. Oh, driving down Seventh Avenue or wherever in your open convertible with the top pushed back. That was a sporty sight, wasn't it? [laughter]
MC: I had, then I got two Cadillacs. Then I had arrived, you see. But they were second-hand cars.
ED: Well, I know, I know what you're talking about. Well, now, we're into your practice of later years. And there were several spots that I had in mind when we first started. When did you... You practiced at 409 and you retired from there?
MC:	No, no, I left there in '57.
ED:	In 1957?
MC:	And then I went to 100 LaSalle Street.
ED:	In 1957 or '67?
MC:	In '57.
ED:	Oh. And you moved to LaSalle Street? You moved to where you are now?
MC: Yes. Not exactly. My office was at 100 LaSalle Street. And then I
had my... I couldn't live in the office, so I had to get an apartment in the same building. And I stayed there, and then my rent began going up, and not only that, but when...since the project was new, I...﻿69
ED:
What's that? Park West? No, it isn't. That's Morningside Gardens, isn't it?
MC: Morningside Gardens, yes. I had to pay $4,000 to have the apartment converted into an office. You see, this was an added expense that I hadn't ever faced.
ED: That's a co-op, isn't it?
MC: That's a co-op, yes. But that was a business, you see, this was the
reason, you see. So it took me some time paying that $4,000 off. And I didn't have a car then—I had to give my car up before I left 409, because I coudn't support a car and pay for this office alteration. And then, as it is with any business, they increase your rent. And so finally, since I was maintaining two apartments—my office and my apartment upstairs—then I had to work very hard in order to take care of those, with the rent going up and whatnot.
ED: Was your office at 100 LaSalle Street on the first floor?
MC: That's right. And my apartment was on the twenty-first floor.
ED: I see. In other words, a professional apartment on one floor and then your...
MC: Living...
ED: ...your living quarters upstairs.
MC: Yes, because nobody could live in their office. It was a business, and they wouldn't allow you to live there.
ED: So, what did you decide to do then, when the rent kept going up?
MC: Well, of course I got very uneasy, but I kept maintaining myself, since I could pay both of them. Then I took a trip, a vacation to South America, and three days after I got back, I was robbed—my apartment on the twenty-first floor. I was robbed.
ED: Your living apartment. After you got back, you were robbed?
MC: Three days after I got back. And I had been gone for three weeks.
ED: Amazing. Were you downstairs in your office at the time of the robbery?
MC: No, I had just come back, and I had gone to the grocery store to buy some groceries. When I came back and went up to my apartment to put the key in the door, there was no lock there, there was just a hole there. They had ripped the lock out of the door. So then I just couldn't stay in the place. And I'd been looking for a place to live. I was going to continue my office, but the rents were so terribly high, I was just fortunate to be able to get into another building. So at that time, after fifty years, I decided, no further struggle, and I would have to﻿70
MC: (cont.) live off what I had.
ED: And you had been practicing fifty years when you made this decision?
MC: Yes, fifty-two, I think, fifty-two or fifty-three. The other thing is, in the meantime, I had acquired... After I left Memorial, I had three day care centers, you see, and that gave me income.
ED: That you were the visiting doctor for? Where were they?
MC: Well, they were, all three of them were in Harlem. And then what
happened, they began cutting those down because of economic reasons. So finally I had two, and then I had this fall, I think I told you, in which I had a head injury.
ED: Before we get to the fall, let me just straighten out a couple of things. Would you tell us t&e day care centers, the nurseries that you were the doctor for, just for historical reasons? Which ones were they, which three day care centers?
MC: Well, there was one called the Manhattanville, that was on Broadway.
ED: Right. That's 100 and...
MC: About 138th Street and Broadway. And then there was another one at 145th Street, between Amsterdam and Broadway.
ED: Oh, yes. By the church there?
MC: Yes. And then there was another one, across from the project, in the Grant Houses.
ED: Oh, yes, near 125th and Amsterdam. You know, someday, this recording, this taping, this material, may be being researched by some little child who recalls, "Oh, that was my doctor. That's May Chinn. I was a little girl..." or, "I was a little boy at that day center." That's why we sometimes like to identify places, because, you know, I hope, and the Schlesinger Library hopes that these tapes and this material will be used for hundreds of years to come.
MC: Oh, wonderful.
ED: ...as people are doing research about early women doctors, which is what you are—you know, a pioneer in your field. Because this is richly historical fact that we are recording today.
Now, let me ask you one other question before we get to the fall. You moved out of your apartment when you had been robbed, on the twenty-first floor of 100 LaSalle Place.
MC: That's right. At the same time, I discontinued my office, because I took the day care center work.﻿71
ED: Right. Why did you think it would be safer to live in another building of the same development?
MC: Why, I didn't think it was safer. I just couldn't live in the apartment—a stranger in the apartment, and things scattered all over the place, you know.
ED: I see. The psychological impact of walking into your own apartment. MC: That's right.
ED: So you just wanted to leave. And what floor are you on now? MC: I'm now on the tenth floor. ED: I see, in another building.
MC: Yes, in another building. I miss the river. You see, my apartment
faced the river, and when I first moved there, Palisades Park was right across, on top of a hill, and it was a beautiful sight after work to come in and find this...walk in the door, and find Palisades Park all lit up in front of me.
ED:	Yes. Oh, you mean the amusement park.
MC:	Yes.
ED:	That's gone now, isn't it?
MC:	Oh, long gone.
ED:	But you did get that beautiful sunset, didn't you?
MC:	Oh, yes, beautiful sunset.
ED:	Did it bathe your apartment in gold?
MC:	Oh, yes, definitely.
ED: I have visited people on the West Side at six o'clock in the evening— their whole apartment is a gold color.
MC: Oh, beautiful. The skies are gorgeous. And then the river was interesting, because they had all kinds of boats on it, little sailboats in the summertime, and all that sort of thing.
ED: Now, you're on the tenth floor and you don't face the river—at least you're cut off from the river.
MC: I see a little bit of it. Just a very small bit of it.
ED: Are you in a smaller apartment, or the same size?
MC: The same size apartment.﻿72
ED: Same size, but lower down. And so you decided to give up your practice. Now, tell us about the fall, which is such sad news. Where were you?
MC: Well, I was on Morningside grounds, and talking to a couple of the neighbors, and when we were about ready to part, I stumbled over a little mound of bricks and leaves. I didn't know what it was. I stumbled over it... I stumbled over, yes, some bricks and leaves, and fell forward on my face, right on a shovel that was near. I immediately got up, I wasn't unconscious any length of time, and we simply dispersed—I mean, the two other people that were talking with me—and I went home, and felt all right, and continued to work, as I had been up to this time. Then about three weeks later, one day, in the apartment, I suddenly felt very, very ill. I couldn't explain what happened to me, so I called my doctor and he asked me to come down to his office, and he kept me there, observing me, and finally he felt that I should be hospitalized and have some brain studies made. So they did hospitalize me, in the neurological section of one of the hospitals in New York, and they found that, with the brain scan, or whatever other studies they did, that there was a shadow which...they couldn't quite decide what it was. And they kept me there for about three weeks, taking a series of pictures, and finally this shadow disappeared, and I was discharged from the hospital. But I had a residual left, in that I had a little difficulty in feeling my way in space. I have not been able to cry since the accident. My eyes are dry, and the...
ED: Does that mean no fluid in the tear ducts, or what does that mean?
MC: No, no, the tear ducts are simply drains of fluid from the eye into the nose. But this injury was in the brain itself, way back. A little difficulty in speech at times, but I... After that, I think about three or four weeks later, I went back to work, with my day care center.
ED: Day care centers. That was all you were doing then?
MC: Yes, that's all I was doing then. And then the... No, it was about
eight months later, I developed this acute intestinal obstruction, and as an emergency, had to be operated on the Decoration Day, of all days.
ED: In 1974, this is? I mean 1976?
MC: In '76. And this was quite a protracted illness. I mean, I had lost a good deal of weight. I was put in the emergency unit for quite some time, to stabilize my condition. And then when I came out, I had a very long convalescence and the...
ED: Is this the period you became a little despondent, or decided you just didn't...
MC: Well, I just decided, What was the use of struggling? I wasn't recovering as rapidly as I thought I should, and so that I got in touch﻿73
MC: (cont.) with the Department of Health and asked them to tell me about this illness, and asked them did they want me to resign. And because of my age, and all this sort of thing, they thought maybe it would be better that I did. So I resigned.
ED: I see.
MC: Now, in the meantime...
ED: This would be 1977, about the time you resigned?
MC: That's right. Now, in the meantime, this group of women, as I told you, formed this society, this medical society. And they named it after what they thought was the first Negro woman to practice in New York City.
ED: I see. What was her name?
MC: Her name was Susan Smith McKinney Steward. She practiced under the names of Smith, McKinney, and Steward.
ED: Three different marriages?
MC: The first was her single name—Smith was her... And she practiced under her second—the second name was her first marriage then her husband died. Then she married the second time. She practiced in Brooklyn and in New York City till about 1901. And then she and her husband went to Ohio to...
ED: Wilberforce?
MC: Wilberforce. He was a minister. Then, for a long period of time, there did not appear to be anybody else, and I was accused of being the first Negro woman to practice in New York. But I went to the Schomburg Library
and found out that___the first two that I had mentioned, and that, in
between there were three or four others. But they had left New York and not continued, or they had died, or something.
ED: I see. Now you say the first two—you only mentioned one, this doctor Smith McKinney Steward.
MC: Well, the first one was...Well, I think, Rebecca Cole, I said. That was the first one. I think she was...
ED: Oh, yes. We were off tape then. That's why I wanted you to repeat it. But this group that got together and named their organization...
MC: ..iafter what they thought was the first.
ED: And then, you have discovered since, that there was a previous Negro woman doctor. Now, when did Dr. McKinney Steward, the one after whom the organization is named—and when we say the organization, we mean an organization formed recently of Negro woman doctors. This is the group that honored you.
MC: That's right, and five others.﻿74
ED: And five other doctors. Okay, let's go back just a second. Where did this Dr. McKinney Steward go to school?
MC: Where did she what?
ED: Where did she take her training?
MC: At the hospital that Dr. Blackwell, Dr. [Elizabeth] Blackwell, the first woman, white woman, to study medicine in New York...in America. And she was denied an internship. So she had to go to Europe to get that. In the meantime, her sister studied medicine in Europe, and she stayed for internship, and then they came back to America, and founded the New York Infirmary for Women and Children. That's what it was named first.
ED: And this is where Dr. Steward graduated from?
MC: That's right.
ED: And this other woman doctor that was previous to her, did she go to this same school?
MC: We were never able to find out.
ED: I see. You don't know whether she went to the New York Infirmary or not?
MC: She didn't go there. She may have come from Philadelphia—you know, there was a medical school in Philadelphia for women. But it's been lost some-wheres along the way, and I think all that we know, there was this doctor Rebecca Cole.
ED: She was the first.
MC: She was the first.
ED: And Dr. Steward was the second, and then you said there was a long period of time when apparently there were no Negro women doctors.
MC: That's right. Now, for instance, there was Isabelle Granger. Do you remember her? Her husband was a physician. They were related to the Grangers. There was Isabelle Granger, who until I think about a year ago was still in...but she's been in a nursing home. There was Dr. Agnes
Griffin, and...
ED: These were the women at the luncheon?
MC: Yes. Isabelle was not there, Isabelle Granger. She was in a nursing home. There was Dr. E. Mae McCarroll, you remember her, and there was Dr. Kearse [Myra Smith-Kearse]. I hadn't heard of her, but her daughter has just been appointed as a federal judge—the first Negro woman appointed to that... And then, Dr. Lena Edwards, you see.
ED:
Yes. Now, the Dr. Kearse whose daughter has been appointed, is the daughter's name Kearse, also?﻿75
MC: Yes.
ED: I see.
MC: Yes, that's within the past six weeks.
ED: I see. Wonderful. So these women doctors were honored by this society that has been formed of younger women—of younger women, Negro women doctors.
MC: That's right.
ED: So it was at this luncheon that you sort of got renewed life? Or was it when the New York Times reported it? You said the New York Times sent a reporter to cover, or write it up?
MC ^ Charlayne Hunter came to interview me.
ED: Charlayne Hunter-Gault.
MC: Gault. She came before the luncheon, and she came to the luncheon. And then she wrote the article up, the first article that appeared in the Times. You saw that.
ED: Yes, I did. And that, I believe, is in the fall of 1977, isn't it?
MC: That's right. Well now, in interviewing me, she mentioned the fact that I was writing my history for Fisk University. All the other doctors had been interviewed, but nothing had been said about them writing anything. So this is when the Times picked me up, and they wanted to know about my history. And I told them that I had been asked by Fisk to do a biography of my life, and I had sent them what I had finally gotten together, but I hadn't heard from them, and this was over a year.
ED: So you don't know whether it was received, do you?
MC: I never knew.
ED: Never heard another word.
MC: I even wrote to them and asked them. And I had Anna Hedgeman. But they were going through some kind of revolution down there, I think, and so, evidently, nobody followed up on my letter, my two letters.
ED:	So your piece, that you composed...
MC:	So when I spoke to the Times...
ED:	...is down there.
MC:	I don't know. I don't know.
ED:	But you have a copy.﻿76
MC: I have a copy of it, yes. I had it copyrighted, too, by the way, so at least I have that covered.
ED: Very good. So the New York Times...
MC: Well, the New York Times asked me to send... They felt that since I hadn't heard from them, would I let them see the article? So I sent the article to them, and that's when they suggested that I write an article for the magazine section.
ED: Yes. They sent George Davis to me as a writer. They had previously sent me a colored man. I think I told you about that situation.
ED: I think you told me off tape.
MC: Well, we had two interviews, and instead of keeping the third appointment, he called me up one night and said that he had something that he wanted me to read. So he came to the door, and handed me this envelope. Wouldn't come in. He said, "Read it and I'll get in touch with you at the end of..." And really what it said, that he wanted to take everything over himself, wanted to disconnect himself from the Times. Well, I felt that was being dishonest. So I called up the Times and told them, and said, "I don't think I can work with him, because I think what he's done has been very unsatisfactory." So then they assigned me George Davis.
ED: Oh, he's the one that wrote the article we referred to in the beginning of the interview, which is "The Healing Hand of Harlem."
MC: That's right.
ED: I think that's a beautiful...
MC: We didn't choose the title. The Times chose that title.
ED: The editor of the magazine, or someone in control. I think that's a
wonderful title. Because all while you're talking, over and over again, I've realized, that is what you have been—a healing hand in Harlem.
MC: Well, it's been a very interesting life, as I've told you.
ED: It's been a wonderful life.
MC: I think I told you, I was within three weeks of going to the nursing home...
ED: ...when this occurred.
MC: Yes, that's right.
ED: The luncheon, and then the follow-up article, and the interviews, and
you really took a whole new lease on life. And you decided you weren't going to... You had retired, but you decided that you weren't going to chuck it all and go to a nursing home.﻿77
MC: That's right.
ED: Even though you had picked out the home. Had you made any financial commitments?
MC: Not quite. I had the papers in the house to sign. But I'd had the
necessary interviews, and I had been assured that I did not have enough money to go in, but because I had given so much service to Harlem, that they would make it possible for me to come in, and use what I had.
ED: Isn't that wonderful. Well, I'm certainly glad. We might not—although we might be interviewing you in a nursing home—but we probably wouldn't be sitting here doing this today. I think you told me at one point that you even had sent some of your belongings...
MC: Yes, some of my furniture's still... tags.
ED: Tags. And isn't some of it already gone to the nursing home?
MC: No, no, not gone, but I discussed withthem the hospital bed. I have a special hospital bed, and I had discussed with them the possibilities of using that bed instead of the bed at the home. And they frowned on it, they said, "We can't do that sort of thing." But as I said, I can't sleep unless I sleep in a hospital bed . My head has to be elevated, you see. And so they were considering that. They said...I...making a point.
ED: All these plans were being made. And then, when the luncheon was held, and when the article was written in the Times, and then the article in the Times magazine, and you began to get so much response. Tell us about that.
MC: Oh. Well, I can't begin to tell you the number of letters I had. While I was doing the article for the Times, writing it, one of my former patients has a country home up in Pennsylvania, and they asked me to come up and finish it there. You know what I mean? And while I was there— they had taken me to meet some of the neighbors—and this woman walked in, and I was introduced as Dr. Chinn. "Oh," she said, "you are some distant relative of mine." I didn't tell you about this?
ED: No.
MC: I don't know whether we should tell this on your story, but anyhow...
ED: Maybe it's going to be in the book.
MC: She had married into the Chinn family in which...from the plantation from which my father escaped.
ED: A white woman.
MC: Well, the plantation, in Virginia, surely.
ED: Right, right. Well, we want to make it clear. I think we did talk about﻿78
ED: (cont.) this at the beginning of the tape. Yes, we did, when we were finding out about the two Chinns.
MC: Yes. Well, at any rate, she insisted upon it, so I told her, "Be sure and tell him that I'm the daughter of one of their escaped slaves." "Oh," she said, "I'm going to..." And three weeks after I got home, the present owner of the plantation sent me the autobiography of the Chinn family. That's...thick. [She demonstrates the thickness.]
ED: Roots did a lot for us in this country, didn't it? People are now acknowledging things they didn't...
MC:
ED:
MC:
ED
And in the past three or four months, I have a letter from another branch of the Chinn family—that is not Chinn from the South, that is related to this, asking me to tell [him] something about my heritage, that he wants to include me in his family tree.
Isn't that something? How about, have you heard from any black people, or any Negro people, who say they're related to you?
Oodles of letters. Patients from all over the world, really, to the point that...
Patients, and people who say they're related to you?
MC: That's right—related, and friends.
ED: Who haven't kept up with you?
MC: That's right. The article came out on the twenty-second of May...
ED: April, I think.
MC: April. The twenty-third of April, which was the following Monday, at
eight o'clock in the morning, I got a telephone call from a former patient of mine that had read the article in the Bahamas. And she said as soon as she got into New York, she called me from the airport to say that she'd read the article.
ED: Isn't that something. How about the little schoolchildren?
MC: Oh, that was a beautiful thing. Then, of course, from all over the
United States, and the... I told you aboutthe schoolchildren. Did I tell you about the letter from the Chinese woman doctor that I used to work with at Memorial?
ED: No, I don't think so.
MC: That was the most fantastic thing of all. There was a Chinese woman
doctor that I worked with at Memorial, and she left for mainland China in 1949. We tried to get her not to go back, because the Communists were beginning to come in. I went to Europe that year, and stayed in Paris for three months, and while I was in Paris, I got this letter that she had sent to my address at 409. It was forwarded to me, to Paris,﻿79
MC:
ED: MC:
ED:
ED:
MC:
ED MC
(cont.) and in this letter, she said that she could already hear the booming of the Communist army coming into China. She was confiscated, she was imprisoned, she was moved further and further into the interior, and was never allowed to do anything but just give the anatomy of the arm. She taught anatomy of the arm. That's another long story. But I just wanted to say that about six weeks ago, I got a letter from her.
ED: Is she still in China? MC:
She's still in China, and not only that, but she sent me the address that I'm to write to her in Chinese, and she said, "You just write my name about it, because where I am located, nobody reads English here, and I'm so anxious to get your letter."
And had she read the article? Is this the reason for writing the letter?
Well, just sheer luck, one of her sisters lives in the Morningside project', and she sent the article to her sister. Isn't that the most fantastic thing you ever heard of?
It certainly is. No wonder your life got turned around, with all of this. And then I think you told us, and I'm not sure whether it's on tape] about BBC [British Broadcasting Corporation] getting in touch with you because of your acquaintance with Paul Robeson, and how interested they were in knowing all they could about Paul Robeson.
MC: Yes, that's right.
I don't know whether on tape you told us much of the intimate detail— and maybe intimate is not the word I want—but more of the personal description of Robeson the man when you knew him. Is there anything...
Well, you see, I had to go into that... I've shared that with my writer. Yes, you see.
ED:	And that's going to be in the book.
MC:	That's going to be in the book, yes.
ED:	That's something we will all enjoy...
MC:	Because I knew Paul and his wife before they married.
ED:	Eslanda.
MC:	You see, Essie Goode and I worked at the Presbyterian Hospital. She was going to be a doctor too at one time.
She had registered, she had taken one year at medical school, at P & S. And had stayed out one day over what they allow. And they told her that she could return to the school, but she'd have to repeat her first year. And instead of doing that, she didn't go back.﻿80
ED: And she married Paul, and didn't become a doctor?
MC: That's right. And they were married for about a year before anybody knew about it.
ED: Oh, is that so? A secret marriage. Well, we'll all look forward to
hearing that. So we're up to this period since '77, that you have been really involved...
MC: In this.
ED: ...in this, haven't you?
MC: Yes, and then you know, the strike came...
ED: The newspaper strike.
MC: Yes, and that delayed it.
ED: Oh, the article was to be published before that.
MC: Yes.
ED: There are a few questions I'd like to ask you as we bring this to a close, and some of them I've been able to intersperse into the narrative of your life. You mentioned at one point Saint Philip's Church where you taught— Sunday school?
MC: Yes, that's right.
ED: Were either of your... Well, your father, you said, was an atheist.
MC: That's right.
ED: Was your mother religious?
MC: She was so tired that she never went to church. We finally got her...
because we lived two doors from Saint Philip's at one time, and we finally got her to go to a confirmation class, and she was confirmed.
ED: As an Episcopalian?
MC: Yes. I have at home...
ED: Pardon me, where did you live?
MC: I have at home a Bible that she gave me, with my...that she had...wrote, "To my daughter May," "To my little girl May," or something like that, with the date she gave it to me. Because when she was confirmed I gave her a Bible, you see. But she never attended because she was tired. She was just...﻿81
ED: She had to use her weekends to rest—if she wasn't ironing clothes
or doing something else. Understandable. Where did you live when you were two doors from Saint Philip's? Saint Philip's Church, let's identify for our reading audience...
MC: The number was 224 West 134th Street. This is when they had moved uptown, you know. They were way downtown when I first...
ED: Oh, I see. You went to Saint Philip's when they were way downtown— in the sixties, weren't they?
MC: I think it was even further down. This is when I was a little bit of a girl.
ED: How did you happen to go to that church?
MC: Well, little people that lived around, children that lived around, and...
ED: That was when you were in San Juan Hill, did they call that area, or?
MC: Quite likely, yes.
ED: Mm hmm. Way downtown. Then the church moved uptown, and you found yourself living next door to it.
MC: Yes, that's right.
ED: Were you an active member of the church?
MC: Oh, yes. I taught Sunday school there. I studied pipe organ with the organist there.
ED: Do you remember his name?
MC: Paul Bolden.
ED: Mr. Bolden, right. Dr. Bolden, I think he was later called.
MC: Yes, Dr. Bolden, that's right.
ED: And that was when Shelton Hale Bishop, Sr., was the minister.
MC: Was the minister, that's right.
ED: And then he was succeeded by his son, and now by Moran Weston, Dr. Moran Weston. That's my church, too—that's why I'm interested... So, have you remained a member of Saint Philip's?
MC: No, because when Shelton, the son, was ready to come in...
ED: Shelton Hale, Jr., Shelton Hale Bishop.
MC: Yes. But you know, there had been a minister with the elder, who...﻿82
MC: (cont.) Dr. Daniels. He had been there for twenty-five years.
ED: With Shelton Hale, Sr., Shelton Hale Bishop, Sr.
MC: That's right. And we felt that he had to have a set place for his son, so he got rid of Daniels. And at that time I came out of the church, because I was so hurt to think that that would happen. That a minister that stood in the pulpit trying to tell me what to do would do a thing like that. So it split the church in half.
ED: Is that so? Many people came out of it at that time.
MC: That's right, I came out at that time.
ED: They disagreed with that decision.
MC: And then when I had my office at 44 Edgecombe, there was a little
chapel—Saint Luke's, I think, chapel—that I would go there, but I didn't join it.
ED: It's on Convent Avenue?
MC: On Edgecombe Avenue.
ED: On Edgecombe. There's a Saint Luke's Episcopal Church now on 141st and Convent Avenue.
MC:
ED: MC: ED:
MC:
ED:
ED
MC: ED:
Well I think it probably is an extension of that, I'm not... But anyhow, this little chapel was the people that came out of the church.
And did Father Daniels pastor that group of...
No, he went on to Detroit, and he got a calling there.
So this little group of dissidents—or the big group of dissidents—went to Saint Luke's chapel there on Edgecombe.
That's right. And then I didn't join a church again until I went over to Morningside Gardens, and the sounding of the bells in the morning, Sunday morning, gave me the kind of an atmosphere, and I joined Riverside Church, and I am a member of Riverside Church now.
A wonderful church, isn't it?
MC: Yes.
And now Bill Coffin, William Sloane Coffin, is your new minister there. He's a wonderful man.
Yes, he certainly is.
I like to go there too, very, very much. I was there the day he was installed.﻿83
MC: Oh, you were?
ED: It was a wonderful service.
MC: I think I was there, too. I'm not sure.
ED: Reverend Wyatt Tee Walker was part of the installation. So that was one question that was on my mind, what happened as far as the religious aspect of your life was concerned. You haven't expressed any indications of bitterness throughout the interview.
MC: No, I haven't, because I haven't had time. You know, I've been busy.
The only trouble that I had was the trouble that my mother had, to try to get enough time to rest. So that I didn't have time to be bitter. You know what I mean? I just, I've never been bitter for some reason or other. I have just felt that I try to think through a situation, and it seemed to have worked out without harming anybody, and without being boisterous or malicious or anything like that. So I never took up the cudgels. Maybe it's... I don't know what you would call it, but...
ED: I think you explained it very well when you say you were always so busy.
You were very conscious of the need to make a living, all through college you were having to work. When you became a doctor you were suffering the... Well, you weren't suffering, you were experiencing—I suppose you were suffering to some extent—the pain of the neglect and recognition by the other doctors. But you were so busy taking care of your patients and yourself that you just didn't sit home and nurse your wounds. You kept on.
MC: I just kept on.
ED: MC:
ED:
You had a very positive life.
I didn't have time to twiddle my thumbs or anything like that, you know. It was always something...
You didn't have time to play, you were busy being a doctor and learning more all the time. And you don't seem to have experienced loneliness.
MC: Not at all.
ED: No, you had your music, for one thing. And your patients and your love
of'medicine. And you seem like a very happy, fulfilled, wonderful woman.
MC* Well, that's... I don't know what else to say, but that's the way I think it's worked out.
ED- It's the expression on your face, too, and your demeanor as you sit
and talk. And, really, what you've shared with us is quite inspiring.
MC- Well, funny thing, I've never thought of it that way. It's just simply that'some days the decisions were hard... But as I say, the funny thing﻿84
MC: (cont.) is, if I had a problem—and I've experienced this all through my life—that if I couldn't solve it during the day, I finally went to bed at night, and maybe the next morning, or two or three mornings after that, what I should do was present in my mind. And if I followed that, it worked out all right.
ED: Isn't that great:? Isn't that wonderful and fortunate? I guess it's really also part of the orderliness of your life? It's almost like applying the scientific method, isn't it, to a problem?
MC: Something... For instance, you can expect immediate results by being
hostile and breaking everything out, and just... But I've never thought... I have just felt that, well, let's think this thing through. And as I say, it was usually, the solution to the problem was, this was the way that I should go. And if I followed it, it worked out all right. I don't know, I...
ED: I imagine this was very helpful, as a doctor, to your patients...
MC: Oh, yes.
ED: ...to have this attitude, because I'm sure that as they brought their problems to you, their illnesses, you applied this in helping them work through some of their solutions, too, didn't you?
MC: Oh, yes. Well, that's been one of the joys of having the nineteen godchildren, you knew., In other words, what's happened is that many times they would come to me with their little problems when they wouldn't take it to their parents, you know. We'd sit down and talk it over, and they would ask me this, and I would let them talk it out. And we became very close. And really, to this day, I've been able to put my hands on about nine of my godchildren that, every once in a while, I hear from, or see...
ED: You told us one, Franklin Williams... [Franklin H. Williams]
MC: That's right.
ED: Are there any others that are names that we might recognize?
MC: Well, there is... I don't know whether I should mention this name, but do you remember Attorney Penn and his wife? She was a schoolteacher, and he was a lawyer from Harvard?
ED: Was that Emma Penn?
MC: Emma Penn, yes. Well, their daughter, I delivered her, and she is a
physician now, doing research work in neurology. I see her about every two or three years.
ED: MC:
Yes. She's one of your godchildren?
No, she's not a godchild, but she's one of the patients that have kept﻿85
MC: (cont.) in touch with me, every once in a while. In other words, she wanted to set her office up with me at one time. And then she decided to go into neurology, and got into pure research work. So she's doing research work in neurology, and teaching at Columbia medical school in neurology. Has been for a number of years now.
ED: Mrs. Penn is still living, is she not? Down in Virginia?
MC: Yes, in Virginia. They gave up their home on 122nd Street, and retired.
ED: Right. She was very active in the YWCA.
MC: Oh, indeed, yes.
ED: She was the one that, when I went on the national board of the Y, she was the one who made the call to ask me to come on, and we were very close over the years.
MC: Then of course, Reverend Hill—his son, I took care of him. I didn't deliver him, but I took care...
ED: First name of his son?
MC: Well, Nora Hill was his wife. She had charge of the Y at one time, but the new Y...Reverend—what is his first name? He just died about two or three years ago. But their son, I took care of him from the time he came back from the hospital, from being delivered—I didn't deliver him. But he keeps in touch with me. And now he has charge of all the airplane activities for Pan Am in Africa. Did you know that? He's had that job for, oh, I think about seven or eight years now.
ED: That's a wonderful piece of information.
MC: Yes, so that so many of them are doing outstanding things, you know.
ED: You can sit back, whenever you're quiet for a moment, and think about your patients. Were the majority of your patients women or men?
MC: I had about a half-and-half practice, and even to the time I retired.
ED: One would think that a woman doctor would have 90 percent women patients, wouldn't one?
MC: Well, I did not like to take care of men, I'll tell you frankly. So I tried to get rid of them. Some of them I couldn't. And one of my stories that I'll tell in the book was a story that's very much related to the story about syphilis, this experimental work that was done by... I had a similar case. Not exactly a similar case, but I had a case that I...I'm going to try to put in words so that it's not going to hurt anybody's feelings. I'm not going to mention any name. But it's a very interesting case that I... Well, I won't tell you about it, because it is a fantastic story.﻿86
ED: But it is going to be in the book? Oh, I tell you, people are going to feel like I feel, that we can't wait for the book. But you say 50 percent of your patients were men?
MC: No, no, no. I thought you meant colored and white.
ED: No, men and women.
MC: No, no, I had very few men patients, as I...I tried to get rid of them as soon as I could.
ED: No, I think we misunderstood each other. So that 95 percent of your patients were women?
MC: That's right. Women and children.
ED: Women and children. But as far as Negro and Caucasian, it was about fifty-fifty.
MC: That's right.
ED: Right up until the time that you retired. So these white women patients came to Harlem?
MC: That's right.
ED: To you. They came to 409...
MC: They came up to 409, they came to 44. Surely.
ED: They came to 44, they came to 409... These are patients that you developed in your hospital.
MC: And their families, you see. That's right.
ED: And their families. And they also came to 409. And how about 100 LaSalle Street?
MC: Oh, yes. That's where I retired. Yes, right. That was the time I retired.
ED: So you had a truly interracial practice.
MC: I really did.
ED: I don't think this was brought out in the article, "Healing Hand in Harlem."
MC: No, because there was some of it, they had to cut the article down.
ED: You wrote the article, and then George Davis...
MC: Well, we wrote it together.﻿87
ED: You wrote it together. You talked to him, or you wrote certain things?
MC: Well, the fir st draft that he submitted to me left out so many important things, that I wrote what I would like to have. Now after we submitted his and my draft, the Times cut some of it out, because of the length of it, you see.
ED: Well, fortunately, a lot of that will be in the book, which we hope is going to be...
MC: Now, I don't know how this is going to turn out for the book, whether he's going to take full credit... It doesn't matter to me, you know. And as I said, as far as the title went, the Times themselves chose the title, because we didn't have any title.
ED: Yes, the title for the article. Do you have a title for the book yet?
MC: No, we don't.
ED: You're still going to let that develop as time goes on.
MC: Yes.
ED: Well, Dr. Chinn, in closing, there's one other thing I'd like to—well, there are two things, really, and I hope we have time on this tape. Could you tell us a little bit—you've told us quite a bit—about Harlem in the days that you were... In the earlier days, let's say, prior to the sixties. We know a lot about it from the sixties on. But you already spoke of the Renaissance. That must have been a great period, the twenties, wasn't it?
MC: It certainly was.
ED: Langston Hughes, DuBois, Countee Cullen, and so forth. Did you know all of these people?
MC: Very well. We were... I just read a book recently about somebody...
wrote about that period. And they said the dignified families of Harlem ate at their own homes, that they never went to these little small places. Now this group that we speak about just now, we used to go to these little store things, in which there was a round table and a chair, and a candle on the table. And Countee Cullen or Langston Hughes or Jean Toomer would recite...
ED: Claude McKay?
MC: Claude McKay. Would recite, back and forth, their writings. And we
would correct it and add a point or two. So this was the kind of thing that we did, you see.
ED: Some of those little places we know the names of, don't we...
MC: Oh, I don't think they...﻿88
ED: Oh, I can remember one name, there...near the YMCA, on Seventh Avenue?
MC: There were four or five of them.
ED: Yes, right around in that 135th Street area.
MC: That's right.
ED: There was one...I moved to New York in 1932, and the Renaissance was
more or less coming to a close. But I remember one little restaurant— and I can't think of the name of it—but you still heard of the gatherings there. But not as intimately as you've just described. I didn't realize that. And how about Dark Tower? Was there a place called Dark Tower?
MC: Oh, yes. That was a little...
ED: It was the home of someone.
MC: That's right.
ED: Madame Walker? No.
MC: Well, no, she had her... I don't know whether they called her place or not. But she had these very exotic type of things.
ED: That was Madame Walker.
MC: Yes.
ED: Was that a house on 136th Street?
MC: 136th Street. And Paul and I often went and sang and played at her little recitals.
ED: Is that so. And she would have all of these well-known people in...
MC: You know one of the famous stories about that was that this English
titled man came to Harlem. When he got off the boat, he said, "I must go to Harlem to see this woman." She gave parties practically two or three nights a week. And the place was always crowded, people coming in and out. So this man insisted upon going up there, and when he got there, the place was just like it always is—doors open and people were coming in and out. And he finally sent word up that Lord So-and-so was downstairs to see her. He waited a little while, and nothing happened. So he sent it up three different times. And the last time he sent it, he got a little note that was handed to him saying, "See that Lord So-and-so gets part of the food." And he never got to meet her. That's right.
ED: [laughs] This was Madame Walker, the famous Madame Walker.
MC: This was Madame Walker, 136th Street. She had a gold piano that was hand painted. Oh, it was a gorgeous thing.﻿89
ED: Did you play on that piano?
MC: I played on that piano...
ED: When you accompanied Paul, and when you sang yourself? What days those must have been.
MC: Yes, they really were. We could always get in and out, Paul and I,
you know, because Paul was large, he could... And of course, I would always be right by his side. So we always got up to where we were going.
ED: Quite a difference in height, too. Big, tall Paul.
MC: Oh, I'm telling you.
ED: And the Cotton Club was flourishing.
MC: Yes. 'Course I never got to that, you know, my father was opposed to me seeing cabaret life anyway. And as I say, I was working, so that I never did get to any of those places.
ED: When Lena Home sang there, I remember, in the thirties. The Apollo was active, and Dicky Wells's place, where so many people went to eat and have a good time.
MC: Yes, that's right. And then when I was in college, there was a Lafayette Theater where they had these little plays. I occasionally got to see one of those.
ED: That's being restored now. It's been restored, and it's the home of the Negro Repertory Theater, I believe.
MC: Oh, is it? In the same building?
ED: In the same building, in the restored Lafayette Theater. Well, much has been written about those days in Harlem. But it's always nice to hear, to talk to someone who was intimately acquainted with them.
The war. Was there much effect of World War I on your life? Let's see, you were entering college.
MC: Well, I sang for the soldiers. They had a USO for Negroes in Harlem. I sang whenever I had a chance, to the soldiers.
ED: This is World War I.
MC: Yes, World War I. And I went to Fort Dix to sing for them there. You see, this was when I was in music. So many of the 369th that made it, this group from Harlem, and Negroes from other places, were personal friends of mine, so that we saw them off, and we saw them come back. I mean, that sort of thing.
ED: Oh, yes, off to the war and back. And that great parade, I guess.﻿90
MC: Yes, yes. It wasn't exactly an auxiliary, but we sort	of looked after them. They had a place, I think, on 132nd Street, one flight up, where
they would congregate, you know. When they came back,	they were trying to get jobs and things like that.
ED: And World War II, you lived through that, of course.
MC: World War II was when I was interning and, let's see, World War II— no, I was practicing, the very first time. And there, what happened was, some of the men, older men, got into the army, and some of the younger people got into some of the clinics. Because the hospital needed the hospitals staffed, you see.
ED: So the impact there was an economic one, wasn't it?
MC: That's right. We didn't get paid for it, but that was that.
ED: And with many of the doctors off to war, did that have an effect on
your being used, also? With doctors being in medical units overseas, did that mean that the work of the doctors left at home was greater, and the opportunities were expanded?
MC: Oh, yes indeed. Well, you see, the white doctors...[break] ...and the doctors from the West Indian islands were coming in.
ED: And having...
MC: And having the opportunity.
ED: Yes, okay.
MC: You see, and a couple of doctors from India that were very dark—you know, if you were pigmented, you were a Negro, even if they had an odd name.
ED: Well, our tape is coming to a close, and I think we won't turn over to the other side, but I just want to thank you for the Black Women's Oral History Project and...
MC: Thank you, well, I hope it's...
ED: And you will have a copy of this tape, and also a typed copy. They will do a transcript, and you will approve it before it is accepted by the library. If there's anything you want to delete, you can. So, thank you very, very much, Dr. Chinn. I have really enjoyed...I asked for this assignment.
MC: You did? Oh, wonderful.
ED: Yes. I mean, they named a whole list of names, and I said, "Well, let me do Dr. Chinn, because I know her."
MC: Marvelous.﻿91
ED: Thank you very much.
MC: Thank you. Thank you for the opportunity. ED: You're quite welcome.
ED: After completing this tape, Dr. Chinn received a letter from Washington, D.C., from an agency... The letter was written on August 15, 1979. It reads: "Dear Dr. Chinn, Our magazine, America Illustrated, which is an official publication of the International Communication Agency, formerly known as the USIA, United States Information Agency, and is distributed by the American embassy in the Soviet Union, America Illustrated is is reproducing a story called "A Healing Hand in Harlem" from the New York Times Magazine." And of course, we know that this is the article about Dr. Chinn. "We would like to use the pictures of you which appeared in the article, some of which are from your scrapbooks." Dr. Chinn has agreed to participate and allow the use of these pictures, and so this is one more example of the expansion of the knowledge about Dr. Chinn, which has gone now...will go now throughout, further in the world. And at this point, she will be read about by the people who read this magazine in the Soviet Union. If any of us are capable of reading in Russian— and I have a granddaughter who's planning to major in Russian; maybe someday she will read this article to me—but if any of us are capable of reading Russian, of course, we can read the article, if we are in the Soviet Union. However, we did want to add this to the tape because, as I said before, it shows the international aspects of Dr. Chinn's life, at this point. This is now the end of the tape on Dr. May Chinn, a most remarkable women.﻿MAY CHINN
