 Little Thunder. Today is December 11, 2011, and  I   m interviewing Kelly Haney at his home in Norman, Oklahoma. Kelly,  you   ve had an amazing career as a politician on the state and tribal  level. You   re a businessman, but most people know you as an artist, and  they continue to prize your artwork which now includes many sculptures  as well as paintings. Thank you for taking the time to talk with me.  Thank you very much.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  I was born at home in Seminole County, northwest of the city of  Seminole, near a little place called Turkey Creek, November 12, 1940.  Any brothers or sisters?  I have two brothers and two sisters. Two of them are now deceased, one  brother and one sister, so I still have one brother and one sister.  How about your earliest memories of doing art?  Well, I have always done art. First of all, I acknowledge that what I have  is God-given. I didn   t choose to have this art ability. I just do. If I can  think it in my head, I   ve got all these little messages going down to my  fingertips to create what   s in my mind. It sounds simplistic, but for me  and many artists who do many kinds of art, whether it   s writing or visual  arts or even dance, I think they visualize what they have in the mind  first, and then interpret in the form that they choose.  How about your folks? What did they do for a living?  Oh, many things. (Laughs). My father in my early years was in World  5  Little Thunder  Haney  War II. When he came home, he started farming. It was at that time and  period in our history when the government was trying to make farmers  out of Indians. He was a good farmer, but one year things didn   t turn  out, and we left the farm and went to town. Eventually, he became a  minister of the United Methodist Church. It was a Methodist church at  the time, the Indian Missionary Conference. He was there for some  thirty-five, forty years as a minister. In the meanwhile, he was a great  storyteller. He was well known for that. He was a flute maker and a  jeweler among other things, so the fact that I have this art ability, it   s  almost hereditary. It   s like I remember my grandfather and grandmother  doing arts and so forth.  He became a minister. For many years he served in the ministry. While  he wasn   t seminary-trained, he was very bright. He was an avid reader.  After having gone to school, I had planned to go into the ministry. I had  a lot of background studies in the ministry and theology. Knowing that  and knowing what he believed and thought, it   s amazing that he  understood as well as he did about the Bible and about the message that  comes from the Bible. He was very good at that.  He also, in his later life, became an instructor at Bacone College in the  language department for the Muscogee language. He wrote some of the  curriculum. He made his flutes. He played at the Tulsa Philharmonic,  and he had also performed in Kennedy Center in Washington DC. He  did some bit pieces in movies and so forth. He just was a handsome man  with long white hair, and he   d fit right in.  He had a third-grade education. That really tells me and others about the  way life is. Because you don   t have the opportunity to get a formal  education doesn   t mean you   re not smart. He had the ability to learn and  know and to dream and visualize what he could do. He did as much as  he could with the skills he had, probably much more than most people  today.  My mother had an eighth grade education. From Mother, I had two  things. One, my dad understood and talked about our history and about  the ceremony grounds and so forth, but Mother lived it. She was there,  she lived it, and she knew the importance of our culture. From my  mother, I learned the value of work. I think that   s probably a great thing  because you cannot get along and succeed in life unless you know how  to work. I have that ability. I can   t slow down today because I just keep  working. (Laughter)  So when you were in primary and secondary school     Let me go back just a second and finish with my mother. My mother,  6  Little Thunder  Haney  she had never had to work because during the time she was growing up,  oil was plentiful in Seminole County, and her father, my grandfather,  had some oil on his property. It produced a lot of revenue for them, and  they took care of other families then in those times when it was needed.  She grew up rather roughly, but after he was deceased and the oil went  away and she married my dad, she had to learn how to work, and she  did. She went to work at odd jobs, and eventually she became a nurse   s  aide. She was at St. Francis Hospital in Tulsa for many, many years. She  just loved the place, loved her work.  Unbeknownst to us, she was in her sixties, and she went and got her  GED. To me, that means she did place a value, a high value, on  education, the fact that at that age she was willing to go back and never  told anybody. She just worked it out. She was kind of funny in the sense  that she would prefer to speak our language, and she would carry on  with other people like she didn   t know English. Well, she could work a  crossword puzzle, and I can   t. (Laughter) She was pretty slick, I   d say.  (Laughs) She was a bright, bright lady. The question always does come  up, when did I first start art, and she   s obviously the one who knows. I  asked her one day, and she said,    Kelly, when you were two years old,  you were able to sit down and draw what you saw.    So, like I say, it   s  just a natural gift.  We did a lot of community fishing in the rivers and big sand basins, and  I used to carve  in the sand beaches . Living in the country, we all had  knives because that   s what you used as one of your tools. I learned how  to make tool items, and I was six years old when I made my first  sculpture. So the question,    When did you start sculpting?    I was six  years old. That   s what, sixty-five years ago? (Laughter)  Our home was on a dirt road at the time. It was red mud. My sister  would make pies. I got to pushing around and found out,    Hey, I can  make things.    I made the head of Abraham Lincoln. It was about this  tall. (Gestures) It had a hat and tie. I have no idea today why I selected  that person, but I did. My mother, she went and bought me little paints,  cheap paints and brushes, and I remember painting it. She was my  biggest supporter in terms of helping me to develop my skill. We didn   t  have much, but whatever she could afford in the way of drawing and art  supplies, she would make sure that I got something to work with. She  probably got tired of me drawing on her walls. (Laughter) So that   s kind  of her history, just a summary.  Did you have any art classes in school, or not too much?  Well, in the rural areas, you just don   t have art. A bunch of them don   t  have art today, unfortunately. But we moved to Shawnee. Dad was  7  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  trying to find work, and Mom was, too, so I went to school at Shawnee  at Washington School. Then somehow by fifth grade, I had gone to  Harrison School in Shawnee Public Schools. They had a formal art class.  I started taking formal art classes, and I began to understand the  principles of art, which the teacher took time to do with me.  One of the amazing things about that period, though, I looked around  and saw a print of Drawbridge by Van Gogh, Mona Lisa, Whistler   s  Mother, and Blue Boy by Gainsborough, all these different prints around  the room. I have had in my lifetime the opportunity to see the originals  of all of those images. Of course, I was seeking them out when I   d go.  It was quite an experience, and she was very helpful to me. I found that I  had that little niche that people enjoyed, and I enjoyed doing it. It was at  that time I started selling drawings. The kids would want me to draw  something, so if they had a quarter, I   d draw whatever they wanted me  to. (Laughter)  That was your first sale.  Yes, that was my first sale, I believe. Actually, it was younger than that.  I had my uncle who came and watched me. He was an artist, himself. He  came down and saw my work, and he   d give me fifty cents for  something. It was just his way of encouraging me, I think. So, yes, I   ve  been selling art for a long time.  In high school, were you still selling, and people getting you to do  posters or     I didn   t in school, and I went to junior high in Shawnee, and they  continued to have a formal art class. The teacher, Bill Malone, is still  living and is one of my great friends. He took a special interest in me, as  well. I was able to utilize that training in school to develop my skill. I  moved to the high school, and they had what you call trade art, which  meant that I could take art three hours a day in the afternoon. I   d take all  my regular courses, but I could take art, and I took the art. I think that  was probably the beginning of my more formal understanding of what  art principles and concepts were, so that was very helpful.  I moved back to Seminole. In that rural area they no longer had art, but I  kept it up. I would play basketball, ran track, and played baseball, go to  school. At night, I would go into my room, and I would draw and paint  and just self-study.  You went on to Bacone for a year. Was it a year or two?  8  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  I did. I went two years. I graduated with their program there at Bacone  College. I studied art under Dr. Dick West, who was a very prominent  artist, one of the great leaders of the Indian art movement in history. He  is a wonderful man, funny person, great artist. I was able to learn many  things under his instructions.  I might say, too, it was at that time when I started mostly doing Indian  art. I really didn   t do much Indian art, if any, until I went to Bacone  College and I began to understand Indian history a little bit and the  importance of how you do it, at least his style of art.  My  styles have  changed over the years, but it was important for me at that time to know  what he had to teach me.  So did you try to do a little bit of the so-called flat style?  I did. I   m very good at it, quite frankly. It was simple and easy to do, but  mostly because   the hardest part for me is drawing. Today, it   s hard. It  takes a while to finally get exactly what I want. Once I do that, the rest is  easy, at least for me. Painting, sculpting, the rest just comes easy. I   ve  just got to make the form. I   m really cautious when I   m doing realism to  make sure that the anatomy is correct. I   m working on a horse right now,  and I   ve got to know every bone structure, every muscle structure of a  horse. I have one special one. I take hundreds of pictures of every little  part of that horse. I spend a lot of time in research.  That   s different than the early times of Indian art. At the time I was  studying art at Bacone, Indian art was considered flat with lines   defining the objects or persons . It   s what I call a coloring book  concept. That was easy for me to conquer. Just the drawing part was  difficult. Once I did that, I was very successful in winning many  competitions.  You entered the Philbrook Annual.  I entered and won at the Philbrook  Museum . I had entered many  competitions, Five Civilized Tribes  Museum . I have a nice collection  of memories of awards that I   ve won over the years using that style.  That was not who I was. That   s not my style, but that   s what Indian art  was considered. I partially made a living out of it. It helped me get  through school, so that   s what I did.  Later on, I started working with my own style. That came after the art  instructions at the University of Arizona at Tucson. At that time, I had  received a scholarship, the Rockefeller Foundation Scholarship. There  were nineteen Indian artists across the country selected to go to that  school for training. They took care of all of our expenses, planes, room,  9  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  food. They just took care of everything.  I took several classes. One was in jewelry making. I can   t hardly believe  it today, but they had slabs and slabs of silver and turquoise and just  anything and everything we needed to learn. I took some oil painting  classes, which I had already, but I began to develop my skill there.  Two things happened that I recall about that. One of my instructors in  the jewelry business was Charles Loloma. Charles was one of the great  jewelers who started this whole movement of contemporary Indian  jewelry. I say he started it. There may have been others, but he   s the one  I remember who was doing that, and that was great. He said,    You  know, you don   t have to do it the old way. You   re an artist. You   re an  individual. You   re an Indian. You can do anything you want to because  that   s who you are.    That was important.  The other instructor was Fritz Scholder, who was considered one of the  premier abstract painters of Indian subjects in the world. He was a young  man at the time, but he was the instructor there. My art went beyond my  own understanding of what I liked     Out of realism into        what I had learned about traditional, yes, from flat two-dimensional to  realism. Then I began to understand this concept of contemporary  abstract art. I have done abstract art, and I enjoy doing it. I just don   t  have the time. My whole life, basically, is based on time management  because of my background and what I do.  After your training at the university in Arizona, did you step into art as a  professional, full-time, or did you do some other things?  Well, I came back to Oklahoma City University and pursued my original  goals. That was to develop my art skills, but also for the ministry. I have  a lot of background in the schools of theology and so forth. I had that.  All of that is important because I paint what I think about life. My life  can be considered complicated, but for me it   s not. It   s just the way I am  and who I am. I did learn at OCU. They allowed me at that point to just  do what I wanted to do.  I did a mixture of sometimes doing traditional flat paintings, and other  times I   d do abstracts. I kind of ran the range. I guess I was looking for  my own style. That was important, and I learned a lot. OCU has been a  great inspiration to me over the years. I was on the board of trustees for  OCU for a number of years and got an honorary doctorate from OCU in  law of all things. Of course, I was in the legislature twenty-two years.  10  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  That   s obvious that I know a little bit about it. (Laughter)  When I was still at OCU, I went to work for J. C. Penney Company in  downtown Oklahoma City. That was in 1962, late    62. I went in to work  two weeks to help them with Christmas decorations. In the meanwhile,  the manager quits, and the assistant manager comes in, and for the first  time I heard,    Mr. Haney, would you like to be a display manager?    I  didn   t hesitate. I said,    Yes, sir.    I had no idea what I was doing. You  just go.  So for several years I worked in that industry in display management,  and it gave me a better understanding about how to work with people,  understanding that I grew up in a very traditional Indian environment.  The language that was spoken was our Native language. I was with my  aunts, uncles, grandparents, and other people in the community who  were Native people. Those who grew up during that period in the way I  did will understand that it was a little difficult to talk to non-Indians.  I was still in that transition phase whenever they gave me this job, and I  learned that people, no matter who they are, they   re willing to help me  do my job. They didn   t care that I was Indian. They just wanted to make  sure that I did my job right because if I did my job right, they got to sell  more things. So it all worked out really good. I learned a lot from that  company. The young man who hired me who was assistant manager at  the time went on to transfer to New York City. He eventually became  the chair of the J. C. Penney Board worldwide. We ran into each other  years later, he being who he was and me being a state senator, and we  had the best time. (Laughter)  Pretty amazing. Your background in finance   had you taken a few  finance classes at OCU?  I didn   t. Most of mine was really centered around liberal education and  religion. I was working, not necessarily in art but in community  development at the time. I was looking for another job opportunity, and I  was called by this person who became a friend of mine. I had  interviewed with him earlier. He called and said,    Mr. Haney, we   d like  for you to apply for this training that is going to take place in  Philadelphia.    I said,    Well, for what purpose?    It was for an economic  developer. I said,    What the hell is an economic developer?    I didn   t  know. (Laughter) He told me,    It   s to help create businesses in inner  cities because of the current situation and to develop those skills.    They  paid a nice stipend. They paid for everything. I had a family, too,  though, so I had to consider that.  Was this in the mid-   70s?  11  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  I   m trying to remember. Late    60s? I think it was the late    60s. I went to  school in Philadelphia at the Progress Management Institute. The  instructors there came from Temple University in their Business  Department and the Wharton School of Business and Finance.  Instructors would come and instruct us in special programs designed  specifically for these men and women that are training to go back in  different cities across the country.  Everyone had a degree in business. (Laughter) Some had master   s  degrees. I came out at the top of the class. I   ve never worked as hard as I  did, but it came easy. Business concepts and so forth, it   s something that  really comes to me as easy as art does. I haven   t had enough time to  work at it as I would like to have. As you know, becoming Chairman of  Appropriations, I have certainly had an opportunity to deal with issues  of finance and budgets and so forth.  So you worked for J. C. Penney, and you took that training in  Philadelphia. You continued, I guess, doing your artwork?  I   ve always done my artwork, since two years old. For me, art is like  breathing. I just do it. It   s like I have no choice. You get up and you  breathe. I get up, and I   ve got to do some sort of art, at least think a  concept through.  Did you put your work in any Oklahoma galleries to start with?  I did. I had it in several galleries. Five Civilized Tribes Museum in  Muskogee probably has the largest collections of my early originals,  then Gilcrease and other galleries across the state. Then I had an  opportunity to exhibit in California. I was an early exhibitor in Santa Fe,  and I was a prize winner in painting at that time.  At Indian Market in Santa Fe?  Indian Market. Then when I became a legislator, everything stopped. My  art didn   t stop. It really reduced the amount of time I could spend with it,  so I just did it locally. My market has always been good locally. Of  course, I   ve developed that.  When you entered in Santa Fe, you had found your voice with this more  realistic style that we know you for.  Right, right, right. It was realism. People there seemed to like it. Of  course, at Santa Fe there   s those who do realism, and people really love  what they do because they do a good job. Then there   s more  12  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  contemporary, sometimes abstract, work coming out of Santa Fe now, so  it fits a whole broad category.  When you got into politics, what were the advantages or disadvantages  of coming in as an artist?  Oh, the ability to imagine, to develop concepts and to work through  them. In creating a piece of legislation, for instance, I promoted to start  the alternative education programs in Oklahoma. The reason is that I fit  every category of a school dropout. I figured if I can make it, we need to  help these kids to make it. They   re not dumb. They just learn different.  That   s what I learned about that whole process.  My next job was to get these legislation passed and start putting large  amounts of monies into that program throughout the state. Now it   s kind  of like a regular program in the state of Oklahoma. Understanding this  about public service: When I did that, I understood at that time that those  students, thousands and thousands of students, will never know my  name, will never know my face, but the fact that I helped is important to  me. That   s probably from my ministerial perspective and background.  For me, public service, elected office was my ministry. That   s how I  looked at it.  That   s such an important program. When you first began to get into  prints, you mentioned that Blackbear Bosin and Woody Crumbo were  instrumental in guiding you. What, first of all, made you decide it   s time  to start doing prints?  Well, I had an office in Oklahoma City  and  ran a company out of  Philadelphia in business development. We did business packaging and  finance and feasibility studies, etcetera, etcetera, so I began to get hold  of an idea that I wanted to go into business for myself. I always did want  to, so that wasn   t a big surprise, but I needed a business plan. It took me  two years to develop a business plan that I was comfortable with, that I  could make a decent living for my family, number one. Being an artist  was hard to do, and it   s hard today to do. I may be a better businessman  than I am an artist, quite frankly. I just put a lot of time and effort into  marketing and sales.  Having said that, that   s kind of where I went with it. I took my  experience and background as a developer and applied it to the  development of an art business. It   d have to be an art gallery, and I   m  looking for many concepts to help me through this process and how to  maximize my income and so forth. Ran into Woody Crumbo. I have to  tell you, I thought he was deceased. (Laughter) He walked into my  office one day and knocked on the door and said,    I   m Woody Crumbo.     13  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  I said,    You can   t be. You   re dead.    (Laughter) We became great friends  afterwards.  His art was the first piece of Indian art that I   d ever seen. It was at my  aunt   s house. I was just a young, young boy. It was one of those little  spirit horses, they called them. It was pinned onto the wall. That was the  first one, so it went back a long way. I   d seen his works in books and so  forth. We became great friends, but he said something to me that was  important at that point in terms of my development of a business  concept. He said,    Kelly, I can have three to five art shows on a  weekend.       Oh, yes?    He says,    Yes, I sell prints.    You just send prints  to different places, and at the time you didn   t have to be there. Today,  they want you to be there, so I don   t do that much anymore, but that  sounded right. I was able to do three shows on a weekend across the  country.  He was a good businessman, too, wasn   t he? (Laughs)  He was a good businessman. He understood that concept. He was really  important to me in the development of that concept of the prints. That   s  really where it came from. The other one who also was important was  Blackbear Bosin. Blackbear Bosin had both a prints business, but he also  had a gallery.  Was it in Tulsa?  It was in Wichita. I would go up to his gallery to look at it and visit with  him about how to run an art gallery and the business part of a gallery. So  really it was me putting that gallery concept together with Woody  Crumbo   s concept of prints, merging them together and making a  program. I was very successful at it in the early years. I had sometimes  as much as a hundred galleries ordering prints from me from all over the  world.  I eventually got out of it. I don   t know why, but when I did get into the  legislature in 1980, I remember losing a hundred thousand dollars of  income my first year. Every year, I continued to lose, but I would never  trade my experience in the legislature for anything. It was a great  experience. It was one of the things that I liked to do, and that   s to help  people. I had great love for that. It did take a toll on my income, and it  did for a long, long time. I   m just now able to make a decent living.  (Laughter)  You had this amazing career in the legislature. You even had a run for  governor, which was real exciting, the first Native candidate running for  governor. What was the learning experience in that?  14  Haney  Well, first of all, I   m glad I did it. I   m the only full-blood Indian that   s  ever served in the legislature. I rose to be the chairman of the most  powerful committee in state government. I served on the Executive  Council for the National Council of State Legislators. I was only the  second Oklahoman to ever do that.  Had a lot of good experiences as an Indian person. After twenty-two  years in the legislature, much of that in appropriations, the head of it, I  walked away with my integrity intact. That was really important to me  because had I been doing it for myself, perhaps I might have done some  of those goofy things people do. I was also the image of a nation, of an  Indian nation. In my mind, I had to keep myself above board at  everything I did because I didn   t want to embarrass our people because  if I did, then we   d be shoved back a little bit. So I was able to do that,  and I think I accomplished that.  Quite frankly, I just got tired of being in the legislature at that position  that I was in. That   s a powerful position. I   d done it for years and years.  By this time, I knew what was going to happen every year, got to work  through unique problems every year. I loved it, but I thought it was time  to move on. In my opinion, I was probably, and still believe, that I was  the best qualified candidate for governor at the time. Had more  experience than all of the candidates put together. Understood budgets  better than any candidate that was running because I had been the head  of it. I helped create the school finance act that funds schools throughout  the state of Oklahoma. I   d done all of these things, and I just thought it  was time.  But there   s something else that I   m a little cautious about how I say it.  There is still that issue of Indianness. In Oklahoma, there is still that  issue of color. I don   t care what they say. There still is because I faced it  when I was in legislature. When I go somewhere wearing jeans, I   m  treated    like an Indian.    If I have my suit on, they think I might be  somebody. I know that exists in Oklahoma today.  One of my early experiences of being very, very young, in the  courthouse in Wewoka and seeing the signs going over to restroom. One  said    whites only,    and the other says    coloreds only.    I wasn   t white,  and I wasn   t colored like they   re talking about. I don   t remember what I  did. I   ve gone through that experience. I   ve gone through the experience  of different states refusing to let me into motels, refusing to let me into  restaurants. The irony of it all is I had a military uniform on.  You never forget those, and I   m glad I went through that experience  because it taught me and showed me what other people of color have  15  Little Thunder  Haney  gone through and continue to go through. That really gave me a greater  insight. Probably helped me more in later years, in retrospect, than I  knew, so that was important.  Even today, society, while it   s not as open as it is to most people of  color, there still is that underlying feeling toward Native people and  people of color. I   ll be quick to say it goes the other way, too. Native  people can have damaging thoughts about other people, really for no  reason, people who did nothing to them, so this is kind of a human  behavior and thought process. Somehow, we   ve got to get past it. That   s  one of the things I do when I work around the world. It helps me to  bridge that gap a little bit. (Laughter)  Towards the end of your service in the legislature, you did a sculpture  for the Capitol dome.  Yes, Governor  Frank  Keating had taken the initiative to build a dome  under great duress and conflict, but I   m glad he did. It now looks like a  capitol. I mean, it   s a great building. In fact, I will say to him,    Governor  Keating, I appreciate your building that  25 million pedestal for my  sculpture.    (Laughter)  It was at that time when we were getting ready to build the dome. In the  original design of the dome, there is a sculpture that was designed for it.  The art committees got together, and they started thinking about the kind  of art they would like to have on top. Much more goes into decision  making than most people know. They were building the Land Run  sculptures in downtown Bricktown, Oklahoma City. The concept,    Well,  we   ll need something to balance it. We need an Indian. Allan Houser   s  sculpture is in the front, but it   s a woman, so we need to have an Indian  man.    That   s how it all started. They wanted something    generic.     (Laughter)  That kind of threw me a little bit, but I think ultimately they were  correct. Because of the thirty-nine federally-recognized tribes in  Oklahoma, you can   t just have one up there, so I   ll give it that. There  were over twenty artists who submitted portfolios. I was one of six. We  were given thirty days to come out with a model. The day before I left  for Paris is when I got my notice that I was one of those selected.  We have some offices in Europe that I kind of kept watch over. I went  there, went to Belgium, went on to Taiwan and Japan, and when I got  home, I had two weeks left. I   m thinking,    Oh, I   ll never get this done   I   ll never get this done.    I almost didn   t submit anything, but my mind  keeps turning and working. First thing I do is look for a composition. It   s  not the drawing. It   s the composition. That   s the way it worked, and that  16  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  pretty much established what they wanted.  I was driving from Seminole to the Capitol, going by Tinker Air Force  Base, and this thought came into my mind. It was just like a (snaps). I  reached over and got an envelope and a little pen, and it took less than  five seconds. I just sketched what I wanted so I don   t lose the concept.  After that, two weeks later, I had a sculpture ready for them.  Before that time, I did submit a letter to the Ethics Committee to see  whether or not I could even compete in that competition. The letter they  sent back to me basically said that since the funds were private funds, I  could, so I felt good about that. The second thing I   m happy about is that  the six artists, with our art, we had to take our names off the clay or the  wax piece so no one knew exactly who did what. It   s called a blind  competition. That   s where I won the competition. It was unanimous. I  was real pleased with that.  I eventually, though, gifted them my work at no cost. I just felt like it  was an honor to do it on behalf of me and my family. As you know, in  our Indian way, it   s a great honor just to give, and I thought,    Well,  there   s no greater honor than this one. We   ll just give it to the State of  Oklahoma.    Of course, my brother would always say to me was,    Well,  you shouldn   t give away my share     (Laughter) But that   s how it came  to be. I did a sculpture about nineteen, twenty inches tall in clay, and we  converted it into twenty-two  feet  for the sculpture.  Yes, that   s a huge undertaking. How did     Well, I don   t have to know everything, see. (Laughter). In almost any  profession you   re in, it could be in production, you still need other  people   s help. I don   t assume in the kind of work that I do today that I  have to do all that. I never believed I needed to stretch canvas to be a  good artist. Some people thought you did. Some people thought you  ought to make your own paint. I   m thinking,    I don   t see anything  creative about either one of those.    (Laughter) The foundry does what it  does. I do what I do, and it   s just a complement of the two. My job is to  make sure they do it right, and I keep on top of that.  So you did come in a couple of times during the process?  I do. In the process, I   ll come in to clean it up, make sure all the lines are  clean, and it   s to my standards. That   s what I do.  I think you also donated a sculpture to Seminole College, or was that  one that they purchased?  17  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  Let   s see. I think they purchased that one. It   s a replica of The Guardian.  After The Guardian, I made seven replicas. I have one left, and I think  it   s going to go to the new Army Reserve building in Broken Arrow. I   m  looking forward to that.  You did a bronze sculpture. You had a commission from Chickasaw  Nation?  I did. They wanted one of a Chickasaw warrior, and I did a lot of  research. One of my paintings that I did eventually became a sculpture. I  researched over twenty years, and when I was ready, I was going to get  it. That one took a lot of concentrated, focused research because I was  trying to capture a Chickasaw warrior prior to the coming of the  European. So, going back in research, looking up old lithographs, and  reading to see what the clothing was like, that was really important to  me. I want to get back to that, about how I started research at a very  young age. It   s important for who I am.  That   s what I did. There are some unique things about that sculpture that  I really like. One is they wore long earrings, kind of different than I   d  ever seen. Looked like a golf tee coming through the ear on both sides,  the men did. I thought that   s unique to them, and their heritage was  unique. One of the things I put on the sculpture was the shield. They  made shields like most tribes, using leather and so forth, but they also  used alligator hide. You can understand it   s hard. There   s no arrow  going to come through that.  The other one they used was tree barks. Didn   t think about that. If you  shoot a bow, it   s not going to go very far into the wood. It just does that  and, boing  So Chickasaw Warrior, the shield is made out of wood bark,  so to speak. It was fun doing all that research and seeing what they did at  that time, to do what they did.  You   ve done combinations of Plains images and also Seminole and  Creek images, as well. Research is important to you.  Really important to me. Let me explain about the research. I was in the  tenth grade, and my English teacher knew that I read my books. When  they gave oral reports, I   d get up, and I   d have a great time. I could tell  stories  like  my father  and  my grandfather, so I told stories about the  books, and they loved it. But when it came time to write, she knew I had  great difficulty in writing. She came to me and said,    Enoch, I know  you   re reading your book. I want you to do me three drawings for every  book you read.    That was a challenge.    Wow     I thought,    This will be  easy.     18  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  Well, it wasn   t, because in order to do the Ides of March, I had to study  clothing, architecture, topography. I had to study several books to get  that one drawing. That   s the same process that I use today. I go through  and spend a lot of time researching to make sure that, to the best of my  ability, I have it correct. That   s what I do.  I did one of a Sioux warrior once. It   s called I Will Choose My Time. I  didn   t do it for anyone. It was for myself. When I finally finished  months later, the first thing I did, I had my salesperson take it up north,  one of the Dakotas, for an art show. When they got there, the old men  looked at it and they thought a Sioux must have painted that because  they said everything was right. The colors were right and so forth, so on.  That really made me happy, more than a judge or award could ever do,  even a sale, just to know that they felt like I had done something that  was correct. So that was important.  Research is important to me. Research started with my English teacher  understanding that I had a special need, that I could finish the work but I  had to do it differently. Years later, I was on, I think it was the Johnny  Carson Show or something like that. We were talking about art in my  earlier days of painting, and by this time, she had moved to another  state. Virginia, her name was Virginia, Virginia Brown. She called me to  let me know that she   d saw that show.    I probably wouldn   t have been  there if it wasn   t for you.     Even though you got tired of state politics, you were a tribal councilman  for Seminole Nation, and then you ran for Chief. How did that enrich  your art experience?  Oh, everything I do affects my art experience because basically, almost  any one of my works that you see, with the exception of something like  Chickasaw Warrior, which is just capturing a time and period of history,  all the works that I do primarily have one message. Once you get past all  the flowery words and art critics, it   s usually one message, very simple.  That   s what I do. The Chickasaw Warrior was kind of an exception, but  the rest of the time it   s pretty straight forward. If you just look for a  central message, you get to know  my  art.  It was an opportunity, of course, to do some things in your tribe.  Truthfully, I didn   t want to do it. It wasn   t what I wanted to do. At that  time, the tribe was going through some very difficult times politically,  organizational-wise, bad press almost daily coming out of there. What  really finally got to me was a lot of the young Seminoles. Seminoles in  general said,    I   m ashamed to be Seminole    because of the behavior of  some, not all, but some of the council people. There was friction  19  between the Chief and so forth. No one could help them because the  problem was that they had no court of jurisdiction that they could go to  to solve their problem. Everything was done internal. The CFR  Courts  of Federal Regulations  court, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, they  couldn   t interfere, couldn   t go to federal court, couldn   t give it to state  court.  The only court they had was the Council. The council of anybody, a  legislative body, is a political body. You line up on sides, and whoever   s  got the most on their side gets to win. It has nothing to do with justice.  It   s no different. The state legislature tried to make a decision by saying,     It   s too political,    and that   s what it was. They couldn   t get past that.  I took a long time to think about it. I prayed about it for months, I mean,  seriously, just thinking,    Gee, I don   t want to do this, God.    I meant to  get out of politics, but eventually I guess I convinced myself that I was  the only one that had the experience to pull them out of this problem. So  we did. I won pretty easy. I had five opponents, I think four or five  opponents, and I won with 65 percent of the vote. That comes with  experience, though. I campaigned so many years, I knew how to do this.  So I did that.  There were several problems. One, when I walked into office, they  didn   t have any credit. Most of the people they did business with were  friends of mine that I had helped when I was state senator. They said,     Senator, I will help you,    so we got it going again. Then I went through  the books, and I found they had money to pay. They just weren   t paying.  I have no idea why. I said,    You   re going to pay your bills. Everybody  pays their bills.    That   s one of the things I had to go through for a long  time, trying to get that straight.  The second thing is how you look at yourself is important. Where the  tribe should be, I looked at it as a profession, something honorable to do,  just like if you   re working for the state or federal government, how you  dress, how you behave, how you talk. The first day I show up there,  there   s a young man. He   s got jeans on and writings all over his old t-shirt,  smoking. Well, I hired a gentleman that was a great friend of mine  who was head of personnel for the Army for a long time, Colonel Leon  Lusty. I said,    Colonel, we need to get this together.    So the first day, he  went up and got the staff together.    I see you come in jeans and a t-shirt  tomorrow, don   t come because you   re out of a job.    Second day, I came  to work, and he   s sitting at the door. He looked up at me and says,     Chief, you   re seven minutes late.       Okay, won   t do that again,  Colonel.    (Laughter) It took that to say,    You   re professionals. Dress  like a professional. Behave like a professional.     20  Little Thunder  Haney  The complaint was that they were abusive on the phone. We had to  correct that. State employees have been bad about that. I   m aware of  that. It   s just not an Indian problem. It   s working with people and  making them feel good about their job and let them know what their job  is. Of course, we ended up with a pretty professional staff. I always wore  a suit because I was taught to wear a suit in the legislature. As soon as  I   d leave, I   d put my jeans back on. While I   m working, I   m  representing the tribe.  One of the more serious problems, the one thing I wanted to do if  nothing else besides getting the finances together was to create a tribal  court. For the lifetime of the Seminole tribe, they have not had a tribal  court. The Chickasaws, Choctaws, Cherokees, Creeks, they   ve all had  tribal courts from the beginning of the last century. We have not. It   s  always been that Council.  It was a battle to get it passed because they had to spend a lot of money  and time and effort to get out there and convince people it   s the right  thing to do. There were those who didn   t want to change and who was  fighting against it, but we changed it. I think of all the things I did for  the tribe, that was probably the biggest single thing I did for them that  could help them to become a government and to be a responsible  government.  They had that, but we did other things. I set up a land fund to purchase  lands for the Seminole. We have very small land, and I   m pretty good at  selecting real estate properties. We went and bought properties in and  around Seminole. Bought a little office plaza. Whenever I had monies  coming in for a grant, I said,    We   re not going to lease. We   ll go buy it,  and we   ll rent from ourselves,    and that   s what I did. We always found  good properties, so we expanded the land base for the Seminoles, as  well, while we were doing that.  The one that I worked on when I was at the state level, among other  things, is the one for domestic violence. Established and purchased land  out of the area, got them a nice little place and funded a domestic  violence program with a home. To my knowledge, that   s underway right  now. So there were several things we did that I think made a difference,  but I was so tired. (Laughter) I really was.  Ready to get back to your art. (Laughter) You   ve done a lot of exhibiting  overseas. Your showing overseas goes back many years.  The first art show I had in another country was in Vienna, Austria. I was  just a young kid, didn   t know what I was doing.  21  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  Your first time?  Yes, had a show there. I think I was the only Native there, but they had a  reception for us at a palace. The heads of states and the royalty from that  part of the world, prince, princesses, dukes, they were there. That was  the first in my life, the only time in my life I   ve been uncomfortable  because for a little old Seminole boy from Seminole, Oklahoma, that   s  pretty powerful. You only read about this in books.  What I remember about that experience is not the art and so forth. This  young lady, beautiful young lady, was a princess somebody. Emerald  green dress on, jewels knocked your eyes out, and she said,    Mr. Haney,  where are you from?    Knowing that she didn   t know where Oklahoma  was, probably, I said,    Well, I   m from a place called Turkey Creek,  Oklahoma. Its ten miles north of a place called Seminole, Oklahoma,  and Seminole   s in Oklahoma, which is in the middle of the country.     What that did, it affirmed to me who I am. It says,    Yes, I   m from  somewhere, and that   s where I   m from.    It   s important for me, not just  geographically where I   m at but, ultimately, I come from an Indian  family and Indian culture in this area, right here. So, for me, that really  confirmed who you are. Know who you are. It   s important for me.  What was one of the most exciting shows you had overseas?  Oh, I think probably the one I did that was financially successful, at  least, was in Singapore. They had arranged to have a big show there, and  a holding company was sponsoring me. They owned the newspaper,  television, magazine, everything in Singapore. They asked if I would  come over, and I did, had an art show.  Weeks before I arrived, I sent them all kinds of photos. They were  asking about my picture, photos of my artwork, and they started putting  those on everything, the whole system. By the time I get to Singapore,  I   m walking down streets and in buildings, and people would say,    Oh,  you   re the red Indian.    That   s what they referred to us as: red Indians.     Uh, yes?    (Laughter) But that was a highly successful show, and it was  one of my entries into other cultures. Since that time, in the legislature I  have had the opportunity to establish commerce offices in Singapore and  work with people there to have a better understanding. That was great.  That was one of my better ones.  You   ve been to China quite a bit.  I have. Thirty years. I   m not exactly sure what started   I do. The first  trip I made (I don   t know what year it was) was on behalf of David  22  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  Boren at OU to go explore the possibilities of getting students to OU.  That was my assignment, and so I went. The fact that I was a senator  elevated me to the status of politician, so it was the government of China  who took care of me and made sure everything went right and so forth  and so on. That was a good experience. From then, I   ve been there many  times. More recently, it   s a different purpose.  I have a new business. I   m seventy-one, but I have to find something to  do. I have a partner. He and I have a business development company,  and what we do, we find Oklahoma companies, or even across the  country, who want financing for large projects. In fact, we have many  investors in China today that go all around the world and buy properties.  Real estate, oil and gas, mining, you name it, wherever they can make  money, they   re out there.  I have a real connection with Chinese people. I just have this ability to  work and understand and get to know people, and so I   ve got some good  contacts there. I have some clients who are looking at some business  possibilities. I will say this. I don   t take anything less than  50 million  projects because it   s not worth my time. I   m retired. If I   m going to  work, I need to make a little something out of it, you know, so that   s  what I do.  Do you feel a connection with the Chinese art, too?  Not necessarily. I collect Chinese art and every time I go to China, they  always introduce me to the top artists in China, which is always fun. I   ve  gotten work from them, and usually they give me something. I   ll sit  down at their studio and do a little painting for them or something. It   s  fun.  In terms of your media and techniques, starting with painting, has  acrylic pretty much been your preferred medium?  It is. It may not even be my preferred, aesthetically. It   s preferred  because oil painting takes so long to dry. I   ve had the experience of  starting an oil painting with this emotional feel for it. It took so long, by  the time I got to the other end, it wasn   t that same feel.  With acrylic, it   s almost as fast as watercolors. Once I start with acrylic,  I almost go through it, just one sweep. You can maintain that momentum  that you have, whatever those emotions are, that creativity, whatever you  want to call it, is just going through there and kind of moves like this.  The other one is slow. I wish it was a faster medium. I   d probably use  oils.  23  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  You   ve done quite a few monoprints, I guess?  I   ve done monoprints, lithographs, whatever, as time permits. I wish I  had more time to do it. As you   ve already pointed out, I have business  interests. I have political involvement. I taught a couple of years at OCU  in the area of business and marketing. I was on their board for a decade.  I   m still active, not today. I   m off of most things, but the Cultural Center  in Oklahoma City was my creation in the beginning, and so I serve on  that board. That   s probably the only one I do. I have been invited to be  on the board for the Creativity Conference of Asian countries.  (Laughter)  Wow  That might be kind of fun.  Well, I   ve given it some thought.  How do you think your painting style has changed over the years?  Just evolution. I think as your life changes, the way you look at life, it  just changes with that. I   m always moving toward something that   s  comfortable for me. The only hard thing for me to do in art, and I   ve had  three classes, is pottery. I cannot do pottery. (Laughter) I just give up on  that, but the rest of it I seem to be able to do marginally well at it.  You have to understand about my life is that I   ve probably spent 10  percent of my life, if that much, doing art. If I could do 20 percent, at  least logic tells me I could do twice as good, but I   ll never be there. It   s a  combination of art good enough and exceptional marketing ability.  Unfortunately, a lot of artists don   t have that, the second part. Great  artists can starve to death.  I know you use live models in your paintings, and often family members.  Why is it important to have a live model?  There   s something about using a model that gives depth to what you   re  doing. I use a lot of photos, but then there is that flatness. If you look at  something in three-dimensional, particularly with some of the kind of  work I do, it gives it volume, gives it perspective that you miss if it   s just  a two-dimensional image that you   re looking at.  Of course, when you   re working in sculpture, you   re doing that three-dimensional  thing. You work realistically. Is there any carryover from  painting to sculpture at all?  Only in that I try to make sure my anatomy and things are correct. I   m  sure it works differently with other people. For me, sculpting is a better  24  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  medium now. Having said that, the school I went to in Philadelphia,  much of it focused on planning, so when I was twenty-nine years old, I  planned the rest of my life out.  At thirty-five, I was going to be in tribal government. I was. At forty, I  was going to be in state politics. I was. I planned to be there ten years,  go get my doctorate, teach at a university, and come back. Except when  I got my ten years in the legislature, I   m pretty powerful, (Laughter) able  to do many, many good things for people. I really enjoyed it, so I stayed.  I never did go get my doctorate, but I have taught at the university. I  guess that counts for something. The bottom line to all that is I decided  when I was fifty-five I was going to start sculpting. I missed it by one  year. I was fifty-six.  That   s when you produced your first series that you commercially  marketed?  When I first did any of the large monumental stuff. I had done some  along the way. I guess that   s one way of saying I didn   t paint anymore. I  don   t paint today. Just doing sculpting now because at my age you can  only do so much with your life. I have to plan my life and time out.  Time management is the biggest thing in my life. It   s making sure that  I   m able to accomplish some measure of success. As a general rule, on a  daily basis I make a list of things I have to do. Sometimes I have as  many as fifty things. Once I get them written down, I don   t have to think  about,    I need to do it.    I look at my list, and I categorize them by  importance, and I just start doing them without thinking. At the end of  the time, at least at the end of the day, I know I did something.  And it   s not just sculpture. It   s pretty monumental sculpture, for the most  part.  It is. It is.  You enjoy working in that scale?  I do because for me, for the art part, it makes me feel like I did  accomplish something in my art, not as much as I could have, but  perhaps life wasn   t intended to be that way for me because I was  involved in so many other things. I   ve had a blessed life. It   s not always  been rosy. It   s kind of like running for governor. I   m glad I did, didn   t  like to get beat, but somebody had to win, and somebody had to lose. I  don   t always win. That   s what people have to understand.  While I   ve been successful in many things, there   s been times I just fell  flat on my face. Being who I am and what I believe as a Native person, I  25  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  get back up, dust myself off, and maybe have to go a different direction,  but I   ll get up and keep going. I   ve started over I don   t know how many  times. (Laughter)  I think you   ve hinted at what your creative process is from the time you  get an idea, but can you take us through that?  Not real complicated, for one. Don   t make it any more complicated than  it is. For me, I have the complication of getting it done. As far as the  process is concerned, once the image is in my mind and a composition  has been formed, then I start piecing it together. For instance, I   m doing  this horse and rider. Well, I   ve got to do the horse. I   ve got the horse. I  spend a great deal of time studying anatomy, muscle structure, and I go  see the horse all the time.  Is it a horse that you have here on the property?  That   s taken me awhile. I should finish that, I think, in ten to fifteen  days. A rider goes on top of it, but that should be done within the same  period. In thirty days I should have that ready. It will be enlarged to  twelve feet tall. Once I get that part done, it goes to a company here in  Norman, a digital company. They take an image of that sculpture, and  they can make it any size I want. It comes back to me in Styrofoam,  identical to the image they took. The foundry will build a quarter-inch of  clay around it. While it   s standing   like The Guardian, it was huge. It  looked very heavy, but the fact is, it   s cut into many pieces, and I can  move them around because it   s Styrofoam.  Once you   ve got it enlarged and you   ve got everything in place and it  looks right, then they start chopping it up. The Guardian is made into  fifty different pieces. That   s for the purpose of being able to fit it into  one of the vats that they have for the process. Once they do that and they  cast it, then they weld it back together. Then it   s a very crude looking  bronze image, but that   s when you put the patina on, which is a color  glaze. Once they put the coloring, it looks like one piece. That   s a simple  way of putting it, but that   s basically what happens. I usually stay along  with the whole process, kind of keep an eye on it.  Looking back on your career, what do you think was kind of a fork-in-the-  road moment when you could have gone one direction but you went  a different one?  Can   t say. I guess I   ve kind of done what I wanted to do along the way.  There was no timing. It was just when the time was right to do  something, I did it. I don   t know what that fork in the road was.  26  Little Thunder  Haney  Now, there was one fork in the road that   it does affect my life. You  know, smoking cigarettes was a cultural thing with our Native people.  We used tobacco all the time. My dad gave me permission to smoke  when I was fourteen, so by the time I was like twenty or something, I  was smoking two packs a day. Just back from the military and going to  Bacone, and had a lot of beer in my room, and smoking a lot and playing  a lot of cards. (Laughter)  One day, I was standing out on the campus of the college, and I looked,  and my hands were just shaking like this. I thought,    Oh, God, I can   t be  an artist like this. I want to make something of myself. I can   t be doing  this.    At that time and at that moment, I quit smoking and I quit  drinking. There was no tapering off, no tapes or nothing. I just decided,     I   m not doing this no more,    and I quit. I   m not even sure I thought  about it too much. I just decided to quit. To me, that was   I guess it was  some sort of miracle. Some people have such a hard time. I smoked a  lot. Think two packs a day. That   s a lot. That was a turning point right  there. (Laughs)  What has been one of the low points of your career, do you think?  Oh, talking about life and career like this, it   s when I lost my son. He  was eighteen. The day before graduation, he got killed in a car wreck.  That was devastating. I mean, I look back on that experience then, and  that was the worst experience I   ve ever had in my life. Continues to be. I  hope I never lose another child. I want to be gone before that happens.  When that happened, I was three weeks away from deciding if I would  run for another term in the legislature. Out of self-preservation I decided  to run to keep busy, and that   s what I did. I just kept busy. Get up at six-thirty  every morning. My friend picked me up and  would  bring me  home at night every night. We campaigned the whole time. We had a lot  of fun doing that, just me and my best friend. That was kind of what we  did. That was probably a low point.  What happened is in oils I created a painting called Emptiness Has a  Claim on Death. It was a powerful painting. Probably speaks more than  anything I   ve ever done. It catches me personally, my emotion. It   s a  painting of a Seminole man, traditional clothing, evening. From here to  here, it   s transparent so you can see through the body because that   s how  you feel when you lose somebody that   s so close to you. You feel  emptiness.  At the same time, it   s like the hole inside is concrete. It   s a strange  feeling, that emptiness. That   s why I called it Emptiness Has a Claim on  Death. That helped me to   that was my therapy to deal with that issue.  27  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  That   s when I also settled in. I   m painting my emotions in about  everything I do. Not all, but most of what I do is really coming from that  artist spirit, whatever that is, that comes out of an artist that really has  something to say.  I might only do two to five things a year that really makes an impact. I  may do several. I   m just trying to look around, but there   s something  will come through. Usually, it comes through when I   m doing a piece of  work that I   m doing for myself.  You have that freedom.  I have that freedom. I don   t have to worry,    Will they like this? I wonder  if they like this color versus this color?    I don   t have to do that. Then,  one of the things that came out, and life can change, anyway, in a lot of  perspectives, but my son was married. He was in high school, and he  was married. He had a job, took care of his family. He had a son that  was born a month after his death. Today, his son is twenty-seven,  twenty-eight, and he   s vice president of a bank. See? (Laughter)  He called the other day. Well, it   s an extension of him. It   s just like his  arm. He   s still with me in that way. Not everybody has the luxury of  saying that, but my grandson is like my son   s arm. That   s him. That   s  his arm. I just have been really blessed with children who are talented  and hardworking and brilliant and all those things that I   m not.  (Laughter)  I don   t know about that. (Laughs) Well, is there anything that we didn   t  talk about that you   d like to cover or you want to add before we look at  your artwork?  Oh, probably not. There   s a jillion things we could talk about, but I think  we   ve done quite a bit.  Well, let   s take a look at some of this work, then. Would you like to tell  us a little bit about this piece?  One night I was painting late, as I normally did, three or four o   clock in  the morning. I was painting a small owl for a painting, and because of  the condition of my eye at the time, my focus, I thought I saw some  movement inside the feather. I stopped, and I thought,    Wow, if I could  just intentionally do that.     So I put that painting down and pulled this one out, just white canvas,  and put a big owl on it. I started putting images inside the owl, using  texture of the feathers, even in the eye. Once I did that, when I got  28  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  through, I had my own style, so to speak. That   s been a pretty popular  concept. People have enjoyed that. It   s almost like a conversation piece.  I don   t know how much art it is, but people like to talk about it and show  it to their peers. I know people think when I paint that I do that with all  my paintings. I do not.  How about this painting?  It   s called Kelli Brooke. Kelli Brooke is my daughter. She lives in  Norman. She   s a musician. She   s a professional photographer. She does  some film making. She was a very young girl at the time we did this in  Seminole. She had her Seminole dress on, and the flowers around are the  Indian Blanket. The Indian Blanket is the legislation that I passed.  Sometimes I do fun things in legislation, and that was one of the fun  things. It was for something very specific. I wanted to do a collector  plate, and I thought this would work out, so that   s why I painted it. It  was my painting, so to speak, and I   ve not been willing to let this one  go. (Laughs)  Got to hold on to some.  This painting is called The Lighthorsemen. At least to the Five Civilized  Tribes who had organized law enforcement as part of their system of  justice and judicial program of the different tribal governments, The  Lighthorsemen in this time were looked upon like the Texas Rangers or  the Mounted Police of Canada. Their reputation was respected. They  were feared. In fact, one of the records stated by one of the criminals  during that period of time said one of the things he didn   t want is    those  Light Horsemen coming after us because they   ll track us, they   ll get us,  and they   ll kill us.    (Laughter)  The Lighthorsemen had that kind of authority. I   m currently writing a  book with my son, a story about the Lighthorsemen, starting in Florida  and going through the Civil War period and into reconstruction and  finally to statehood. That   s coming along pretty well.  That   s great. Okay, this is one of your sculptures. What is this piece  called?  It   s called Standing His Ground. It   s a story that was told to me by Doc  Tate Nevaquaya, some thirty-some-odd years ago, and it kind of stayed  with me. When the time came, I visited with him and Woogie  Watchetaker, who were great friends of mine, to show me exactly the  clothing of the Comanches. I studied the clothing and went through  books and artifacts, visited with them. I did two large paintings before  they finally said,    Okay. It   s okay, now.    I tried to make it as authentic  29  Little Thunder  Haney  Little Thunder  Haney  as possible, and that includes a lot of research.  This is one of those stories, too, where it   s a dramatic image, but it has  one message. It   s called Standing His Ground for a reason. When faced  with insurmountable odds, the warrior would tie himself to the ground  and would go no further. That   s his statement to oncoming warriors that,     I   m not moving anymore. This is as far as I   m going. Let   s just do what  we   ve got to do.     That   s a statement of standing up for what you believe. A family,  teacher, businessman, father, mother, a child, we all get to that point  where we say,    No more,    and we stand our ground. This is more human  condition than it is that one warrior.  Right. Would you like to tell us about this  sculpture ?  This is the maquette for the twenty-two-foot bronze sculpture that   s on  top of the State Capitol. It   s about twenty inches, the original, so it was  enlarged considerably to do the larger. It   s an image of a Native person  prior to the coming of the Europeans. To the best of my ability, I used all  Native, natural materials for clothing and beads and other things so that  it would not represent any particular tribe but represent all tribes.  The one feature about it that I like is (unbeknownst to the people who I  created it for, who thought Standing His Ground was too  confrontational) I went ahead and put the lance through the bottom of  his leggings to tie him to the ground because that   s what I believe about  Oklahoma. Oklahoma is the kind of people that really stand their  ground. Particularly at the State Capitol, it   s designed to make a  statement about the legislature and the people who are in power, that  their responsibilities in the legislative bodies and judicial bodies and so  forth is to take care of the legal rights of the people in the state of  Oklahoma.  Can you tell us about this one?  This is called Circle of Life. It was a commissioned piece by the  Oklahoma Banking Commission which is at Twenty-Eighth Street and  North Lincoln Boulevard, just two blocks north of the State Capitol. The  original size is five feet tall. This is a replica, the maquette. It   s twenty-one  inches tall. It   s a combination of bronze and stainless steel. The  design is the use of what I call negative space design so that certain parts  of the body is missing, but it still is designed so that it looks like the  whole. So that   s basically what it is.  There are several theological, philosophical concepts about the Circle.  30  Little Thunder  Haney  Most Native people use the Circle as that one event that ties all of our  people together to some degree. It represents the four seasons. It  represents the beginning of life to death and the recycling of life, as it  were. It also represents that all people, no matter where they live and  who they are, whatever their situation is, are of equal value on that  Circle, and that  the  Creator places equal value on all people throughout  the world.  That   s wonderful. Thank you so much for your time, Kelly.  It   s okay. Had to do something. (Laughter)  -------  -------
