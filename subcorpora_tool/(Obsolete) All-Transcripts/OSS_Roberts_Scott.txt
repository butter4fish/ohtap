 Milligan with the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Today   s date is March 10, 2016. I   m in Pryor, Oklahoma, today talking to Scott Roberts about his time at OSU and sort of his career following that. This is part of the Cowboys in Every County project with the O-STATE Stories collection. Now everyone knows how to tag that.  Roberts Okay.  Milligan Okay, so easy stuff. Just tell me a little bit, and you can look at me, just tell me a little bit about yourself. Who your parents are, where you   re from, where you grew up, all that good stuff.  Roberts Okay. I   m Scott Roberts. I grew up in Piedmont, Oklahoma. My mom and dad were Herb and Carol Roberts. I graduated high school in    85, so I was at OSU from    85 to    89.  Milligan Okay. Eighty-five to eighty-nine.  Roberts Yup.  Milligan Tell me a little bit about Piedmont. What kind of town is it, what kind of school did you go to, all that good stuff.  Roberts It   s a suburb of Oklahoma City. It   s now become a larger suburb. When I was there, it was smaller. It was a   I think we were a 3A school, and I graduated with about a hundred people. It   s become much bigger as Oklahoma City has grown, but back then, it was just a kind of a country town.  Milligan That was a small size class, yeah.  Roberts Yeah.  5  Milligan What was the   what was sort of the industry and the recreation in the town? Was it a lot of agriculture? Was it a lot of   more urban     Roberts Yeah.  Milligan    or more suburban?  Roberts A little bit of that, but a lot of agriculture, yes. Piedmont   s not   at that time was not much of a town. It was just a little, tiny town, but it was a big school district. It kind of rubbed up with the edge of Oklahoma City, and then went all the way out to Okarche, Kingfisher area, so kind of covered a big area.  Milligan Pulled a lot in.  Roberts Yeah, and all different types of people. A lot of the, you know, more of the agriculture, country people, that lived there for generations, and then some of the city people moved out to there.  Milligan So, did you do anything with agriculture then if that was more sort of the field?  Roberts I did not.  Milligan You escaped? (Laughs)  Roberts I escaped. Yeah, I was more into athletics and stuff like that.  Milligan Yeah  Did you play sports then?  Roberts Yes. I played football, basketball, and baseball.  Milligan Oh, so all of the triumvirate? (Laughs)  Roberts Yeah, and you know, back then   I mean, and we were small enough that everybody kind of played everything, or at least two of the three sports anyway. So, yeah   .  Milligan It makes sense. You graduated high school in    85. Like how did you end up at OSU? What was the decision for that?  Roberts You know, a friend of mine   most of the people that I knew went to OU, and that   s where I was   I was thinking about going to OU, kind of had looked at small colleges to play sports, but then my first trip was in the spring of my senior year. I went up to OSU and just really liked it, and kind of fell in love with it. That kind of turned me around and went to OSU.  6  Milligan So you just went for a campus visit then?  Roberts It was a rush party.  Milligan Oh, okay  (Laughs)  Roberts Rush party weekend. I started there, and then did the campus visit, I guess.  Milligan Well, so I think that   s interesting because geographically, you were located closer to OU, and if a lot of your classmates were going there that   s sort of your comfort zone     Roberts Right.  Milligan    so how did it   I mean, how did it end up feeling? Like, once you actually decided,    I   m going to break away from all that.     Roberts It felt good, and it just   to me, the whole   I don   t know, just the atmosphere at OSU just seemed like it was kind of my cup of tea a little more, you know, than anywhere else I   d been.  Milligan Uh-huh, so like what were some of the differences? Do you remember?  Roberts I really liked the fact that it   you know, it seemed like it that it was far enough away from Oklahoma City and Tulsa that, you know, on the weekends not everybody just bolted for the   everybody kind of stayed there. It was kind of a   I don   t know, there was a little more, I don   t know, hominess or a hometown feel to it. It seemed like everyone was kind of on an island there a little bit, which I thought was kind of neat.  Milligan Yeah. Well, that   s true. Geographically there   s a little bit of a distance     Roberts Right.  Milligan    to get anywhere urban.  Roberts Yeah.  Milligan What did you end up   did you   well, when you started, did you have a declared major or did you feel stuff out? What was your initial interest?  Roberts I started in the business field, just general, and then I graduated with a marketing degree.  Milligan What led you down those paths?  7  Roberts Well, you know, my family was in the automotive business, so   I mean, it   s a big marketing business. You do quite a bit of that type of stuff, so that   s kind of   I kind of knew that   s probably where I was going to head in the business world, so that   s what led me to marketing.  Milligan Maybe talk a little bit about growing up in a family that was in the automotive industry, because I have no idea what that would be like.  Roberts Right.  Milligan Did you spend a lot of time sort of in the offices, or getting a feel, or just something that     Roberts I started probably thirteen, fourteen years old, washing cars and pretty much   my dad had a Nissan dealership in Oklahoma City. He was actually the first Datsun dealer in the state of Oklahoma, back when there were Datsuns, but yeah, I started out washing cars, worked the parts department, service department. Kind of had sat   before I went to college, I had sat in quite a few seats in the car dealership.  Milligan Did you have any siblings?  Roberts Yes. Yep. (Laughs) I have two older sisters. One of them is the one that went to OU, she was closer in age to me. She went to OU, and I went to OSU.  Milligan A house divided  So     Roberts And I   m married to an OU girl, too.  Milligan    definitely a house divided  Did you   did your sisters spend a lot of time in the dealership as well?  Roberts Uh-huh. Lynn, the one that   s just above me, she spent a lot of time, and ran our accounting department after we graduated or after she graduated, then I graduated. She   s a couple years older than me, so yeah, she spent some time in the automotive business. She   s not in it anymore. She   s a financial planner.  Milligan Oh, well that   s not bad either   Roberts Yeah. (Laughter) So   .  Milligan Well, so whenever you were doing this as a teenager, you said you started at thirteen and sort of kicked around in different areas. How did you learn   I mean, washing cars, I guess, that maybe doesn   t take as much training, but 8  working in sort of the mechanics area, it sounds like and some of that, how did you learn how to do that sort of stuff?  Roberts Well, after I   probably the best training I had was after I graduated from OSU, I went to Dallas and sold cars down there, and did a little bit of finance. Then I went through the NADA Dealer Academy, so the National Auto Dealers Dealer Academy, and that was a real good experience. It   s kind of like a grad school specifically for automotive dealers.  Milligan Okay. That makes sense.  Roberts That was probably my best formalized training as far as specific in the automobile business.  Milligan Yeah. Well, enough to get to where you are, even today     Roberts Yes.  Milligan    but even to find out that was something you thought you might want to pursue. You   d spent enough time, it sounds like, before you went to college to make the decision like,    All right, I can dig this industry.     Roberts Right.  Milligan I wonder, like what   maybe some of the things that helped shape your outlook on that, even as a young person?  Roberts I would say I saw my dad, and I always looked up to him, and he taught me a lot and mentored me. It just seemed like the natural path. By the time I got out of college, I felt like I knew   I kind of had a start in that direction and knew quite a bit about the industry, as opposed to any other industry, and always liked it. I like working with numbers, and so     Milligan That   s a big part.  Roberts    yeah.  Milligan How did your dad get into it?  Roberts My dad, he was a Marine. He was in the Marine Corps, and he was stationed in Japan for a while, and he   at the time, the Datsuns were used as taxi cabs over there. He gets out of the service, and he   s over here. I believe he was flying for American Airlines, and he always loved cars, and he had a couple of friends who had used car lots. Anyway, he bumped into some guys, they pulled up in a Datsun. This was back in 1965,    66. Anyway, they pulled up to this restaurant in a Datsun, and he said,    Hey     Something like,    What are 9  you doing in that goofy looking Datsun?    or something. They were like,    How do you know what this is?    He said,    Well, I just got back from Japan not too long ago.    Anyway they said,    Well actually, we   re here trying to find car dealers to peddle these things.    So that conversation turned into   he called his buddy that was in the car business, and they put a deal together with Datsun at that time, and that   s how he got in the car business.  Milligan That is not what I would expect from   that   s so random  (Laughs)  Roberts Yeah  I mean, just totally   yeah.  Milligan That   s pretty cool. How long did he end up selling Datsuns then? Because, I guess that   s what got him in the door, but   .  Roberts Right, yeah. He started in 1966, and then Datsun turned   they changed the name to Nissan, and he sold his Nissan store in 2000. So he was thirty-four years.  Milligan That   s a long time, after he had served his career in military, in a sense.  Roberts Yeah.  Milligan So he went from being a pilot to selling cars?  Roberts Yep  Being a car dealer, yes. (Laughter)  Milligan That   s pretty cool.  Roberts Yeah  Not what you expected, huh? (Laughter)  Milligan No, no. It   s not. I don   t know what the normal is, but that is not what I would think.  Roberts Right, yeah.  Milligan All right, so whenever you went to OSU, and you lined it up for business; let   s talk a little bit about sort of the business program, maybe, how you felt about that, and what might have been interesting to you at the time, and then we can kind of move to some of the other things on campus and in Stillwater.  Roberts Probably, I remember my adviser was Curtis Hamm. I don   t know if you   ve heard of him, but he was kind of legendary.  Milligan He   s come up in at least one of my interviews so far.  10  Roberts Has he? Well, he really kind of got me headed in the marketing direction. I just really liked him, and had him for a class, and became my adviser, and he probably really is the one that kind of set me down that road while I was there.  Milligan Really? That   s interesting.  Roberts Yeah.  Milligan Like, what were some of the things that he would have said to sort of steer you?  Roberts You know, he was just real   to me, he was kind of real, real world. He was,    Education is important, but you got to be able to socialize. You got to be able to network. A lot of that   s just as important as the As and Bs in school.    That   s what I really liked about him. He was very encouraging,    You can do this     Just always a lot of encouragement from him.  Milligan Focused more on, as much on career as he was the education component or education success?  Roberts Exactly.  Milligan That   s good. What about   were   I guess you were marketing from the start, because you knew what you were going to do.  Roberts Yeah. I think I was business-undecided until about my junior year, and that   s when I   about the time I met up with Dr. Hamm.  Milligan That   s when the switch happened   I got it, okay. What were some of the courses that you think   or how did that shift, once you actually moved into marketing from the general business? Do you remember?  Roberts Not specifically. I know I was looking at accounting and stuff like that. I quickly realized that path wasn   t for me. (Laughter) I definitely didn   t want to be at a desk, behind a desk. I would much rather be out socializing, a little bit more on the move, so I think that   s probably maybe why the marketing. I took a lot of   quite a few management classes as well, so kind of marketing management was kind of what   and I felt like it would probably serve me the best down the road as well.  Milligan Well, it seems like, from the outside at least, the car industry   marketing is a huge part of it, right?  Roberts Yes, it is.  11  Milligan And the communication angle of it     Roberts Yes, it is.  Milligan    I can   t imagine just having an accounting degree, and walking into this and being like,    This makes sense     (Laughs)  Roberts Right  Yeah, a lot of it does not make sense, (laughter) but yeah, somehow it works.  Milligan That   s good. Also, just your time in general at OSU, what were some of the things that you did socially, and what were some hangouts, and all that good stuff?  Roberts I was in Sigma Nu fraternity, and that was a big part of my experience at OSU because I made a lot of lifetime friends there. Real involved in the fraternity. I was rush chairman and some stuff like that, held some offices.  Milligan Oh, yeah  Well, were they the group that you initially got hung up with whenever you went to visit campus in the first place?  Roberts Yes.  Milligan Oh  (Laughs)  Roberts Yes, one of. There was a couple different ones, but yes, one of. Yeah.  Milligan I don   t know, tell me a little bit about what   some of the things that you did while you were with that group.  Roberts Oh, like I say, we probably   I was the rush chairman, and that was a big deal because I did that three years while I was there. They gave you a budget, and you had an apartment in Tulsa or Oklahoma City, and you had to stay within budget. You had to recruit guys, and get so many guys. It was   I thought that was really great preparation for a lot of things, but a lot of pressure to perform there too, so   .  Milligan A lot of recruitment that you had to do?  Roberts Yeah, and a lot of money management because you   re trying to campaign, so to say, and you   re trying to keep it going. Sometimes money got tight, and you had to look for more resources and do some fundraising, and that kind of stuff.  Milligan What about Homecoming? Was Homecoming a big deal?  12  Roberts Yes. That was a big deal. Very big deal. Sounds like it   s gotten even bigger since. Yeah, but that   s   I do remember when I first got to OSU. We   d been there a couple of weeks. It   s the second week of September and they   re like,    Okay, we   ve got to start on the house dec.    I   m like,    Huh? It   s not for another six, eight weeks, whatever.    I didn   t realize before I went up there how much preparation goes into that. Like I say, I think from what I see, it   s more so now than it even was back then.  Milligan It   s pretty big.  Roberts Yeah   Milligan Do you remember some of the things you all did for Homecoming, some of the different displays?  Roberts Oh, gosh  Yeah, I remember. We always had the   they would have the pomping parties, so   . It seemed like there were shifts going, almost seems like they were going twenty-four hours at the end, because we were always   a little procrastination so all the work was getting done at the end. I remember having like a Jupiter Jump bounce house out in the front yard, because they had some kind of a spirit deal that they judged for, I don   t know if they still do that, and you always had to have somebody bouncing, or whatever your theme was. A lot   I remember we had a lot of agricultural guys in our house that did a lot of the welding and that kind of stuff, that some guys like me that could not do, for sure. Yeah, just making real big globes turn, and yeah.  Milligan Yeah, so you had a few key guys who could do some of the engineering part of it, and then the rest of you all would just put the paper in? (Laughter)  Roberts Yeah, exactly, or carry stuff or whatever, yeah.  Milligan That   s pretty interesting. I did   it is, it   s a big event, and I know it   s been a really popular event for a long time. It seems you   re right, seems to be growing.  Roberts Yeah.  Milligan When   s the last time you were back for something to do with Homecoming?  Roberts Oh, mercy  It   s probably been seven or eight years since I   ve been back.  Milligan Oh, yeah?  Roberts Yeah, we live up in Grand Lake and have three, I was going to say small children, but they are getting bigger now. Our oldest is ten, so this last ten 13  years has been   we   re about three hours from Stillwater, two and a half or three hours, so it   s a little bit of a drive over there with little ones. It   s a little tough to pull off, so I haven   t been there as much as I   d like.  Milligan Well, yeah, and there   s really thousands of people in the streets, so     Roberts Right, yeah   Milligan    it makes it harder with small children too.  Roberts Yes, exactly.  Milligan I was just curious about that. You   a lot of your social time, and extracurricular, was put towards sort of helping the fraternity management, it sounds like.  Roberts Uh-huh.  Milligan Were there other things? Were you active in business societies, or groups, or other things that were useful for later?  Roberts None of that stuff. Academically, I probably didn   t qualify. (Laughter) I didn   t qualify for most of it. I was an average student at best, probably.  Milligan That   s fine, (laughter) not that you need my validation  Well, I think that   s part of it. A lot of people come into school, they come through different paths, and then while they   re there, they have different paths, and when they leave, they have different paths.  Roberts Right, right. Well, and that   s   talking about Dr. Hamm, that   s where he was real encouraging to me.    Hey, your grades aren   t exactly   you   re not exactly a four-point student, but that doesn   t mean you can   t still set the world on fire.    That was kind of his take on   that encouraged me a lot, I guess.  Milligan Was he one of the few people that sort of took that stance, or did you hear that more often?  Roberts I would say he was probably one of the few that I remember that kind of like,    Okay.    I mean,    If he thinks I   ve got to   ,    because I   d always heard about him, and heard he was a good guy, and pretty influential guy. It kind of validated me a little bit, I guess, that he believed enough in me to spend a little bit of time with me, and talk with me. Because coming from the school I came from, which was a smaller school, you get to OSU, and there was a few classes with three and four hundred people in them. You can kind of feel a little lost in the crowd a little bit, so   . 14  Milligan Yeah, and how was the transition academically? Did you feel, coming from Piedmont, that you were ready for college?  Roberts Yeah, and when I was in college, I took a few   college. When I was in high school, I took a few college courses in the summer, like college algebra and some stuff like that, that kind of   I did that at OSU Tech in Oklahoma City, so that kind of, I think, helped me a little bit get prepared for what it was going to be like transitioning to   .  Milligan Yeah, that   s a good thing to do, whenever you   re able to do it.  Roberts Yeah.  Milligan But the class size, you said, really was a big shift?  Roberts Oh, yeah  Yeah.  Milligan I imagine that if you had a graduating class of a hundred, your classes probably weren   t bigger than twenty kids, right?  Roberts Yeah, twenty probably.  Milligan So at what point   did that ever shift at OSU? Like I know a lot of times, the entry-level are the ones that are the really big ones.  Roberts Right. Yeah, I   d say probably by my junior year. You have certain...  Milligan When everything shifted? (Laughs)  Roberts    yeah, yep. When I declared a major, and yeah, those class sizes got a little smaller and more individualized, I would say.  Milligan What about Stillwater, because you said the first time that you came to visit it, you felt like it was more of a community sort of   I interpreted, built around the campus, but more of a community and sort of a space that was isolated. What did you feel about it when you actually got there?  Roberts I think it was pretty much what I expected. Like I say, a good friend of mine from my high school, he was a year older than me, he kind of told me a little bit about it, so it was about what I expected, you know. So, yeah   Milligan Did you get off campus very often?  Roberts I didn   t. I mean, being in the fraternity the first year, being a pledge you weren   t allowed to go home except certain times, which I think was a good 15  thing because it kind of helps you get there, and get established, and get involved, and be a part of it all. Then after all that, I just didn   t go home a lot except for the holidays and stuff, but kind of just enjoyed staying there. A couple of summers I did, I think it   s   maybe just one summer, I did summer school up there, and that was   I thought that was kind of a neat experience too because obviously the numbers go way down. You end up meeting a lot of different people that you hadn   t met before, and everybody kind of bonds together because you   re all kind of up there, kind of stuck on the island a little bit. Not that you   re stuck, but you know what I   m saying.  Milligan Yeah, right. The numbers are definitely fewer in Stillwater during the summer.  Roberts Right, so that was a fun summer.  Milligan What year was that   between what years?  Roberts That was     Milligan I think between junior and senior?  Roberts    eighty-eight. I think it was   yeah, junior and senior, I believe.  Milligan Okay. Well, and I wonder too, because   did you work much within the Stillwater community? Like, did your fraternity, for example, have service projects that they did or anything like that?  Roberts Yeah, we did. We did, what was that? Adopt-a-Highway, we did that, stuff like that a lot. Yeah, and there was always some kind of community something we were doing. It seemed like every year there was something, my memory   s skipping on some of it  (Laughs)  Milligan That   s okay. Well, if it doesn   t stand out, then it   s probably not even   not a part of driving your life. Yeah, I was just kind of curious. It   s always interesting to see how encouraged or how comfortable students have felt within the greater community. I   ve talked to a lot of students that don   t really   outside of like three blocks off campus, don   t really know what is in Stillwater   (laughs)  Roberts Yeah.  Milligan    which is perfectly fine  It   s just sort of interesting to see.  Roberts I would   ve probably fell into that category, yeah. Just   we did some things, but everything was pretty much focused on what was going on at the school.  16  Milligan Uh-huh, and then you had the Strip right there?  Roberts Uh-huh.  Milligan Was that a big part of Still   was that, at that time, still a big social point?  Roberts Yes. Yeah, it seemed like it was just kind of starting to come back. JR Murphy   s, that was   I don   t even know if that   s still there, that   s   yeah, so     Milligan Yeah.  Roberts    that was not too far from the Sigma Nu house there, so.... (Laughter)  Milligan That   s right off of Washington. Yeah, okay, that makes sense to me. Okay, so you were there from    85 to    89. When you graduated   you mentioned this a little bit, but let   s talk a little bit more through it     Roberts Okay.  Milligan    after you graduated, what is it that you did?  Roberts I went to Dallas, Texas, and sold cars, and did finance for about two years.  Milligan Why Dallas? I   m curious about that. Your dad would still have been in the industry at that point.  Roberts Yes, yeah. I   d worked at his dealership throughout high school and some in college, and I felt like I wanted to get out, see how somebody else did it. I kind of liked the Dallas idea, do it on a bigger scale, maybe. It was a very large dealership that I worked at, and so I thought that would be a good experience for me, so I was glad I did it.  Milligan Was it a good experience for you?  Roberts Yes, it was, it was   Milligan I wonder that too, did   how did you choose   I understand the wanting to be in a larger space, but how did you choose Dallas, and how did you choose specifically where you were?  Roberts I chose Dallas because I think it was far enough away, but not too far, and at the time, a few of my friends moved to Dallas, so that was kind of a draw. And then   what was the second part of the question?  Milligan How did you choose like where you landed? 17  Roberts What store?  Milligan Yeah.  Roberts It was the Nissan store, so I wanted to stay in that line, just because that   s what my dad had, and it was a friend of his that owned the store and he kind of made the connection. I interviewed and got the job.  Milligan That is good. You did   there was sort of a family   at least you all knew   your dad and this guy knew each other at least?  Roberts Yes. Yes, he had a big shop.  Milligan Oh, I   m sure that   in the industry in general, I   m sure that you know everybody within a five-hundred-mile radius (laughs) in the same car dealership line.  Roberts Yes.  Milligan You ended up working there for two years, did you say? Or did you? Yeah, you did.  Roberts Uh-huh, about two years.  Milligan Let   s talk a little bit about some of the differences between working in a space like that versus working in the Oklahoma City area, where you had worked in high school and college.  Roberts It wouldn   t   when I worked in Dallas, it was definitely more fast-paced, you know. The customer base, it just seemed like it was a little more    Go, go, go     Everybody wanted it done yesterday and not a lot of patience. Where in Oklahoma City, it was a little scaled down from that, and then you come to Pryor, and that   s what I love about the small town thing is it   s a little   just a little more geared down a little bit, and I kind of like that. You kind of really feel like you get to know your customers a little more than when they   re just coming at you in droves, like in Dallas.  Milligan Is it the number of customers that you   re dealing with that causes that, or is that like a sort of cultural mentality from the customer and the business side?  Roberts I would say a little bit of both of that, yeah. It   s just the pace of the city, so to say, and probably from the customer side and from the business side. It   s just   the culture just evolves to that.  18  Milligan Yeah, never thought about that as being a factor, but I can understand that.  Roberts I hadn   t really thought about that either until you mentioned this, (laughter) but it   s a good thought.  Milligan Yeah, and you also mentioned sort of your education component after that was with the NADA, correct?  Roberts Yes.  Milligan Tell me a little bit about that and your decision to go into that.  Roberts That was a   it was a program I   d always heard about. After I finished my stint in Dallas, I came back to Oklahoma City and started working with my father. About a year, year and a half after that, I got enrolled in the Dealer Academy, and the way the program worked   it was a two-year program. You would work, you would go to school for a week at some   it was   they had them all over the country, it was kind of a rotating deal, and then you would   like you might go study accounting the first week, and then you   d come back, and you   d spend nine weeks in the accounting department. After that nine weeks, you   d go study parts, and then they would bring you back in the parts department for eight or nine weeks, and there was always assignments. It was kind of on-the-job training. Anyway, you kind of worked your way around the dealership, so to say. Sales department, service, finance, accounting, so   .  Milligan Did you do that at another location, or did you do it within your dad   s dealership where you were at at the time?  Roberts Well, we went to school at another location, and then you would come home to your home dealership, and then you would work.  Milligan So you   d do   fulfill your assignments at home?  Roberts Yeah, so they   d give you like eight or nine weeks worth of assignments. You   d go work in the department, plus have assignments within the department, so   .  Milligan Was it   let me think how to phrase this. It seems like unless everybody in the dealership sort of knew that model, it seems like that might be a little weird to people. (Laughs) How did that go when you actually put that in practice?  Roberts Well, you know, it wasn   t too bad. It was just   it was a little bit like job shadowing, a little bit. As you got acclimated to things, you became one of the workforce, so you   wasn   t like you just sit there and observe the whole time. You   if you   re in the parts department, if there was a shipment of 19  sparkplugs, you   re getting them in off the truck and just being one of the employees.  Milligan Have you thought much about   you   ve already said that you felt that there was a value in that. Have you thought much about what that value really was then? Like what you really got out of that and would you recommend it to other people?  Roberts I would definitely recommend it to other people, and the value   my father even told me this. He said,    You know, you probably learned in two years, what it would take a lot of people ten to twelve years in the business to learn,    because it   s so condensed and focused. Yeah, I would definitely recommend it. In fact, we   re looking at possibly putting a couple of our employees in it, as we   ve grown.  Milligan Well, that is a testament for sure. Well, and I wonder   because it seems like since you had spent so much time in this dealership from when you were younger and sort of into your young adult years, it sounds like you had done, without the targeted education component of that, it sounds like you had sort of done this loose shadowing already, up to a point.  Roberts Uh-huh. Yes, to a point.  Milligan Yeah, so I wonder if you had a certain level of comfort in some of these areas that you might not have had growing up in that situation?  Roberts A little bit, but stuff like the accounting department stuff, I hadn   t...  Milligan They didn   t let you in as a thirteen-year-old? (Laughs)  Roberts    I keep coming back to accounting, don   t I? Yeah. As you can see, accounting is my     Milligan I can tell that   s where you really, really want to be  (Laughter)  Roberts     that   s the burr in the saddle. Yeah.  Milligan I get it. They wouldn   t let you in, you hold a grudge, I know. (Laughs)  Roberts Yeah. Actually they let me in. I realized I didn   t fit in when I got there. (Laughter)  Milligan I can understand that too. Well, yeah, that   s part of what I   m curious about, and that was   . Actually, that was one of the things, when I walked in the doors today to meet you, one of the initial questions I thought to myself, that I wanted to make sure that we talked about, was how you got into an 20  industry like this because it is   just even watching from your lobby, it is so complex  Like there are so many people doing so many things, and they all have to know what their roles are, they have to know what the message to the customer is. It   s a big machine   Roberts It is. There   s a lot of moving parts, and each one of them is   it   s like five separate businesses inside of one building.  Milligan Yeah, and that   s     Roberts You got your parts, service, new cars, used cars, and accounting, and finance, so I guess you could call it six.  Milligan Yeah, that makes total sense.  Roberts Then you   the talents   like a great parts manager. His skill set, his personality, is totally different than a great sales manager. You got to figure out how to get everybody working together because they are all so different because it takes different skill sets and different personality types to make these separate departments go.  Milligan Do you feel like that that is some of the   just even the human element of that, is that something you had to learn through experience, or is that something you could learn through the NADA?  Roberts A lot of that is you just learn from experience. A lot of that part of it   it   s just people and how to get teams to move in the same direction. That can be a challenge because everybody   s got a little bit different agenda, and everybody looks at things a little   through a different set of goggles, you know     Milligan Uh-huh.  Roberts    and it   s gotten even more complex as we have grown because we started out in Pryor with one dealership. Now we   ve got four, so now you   re not only trying to get departments in one store gelling and meshing together, then you   ve got to get stores with four, five different departments in each store, all coming together as one big machine, so to say. That can be a challenge.  Milligan Yeah   Roberts Communication is the key.  Milligan Well, is that communication, I guess, throughout the departments but also from the top-down it seems like? 21  Roberts Yes, and a lot of times, the message sent is not the message received. You think,    I was clear on that,    and sometimes you   re not, so I   ve had to work on that. A lot of times, I assume,    Well, didn   t everyone know what I was talking about?    and I wasn   t clear on it.  Milligan I think that   s most industries. (Laughs)  Roberts Right  Exactly, but as you get more people, it gets harder.  Milligan Well, and I wonder too, if choosing something like marketing helped you be able to maneuver that aspect of it, or whether it made a difference at all, like looking backwards?  Roberts Yeah, I think it did. I think some of the experiences in the fraternity house, like I   ve talked about with the rush chairman stuff, that helped a lot too because you   re coordinating, and you   re working through other people to get stuff done.  Milligan Uh-huh, so more practical application from that standpoint.  Roberts Yes.  Milligan That   s interesting  How did you end up in Pryor if your dad was in Oklahoma City, and that   s sort of where you were, it sounds like, being groomed, or choosing to be groomed for this industry?  Roberts Yes, then that was another thing that was kind of just an odd coincidence, but my dad had always said   he had a fishing cabin up on Grand Lake. He   d always said he would like to   as he got older, he   d like to maybe find a store in a small town, gear down a little bit, spend some time on the lake, not work as many hours. Anyway, I end up finding the Chevrolet store in Pryor, and said,    Hey Dad, this is for sale. What do you think?    We came and looked at the store, and at that time, it was   there was only twenty employees. They were selling forty or fifty cars a month. Anyway, we looked at it, and both agreed,    Hey, this would work,    and at that time, my dad was probably in his late fifties. The closer we got to maybe making this happen, he was like,    Eh, I   m not really sure that   s what I exactly want to do, but I think it   s a great opportunity if you want to do it.    At that time, I was twenty-nine, so twenty-nine, not married, didn   t have kids, I was like,    Shoot, let   s go      Milligan Uh-huh.  22  Roberts Yeah, came in and met   I think we had twenty-two employees when I walked in the door, and didn   t know anybody in Pryor. I   d never even been to Pryor, so   .  Milligan So how do you take over something like that? I mean, that   s a big transition. From being in what   s probably a little bit of a comfort zone, where you grew up and where you have been around, to moving into a space where you   re like,    Yeah, I don   t know the community. I don   t really know this company a hundred percent.    Even the product was a little bit different, with   I mean cars are cars, but Chevrolet versus Nissan. It was a Chevy when you bought it, right? That   s what you said.  Roberts Yeah. That was the first one. Yes, was the Chevrolet store. Not in this facility though, it was in a smaller facility downtown...  Milligan Oh  Okay     Roberts    but yes, this is the original store, so to say. First store.  Milligan Got it  Yeah, so how did you make that transition?  Roberts You just come in, you meet everybody, you talk. Get them   you talk about your experiences, your past, and get everybody to trust you and see your vision, and from there, you just start rolling. I mean, and then it   s a work in progress from there, so yeah, that was in   I came up here in    97 and, yeah, twenty-two employees, and now we   re 2016 and we got 206 employees.  Milligan Oh my gosh.  Roberts Yeah, so that   s been a learning process for me as well, as you go from twenty-two employees and now we   re at two h   every step along the way has been a learning process. How to manage   instead of managing people, now you   re managing teams, you know?  Milligan Yeah  Well, and how did you go about sort of deciding what growth points you were going to push on?  Roberts You know, it was a work-in-progress, to be honest with you. If you   d ask me, back then if I would have four of them and two hundred employees,    Well, probably not.    You set goals, and you start hitting goals, and you set new ones, and then you just kind   things keep rolling.  Milligan Some of your goals are written in OSU jerseys, so I don   t know   .  Roberts Exactly  (Laughter) Exactly.  23  Milligan Well, I think that it   s interesting that your dad chose, like decided this really wasn   t his dig, even though he really initially thought it was.  Roberts Right, yeah.  Milligan Did he ever   I mean, so he sold his store in 2000     Roberts Right.  Milligan    so you hadn   t been here that long     Roberts Correct.  Milligan    so what did he do with his store, and what did he do after that? What happened with your dad?  Roberts Well, he...yeah, he sold his about three years after we got here. Yeah, so for awhile, I was running this one, he was running that one, and he sold out and retired. Played some golf, he was a big bird hunter, and so he did a lot of guided hunts. Did that for a while. He was good friends with the Dobsons, out at the Dobson ranch, so he would train a lot of their bird dogs and take people on hunts.  Milligan Cool  Is the Dobson ranch somewhere around here? Haven   t heard of it.  Roberts No, it   s out in the Cheyenne area. Out in far western Oklahoma     Milligan Yeah, far western. I was thinking it was   .  Roberts    right on the Oklahoma Texas line.  Milligan Got it.  Roberts Yeah, so he spent a lot of time out there after he retired.  Milligan That makes sense. I was thinking that was where the bird hunting area of the state was, but if that   s so far away from where you   re at     Roberts Oh, yeah  It   s   from here, it   s forever.  Milligan Didn   t retire until like   but you did  Not retire, but ended up sort of on the water it sounds like, in the area.  Roberts Right.  24  Milligan Well, let   s talk a little bit about   I   m curious. Now that you have done everything that you   ve done with your business, and you   ve moved forward this fast, looking backwards at your time at OSU, I don   t know that you needed to go school to do what you   re doing. I   m curious about that because you had so much   you had so many mentorship possibilities along the way. I   m curious if you think that your time at OSU either intellectually was useful or whether it was   or if it did anything for you toward your greater goal?  Roberts It definitely did. It was   intellectually, definitely. Socially, just the connections you make there. I grew up too. That was a big deal. I think without that experience, being away from home   that was a big part of it. Making   the connections made at OSU, they   re still some of my best friends. Most of my best friends are from Oklahoma State, and the connections...they   re huge. Even   well, like Callie  Connolly , you met down there, we went to OSU at the same time together.  Milligan Oh, did you? (Laughs)  Roberts Yeah, so you got a lot of good friends, and then you got some that you kind of know, and then   I mean, it   s kind of like that seven people away from whatever. It   s just   it   s   there   s a lot of stuff that   s been   opportunities have been opened up.  Milligan It sounds like a lot of networking has happened since that time. Well, I   m curious, too, in just you and the coursework. Was there anything specifically   other than this relationship you had with your adviser. The coursework that you did or the classwork, was there anything that was impactful for you to sort of move things forward as you have?  Roberts I think it was just a good base and a good foundation to take that next step. Probably the next step of the education was the NADA Dealer Academy. Had I not had that base, the foundation, I probably wouldn   t have done as well there as I did, but I was definitely prepared for that. There was some people that were in the program that had not had the college experience, and I felt like I was definitely ahead of the curve there because of, like I say, the foundation I had at Oklahoma State.  Milligan Was it more built on like business modeling and the marketing aspects of the job or   ?  Roberts Yeah, exactly. I think I would say all of that.  Milligan Well, it   s an interesting business. Not having walked into Pryor before you moved here and started a pretty good size business, or took over a pretty 25  good size business. Tell me a little bit about the community now and sort of what you   how you feel like your business is situated within it.  Roberts Well, that was one of the first things   the first strategies we had, but the marketing strategy was get involved in the community. We   ve gotten heavily involved in like the FFA programs. We started that from day one up until now, and so community   s been a big part of building this business here. That   s where we started on the marketing side. Then obviously we get more into the advertising, TV, radio, and all that stuff, but the base layer of that is we   re involved in the community. In fact, we   ve grown to a point that I have a marketing and events coordinator. That   s her title, and that   s what she does is she organizes things within the community. That   s how much we feel like the community is important to what we   re doing, because we have somebody dedicated just for that.  Milligan Uh-huh, it makes sense. I   m curious how you   you mentioned specifically, with the agricultural area, and it sounds like getting involved through probably sponsorships and things like that, right?  Roberts Uh-huh.  Milligan Is that what I   m hearing? Okay. So how did you know that that was a specific area that was important? Did you meet people in the community that helped you identify that, or is that something you were able to evaluate yourself?  Roberts I met some people in the community and they helped me identify that. In fact, I think about the second or third week I was even here, they said,    Hey  Why don   t you come out to the Mayes County Premium Sale?    I went out there, and I was like,    Wow  I   ve never been to something like this,    so anyway, that kind of set the stage. Mayes County does a great job with all their ag programs, and there   s a   from what I hear, their sale   s one of the biggest in the state, and it   s very heavily supported by the business owners.  Milligan Do you think that before you purchased this business that they were doing much of that community outreach?  Roberts They were doing some, but we definitely took it to another level, and then have continued to step that up, I believe.  Milligan That leads me into the direction of   if you were in a mentorship role with other recent, or about to graduate, students from the business school at OSU, what would be some of the lessons that you take from your sort of entire time, college, through college, and where you   re at now? What would be some of the key lessons that you think would be important for them to carry with them? 26  Roberts I think, probably reputation. Over time, if you do things right, good things will start to fall in your lap later when you get older like I have   I mean, some of the successes I have had have come from deals that were done way back stream, that were done right. A few things have fallen in my lap that I didn   t have   had to work real hard for them way back then, but maybe it gets a little easier if you do it the right way. I would say when you   re doing a deal, it   s got to be a win-win for both sides of the table. If not, it   s not that great of a deal. Took me a while to figure that out, but once you do that, you find out what the seller or the buyer wants. If you can give them what they want, and you get what  you  want, everybody wins, and that   s a great deal.  Milligan What do you think the hard part of that lesson was to learn? Was it from the    give them more of what they need    or    I need more?    I mean   .  Roberts I think probably just the competitiveness maybe. As a younger person, you want to win, you want to do this, but then you realize if you   and I   m not just talking cars. I   m talking some real estate deals and all that. If you find out what   whoever   s on the other side of the table, if they   re buying or selling, find out what they   re trying to accomplish. If you can accomplish what you   re trying to accomplish, and they can accomplish what they   re trying to accomplish within the deal, that   s a great deal     Milligan That   s good advice.  Roberts    and there will be more of those down the road because that word gets out that that was a great deal, and so   .  Milligan That   s part of that reputation building.  Roberts Yeah, I think so. You can   t do it all the time, and I   ve had to say many times,    We are just going to   we   re going to part friends.    We just didn   t make a deal. It   s not that big of deal. I think that would be another good piece of advice is that every deal doesn   t have to be life-threatening, and that everybody gets emotionally involved in trying to put transactions together, but.... You might not put a deal together today, but a year from now you might get together again, and it works for whatever reason.  Milligan Yeah. It   s interesting, too, when   . The first thing you said was about reputation, and I think that   s something that society as a whole right now is struggling with imparting to young people, about this idea of the reputation that you build. Especially now in the digital age, as young as you can possibly think it   s important to maintain, your   not just your front face forward to the public, but sort of your actual presence in digital society, but also society in general. It   s interesting to me that that   s sort one of the key 27  things because it is   that   s like the life lesson we keep trying to say, like everything you do impacts something else you want to do down the road.  Roberts Right, yeah. I might   I don   t want to sound like an old fogy, but I probably will. (Laughter) I don   t   I think a lot of times when people have differences or   let me just put it this way. I think there are certain things that need to be talked about face-to-face and not on social media. I think that   s something that   I don   t know that that getting face-to-face ever goes out of style because even text messaging, you can say one thing, and it   s been interpreted totally the wrong way. Just like the reason you have this camera, so you can see facial expressions, and hand motions, and whatever. If I was doing this all by text, it might be interpreted a whole different way.  Milligan Very true, yeah. No, that   s very true.  Roberts I would say keep the positive stuff on social media, and the negative stuff get face-to-face with people and work out your differences.  Milligan Well, and I like the fact that you can articulate that not everything has to end in perfect harmony, like there can be discordance and it   s okay.  Roberts Right. It   s kind of that agree to disagree sometimes. It just happens, it doesn   t make either side a bad person. You just couldn   t put a   you just couldn   t come to whatever, a deal, or a resolution of whatever it is.  Milligan What do you think has been some of the largest challenges taking this business, and it   s close to twenty years, right, since you   ve been in it, this business from a twenty-two person to basically four businesses that are at least doubled in size from each of those businesses from your original? What would be some of the lessons, looking back, that you can say helped push you here, or helped inform you to make the decision to go this direction?  Roberts I would say you   ve got to have great people because once you   ve   you can   t do it all yourself. I have a lot of people that make me look really good, they really do  I have a saying that I   m smart enough to know that I   m too dumb to do this by myself. You   ve got to surround yourself with good people. I know that   s a clich   too, but that   s a lot of truth there, and I think   to me, the trust factor with your team members: low trust, low speed. If everybody is trusting each other and got the same goals in mind, the organization can move fast, but whenever those trust factors   and we struggle with it daily, don   t get me wrong, but whenever some of the trust   . Is everybody on the same page or do we have different agendas, whenever that starts breaking down, the growth stalls. I think there   s been periods that I   ve learned that when we get everybody on the same page, and everybody   s 28  singing out of the same book, things really start moving. Then there   s other times we haven   t, you know, so I think that   s a big deal.  Milligan Yeah, yeah. That makes sense. Okay, I have one more question, because I know we   ve got a little bit of a deadline.  Roberts Okay.  Milligan Looking back at your dad having been in this industry, and your history as well, do you have something in your mind, that when you think back to what you have learned from your dad   s work in this industry, that has helped inform the way that you do business, or anything that kind of, from him, that carries you forward a little bit?  Roberts Yeah, that picture back there. My dad used to have a saying that    If you protect the pump, the pump will take care of you,    and the pump was always the business. Kind of the thought behind it was, and probably don   t have enough time to go into all of it, but the thought was if we all put the pump first and ourselves second, the pump (the business) will prosper, and we   ll all prosper because of it. If we start abusing the pump, if we start abusing the business, using it for personal gains, any number of things, but put yourself second and the business first in this arena. I   m not saying always, but I   m just saying that when you   re at work, respect the business. That   s probably been the best advice because a lot of the times with success, we all get   you get some greed factor coming or whatever, and then we start using the business for personal gains, and then the next thing you know, the business starts to dwindle. We   ve got to take care of the business first. I don   t know if that makes sense     Milligan It totally does   Roberts    but he used to call it    the pump,    so that   s why we have that up there. Yeah.  Milligan I like that, that   s interesting. Okay.  Roberts That   s what you were looking for? That was deep  (Laughs)  Milligan Yes  No, actually   yes, I was looking for something just that deep. I think it   s good because we take things away in different ways, and since you   ve been   . Your interaction with your dad   s work has come at such different points in your life, right? You had like this younger interaction with it, and you went away, and then you had sort of like this midlife, and then you went away, so it   s interesting  I was just   that   s what I was curious about. Sort of after all of that, what was the thing that you pulled from all of that.  29  Roberts Yeah.  Milligan That   s a good articulation of it. Yeah. All right  Well, is there anything else you want to talk about?  Roberts I don   t think so.  Milligan Yeah? Okay   Roberts I think I about covered it.  Milligan Okay. (Laughs)  Roberts I guess.  Milligan Well, really appreciated your time, and it has been interesting to hear sort of how your time at OSU, and why you chose to go there     Roberts Right.  Milligan    has informed some of this latter stuff.  Roberts Yeah. It   s been a long time since I   ve had to recall some of it. (Laughs)  Milligan It doesn   t ever have to be perfect  That   s why I do a lot of fishing just to see sort of like what you do remember but   .  Roberts Yeah  You did great, and I hope this is what you were looking for.  Milligan This is perfect. All right, I   m going to     -------  -------
