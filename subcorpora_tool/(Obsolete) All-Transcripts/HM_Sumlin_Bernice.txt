Story_ID: 435794
Speaker 1: I'm gonna start with the questions, the AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] leadership questions and then we'll get into our regular interview.  The first question that that we have here is what influenced your decision to seek the position of supreme basileus?
Speaker 2: Well, I think to seek the position, I don't recall seeking the position but I was asked by a group of sorors after I was the Great Lakes regional director to run for the position of supreme basileus, which I did.  And I was elected the supreme basileus of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the nineteenth supreme basileus of Alpha Kappa Alpha, 1946 [sic. 1974].
Speaker 1: Okay.  How would you describe your ascension to supreme basileus?
Speaker 2: I think it was an excellent one.  When they called me and asked me if I would consider running for supreme I was really shocked and I said, "Do you think I can win?"  And they said yes, I think you can win.  I said at least I'll try it and I did.  So then I formulated a group of people across the country that I thought could be helpful in helping me to win across the country, not just one state but I had to run to, as the national president across the whole state of the United States which I did and was success--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what propelled your, your candidacy for supreme basileus?
Speaker 2: Well, the fact that I had been a, an excellent one, an excellent regional director.  And I was asked by soror Larzette Hale [HistoryMaker Larzette Hale-Wilson], who was at that time the supreme basileus, to chair the committee [National Standards Committee] that she asked me to chair across the country and I was delighted to do so.  I was hesitant as to which one of the committees it was at that particular time, I can't think of it right now, but anyway I chaired that committee and we were successful.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Hold on just a, pause for one, one second.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  You have speed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, let's go back a little bit and correct something that we got, have, had mistaken before.  You joined Alpha Kappa Alpha in 19 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) As an undergraduate--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in 1946.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you became supreme basileus in 1974, I believe, right?
Speaker 2: In 1974, that is correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you served--
Speaker 2: And I served for four years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Until 1978?
Speaker 2: That--
Speaker 1: Black this out, we'll, we'll do it again and I'll just, you just tell us that part yourself without me asking you a question in the middle.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And would, then it'll be all one block of information (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (CHARLENE TRUITT-NELSON):  (Simultaneous) I was supreme basileus--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (CHARLENE TRUITT-NELSON):  --in 1974 through 1978.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (CHARLENE TRUITT-NELSON):  That's what you need to say.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  And when she joined.
Speaker 2: (CHARLENE TRUITT-NELSON):  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And--
Speaker 2: (CHARLENE TRUITT-NELSON):  --you joined the sorority in 1946.

Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.

Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yes, we're rolling (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Thanks.
Speaker 2: Alpha, I joined Alpha Kappa Alpha as an undergraduate at Wilberforce [Combined Normal and Industrial Department at Wilberforce University; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] in 1976, 1974 [sic. 1946].
Speaker 1: No.  You should probably write it down, you know, 'cause you keep getting the '74 [1974] mixed up with '46 [1946].
Speaker 2: (CHARLENE TRUITT-NELSON): Right.
Speaker 1: Well, what you wanna say, say is 1946 first and then--
Speaker 2: (CHARLENE TRUITT-NELSON): Right.
Speaker 1: --then 1976.
Speaker 2: (CHARLENE TRUITT-NELSON): Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.

Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in 1974.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think that'll work, yes.
Story_ID: 435795
Speaker 1: Now we'll move on to questions about your leadership.  And it says here, what was your vision for Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: My vision for Alpha Kappa Alpha has always been one of high scholarship for undergrads, for our undergraduates all across the nation.  I've always stressed the importance of good scholarship and encouraged our undergraduates to always be the best, whatever it is, to be the best and to seek high scholarship.  And they have done that and done it quite well, especially our undergraduate chapters.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what or who influenced your vision for Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated?
Speaker 2: I must say that the person who influenced my decision about Alpha Kappa Alpha was our past presidents and presidents that I had worked with or worked in their administration.  And I must accredit the person who encouraged me to run for the supreme basileus was soror, Larzette Hale [HistoryMaker Larzette Hale-Wilson], Dr. Larzette Hale--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let--
Speaker 2: --a past president.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's, let's pause here a second.  And just give people a (unclear)--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.  Okay.  What or who influenced your vision for Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated?
Speaker 2: I was told by teachers during my senior year in college [sic. Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Early College High School, Dayton, Ohio], they had what was known at that time as breakfast for the senior girls.  And at that time a number of my teachers were members of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority and they invited a group of senior girls to join them, it was St. Elizabeth Episcopal Church [ph.] and I attended that breakfast for girls finishing high school.  And at least three or four of my teachers, Mrs. Ruth Smith [ph.], and Louise McBain [Louise Clark McBain], and others talked to us about the sorority.  And at that time I had an aunt who was an Alpha Kappa Alpha person, married to a bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal church.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was the beginning.
Story_ID: 435796
Speaker 1: In what ways was your vision designed to ensure Alpha Kappa Alpha's [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] survival?
Speaker 2: I think that Alpha Kappa Alpha's survival has always been one of the things that we were always asked to stress the importance of good scholarship, whether they were in high school or if they were finishing high school, to always seek to be scholars when they got to college.  And I had a number of teachers who were members of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How was your vision communicated and carried out through the sorority's program during your administration?
Speaker 2: During my administration I always stressed that they encourage undergrads to be active, to maintain high scholarship.  We stressed that as ivy leaves at the university.  And I continued to stress that as I moved into the role as the nineteenth supreme basileus.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What kinds of things did you specifically do to successfully communicate your vision and effectively institutionalize it as a guiding principle?
Speaker 2: I always stressed that the undergraduates work for high scholarship, for high scholarship and program planning, that they considered that in moving ahead.  I think that was one of the most important points at that time--
Story_ID: 435797
Speaker 1: Now these questions are about your leadership style.  Which leadership style did you use to bring your vision to fruition?
Speaker 2: I would think that the leadership style was one of being an academic student that stressed the importance of high scholarship.  I've always encouraged high scholarship from the beginning.  And other programs such as the desire to be the best in whatever kinds of positions they were interested in going, always seek high esteem and good scholarship and be the best.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how was your vision, I'm, I'm sorry.  What kinds of things, oh, wait a minute, I'm sorry, I've got the wrong, okay.  As the individual with the ultimate responsibility for making decisions which would shape AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.], what was the fundamental test that you applied?
Speaker 2: I think the best test that we had in seeking the best was our form of scholarship number one, high esteem, and to just be the best, that's all I can say.  I've always stressed that if you're gonna be a part of it be the best that they have.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, which former supreme's [supreme basileus] leadership style, if any, did yours parallel most, I guess?
Speaker 2: I would think there were three supremes that I attempted to emulate, that was L. Pearl Mitchell [Lottie Pearl Mitchell], Larzette Hale [HistoryMaker Larzette Hale-Wilson], and Arnetta Wallace [Arnetta G. McKamey Wallace].  All of those three are the women that I respected and attempted to emulate.
Story_ID: 435798
Speaker 1: Now these are, this section is entitled supreme encounters.  Ma'am, what did you learn about leadership while serving as supreme basileus [of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Well, I learned one thing in my role as supreme basileus that there was a lot of things that you had to take.  You had to take all kinds of feelings, you had to take into, to consideration, everybody's feelings.  And I learned early in my administration that I considered those feelings or how they felt about projects, if they didn't want to do them, I would encourage them on that, of saying, "If you don't, you do not wish to follow that or to follow this regime at the present time, let us know ahead of time and we can change our plans to move in a new direction."  And they seemed to have agreed with that.  They, they didn't want to counter programs that they didn't think would be successful, had a very excellent directorate when I was supreme.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what lesson or lessons were learned that were most instructive for you?
Speaker 2: Read that question again, please.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What lessons or, or lesson learned was most instructive for you?
Speaker 2: I think the lessons learned was to listen.  I think it was at that time that I learned the importance of listening to what everybody thought before I made any final decisions about any kind of program.
Story_ID: 435799
Speaker 1: Ma'am, what was the greatest challenge or controversy that you faced, and, and how did you respond?
Speaker 2: I think the greatest challenge was I started what is known as the Negro College Fund Drive.  And we set our goal as to raise a half a million dollars for the United Negro College Fund Drive.  We raised a million and had only set our goal as a half million.  And the women were excited about being the first to support the United Negro College Fund Drive.  So we supported that with a half million dollars and raised a million.  And, of course, that made headlines across the United States.  We were very, very proud of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was that, well, was there a, a, I guess, a, any big controversy when you were supreme basileus?
Speaker 2: I don't think I would say that we had controversy about any particular goal at that time because we had set our goals and that was to raise a half, to raise a half million and we raised a million.  Of course, we were all stunned at that and very happy about that.  And I think it united women, across the country from one end of the country to the other they started to become active again, those who were inactive became active to help us raise this million, this half million dollars.  And at the end of the four years we'd raised a million.  We had only set out to raise a half a million but we raised a million.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And we've been moving ahead ever since.  So we only do projects unless they're a million dollars or more.  And that has been encouraging to me because before that time we couldn't even think of a million dollars but we learned to, to raise, to think of a million dollars, and now we have projects where we raise $5, $10 million for worthwhile projects.
Speaker 1: Okay.  On whom did you rely for counsel and guidance when responding to challenges or controversy?
Speaker 2: We had what is known as the board of directors that are elected by Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] sorors from one end of the country to the other.  And we had regional directors in each one of our regions.  And in each one of the regions I had strong women who knew what to do or planned to do.  Our region, the Great Lakes Region is the region in which I'm in.  And we've had women and Chicago [Illinois] is where our national headquarters is located in Chicago, Illinois.  And in Great Lakes we have Michigan and West Virginia, Ohio, and I think that those are the regions.  And we've had strong women there ready to move for any project that we wanted to have.  We had close, at one time, over three thousand women in Great Lakes.
Story_ID: 435800
Speaker 1: Describe an irritation that spurred you to action.
Speaker 2: I think that one was the, to stress the importance of how we pledge, how we bring people into the sorority [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.].  And I think the present supreme basileus [HistoryMaker Barbara McKinzie] has done a good job in stressing the importance of our undergrads across the country.  And I think that we're seeing changes there in their process of incoming members and other programs and their undergraduate programs has been strengthened I think through the present supreme.
Story_ID: 435801
Speaker 1: The question was, by what standards would you measure the success of your administration?
Speaker 2: I had a successful administration.  I think we raised our half million dollars for the United Negro College Fund Drive.  At that time they have raised more than a million dollars for projects throughout Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.].  We don't think of just one million [dollars] now, they think about two or three million dollars in programs that they sponsor.
Speaker 1: Okay. What one thing would you like to have done that you were unable to accomplish?
Speaker 2: I think everything I wanted to accomplish I accomplished during that time and during that period.  I didn't leave anything undone.  When the next president [Barbara K. Phillips] came in, she had something to move on and Alpha Kappa Alpha has been moving ahead ever since my administration.
Story_ID: 435802
Speaker 1: It is said that we do not remember days, we remember moments.  As supreme basileus what was your greatest moment, your proudest moment, your happiest moment?
Speaker 2: I think one of the happiest moments I had was when I brought all of the national presidents who were living and able to come to the national headquarters and I brought them and they were so thrilled.  We had, at that time we had a national president that was a, that was moving toward a 102 years old, and I brought all of them together at our, at our headquarters.  And they enjoyed that meeting.  We had a meeting in which they sat down and they had a chance to talk to one another.  That's the first time we had had them together and to have them all together at our national headquarters in Chicago [Illinois], they were very elated and excited and they never forgot talking about it, would forget talking about it or thanking me for that opportunity of bringing them all together.  And they had a chance to go to the then dinner and we just rode them around Chicago, our national headquarters, and they were so elated.  They were women then that was eighty, most of them were in their nineties, and we had some that was moving toward a hundred and we were able to have them all in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Now, were these ladies the founders of AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: They were national presidents.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think we had one founder living or I buried the last of our founders during my administration.  And we buried her in Washington, D.C.  But I buried two of our founders during my administration.
Story_ID: 434347
Speaker 1: Ma'am, what kind of feedback did you get from the organization for your programs?
Speaker 2: I had marvelous, marvelous feedback from the directorate, to the national office, all over the country they helped with the United Negro College Fund [United Negro College Fund Drive].  And they were very helpful in local programs and I appreciated the cooperation given by the various regional directors as well as the director.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Compare the Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] that you inherited from your predecessor [HistoryMaker Mattelia B. Grays] to the one that you left for your successors?
Speaker 2: We had never had a mass program of, like the United Negro College Fund [UNCF] of sponsoring a national organization.  I think we went national during my administration, to think of national organizations like the United Negro College Fund, that was a big organization and we decided to sponsor that organization because it was just beginning to blossom, to come into the forefront and we said let's go with the United Negro College Fund.  And they were delighted at that time, they needed all the help they could get because they were just getting up off the ground and we took that on and raised for them their first half million and they've been able to go from then on, to, 'til the present day.  And we were instrumental in helping them get their telethon up off the ground and we helped them sponsor the first telethon that they ever had for the United Negro College Fund.  And, of course, it's given yearly now throughout the United States.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is this the contribution that you think had the most impact during your administration?
Speaker 2: It is the organization that helped us.  And from that we went on to assist other like the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and the Urban League [National Urban League], we have assisted a number of organizations since our work was known with the UNCF.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what accomplishments of your administration do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: The United Negro College Fund Drive and our contribution to Wilberforce University [Wilberforce, Ohio].
Story_ID: 434348
Speaker 1: On the past, the present, and the future, what key elements of the sorority's heritage or legacy have been powerful enough to keep AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] vibrant through the test of time?
Speaker 2: Well, I think our stress on scholarship.  We have stressed that all the way through, scholarship.  And we contribute through our fundraising for scholarship and I think that is so important for our undergraduates, those are our undergraduate college students, to stress the importance of good scholarship.  Scholarship is my thing.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: I think that's because, you know, being in education I, I know how important it is that students stress good scholarship and they have good scholarship.  And when they have good scholarship they'll make it through their undergrad, graduate days.  And I think that it's important that we continue to stress the importance of good scholarship.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What one thing is essential to ensure that we walk rather than back into the next one hundred years?
Speaker 2: I think that, I was going to say I don't think we need to walk, we need to run (laughter) for the race that's before us, you know, especially with our undergrads that we must continue to stress to them the importance of not walking but running.  That they make that the run for the, for, for the top, regardless what it is, that they stress the importance of getting to the top and we will not accept anything less than good scholarship.
Story_ID: 434349
Speaker 1: What has the sisterhood dimension taken a back, I'm sorry.  Has the sisterhood dimension taken a back seat to our pledge to be of service to all mankind?
Speaker 2: No, I think we have stressed this and we continue to stress it.  Throughout this country you will find in all of our chapters there is a dimension that says, the best scholarship, good scholarship, have the best, give it the best that you've got.  And you will find that in all of our fundraising, you will find that we have good scholarship.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What do you perceive to be the greatest threat to the survival of the sorority [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: I really have not looked at that dimension of the sorority.  I know that our undergrads are being encouraged by the present supreme [supreme basileus] to stress good scholarship and to have good scholarship.  And she [HistoryMaker Barbara McKinzie], I have noticed that in, in, in some of her articles that she has taken the time to encourage the undergraduates to increase their scholarship and I like that very much.
Story_ID: 434350
Speaker 1: Ma'am, what elements of the sorority [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] must be maintained or, or changed to ensure a perfect sisterhood?
Speaker 2: I think we want to continue to stress the importance of program, I think we must have good programs.  And along with good programs we're back to my main focus of good scholarship.  And as long as we stress good scholarship, top scholarship, that we will continue to be here for years to come.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, ma'am, the last question is what is your vision of the perfect sisterhood?
Speaker 2: Perfect, perfect, perfect, the perfect sisterhood will continue to encourage membership, scholarship, and a group that's involved in program.  And I think it's important that we stress in the coming years good programming to involve scholarship, womanhood, and the future for good planning.  I think it's so important that we take time to plan for scholarship and for programs that involve our youth.  And I hope that in the future that we will stress our youth and their promise for the future.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you.
Story_ID: 434351
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth about your, your, your, your history, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that the office asked me to ask everyone and they only require a short answer.  The first question is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Food?  No, I do not have a favorite food.  I like sweet potato pie because my mother [Gussie Bigham Sumlin] was an excellent cook, so I never favored just one food, we had to eat a variety of foods and she never settled on one.  If we were going to have some vegetables, she would fix what my brother [Oliver Sumlin] liked and she would also fix what I liked.  He did not like corn, I didn't either so she never bothered so much with corn but I like green beans, I could always count on the vegetable being green beans for me and peas for him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So she was such an excellent cook and she, she enjoyed cooking.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Now, I'm, I'm gonna ask about her later.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, but I just wanted to know if you had a favorite food.  And the second question is, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Color?  Yes, I like pink and green.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Laughter) Of course.  And do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I've always liked fall, the fall part of the year, that's my birthday time, too--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --November.  So I've always loved the fall, at the beginning of the turning of the trees.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I've always liked that.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I have traveled halfway around the world.  I've been very, very fortunate in that during the summer months I use that for travel.  A lot of people use it for a lot of things, but I used it for travel.  And I decided that I wanted to see the world.  And so therefore I started traveling from the suggestion of Mrs. Haithcock [ph.], one of my teachers, she said, "All you young ones should start traveling while you are now young.  Don't wait 'til you get old because you have all kind of ailments but all of you young teachers ought to start now.  Every summer you ought to go somewhere in the world."  And I took her at her word.  And so I had a friend and we traveled during the summer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I always liked poetry and having gone to Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Early College High School, Dayton, Ohio], I always picked up Paul Laurence Dunbar's works.  And I always, years ago I could recite Paul Laurence Dunbar with ease, with no reference or anything just automatically, I had it, his poems and so forth and I would do that when I was coming along during my childhood days.  I would always recite them during the, any kind of carnivals or anything they had at church, they would always call on me to recite one of Dunbar's poems.
Speaker 1: Now, can you remember any, any of the, a line or two for us?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I'll think about it--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --along the way.  But I was trying to think before you even asked the question what, what were some of those poems but they don't seem to come to me right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, if you think of 'em before (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the end, we'll, we'll talk about 'em.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 434352
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your family history now.  And I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Wright Sumlin] side but we'll start with your mother's side first. Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Gussie, G-U-S-S-I-E, Sumlin, S-U-M-L-I-N [Gussie Bigham Sumlin].
Speaker 1: What is, what is her--
Speaker 2: Big--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Big, Bigham, B-I-G-H-A-M.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Sumlin.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her birth was October, I've forgotten the year, I don't have it, I have it at home, you know, it's in the Bible.
Speaker 1: Was she born around 1900?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They married in 1917.  They married and moved, she moved to Dayton [Ohio] in 1917, she--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --my mother or her, my father, she and my father moved to Dayton in 1917.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm gonna ask about that but I, I wanted to ask about her side of the family first.  Did, did, where was she born, do you know?
Speaker 2: She was born in Georgia.
Speaker 1: Do you know what town in Georgia?
Speaker 2: Douglasville.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Douglasville, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Douglasville, okay.  Do you know what that's near--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --in Georgia?  Is it near Atlanta [Georgia] or--
Speaker 2: Near Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Now, what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  Can you trace them all the way back to slavery days or--
Speaker 2: No, I can trace, her mother stayed in Atlanta for years.  She had one sister and she lived to be in her nineties.  And her name was Addie, A-D-D-I-E.
Speaker 1: That's the sister?
Speaker 2: The sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 2: Seemingly they had property on my father's side.  And when they came to Dayton, they, they came because my uncle, my aunt's husband, had gotten a job at the Cadillac place, I think, a Dayton Cadillac company [Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company], it was just starting.  And that's the first place they worked.  And the second place was the Dayton Malleable Iron [Dayton Malleable Iron Company].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Malleable Iron Company.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And they worked there, then my father decided to go into business for himself as a sewer contractor and so he went to school or somewhere for being a sewer contractor for the Dayton, Dayton Public Schools, not Dayton Public Schools--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the City of Dayton, City of Dayton (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Dayton City, City of Dayton.

Story_ID: 435804
Speaker 1: Is there a story that your parents [Gussie Bigham Sumlin and Wright Sumlin] told about how they met and fell in love?
Speaker 2: Yeah, if they told it, I forgot it.  Yeah, 'cause they used to tell us everything.  They only had two children, and had waited twelve years, they were married like eleven years and that was before my brother was born.  And my mother said her story was always that they had said well, we're gonna be childless and had adopted a nephew and her sister's son.  And I recall him, Odell [Odell Sumlin], he was about twelve or thirteen when my brother was born.  She said that she was just staying sick so often, said she said, "Well, what is wrong with me?"  And Dr. O.D. McFall [Owen D. McFall, Sr.], was the first black doctor, he and Dr. Gunn [ph.], were the two black doctors in the City of Dayton [Ohio] and my mother said she went to, she had been feeling so bad and went to the doctor and they didn't tell women at that time that they were pregnant, you know, they'd tell their husband.  And so she said that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, wait a minute we have to pause on this one.  They wouldn't tell women that they were pregnant, the doctor would--
Speaker 2: They didn't tell the women that they were pregnant.
Speaker 1: They would tell their husbands first?
Speaker 2: That's right, they had to tell their husbands.  So she said that she had been so sick and so she told dad, "Daddy," she said, "I said to Daddy, 'Daddy, I am so sick, I just wake up in the mornings and I'm so sick,'" and he said, "Oh, really?  Well, we better go to the doctor."  So when she went to the doctor, the doctor told both of them together that they were, that she was pregnant.  She said, "I didn't know what to do," she said, "Twelve years," I think she waited almost close to twelve years before her first child was born, that was my brother.  She said she was so happy.  And sure enough she said she was pregnant then Oliver [Oliver Sumlin] was, was born and she said she was going along fine and she got sick again, said she said to my father, she said, "Daddy, something is wrong," and went back to the doctor, and he told her she was pregnant again, said she couldn't believe it.  And that's when I was born.  So she said out of all those years they only had two children, she wanted twelve, (laughter) said she had two.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was it.
Story_ID: 435805

She said she was so glad when I come along, she said because they knew he would talk because she was not a talker, nor was he, my brother.  So she said, "Oh, my heavens," she said, "what would we do if this," my, me and my brother said that he never talked much, they were not talkers, she, but my father was a talker.  So she said oh, she was so happy when I come along.  So she said, "She start talking, she had been talking ever since (laughter)."  She said because I was the one that was the talker, had something going on all the time.  Said if hadn't been for me she doesn't think that she and my brother would have ever talked.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Just were not talkers.  She was not a talker, my father was the talker.  But she was not a talker, she said and my brother to this--

Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: The sights was the Classic Theater [Dayton, Ohio] and the, and the Palace Theater [Dayton, Ohio] are the two recreation places where we went for movies.  They were on 5th Street.  And the sounds, they would bring the men and they would have their affairs at the Palace Theater, had the, the Palace Theater was the ballroom and we would have our dances up there.  And they would have dances on Saturday and that's when they would bring in Count Basie, Cab Calloway, we saw all of them at the Classic.

Speaker 2: And we could always stop at Cox's Drugstore [Dayton, Ohio], they were the druggist at that time.  And we stopped there and got ice cream and everything that we wanted, get our sodas, and what have you.  We stopped there and Cox's Drugstore had everything for us, so we would stop there on our way from the theater, from the Classic Theater.  And they had popcorn, everything we needed, they had at the, at the Classic.  After we'd leave the theater you'd stop at Cox's Drugstore, we stopped for our popcorn, we stopped for our things, until they brought Velvet [ph.].  And I never will forget the Velvet drugstores that they, they put on the west side at that time.  And so then we had the Velvet Drugstore and we had Cox's Drugstore.  And Cox was known for making their own ice cream and everything so every Sunday you always stopped at Cox's and pick up all your ice cream to go with your pie.

Speaker 1: --on 5th Street, the Fifth Street Y [Fifth Street YMCA, Dayton, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I think it was, was, was, it the first--
Speaker 2: It was--
Speaker 1: --black Y in--
Speaker 2: --the first black Y and it was the newest and it was large, it had a cafeteria, and they had it open for years where people could eat there.  It was the only place that people would go to eat if you were in that area.  And they served lunch, I was trying to think, I've forgotten the name of the lady who served the lunch, belonged to Wayman Church [Wayman Chapel A.M.E. Church, Dayton, Ohio] but she did the cooking and everything and served lunch there at the Y.  And you could go there for lunch so people would go there to eat 'cause you, we didn't eat downtown.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you just couldn't eat downtown (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 1: They, they wouldn't allow you to eat downtown?
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so did, did this, was that true the whole, the whole time that you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And the parents didn't encourage it, they told us where to go.  And we knew to go to the YMCA if you wanted lunch or you had friends in town and wanted to take them to lunch, go to the Y.  Oh, I can't think of her name but she run the Y and the lunch programs, so we always knew to go there.  Then St. Margaret's Church [St. Margaret's Episcopal Church, Dayton, Ohio] was located in the neighborhood.  So they had Wayman Church, they had Zion Baptist [Zion Baptist Church, Dayton, Ohio] and, you know, you could always, if you, if anything happened or you had problems or anything you always were instructed by your parents to either go in the Y because Mr. Waiters [ph.] was I think head of the Y at that time, so if you run into problems or had problems, we knew to go into the YMCA or the drugstore, Cox's Drugstore [Dayton, Ohio] and those places.  And you just always knew where to go.

Speaker 1: Now 5th Street [Dayton, Ohio], I guess, was the, was the business district for, for, for black people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was the business district.
Speaker 1: And I guess and, and then to some extent, 3rd Street was a shopping district, I guess you could go--
Speaker 2: Well, 3rd Street, some of it, yes, 3rd--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Street, West 3rd Street is where they had Rubenstein [Rubenstein's Department Store].  That was a department store on the west side, Rubenstein on 3rd Street is where a lot of people shopped.  And people went downtown, too.  And--
Speaker 1: Where could you shop downtown in those days?
Speaker 2: Oh, you could shop anywhere downtown.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You didn't any problems shopping or going--
Speaker 1: You just--
Speaker 2: --into the store, you just--
Speaker 1: Okay. --had to have money, people didn't have a lot of money during that time.
Speaker 2: What (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, parents that had it, you know, they told you where to go, what time to go, I guess, they looked at sales and so forth, I didn't know, I didn't care really.  'Cause parents would just tell you where you would go to get something.  And Saturday they would go with you.  And the market was there on 3rd Street.
Speaker 2: Right.  They--
Speaker 1: I recall going with my mother [Gussie Bigham Sumlin] to the market on Saturday.
Speaker 2: So this is like an open-air market with fruits and vegetables and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Open-air market, every Saturday.  And I had just started to drive and see my brother [Oliver Sumlin] was in the [U.S. military] service, so he had gone to the service so my mother, I never will forget her coming to the school [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Early College High School, Dayton, Ohio] and they're calling me and I said to my mother, "What are you doing here at school?"  She said, "We got a car sitting out there and I'm too nervous to drive and I come up here to get you enrolled in driving."  I said, "Me?"  (Laughter) She said, "Yes."  So she enrolled me in driving, she said so we can have some transportation.  And she would never drive so she insisted that I drive, so when I started driving she thought that was the greatest thing that ever happened to her.  She said, I said, "Well, Mama, why don't you drive?"  She said, "Oh, honey, mama's just too nervous to drive," and she wouldn't learn to drive.  But when I start, she sure put me in driving, saw to it.  So we always had transportation because she said, "My daughter drives and the only way she can drive is with a permit and I have to sign that permit and she cannot drive unless I'm in the car," which was true, that was the law.  So she insisted that I learn to drive so they put me in driving that day and I've been driving ever since, I think I was in the tenth grade.
Story_ID: 435812
Speaker 1: I wanna go back to when you were a little girl.  What did you like to do with a little girl, as a little girl now, what were your talents and activities and--
Speaker 2: My talent was speaking. They said I was an excellent speaker.  And I wasn't a singer or nothing like that, I was a speaker.  And so I would speak at most of the affairs or I recited Paul Laurence Dunbar.  I had a teacher who loved Paul Laurence Dunbar, Mrs. Probst [ph.].  She was a speech teacher, so a number of us were selected.  I was the commencement speaker, one of the commencement speakers when I finished high school [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Early College High School, Dayton, Ohio].  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  I don't wanna speed past every, you know, grade school.
Story_ID: 435813
Speaker 1: Where did you go to grade school?
Speaker 2: Weaver.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To Weaver.
Speaker 1: Weaver Elementary School [Dayton, Ohio], right?
Speaker 2: Weaver Elementary.
Speaker 1: And did, did you start when you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Up until the eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Did, did you start when you were five or did, or six?
Speaker 2: I started at six.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you didn't have kindergarten?
Speaker 2: Yes, they had kindergarten but I only went a half day.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They only had half-day kindergartens.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is 1931, I guess (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, '31 [1931], '32 [1932].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And was, was, was Weaver a black school then or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Completely white.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were about three black children in that whole school.  And then they separated according to, to districts you see, anything on Home Avenue went to Willard [Willard Elementary School, Dayton, Ohio] and Willard was the black elementary school.  So they had to go on Germantown Street and it was only about the three or four blacks that lived in that neighborhood of Weaver, we went to Weaver School.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did you like it?
Speaker 2: I didn't have any problems.  I went to Weaver all during my elementary, from kindergarten all the way to the eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then my father [Wright Sumlin] said I needed, we needed to learn about black people and to Dunbar [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Early College High School, Dayton, Ohio] we went.  Dunbar was then coming into existence as an elementary, and so we transferred then from Weaver.  When we left Weaver School, instead of going to Roosevelt [Roosevelt High School, Dayton, Ohio] we went to Dunbar.
Story_ID: 435814
Speaker 1: Your favorite teacher at Weaver [Weaver Elementary School, Dayton, Ohio] was Mrs. Angela [ph.]?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Well, well, tell us about her.
Speaker 2: She was my fourth grade teacher and that's the first time I fell in love with a teacher.  And I think she favored me and I favored her.  And we had a good working relationship and that's when I thought about liking school.  And she said, "Well, you're my favorite," she told me one day in the fourth grade. "You're my favorite student," and I liked her from that day (laughter) on.  And I, I liked the school.  We had plenty, plenty of program, excellent programs.  And I think that's where I started my speaking career because of this teacher that encouraged me to read poems and she loved Longfellow [Henry Wadsworth Longfellow] and all she would have us to read every day, Longfellow.  And I got to where I, I really enjoyed Longfellow.  And she was an excellent teacher.  I think that's when I really fell in love with the English language and learning to speak it correctly, words and enunciation and that kind of thing from the fourth grade teacher.  And she thought I was special.  She told me she said at one time, she told us she was Jewish and she took us to the Jewish synagogue and I loved that visit, all of the class went to the Jewish synagogue.
Speaker 1: Which one did they, was it--
Speaker 2: It was the one on Salem Avenue.
Speaker 1: Was that, okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Was it Beth Jacob [Beth Jacob Synagogue, Dayton, Ohio] or Temple Israel [Dayton, Ohio] or which one?
Speaker 2: Temple, no, Temple Israel I don't think was there.
Speaker 1: No, that was, that's right, that's wasn't built yet.
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't even built then.  But when she took us to this Jewish temple on Salem and I never will forget that.  And the rabbi, he came out and she was Jewish, so see that was the first time that we had been exposed to other religions and we had to get permission from our parents and so forth to go, and that was an experience that I never forgot was that fourth grade experience with my teacher at the Jewish synagogue.  And she said, "The Jewish people are, are God's people," and that kind of got us, you know.  So when I got home I was telling my parents [Gussie Bigham Sumlin and Wright Sumlin] and everything about, did you know that?  My father being a Bible person, he said yes, I knew that.  A whole lot of things I know (laughter).  And he started to relate things that he knew from the Bible from our Sunday school class and what have you.  And I took a, a respect for the Jewish people and their religion from that one time visit.  And when I become a teacher I always insisted that our students take field trips, I encouraged that and I would always suggest that they go to the synagogue.  So I learned about that and always appreciated it.
Story_ID: 435815
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a favorite subject at Weaver [Weaver Elementary School, Dayton, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: I think the favorite subject that I had was always English, to find out what they were doing.  I enjoyed our movies and trips to the synagogue, the evenings that we spent in England.  Had a, I had a teacher from Holland [the Netherlands], so we would have movies on Holland, we had the movies of the Netherlands, I had a teacher that was from the Netherlands.  And I enjoyed the exposure.  And we had to dress like those people, I loved that too, during the holidays, the green, the wearing of the green.  They sent you home when I went to school, you know, we'd go home for lunch.  And we would have to dress with the wearing of the green and things like that, so I was into all of that.  The exposure of England since one of my teachers was from England and one was from Holland, and so I had that rich exposure as an elementary student.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your experience at Weaver was a good one (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh, an excellent one.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you were in the eighth, you, you went through the eighth grade at Weaver?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 435816
Speaker 1: --You said your father [Wright Sumlin] wanted to send you to Dunbar [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Early College High School, Dayton, Ohio] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) To Dunbar.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he did, I didn't have a choice.  He told us we were going (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Would you, would you have preferred to go on to Roosevelt [Roosevelt High School, Dayton, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: I would because all my students, all of the students in my class went to Roosevelt.  And he made it very clear to my brother [Oliver Sumlin] and I that we were going to Dunbar and I wouldn't have taken nothing for that experience, that was a rich experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you attended, you started at Dunbar around 1939 is that, is that--
Speaker 2: Somewhere around there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Dunbar High School.  So, now, that's what people, now there's a new Dunbar High School, and it's, it's getting ready to be old, it's old now but (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the old Dunbar became a middle school later on.
Speaker 2: A middle school, that's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but that's, what was Dunbar like?  Was it, how was it different from going to Weaver [Weaver Elementary School, Dayton, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Well, Dunbar was a rich experience for me because I had a rich environment with people of all religions.  And when I got to Dunbar it was all black, that was fine with me.  They had a, a principal there who stressed the importance of being black and why you do certain things and how you enjoy our black history.  It was an all-black school, it was the first school, first all-black school in the State of Ohio, Dunbar when they started it.  And we had the exposure of black teachers, I had never had a black teacher.
Speaker 1: Were, were most of the teachers at Dunbar black or, or all of them?
Speaker 2: All of them were black.
Speaker 1: All.
Speaker 2: They were all white at Weaver.  So I came from an all-white environment to an all-black environment.
Story_ID: 435817
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite teachers at Dunbar [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Early College High School, Dayton, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: All of them were favorite teachers of mine.  I loved them all.  Excellent teachers.  And we were into learning black history for the first time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you actually had courses in black history (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They had courses.  And then--
Speaker 1: Was, who, who was teaching, I'm sorry, black history then?  Was it Mr. Rice or--
Speaker 2: They had Mr. Rice, Mr. Ramie [ph.], and yeah, Mr. Rice and Mr. (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) yeah, Mr. Robert Rice I think was, he was a distant cousin of Dunbar [Paul Laurence Dunbar] right or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I think some of them were.
Speaker 1: Mr. Robert Rice.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, Robert Rice, his father was the sergeant, police man, black police man.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Lucius Rice, yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  His father, he was a, one of them.  Wheeler [George Wheeler] and Rice were the two black police officers on, for the west side.  And they knew everybody.  I never will forget my brother was coming from the movie or a basketball game and he was so surprised because they had had a little ruckus or something and they detained him too, so he knew that he was in trouble, that he was gone get it, so he, he said that when he walked up there and said, Wheeler was the black police sergeant for the west side, so Oliver said they lined them all up against the wall like they were criminals and he said, "What's your name?"  And he said I told him, "I'm Oliver Sumlin."  "You're Oliver Sumlin?  I don't believe it, step out here, boy, and let me look at you (laughter)."  My brother said it made him so nervous he was weak for a week (laughter).  But he said, he said, "I know you, I know your daddy.  Are you Wright Sumlin's son?"  He said, he said, "Yes, I am."  "Number one are you?"  He said, "Yes."  Said, "I have a sister (laughter)."  So out of all of 'em that they lined up, he said, he said to 'em, "He don't cause any trouble, you turn right there and go home.  Tell your daddy I sent you home."  My brother said he ran, he didn't walk home, he said that's the first day he ran (laughter).  He said because that's the first time he had been stopped by a police officer.  And said when he knew him, he said that made it worse.  Daddy said, "I keep telling you," wherever, he said, "Daddy, I didn't believe everybody knew you but I do believe it now (laughter)."  He said--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --when, when he stopped me.  Said and he turned, said and he said, "Who are you?"  Said, "I told him, 'Oliver Sumlin.'"  "You the Sumlin boy, huh?  Come on over here."  He said made him so nervous.  He said but when he told him he could go home, said he didn't walk home, he ran home (laughter) to tell my daddy.  He said, "Daddy there's a police officer that knows you."  He said, "He does?"  Said, "Yeah, said he knows your name, he knows everything about you (laughter)."  My daddy said, "He does?"  And when he found out who he was, he said, "Yes, I know him too, I know his father."  So he said, "Daddy, is there anybody in the city that you don't know?"  (Laughter) But that shocked my brother when he found out that daddy knew the police officer (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Speaker 2: So he didn't have any more trouble.
Story_ID: 435818
Speaker 1: Now, were you involved in, in clubs and activities at Dunbar [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Early College High School, Dayton, Ohio]?  I would suppose you, you would be since--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --you were so well spoken?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So what, what, what were some of the activities that you were involved in, in high school?
Speaker 2: I was in, involved in the drama part of the, of the school and the speaking part, speaking or anything going on like that.  They would call me, they were about eight or nine of us that they marked as speakers for Dunbar, so any time we had to go to other schools or anything like that, we were always marked as one of those people.
Speaker 1: Now, did, did you all have a, a debate team or a forensic team or anything like that?
Speaker 2: They didn't call it the debate team.  I'm trying to think of the name they had for us.
Speaker 1: Was it forensic, was, was it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, something like that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --they had.  And so we were always called upon to go to other schools, you know, to go to other school forums, and that kind of thing.  And we were marked, well, we were marked as one of those speakers for the school.  And, of course, I enjoyed that.
Speaker 1: Now, did you run for class office by any chance?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't one of those who liked to be a class officer or anything like that.  But I would always be, since I was in business, I would always be the secretary and the typist for the programs.  So they would always say, well, "Get Bernice [HistoryMaker Bernice Irene Sumlin] to do the typing and she's a speaker and the principal likes her and she goes in and out of the principal's office (laughter)."  So they would tease me about that all the time.  So the principal did, he knew my father [Wright Sumlin] very well.  And so whenever they had a fair or something like that, my brother [Oliver Sumlin] and I were always called.
Story_ID: 435819
Speaker 1: I know, C.J. McLin was ahead of you, I think, I guess, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was ahead, he was a year ahead of my brother [Oliver Sumlin].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he knew him.  So we knew C.J. from school because his daddy was the funeral director, C.J. McLin, Sr., and he was a political Democrat of the west side.  So C.J., everybody knew C.J.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And his father being the representative, you know, he was the first black elected representative for the State of Ohio from Dayton [Ohio].  So everybody knew C.J.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who else, who, who were some of the other people that, that we might know that were in school with you?
Speaker 2: Bernard Carter [James Bernard Carter], his daddy was the attorney, so we knew Bernard.
Speaker 1: And he became judge, is that the one that became the judge?
Speaker 2: The judge.
Speaker 1: Judge Carter.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Who else?
Speaker 2: Who else?  There was C.J., Bernard Carter, and hm, there were about two or three others, I can't think of 'em.
Speaker 1: Was, was Arthur Fisher [Arthur O. Fisher] there in those days?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Art Fisher was along with C.J., ahead of C.J.--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause he was a little bit older than C.J.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  He became a judge too, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Arthur Fisher.  What about Clarence Bowman [Clarence E. Bowman, Sr.], was he, was he ahead of you?
Speaker 2: The Bowman family, they had one brother but he was ahead of us so we didn't bother with him too much.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, J. Bernard (laughter), they called him J. Bernard.  He would always, he run with us, you know, football games and things like that.  We were all in a group.  So that was (unclear), you know, and Fisher and that was what we used to call the 5th Street gang, so if you lived in that area all the time you were together.  Everybody knew everybody.
Speaker 1: Okay.  5th Street gang.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, you know, well, now, did you, you said you, now, you didn't sing, you said you didn't, you didn't play an instrument either or, did you participate in, in athletic activities, a majorette or anything like that?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who were some of your best friends, I guess, in school then?  I mentioned these other people but I don't know are they, if they were your friends or not?
Speaker 2: I wouldn't say they were friends because I think it was the area in which you lived.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The, they had what was known as the Germantown [Dayton, Ohio] group, we knew that was C.J. McLin was Germantown, you know.  And the Bowman family had some of 5th Street, the Bowmans and we were out of both of those areas because we lived, excuse me, we didn't live in those areas.  So we never participated with any gangs or anything they had going because we were not, we're not Germantown so we couldn't participate with them.  So we were mostly to ourselves so it didn't matter.  The kids never bothered us.
Story_ID: 435820
Speaker 1: When you were a senior in high school [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Early College High School, Dayton, Ohio], what did you wanna be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: Well, I liked going to the Y [Fifth Street YMCA, Dayton, Ohio].  So we could go, Barbara Heard [Barbara Taylor Heard] and I were close friends because we went to school together every day, she lived in the area.  So we did things together and my brother [Oliver Sumlin] was our chaperone (laughter).  And so he had responsibility for Barbara and I.  So Barbara's mother, Mrs. Taylor [Margie Taylor Mason], told us, "Now, if you don't do what he says, then I will take care of you personally."  So he threw that over our heads all the time, if we went to the movie, anywhere I'd go, or basketball games, we could go if he would go.  So he would tell us, "Yes, I'm going, now, when I come down there and look at the area where you all are sitting, I want you to come out of there, don't stay 'til the end because I've got other things to do," he was courting at that time so he wasn't gone let Barbara and I interfere (laughter) with his courting, you know.  So those were the days, so we knew that if he comes down at the end of the football court or wherever we had gone to the game, when he comes down there, he said, "I don't wanna do a whole lot of calling or hollering, when I give you all the sign that means come on now (laughter)."  So we laugh about that to this day, he was our chaperone because he was older, he was a senior, he was then junior and senior year, he didn't wanna be bothered with these seventh and eighth graders.  So daddy [Wright Sumlin] told him, he said, "Now, you're in charge," and he had learned to drive so we could use the car.  And he said, "You will ask daddy if we can use the car and when I come and motion to you and Barbara Jean that means come right then and there," so we got our instructions and things from him.  And so we knew if we wanted to ride and go to the games and everything that we had to do what he said do.  And that was sit in the area where he said we would sit (laughter) and be available when he comes on the scene, to come down there without a whole lot of calling.
Story_ID: 435821
Speaker 1: Tell me now, how did you chose, choose Wilberforce [Combined Normal and Industrial Department at Wilberforce University; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] as a college and why did you, I mean were, were you the first person in your family to go to college?  Did your brother go?
Speaker 2: My brother.  He was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the first one, he went until he went to the [U.S. military] service.
Speaker 1: Did he go to Wilberforce?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  He went to Wilberforce.  He was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the first one to go to Wilberforce.  And--
Speaker 1: So he, he was drafted or something, yeah?
Speaker 2: He was drafted to the service.  So he was in what they called ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] so he didn't have to go in the first batch of fellows that they sent to the service.  But they drafted him on the first call for the colleges.  Oh, my mother [Gussie Bigham Sumlin] was so upset when he got the message that he was gone be sent overseas.  So he went to Okinawa [Okinawa Island, Japan], he was in World War II [WWII].  So they sent him to Okinawa.  And my mother and father [Wright Sumlin], like had a fit.  And I told Oliver [Oliver Sumlin] when he'd write a letter, you know, he'd write me a long letter tell me all the news and (laughter) I'd write him all the news.  So he knew that we had a praying father so I wrote him back in one of the letters, I told him, I said, "Every time daddy goes to the altar," I said, "the only thing he asks to do is to call your name and pray for you and talk about that he doesn't want a scar on your head, he doesn't want this, and he doesn't want that, my only son."  So I wrote all of this in a letter to Oliver.  So he wrote me back, "Tell daddy, keep praying, Oliver (laughter)."  And he says, "I'm getting along fine," but that's what he write, "Tell daddy to keep praying"--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --"Oliver (laughter)."  He wasn't interested in how I was feeling or how anybody else was feeling, you know, he would just write back, "I am doing fine, tell"--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --"daddy keep praying, Oliver."
Speaker 1: So I take it you had a very close relationship with your brother?
Speaker 2: We have a very close relationship, it was only the two of us.  He's the oldest, three years older than I.

Speaker 1: Well, tell us about graduation from Dunbar [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Early College High School, Dayton, Ohio], was there anything special about graduating from Dunbar?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was selected one of the commencement speakers.  And I worked with Mrs. Probst [ph.], who was the speech director.  And I liked to work with the plays.  And so I was in a couple of the high school plays.
Speaker 1: Were, were they plays that we would know the names of 'em now or--
Speaker 2: Shakespeare [William Shakespeare] plays mainly.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What did you play?
Speaker 2: I was trying to think of a--
Speaker 1: Were you in 'Macbeth' [William Shakespeare] or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was in 'Macbeth' I never did, I was so angry with 'Macbeth' (laughter).  And the speech director, oh, she loved 'Macbeth' so we called her Macbeth (laughter) the kids, you know.  We would say, "Well, how is Macbeth feeling today?"  And said, "Oh, she's doing fine, you know."  But she was an excellent speech teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were in 'Macbeth' and so they would do Shakespeare plays at Dunbar?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --they did.
Speaker 1: All right. Well, those are difficult to, you know, do right, you know.

Speaker 1: Do you remember what your commencement speech was about [at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Early College High School, Dayton, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: I kept it for a long time and I've run across it just about a year ago and put it away and forgot where I put it but I still have it.  We were talking, but I forget at that time but I worked with one English teacher for that.  I brought the welcome in, just, oh, my father [Wright Sumlin] was so proud, you could just see him sitting up there, he just beamed away.  I was to bring the welcome address at commencement.  So I told him, I said, "Daddy, I would just get so nervous."  He said, "Well, know that daddy is out there pulling for you and you'll be all right."  Oh, he just give me all kind of encouragement.  But I, I loved my father and mother [Gussie Bigham Sumlin].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very fine people.
Story_ID: 435824
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about Wilberforce [Combined Normal and Industrial Department at Wilberforce University; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  Now, what was Wilberforce like and--
Speaker 2: My father [Wright Sumlin] was a big layman in the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church.  And, of course, Wilberforce is an A.M.E. school.  So we knew (unclear), we knew when we were in high school that we were going to college.  And we knew it was going to be Wilberforce.  I didn't know it was gonna be Wilberforce but my brother did so he being the oldest, he told me, "We are going to Wilberforce and you remember that," (laughter) that we are going to Wilberforce.  And sure enough when he finished, to Wilberforce he went.  And he was there until they drafted him to the service.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Now, Wilberforce is only about, it's about twenty miles from Dayton [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: About twenty miles from--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In Wilberforce, Ohio, near Xenia [Ohio].
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was, it had three thousand students when we went to Wilberforce.  It was, wasn't a little small church school, there were three thousand students at Wilberforce.  And Oliver [Oliver Sumlin] went first, he went, daddy told him that when he was a senior, he said, "Now, you're going to college just remember that and you're going to Wilberforce."  So that was all was said about it.  Daddy had the last word and that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he went and then they sent him, he was drafted into the [U.S.] Army and they sent him to Okinawa [Okinawa Island, Japan], he went to Okinawa and served there two years.  And by that time when he came back I was ready for college and I went to college.
Speaker 1: So did you go directly to Wilberforce out of, after high school [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Early College High School, Dayton, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: So, yeah, okay.  So this is 1944, I guess?
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1944.
Speaker 2: Oliver went in, and my brother went in '42 [1942].  And then I went in '44 [1944].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now the, the president of Wilberforce was--
Speaker 2: Charles Wesley [Charles H. Wesley].
Speaker 1: Yeah, a well-known black historian.
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: And colleague of Carter G. Woodson.
Speaker 2: And that is--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --correct.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So what was he like to you, I mean, how did you, how did you feel about him?
Speaker 2: We admired him.  He was handsome and good looking and everything and girls used to get on the campus and say, "There goes the President Charlie (laughter)."  So we enjoyed that.  So he found out that's what all the girls were saying on campus, you know.  And he got in chapel on a, on a Sunday, on a chapel day and he said, "I am Charlie to this campus," and oh, we just had a fit, you know, we just fell out but he just blended in--
Story_ID: 435825
Speaker 1: We were talking about Dr. Charles Wesley [Charles H. Wesley] and being a very energetic, handsome, president and, you know, a well-known scholar and, you know, so, so you said you worked in, in the office?
Speaker 2: I worked in the president's office.
Speaker 1: President's office, okay.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And your job was to--
Speaker 2: Switchboard operator.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was one of the switchboard operators that they hired my freshmen year and I worked there for the whole time I was at Wilberforce [Combined Normal and Industrial Department at Wilberforce University; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio], for four years, I was one of the switchboard operators.
Speaker 1: Did you enjoy that job?
Speaker 2: I enjoyed it very much.  I was informed with everything that was going on campus and the president would even come in to the area where the switchboard was and I placed personal calls for him and he said they were personal and it's not to go any further than this office.  And I adhered to the rules and I stayed there for four years and enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, now, you were telling us off camera while we were changing tape that some young ladies were asking you to spy on the calls to tell what their boy, who their boyfriends were calling?
Speaker 2: That's right.  They wanted us to, to spy on the calls that were coming from the boys' dormitory to the girls' dormitory.  And, of course, I told 'em, "I'm not gone do that," and I didn't.  And I got along with 'em fine.  But their boyfriends would kind of look at me strangely sometimes, if she's got the information, if she knows it (laughter).  Said, "If I knew it I wouldn't tell it."  And oh, they loved that but it was an enjoyable time.  I knew all the fellows, all the football fellows.  Said, "If you don't do the right thing I can really double cross you (laughter)," and so they would tease me all the time about that but it was enjoyable years.
Story_ID: 435826
Speaker 1: Now, did you know Hallie Q. Brown [Hallie Quinn Brown], I think she was still alive then but I don't know.
Speaker 2: She was alive there for three years of my time at Wilberforce [Combined Normal and Industrial Department at Wilberforce University; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  Yes, she would walk on campus when she was able to walk.  She was well in her nineties, but she would stop sometime and talk with us.  And you would find her a lot of the, a lot of times in the library named Hallie Q. Brown Library [Hallie Q. Brown Memorial Library, Wilberforce, Ohio].  And she'd walk over there and we always enjoyed it when they would present her at, at the time we had our assemblies and she could come.
Speaker 1: Now, she was known during her peak years as a great elocutionist.
Speaker 2: That's what they said.
Speaker 1: And I know she toured Europe and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --as an elocutionist--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --performing for the queen of England [Queen Victoria]--
Speaker 2: That is true.
Speaker 1: --and so forth.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did, did, did you ever hear her give a speech or--
Speaker 2: She had passed that stage where she was doing much speaking when I was at Wilberforce.  She would just, special occasions she would show up on the platform but she didn't do any speaking, she had passed that stage when I got to Wilberforce.
Story_ID: 435827
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other teachers and personalities we might know who were at, at Wilberforce [Combined Normal and Industrial Department at Wilberforce University; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] in those days?
Speaker 2: I was trying to think who you, who you would know.  I'm trying to think who was there with Charles Wesley [Charles H. Wesley].  I think the big thing was after they fired Charles Wesley, you know, I was there two years with him.
Speaker 1: And now what, well, tell us about that.  Now, you were there when the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church--
Speaker 2: Fired him.
Speaker 1: --and Wilberforce split with State of Ohio which (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When they fired him.
Speaker 1: --supported part of the university.
Speaker 2: I was on the switchboard when they fired Wesley.  I was on the switchboard and I saw the switchboard light up and my advisor was, Mrs. Dickerson [ph.].  She was secretary to Mr. Jenkins [ph.], who was on the stateside at that time.  He run the stateside and the information dealing with the governor and that kind of thing.  And when they fired Wesley, I saw the keyboard light up all of a sudden and I said, "That's strange."  So I, I said, "Unh-uh, something's wrong."  So I just stepped to the next office attached to the office and the switchboard was Mrs. Dickerson who was in charge of things so I just got up from the switchboard and said, "Mrs. Dickerson the whole switchboard is lighted and that's unusual, something's happening."  So she said, "I'll take over the switchboard."  So she did.  So I was standing near the switchboard when she let out a loud scream and I said, "Oh, I wonder what's the matter with Miss Dicker?"  She said, "They just fired President Wesley."  And oh, she said, "Just close up that switchboard, just close it up, we don't want any calls going in or out."  And by that time photographers and everything from Dayton [Ohio] and Yellow Springs [Ohio] and Springfield [Ohio] and everything was coming to the campus because they had just gotten the word that Wesley had been fired as president of Wilberforce.  And the meeting was being held in the library so Mrs. Dickerson came in and she took over the switchboard, she says, "Well, I better work the switchboard."  And, of course, she was an adult and secretary and so she said, "You stay here, you can't leave, you'll just have to relieve me at times," but she took over the switchboard.  In a few minutes we looked up photographers and lights and everybody was there, had come from off campus, had just gotten the word, newspaper men, and Dayton Daily News, everything, every Dayton news-, they were coming in from, they flew 'em in from all across the country.  They flew 'em in, all of 'em who could get a plane that lived out of the State of Ohio, who were alumni, and the alumni program was strong, shoot, in less than five minutes I would say there were two hundred people along the campus.  And, of course, by that time our professors were telling us what we could say and what you can't say and you have to make no comments and everybody wanted to know what was going on.  So those were hectic days during those times, during that time.
Story_ID: 435828
Speaker 1: And the, the upshot of it was that Charles Wesley [Charles H. Wesley] became the president of the stateside school which they renamed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He left the church side.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and--
Speaker 2: And walked over on the stateside.  And so he took up office in Bundy Hall and closed down Shorter Hall on the church side, just closed it down.  Of course, we were all out there as students.  I was a sophomore at that time.
Speaker 1: So you made the transition to the state supported side with--
Speaker 2: No, I was already on the stateside.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Because I was in education, and education was on the stateside.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so they just moved the main office from Shorter Hall where Dr. Wesley was, to Bundy Hall and made it the administration office.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I've been told that Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio] kind of regrouped and had to reorganize.
Speaker 2: They stayed at--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --Shorter Hall and Dr. Wesley moved his office and everything to Bundy Hall.
Speaker 1: But both campuses, I mean, both Central State [College of Education and Industrial Arts at Wilberforce; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio], the new Central State University and Wilberforce occupied basically the same space except for just a, it was, it was the same--
Speaker 2: Ravine.
Speaker 1: --yeah, a ravine between the two sides.
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Hm, that is correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And all of the administration, administration became Bundy Hall.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did that affect your education at all or--
Speaker 2: Didn't, didn't bother us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Said the main people, you know, they had to move offices from Shorter Hall over to Bundy Hall.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was just a matter of changing offices and some of the people, the adults that worked there, nothing changed.  We all, everything went on as, as usual.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It didn't bother the students.  We didn't care anyhow.  We got mad with the church, you know, 'cause they were messing with Dr. Wesley, but other than that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --everything went on.
Speaker 1: Did they have a reason, do, do you, is there any reason that you've come to, to understand as to why they fired Dr. Wesley or tried to fire him?
Speaker 2: Well, the trustee board.  See the trustees, church and state run Wilberforce at that time.  And they, the trustee board, they were in the library, Carnegie Library, I never will forget it, they were in Carnegie Library and the lights and everything went on over there and people started running on the campus and everything, said, "They just fired Dr. Wesley, just fired Dr. Wesley."  So Dr. Wesley was in his office and I said to Mrs. Dickerson [ph.] who was my boss, I said, "Did they, did you hear they just fired Dr. Wesley?"  She said, "Yes, that's what," said, "you make no statements from the board, from the switchboard here, just kind of close it down, emergency calls only."  So she said, "You can come back here and sit right here and work, work the boards just--."  Said, "This is an emergency and anybody wanting to know information tell 'em no.  And if it's serious then let me handle it," and that's the way we handled it, um-hm.  Everything went very well.
Story_ID: 435829
Speaker 1: Now you joined AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] your senior year, right?
Speaker 2: My sophomore year.
Speaker 1: Sophomore year, okay.
Speaker 2: I was a sophomore--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when I joined.
Speaker 1: All right.  So how, how many sororities and fraternities were on the Wilberforce campus [Combined Normal and Industrial Department at Wilberforce University; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] then?
Speaker 2: Eight.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were about eight of 'em.
Speaker 1: So you had--
Speaker 2: Fraternities and sororities.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And they were all operating.
Speaker 1: So you had Alpha Kappa Alpha, Kappa Alpha Psi [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity], Omega Psi Phi [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity], Sigma--
Speaker 2: Gamma Rho.
Speaker 1: Sigma Gamma Rho [Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority], Alpha Kappa Alpha, of course, Delta Sigma Theta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Zeta--
Speaker 2: Right.  Phi Beta.
Speaker 1: --Zeta Phi Beta [Zeta Phi Beta Sorority], okay.
Speaker 2: All of, all of those were operating.
Speaker 1: Okay.  These were all the black fraternities and sororities.
Speaker 2: Sororities, they were all operating.
Speaker 1: And what, so, how did you decide to become an AKA?
Speaker 2: Well, I had an aunt and then I had teachers at Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Early College High School, Dayton, Ohio] that were AKAs.  And they had had several affairs with the AKA sorority and they encouraged me and my aunt encouraged me to join.  And my aunt had told me, "You're going to be an AKA so don't even look at the other sororities."  Oh, she was a staunch AKA out of, in California.  So then they had, and her dear friend was Ruth Richardson [ph.], I mean, Richardson, Ruth Dickerson [ph.] and she said to me, "Your aunt wrote me a letter and told me that you were here at Wilberforce," and said, "of course, I know you're going to the AKA affair that they're having on campus."  And then she introduced me to a friend, and we're still friends, Jane [ph.].  And so Mrs. Dickerson told Jane, "You watch every step she makes and you just made AKA and I want you to watch Bernice [HistoryMaker Bernice Irene Sumlin] and don't let her go around with those Deltas."  I said, "Oh, this is terrible (laughter)."  But that's just the way they did it.  And sure enough they had the, a call and the pledge program for AKA so I went to their pledge program [Ivy Leaf Pledge Club] and enjoyed it, enjoyed the performance and everything.  And then there were two girls in my building and they were out and they was from Cleveland, Ohio, and some others and their uncle, her aunt had told her so when the AKAs had their pledge program we went to it.  And so we liked what we saw and they had all this beautiful program and everything.  So I said, my aunt and everybody had told me you don't go around bragging about nothing, said if you're gone go AKA just go AKA and don't say anything to anybody.  And that's exactly what I did, whatever they told me to do is what I did and I never had any trouble.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So this is 1945 you say?
Speaker 2: Forty-four [sic. 1946].
Speaker 1: Forty-four [1944].
Story_ID: 435830
Speaker 1: Now, when you were a senior at, at Central State [College of Education and Industrial Arts at Wilberforce; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] now, right?
Speaker 2: (Nod head).
Speaker 1: What were your career prospects?  Were, were you going, going into teaching directly or?
Speaker 2: At that time I was in the business department.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I had selected my area which was business so I did shorthand, typing, and all of that.  And that was because I had two excellent teachers that was Harrison, Harrison in Dayton, Ohio.  Bill Harrison, William Harrison who was the assistant principal of the Dayton public, of Dunbar [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Early College High School, Dayton, Ohio], and Leo Lucas and I worked with them.
Speaker 1: Now, Leo Lucas had an accounting firm (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That is correct.
Speaker 1: --a black accounting firm, right?
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: And they took me under their wing from the time I was a freshman until I finished high school.  And when I finished high school they wrote letters and for me to go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so when you graduated from college did you go work, did, did you work for Leo Lucas or (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I worked for Leo Lucas during the time I was in college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) For the income tax time.  I knew how to do all of that because I had had him in, in high school and had done the forms, you know, for the, their forms and everything that you do, that 1040 form, tax form, and all of that, so I knew how to do all of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I worked for him a year, for a year after I was out of school, I worked with, with him and for him.  And I, then I decided that I was, it was Bill Harrison that I was at home and they called and said that somebody, yeah, I forget what happened, but anyway, Harrison was moved to assistant principal and when they moved him to assistant principal he went down to the Dayton Board of Education and told 'em he wanted me to take his place in the public school and that's how I got into the public schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you came in teaching business--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --for, okay.
Speaker 2: Came in as the business teacher for Harrison because he was appointed assistant super, principal.  Mr. Richardson [ph.] was moved up to be the principal and they moved Mr. Harrison to be the assistant principal and Mr. Harrison recommended me and that's how I got in the public schools.
Story_ID: 435831
Speaker 1: So how did you like teaching business in, at Dunbar [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Early College High School, Dayton, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: I enjoyed it.  I enjoyed it.  Stayed thirty-five years, stayed thirty-five, never had any, I found out, I told my mother [Gussie Bigham Sumlin], I said, "Mama," I said, "The kids like me."  She said, "They do?"  I said, "Yeah, believe it or not."  I said, "Do you know that those kids like me."  I said, "They don't give me any trouble."  I said, "And they're doing their work."  And she said, I said, they said that I was almost too young coming in 'cause I just came in at twenty.  I was turning twenty-one that November, they hired me October, November, and Mr. Harrison [William Harrison] and them said, "Well, we're gonna take her under our wing."  And Lansdowne [sic. Emerson Landis] was the superintendent and I never will forget how Mr. Harrison told me that I had to go down there 'cause he had to give his final approval.  So when I got down there Mr. Lansdowne, Mr.--I forget who the superintendent was, but anyway he said, "Mr. Harrison speaks of you highly and I'm gonna put you out there with Harrison and Lucas [Leo Lucas]."  And I said, "Fine, I had them when I was at Dunbar."  So he said, "Well, you're awful young to me," he said, "but let me tell you something, I got a daughter that's your age and she's over there at Fairview [Fairview Elementary School, Dayton, Ohio] (laughter).  Now, let me tell you, I'm a tell you like I tell my daughter, I want you to go on in there, I want you to get in there and do what you're supposed to do and do the right thing.  Now, I'm gonna hire my daughter and I'm gone hire you and both of you all are the same age, finished school and everything.  Now, she's going over," I think he said Colonel White [Colonel White High School; Thurgood Marshall High School, Dayton, Ohio] I think is where she went.  So I met her, so she said, "I'm just gonna do what I can do, I am not gone make no out effort to do anything.  What about you?"  I said, "Well, I'm gonna do what I'm supposed to do."  I said, "I'm going out there at Dunbar."  I said, "And they're teachers that taught me, so I don't have any choice."  She said, "You know them?"  I said, "Yeah, I know them."  She said, "They know you?"  I said, "Yes."  She said, "Do you think it's gonna work?"  I said, "I don't know but we'll see."  And so we met up a, a week after that time and she did well and so did I.  So she said, "I think we're gonna make it."  And we were the two teachers that was hired by her father, Lanson [sic.].  And we made it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So you taught at Dunbar for, you taught for a while then you became a school administrator, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I had no excuses or anything.
Speaker 1: Was, was, was it difficult to start teaching so young?
Speaker 2: Well, that's what all of 'em were afraid of.  Mr. Landee, the, Lansdowne, not Lansdowne, Landis was his name.  He said that, "I'm just afraid to hire you at the high school level," said, "because you hadn't even turned twenty-one.  And we hate to bring people at the high school level at such a young age."  He said, "You probably have fellows coming from the [U.S. military] service who will be twenty-one in your class or in the classes of the seniors here at Dunbar, but I'm just going to hire you."  That's what the Lan-, Landis said, the superintendent.  "Well, you're awful young to be going into high school, at the high school level but I'm gonna try you."  Said, "Now I'm gonna tell you, you just gonna be hired temporarily.  And if you don't work out, I'll fire you," is what he said.  He said, "And my daughter too, I'll fire her too (laughter)."
Speaker 1: But everything worked out though (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And he said that so she went her way and I went mine and we both worked out.
Story_ID: 435832
Speaker 1: How did you get involved in, in administration, when, and where?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was years later.  I came into administration as, as an administrator when Mr. Harrison [William Harrison] became superintendent, my teacher that hired me at Dunbar [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Early College High School, Dayton, Ohio] became superintendent of Dayton Public Schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And assistant, he was assistant superintendent, assistant superintendent.  He was assistant superintendent, William Harrison, from Dunbar.
Speaker 1: Now, what, what year is this?
Speaker 2: Oh, Lord, that had to be around forty--'45 [1945], '46 [1946].
Speaker 1: No, it couldn't have been that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --that early, right?
Speaker 2: When was that?
Speaker 1: You know, you may be talking about '65 [1965] or '66 [1966].
Speaker 2: Maybe--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --sixty-five [1965].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Sixty-five [1965].  Harrison was made superintendent, I believe it was superintendent.
Story_ID: 435833
Speaker 1: If I'm not mistaken, Mr. Harrison [William Harrison] got in some trouble.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And--
Speaker 2: He was in trouble, big trouble.
Speaker 1: --and it was very embarrassing for the community (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --because he was well respected, so well respected.
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah, I remember.
Speaker 1: And he was, I think the charge was he was taking equipment or something from the--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah, I remember.
Speaker 1: --public schools [Dayton Public Schools].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, that was, I was then back in the public schools teaching--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at that time when they apprehended him, you know, accused him of taking that, oh, those were hectic days.  And his friend that stood by him was Leo Lucas.  Leo Lucas stood by him all the way.  And since I had worked with both of them, I said to Leo Lucas, "Call me."  I was at home and Mr. Lucas he called and he, and my mother [Gussie Bigham Sumlin] answered the phone, and he said, "I wanna talk to Bernice [HistoryMaker Bernice Irene Sumlin] right away."  So when I answered the phone I said, "Hello."  He said, "I need you."  I said, "Need me?"  He said, "Harrison is in trouble and I need you to do the calling of his, of his brother and to do all the telephoning."  And I said, "How am I gone do--?"  He said, "You just get on the telephone and we eventually will pay you back, but do all of these calling to North Carolina and tell his brother that you're--Leo Lucas has told you to call and tell them that you want him, that Harrison is in trouble and for them to come immediately and give 'em these addresses."  So I give 'em the addresses, Mr. Lucas was gonna pick 'em up.  He said, "I want you to like get here immediately as soon as you can and stay on the phone until they give you a time and then bring me back that, the information."  'Cause he thought that all of the phones most likely would be tapped, you know, they'd tap those phones because he was an administrator, which they did and Mr. Lucas was just ahead of 'em.  And so I called his brother and his sister and they said, "Okay, we're leaving tonight," one was in North Carolina and I think he called, I called his sister somewhere down in Alabama and they said, "Well, tell Mr. Lucas we know that he's a friend of," Bill is what they called Harrison, "Bill Harrison."  And I called them and they come that night.  They said, "Tell 'em we're getting the first thing we can get out of here," the one from North Carolina.  He had a sister I think in South Carolina but there were three of 'em I had to call.  They said, "Tell him we're on our way," and they came to Mr. Harrison's rescue.  They left out of North Carolina, they said, "Tell 'em we're leaving tonight," some come by train.  And I think his brother flew, one was in, in Miami, Florida, somewhere, wherever they were I called 'em and told 'em and they come right on, they didn't waste any time
Speaker 1: So were they able to do any good?  Did they help him out?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  He didn't go to prison (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  He, he came right on and Mr., Mr. Lucas picked him up.  His brother I think flew, his brother, and he told him to come as soon as possible so I think a couple of 'em flew and Mr. Lucas picked them up that night.
Speaker 1: This was about 1969, I believe, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Sixty-nine [1969] or '70 [1970], I think.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.

Speaker 1: Ma'am, tell us about Jim Farmer [James E. Farmer], that's one of your students that, one of your prize students I hear.
Speaker 2: Jim Farmer was an excellent student when I had him in high school [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Early College High School, Dayton, Ohio].  He was from a very noted family, his sister and I went to school together.  And he became a top executive with GMAC [General Motors Acceptance Corporation; Ally Financial Inc.], General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company].  And I think he's retired now, but he was an excellent student.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) yeah, I've heard that he was at one time the head of the Saturn division [Saturn Corporation] and, you know, a vice president of General Motors.
Speaker 2: Yes, that is true.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he honored me by coming to a celebration that they had for me and I was glad to see him.  He was always a fine student.

Speaker 1: Now in 1974 you became the supreme basileus of the national organization of, of Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.], right?
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: And can you tell us about how that happened?  I know you were, you know, just tell us a little bit about that.
Speaker 2: I was asked by a past supreme to run for the national office.  At that time Alpha Kappa Alpha was carrying thirty or forty thousand members.  And I said, oh, I don't know whether I can do that or not but they told me go on and run.  So Larzette Hale [HistoryMaker Larzette Hale-Wilson], the past national president, encouraged me to run.  And she was a CPA [certified public accountant] within her own rights and she was Dr. Hale.  They were formerly from Oklahoma.  And so I did and I won.  And I kind of surprised myself.  And it was one of the most memorable experiences I believe I've ever had in my life.  And I had excellent cooperation the whole four years that I served as international president of Alpha Kappa Alpha.  And I was one of the first supremes out, well, to tell you the truth I was the first supreme out of, I started to say the State of Ohio but that wasn't true because we had L. Pearl [Lottie Pearl Mitchell] up in Cleveland [Ohio] but Dayton, Ohio.  And I have to laugh at myself because when they elected me, everybody said, "We never heard of national presidents coming out of Dayton, Ohio."  I said, "Well, you got one now (laughter)."  And we laughed about that, you know.  I said, "Little old Dayton had a--," so then I told one of my friends I said, "We have established the planes for the United States of America."  I said, "The Wright brothers [Orville Wright and Wilbur Wright] are from Dayton, Ohio."  And they said, "What?"  I said, "The Wright brothers who established the planes that you fly on are from Dayton, Ohio."  And I said, "And that's where I'm from."  They said, "Dayton, Ohio."  I said, "So now you can note that there is great performers from Dayton, Ohio."

Speaker 1: I was served very, very well from all over the United States.  I traveled overseas during my term as international president [supreme basileus] and enjoyed it, went to South Africa during my tenure as national president.
Speaker 2: Now, then that was during apartheid, right?
Speaker 1: It was during that time.  And run into Mandela [Nelson Mandela] in South Africa.  I enjoyed my trip to South Africa.  And, in fact, we had a luncheon at his home, with Mandela.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, this is after apartheid then when he, when you were with him 'cause he wasn't--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess so.
Speaker 2: --released until '91 [sic. 1990], so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So it was after.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yeah.  It was during--
Speaker 1: It was after.
Speaker 2: --it wasn't during your tenure but it was afterwards.
Speaker 1: After the, the tenure of Mandela but I had lunch with him at his home in South Africa when I was there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that was a pleasure (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But it was, it was through association with AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] right, that you--
Speaker 1: Through, right, through AKA.  And that he entertained us at his home in South Africa and it was delightful, just being in his presence we felt elevated.
Story_ID: 435837
Speaker 1: Tell me now, AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.], one of the things, and I think the most memorable thing that you said earlier that you did with AKA was raise money for United Negro College Fund [UNCF].  And you also mentioned supporting the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and the Urban League [National Urban League].  Were, were you close to the NAACP leaders here in Dayton [Ohio], like Miley Williamson [Miley O. Williamson] and--
Speaker 2: I knew Mrs. Williamson from the time I was a young child because she was in charge of the NAACP in Dayton, Ohio.  And I worked with her and her son, she had a son.  And we all were the young people at that time in the NAACP in Dayton.  And, of course, Mrs. Williams, you know, for years was the NAACP of Dayton and she made wonderful contributions.  She opened up the stores, you know, we couldn't go in, I remember when she opened up stores downtown in Dayton, Ohio, we couldn't even go in department stores.  And I remember people sitting, you know, at seats in Woolworths [F.W. Woolworth Company] and so forth, they didn't even permit us to eat or get a sandwich or anything during that time.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: So Miley Williams worked with that.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Now, did, did you go to, to, to, to the March on Washington in '63 [1963]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't go.
Speaker 1: Do you remember W.S. McIntosh [William Sumpter McIntosh]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I remember Mr. McIntosh.  In fact, I taught his children at Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Early College High School, Dayton, Ohio].  I remember when he was shot down up on Germantown Street.  And that was really a shock for the City of Dayton because he was one that encouraged young people to get jobs and to do the right thing.  And it, we were really stunned when we heard Mr. McIntosh had been shot.

Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: As I look back on it, I don't think of anything that I didn't do that I should have done.  I felt that being an asset to the community, I worked with the Dayton Board of Education and I had a wonderful experience there as being the first, at that time they were desegregating schools in the City of Dayton [Ohio].  And at that time I had moved up to administration and I served as, as the administrator for Dayton Public Schools to various programs that they had desegregating schools.  It was an experience for all of us at that time.
Story_ID: 435839
Speaker 1: Did you work with Dr. Charles Glatt in those days?
Speaker 2: Dr. Glatt came and we had that episode with him, you know, and he was shot.  I was, I had just left the office, I hadn't been gone five minutes from the day that he was shot, from the time he was shot, it was five minutes.  We had a, a meeting together, the Dayton Board of Education.  And I had just left him five minutes before he was shot to death.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I never got over that, it was so shocking.
Speaker 1: Now, he was a white man.
Speaker 2: He was a white man.
Speaker 1: Right.  Who was in charge of desegregating the Dayton Public Schools (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he was brought in here to desegregate the schools.  And I worked with him in the various schools and helping to desegregate the schools and that was a shock to all of us.
Speaker 1: And he was shot by a disgruntled white man from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A disgruntled white man.
Speaker 1: --the east side of Dayton [Ohio], I believe, yeah.
Speaker 2: That is true.
Speaker 1: Did, do, do you remember the Model Cities educational initiative under Dr. Arthur E. Thomas?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Dr. Thomas, I knew him through Wilberforce [Combined Normal and Industrial Department at Wilberforce University; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  You know, he was behind me at Wilberforce but I knew him through Wilberforce and through the Dayton Public Schools.  And he was an asset, strong in many ways.  And those were hectic times for desegregation at that time.
Story_ID: 435840
Speaker 1: If you look back on everything you've done do this point again, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think one of the legacies that I would consider would be helping in the desegregation of Dayton Public Schools.  I worked with the superintendent during that time.  And we had hectic times during that time.  I wouldn't consider that as one of my legacies but I will say that I helped work with it.
Story_ID: 435841
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I look at the young people and I'm concerned about their future.  I'm really concerned about young people's future and how they look at it, their outlook on life is altogether different from what I was taught.  But I think they have good intentions, they have excellent intentions.  And I think they can live through this world to project some of those good intentions that they have and I hope they do, because they are saying that all people are created equal and that's the way they look at the world and I think it's a good way to look at it.  It's open, the future is yours, do whatever you would like to do.  But the only thing I hope for them is that they, they find out what their goals are.  The only thing I found with young people is they don't have any goals.  And when I ask 'em, "What is your goal?"  They don't seem to have looked or viewed their goals of what they should be and where they want to be within their future.  That concerns me.  That concerns me that they have not established goals and where they want to be within the next few years.
Speaker 1: Do you think that they kind of cast their fate to the winds, they think that that luck is gonna get 'em to, to next step?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I think that they depend on a whole lot of luck, rather than preparing themselves.  And selecting goals and where they want to be, you have to know where you're going to get there and that is not what I see in young people today.  They have not set the goals of where they would like to be within a certain period of time and that disturbs me.  If you don't know how you're going, how, how you're going, how, how you gonna get there, if you don't know?  And that's important that they find their goal and what they want to do and how to get there.  I find very few young people who have set a goal or even think about how they're gonna get to that goal.

Speaker 1: Tell us about your family.  Now, did, did you ever marry or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --or have children?  Well, I guess, not (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, I didn't have any children.  And I have, was engaged and I decided that that, this wasn't the man and I broke off the engagement and I just decided to go on my own and that's the way it's been.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so your family right now would be, would consist of you and your brother [Oliver Sumlin], I guess, and--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have a brother, I have one brother.
Speaker 1: Now, was, was your, was your, were your parents proud of you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, they've always been proud.  My father [Wright Sumlin] he was proud, he had two children and they came late in life to them because they were married something like twelve, thirteen years before either one of us was born.  And my mother [Gussie Bigham Sumlin] was just so shocked when they told her she [sic.] was born.  And, and, and the two, we've had everything, they give everything to us, my brother and I, we've had everything, we've traveled and we've had the good things of life and we can't, I can't think of anything that we didn't have or where we wanted to go.  He served in, in the [U.S.] Army, so we've had a good life, there's not anything we wanted that we didn't get.  And I think we can say that parents made tremendous sacrifice for us and both of us are college graduates.  And our father, our parents were proud of us. Let me put it like that, they were proud and said so and didn't make any terms.  And we treated them well until their death.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We both supported our parents all the way.
Story_ID: 435843
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything I haven't asked you that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, I can't think of anything that I would like to mention or say that I haven't said.  Been very active with the church all my life.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's with Wayman [Wayman Chapel A.M.E. Church, Dayton, Ohio], right?
Speaker 2: Wayman A.M.E Church.  Oliver [Oliver Sumlin] was born there and, and so was I, I was born at Wayman, both parents [Gussie Bigham Sumlin and Wright Sumlin].  And we were reared in Wayman A.M.E. Church.  And Oliver, Oliver serves as a, a steward in the church.  And I, he serves as a trustee and I serve as a steward in the church.  We've been very faithful to the church and support it 100 percent.
Story_ID: 435844
Speaker 1: Well, my last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I think I would like to be remembered as a person who give to the church and to the community.  I had great experiences through my sorority and have been halfway around the world and have enjoyed the travel of that.  And have worked with Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] and still work with 'em in planning or anything they want me to do, they call me occasionally.  And we will have a boule this year, our hundredth anniversary will be this year in Washington, D.C., and Charlene [Charlene Truitt-Nelson] and I plan to go (laughter).  And so we're in the process of getting our reservations and everything ready for Washington for our hundredth anniversary, so we're planning to have a good time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: It's been a pleasure to meet you and, and I thank you very much.
Speaker 1: All right.
