Speaker 2: Do you know her birth date?
Speaker 1: November 13, '40 [1940], '50 [1950], '60 [1960], '70 [1970], so that's '70 [1970], '60 [1960], '50 [1950], '40 [1940], I wanna say 1942 or something like that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: She's seventy-six now.

Speaker 1: So somewhere in the '40s [1940s]. I guess--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) forty-two [1942] or something like that.
Speaker 2: What did she do?
Speaker 1: My mother started off, well she's a singer. My mother is a singer. You said what did she do?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) See.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: That's your question.
Speaker 1: She's a singer but she, she's, my mother worked in, for the city. She had several jobs, you know, she was a word processor. Her, her, her clerical skills were like out of this world. And she worked for different, different, I wanna say units, different governments or mayors that we were fortunate enough to have in Newark. So she worked in city hall [Newark City Hall, Newark, New Jersey]. After her stint at city hall she then went to Office of Administrative Law [New Jersey Office of Administrative Law]. But all throughout this time she was very prominent and active in the church, in, in Newark, New Jersey.
Speaker 2: What church (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All churches.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: From Life Tabernacle [Life Tabernacle Church of God in Christ, Newark, New Jersey] to New Point Baptist Church [Newark, New Jersey] to, you know, you know, the names, Greater Abyssinian [Greater Abyssinian Baptist Church, Newark, New Jersey], everything (laughter).
Speaker 2: As a singer?
Speaker 1: As a singer.
Speaker 2: So was she hired as a singer?
Speaker 1: She was hired as a singer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: She sang, she was singing in many different groups, The Alvin Darling Ensemble, to be, one that would be more notable. And--
Speaker 2: And, and was that gospel music?
Speaker 1: This is gospel music. She then began--as far as I know, she may have been doing it earlier, but her, her, her jazz and, I guess, blues singing came into place, I think, later on. I think it was the gospel music first and, and throughout the churches. And then she would then go on to perform with several different groups under the direction of a great contributor, Rudy Stevenson. And she--the, the group consist of people like, I call these women now my aunt, but I say like Aunt Brenda, Brenda Mitchell, Jean Cheek, Tina Fabrique, Arlene Graham [ph.]. I don't know that they had a name for the group, I don't remember that. But then they would sing and they still sing together to this day.
Speaker 2: Did they practice at home, in your home?
Speaker 1: No, they didn't practice in our home or our unit at the time. They would practice in, in, in, in Queens [New York] and wherever Rudy was--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --was stationed, they would go to his apartment. But my mother was always singing in the house, we were always singing, everyone. We sang in the car on the way to where we were going, we sang back, we--
Speaker 2: What were you singing?
Speaker 1: Just anything, mainly church songs (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --and hymns and whatnot. But then every now and then we would just make up songs, you know.
Story_ID: 666188
Speaker 1: Your mother's [Yvette Glover] from Newark [New Jersey], where are her parents from?
Speaker 2: My mother's parents are from Virginia, I believe. My grandmother, Madame Anna Lundy Lewis, and then my mother's father who was Bill Lewis, Wilbert, hence her middle name Wilbertine, Wilbert Lewis, I don't know where he was born.
Speaker 1: Did they live in Virginia?
Speaker 2: They lived in Virginia for a while.
Speaker 1: Do you know what part?
Speaker 2: Newport News [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then we have Jacksonville, like Florida, my, my family is extended, the extended version of our family is down there, but mainly Virginia. And I wanna say now also like throughout the Carolinas, you know, South Carolina and whatnot. And then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And do you know what their work was as you go backwards in your family?
Speaker 2: My--musicians. My, my, my, my grandfather was a musician and a great cook actually. My grandfather worked with the likes of like, he had a long run with Jerry Lewis. He would then claim his notoriety in the Catskills [Catskill Mountains].
Speaker 1: Oh, sure.
Speaker 2: He was a pianist as was my grandmother, Anna Lundy Lewis, Madame Anna Lundy Lewis. My grandmother traveled playing for the, what do they call it, USO [United Service Organizations]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: The [U.S. military] service.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was, I mean, she did that.
Speaker 1: During World War II [WWII]?
Speaker 2: I believe so. I know that she, she didn't slow down until I was like maybe seven or eight-ish. All up to that point she had been traveling and performing. And we, there was a, a lady that I have to mention when we talk about my family; Barr, Annie Barr [ph.] and George Barr [ph.]. They had, I don't wanna say an orphanage but it was a home where they would take care of kids. And Barr took care of my mother because my grandmother was not around. So I was born thinking that Barr and George Barr, who we called Poppel [ph.], Barr and Poppel were our grandparents. But I love them so much, I love Barr and Sarah [ph.] and--
Speaker 1: Are they still living?
Speaker 2: No, they're not. Sorry.
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: But they took care of so many of us. And we would have these, you know, the holidays, Thanksgiving, and so many people would come to Barr's house. And this, it was sort of like how my family, like how, I wanna say this is how I began to know about people who were not immediately related but family, the sense of family. Not--again not necessarily related but just a sense of family and communion. You know, I, I, in, in our culture, in, in the, in the, in the black homes, we wind up calling everybody auntie and uncle and that's my cousin and whatnot like that. So I had a lot of aunts and uncles who I did not know, I wouldn't meet until we had these Thanksgiving dinners and whatnot at, at Barr's house. Barr, Poppel and Sarah. So my mother was raised by Barr and Poppel because my grandmother, Anna Lundy Lewis, was traveling and performing as was Bill Lewis, my grandfather.
Speaker 1: And did they travel together?
Speaker 2: No, no, they did not.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: They separated early.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They separated early but continued to, you know, continued to perform--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --individually (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And--
Story_ID: 666189
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your mother's family?
Speaker 2: I am not, I don't wanna say I'm not into it, I haven't even began to--I know, you know, I know, of course, my grandmother [Anna Lundy Lewis], my grandfather [Wilbert Lewis] and then Dick Lundy, my great-grandfather (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, so your great-grandfather, Dick Lundy, who was a baseball player.
Speaker 2: He was a baseball player, he was one of the greatest. Started off with the Newark Eagles, Dick Lundy. I think he was like one of the first managers of, of the team, of the Negro League team, of one of the Negro League teams, which I'm very proud of--
Speaker 1: Of course.
Speaker 2: --to know that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And he was one of the, well, lauded as one of the four greatest shortstops in Negro League history.
Speaker 2: This is correct. Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the team that he managed and played on were the Bacharach Giants?
Speaker 2: Bacharach Giants (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is that it? I think that was one of 'em anyway.
Speaker 2: Huh.
Speaker 1: So what--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --do you know about him as a player?
Speaker 2: All I know is what I've heard and that is that he was amongst the top in his position. And he had these, I guess, managerial skills that allowed him at that time to be sought after, or sort of one of the more intellectuals of that era. So that's basically all I know.
Speaker 1: Right. 'Cause he passed away before you were born?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But he, he was born in 1898.
Speaker 2: Hm.
Speaker 1: Amazing. Do, did, did your mother [Yvette Glover] have stories of him when--
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did she know of him?
Speaker 2: I don't, I'm sure she knew him but no, there were not many stories about Dick Lundy in our home. We just knew that he was a baseball player, you know, for the, for the Negro League.
Speaker 1: And he also went to college, he went Edward Waters College.
Speaker 2: Hm.
Speaker 1: Which is in Jacksonville [Florida], the oldest historically black college [HBCU] in Florida.
Speaker 2: Wow. This is great.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's, so that's your great-grandfather.
Speaker 2: That's my great-grandfather.
Speaker 1: On your mother's side.
Story_ID: 666190
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father, what's his name and where's he from?
Speaker 2: My father, I think they, I think they created a song--he was responsible, I think, for the song 'Papa Was A Rolling Stone.'
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: I think, they had him in mind (laughter) when--no. As far as I know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --my father, Mitchell Wilson [sic. Willie Mitchell], born and raised in Chicago [Illinois], I believe. And, you know, I have never, even though I didn't grow up, you know, with my father, I, I have the vivid memories of the four times that I remember seeing him in my life. And my grandmother, his mother, Mittie Wilson, lived in Newark [New Jersey] in the Weequahic section of Newark. So I would always go to her home and my sister on my father's side, Debra [ph.], I would see her there every so often. But I went to, I went to Grandma Mittie's house a lot just to hang out with them and spend the night over there. So I know like my aunts and uncles on that side fairly well, but my father was not there. He came to that house on Weequahic Avenue one time when I was, I don't know, I can't even remember, maybe I was--I, I base everything on before I started tap dancing, so I started tap dancing when I was seven, so I try to remember everything that happened before I was seven. So he, I, maybe I saw him for the first time that I can remember when I was like (clears throat) maybe five, I wasn't even tap dancing yet. And that first memory I remember him saying that he was gonna buy me a set of drums. And then I didn't see him again until, until I was on, we were, we were promoting the movie 'Tap' and we were in Chicago and my mother [Yvette Glover] said, "Do you wanna see your father?" I said, "Yeah." So I saw him there.
Speaker 1: And how old were you then?
Speaker 2: I was fourteen.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I was around fourteen years old then. I saw him then, I saw him there, it was very awkward, but Gregory Hines played a tremendous role. I remember that day, I remember that day, Gregory, Gregory was so happy to meet my father. He made me feel like this was one of the greatest moments of my life. I don't know how he did that, but he, his energy and the words that he said to me prior to me seeing my father was just like, "Well, yeah, this is something I wanna do." I never had any animosity or any, I always loved my father. I loved him and cared for him as if he was raising me in the home, but I just never saw him. So, and then I saw him that time and then--so three times I saw him actually that I can remember. The last time I saw him I was, again, in Chicago on tour. We were doing, what? I don't know if it was 'Jelly's Last Jam' [George C. Wolfe] on tour or 'Noise Funk,' I wanna say 'Noise Funk,' 'Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk' [Reg E. Gaines], so this was--no, it couldn't have been in the, in 2000, it had to be 'Jelly's Last Jam.' It was 'Jelly's Last Jam' 'cause it was, it was the '90s [1990s]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --still when I was out there and saw him. And that was the last time I saw him. The next thing I know he was, he had passed away.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I don't know, I know that he was a carpenter and a great dancer, that's how he and my mother met. Just like club dancing, you know, social skills. And--
Speaker 1: So he died very young?
Speaker 2: He died young, yeah. I mean, he, he had to be, I'm forty-three, he had to be in his--my mother, he had to be in his like late fifties I wanna say, maybe early sixties.
Speaker 1: Do you know why he died?
Speaker 2: The song. I think the song got to him (laughter). No, I, I think he was murdered--
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: --by a woman. So, yeah (laughter). I believe, that's the story.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 666191
Speaker 1: You knew your grandma Mittie [Mittie Wilson]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your father's [Willie Mitchell] family?
Speaker 2: Not far at all.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: Not far at all. Just my, my grandma Mittie and her husband, John Wilson [ph.].
Speaker 1: And what did they do?
Speaker 2: I don't know. I don't know. I know that John worked on those cars--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --I mean, religiously. He, he worked on those cars every time--all the time I was over there. He had these huge hands and it looked like he just soaked his hands in what do they call that stuff? Like the car grease--
Speaker 1: Gro- grease, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and whatnot.	He was just, you know, and then he would just come in the house and watch the game and chill out. I don't know what my grandmother's line of work was. You know what? She worked at Bamberger's [L. Bamberger and Company].
Speaker 1: The clothing store?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Department store.
Speaker 2: Yeah. But I don't know, was she a waitress there? I don't know. (Pause) Yeah, I don't know.
Speaker 1: And when you would go over to her house, what would you do?
Speaker 2: I would play in the yard. You know, at, at that time I, I didn't, when we were young, when I was young, you made friends with, you know, you had these imaginary friends so (laughter) I was the only kid in the house. It was my grandma--it was Grandma Mittie, Grandpa John, and then Kim [Kim Sharif], my, another daughter would be up, upstairs, and Lance [Lance Wilson] would be there from time to time, Dwight [Dwight Wilson] would be there, these are all my uncles (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) These are Mittie's--
Speaker 2: These are Mittie's children. But I wouldn't play with them. As far as my, I can recollect I would either be in the yard playing, you know, I was doing gymnastics at a very early age so I would be out there. I wasn't allowed to like venture, walk up and down the block. Excuse me, they had a picket fence, so I would stay inside of the parameters there and just have fun. I did, we did a lot of talking with my grandmother.
Speaker 1: What did you talk about?
Speaker 2: Everything. We spoke about school, we spoke about traveling, we spoke about what was on TV. She was very--just talked. I remember just having conversations. Even though I'm not, I wasn't, I probably at the time taking it all in but I remember my grandmother--and it wasn't like I would get tired of her talking, it was that inspiring, I would just listen and she went, if she went into the kitchen and cooked something I would go into the kitchen and sit at the table and just be there around her. I did that with Barr [Annie Barr (ph.)] as well. Just go in the kitchen and be around, just listen to them talk. They'd watch 'The Price is Right,' I'd watch 'The Price is Right.'
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You know, we'd, you know, whatever, whatever was going on in the house. These were some of the more safe and clean environments, there was no alcohol, you know, there was not a lot, there was, maybe Grandpa John said damn every now and then (laughter), but there was no profanity. I, I grew up, my, my, my innocence, I, I was able to maintain that, I think, because of my family and the people who were around me, you know. They, they knew, they knew my mother [Yvette Glover] wasn't having that so I think, (clears throat) I think our, my, myself and my two brothers, I think our environments, wherever we went the environment knew not to contaminate us in any way. You don't say any foul language, you don't bring any alcohol, you don't do anything around my children except for pray and sing or do something respectful, you know, what I mean. Yeah, that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Are you the youngest of your mother's children?
Speaker 2: I am the youngest, yeah.
Speaker 1: Who are your siblings?
Speaker 2: My siblings are Carlton Glover who is the oldest, we're, we're all two years apart, and then the middle one, Abron [Abron Glover]. So it's myself, Savion [HistoryMaker Savion Glover], Carlton, and Abron.
Speaker 1: And did you grow up with them?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we all grew up together. Again, now if I wasn't at my grandmother's house, Mittie, then we were all at Barr's.
Speaker 1: Okay. When your mom was working?
Speaker 2: When my mother was working.
Story_ID: 666192
Speaker 1: Or we were at home because at that time when I was like--again, my [maternal] grandmother, Madame Anna Lundy Lewis, was home more. Like, again, prior to my birth she did a lot of her traveling and whatnot.
Speaker 2: And it, it--included in her performance I see that she, she was a church organist at Whitney Houston's church [New Hope Baptist Church, Newark, New Jersey]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, my mother--my grandmother, [HistoryMaker] Dionne Warwick--my grandmother like taught a lot of people that we know how to either sing or play the piano. Her relationship with Cissy [HistoryMaker Cissy Houston] would still be strong if she hadn't passed away. Yeah, my grandmother like, she was sort of the real deal. I, I remember asking my grandmother (laughter) one time, I said, "Nana, do you know like Thelonious Monk?" Or, or I said like, "Did you, did you ever play with like, people like Thelonious Monk or did you know him?" She said, "You better ask him if he know me" (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I said dang. Ooh, man. But my grandmother she was, you know, a minister of music. And she would, again, after her, I wanna say deeds or service, or duty to the service, she would then establish her presence in the, in the churches throughout Newark [New Jersey] and throughout, I guess, all around the country. My grandmother was eccentric. You know, she was grand.
Story_ID: 666193
Speaker 1: My [maternal] grandmother [Anna Lundy Lewis] had a house on Farley Avenue [Newark, New Jersey], around the corner from Barr [Annie Barr (ph.)]. So we lived--and so when, when, so first we grew up on Rose Terrace in the, in the apartment, in the same house as Barr and Poppel [George Barr (ph.)]. We grew, we, we lived on the first floor, Barr and Poppel were on the second floor, and all, everybody happened on the second floor and the third floor. So then once we moved from there we moved maybe ten blocks down the hill to Livingston Street. My grandmother still had a room in the house, my mother [Yvette Glover] would, so my mother would have to be on the couch to accommodate my grandmother. To this day I don't understand that concept but that's what it is. And that carried on when we moved down the hill to Livingston Street. We were, it was a townhouse, you know, the first townhouses which were not, you know, it was, they were projects, people brought these things in on the truck and boom, boom, boom. We had three rooms upstairs, myself, my two older brothers, my mother, my grandmother. And then another friend of the family or aunt, Aunt Arlene [Arlene Graham (ph.)], and her child. We all lived in this unit, three bedrooms (laughter). My mother would, again, give my grandmother the largest room in the townhouse. I shared a room with Abron [Abron Glover] and then I shared a room with Carlton [Carlton Glover] and then I slept with--my mother shared the room with Carlton, she just slept in there. I slept with my mother in that bed or I would sleep on some clothes in Abron's (laughter) bed. And I'm saying all this to say meanwhile, my grandmother had a house on Farley Avenue.
Speaker 2: Where she didn't stay?
Speaker 1: It was for her hats. My grandmother had a house (laughter), my grandmother had a house--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --full of hats, Harriette [HistoryMaker Harriette Cole].
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Excuse me.
Speaker 2: For her church--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --church, the church hats; right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: Performance hats?
Speaker 1: Her hats, I mean, it was a home. You walk in the home and there were just boxes. She paid rent for her hats (laughter). And would, and would stay with us though. I--we, we'd get evicted, we couldn't pay the bill, the, they would cut off the lights or lock us out, we'd come home from vacation, we'd pull up, all of us, me and my brothers, Aunt Arlene, my, my mother, her child, six of us pull up in a Nova [Chevrolet Nova], my grandmother would be on the porch with the dog, "Nana, what's, what's up?" "Well, they locked us out." Meanwhile she has a home (laughter) and I mean she has money too, my grandmother's best friend was Doris Duke.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So at any given time, (laughter) you know, she had about five thousand dollars in the attache case, easily. She'd be sitting on that porch--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --with the dog saying, "You know, praise all mighty God, they locked us out. We didn't have no lights, Mr. Williams [ph.] came," and boom, boom, boom. "Told me to get out, I have to get out." She could have bought the whole town, all twenty of the townhouses (laughter), she could have went to her home, she could have gotten a hotel, she could have called Doris Duke to send a helicopter for her (laughter), but she chose to, and this was, this would happen, you know, if the lights would go out, we couldn't, you know, my grandmother would not budge.
Story_ID: 666194
Speaker 1: You mentioned the people who were living in the house with you.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Your--none of your siblings' fathers lived with you?
Speaker 2: No. No, none of, none of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Di- did you know any of them?
Speaker 2: I knew Abron's [Abron Glover] father, Teak [ph.]. And I didn't know Charles [ph.], I didn't know my oldest brother's--I didn't know Carlton's father. Teak would come around. And, you know, he was the most visible out of all, out of all of our fathers. My mother [Yvette Glover] would, I, I remember sometimes like when we would be downtown or in the downtown area of Newark [New Jersey] my mother would say, "There goes Carlton's father," or, "There goes Charles." And I don't know if she was playing or not (laughter), but I remember her saying like, "That's, there goes Charles," you know. But I, we didn't, we didn't know him. I think, you know, my mother tried to get Carlton [Carlton Glover] to go visit, but Carlton was a little reluctant to do so. So, no, the only one who was--
Speaker 1: Was Teak?
Speaker 2: I mean, and when he did come around, it was Teak.
Speaker 1: So did you, did you miss not having a father in your home?
Speaker 2: Not at all.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Right, now I, I can, I can honestly say that I did not miss not having a father because we had so much, we had nothing but yet we had so much. We had love from everyone who came into our humble abode (laughter). And we had things to do. My mother kept us occupied. You would have thought like, you know, we were like Ricky Schroder or something, you know, what I mean. It was like we, we, we were in, you know, we were in, in, you know, music school. Always traveling to New York [New York] or to Queens [New York] or to--always traveling. Not, you know, to get on a plane to travel but going somewhere. You know, my mother would take us downtown and we would race, my mother would like race us in the alley, you know. Going to movies. Just doing things. She kept us occupied.

Speaker 1: If you go back in your childhood, go back to as far back as you can remember, what would you say is your earliest memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory of just--
Speaker 1: Ever.
Speaker 2: Woo, my earliest memory ever. My gosh. I remember Sheba [ph.]--I remember being at Barr's [Annie Barr (ph.)] house. I remember walking around, I, for some reason I was always like, ta da, like, you know, bearing myself, which makes sense because my child [Chaney Glover] is doing that now.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I remember Sheba. (Pause) Well now I remember before that. I remember Uncle Dennis [ph.], I don't know that I should tell this. I remember, my uncle Dennis was a big guy, and he would sit on the porch, to this day I don't know if that was a real uncle or not. He would sit on the porch and I would sit on the porch with Uncle Dennis and sing. And I was told even though the environment was like that--like I mentioned earlier, I was told that I would sometimes have beer in my baby bottle because my mother [Yvette Glover] was, she loved beer, Miller Lite. And--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --I would sit on that porch and Dennis would, he'd be singing and sipping a beer and I'd be there with my bottle, baby bottle, so I remember that. I remember sitting on the porch with Dennis. I remember we had like, you know, Afros and these, we would sometimes wear like dashikis and stuff, you know, you know. That's it. I remember that dog, I remember Sheba.
Speaker 1: What was Sheba?
Speaker 2: Sheba was Barr's dog.
Speaker 1: What kind of dog?
Speaker 2: I don't know, it was, you know, you remember Lassie?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: It was that kind of dog.
Speaker 1: A collie.
Speaker 2: A collie. It was a huge dog too. At the time I mean, I was five--I don't, I don't even know what age I was like four or something. But I remember like riding her, I remember being able to ride Sheba around Barr's house. And--
Speaker 1: And, and Sheba was your [maternal] grandmother's [Anna Lundy Lewis] dog or Barr's dog?
Speaker 2: Barr's dog.
Speaker 1: Barr's dog.
Speaker 2: This was, yeah, Sheba--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was Barr's dog. Our dog was Fitch [ph.], the meanest dog--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --ever (laughter).
Speaker 1: What type of dog?
Speaker 2: He was just a dirty dog. (Laughter) He was just a dirty street dog. I don't even, Fitch was--did you see that movie the, the last 'Planet of the Apes' ['Dawn of the Planet of the Apes']? That the one, what's this guy's name?
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Koba, was that the, is that the character's name, Koba (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I can't remember.
Speaker 2: But just, it's the ugly one.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: That's how Fitch looked. Fitch wouldn't even let us in the house. We had to trick Fitch.
Speaker 1: Into your house?
Speaker 2: Into our house, into our--we had to tease him at the door while Abron [Glover's brother, Abron Glover] snuck around, climbed through the window and like (gesture), then he would distract Fitch and then we would be able to get in. And then once we got in, Fitch would, I guess, calm down. But he would like, he was just angry. Fitch was angry. Yeah (laughter).

Speaker 1: Still in your childhood, what are the sights, sounds, and smells that you remember?
Speaker 2: Hm. I remember music, I remember gospel music, gospel music. You know, myself, my brother, we would, we would practice, we didn't have drums but we would prac- we would use a chair to practice on and I would use my knee as my bass, my knee would be my bass drum. And always good food. Always good food. I remember, excuse me. I remember having as a young child so much meatloaf with that red sauce, knockwurst with, with sauerkraut. My favorite meal as a youngster was knockwurst and noodles, buttered noodles. Yeah, and I, I remember just love, I remember just love. Again, you know, even when we got in trouble it wasn't, it didn't last long because it was like, "All right we did that, maybe--." I don't remember being on punishment like for a week. You know, I don't, I remember getting a whooping, you know, (laughter) to make you know, "You don't need to be, you don't need a punishment, you just gonna get this whooping and then we'll see how you react tomorrow, you can go outside, play, do what you need to do." But punishment--now I remember Abron [Abron Glover] being on punishment, my middle brother (laughter).
Speaker 1: What, what, why was he on punishment?
Speaker 2: Oh, you name it (laughter). Abron was the first one to curse in the house, you know, (laughter) you know, he was, Abron was, Abron was the first to do everything in the house, you know (laughter). So, you know, Abron and his mouth was, he'd, you know, say--he'd talk back and do all this stuff, you know, so he was the rebel, he was the first rebel in the house.
Speaker 1: So, you grew up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in Newark [New Jersey]. You, you were born not long after the riots--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in Newark, which really devastated the city for a long time.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was, I mean, you've described love and family and connection very beautifully, but surrounding you was a, a city that was crumbling.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What, was that something that you could see, were you, did you--
Speaker 2: Not at all. I had no clue of what was really happening in Newark because we were a part of the happenings. I mean, we knew that there was murder and crime and whatnot, you know, I, again, there is no--now maybe there's a good part of Newark but it, it wasn't no good part of Newark (laughter), you know.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Right, because it had fallen apart.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Newark, you know, it, it was just crazy. But--
Speaker 1: But did you feel endangered?
Speaker 2: Not at all. I felt safe. Everywhere we went people knew who we were. And we, it's not, not by being famous or, or, or, or in showbiz or anything it was just people knew my mother [Yvette Glover], they knew my [maternal] grandmother [Anna Lundy Lewis]. Again, when you mention ri- I didn't even learn about that until later, you know, I'm in my early twenties to even--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --acknowledge that my city could have been a part of that, you know. We, it was just, I wanna, I wanna say it was beautiful, you know, it was beautiful.
Story_ID: 666197
Speaker 1: Where did you start going to school?
Speaker 2: My first school was Avon Avenue School [BRICK Avon Academy], right in Newark [New Jersey] on, on Avon Avenue, Avon and Bergen [Street]. I went there for kindergarten, Miss Lipsy [ph.]. And then Queen of Angels [Queen of Angels School, Newark, New Jersey], first--until I started tap dancing, from first grade until I was--
Speaker 1: Well, that was not long I mean you started (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was not long, I, I went--
Speaker 1: --tap dancing right away.
Speaker 2: --yeah, I went to, I started tap dancing when I was seven. I went to Queen of Angels, we all went to Queen of Angels, my brother [Carlton Glover] graduated from there. I don't know if, I think Abron [Abron Glover] left like seventh grade or something like that and went to Calvary Christian [Calvary Christian School, Newark, New Jersey] and then on to other schools.
Speaker 1: Were these Catholic schools?
Speaker 2: This, this, Queen of Angels was a, was a Catholic school. We all went--
Speaker 1: And so you, you just moments ago describe sometimes not having enough money for rent and Catholic school costs money?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. And we sometimes--not had enough money for tuition as well. Grandmother [Glover's maternal grandmother, Anna Lundy Lewis] still sitting on a five thousand [dollars] (laughter)--not moving. But, you know, things would happen. I remember, I remember--and to this day we don't know, we, I think, at, our pastor at the time did it. But tuition was due, my mother sent us to school anyway. It, my mother had that rapport with the people, it was, you know, back then, you can, "All right, Miss Glover [Yvette Glover], we'll, we'll take 'em" (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And how was she earning a living at this point?
Speaker 2: She was still at Office of Administrative Law [New Jersey Office of Administrative Law].
Speaker 1: Still, still doing that?
Speaker 2: Still, yeah, still--
Speaker 1: So she was working?
Speaker 2: She was working.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But she has three children and sending them to private school alone, no father, no help, only help from friends and this is not monetary help, this is just love and support.
Speaker 1: Which is important.
Speaker 2: Which is what mainly got us through. So I, one time the tuition was due, she sent us to school anyway, came home, we got a call, Miss Moses [ph.] called my mother and said, "Thank you, we, we received the tuition, everything is good." To this day we don't know who paid that tuition. I thought at the time that it was the pastor of the church, I thought it was Bert Baker at the time. But to this day we don't know who paid that tuition.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Yep. And then after that I went on to school in New York [New York] (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 666198
Speaker 1: You began tap lessons at age seven?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: This is in eigh- 1980?
Speaker 2: Is that when it was, when I was seven (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think, I think--
Speaker 2: (Mumbles).
Speaker 1: I think, '80 [1980], '81 [1981].
Speaker 2: Yep, '80 [1980].
Speaker 1: Was it in Newark [New Jersey] where you started taking these classes?
Speaker 2: No, I started taking classes in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: How did you know that you wanted to tap? What, what--
Speaker 2: I did not know. I, I, again, I'm, I'm, I'm, so I joined this band, Rudy Stevenson's kids and myself we had a, we, Rudy formulated this band, Three Plus. We were playing all around the tri-state.
Speaker 1: And what were you playing?
Speaker 2: I was playing the drums.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I was playing the drums (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So that practice that you had done--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at home turned into (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, we had went to Newark Community School of the Arts [Newark School of the Arts, Newark, New Jersey]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for drum lessons--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and theory, you know, learning music.
Speaker 1: As a very young child?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I mean, I don't, I don't even remember at what, I, I, all I remember is being at the school. So if I started tap dancing when I was seven (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Age four.
Speaker 2: It was at, was that four when I went there?
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 2: My gosh, so I went there. We all went there and, and, and took--
Speaker 1: And you took Suzuki classes; right?
Speaker 2: I took Suzuki, drum lessons, and theory.
Speaker 1: And I have it here that you were the youngest student in the school's history to receive a full scholarship to that school (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: When you were four?
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: So, so, so I'm in this band and we're playing and we played at this benefit for Benny Clorey and that benefit was at Hines and Hatchett dance school [Hines-Hatchett; Broadway Dance Center, New York, New York] and that day would change my life. I remember sitting behind this drum, the drum was bigger than me, and it was that day where my mother [Yvette Glover] signed us up. I say us because if she could have she would have signed the whole neighborhood up (laughter) to have us doing something. She signed us up; myself, my two older brothers [Carlton Glover and Abron Glover], like Terry [ph.] and Alicia [ph.], whoever was with us, Daiton [ph.], whoever was with us at the time--
Speaker 1: That's who got signed up.
Speaker 2: That's who got signed up for tap classes. And from that day on--
Speaker 1: And this is in Manhattan [New York]?
Speaker 2: This is in Manhattan.
Speaker 1: So this is no, I mean, even though Manhattan and Newark are not far away from each other, you're a little kid (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no, this is a journey.
Speaker 1: This is a journey--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and how are you getting there?
Speaker 2: We, I, I love it, the journey itself I always say was better than the, the, the tap classes. We'd get up, still living in Newark, maybe every once in a while we would catch a cab to Penn Station, but most of the time we caught that 70 bus down to Newark Penn Station [Pennsylvania Station, Newark, New Jersey], caught the PATH [Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation] train over to 34th Street, this is when the PATH train was like fifty cents.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The bus, I paid maybe seventy-five, maybe, at my age you paid fifty cents, my mother paid maybe seventy-five cents, a dollar, for an adult. PATH train (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And this--when did you go? On Saturdays?
Speaker 2: We went on Saturdays.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This, this was our, this was our Saturday mornings. And we would be singing and dancing and doing stuff in the streets on the way. We got on the bus, we playing find the word. You know, we got on the train, we're playing find the word and singing and doing stuff. We walked from then, from New York Penn Station [Pennsylvania Station, New York, New York] up to 55th Street; laughing, joking, playing around, doing stuff. We get to, to the class, I think we had to be there maybe twelve o'clock or something like that, and we'd be there all day, what would seem like all day but maybe it was like from twelve to three or something like that. And then we'd make that journey back home; walk back down to Penn Station New York, get on that PATH, Penn Station Newark, catch that 70 bus.
Speaker 1: And your mother is with you?
Speaker 2: My mother was with us (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your mother is the, the adult in the group and it's all these kids?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Story_ID: 666199
Speaker 1: And is it tap or is it tap and other things?
Speaker 2: It's only, I only took tap dancing.
Speaker 1: And what about your brothers [Carlton Glover and Abron Glover]?
Speaker 2: Tap dancing, we all--
Speaker 1: Everybody took tap?
Speaker 2: Our first classes were tap dance classes, yes.
Speaker 1: And, and where, what was the name of this school?
Speaker 2: The name of the school at the time was called Hines and Hatchett--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --dance school [Hines-Hatchett, New York, New York], which is now the Broadway Dance Center.
Speaker 1: But this was a school that was owned by Gregory Hines?
Speaker 2: It was owned by--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --Gregory and Frank Hatchett (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Frank Hatchett.
Speaker 2: Gregory Hines and Frank Hatchett. I think both Maurice [HistoryMaker Maurice Hines, Jr.] and Gregory--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --had some ownership in, in, in the school but yeah, Frank Hatchett and Gregory Hines. At the time I didn't, you know, I didn't know Gregory. All, all I knew is that we'd sometimes see this Afro looking over the, the thing into the classes, just another dude.
Speaker 1: You didn't know who he was, right?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh (shakes head).
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Yvette Glover] know?
Speaker 2: Not that she would tell us. I'm sure she knew but we didn't know. It was just a--
Speaker 1: And when you first--
Speaker 2: --dude (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) went I read that, that you, you did not have tap shoes at first.
Speaker 2: No, we didn't. My first, I had three quarter cowboy boots. I loved some cowboy boots, my mother kept me in some cowboy boots. So, yeah, we put, later on we would put taps on those boots, but no we could not, we couldn't afford tap shoes, we could barely afford Thom McAn shoes (laughter). So, yeah, my first pair of tap shoes were my boots and my brother would, my brothers would, you know, eventually they would use their hard bottoms but they started off in their sneakers, you know.
Speaker 1: And they let you at the school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They let us.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they let us do it.
Speaker 1: They didn't require that you have the tap shoes yet?
Speaker 2: No, again, there was like there were certain provisions, like my mother, it, it was like, "Y'all go ahead, y'all, you can, you can do that." Everybody wasn't on, you know, you should--it was required, yes it was, to have tap shoes but for a long time we were in there, regular just hard bottoms and, and sneakers.
Story_ID: 666200
Speaker 1: As you are learning tap, you're seven years old, when, when do you feel it in your body that this, this is for me? This is--
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't even understand that concept until, until I'm, until I meet these men. Until I meet Jimmy Slyde and Gregory Hines and, and Lon Chaney, and--until I meet these wonderful men and more fascinating contributors to the arts. I'm seven years old, I'm nine years old, even at ten when I'm on Broadway doing 'Tap Dance Kid' ['The Tap Dance Kid,' Charles Blackwell], it's just something to do (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you, so, so back up. When you were at Hines-Hatchett [Broadway Dance Center, New York, New York], you see the Afro but you don't meet him then?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You don't meet him while you're at this school?
Speaker 2: I don't meet him at, at that school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And then how, how were you selected to perform in 'Tap Dance Kid'? This is '83 [1983].
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, again, average day at the school, at Hines and Hatchett. Frank Hatchett, who had took to me at a, at, early on, who would later be my godfather, become my godfather. Frank, what I remember, Frank told my mother [Yvette Glover], "There's some people coming up from a Broadway show and I want to recommend Savion [HistoryMaker Savion Glover] to go in there and audition." And I went in there, sang some of the songs that we had been singing on the train (laughter), and like, you know, I did--I tap danced as I knew it at the time, and I did my gymnastics that was taught to me by Bone, my cousin, Tony [ph.]. And that was it, it was, it was Frank who, who, who set it up. I went in there, I did the thing and the next--I don't know if it was the next week, but like a short time after that they called me in again for what would be a callback and then I was, I read the side, I read the script, I read a scene with them.
Speaker 1: And you had never done anything like this before?
Speaker 2: Not at all. So I'm in there like, all right. I mean, I know how to read (laughter) so let me--acting, I didn't, I was just being me, you know, I didn't know what that was.
Speaker 1: And in church, had you performed at all in church? Had you sung in the choir?
Speaker 2: I didn't sing in the choir. We would play air (gesture)--like when it, when it got (makes sounds), you know, when it, when it got busy in the church, in the, they shouting and doing all the stuff, I remember myself and a childhood friend would get up and start acting as if we were playing the stuff, you know. But I didn't, I didn't, I didn't sing in the choir until like later at, at, at bible fellowship, that's, you know, when I'm like fifteen or, you know, fourteen or something like that. But prior to that, no, I didn't sing in the choir. Again, I had taken drum lessons so I knew that, but I didn't, I, acting, I didn't do any of that, you know, these were just--
Speaker 1: But you had been (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) god given.
Speaker 1: --performing with your family just--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --sat--playing around?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: You had confidence?
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely, definitely. I was confident enough that I can do whatever. I, my mother, in--she gave us the sense that we could do anything, we could do anything. I could have been, and still can be anything because of my mother. My mother, and not only her own children, my mother would have you believing (laughter) and feeling as if you can do it. So whatever I was going into that room for I knew that--
Speaker 1: And you were not, were you not nervous?
Speaker 2: Not at all. Again, these were just things to do. Everything up until--again like when I star- up until the point that I realize what the dance was and is to me now, everything just seemed like it was something to do.
Story_ID: 666201
Speaker 1: Broadway, 'Tap Dance Kid' ['The Tap Dance Kid,' Charles Blackwell], I don't know anything about being a celebrity. Hinton Battle, they'd cover they faces and sneak out the stage door. They push me out there so that they can (laughter) sneak away, not sign a--I'm signing papers, signing autographs. Limousines outside, we got the Nova [Chevrolet Nova] (laughter), Aunt Arlene [Arlene Graham (ph.)] is out there, Daiton [ph.] is out there, we got the Nova. It's right there, dark brown, broken down, in the middle of these stretch limousines (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: We get in the car. I can remember sometimes getting halfway through the Lincoln Tunnel and the car breaking down, just finishing a Broadway show. I can remember sometimes going in to New York [New York], (laughter) once Aunt Arlene came into our house and she had a car, we started--
Speaker 2: The Nova was her car?
Speaker 1: The Nova was Aunt Arlene's car.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: My mother [Yvette Glover] didn't have a car. We didn't have a car until like later on.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Aunt, when, when Aunt Arlene moved in to the townhouse with her son--real quick, Aunt Arlene came over for dinner, end of story, she wound up living with us for--
Speaker 2: And Aunt Arlene is related to whom?
Speaker 1: Who? The church (laughter). Again, Aunt Arlene is related to the church. But she moved in with us, her and Daiton, and we, again, Daiton was in those tap classes with us [at Hines-Hatchett; Broadway Dance Center, New York, New York]. Going back to that townhouse, so aunt, we had a pullout couch that became Aunt Arlene's bed. My mother would then give up the living room to accommodate Arlene and Daiton, her child. So we, it's tight in my house (laughter).
Speaker 2: Was it ever stressful?
Speaker 1: I mean, we were a black family, so we had our moments. But again it, it, we would, even being evicted and not having lights, even in our moments when we had to light candles, in the moments where our home was broken into and we knew the person who did it, even in these, the most turmoil of moments we, we kept going, we kept going, you know, no fear of--
Speaker 2: But you kept going and you were happy.
Speaker 1: We were satisfied. We were happy. I was a very happy boy. Joyful, joy, I don't remember not laughing, (laughter) you know, or being silly, you know, just being a young boy. I remember being reprimanded and, and, and disciplined, of course, but I remember fun and love, you know. So, again, being on Broadway at ten years old, again, was just something to do, you're the tap dance kid, that don't matter, you're going home, you, you gonna play football or, back to the village with your homies in the parking lot, you know. My friends didn't--you know, I wasn't going back home, "Oh, I'm the tap dancer." You're playing basketball and doing everyday activities, you know.
Story_ID: 666202
Speaker 1: I wanna talk a bit more about 'The Tap Dance Kid' [Charles Blackwell].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You describe how, you know, it, it, it's fun, it's something that you're doing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You're also performing for huge audiences. It's, is it eight shows a week?
Speaker 2: Eight shows a week, yep.
Speaker 1: For how long?
Speaker 2: I did 'The Tap Dance Kid' for, for, I was, I was an understudy, excuse me, and I did the role for about a year and a half. I, I was the, I was the last installment. So I, I, I was, again, an understudy for about a year or so maybe, maybe eight months or something like that--I'm not sure it was for--it wasn't a full year but I did the role for about a year and a half.
Speaker 1: And so you're now, I mean, you describe it as fun but everybody who's talked about Broadway, eight shows a week, it's work too.
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: Did it not feel like that to you?
Speaker 2: Not at all. Not at all. I, it, everything about it, it was like, I started, you know, the transition started so now I have, I'm going to a different school, I didn't go to school for a year because they didn't know where to place me.
Speaker 1: Because you were so young?
Speaker 2: Well because I was starting this show business, so I, I left Queen of Angels [Queen of Angels School, Newark, New Jersey] at the beginning of my sixth grade school year, and I didn't go to school when the, when the regular kids started because I had started this 'Tap Dance Kid,' I started the show. So we searched around, searched around, searched around for schools. No one would accept me because I would be missing certain days, I had these matinees and I would, you know, I'm doing morning shows and I would not be in school a lot, so the system wouldn't have that in Newark [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: And there was no professional children's school in Newark?
Speaker 2: Not in Newark.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: No. So I wound up going to Professional Children's School in New York [New York] on 60th Street. Which was, I, I just, you know, I'm going to school and I see like, I see people that I see on TV in the school, (laughter) like what the heck is going on. So I, it was a weird environment for me and I explained that to my mother [Yvette Glover], so I, I think I went to PCS for like one year, or half a year, something like that, which was again that sixth grade--
Speaker 1: And meanwhile you're not, it, it, it's not occurring to you when they see you they're seeing the same thing?
Speaker 2: No. I'm thinking, why am I here (laughter)? Why is this, hey, I'm a, I'm a kid from Newark. Now I have a chaperone, you know, now a car comes to pick me up every day, you know, and I'm going to school in New York with [HistoryMaker] Malcolm-Jamal Warner and Ricky Schroder and Tempestt [Tempestt Bledsoe]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and, and I'm like, whoa. It was psycho- it was weird to me.
Story_ID: 666203
Speaker 1: And then I went up to East Harlem [New York, New York] where I felt more like this is my groove here.
Speaker 2: And what school did you find there?
Speaker 1: East Harlem Performing Arts [East Harlem Performing Arts School, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Which would then turn into Jose Feliciano--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --School [Jose Feliciano Performing Arts School; P.S. 50, Vito Marcantonio School]. But this was on 101st Street and 1st Avenue. I would sometimes stay with Frank Hatchett on 92nd Street in his apartment. Excuse me, walk over to, to school. So it's like, between 'Tap Dance Kid' ['The Tap Dance Kid,' Charles Blackwell]--'Tap Dance Kid' which was PCS [Professional Children's School, New York, New York] and then I move on--so now I'm in show business, I guess (laughter). So I'm doing things, I'm doing print work, I'm doing, you know, I'm auditioning but still it's fun. I'm, the reason why I probably, I don't have or wasn't an early childhood sitcom guy because I'm in the auditions joking. I'm, okay, I'm going to read this side, but I don't have any acting classes or acting skills at the time. And the environment was weird. You know, I'm sitting in these hallways with my mother [Yvette Glover] and I'm, we're doing crosswords puzzles or little, playing games and whatnot, little travel, travel checkers. These other kids are like (makes sounds), like it was, you know, warming up and the mother is like, "Okay, now when you go in you (makes sounds)." And we, our, we're down at the end of the hall, like our situation is different. So it was just kind of weird for me.
Speaker 2: Well, you're saying weird but then in terms of that whole audition process where a lot of kids as well as adults, it's traumatic, because often they're rejected or they feel judged. You, you didn't have that experience?
Speaker 1: (Shakes head) No. I, I didn't feel, I, I wanna, I can say, I think I can say, I was, when I was auditioning I was going in like, "What am I--why," (laughter), "what is this (makes sound) TV show, I ain't gonna be on no TV show" (laughter). So, you know, I'm, I'm looking forward to getting back home and like playing football or something, you know, or getting out of this audition so we can have fun, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And so did you, were you selected for any of these auditions?
Speaker 1: Not at all.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Not at all. Again, that's why I tell you like, you, I wasn't, you know, I didn't do any, you know, early commercials and, and things like that, you know. TV, even though I was going on the auditions, I guess, I wasn't, you know, I didn't get the audition obviously, but my TV appearances (unclear) didn't happen until later, until I think I became known, which allowed me to do a, a special commercial like I remember the very first commercial I did was like a, when we had that New York save the water drought. And I remember my skit, "New York, there's no sidestepping our water shortage. An open hydrant can waste millions of gallons but together we can get over it." That was my first piece of script, aside from 'Tap Dance Kid,' that was my first commercial.
Speaker 2: And about when did that occur?
Speaker 1: Man, I, it has to be like '80s [1980s], mid-'80s [1980s]. I wanna say like in the midst of 'Tap Dance Kid.'
Speaker 2: So 'Tap Dance Kid' was '83 [1983] to '85 [1985]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was, it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So around that time?
Speaker 1: --so that commercial, yeah, definitely, definitely.

Speaker 1: While you are living in this experience, you know, you're getting a ton of media coverage, I mean, you're proclaimed nationally, if not internationally as a prodigy.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Are you aware of this?
Speaker 2: I'm aware of what they're saying, but I haven't owned it.
Speaker 1: Okay. And you're also making money so is it, is, is, are, are you aware of that?
Speaker 2: I'm aware that I'm making money, but I wasn't making the money.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That was my mother's [Yvette Glover], like we, we did that.
Speaker 1: Right. I, I got it.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But so did it change your, your home, did it change your--
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: --you know, did, because were, was it then now easier, the bills are getting paid, did life get any different at home?
Speaker 2: No (laughter). Nothing, nothing changed. I mean, the only thing that changed was like I was able to maybe--Christmastime, now I had, I had a little money in my pocket so I can buy people gifts now, you know. But nothing really changed, we still lived in that townhouse [in Newark, New Jersey], we didn't move until like later.
Speaker 1: Okay. So your life did not substantially change, in your awareness anyhow, as a result of 'Tap Dance Kid' ['The Tap Dance Kid,' Charles Blackwell]?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Other than you now know that you are a professional in the entertainment world?
Speaker 2: I don't even know that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I just know that I'm performing in this show.
Speaker 1: Got it.
Speaker 2: I don't know the, I don't know the magnitude of what I'm doing. I just know I'm tap dancing in this show.
Speaker 1: And then a couple, a couple years pass--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --so you're still going to professional school while you're auditioning and things aren't necessarily clicking (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, then I went up to East Harlem Performing Arts [East Harlem Performing Arts School; P.S. 50, Vito Marcantonio School, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So after, after East Harlem Performing Arts, which I went up until ninth grade, then I came back to Newark [New Jersey] and I would finish my education at Arts High School in Newark (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. And what did you study at Arts High School?
Speaker 2: I went there for drama.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was a drama major. So it's essentially--so in, in Professional Children's School [New York, New York] we did drama, art--drama, and, well, mainly drama. East Harlem Performing Arts we did drama, art, dance, everybody had to do everything, not unless you were like, you know, in the choir or whatever. Well, we did drama, everybody had drama class, dance class, and art.
Speaker 1: And were you still taking tap independently?
Speaker 2: No, I stopped taking tap classes after 'Tap Dance Kid.'
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: I stopped taking classes.
Story_ID: 666205
Speaker 1: Now at what point do you meet the, the men who you say really shaped your life?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, so I meet them after 'Tap Dance Kid' ['The Tap Dance Kid,' Charles Blackwell]. Well, you know, I met Lon Chaney that day, that first day where my mother [Yvette Glover] signed us up [at Hines-Hatchett; Broadway Dance Center, New York, New York]. And the story is, or I followed him into this room, into the locker room, I guess, I was excited or impressed at what I had seen him do, which was tap dance like I had never witnessed before in my life, him and Chuck Green. And I followed him into the room. He said some things to me, you know, "Hey, man, man you need to dance and to translate that stuff you're doing on the drums to your feet," and blah, blah, blah. I remember that. And years later I would meet him again in that room.
Speaker 1: This was at the benefit where you met him?
Speaker 2: Where I first him was at the benefit (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear), where you were playing the drums and he tells you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --put that in your feet.
Speaker 2: He said, "Translate that."
Speaker 1: Translate that.
Speaker 2: He said, "You just need," he said, "young man, you should translate that to your feet," those were his exact words to me. I'm like seven years old and I remember those moments. And I do 'Tap Dance Kid.' So then years later, 'Black and Blue.'
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: 'Black and Blue' is when I met (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's 1989.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's, that's--
Speaker 1: So 'Black and Blue' is a Broadway musical revue, right?
Speaker 2: Well, the first 'Black and Blue' we did in Paris [France].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was the, we, we, I did, I did 'Black and Blue' in Paris and I was in Paris for like twelve- like a year with these men.
Speaker 1: And which men, tell me who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Lon Chaney, Buster Brown [James "Buster" Brown], Jimmy Slyde, George Hillman, Bernard Manners, Ivery Wheeler, Jan Mickens, Melvin Washington, Tanya Gibson, Kyme Hersi [Kyme Hersi-Sallid], Valerie, Michael Clorey [ph.], the brother of Benny Clorey, who we were doing the benefit for.
Speaker 1: Right. Because the, because--
Speaker 2: Benny had, had been paralyzed.
Speaker 1: Right. Had he gotten paralyzed while dancing?
Speaker 2: He, the story is he was in a hotel room--a hotel hallway doing gymnastics and had an, had an accident. Yeah. So and, and I think about this now like things just kept coming around in my life.
Speaker 1: So his brother was a dancer as well?
Speaker 2: His brother, they were, they were the Clorey brothers.
Speaker 1: Right. Okay. Got it.
Speaker 2: Benny and Michael Clorey. So I'm in Paris and, and Bunny Briggs, whose wife is Olivette Miller [Olivette Miller Briggs]. Ruth Brown, Linda Hopkins. The band, Sir Roland Hanna, Rudy Stevenson (laughter), Grady Tate on the drums, Jerome Richardson (gesture).
Speaker 1: And were you aware of any of these people before (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not at all (laughter). That's what I'm saying.
Speaker 1: So you meet them all in Paris. First of all, you're going to Paris--
Speaker 2: I'm going to Paris (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who goes with you?
Speaker 2: My mother.
Speaker 1: Okay. So your mother at this point she's your chaperone?
Speaker 2: Oh, my mother was my momager.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Momager.
Speaker 2: My mother becomes my momager (laughter). My mother becomes my momager after 'Tap Dance Kid,' after 'Tap Dance Kid.' Yeah. So when I met these men, when I met these people it's like I didn't understand who they were but it was who they were. I didn't understand their popularity, their, their, they were famous and doing all of this stuff, but they were some of the nicest men and women ever. This was my introduction to like, oh, my gosh, this is show business, this is show business. 'Tap Dance Kid' wasn't, that it wasn't deep to me (laughter). When I got around these people, these tap dancers, people like Jimmy Slyde, Dianne Walker, it was then when I began to understand the dance, it was then when I began to understand why I do this. And I just fell in love, I fell in love with them first, I fell in love with Jimmy Slyde, I fell in love with Lon Chaney, I fell in love with George Hillman, I fell in love with Henry LeTang. I loved them as men, as human beings. They were the coolest cats on the planet. To this day I have not met men like them.
Story_ID: 666206
Speaker 1: And they were performing in 'Black and Blue,' which is a musical revue celebrating black culture?
Speaker 2: This is true.
Speaker 1: So it's historic?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, the, the, the messaging?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the messaging is historic. And again, 'Tap Dance Kid' ['The Tap Dance Kid,' Charles Blackwell] was like a carnival compared to everything that I've done after that. Everything that I've been involved in is like serious (laughter) work, you know. It speaks--it's work that speaks to me. I'm so thankful to God that I, my environment as far as show business or performing, it's been real, it's been real. And what I mean by that is the shows that I've been in, they've been shows that tell my story, they tell my story, they talk about my ancestors, we, we, their history, you know. And I'm very thankful and grateful to the men and women who have invited me, you know, these, these cats invited me in and there was no front, Lon Chaney did everything, Jimmy Slyde did everything. Jimmy Slyde took, bought me my first leather jacket in Paris [France]. He bought me my first, what do you call it now, beret?
Speaker 1: A beret.
Speaker 2: Little tammy thing.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You know. And--
Speaker 1: And in terms of your craft--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --because I've read when you've talked about 'Tap Dance Kid,' you know, you, you learn the basics is how you described it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: By the time you get to 'Black and Blue' this is a few years later, you're sixteen years old, you're in Paris with all of these great people including great dancers.
Speaker 2: Well, again, Paris and, and, and--I'm sorry, 'Black and Blue' in Paris I was like twelve or thirteen.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: For 'Black and Blue' Broadway--
Speaker 1: Was sixteen.
Speaker 2: --it was sixteen.
Speaker 1: Okay. So this is not long after then?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. You're about twelve then. So--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What, what are they teaching you about your craft?
Speaker 2: They are teaching me how to express myself. They're teaching me not how to tap dance but how to tell a story. They're teaching me how to make music. They're teaching me how to express myself through this dance. They're teaching me what, they're teaching me the power of the dance, the power of expression. They're teaching me how to tell my story through dance. They're teaching me how to hear tap dance, not the visual, it's not a visual, they're teaching me how to hear it. And changed my life.
Story_ID: 666207
Speaker 1: Well, and as you describe that, you know, it sounds a bit esoteric, so--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --how, how, how did, as it was said to you, translate what you're doing on those drums into your feet.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This is the same, this is, this is what you're learning to do?
Speaker 2: Yes. Precisely.
Speaker 1: And how, what is your process like?
Speaker 2: My process is like, they, I was, I was called early on like a sponge, that I can steal steps early and duplicate 'em and do this stuff. So I'm, I leave the (makes sounds), I leave this Broadway or--I really can't even say Broadway style, I leave a, a particular style, which had a limited vocabulary. You got shuffle, flap, cramp roll, pull back, spank, hop, cramp roll. Now I'm dealing with (makes sounds), how do you say that? How do you do, I need you to say (makes sounds), or (makes sounds), and you gotta figure out that vocabulary. How do you get bam? Is, is it--no, that ain't bam, that's boop (laughter). So you gotta figure out, you know, I'm figuring out how to articulate what I want to say through my feet, you know. I'm learning from them, I'm watching them, I'm imitating some, but I was always doing my own thing because they encouraged that. They'll show me a little bit or whatever, but they say, "Now do something with it." (Snaps fingers) I'd come back, ten minutes. I said, "All right, is this it?" They say (makes sounds) (laughter). "Do it," boom. Then they say, "Go, go show Buster [James "Buster" Brown]," say, "ask Buster."
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I say, "Is this it?" "Yeah, that's all right." You, you, you know, never, they, I never remember receiving, "Yeah, that's it," until later, thirty-five maybe, thirty-two years old, twenty-eight.
Speaker 1: And so what, what you were receiving is encouragement?
Speaker 2: Only encouragement. Keep going is what they were teaching me. It ain't, it, (makes sounds) it ain't right yet (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And are--
Story_ID: 666208
Speaker 1: Are you figuring out how to interpret these different sounds, as you just described, because the music is changing, like what's happening in, in terms--you know, in, in, in the pantheon of tappers--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the music changes generation to generation. Obviously at a certain point you become pivotal in that changing, but in these early days as you're kind of figuring it out, like 'Black and Blue' is set in the past.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But you're still looking for the translation in your feet of--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --of what's coming forth. How--is it, is it as the music is changing, is it just you as yourself interpreting the existing music, what, what are you working with?
Speaker 2: Swing. We were, it was swinging (snaps fingers). If it, if it wasn't swinging--because we were encouraged to swing while you danced, Jimmy Slyde and them said, "You know, if ain't swinging you ain't, you ain't dancing." So the music, even though I was listening to, you know, Beastie Boys or Run-DMC, well, I--the music that I chose to tap dance to at the time was (snaps fingers) 'A Train' ['Take the "A" Train'], Duke Ellington, Count Basie, you know, Q [HistoryMaker Quincy Jones], (makes sounds) you know, 'Sentimental Mood' ['In a Sentimental Mood'], because--and, and, what I, what I wanna also say is like I was learning how to speak and articulate these things through my feet, but I felt like I needed to tell their story, not their story but I felt like I needed to tell the story about them. I am, maybe, you know, 'Noise, Funk' ['Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk,' Reg E. Gaines] is when I began to--
Speaker 1: Tell your story (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) tell my story through my, through my feet. But up until that point--
Speaker 1: And that's what year?
Speaker 2: 'Noise, Funk' was '96 [1996].
Speaker 1: So this is many years before that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That, that--well, you're, you're still a child at this point.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You're, so you're, but your awareness is that you're looking to tell, tell the story of that time?
Speaker 2: I'm looking to, I'm looking to represent for these men. I'm looking to represent, which in turn allow me to believe that I'm representing for my ancestors, like I have to represent, like we have to represent. So I couldn't even begin to talk about myself or acknowledge myself. It, it was upsetting. I would, I would get angry that I can be somewhere and people would say, "Aren't you [HistoryMaker] Savion Glover?" But I say, "This is Jimmy Slyde." I didn't understand that. So I would get upset and I would be, I mean, go on missions to make sure that people knew these men. You know, even, you know, with it, it--I, I remember like doing a, a show traveling and I had to tell this producer, "I am not on this plane in first class and Jimmy Slyde is back here in coach. You gotta fix that" (laughter). You know. So these things were propelling me to want to, again, represent for them, which then allowed my relationship with them to be more personal, you know. I learnt, and people always say, "Oh, well, did they teach you a lot of stuff?" I learnt a lot of stuff on the phone or at dinner, most of my lessons were away from the dance floor. So then it's like how do you translate that story, that lesson that you learnt through conversation, now go talk about that through your feet, express that.
Story_ID: 666209
Speaker 1: And so as you are bridging that gap from what you're learning intellectually in this feeding of your soul from these men and you're translating it to your feet, what are you doing? Are you, are you meditating, are you praying, are you just dancing, you're just moving, what are you doing?
Speaker 2: What am, what am I doing--
Speaker 1: To, to, to do the translation?
Speaker 2: I'm just dancing. I, I'm (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You're just dancing.
Speaker 2: --it's, it's like a out of body experience. I'm just tap dancing. Meditating, I didn't begin to meditate until--you know. But I'm speaking, I'm speaking through this dance, I'm speaking, I'm having conversations with the dance. The audience doesn't exist, you know. I'm thinking about these men. I'm thinking about how to bring these pictures to voice, which is really through dance. So I'm speaking about my [maternal] grandmother [Anna Lundy Lewis], I'm speaking about my mother [Yvette Glover], I'm speaking about my father [Willie Mitchell], I'm speaking about my brothers [Carlton Glover and Abron Glover], my friends, I'm--everything, everything that I am, whenever I manifest to be whatever I'm gonna be, is gonna come out through my dance. Whatever I am at whichever time in my life, that's what my dance is going to be. So at, in the beginning, (snaps fingers) I'm swinging, telling that story. And then as I get older I realize I'm a black man living in America and, you know, people are watching you, things are happening, can't get a cab, you're different, (laughter) you know. This comes out in my dance. I get more aggressive. I don't, I'm no killer, I'm not gonna, you know, go start, join a gang and, you know (laughter). So I, I express this through my dance, so my dance becomes a--more aggressive. Now I've got Redman in my mind (laughter) and like Public Enemy, and, you know, X Clan and, you know, N.W.A. [Niggaz Wit Attitudes] (laughter), so my dance is be- getting a little different.
Story_ID: 666210
Speaker 1: Back to these men for a moment.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You are working with them during your formative years. You're--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you're a teenager, growing up (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Everything I, after 'Tap Dance Kid' ['The Tap Dance Kid,' Charles Blackwell], everything I did was with them.
Speaker 1: So even though you didn't have your father [Willie Mitchell] in your life you now have these men?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: And they're also teaching you how to be a man?
Speaker 2: Everything. Everything. These men became everything to me. God is, (laughter) these men became everything to me. They became my fathers, they became my grandfathers, they became my brothers, they became my friends, my mentors, my teachers, they became everything to me. (Pause) I cannot, aside from my mother [Yvette Glover], I am not what I am if they are not in my life. If Jimmy Slyde, if I don't know a Jimmy Slyde, (sighs) if I don't, if I don't know a Lon Chaney or a Bunny Briggs or a George Hillman, I don't know what I would do, what I would be, where I would be. They became everything for me. George Hillman was the first to pass along, to transition. And again, that is when, I met George Hillman, he was eighty-one (laughter). I think he died like maybe, maybe he passed when he was like ninety-two or something like that, ninety-five, I'm, I'm not sure. But his passing it affected me. It was like a, like a wakeup call, it was like--it, it, his passing allowed me to realize how much I loved these men.
Speaker 1: And did you stay in touch with them after you were no longer working with them?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. They, they became your family?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --without a doubt.
Story_ID: 666211
Speaker 1: And so when you, you were in Paris [France] you--then, then the production of 'Black and Blue' comes to--
Speaker 2: And then we come to Broadway.
Speaker 1: --Broadway.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: A few years later?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How was it received?
Speaker 2: Very well. Very well. Still star studded cast. 'Black and Blue' was received very well on Broadway. Hector [Hector Orezzoli] and Claudio [Claudio Segovia], are the producers.
Speaker 1: Well, and you're coming back from--so you spent time in Paris?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It's completely different in every way from New York [New York], well, there's some similarities but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it's a very different experience.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Different experience for a black man. Coming back to New York, to America, what was that experience like for you?
Speaker 2: Again, back home (laughter) going to play basketball or football or do something (laughter). Do you remember People's airlines [People Express Airlines]?
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: My whole family was coming back and forth to Paris--
Speaker 1: Right--
Speaker 2: --on People's airlines. People (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) 'cause that line was so affordable.
Speaker 2: --People airlines you could get like a thirty dollar ticket (laughter) or something to Paris. Aunt Arlene [Arlene Graham (ph.)] was in Paris (laughter).
Speaker 1: Your grandmother [Glover's maternal grandmother, Anna Lundy Lewis]?
Speaker 2: My grandmother didn't come to Paris.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: But like friends, Aunt Brenda [Brenda Mitchell], people were like coming to Paris.
Speaker 1: So you had all these people getting passports who'd never (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, my brothers came over.
Speaker 1: --had passports before--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Everything.
Speaker 2: Carlton [Carlton Glover], Abron [Abron Glover], we were, Abron, we came to Paris, so it was like okay, we're just living in Paris now. So coming home was like okay, we back home. Let's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, because you were, you were, you stayed closely connected?
Speaker 2: Only thing changed was the food.
Story_ID: 666212
Speaker 1: And then you are cast in 'Tap.'
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Which is a film.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And tell me what was that film and who, and who was in it.
Speaker 2: The movie 'Tap'--well, I, I have to say in Paris [France] at a show, at one of our shows, 'Black and Blue,' there was this guy in the balcony all alone, during the finale (claps hands). This guy is ranting in the aisle with joy and applause. This guy comes back stage, it's Gregory Hines. I'm still oblivious really, I don't, you know, everybody, is, "Oh, Gregory, Gregory, Gregory." I get off the elevator and I'm going, me and Michelle [ph.], Dianne's daughter, we're ready to go, he stops me.
Speaker 1: Dianne's daughter, who--
Speaker 2: Dianne Walker who is one of these, one of my educators.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was in 'Black and Blue,' she's one of the--
Speaker 1: Her--
Speaker 2: --Jimmy Slyde--
Speaker 1: Right, she was one of, that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) Lon Chaney, Dianne Walker.
Speaker 1: --your family and so--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you were with her daughter?
Speaker 2: Yep, we're with, you know, coming out the show like we usually do, probably going to roam the Champs-Elysees [Avenue des Champs-Elysees] (laughter). And Gregory stops me and he says, "You're going to be my son."
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And I say, "Okay" (laughter). Kept it moving. We come back home, he calls me in for the audition for the movie 'Tap,' I go in there, I tap, did I sing? I don't think I did any singing. And, and meanwhile we're about to do 'Black and Blue' on Broadway. So before 'Black and Blue' on Broadway we did the movie 'Tap.' In that movie, Sammy Davis, Jr., Gregory Hines, Jimmy Slyde, Pat Rico, Bunny Briggs, Harold Nicholas, Arthur Duncan, Suzzanne Douglas, oh, gosh.
Speaker 1: Joe Morton.
Speaker 2: Joe Morton.
Speaker 1: I mean, this is a star studded cast (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: And Henry LeTang was the choreographer.
Speaker 2: Henry LeTang, and me (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) At, at the ripe old age of sixteen?
Speaker 2: Yes. And I--
Speaker 1: Now at this point are you realizing this is a big deal?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I'm only realizing these men.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not, I don't exist. I'm at the party, I'm at the party, I've been invited, the party is about them. This is how I live my life, (laughter) you know.
Story_ID: 666213
Speaker 1: And the storyline is what?
Speaker 2: The storyline of, of the movie 'Tap'?
Speaker 1: 'Tap.'
Speaker 2: The storyline, Gregory [Gregory Hines], Max Washington was his character name, character's name, was a, you know, a small time criminal, thief, you know. But had this skillset, he can dance, he can tap dance. His family was from show business, his father. And there was this place, Sonny's [ph.], where all the cats would hang out and some hardcore challenges would occur. And he had a love interest, which was Suzzanne [Suzzanne Douglas], Amy [Amy Simms] was her character. And me, I was his son [Louis Simms], but he had run off. And so the, the movie is about him having to decide what he wants to do; does he wanna dance, does he wanna be a small time criminal. In the end he finds that he can't escape the rhythm, that, that dance just called him and the love, those men, those people in that environment, the dance called him and that's basically it.
Speaker 1: And, and so in this film you dance with him?
Speaker 2: I don't dance with him.
Speaker 1: You don't?
Speaker 2: No. I don't dance with Gregory in the movie.
Speaker 1: Do you dance with Sammy Davis, Jr.?
Speaker 2: No. I dance alone, I don't dance--I watch the challenge scene.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't dance with them in the movie. But when I wasn't behind--in front of the camera, I was watching what was being shot or filmed. But no, I don't dance with them in the movie.
Speaker 1: And when it's your time to dance in the movie what is your performance?
Speaker 2: My performance, my time to dance in the movie was a tradeoff. He, Greg- Max Washington the character, who was Gregory, would say, "Listen, I need you to teach this guy how to tap dance in this thing." It was, he was the only boy in the class so he thought this guy, who was Nick Castle, the director, it was his son [Louis Castle], he thought that tap dancing was for girls so Gregory asked me to teach this guy a lesson. I'm like, "No, I ain't tap dancing" (makes sounds). I'm playing basketball and doing whatever. So he says, he taught me how to do three card molly [sic. three card Monte], so he won, he wins the bet, so I have to go teach this guy a lesson. I get in the room and I realize like not only is it about the little boy, but I have to tell these kids about tap dancing, like, you know, when you dance you gotta dance clean and you boom, boom, boom. And I say--I see that they like it and I say, oh, okay, let me, let me show y'all really how it's done so to say, and then I do my routine.
Story_ID: 666214
Speaker 1: And then as an observer on set you're watching the masters at work?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's the time of my life.
Speaker 1: Did you get to, to talk to Sammy Davis, Jr.?
Speaker 2: Oh, every day.
Speaker 1: What did you learn from him?
Speaker 2: Oh my gosh, I mean, not, not only, not only on the set but when we were, when we would travel and, and promote the movie ['Tap'] and whatnot. Sammy Davis was, I mean, that's the thing about all of these cats like they were so cool. You know, when they weren't filming, they, everybody would be on the patio, Sammy would be there drinking Kool-Aid (laughter). You know, what I mean like, they, they'd just be all talking about early happenings and showbiz stuff or, or, or current events, you know, and I'd just be there listening, listening, taking it all in, you know, what I mean. So it's like, when people ask me like what do you, what did I learn from these men or what did you learn from Sammy Davis, Jr.? It's like I learned how to be a man, I learned how to be a human being, I learned how to exist as a man. I learned--after my mother's [Yvette Glover] teachings, I learned how to be a man through these men, how to be a black man in America in show business (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's huge.
Speaker 2: I learned how to communicate with people, you know. So again it's not like they taught me all of these dance things but the humanitarian skills or just how to exist, you know. It was more of an intellectual--
Speaker 1: Did they ever talk--
Speaker 2: --thing.
Speaker 1: --about race and its conflict?
Speaker 2: Jimmy Slyde would speak about race. He had a thing about, whenever we'd have to go to Germany he'd have a thing about that. But again, not publicly vocal, you know. I was aware, they made it aware, or they made me aware that yes, they knew about whatever, everything that was going on in the world but didn't harp on it, you know.
Story_ID: 666215
Speaker 1: I think it was the next year, you're seventeen and you're now choreographing--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --at the Apollo, it's a festival for the Apollo Theater [New York, New York], the Rat-A-Tat-Tap Festival (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: So talk to me about the transition from dancing to choreographing, 'cause it, that's a different skill.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I, I started teaching at, at--
Speaker 1: Fourteen, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, like fourteen years old I'm teaching tap class.
Speaker 1: Where were you teaching?
Speaker 2: I was teaching at Broadway Dance Center--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which was Hines and Hatchett [Hines-Hatchett], here in Manhattan [New York]. And--
Speaker 1: So the same place where you had been taught--
Speaker 2: Same place.
Speaker 1: --you now start teaching--
Speaker 2: Same place.
Speaker 1: --at the ripe old age of fourteen?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I have not, even though I've traveled the world, I haven't traveled far (laughter). I've been going from right here to right here. So I'm teaching there. So, and now that I think about it, again, me teaching is like, it just has, it's just factual, it's just as a matter of fact. I'm like, okay, I'm going to teach y'all to, I'm going to teach you how to tap dance, okay (laughter), you know. It was no big deal to me teaching tap class. So as--
Speaker 1: So choreographing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, choreographing and then, it, you, my choreography was--so I know Henry LeTang, I have, I have this relationship with Henry LeTang. So my choreography became an extension of--
Speaker 1: Of LeTang?
Speaker 2: --what I was being taught, you know. I was, it was now my opportunity or chance to create so to say.
Speaker 1: And in 1990, you know, tap is not the, the art form that everybody is trying to do.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, yes, Gregory Hines is on the scene and still--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it's not, it's not popular at all, again (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, no.
Speaker 2: --like they say it goes back and forth with its popularity but--
Speaker 1: And the music that's popular in 1990 is--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --rap and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --hip hop.
Speaker 2: Hip hop is heavy now, you know, hip hop is transitioning and becoming more heard or visible.
Speaker 1: And so as you are having that in your ear 'cause this is the music you're listening to, in these early days of choreography and teaching, are you being influenced by your musical choices yet?
Speaker 2: Definitely. My, my first piece I choreographed was to [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones' 'Back on the Block.'
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: "Birdland." So he had Kool Moe Dee [HistoryMaker Mohandas "Kool Moe Dee" DeWese], he had Big Daddy Kane, Dizzy Gillespie, like Ella Fitzgerald, you know, so it was that, it was a mix. I'm able to have my hip hop and my jazz, so Quincy did that for me (laughter). But I, you know, it wasn't, again, it wasn't until 'Noise, Funk' ['Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk,' Reg E. Gaines] where I--I would, I would stick to the swing, we gotta be swinging, it was swinging. I was--
Speaker 1: That was the safe zone.
Speaker 2: That was a safe zone for tap dancing and still is a safe--
Speaker 1: Sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) zone.
Speaker 1: And, and so as it's a safe zone people are becoming much more aware of you--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and what you're doing, and just the fact that there's a young black man tap dancing is opening eyes to this art form that people thought of as old?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Are you, you're, you're, you're, you're still a teenager at this point?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Are you feeling any responsibility or you're just, still just--
Speaker 2: No, I'm not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) on your journey?
Speaker 2: I'm on my journey. I have, I don't feel any responsibility in that way. I, my only responsibility was to these cats, to these men and women responsible for my, my upbringing, you know, as a, as a tap dancer. I don't, you know, everybody used to say, "Oh, it's your, you're the, you're carrying the torch," and (makes sounds).
Speaker 1: So they are saying it to you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, being heard, I'm being, I'm hearing this but that's not my job (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you feel comfortable understanding--
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely.
Speaker 1: --pushing back?
Speaker 2: No, no, my--my job is to make sure that you know about these men.
Speaker 1: That the--you're on that singular journey still.
Speaker 2: That's it.
Story_ID: 666216
Speaker 1: Now, at, this same year there's a tragedy, your understudy is killed.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Pronunciation) Hassoun Ta- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Hassoun, Hassoun Tatum.
Speaker 1: Hassoun Tatum. This is a, also young man correct?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How, how does that effect you?
Speaker 2: Well, again, that was a hard, that was a hard, (pause) a hard moment. Hassoun was, this was the first time that I had even heard of the idea of someone being sniped down. But that was, you know, that was a, that was, I went, that was an emotional wreck for me. Hassoun was the first young person who I had witnessed transition in my life, so his death just, I guess, added another perspective to my life and to my conscious at the time.
Speaker 1: Even though you're from Newark [New Jersey] and there's shoot 'em up all around--
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: --but you're not, it's no one close to you?
Speaker 2: No, no, no. That, I mean close like love.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I knew little homie or whoever, you know, probably but, you know. These were--Hassoun, I mean, these are personal relationships, you know, so when we lose that, it was devastating.
Story_ID: 666217
Speaker 1: The same year you begin to dance on 'Sesame Street'?
Speaker 2: (Nods head) Hm.
Speaker 1: In 1990?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So 'Sesame Street' at this point is huge. Every child watches it. Every child (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Nods head) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: It's very popular. It's, you know, you're dancing with these characters and how, how, what is it like on set? How, how does it work?
Speaker 2: 'Sesame Street,' well, it's very interesting. The, the environment is great, you know. Always (gesture)--
Speaker 1: Puppets?
Speaker 2: Not puppets but always some gimmick or somebody was always doing something (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: You know, you gotta do like twenty takes because somebody is gonna pop up and do something to speak--you, you got the Big Bird voice coming out of Oscar the Grouch and it's a joke and it's, you know, it, it was fun, it was very fun. It was a, just fun environment. But for me it was, again, it was like I was just--I wasn't playing a character, I was playing me, I was me on the block, I was Savion [HistoryMaker Savion Glover] who had been a resident or teaching at a dance school on Sesame Street. So, again, it was just another thing to do.
Speaker 1: And they had, you, you were on quite a bit, were you not?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was on for like, I did 'Sesame Street' maybe about five years or something like that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause I remember they were at, I was there when they were at this one location in time, I'm sorry, uptown on like 50 something street and then they moved out to Queens [New York], Silvercup Studio [Silvercup Studios]--
Story_ID: 666218
Speaker 1: And while you were on 'Sesame Street' you danced with Gregory Hines on the show didn't you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I was doing 'Jelly's,' we were doing 'Jelly's Last Jam' [George C. Wolfe].
Speaker 1: Oh, it was at that time?
Speaker 2: I believe, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So they, they crossed over?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I believe we were doing 'Jelly's Last Jam' at the time, was it--no, no, no, that was 'Black and Blue.' I think, I think, that was around the time of 'Black and Blue' 'cause I was older, I was driving.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's how you can tell?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I was driving during 'Sesame Street.'
Speaker 1: So at this point a car is not coming to get you, you're bringing yourself to town (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no, I'm, I'm, I'm chilling now, I got my own car. I got a--
Speaker 1: And it's not a Nova [Chevrolet Nova].
Speaker 2: And it's not a Nova, it's a Chevy Blazer [Chevrolet Blazer].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's a Chevy Blazer, four door Chevy Blazer with a booming system (laughter). I had to have my system.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And let, let's talk about 'Jelly's Last Jam' 'cause that, that's a big show.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] George C. Wolfe--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --created it.
Speaker 2: 'Jelly's Last Jam,' the story of Jelly Roll Morton and who he was or who he thought he was. And, you know, George is, you know, brilliant, or a genius in this area. Still it's like, the story was like, did he invent jazz? You know, they're kind of skeptical on that but he thinks, he thought that he was the inventor of jazz, you know. And then it was a battle against his Creole heirs, sort of denying who he really was or his family and whatnot like that. That was a great opportunity and show (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And your role in the play?
Speaker 2: I played young Jelly. I played young Gregory Hines, Gregory was Jelly Roll, I was young Jelly. And so I showed how he came up and through the clubs and going in places where he shouldn't have necessarily been, and then being abandoned, not abandoned totally, he just, Grand Mama [sic. Gran Mimi] sort of kicked him out for hanging out and being in the wrong places according to her and, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And so you are now, the acting classes that you've taken in the past, you're now applying that, right, 'cause this is, is this acting or is this, some?
Speaker 2: (Makes sounds) Yes.
Speaker 1: I mean, you're dancing?
Speaker 2: I'm dancing mostly, but I'm acting like I know how to act (laughter). I'm acting like I know how to act.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: And I was a good actor (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, and, and you're still representing the, these--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --the elders?
Speaker 2: Yes, definitely (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean, that's what this play is about--
Speaker 2: Definitely, definitely. The dance, I'm, I'm representing the dance.
Speaker 1: And, and this cast has who in it?
Speaker 2: 'Jelly's Last Jam,' Gregory Hines, Tonya Pinkett-Smith [sic.], no, Tonya--
Speaker 1: Tonya Pinkins.
Speaker 2: Tonya Pinkins, right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Tonya Pinkins. Ruben, Ruben Santiago [HistoryMaker Ruben Santiago-Hudson] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Santiago-Hudson.
Speaker 2: --Hudson, Keith David.
Speaker 1: Right. [HistoryMaker] Phylicia Rashad.
Speaker 2: Phylicia Rashad later on joined after Tonya. Ben Vereen joined after, after Keith David left. And Brian Stokes [HistoryMaker Brian Stokes Mitchell] after, after Gregory left.
Speaker 1: Right. And how long were you in the show?
Speaker 2: I was, however long it was on.
Speaker 1: The whole, the whole run (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, I did the whole, from beginning to end.
Speaker 1: Five hundred and sixty-nine performances?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. And then I did the tour. Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you, so for how many years?
Speaker 2: What did we do? What was that five, five years (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let's see here. That's a long time. So '91 [1991] to '94 [1994], four years.
Speaker 2: Four years.
Speaker 1: Four years.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Because the, the show lasted on Broadway, I mean, that's a lot of performances--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --five hundred and sixty-nine. And then, and then you went all over the country?
Speaker 2: Went over the country touring with the show, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you travel internationally with the show as well?
Speaker 2: Not with 'Jelly's Last Jam.'
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 666219
Speaker 1: And how do you feel that 'Jelly's'--what did 'Jelly's' do to your career?
Speaker 2: 'Jelly's Last Jam' [George C. Wolfe] to my career--
Speaker 1: What was its importance?
Speaker 2: You know, I, I don't know. (Pause) I, it's like tap dancing for me--my career, I don't, it's weird. I don't, it's like, it's like, so show business and tap dancing are two separate things for me. What did it do to my career? Allow me to gain more notoriety, not more work.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: More notoriety, you know. (Pause) Because I didn't do anything like between 'Jelly's Last Jam' and then 'Noise, Funk' ['Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk,' Reg E. Gaines]. I just, I, I did 'Jelly's Last Jam' and then we did the tour and then again, I would continue to do tap dance shows around with these cats, travel around the world with Jimmy Slyde and, you know, Lon Chaney and, and, and the cats until they transitioned. So I didn't like do (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So it didn't turn, as you said it didn't turn into work?
Speaker 2: No. No. I, I continued to accept these invitations, you know.
Story_ID: 666220
Speaker 1: I always say like my career has been by, by invitation only. I did not--I, the shows I auditioned for I got. Like, I auditioned for 'Black and Blue,' and I auditioned for the movie 'Tap,' that was the end of my audition world or trial, you know. It was just, "Hey, you wanna do this?"
Speaker 2: Invitation.
Speaker 1: "Hey, you wanna do this?" Yeah, (laughter) by invitation. And everything was that safe zone environment, whether it was with George Wolfe [HistoryMaker George C. Wolfe]--what I mean by safe zone, I mean the story, what was the show, what were we doing, we were telling the story of me, my culture, where, who was I with, I was with Gregory [Gregory Hines] (laughter). If I'm not with Gregory, who am I with? I'm with Jimmy Slyde. If I'm not with Jimmy Slyde, I'm with Buster Brown [James "Buster" Brown]. If we're not all together doing a show, performing, traveling, I'm in this safe zone, I know I'm gone be with these men.
Speaker 2: So it's the same exact thing as when you were growing up?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The safe zone between (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --the different households.
Speaker 1: Yeah. These elderly people, aside from my knucklehead friends and whatnot, it was elderly people always, always from Barr [Annie Barr (ph.)] on. I was always into wanting to be around elderly people. I wanted to be with Barr more than I wanted to be with my friends outside. You know, I, I wanted to, I've had some heavy like arguments with family members about the importance of Jimmy Slyde or Buster Brown. You know, like elderly people seemed back then to know more than me, (laughter) you know, so I wanted to learn, I was always available to learn. I love learning, 'til this day I like learning. And I feel that these men had so much to teach me, you know. And to this day that environment, whether it's a Spike Lee or a, a George Wolfe, or Hinton Battle or, you know, just these environments that allow me to stay focused on my reality and not show business, you know. I love it, I love being able to perform on--whether it's on, we're on TV or doing whatever but I haven't had the opportunity to lose my focus on my personal journey in this world. The dance is my vehicle but I still have a reason personally that I exist in this world. And sometimes I think when we allow the accolades and these other energies to come in and sort of invade your personal mission, your, you know, we get kind of distracted and, you know. I, I, I blame it on my, I blame my work on allowing me to stay focused on what I am and who I am and why I am, you know.
