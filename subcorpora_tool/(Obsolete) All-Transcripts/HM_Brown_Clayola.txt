Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe, I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns, observing is Teresa Deere [ph.] and [HistoryMaker] Paul Brock.  Ma'am, could you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My name is Clayola Beatrice Oliver Brown [HistoryMaker Clayola Brown].  First name is spelled C-L-A-Y-O-L-A, the middle name Beatrice is B-E-A-T-R-I-C-E, Oliver, O-L-I-V-E-R, and Brown like the color.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there a story behind the name Clayola?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm from South Carolina and we happen to believe that, at least this is what my momma [Annabell Jenkins Shands] told me, that when a woman has gone through a number of miscarriages the belief is that if you name that next pregnancy, if it's a girl, after the earth and after the oldest living relative that that child will stand a chance for survival.  So I was named Clay, after the earth and Ola after my Aunt Ola, who my great--grand--Aunt Ola who was about eighty-seven at the time that I was born.
Speaker 1: That's an interesting story is that a, is that a--do you know the origin of that belief?
Speaker 2: Well, my [maternal] grandfather [Jake Jenkins (ph.)], who lived until he was 107, was African and all of his beliefs and activities, and it's a story that's told through Gullah.  I certainly have lost the language I did know at one point in my life.  But, my grandfather is the one who insisted on giving the history through our actions to the family, and that's where that kind of piece came from.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you for that.
Speaker 2: Uh-hm, sure.
Speaker 1: That's a, that's a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure.
Speaker 1: --interesting story.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Eight, four, forty-eight [August 4, 1948] and I was born in Charleston, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I am an international vice president for a trade union, UNITE HERE.  And UNITE HERE is the newly merged, well not so newly anymore, it's two years merged union of clothing workers [Union of Needletrades, Industrial, and Textile Employees (UNITE)] and hotel and restaurant employees [Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union (HERE)].  I do the civil rights programs for that union as its civil rights director, and I am the newly elected president of the A. Philip Randolph Institute [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay and what's today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is the 13th of July, '05 [2005].
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: Right now we are in Milwaukee, Wisconsin at the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] convention (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 278261
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth there are five People magazine-ish type questions that I am always asked to ask people.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they--they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.

Story_ID: 278262
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --and your father's [Prezzie Oliver] side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But we'll start with your mother's side of the family.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Her full name is Annabell Jenkins Shands, Annabell is spelled Annabell but pronounced Annabell, that's that South Carolina flavor, A-N-N-I-E is how it's pronounced but A-N-N-A, is how it is spelled, Jenkins, traditional and Shands, S-H-A-N-D-S.
Speaker 1: S, I'm sorry--
Speaker 2: H-A-N-D-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: February 7, 1923, and she was born in Vance, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace the ancestors?
Speaker 2: Well my grandfather was my mom's father, his name was Jake Jenkins [ph.].  I had an opportunity to have him in my life for quite a while because he did live until he was 107.  He was third generation to Charleston [South Carolina].  His grandfather actually came to the city as a slave, can be documented through papers, connections to a white family from Tradd Street, downtown Charleston by the waterfront.  My grandmother, who died very early in her mid-sixties from diabetes; I was ten when she passed away.  Her family side is what I got to know as I got older.
Story_ID: 278263
Speaker 1: Where were they from?  Were they from Charleston [South Carolina], too?
Speaker 2: Charleston was the home port; Vance [South Carolina] actually was the home port.  My [maternal] grandfather [Jake Jenkins (ph.)] moved the entire family to Charleston, I guess it was '46 [1946].  He was sharecropping in a little town called Holly Hill, South Carolina.  The steel mills in Charleston opened up its employment to blacks in the foundry side, and my grandfather had never gotten a paycheck, a real paycheck, paycheck.  I remember even as he first worked in Charleston our having to live on the existence of what was called a book.  A spiral notebook where on that farm they recorded how much you raised in the field and how much the crop sold for, and you got a credit.  I don't remember really seeing money, money until my grandfather moved our entire family into Charleston.  He moved in to work but would commute the fifty-four miles, and I guess I was maybe five or six when everybody else moved into Charleston.  He was so proud having a job that gave him a piece of paper that then turned into money that he had full decision on how it was going to be spent.  And I remember the discussions when the family was talking about whether or not we should leave the security of where we lived into the big city, and Charleston to our family was the big city.
Speaker 1: So you were born in Vance and then moved to Charleston when you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was actually born in Charleston because--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because my mother [Annabell Jenkins Shands] had had complications in her pregnancies, I was the seventh child that she had and the only one that lived.  We had relatives that lived in Charleston, and they took her to Charleston for me to be born and for those older relatives to take care of her.  That's how I ended up being born in Charleston as opposed to Holly Hill or Vance where--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the family lived.
Story_ID: 278264
Speaker 1: Are there any stories that are passed down through your family about, about your ancestors on your mother's [Annabell Jenkins Shands] side?
Speaker 2: Well my [maternal] grandfather [Jake Jenkins (ph.)] was the story teller.  Christmas was his birthday, Christmas Day and he would begin Christmas morning and the exchanging of grits--gifts with the family story.  He talked about the relatives that he could remember and the legacy that came with being proud and being a Jenkins.  Each of us as children would mouth the story as he told it because it was the same story every Christmas and as a child it seemed a bit mundane to us, you know, hearing the same thing but as we became teenagers and then adults the wealth of the stories became something very precious to us.  My son [Alfred Brown, Jr.], who is now thirty-two, at ten surprised our entire family by telling the story that he remembered from his great-grandfather, which then made us understand just how rich the oral history was to us all.  You have to understand my grandfather ran this family, it did not matter how old each the children was, you still asked permission to move from one city to another or what you were gonna do in your family if there was difficulty.  So, everybody's business became a part of the story as he told it every Christmas before we had dinner.  So those (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So this is the, the family history, the story was?
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: Or was it--okay.
Speaker 2: That was his story every Christmas for us.  He would tell us who was related to whom, who got married to who. He told us all the good and all the dirt about what happened as folks got grown, got gone, got married, had children.  Who took the rag off the bush which is old black expression when the women in the family became pregnant and they may not have been married.  How they then got married once the family figured out what had happened.  Who left home without permission and ran up north as it was always called, which seemed like a really faraway place to us when we were tiny and hearing the stories.  He chronicled the movement of our family so that we would not lose touch with who we were, and he also made us very responsible to one another as a result of those stories because Christmas was also collection time.  If there was a new child born you paid into the family pot to make sure that folks had a shot at an education.  My grandpa never went to school and each of us as grandchildren had to teach him a brand new word, how to spell it and how to say it because mixed into his dialogue was the Gullah word for the English word.  Like a frying pan he called a spider and there were a number of those that, you know, if I sat for a minute I could remember them.  But it was like learning a second language (laughter) speaking to my grandfather because Gullah was so thick for him.
Story_ID: 278265
Speaker 1: I'm not exactly sure of the tribes and all of the rest of it that goes with the explanation because like you, it depends on who's telling that story and want to lay claim to the heritage, but what I do know about Gullah, as it was exposed to my family, is the actual language and the cadence of how it was spoken.  My [maternal] grandfather [Jake Jenkins (ph.)] would mix the English words with the African words and would have it come at a quicker rate than how we speak now.  South Carolinians have a very thick accent anyway, and, when I'm real relaxed, or have had a martini or two, you can certainly here my South Carolina lineage a lot better.  But, it's rhythmic, it's almost Caribbean in sound, but I don't know which tribes because there are a number of tribes both African and Indian [Native American] in the area of Charleston [South Carolina] that I come from.  All of those languages got mixed over the years.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was a little bit of Gullah in the movie, 'Glory.'
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Remember the, when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: the, when the 54th [Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment]--
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh-hm.
Speaker 2: --they're coming into Darien [Georgia], I think, and the, the towns people are saying something about, "When the Yankee man com'" or something and they were like--it sound like a Caribbean dialect (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, so--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was close to authentic but not quite.
Speaker 2: It wasn't quite huh.
Speaker 1: Not quite.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Not quite.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: It was more Caribbean than Gullah.
Speaker 2: Can, can you speak any--
Speaker 1: I don't--
Speaker 2: --at all?
Speaker 1: --any longer, I, I really don't have it any longer, and I would feel foolish even in attempting to do it (laughter) so--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay,
Speaker 1: --but I don't--
Speaker 2: We don't have any martinis around here or anything, so.
Speaker 1: Catch me on a good night and I can roll some Gullah for ya, I betcha (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, that, and to your understanding what does Gullah mean in terms of your--is there, is there any difference between Geechee and Gullah?
Speaker 1: Now see those are fightin' words when folks call us Geechee because the Geechee connotates ignorance as far as our interpretation.  Folks say that it's a regional description of who we are, but a Geechee is someone who has a really lousy command of the English language, that's why you'll find a lot of South Carolinians will take their time to articulate their words to make sure that you understand what they're saying because it was always a negative saying, "God, you sound just like a Geechee."  And it, it's the rolling of the words and the chopping of the S's and the--that kinda of thing that made you a Geechee, plus saying that you eat a whole heap'a rice that's why you sound the way you do, but, you know.  But Gullah, Gullah is a language; Geechee is a style of life.
Speaker 2: Okay and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --it's often used in a derogatory way--
Speaker 1: It's often used in a derogatory way--
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 278266
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Annabell Jenkins Shands] talk about growing up to you at all?
Speaker 2: Some. My mother, I do know that she started to work as early as seven.  The kind of work was what was traditional for the area, and when I say that I mean purely just working as a housekeeper, or babysitter in somebody's house.  Factory work did not come to South Carolina until later or at least to the Charleston [South Carolina] area because now, as it was then, tourism and hospitality was always the focus.  It's the genteel culture of the city that was always emphasized as a way to keep it afloat.  But my mother at seven got her first job, and, because the family needed the money, she was in school only until the seventh grade, until I became married and had my child [Alfred Brown, Jr.] and she decided she was not having a grandchild that finished school and she didn't.  She went back to school and got her high school diploma and then went back to school again and got her nursing certificates and.  But for her, school--growing up was the field work like everybody else, and after I was born she took me with her. It was cotton and soybeans and some tobacco.  And for her it was rice, most of the rice growing was not there when I was coming up, so.  But she talks about her young life and family life in a romantic kind of way, which pretty much tied her into the stories that my [maternal] grandfather [Jake Jenkins (ph.)] told.
Story_ID: 278267
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My birth father's name was Prezzie Oliver, P-R-E-Z-Z-I-E, and he and my mother [Annabell Jenkins Shands] were married until I was six and my stepfather, who I know as my father-father, his name is William Edward ["Buddy"] Shands, last name is S-H-A-N-D-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you know much about your birth father's ancestors and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah. My birth father who passed away three years ago, I continued to see him as I was growing up.  My mother insisted.
Speaker 1: What is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My father's date of birth was October 13th, '21 [1921].
Speaker 1: Okay and was he born in Vance [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: He was born in Holly Hill [South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Holly Hill?
Speaker 2: Holly Hill.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's about fifty-four miles from Charleston [South Carolina], seven miles from Vance.
Speaker 1: Okay, are there any stories from his side of the family about his ancestors or--
Speaker 2: Well my father was Indian [Native American] and he--the Indian was Choctaw, my [paternal] grandmother, who was full-blooded Indian, I met her only once before she passed away, that I can remember, of course she was there when I was a baby, but she died when I was five I think, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you say, Chickasaw or--
Speaker 2: Choctaw.
Speaker 1: Choctaw, how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: I knew you were gonna ask me that, I don't know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: I think it's C-H-I-C-T-A-W-U [sic.].  I think that's how it's spelled.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know my grandfather from my father's side at all.
Speaker 1: So he, he was a full-blooded Indian or was he--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah my, my father was.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and, now did you know much about this group of Indians and, or what they--
Speaker 2: No, not really, and, if I'm gonna be real, I was not really close to the family until I was probably about fourteen.  I saw my dad often, who never re-married and still considered my mother his wife, which you can very well understand was problematic with my new dad (laughter).  I have one living aunt left who is now in her nineties, my Aunt Clara [ph.], his sister.  But the family basically is still in the Holly Hill, Vance area, did not move from the area where they were born and raised.  Very private people, and it was unusual for the marriage that my mom and dad had to take place.
Story_ID: 278268
Speaker 1: They were married very young, my mom [Annabell Jenkins Shands] was only seventeen, and my dad [Prezzie Oliver] was eighteen, nineteen (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --almost nineteen.
Speaker 2: Now is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 1: Workin' the fields one summer.  In a place that was--well in Orangeburg [South Carolina], you may know something about South Carolina, but in Orangeburg.  They met like that, physically they were about eleven miles apart, and there was not a whole lot to do except it was considered fun to be able to go away to do field work 'cause that's when you met all the boys, as my mother described it, or all the girls as he talked about, and that's how they met.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right--
Speaker 1: That's how they met.
Speaker 2: So they were married six--well, until you were six years old--
Speaker 1: Until I was six years old.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 278269
Speaker 1: And what about your stepfather [William Shands], what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born March 18th, also '21 [1921], if I'm remembering correctly, yeah.  He was born in Virginia, Portsmouth, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He comes from a [U.S.] military background.  He himself was a sailor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One of two children, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you know much about his family history?
Speaker 2: I remember my grandmother very little.  I just remember that she was very dignified woman.  Her name was Schapronia [sic. Saphorina Sands], which to me was very romantic, I liked saying (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How do you spell that--
Speaker 2: --her name, oh my--
Speaker 1: --I mean--
Speaker 2: --S-C-H-A-P-R-O-N-I-A [sic.], Schapronia.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, that's an interesting name, do you know where it comes from or--
Speaker 2: I do not know where it comes from, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so--
Speaker 2: But a very dignified lady, classy lady.
Story_ID: 278270
Speaker 1: Now can you describe your, your parents', all three of them, personality and, and tell us who do you think you take after, you know?  Or, or were influenced the most by?
Speaker 2: Well I can tell you what my [maternal] grandfather [Jake Jenkins (ph.)] used to say about my dad [Prezzie Oliver], he wasn't worth a plug nickel walkin' or ridin'. I do know that he was a very generous man with his love and affection.  Kind, happy-go-lucky kinda guy, very good-looking man, which was the problem in the family (laughter), strong and independent.  My stepdad [William Shands], very quiet-natured man (unclear), very loving as well, to this day the rock that our small family is built on.  And my mother [Annabell Jenkins Shands] the rebel, not afraid of anything walkin' or riding, got me fired from ever job I had for the first three years of my life as a worker.  Six feet tall in her stocking feet, tough sister, very strong, very strong.  The pride of the family, now the matriarch of the family, and she's assumed the role that my grandfather had--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --so--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: I'm very much like her, because she insisted on it.
Story_ID: 278271
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about growing up.  Now you grew up basically in Charleston [South Carolina] I guess, and--
Speaker 2: Some, my mom [Annabell Jenkins Shands] and dad got married when I was six; my mom married my stepdad [William Shands] when I was six.  He was in the [U.S.] Navy; we traveled, first to Key West, Florida, that's the first place I remember.  From Key West, Florida to the West Coast, National City, California, San Diego [California], and then Ventura County [California], the Oxnard [California], Point Mugu [California] area.  My uncle lived in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and when my dad was transferred back to the East Coast my mom did not want me to go to school in Charleston, so I went to my uncle to finish high school.  So from Philadelphia down to Florida to do college [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and that's how our--my family moved around.
Speaker 1: Wow. Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I remember when we first moved to Key West, Florida.  My family was a large family and a very tightly knit family, so I remember only family members until then.  When we went to Key West it was my mom, my stepdad and I.  My earliest memory perhaps is one--we unpacked our truck in Key West, and it was my first interaction with a little white boy who was on the other side of Fort [Zachary] Taylor [Key West, Florida], which was the military base where we were moving to.  A beautiful beach which absolutely hypnotized me, and I went running down to the edge of the water not understanding that I was to stay on our side of the fence, the colored side of the fence.  He rubbed my arm and looked at me and said, "It doesn't come off."  I wasn't quite sure what he meant but I knew it ticked me off pretty good, and when it dawned on me that he was making fun of my skin color I was one day in Key West, Florida and having my very first fight, which caused my family some angst, but my mother was proud.  My father was devastated, because we were just (laughter) one day on the base.  But that's my earliest childhood, you know, memory of something that was a marker.
Story_ID: 278272
Speaker 1: Of all these different places, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, the ocean became very important to me from Key West [Florida] and all of the other cities that we lived in because my dad, my stepdad [William Shands] choose the ocean for us to have our talks.  He was trying to get to know me, too, he was one of two so it was like he was an only child, he left home at seventeen to become a sailor and had not had a lot of exposure to children but he was determined to be my father, and I thank God for that today.  Our conversations took place down by the ocean when he was explaining what the shells were, when he talked to me about God, when he talked to me about pride and waking me up early in the morning to make me see what the sun look like coming up or, or sitting on the steps because we lived close enough to the water that we could look across the street through the fence and see the sun going down and those were the sounds and the smells and the sights that continue to be important to me.  When I check into a hotel today I wanna know what's the view is there any water close by and up the window goes so that I can hear it if it is 'cause that's that cushion of comfort that's become my comfort zone.  The other is collard greens and chicken and oh, baked sweet potatoes and those smells and tastes are really important to me, too.
Speaker 1: Any sounds associated with growing up?
Speaker 2: Laughter, lot's of that, that more than anything.  But the markers of losing family members and the absolute pain that you could here when people were mourning just kinda stick to your ears when you're a small child.  My [maternal] grandmother died when I was ten and, and my mother [Annabell Jenkins Shands] who is so solidly strong crying out loud and really sobbing confused me because I had never seen her vulnerable before.  I had always seen her straight back and with a smile and encouraging that support system and to watch her crumble at the passing of her mom, my grandmother, was just really pretty difficult, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --remember that for sure.
Story_ID: 278273
Speaker 1: Was music a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother [Annabell Jenkins Shands], she would walk around the house doin' all kinds of blues stuff to make me laugh.  I have no brothers and sisters, so she's been my best friend for my entire life, but she'd break into song and just do the little dances doing things like, "I got a little red rooster and man how he could sing," you know, or things like that just having a really good time.  So I was exposed to blues and church music from my mother's side and my dad, my stepdad [William Shands] he was always playing jazz and explaining to me how deep it was and who the players were.  I of course, tried to use that when I got to college [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] I wanted to be a deep thinker so I had no idea the influence of the music but it began to help me think through my moods.  My joy was expressed with my blues records, my sadness through the jazz and being able to communicate to them by asking for a particular kind of record to be sent.  That's when they made records, "Could you send me my care package some Etta James this week," or something.  So they knew what was going on pretty much with me just by the music I asked them for or whatever they would hear playing in the background when they called me.
Speaker 1: Did you a favorite kind of music yourself or favorite artist?
Speaker 2: Etta James is probably my favorite.  I love Billie Holiday's ['The] Silver Collection,' and I think I liked Miles Davis a lot until I got old enough to understand who he was and once I recognized who and how he was it was over, over, I could not be true to my sisterhood if I didn't (laughter) feel that way so, but.
Speaker 1: His earlier work was actually, you know, be--well, I guess he was--his personality probably always the same but his, his earlier work was probably the--I shouldn't even give an opinion about that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All of his work is wonderful work but the work alone is not enough 'cause I could see his treatment of females every time I'd hear something and I'd wanna just snatch that trumpet from him, but.
Story_ID: 278274
Speaker 1: --Was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, you didn't have an option when it came to church.  Sunday morning you were up, and even after we moved to Charleston [South Carolina], it was a fifty-four mile drive back to the church in Vance [South Carolina], because that's where the family church was, that was the adventure day actually because my [maternal] grandmother would cook, she would fry ham and make biscuits and there were these big cans that syrup came in, I don't know if you're familiar with the syrup called Alaga Syrup with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Alaga, well--
Speaker 2: --the blue ribbon on it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Willie Mayes was raised on it and--
Speaker 2: Oh baby. My grandma would pour some of the syrup in the bottom, put the biscuits on top of that and the ham on top of that, and if you were really gonna be treated, which meant church was gonna last all day long, she'd fry some sweet potatoes that were sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon and that would go on top of that and your can would get tied in a handkerchief, a big handkerchief with a knot on the top, that was your can, because my cousins and I all went to church with my grandmother and my [maternal] grandfather [Jake Jenkins (ph.)] and the cans would get lined up in the back in the trunk in a box.  So your behavior in church determined whether or not you were getting your can at the end of the day.  So she didn't have to do anything except turned her head to the side a little bit and do like that which meant, "Mind, I got your can."  All we saw during church, never mind what the preacher said, we saw what that can had in it and if it was a candy apple or cinnamon candied yams day, we were the best behaved children in church forever (laughter). But it was the music of church and watching the preachers, I know this might sound disrespectful but it was true, watching the preachers perform that really got us fired up.  Our preacher was kind of dry, but those visiting pastors, who could grunt and moan and draw those words out really long, oh the passion that they would evoke would have us shouting in the back until we got popped for actin' up.  But church was a big deal we didn't have any options, every Sunday.
Speaker 1: Okay now, what was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: Vance Baptist Church [Vance, South Carolina] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Vance Baptist Church, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Vance Baptist Church.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: With the, with the right Reverend Seebrook [ph.] (laughter) and I'm being funny at this point.  Minister Brooks [ph.] was the pastor and we nicknamed him the right Reverend Seebrook because everything he saw when he came to dinner he would eat, so Seebrook ate every big piece of chicken that ever laid on the table and we were not real happy about that so the children, all my cousins and I we called him Seebrook, he'd see all that and he broke at it--
Speaker 1: You're not the first person I've interviewed who's complained about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --about the appetites--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --of preachers, visiting preachers--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and this one was sincere, this complaint is absolutely sincere 'cause he could eat.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the wife wasn't bad either, she had a pretty good sized appetite, too.
Story_ID: 278275
Speaker 1: How would people describe you when you were growing up, I mean what would people say about your personality and what was it really like?
Speaker 2: I heard most often, "Lord that child is sure enough like her mama [Annabell Jenkins Shands]."  And, not understanding what that meant it's become a great deal of what I pull from now because my mother, she says exactly what she means, she makes no apologies for her opinions, it is what it is, you either live to accept it or die with it.  I know that I became very determined as a result of her guidance, and I heard that a lot.  Some folks described it as being stubborn, my mother called it determination and I choose to believe my mother more than anyone else so.  I hear that a lot, she's very determined.
Story_ID: 278276
Speaker 1: Now, well, tell us about school, where did you go to grade school?
Speaker 2: Grade school, I went the first part of my kindergarten, first grade in Charleston [South Carolina]; of course the schools were segregated then.  I went to East Bay Elementary [Sanders-Clyde Elementary, Charleston, South Carolina] and Daniel Jenkins' project which is no longer in existence, in Charleston.  And, I did second and third grade in Key West, Florida and we moved back, too (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now is that a [U.S. Navy] base school, I guess or--
Speaker 2: It was a public school off--
Speaker 1: Public school?
Speaker 2: --the base.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The school that was on the base was a white school.  So those of us who were on the black side of the [U.S.] military base went to school in town.
Speaker 1: So they segregated the military base and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, are you surprised by that (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Well we, we just today--even today at the--on the convention floor of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] they have this one piece about how [President Harry S.] Truman desegregated the [U.S.] Army but--
Speaker 2: He missed Key West.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, we're, we're learning something new here (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I'm, I--
Speaker 1: --now this is, all right--
Speaker 2: --I lived there; I'm telling you what I know for a fact, those of us who were black and on the black side of the base because that's exactly what it was.  We went to school in town in Key West through a big gate at the back of the base we went through the hole there wasn't a fence, we went through the hole that's the shortcut.  Now there was a bus that came in to take us the long way around but most of us, with the nice climate, we went through the hole in the back of the fence and we walked to school along with our mothers because our moms, for the most part, stayed home and took care of us because the dads were either off, out to sea or worked right there on the base or whatever, but we did not go to the school that was on the base.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is in 1955--
Speaker 2: Fifty-four [1954], fifty--
Speaker 1: Fifty-four [1954]--
Speaker 2: --five [1955]--
Speaker 1: --fifty-five [1955]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the armed services [U.S. Armed Forces] hadn't been good--hadn't been so-called desegregated long but it didn't reach all the way to Key West (laughter)?
Speaker 2: If it was, it didn't make it in Key West, Florida and the base was Fort [Zachary] Taylor [Key West, Florida], the history's easy to check (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, all right, so, so how long were you in Key West?
Speaker 2: For two and a half years.
Speaker 1: Oh, now did you like school when you were--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, well that like church was not an option, my, my mother [Annabell Jenkins Shands], she did seventh grade as I mentioned before.  But she was probably the smartest woman that I had ever met in my life.  And I was always amazed by the things that she knew and my dad [William Shands] who was a high school graduate would challenge me, that's how I earned those special favors.  Everybody thinks an only child is spoiled, no, you earned it through the A's you brought home, you earned it by being able to recite different pieces of poetry or even the lyrics from songs, which was poetry.  And the learning of blues stories, so that's how I was able to do what I did with my family, earning it, earning it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, so if you earned, if you learned something you would get a financial reward or something?
Speaker 2: I would get a reward of some sort.  Mangoes were at a premium, I mean they were plentiful in Key West, but being able to have them there was a choice.  My mother was very careful with teeth wanting to make sure that I kept all of mine so the sugars were--that was a reward, even the fruit, all of that stuff, so.  And, it worked.
Story_ID: 278277
Speaker 1: Now this was a black school in Key West [Florida] then that you attended (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember any of the teachers there as a--
Speaker 2: I don't remember the teachers from Key West but I do remember the teachers that I got when I went back to Charleston [South Carolina].  I had a woman in the fourth grade who, and this is really bad to say but it's the truth.  Her name was Ms. Taylor [ph.], and I remember her distinctly because she was a no-nonsense kinda person, probably all of 4'10" or [4']11", but with the biggest voice I had ever heard in my life who said that excellence was the only choice to be made and this was a black school as well.  And she told all of us on a daily basis why it was important that we first respected ourselves in order to be able to garner respect from others and in my fourth grade class we called each other mister and miss for the dignity that we did not get outside of that classroom.  And she would greet us in that fashion and understanding the message was made very plain by the lessons that she taught.  She taught us from the books, it's true, but she taught us life lessons.  She was so determined that we would be able to handle ourselves as she described it.  She brought plates and place settings and different utensils to show us how to eat properly in a situation that would be outside of our normal everyday life.  She taught us girls, who were all of nine, how to sit properly and how the young boys were to be of assistance to a lady.  Those things stuck, believe it or not, and I'm not the feminist or certainly not the coquette kind of southerner that relishes in those things, but it gave a cushion of comfort that I could remember when I was more than nine, but when I was nineteen and twenty-nine and thirty-nine and forty-nine.  She just kinda sits right there on that shoulder and says, you know, "Of all things you must be respectful of yourself first in order to garner the respect that comes."  Long story for a very short question, but she was powerful and brilliant, absolutely brilliant.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: So did you--what was the name of your school--
Speaker 2: East Bay Elementary [Sanders-Clyde Elementary, Charleston, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: East Bay, okay so that back to East Bay Elementary, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right, so did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: For, for the girls she insisted that it be math, she said the other stuff would come naturally, she said, "But you gotta learn how to count first of all because you have to be on your own first before you learn to be anything else.  You are you before you become Mrs. Anybody," and that was just different, that was different.  So math, for me, early on was the favorite subject but I think her emphasis on elocution was what kinda stuck for me and it was reinforced by the time I got to high school.  Being able to speak properly and the tag that came with being a Geechee, trying to dance around that one.
Story_ID: 278278
Speaker 1: When did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to high school, let's see if I can count backwards, '62 [1962], yeah, '62 [1962] I guess.  High school was California the first two years and the last three years Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was the name of school you went to in California?
Speaker 2: Port Hueneme High School [Hueneme High School, Oxnard, California].
Speaker 1: Are you saying Port?
Speaker 2: Port Hueneme, H-U-E-N-E-M-E.  We lived on the [U.S.] military base [Naval Base Ventura County, California] but went into Oxnard [California] to go to school.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and so, you started in California, what--was it a--how did you feel about changing so--you know to--about all the new venues of school, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was just geography.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My constant was my family, you know, I didn't care where we were as long as my mother [Annabell Jenkins Shands] and my father [William Shands] didn't disappear, I was good to go.  As an only child it was an adventure to meet new people, but I had my security blanket, I had my parents.  And they worked really hard at making sure I was stable so.
Speaker 1: Now did you spend your summers in South Carolina or did you--
Speaker 2: My summers sometime were spent in South Carolina.  More so after we moved back to the East Coast from California, my tenth, eleventh, and twelfth years I went to South Carolina.  I was staying with my uncle to finish high school, but my mother was building a home for us in Charleston [South Carolina] while my dad was completing his military career.  So I went to Charleston, and that's when I started to do work-work.  I worked when I was in Philadelphia to have my own pocket money and to get away from my uncle some 'cause he was so strict.  But I went home to South Carolina during the summer, worked in plants, worked in sewing factories.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I mean, did you, at that time did you notice a big difference between California and Philadelphia and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Huge.
Speaker 1: --Charleston.
Speaker 2: Huge, like the story of meeting the young boy on my first day on Key West [Florida], going to California I felt an acceptance that was really strange because it just kinda disappeared. The very clear prejudice that was in Florida was numbed a little bit in Charleston because of the genteel way in South Carolina, you knew it was there you understood where it was comin' from but folks were not rude.  And then leaving from there to go to California where folks kinda judged you based on the relationship more than anything else, I'm sure that if I were more aware of what was happening racially then when we first moved out, seventh grade I guess, I would remember it a lot clearer but I wasn't, I was just excited about being in a place that was so beautiful and warm and folks talked funny so it was an opportunity again to learn new things and then coming back to the East Coast where it was a whole lot clearer.
Speaker 1: Okay now--
Speaker 2: Those kinds of transitions were real clear to me.
Story_ID: 278279
Speaker 1: Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], what kind of impression did that make on you?
Speaker 2: Philadelphia was a rude awakening.  I lived on 20th [Street] and Berks [Street] in Philadelphia, that's North Philly [North Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] with my uncle and that was even then very rough.  I had the protected environment of living on a [U.S.] military facility for most of my life because of my stepfather [William Shands], but then I was in the community when I moved to Philadelphia to live with my uncle.  And perhaps that was the reason that he was so strict because I was quite naive and did not have a lot of exposure.  But from my new community and my new surroundings I learned a lot of stuff that kinda charged me to do some stuff that I am doing now.  I had an opportunity to see that everything wasn't fair or equal, and that those that fought for it got it.  And those that fought the hardest were able to keep it and hold on to it.  I learned in Philadelphia that speaking up was absolutely necessary, politeness was not necessarily the best way to go, that there was a requirement to sometimes be impolite in order to survive.  I also learned that it didn't matter what the package was for the learning that if you had the right tools inside, and I had that through a teacher, her name was Daisy Richardson, when I walked into Simon Gratz High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], she chose me to mentor, and I think that if she had not chosen me I would not have survived 'cause she knew that I was both out of my element, scared but stubborn.  All of those things that make it difficult for a newcomer and she was my physical education teacher at the time who later became the principal of Simon Gratz High School, which was the school that I went to.  And she talked to me as if she were my mother [Annabell Jenkins Shands].  My uncle did not have a formal education, could not answer the questions that I had, and when I went to her, because she wouldn't disappear, she took the time to make sure that I understood that I was not gonna be a product of North Philadelphia.  That I was going to be whatever I wanted to be and she hung in there and made a path for me to get to Florida A&M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], which was her alma mater, told me what sorority I was going to pledge, which was Delta [Sigma Theta Sorority], which was hers, and I adored her and I am eternally grateful for the kind of time she gave to me.
Speaker 1: What's her name again?
Speaker 2: Daisy Richardson.  Kept in contact with her until maybe fifteen years ago, I lost touch, did the thing that we all do, guiltily, got busy, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Dynamite sister, smart. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, you were in Philadelphia how long?
Speaker 2: I was in Philadelphia for three years.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Two and a half, three years.
Speaker 1: So did you--but you graduated from high school in Charleston [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: I graduated from high school in Philadelphia (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Philadelphia, so you graduated from Simon Gratz, okay.
Speaker 2: I graduated from Simon Gratz High School.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so that was 1966?
Speaker 2: Sixty-six [1966].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Class of seventy-five [students], '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 278280
Speaker 1: And you said in the summertime, though, you had, you had worked (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I would work in Charleston [South Carolina], um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in, in Charleston, okay.
Speaker 2: Every summer I would go to Charleston.  I worked first at a plant that made pallets, wooden pallets.  My mother [Annabell Jenkins Shands] was working at that plant so I worked wherever she worked.  She ran a saw to cut wood to make pallets for them to lay stock on and to make sure that she could keep her eyes on me every day I went to work with my mother.  Got a job there, I was catching wood from her until I got splinters up my arm and my dad [William Shands] said, "No more," (laughter).  So she purposely made me want to get outta there.  She worked me until I couldn't see straight and she says, "This is your alternative: education, or you do what I do."  And then I started to work at a shirt factory.
Speaker 1: Okay now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the summer.
Speaker 1: --this is the Manhattan Shirt Factory [Charleston, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Manhattan Shirt Factory, how'd you know that?
Speaker 1: I read the bio (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, okay (laughter).  Yeah, I worked at Manhattan Shirt Factory, which was a good job 'cause all my cousins were in there, too.
Speaker 1: This connection between Manhattan [New York, New York] and South Carolina anyway, you know, we all know this but a lot of people in Harlem [New York, New York] come from South Carolina and it's like Mississippi is to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: But Manhattan shirts actually come from South Carolina (laughter).
Speaker 2: Absolutely, yeah they do.
Speaker 1: So, so you're in the Manhattan Shirt Factory.
Speaker 2: I'm in the Manhattan Shirt Factory.
Speaker 1: I mean, when you first encounter organizing, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well there were two women, two Jewish women as a matter of fact, sisters, one was Rosemary Reznicek [ph.], I remember her distinctly and I don't remember her sister's name now, and that's a sign of my crossing over the 5-0 [fifty].  Standing outside the gate passing out leaflets, and my mother said, "Take one of those."  Everybody else was just kinda scooting past it really fast 'cause they were nervous, and momma said, "Take one of those and then I want you to come on let's sit at the table, and you read it to me."  I didn't know that she was doing that to get the audience of people around us to hear what was in the piece. And then she'd say, "Okay, let's talk about this, what do you think they're talkin' about?"  And it was about workers' rights, the right to have a break, the right to be able to go to the bathroom without permission which were not things that were happenin' inside of Manhattan Shirt Factory at the time.  And it also talked about piece rates, which a whole bunch of us did not understand except for those folks who had been up north, and had worked piece rates and gotten paid premium pay.  I think that's what caught my mother's eye and everyday we'd take the leaflet and every day my mother would have me read it at the table and every day more and more people would come.  And then, got to a point where supervisors started to get a little bit ticked off about the audience that collected at the lunchroom's tables even though it was before work and sometimes at lunch time, which was off work time and my mom had to take him on in dialogue, and she got fired, but every morning she brought me to work and every morning I read those leaflets to our folks and my mother was there until the clock, when the buzzer went off, she'd do her little, "See ya later," and she'd be back at lunch.  So, she was determined, and she made sure that I didn't back-up, but, she was pretty good at getting me fired but she was also pretty good at teaching me how to stand up, so.  But that was every single summer, and on the second summer at Manhattan Shirt Factory we were successful.  We got enough votes in order to get the union in.  At the time it was Amalgamated Clothing Workers [of America; UNITE HERE] that organized the plant, and she asked them, "Well, if she wanted to work for this union what would you do?"  And she said, "We'd hire her."  She said, "Okay, when she finishes her education I'm going to send her to you," (laughter).  And she did, she did.
Story_ID: 278281
Speaker 1: Were you in clubs [at Simon Gratz High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and that--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Pretty athletic because I'm a big girl, captain of the volleyball team, captain of the softball team.  It was mostly sports, I wish I could say I was a part of all of the academic groups, but no, I was not.  I was a majorette, cheerleader for a very short time, couldn't quite get that split thing working right (laughter) so--
Speaker 1: Well that's tough to do, right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I don't blame you--
Speaker 2: --it's tough to do (laughter).
Speaker 1: --I don't, I don't fault anybody for that.
Speaker 2: But that--those were the kinds of clubs that I was in, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay now, were you, were you an academic star in, in high school?
Speaker 2: I maintained a B+ average because Daisy Richardson would not let me do any of the other stuff if I didn't.  So, it wasn't that I was pressed to do it by my own volition it was because I had folks like my mom [Annabell Jenkins Shands] and like her that insisted that it happened.  And she made it real clear to me that without the grades I was not going to A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and that was just not acceptable to her.  So, I got the grades and I got into A&M.
Story_ID: 278282
Speaker 1: In high school [Simon Gratz High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], you were prepared to do what Ms. [Daisy] Richardson had outlined for you had already; she already had the path set for you to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --go to Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], become a Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority], you know, and your mother [Annabell Jenkins Shands] said you were gonna work for the union [Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACWA); UNITE HERE], and so (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, I'm obedient--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to people I respect.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which is definitely a criteria; there is not a go along to get along attitude here at all.  Respect, I think, is something that you must earn and both of these women, my mom and Ms. Richardson, the respect was instant.  My mom could punish me, but choose not to. My mother talked to me and sometimes I think the talking to when I misbehaved was worse than any whipping I could have ever gotten because you could see the disappointment in her face, and more than anything else I wanted to please her because I respected her that much.  And Ms. Richardson was the same kind of sister.  She would look at me and ask me, "What were you thinking?"  And that would be enough to send me into a tailspin because then I knew that I had done something totally stupid that she thought was way outside of what she thought (laughter) I was qualified to do.  And it's that kind of accountability that became very important to me early on with the people I respected.  If there's no respect, you know, you have to do a whole lot to get me to do something, but if I respect you then I hear you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So were you considered--did you have any discipline issues in school at all?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I had a lot of mouth. I would engage in debate very easily because your saying so does not make it so.
Speaker 1: With teachers?
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Both of the people that I respected charged me with that responsibility.  If you don't understand it, challenge it until someone makes you understand.  And if you understand that your understanding is wrong, be big enough to say, "Okay, I've got it, it wasn't clear to me, or I was wrong in what I was thinking."  But make them make it correct in your mind.
Story_ID: 278283
Speaker 1: You know, that behavior is often frowned on in school.  I know today I've, I've heard, you know, stories where people frown on children asking, or teenagers asking questions in class, good questions and, you know, just the fact that they're asking the question seems to be--to offend authority often especially--and in those days, in '66 [1966], it was probably even more so. Did you really have to think about, "Am I going to challenge this," or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not for a minute because I knew if there was ever a discussion about having done something that was considered disrespectful to authority, I had a cushion to fall on.  I had a teacher [Daisy Richardson] that trusted me in what I attempted to do, I had a mother [Annabell Jenkins Shands] that believed in me and I had an opportunity to explain to both of them why I did what I did even if it was outside of what authority said I should be doing.  And they most times agreed with what I had done, but if they didn't they were very quick to say so.  My father [William Shands], whose displeasure with me sent me into a total tailspin, didn't ever involve a hit or a scream, it involved just looking at me and saying, "I'm very disappointed."  So I had the absolute benefit of folks who understood that they could communicate with me through words to challenge me to think, so I've not ever been afraid of making mistakes, not ever.  A mistake is an opportunity to learn something better and different.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I had no fear in that regard.
Story_ID: 278284
Speaker 1: Are there any stories and literature or movies or TV shows that inspired you, or helped your development as a, you know, as a person that confronts authority and--
Speaker 2: Well, TV was not a huge part of what I had.  There was television in the house but there was more music than there was TV and the stories that I got came out of the stories that were told through song.  Blues will tell you a whole bunch and it's beyond the, "Oh Lord, he broke my heart," this kinda thing but it talked about strength a lot and a good number of those songs, which is why I guess I like Billie Holiday a lot.  And why I like Etta James a lot, on its surface it sounds like she's talking about unrequited love or whatever, but she's talkin' about her own determination to survive.  The same was true with Billie Holiday, in spite of all of her own problems she talked about the importance of strength.  She talked about the importance of her own decisions and took it--took full responsibility for the things that she did through her songs, whether it was, oh, and that happens to my brain when I try to remember songs in particular, but from 'The Silver Collection' she does a version of "Moonlight In Vermont," or "Moonlight Over Vermont," [sic.] or whatever the heck it's called, I just know that there's several lines within the song that speaks to her determination to be who she was in spite of the relationship that was there.  And Etta James describing the kind of feeling that she wanted for herself through a Sunday kinda love and sayin' what wasn't acceptable. To me, that's a strong person, that wasn't, "Oh Lord, he done left me again." It wasn't about that at all it was about a woman who thought about how she wanted her own being to be reflected in a relationship.  The books, 'Five Smooth Stones[: A Novel,' Ann Fairbairn], I'm trying to remember the author now, I can't. The standards, [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou's poetry.  Trying to be deep again like my Miles Davis period, which didn't quite work 'cause some of that stuff was quite confusing, but the discipline in reading it and trying to understand it was what helped, so, yeah.  Some of that was there, but TV was not a big part of it.
Story_ID: 278285
Speaker 1: Bad experience at a movie--let me just kinda step to the left for a second.  In Charleston [South Carolina], at the Gloria Theatre [Sottile Theatre], I remember this clearly, I couldn't have been--I guess I was about nine, 'cause it was not long after we came back from Florida.  Black folks sat up stairs in the balcony, white folks sat on the first floor.  There was a matinee that only cost a nickel.  We'd pay our nickel downstairs with everybody else and then had to go up the steps, up the back steps to get to the balcony to watch the movies.  It wasn't about the movies; you know what it was about? Being in that movie and taking the popcorn and flinging it over the top to engage (laughter) in dialogue with folks from the first floor, and then meeting folks outside having a conversation instead of a fight.  Because if the adults weren't around the conversation is what happened, if they were around they would egg on the fight.  So black kids and white kids choose to engage in that exchange, 'cause they would look and wait for the popcorn to fall, and it wasn't about what was on the screen it was about, "Yeah, you have to sit up there."  "Yeah, but we like where we're sitting," you know it's that kind of thing.  And then outside, "Did you see anything different than what we saw?  Was the popcorn any different?  How much was your soda?  I know how much mine was."  That kind of exchange and then laughing about silly things 'cause they would pick fun at those who had gotten hit by popcorn, we never threw soda, but the dry popcorn went down.  Or those who got a whole bag of popcorn pitched on the head, and we'd laugh at them but with them.  They'd tease us about certain things but that kind of exchange was preparing for the debate after the movie.  The movie was irrelevant.  It was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's interesting--
Speaker 1: --the conversation that--
Speaker 2: --that's interesting dynamic--
Speaker 1: --was afterwards.  But I remember that--
Speaker 2: I don't think I've ever heard this dynamic explained like that and maybe it--is it because of Charleston, the nature of Charleston you think or--
Speaker 1: Could be, could be--
Speaker 2: 'Cause I've heard some people get really angry about the movie experience, you know, and--
Speaker 1: Well, the only thing that turned it nasty or ugly was when the grown-ups were around, when some of the parents came and picked their kids up in their fancy station wagon, and to me and my child, mine the station wagon that had the wood paneling along the side was a real fancy machine to me.  But then guess what, the white kids that were down there didn't bother with the fancy white kids either.  The dialogue happened among those of us who had things in common.
Story_ID: 278286
Speaker 1: Now was Charleston [South Carolina] a city, I know it was segregated, but was there like a clear black side of town or--
Speaker 2: Still is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Still is. Across the Ashley [River], although it's integrated some, which is upscale, it's still pretty much black in some sections, white is--downtown on the Battery [Charleston, South Carolina], almost exclusively, although there are some blacks who have wonderful homes there.  North Charleston [South Carolina] almost exclusively black the poverty areas are clearly outlined and redlined.  And the outlining communities where folks have actually had an opportunity to earn some money reflects more of the integration than anything else but those too are separated. Churches are still, clearly, the most separated segment of our community.  I don't know of one church in Charleston where blacks and whites attend church together, and I go home often.  For that fact I don't know of any in New York [New York].  I've not attended any in New York where blacks and whites go to church together, either.
Speaker 1: There's a few like Riverside [Church, New York, New York] and that sort of thing I think but--
Speaker 2: Well, I live in Queens [New York, New York], work in Manhattan [New York], but live in Queens.  And in Queens it's, even Reverend Flag's [ph.] church is solidly black; my church, St. Albans Baptist [Church, Jamaica, Queens, New York, New York], solidly black, and folks go there for that fuel because we can talk about stuff as a people and share the hurt and the joy in a way that is pretty cool.  Not that anyone is excluded, but that's a community of comfort.

Speaker 1: Well tell us about Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU), Tallahassee, Florida] now, you graduated from Simon Gratz [High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in '66 [1966], you went off to Florida A&M, and did anything happen that summer that we need to talk about or did--
Speaker 2: What when I went away to school?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the summer before you went away or--
Speaker 2: Well, I told you my uncle who is no longer with us was very strict so it was like being released from Sing Sing [Correctional Facility, Ossining, New York], and the idea of being in a place that I didn't have a gatekeeper was absolutely romantic to me (laughter).  Not for the romance side of it, but for the freedom side of it.  I graduated at 12:30 that afternoon, my mom [Annabell Jenkins Shands] pulled up in her little white [Ford] Thunderbird and a U-Haul trailer behind it, packed me up and we were on that road by 7:30 that night headed for South Carolina and four days later I was headed to FAMU.  Because I got started early in the summer program, Ms. [Daisy] Richardson took care of that to make sure that I could get acquainted with being away from home and being on my own, because she knew that I honestly did not know how to do that.  When I got to FAMU, the size of the school was mind-blowing.  My universe had been relatively small and A&M's campus to me had been the largest place that I ever operated independently in my life.  I was seventeen years old, I thought I was grown until I got there, and when my mother turned and walked away from me out of that dormitory I thought I was gonna have a heart attack and got violently sick there she ended up staying an extra day.  But at that school there was a mentor, Eva [C.] Wanton, who was mentors for the Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority].
Speaker 1: How do you spell her last name?
Speaker 2: W-A-N-T-O-N.  Who stepped over to me and said, "I know you're frightened, just know that I'm here."  I'd never seen her before in my life, did not know that she was a Delta, and even thought Ms. Richardson had talked to me about a sorority, I didn't have a clear mind set about what it really was.  But she had called ahead, once I had gotten accepted at A&M and asked this soror, who became a very good friend of mine later, to kind of look out for me, 'cause she knew that I was fragile, scared and sometimes very stupid and she was there the day that I checked into the freshmen dormitory.  And she was there when my mother was saying goodbye.  So I didn't know that that was my safety net then, but I later found out that she would be.
Story_ID: 278288
Speaker 1: Now what did you major in at Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]?
Speaker 2: Secondary education and physical education.  Ms. [Daisy] Richardson was a P.E teacher; I wanted to be her (laughter).
Speaker 1: And so you--did you--what sports did you play?
Speaker 2: I played softball, I played volleyball, I learned to swim--I swim all the time.  I learned to play golf a little bit; I played tennis with a passion for about twelve years.  Those were the things that I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, women's sports in those days wasn't as big as it is now, but--
Speaker 2: But that was the school of Althea Gibson.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So it had a whole 'nother kinda feel on A&M's campus.  Women were respected who were athletes at A&M. Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, good, I know Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] had a tradition of female athletes and Florida A&M as well I guess, yeah.  Now Florida A&M always had that band, too, that--
Speaker 2: Marching 100, the Rattlers, yeah.  The best sounding band then, now and always will be.
Speaker 1: Well they achieved national attention around that time--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --on, you know, national TV, they were on the big pro football games--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --they played, I mean their marching style kinda revolutionized the--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, Jake Gaither was phenomenal, gosh; I'm trying to think of Bob's last name, played football for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Hayes--
Speaker 2: Bob Hayes--
Speaker 1: Bullet Bob Hayes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, that was his senior year when I went there, when I went in as a freshman all of the [Orange Blossom] Classics in Miami [Florida], we were winning everything so it was like walking in the wonderland.  A&M was wide open in the '60s [1960s] it was the school to be at.  Academically, folks were excelling, there were dollars at the school for a HBC [Historically Black College], which is very important.  There were dollars coming into the school because of all the notoriety that went with folks who were attending, so we had a really, pretty good cushion.  And then my sophomore year Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] came on campus, and Lord, I thought I had died and gone to heaven when I went to (laughter) the rally, because here was man speaking truth to power and radicalism like I had never heard before.  Afros were pumping and black power was the sign of the day, and James Brown was hollering, "I'm black and I'm proud," and I was feeling good as a dark-skinned sister for the first time in a long time.  So it was, it was the time to be in college.  I loved every second of it, feeling that independence and freedom, but with a focus, grabbing something that would give me something to stay focused with, and trying to stay grown up at seventeen and, shortly thereafter, eighteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's a good time.
Speaker 1: It sounds like it (laughter).
Speaker 2: It was a good time, it was.
Story_ID: 278289
Speaker 1: Did you have favorite courses in school [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] that--or a favorite class?
Speaker 2: Well, folks think of physical education majors and minors as folks who just play games, but there are lots of sciences connected.  Anatomy, physiology was kicking my butt, but for the first time in my academic life there was a hands-on experimenting with learning.  I married a cat, named her Samantha [ph.], to learn all of her organs and veins and everything else.  We stole our cadavers of the cats brought them to the dormitory, formaldehyde stunk up Truth Hall to all be damned.  But it was that kind of hands on learning that got me really excited about what university learning was all about, and the requirement to do it on your own, 'cause teachers didn't care whether you did the work or not if you were not prepared you were embarrassed on the campus of A&M when you walked to class.  No one was going to call you at night and say, "It's time for you to do your homework," or, "It's time for you to study."  The first four weeks of school was a real proving ground, whether or not those folks are held as mentors really stuck in my brain and my phone rang constantly.  I was called downstairs, 'cause we didn't have phones in our rooms then, I was called downstairs constantly someone was calling me to check, "Did you study? Did you get your papers done? Where are you? What's going on? Tell me about what you're learning," and that was my mother [Annabell Jenkins Shands], that was Ms. [Daisy] Richardson, Eva [C.] Wanton, who was there on campus, began to take on that role and that was the yardstick, so.  But I was very excited about the other stuff.  Aretha Franklin was kicking The Supremes were singing stuff and looking pretty and all of us wanted to be one of them, preferably Diana [Ross].  There were dances that were happening at the time that you did not need a partner for so the whole thing about being an independent female and being able to get on the floor and do the Madison Shuffle or [Electric] Slide or whatever was saying, "Okay, if I want to dance I don't have to wait for nobody to ask me, I can do this dance, and do it, and still have a good time."  So all of those bits and pieces of freedom came at seventeen, eighteen.  And figuring out what to grab onto was the tough part.
Story_ID: 278290
Speaker 1: Was there a black student organization formed on campus [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], I don't know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We were all black students (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know. So, it's--that's why I asked kind of, in a quizzical kind of way, 'cause I know some black college campuses it was necessary to have a black student organization, you know, on some level to focus on black history and culture and those kind of questions--and on some others it wasn't, you know.
Speaker 2: No, there really wasn't at A&M, there was an SGA, Student Government Association, of course, but I think that's why the [National] Pan-Hellenic [Council (NPHC)] groups were so important to a number of us because it was through those organizations, those sororities, those fraternities that we were exposed to the history, the culture and the current events kind of preparation that went on, because Delta's [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] role is to serve and in serving we wanted to be community activist we wanted to be politically correct, we wanted to do all of those things so that we could outshine the others as well.  But that's where the learning took place because we had folk who were activists in the movement but were also academics on the campus that served us by way of mentoring, guidance and training.
Story_ID: 278291
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers [at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] that stand out in terms of, you know, shaping your political view of the world and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Eva [C.] Wanton, she was buck wild crazy, first time she said, "Well you guys have to get up at four o'clock." We didn't know what for, and it was a group of twelve of us and she says, "We're gonna go downtown to Tallahassee [Florida] to participate in a march."  I didn't call my mother [Annabell Jenkins Shands], I didn't tell Ms. [Daisy] Richardson, I didn't tell anybody, I figure if she said it then I could trust it.  But there was a dispute in downtown Tallahassee that happened at a lunch counter, actually, wasn't a Woolworth [F.W. Woolworth Company], I'm trying to remember.  It was a five and dime downtown Tallahassee and it was during the time that some of the other demonstrations were happening around the country and we were told to dress very nicely, and we did.  We walked into the store, sat down, she ordered, we didn't and we just waited to be refused, and we just sat there for three and a half hours and folks acted like we were a piece of furniture, but that was okay.  When we left, we claimed victory regardless.  I don't know what we won except that we didn't (laughter) go to jail and we didn't get booted out, we sat there.  So, but that's--and then she started to talk to us, that's how Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] came on campus and we got a chance to meet number of other folks, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you know any of the, any people involved in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], or, or, SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference], or that, you know?
Speaker 2: SCLC, I'm trying to remember who it was that came to our campus.  But there were two folk that came from SCLC that came to our campus, and that came with a brother from SNCC.  There were no women with them, which was a part of the turn off for us because we never saw a female in the leadership role that came from these folks.  Now Stokely was cute, so us sisters rolled up out there (laughter) to see him, but we were always demanding, "Where are the women in the movement? I know that there is a sister with a brain somewhere that's an activist that has a voice that is a speaker why don't you guys bring her?"  So when the, the folk came from SCLC, there were two of them, and the one guy from SNCC, we just did not go because they did not have a female and they weren't interested in us, if I'm gonna tell you the truth.  They were actually mobilizing brothers.  But there were some sisters who were from the hometowns of the folk that came in that were active with them, and we just choose not to do it, 'cause we were taking the position that they needed to bring women out.
Story_ID: 278292
Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduating [from Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], you know, did you know what you were going to do?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I thought I was going to teach but I did not do that.  Mama [Annabell Jenkins Shands] asked me, "Do you remember about the trade union movement, is that something that you're interested in?"  I fell in love and got married and my husband [Alfred Brown] was going to New York [New York], and that's where the Rezniceks [ph.] were from, New York, and that's where the Amalgamated Clothing Workers [of America (ACWA); UNITE HERE] were, New York.  I went to the Amalgamated Clothing Workers, knocked on the door, said, "My mom told me that you said that you would hire me once I got out of school."  And they said, "What do you want do?"  And I says, "I want to organize."  'Cause that's what I did and that's all I knew and they didn't have women organizers.  These were two sisters that basically had gone down to South Carolina, ran into this [Manhattan] Shirt Factory [Charleston, South Carolina] who were white, and had organized the plant, but they had no black females on staff and did not want to hire me.  A block and a half up from them was the Textile Workers Union of America [TWUA; UNITE HERE], I walked myself right down that street, I knocked on their door and said, "I want a job."  And I was fortunate, God has been good throughout my entire life, and I got a job with the Textile Workers, and those two unions later merged, the old Textile Workers Union of America and the old Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America merged to become a union called ACTWU [Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union; UNITE HERE], and I got a chance to say to the folks from the Amalgamated Clothing Workers at a point later on, "How you like me now?" (laughter), you know, so.  But it was, it was interesting because there were no black women in the field doing the work that I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: So this was about 1970?
Speaker 2: This was 1970.
Story_ID: 278293
Speaker 1: When [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] died, can you remember what happened on campus [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and what you were doing?
Speaker 2: I remember specifically where I was and what I was doing when [President John Fitzgerald] Kennedy was shot.  When Dr. King died, I think we were all sitting, it was after a game actually, it was after a game on campus and we were all sitting at the SGA [Student Government Association], the, the, the student government, like snack shop thingy, nobody believed it.  It took a whole day for folks to believe that he had actually been shot.  It really--I know that sounds crazy but it took a whole day for us to believe that he had been killed.  'Cause nobody thought that anyone would have the audacity to kill him, 'cause there was that kinda power that came from him that attacking him just didn't seem like something that anybody would do, not even in these here Americas.
Story_ID: 278294
Speaker 1: Amalgamated Clothing Workers [of America (ACWA); UNITE HERE]--now what, now you, you served as an organizer for them?
Speaker 2: I was organizing for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers, actually for Textile Workers Union of America [TWUA; UNITE HERE], 'cause Amalgamated Clothing Workers did not hire me when I first went to them.  I walked down the street to get that job at the TWUA and Sol Stetin was the president then, and he's just passed away he was ninety-three, he just passed away, good friend, became a mentor during the course of working for the union.  They did--they, too, did not have African American women in the field organizing so I told my mother [Annabell Jenkins Shands], I said, "I can't work for them" and she was like, "Well you do something else until you can do that."  So I became a claims adjuster for them.  The--that's when coordination of benefits first became the rage of the day, matching couples insurance to see who was gonna pay first, or that kind of piece.  And they had a new plant that had just been organized down south in Alabama and I was a southerner and I could read, write and figure out stuff pretty good because of A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], so I got sent to Opelika, Alabama, to institute a new program called a coordination of benefits program, and there were a number of other plants in the area, so I took advantage of that opportunity to engage in the organizing campaign that was going on while I was supposed to be doing the intakes for the coordination of benefits.  A two-day trip turned into a three and a half week trip because I got involved in the campaign and had a good time there.
Speaker 1: Now did they teach you how to organize, I mean did they, they teach you union (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother taught me how to organize.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But there is a, learn by fire method, that was prevalent in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s] and even into the '80s [1980s] now we have organizing institutes that are really pretty good to teach folks how to do certain kinds of things better, so.
Speaker 1: I know you--how out of union organizing came like a Saul Alinsky style organizer and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --then the civil rights organizer--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --also, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, the Saul Alinsky technique was a part of what we learned in, God, I guess mid-'70s [1970s], early '80s [1980s].  The community-based strategies and reaching out to the other kinds of coalition partners that were of like mind, and the confrontational kind of piece so that you could think through what was the best vantage point for self-interest.  So yeah the Alinsky method was absolutely shared.  We worked with a group of organizers out of Texas who were the teachers of the Saul Alinsky method.  I don't know if that's common, but that came from the religious sector, and that was after I had had the opportunity to work in Opelika, Alabama, because I was officially a claims adjuster (laughter) and did not get to do the organizing piece until the J.P. Stevens [& Company] campaign.  And that was in Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina that I got the assignment and got to do some work.  But even with that, the organizing that I did was connected with my teaching skills because secondary education was my second major. So I was able to do shop stewards training and training around recognition for brown lung, the OSHA [Occupational Safety and Health Administration] pieces were becoming more and more a part of the organizing efforts so recognizing that and getting people fired up about how it is that they could insist on rights to protect their health was one that gave me a niche to operate on, so.  That's what I did.
Story_ID: 278295
Speaker 1: Are there any good stories from those days?
Speaker 2: From the organizing days (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah. What's the toughest part of it, you know, in those days?
Speaker 2: Being away from home, my son [Alfred Brown, Jr.] was born in '74 [1974] and I went to start working on the J.P. Stevens [& Company] campaign when he was seven weeks old and my husband [Alfred Brown] was not warm and fuzzy about the idea about going back to work so soon so, you know how young love is, he said, "Well hey if you go, take the baby."  So, in those days we had those backpack thingies that had the metal strap over your shoulders, being my mother's [Annabel Jenkins Shands] daughter I put that backpack on, dropped my baby in the back grabbed my grip and off I went 'cause we drove.  So I did the trip to Roanoke Rapids [North Carolina] and that lasted all of three days and he showed up in Roanoke Rapids and said, "Give me my son," (laughter).  And, that was the kind of trust that developed in my marriage over the years for how we would share the responsibility that came with the marriage and I was lucky.  I got someone who was, after a couple of years, was no longer a traditional thinker about what roles were what male, female roles were.  We worked that out and we will be married thirty--well we just made thirty-seven years, so, that's pretty cool.
Speaker 1: That is a good thing, you know--
Speaker 2: It's pretty cool.
Speaker 1: --doesn't always happen like that so--
Speaker 2: No.  I don't know if we make thirty-eight, but right now I got thirty-seven of 'em (laughter) okay, yeah.
Story_ID: 278296
Speaker 1: The J.P. Stevens [& Company] campaign was a campaign to build a union in the (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, J. P. Stevens had plants in almost all of the southern cities, North Carolina, South Carolina in particular.  I wanted to be involved because of the plants that were in South Carolina, but of course I got the assignment in North Carolina, 'cause South Carolina would have gotten me closer to home, my mother [Annabell Jenkins Shands], you know, the issues with childcare and all the rest of it.  But, the workers at J. P. Stevens could not take a bathroom break unless there was permission granted, were working in conditions that caused brown lung and black lung--
Speaker 1: These are furniture plants or something (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No this is a--
Speaker 1: What is J. P. Steven--
Speaker 2: It's a towel manufacturer, linen manufacturer, rugs, you know, that kind of thing, it's a textile plant.  And workers basically had very few rights in that, in that, in that plant.
Speaker 1: What caused brown lung?
Speaker 2: The fiber from the cotton because they processed it from the very beginning to the actual finished product.  When the cotton came in they came in raw from the fields. There was a room called the picking room where it actually went into a machine that picked the filth from it, the spuds, the flint, the stems, the whole nine and separated it out and softened it so that it could be spun into thread or cord before it could be woven, and blacks traditionally worked in that first end of the production, so a lot of the African Americans that were in the plant were victims of brown lung and black lung.  The filament fibers would attach itself to the lungs.  You would see people who lived in Roanoke Rapids [North Carolina] and the surrounding community walking around with oxygen tanks or with the tracheotomies, even their tracheal tubes hanging out because they could no longer breathe.  There were many workers who could no longer sleep lying in a bed but slept in a chair because it was the only way that they could get air into their lungs in order to breathe during the course of the night.  And it was because of that kind of struggle that they were engaged in that I certainly wanted to be there, and because a lot of those workers looked like me.  And J.P. Stevens was a natural, had to be there--
Story_ID: 278297
Speaker 1: Was it hard to agitate people around there [Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina]--the interest in--
Speaker 2: No, I think I had a plus because I came out of a factory [Manhattan Shirt Factory, Charleston, South Carolina] myself, so it wasn't, you know, someone that was just going to workers asking them to take on a challenge that they had never faced themselves.  I remind you that my mother [Annabell Jenkins Shands] would step out there in a heartbeat; she didn't care if she got fired and brought me along with her in the firing process.  But I learned from the process that dignity and respect was even more important than that paycheck at the end of the week 'cause there was gonna be another job.  Times are a whole lot different than they are now, options were a lot more plentiful.  There was an industrial base here; there were entry-level jobs here, so folks could stand up for their rights knowing that they could get another job unlike a lot of the situations here today.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) that's probably--do you--are you saying that that's why--well, you know, the unions have been under attack since the [President Ronald Wilson] Reagan administration, I mean under real, you know--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --attack, you know.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And, you know, have lost, I think a lot of ground and in the South where we should have a lot of unions we don't have as many and it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I think it's not just that unions have lost ground I think American workers have lost opportunities because a good share of the entry-level jobs, most definitely in the South, but also in what was considered our industrial base states, are no longer there.  The industrialized states of the Midwest are now just a pure out Rust Belt, 'cause you see factory after factory that's closed down.  I mean, even the solid ones; folks went to Detroit [Michigan] to work because there was GM [General Motors Corporation], Ford [Motor Company, Dearborn, Michigan], Chrysler [Corporation; FCA US LLC, Auburn Hills, Michigan] you, you name it, there was a good paying job with some benefits attached to that part of the country.  Now you have plants that are closing at two and three thousand workers strong on a daily basis.  So, the entry-level jobs that went with having achieved the one criteria that we gave folk in the American dream: "Stay outta trouble, finish school and you will have a job where you can maintain your level of dignity and respect."  We can't offer that any longer because those jobs are not there, they're just not there.  Technological jobs were supposed to be the wave of the future because we were all supposed to be going to college; you know that's not true like I do.  Not everybody is going to go to college, not everybody should go to college because that's not where their interest is but that does not mean that they should not be able to work and earn a decent wage or have a decent life where they can take care of themselves and their families.  We don't have that entry any longer for folks to make those choices, and even those who do the second step, get the college degree, those technology--technological jobs are offshore now.
Story_ID: 278298
Speaker 1: How did the [J.P.] Stevens [& Company] campaign turn out?
Speaker 2: We [Textile Workers Union of America (TWUA); Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU)] won, but it took us seventeen years to do it.  All those workers did get a union contract, they got back pay in huge numbers, folks lived pretty well for quite a while and then that company did what has become the norm for a number of companies in the U.S. now.  When they could not get the cheap labor here, they started shutting down the operations and moving it offshore, and you're hard pressed to find towels and sheets and pillow cases that still are made here in America.  The company merged with other companies and the last merger resulted in Fieldcrest-Cannon [Corporation] and you might remember that two and a half, three years ago more than seven thousand workers lost their jobs because they closed up shop and went to the new land of opportunity, offshore production.  Not just the traditionals, but they ventured off into Vietnam, which is cheap labor, the Philippines and a number of other countries to produce it so.
Speaker 1: Okay so after seventeen years of struggle that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's pretty disrespectful, I think.
Story_ID: 278299
Speaker 1: What did you do next, I mean after that campaign?
Speaker 2: Well, J.P. Stevens [& Company] afforded me an opportunity to learn, not the company, but the opportunity to work on the organizing campaign. To learn how to do organizing in a more effective way, but it also sharpened my skills for teaching, teaching workers doing worker education.  So, with that I had an opportunity then to become the associate director for the newly merged union because in '75 [sic. 1976], the Amalgamated Clothing Workers [of America (ACWA)] and the Textile Workers Union [of America (TWUA)] merged [to form Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU); UNITE HERE], and with that merger, and the resources that were available, there was an opportunity then to really take on Stevens, organize them and win, develop programs that would help to develop workers to become stronger independent wage earners, and I became the associate director of education that not only talked about workers' rights and how to bargain and how to file grievances and fight for your rights in the workplace, but to develop opportunities that spoke to survival outside of that workplace.  We were able to get grants to do non-traditional training.  And as a female, especially a sister female, that was important to me, because most of the jobs as they were categorized as ethnic jobs in some of the locations in those mills.  There were also jobs that were deemed women's work and men's work.  Men's work, guess what, got paid a whole lot more.  But when we were able to do some Title VII grant stuff, we got some dollars so that women could learn how to become fixers in the plant, to fix the machinery that was there.  How to drive some of the heavy equipment, and to do a number of things that got them more dollars so I was able to do that kinda training and--for five years--and then education director after that.
Speaker 1: Okay so, so this takes us to, let's see, so '5 [1975]--this is, this takes us to, I guess, to the '80s [1980s], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: Quick jumps (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, well it's not, not, I know this is a lot of work (laughter).
Speaker 2: It's a lot of work.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: It is a lot of work, but when you're having--when you enjoy your work it just seems like it goes very fast.

Speaker 1: What are the qualities do you think somebody has to have to work with--to organize people around labor issues and, I mean, to really be effective at it, you know?
Speaker 2: They've got to respect people and respect the work that they do as having some value.  The minute you are perceived by the workers that you're talking to as being dishonest or disrespectful, you're dead.  You are absolutely dead, and you should be.  You should be.  That's why my belief is that workers organizing workers is far more effective than a fancy, designed program or style of organizing to convince people to do something.  Folk know what's best, what's in their self-interest.  They understand an adherent better when it comes from somebody that's been there and done that.  And I think that workers who have an opportunity to organize other workers do it far more effectively than--
Speaker 1: Than somebody, for instance, saying that they've been to college and now they're gonna tell them how to (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --do it, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm college-educated, but that certainly does not put me as smarter than the workers who were actually running that machine every day.
Speaker 1: So it's that connection with--
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And understanding the dignity of work, or lack thereof, that they face very single moment.  Because you should not have to lay down your social or civil rights the moment you walk through a plant door--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --because you're going to get a paycheck at the end of the week, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now what, what's the opposition like, you know, what kinds of people come to the fore to oppose, you know, union organize and workers benefits, even from the ranks, I know from the top there's a lot of opposition, but what--
Speaker 2: Well, from the rank and file, it's usually those who are ascribers to the crab mentality, wanting to get to the top at anybody's expense and holding them down the minute you rise they pull you down.  Or people who are just flat out scared. From the professional side those who are very good at frightening folk or threatening folk, or just pulling on that plantation mentality, which seems to work even in the 2000s plus.  Which is a very scary thing to realize, "I've been good to you, and why do you need somebody from the outside to interfere with what we're doing?" You'd be amazed at how many people believe that still.
Story_ID: 278301
Speaker 1: Is religion an ally or--for the, for [union] organizers these days or--
Speaker 2: I would say sometimes, sometimes.  Certain sectors of the country, if you do not have a good solid faith, or relationship with the religious community, you can't get in.  In others, it does not matter, depending on the region of the country that you're in, the sector of a particular state that you're in, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, what about party politics it seems that--to me that there aren't--it's only, you know, they're very few--I don't, I never heard of a Republican union supporter, but I guess--I don't, you know--
Speaker 2: Oh, there are (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) are there any?
Speaker 2: --there are several.
Speaker 1: Are there? Okay.
Speaker 2: Arlen Specter, who was a champion for workers' rights, I know that's scary, 'cause he's a Republican out of Pennsylvania, who basically is a decent human being that stands on the principal of what's right and when workers are in a challenging position in the State of Pennsylvania he has stood many a time.  Not all the time, but many a time on the side of right.  And some of our good strong Democrats show shaky from time to time a lot more this time and the next time than time-to-time, but I don't think that the parties are clearly defined as to who's pro-union and non-union.  I think that folk are compromised a lot by who it is that supports them in their home jurisdiction or through their constituency that they profess to be serving.  But anytime that you do not speak up for the folks who are workers in your constituency, I don't think you deserve to hold that seat.
Story_ID: 278302
Speaker 1: What did you do next?
Speaker 2: I went on to do--I lead one of our [Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU)] affiliates for about thirteen years as its manager and director; it was the laundry industry [laundry division].  I ran for an office inside the union, became a vice president.  Handled a broader scope of the civil rights activities being able to frame it to reflect a little bit more of where my principles on civil rights come from.  I was elected to the executive council of the AFL-CIO [American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations], along with John Sweeney during his transitioning of making the federation, the national organization, more reflective of the workers that work among our rank and file.  And in the last year, last few months, got elected as the president of the A. Philip Randolph Institute [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay, now as a, as a black woman involved in union activity, I mean, how, I mean, had there been white women ahead of you that were the first women or did you--had to be both at certain (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sometimes.
Speaker 1: Sometimes--
Speaker 2: Sometimes and sometimes I'm the only, which is not, you know, any great source of pride or comfort because I think that if you break a ceiling of any kind, especially a woman, especially an African American woman, there's a responsibility to pull somebody with you, certainly somebody behind you.  But with you is better because you then have someone to learn with during the process 'cause it's all brand new territory.  Like I said to you, they had not had an African American female in the field organizing.  They had white women, but not a lot of those either.  I was the first African American woman on our executive council of our own international union.  I think being the only just makes you an easier target.  You can be proud for a minute but pride is something that you have no luxury in, if you really are about the business of growing, you go, "Oh yeah, I did that," you know, or, "It was made possible for me to do that, now how do I pay that back," you gotta pull somebody with you.  And I'm lucky; I'm joined by some dynamic sisters on my board, well, one in particular, name is Jean Hervey, dynamite sister out of Arkansas.
Story_ID: 278303
Speaker 1: You serve on quite a few boards, I was looking at--when I was lookin' at your resume, I mean, it's quite a few boards, you know, corporate boards and how do you find the time, I guess (laughter), for all of it, I mean, it's--
Speaker 2: Well I'm an only child, and I have an only child, and my son [Alfred Brown, Jr.] is thirty-two years old now.  But because I always worked he did not have a stay-at-home mom, not on a daily basis.  He didn't have a soccer mom, he didn't have that.  What he had was parents who made them a part--made him a part of their lives and nurtured him in our own way.  I was blessed, I had a husband [Alfred Brown] who loved being the primary caregiver for our son and they, to this day, have a bond that is just impenetrable.  But you just have to be willing to get up in the morning and stay up late at night and listen to people that are smarter, and that's not always someone with a title, but listening to the folks that you're doing work with and for in order to be able to do a number of things.  I came to the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] as a result of two very good brothers, Bill Lucy [HistoryMaker William Lucy] being one of them, and [HistoryMaker] Richard [G.] Womack being the other.  Now Bill Lucy had no obligation to mentor me, but Bill Lucy choose to mentor me and told me that I was going to become active in the NAACP because it was a responsibility to all of the things that I had had an opportunity to enjoy as a black person that I needed to do something to give back.  When we had organizing campaigns, the NAACP was an area that I could reach out to because I was comfortable in the community and because of my blackness, too.  And learned a lot from the various branches and chapters that were around the country. I learned from Bill Lucy, through CBTU [Coalition of Black Trade Unionists], grassroots organizing for community-based actions and made those connects between those two organizations and I serve on both of those boards.  The same for the A. Philip Randolph Institute [Washington, D.C.], the same for United Way [Worldwide], there was always someone who pulled me along in order to be able to do that.  Inside of the NAA[CP], I've had wonderful mentors, Hazel [Nell] Dukes, for example, who will lay you to rest if you don't meet the standards that she thinks that you're capable of.  Got an opportunity to learn how to do organizing inside of our community that way.
Story_ID: 278304
Speaker 1: Got an opportunity to do the [NAACP] Image Awards.  I serve as its chair now, which was totally foreign to me, and to make it very reflective of the community and the kinds of things that we want to see exemplified in the images that are out there through entertainment.
Speaker 2: Now when did you become involved with the Image Awards?
Speaker 1: Five years ago. I was a vice chair for the Image Awards when I walked through the door, which was really pretty presumptuous.  [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond asked me if I would become a part of the committee.  I think that was at Bill Lucy's [HistoryMaker William Lucy] urging and the chair, who was [Charles] Chuck Whitehead at the time, asked me to serve as a vice chair with him because I had the mobility to be able to do some of the things without the restriction of a job that was in one location, I can develop and grow and, you know, reach out in a number of cities as I moved out along with my job.  My union was supportive that afforded me that opportunity while I did that work as well, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, now the Image Awards, I thought, I always, I've, it's hard for me to get--to talk about without asking about some of the images and you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --rewarded in the image--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --with the Image Awards.  I remember one year Michael Jackson won and it was right after he had surgery and, you know, I was wondering, what is the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] thinking about, but that was before you came--
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even then I was aware of him being a recipient.  I think that what makes the Image Awards unique, and the fact that it comes from the NAACP, so special is that him having surgery and all the rest of it had to do with his own personal side, what we were really recognizing was his genius through his work.  I don't think that there's any argument about how talented this man is.  And the contribution that he's made through song.  You ask me the question about songs and, you know, books and music and all the rest early on, Michael's lyrics are absolutely profound, even after his surgery he did 'Man in the Mirror.'
Speaker 2: Yeah that seems--well to me it seemed stranger that, that--
Speaker 1: It may seem strange to us but guess what those young people slowed down long enough to listen to those lyrics, and they didn't talk about what those lyrics meant as far as surgery was concerned, they were talking about their aesthetic differences and what that made them feel like or thought about.  And Michael says, it's acceptable whatever you choose to do.  Now some people have a problem with whatever people do that alters or changes they think you look more ethnic, less ethnic, long as your head is right I don't care if you strip your skin and have purple stripes with pink polka dots.  It's here in that heart and up there in that head that matters.  That outside dressing is secondary.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's the mistake that a lot of people make about our kids in particular.  Because they adopt the dress that looks like they're gangster, they're trying to survive in an environment.  Those same kids who drop their britches down to the--where the tops of the underwear show--(coughing) excuse me--or have their hair in braids that stick in every direction, those kids are computer whizzes that can slow a bunch of us down to teach us something about this new world of work.  A lot of those rappers are college graduates who are profound business leaders.  I mean, they manage companies, their own, their own ownership of these pieces.  They learned from the mistake of the entertainers of the past: they own their material, they own copyrights, they own stuff, and they're mentoring.  To me that's amazing, that is absolutely amazing.
Story_ID: 278305
Speaker 1: What's the most important thing that you do, that you--now?
Speaker 2: Well, at the time of this question, the labor movement is going through some really difficult times, having to take a more honest look at itself.  I think this is probably the most difficult period of my work life ever.  I'm enjoying the freedom of the comfort of knowing what I'm doing, but I'm troubled by not knowing the arena that I'm doing it in.  You mentioned earlier that labor unions were falling down in size, and we had the dialogue about, you know, work being shifted or changing--the movement is also changing. Folk who were players at one level are no longer satisfied with playing at that level but insisting on more.  Minorities are a large percentage of who the membership is in almost every single trade union organization, and women and minorities are pushing for their rightful place in the decision making bodies of each of those organizations.  In doing so, and I'm trying to be very careful with my words, it causes ruffles, but it is not that ruffle that's causing my uneasiness.  Where we go in the world of work depends on what work is available.  And I'm troubled when a country like ours is willing to give away total industries to countries that are not necessarily our friend, or countries that we're not looking to help build an economic base for, that will benefit the people of those countries because as the largest democracy in the world we do have a responsibility to do just that, to create an independent economy everywhere so that people everywhere will be able to enjoy a better life.  I am troubled when I see those entry level jobs that I was talking about earlier going to countries like China, where human rights and civil rights are certainly not there for everyday people, not for any people that I have seen who have had an opportunity to talk about life in China.
Story_ID: 278306
Speaker 1: I'm also troubled by work that is being marginalized in the African nations as well, under the guise of creating something to develop an African economy when what they're doing is reinstituting slave labor and not giving a living wage for that particular country specifically. So, what's left to bargain on this side of the world, I'm really concerned about our having an overall focus for building worker power through coordinated discussions, bargaining and attempts all across the world to make labor something that is respected no matter where you are.  A worker no matter who he or she may be or what country they live in should be able to do that work and be paid for it and be able to take care of her without family without going to sleep hungry at night, and that's happening everywhere here in this country that those kinds of situations don't exist.  So, it's a hard time right now trying to figure out what is there and how do you fit and I guess it's troubling, too, because at my age, at fifty-six, fifty-seven in a few weeks, I know that the energy that once was there for the fight is beginning to wane down and being able to encourage young people to do what we do if the rewards are not clear, or if disparities are showing themselves on a regular basis, it will be a harder task to bring younger and more vigorous people to the table.  I hope I'm making sense to you, but that's, that's the worry that's the concern.  What do we do about this thing that I love so much when we're not doing the right things to protect it?
Story_ID: 278307
Speaker 1: Are there plans in place to organize in countries like China and Vietnam and Chile or, I mean, places that, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We have had for a very long time international affairs departments and many of the trade union organizations where there's been a constant dialogue union-to-union or union-to-workers from the same industries around the world.  That base is breaking down because those areas where trade union movements were developed in other countries the work has been shifted from them to one where there are no trade union organizations.  There's the constant runaway from doing the right thing, it's not just running away here, they get an even poorer country, they'll go to Haiti, they'll go to wherever they can find workers who have to work for less money in order to get whatever little they can from earning a living, it's, it's just difficult.
Speaker 1: And here we even have the conundrum of Wal-Mart--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that offers cheaper prices--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the poorest people, you know, flock to a Wal-Mart to buy and Wal-Mart is a place that doesn't have many worker benefits at all, you know, there's no, no union--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --it's--
Speaker 2: You're absolutely right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But the perception is, they would rather spend a lot of dollars in their PR [public relations] campaigns, or in their advertisement, to give that perpetration (laughter) perpetrating a fraud of being fair, equal and just and all the rest of it, rather than sharing those dollars among the workers who make their monies for them.  They talk about providing benefits for their workers, but the fact of the matter is, is that most of the workers at Wal-Mart are getting benefits or healthcare through the support systems that are out there--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: --through Medicaid, Medicare, state-assisted programs that are there or extra monies that we pay into providing healthcare benefits for people who cannot afford to do it.  A lot of the workers at Wal-Mart--it's a second job.  They get a job where they do have benefits and go to work at Wal-Mart in order to make the extra money.  They play with the hours, it's a whole gambit, you know, it's, it's that kind of disgusting practice that gave us the term the Walmartization of American work because they're looked on as heroes or examples in the business community for making tons of money, but no discussion about on whose back--backs the money is made.
Speaker 1: And the other thing, I guess, that scares a lot of people in many small towns the Wal-Mart is now the town--
Speaker 2: It is, it is the town--
Speaker 1: --I mean the main street, the--it's all under one big roof--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --there's no, there's no downtown anymore--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --or not little, it's a, it's the Wal-Mart--
Speaker 2: It's the Wal-Mart.
Speaker 1: And, I know they've spun it on television as being positive that the elders working at Wal-Mart, they greet you and it's like a hometown--
Speaker 2: It's frightening isn't it?
Speaker 1: --atmosphere--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --but, yeah, where are we headed, I mean is--I know there's a labor movement, you know, early--
Story_ID: 278308
Speaker 1: Traditionally, whatever the industry was, it would be that union's responsibility to organize, you know, a villain per se.  Wal-Mart is so bad at breaking down the basic structure of decent wages and benefits for workers that all unions have put together to go after this villain.  It's not just United Food and Commercial Workers [International Union (UFCW)] who normally would organize a retailer like Wal-Mart that is running that campaign.  Every single union in the country has taken the charge for going after the protection of workers' rights by taking on Wal-Mart and exposing the truth.  As the truths get told, Wal-Mart is having to pay and correct some of those violations and people are slowly beginning to understand and see how the Wal-Mart takeover of a town, and that's basically what it has been, has been harmful, not helpful, to their own livelihoods.  Mom and pop stores are gone, regular hardware store where you could go and find every widget that you needed, gone, I mean you could go in any city in America and all you see is the same thing.  There were specialty stores across the country that you could go and find something and where you knew people by name.  Or your plumber could go and say, "Mr. Zuckerman [ph.], do you have X, Y and Z? The houses in the community need--," because they knew the community that they served they had things that were germane to that community.  Nineteen fifty style houses had plumbing needs that were different from the newer ones, and Mr. Zuckerman would carry it.  Wal-Mart, you have a blanket line of whatever, that's what you get.  And if there are no Zuckermans left, you're outta luck.
Story_ID: 278309
Speaker 1: In terms of your own career, I mean, where do you see your future now, where do you see it going, have you--seems like there's so many things that you can do, you know, from where you are right now?
Speaker 2: Well, in February of this year I took the responsibility of becoming the new president for the A. Philip Randolph Institute [Washington, D.C.].  Again, the first female to ever head the institute, probably scared to death because when you follow Asa Philip Randolph [A. Philip Randolph] and Bayard Rustin and Norman Hill, folks talk about the size of shoes, these are some pretty big suckers to try and (laughter) even stand in much less fill.  But the institute itself offers a different kind of challenge, there's a long-standing history of providing the education to the community for non-partisan political action, and that's what I'm charged with as its new president, to pull together that in a more succinct manner.  All of us tell stories of the battles of the last eight years surrounding our political activities, but I think within the communities that we reflect, those battles have been clearly pieces that require, or scream out for, more attention and care.  It's not just national elections that we focus on because the saying that all politics are local is one that's really real.  We have communities that are just outside of the mix of any concern--(coughing)--we may have a community where the garbage pick-up is every other week, most times it's in the community that looks like me.  Potholes will be the size of craters and no one sees this as an issue or liquor stores can be on every single corner, four in one block or commercial pieces in that community right in the middle of what is supposed to be residential.  Community agitation is where my heart is pumping along with workers' rights all at the same time.  So I'm learning from all of the pieces that I've been exposed to over the years how to frame a stronger and more aggressive A. Philip Randolph Institute to move forward.  How long do I plan to do that?  I don't know, I got bad wheels now, the old knees are certainly different at fifty-six almost fifty-seven than they were at twenty-two but what is exciting is that there is a young group of A. Philip Randolph activists that are rel- ready to take on the charge.  I'm gonna kinda listen to what they offer and see if I can fulfill my responsibility through framing it so that there's an action plan that we can all engage in that's gonna really speak to Asa Philip Randolph's direction from the very beginning of his work.  He was known as the most dangerous Negro in this country.  I like the way that sounds.  I like that.  And it wasn't because he carried a gun or a knife or any of that, but because he spoke truth to power, and he spoke to the reality of being responsible for all of us in this country, that no one was insignificant, I like the way that sounds.  And if that's dangerous where I'm going in the future I'm gonna be dangerous.
Speaker 1: In terms of black leadership today, and I know there are a lot of people that step-up and speak, but you wonder who they really represent, you know.  And in terms of A. Philip Randolph I think maybe, you know, everybody knew he actually had a following, I mean a rep- he represented people that voted for him and, you know, were solidly behind him and would do what was necessary, I think--
Story_ID: 278310
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Oh, how long do you want to hear this list (laughter)?  I hope that, in spite of all that continues to happen to us, that we continue to pull on the solid for who we are.  We've got a history unlike any one else in this country, and a legacy unlike anyone else in this country.  Ours has been one of constant struggle, and we're reminded by every single victory during the course of those struggles about our responsibility to who comes next.  My hope is that we don't forget who comes next.  That each of us who past thirty and forty and fifty remember the numbers from the decades behind us and pick up that banner and accept the challenge from nurturing, mentoring and stepping aside for those folks to become the leaders that they already may be.  The desire is to see a merging of all the color separation that goes on nationally, 'cause I do believe very strongly that, as long as we play the color game, that that real power that is there for us as Americans will never be realized.  And what's been wonderful about the organizations that I've had an opportunity to work in, is that even though they are thought of as black organizations, surprisingly most of them are founded by someone who is not black.  Most of them were built and strengthened by every single color in the rainbow.  Most of them were also led by every gender, male and female, sometimes somebody who was lesbian or gay, or transsexual, or whatever the LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender] terminology translates into--there was no biasness when leadership was real and honest and direct.  I'm hoping that the biasness disappears and that true leadership has an opportunity to step-up and take over and that age is not a criteria.  If it's twenty, let 'em run it. If it's fifty, don't say they're too old. And if they're eighty, be smart enough to listen to what they know is for sure, that's what I'm hoping for.
Story_ID: 278311
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you'd do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: Probably have a stronger relationship with both family and God.  I was blessed with a family that was very, very, forgiving.  My husband [Alfred Brown] who let me fly, my son [Alfred Brown, Jr.] who lifted me up, my mother [Annabell Jenkins Shands] who was my rock, my dad [William Shands] who was my, leader I would want to give more to them than I did.  I did a lot of receiving, I'd like to give more to them in this phase of my life.  And my relationship with God has always been very strong but I'd like to learn how to be more communicative without thinking that I had to be in a building.  I'd like that spirituality to be nurtured to a level where there's a comfort no matter what.  So I don't feel guilty about not making it to church, that's the kind of thing I'm talking about.  But that's what I would do differently, certainly be able to give more along the way than I took.  I took a lot, because my family gave a lot.
Speaker 1: What would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Oh my, hardest question that you've asked me all day.  Perhaps the willingness to be truthful, regardless of the consequences.
Story_ID: 278312
Speaker 1: You told us something about your family--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --already, but your, your mother's [Annabell Jenkins Shands] still alive right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And is your stepfather [William Shands] still alive?
Speaker 2: My stepfather is very much alive.
Speaker 1: Father [Prezzie Oliver]?
Speaker 2: My dad passed away (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --about two and a half--three years ago, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so is your mother pretty much satisfied that you, you did the right thing the--
Speaker 2: She tells me that, but if I was sweeping a ditch, she'd still be the same way.  No criteria for that love that comes just 'cause.
Story_ID: 278313
Speaker 1: Last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh my. First of all I hope when, when I'm long gone that someone will remember me and smile immediately.  I would like to be remembered as trying and in the effort bringing joy.  I hope that there has been an opportunity for someone to feel empowered from support that I might have given and that there might be someone who will speak to having been encouraged because of some of the risks that I took.  If that's achieved, then all that I was challenged to do, personally as well as externally, I think that it would have been fulfilled.
