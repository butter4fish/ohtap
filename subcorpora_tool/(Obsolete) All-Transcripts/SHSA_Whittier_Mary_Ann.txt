WHITTIER: I mean like I have a middle name that isn’t Ann, so what is the date?
CURTI: It is the 12th. Now I saw your husband’s little interview in here, but I didn’t see
yours. I was looking all through it and I couldn’t find it.
WHITTIER: Oh yeah, well there we are. I’m Van Berckelaer; that was my maiden
name under—they put all the females by their maiden name even if we’ve been married
fifty years. Oh, and I have the right to ask for a final copy of the interview.
CURTI: You do, oh there you are.
WHITTIER: I have a lot of memories; it’s funny just at Dohrmann Grove, when and I
saw these, oh I remember, in our junior year you showed slides of this and that. And she
says, gee, I don’t even remember that. And being on campus just stimulates even more
memories, things will pop into my head my head, I’ll think, “Oh my gosh.” Of course, as
you get older sometimes they pop in more slowly then others, but…
CURTI: But it’s always amazing what comes back to you and what triggers it, you
know.
WHITTIER: Right, I do have one of those, I don’t know, “Jeopardy” memories or
something, for all kinds of things. Okay, good thank you.


CURTI: And I’m going to take a look at your badge here because for our little posterity
here, we’re going to be recording you. And this in Denise Curti, and I’m interviewing
Mary Ann Van Berckelaer Whittier from the class of 1957 on October 12 as part of the
Alumni Stories. So were going to start off with the basics and wondering what your
major was?
WHITTIER: I majored in English literature with a minor in history, and to add to that,
after my first quarter of Western Civ, I was invited to be in the humanities honors
program. And that meant I didn’t go to -- I went to the lectures for Western Civ, but I met
with a small seminar group, and I had an oral final exam at the end of my freshman year.
So, it was kind of a precursor, I think, to some of the many things we do now, because we
followed up with an interdisciplinary senior seminar our senior year and I remember
enjoying that very much. It was on the creative process.
CURTI: Oh, yeah do you remember who taught it?
WHITTIER: No, I don’t. I do remember there were people from all different
disciplines and my pictures in the yearbook, the back of my head. That was one of my
goals as a freshman, to get the back of my head in the yearbook. And so there it was in
this little small seminar.
CURTI: There for posterity.
WHITTIER: Yeah.
CURTI: And where did you live?
WHITTIER: I lived in Branner for two years and then Union and then Stillman, of
course; Stillman being a Row house, it doesn’t have that name anymore. It was a former
sorority, and when I was at Stanford there were no sororities. And when my, or our three

daughters, came to Stanford there were just reinitiating sororities in the 80’s, but they had
already three girls; they had sisters. They weren’t interested in a sorority.
CURTI: Oh, I was going to say is that a good thing or a bad thing?
WHITTIER: I don’t know, sometimes you know at this later age my friends from other
schools will go to s—get together with sorority sisters and things, but Stanford had quite
a few fun things for alumni women to do together, so…
CURTI: Well that’s good to hear. What was your favorite or what do you remember the
most about where you lived or?
WHITTIER: Well a lot of things: our RA’s at Branner included Dianne Feinstein and
Liz Dempster [class of 1955] who married John Stahr [class of 1954], and where I live
now in Orange County Liz Stahr has been, you know, patron of all kinds of, well, the
Pacific Chorale, and she basically single-handedly got a wonderful public library for
Newport Beach. So she’s continued to be a Stanford alum that’s been really fine. I,
personally, was not interested in student government. I’d done that in high school and I
was so thrilled to have some academic classes that were challenging. I went to Glendale
High School and I got in along with, oh, about eight of us, and I had a full scholarship: it
was $660 for the whole year, $220 a quarter, and that meant a lot to my dad who couldn’t
have afforded it or would have spent his retirement money or something. And I
remember my spending money was $100 a quarter for the whole quarter, so I didn’t go
out for coffee very much, ate in the dorm. And well just to reminisce, Branner, we had a
dress code, we had to dress for dinner on Wednesday nights and I think Saturday or
Sunday. And we had hashers who served us: we didn’t go through cafeteria lines. And,
we would have a guest professor come, usually Wednesday night, have dinner at one of
the round tables in Branner dining room with some of the students and then speak to all
of us afterwards. But we had to wear stockings, high heels, dresses and it wasn’t all that
bad, you know, it was…

CURTI: Uh huh, and was it all females or was it…
WHITTIER: Oh, absolute—it was all females; and if a guy had to deliver a heavy box
upstairs or help you with something we would yell, “Man on second,” because you had to
take cover. Of course it had been a men’s dorm and so we had no bathtubs, we had only
showers, and most of the girls lived in Roble, on the female side of the campus. But we
were the girls who lived, you know, near Toyon and Encint—Enci—what is it? Encina
Hall. I was getting mixed up with Encinitas, California. But I thought it was kind of fun
to live on the boys’ side of the Quad and I did a lot of things with Ram’s Head eventually
and some of the shows at Mem Aud, so—that was close to Mem Aud out there.
CURTI: Oh, yeah I’m sure you guys were the lucky girls.
WHITTIER: Yeah, yeah, we thought it was—we thought it was all right. We had
summer quarter freshmen at that time, girls that didn’t make the cut and they were kind of
like on a waiting list to get into Stanford, because we still had some remnant of Jane
Stanford’s ratio of men to women. And so there were many fewer women and I
understand know it’s over 50% women, but we were definitely the minority.
CURTI: Well I think all over the United States and on colleges.
WHITTIER: But we understood Jane actually had a restriction.
CURTI: Oh, really? Well, I didn’t know about that.
WHITTIER: Oh yes, yes, oh yes, yes, yeah it was the Stanford ratio, and the men
complained about it sometimes, but on—interestingly enough, I got a low number drawn
with my—one of my two roommates from 2 East, it was an interesting corridor. And
Jane Cosgrove was our RA and I think she’s here too—this weekend. I look forward to
seeing her.

CURTI: Oh, is she?
WHITTIER: I heard that, but two of the three of us drew together and got a very low
number, so we stayed in Branner. And so our sophomore year, we had a new third
roommate because there were a lot of these sleeping porch kind of—three desks and two
closets, it was really a two person thing for three. And that was Carol, and Carol got
elected head of the dormitory and a couple of gals across the hall lost their roommate
because she just gave up on school at that point, so we moved right over the front door on
the third floor to a rather nice place that was sort of reserved for Branner sophomores.
CURTI: Oh, that’s always nice. It’s always good to get upgraded.
WHITTIER: Yeah it was a nice upgrade and I think I traveled off on this freshman
quarter, quite a few people dropped out, so that’s when this—the summer quarter
freshmen, frosh, had already done their thing—first quarter things over the summer and
they joined. And one of them has just been working at Stanford, Rene Spicer, she’s, she
was Rene Thompson [Rene Thompson Spicer, '57] then, and she was a very nice summer
entry after the winter. Whereas some of them kind of had a chip on their shoulder, I think
they felt like, “You think you’re better cause you got in regularly and we had to wait to
get in” and so some of them were a little irritated, irritating. I know—I’ve got so many
memories: one thing I remember in Branner days was the honor code which I still take
very seriously. I looked at my badge on the alumni thing and said “Well, we didn’t pay
for this or this: I suppose we could sneak in,” but I would never do that. And I didn’t see
many tickets and I thought, “Oh, the Stanford honor code, I hope is alive and well.”
CURTI: It is, very much so is.
WHITTIER: But there was an unhappy—a lady in Branner who at the art history class I
took from Mendelowitz, [MENDELOWITZ, DANIEL MARCUS, Professor of Art and
Education. A.B., Stanford, 1926, A.M., 1927. At Stanford since 1934] who was a
marvelous art history teacher, and it was a big lecture in Cubberley [auditorium], and we

had to turn in our final or midterm or whatever it was, and this other gal went up and
stood and looked through the tests that had been turned in and then made some erasures
and changed her own, so I reported her. But she, and she got called in and then -- I’m
not a liar, but I acted very innocent that I didn’t know anything about it -- and she really
made it tough on the girl she thought reported her, and I just remember thinking that that
honor code needs to be really honored or it’s going to fall apart…
CURTI: Right.
WHITTIER: …and so anyway I was a little bit of a tattletale, but I thought it was the
right thing to do.
CURTI: Umm hmm, well it still stands today, and it is because the students respect it so,
you know. You upheld and here it is, fifty years later.
WHITTIER: I think that in some of the Stanford magazines, I was happy to hear that.
CURTI: Yeah, yeah, that’s something to be proud of.
WHITTIER: Right. So dorms, I don’t know, do we call them dorms or teachers or
what?
CURTI: What about student traditions?
WHITTIER: Student traditions, well they still had the bonfire and…
CURTI: When were the bonfires?
WHITTIER: The bonfires were in football season, in the fall and they were out on dry
Lake Lag [Lagunita], I think. And I think after a while they had to discourage them
because of dangers or something, but…

CURTI: When you were going to school there?
WHITTIER: Oh, yeah, we had them, yeah.
CURTI: Oh, yeah, but you’re talking about later on.
WHITTIER: Later on yes; no, they had these big bonfires and we would—there was a
huge, I mean it was huge -- I mean it was a couple of stories of wood and very much…
CURTI: And everyone went?
WHITTIER: Most people, yeah, most people would go.
CURTI: Do you know how many students were here at the time or …?
WHITTIER: No, I don’t; isn’t that terrible? I was trying to think, and I really don’t
know. I thought maybe 1,200 to 1,800 in our class, but I’m not sure.
CURTI: Somewhere around there.
WHITTIER: Yeah.
CURTI: Oh, I’m sure nobody knows.
WHITTIER: Well, no, somebody knows.
CURTI: Well, somebody knows who’s putting this all together, but it just…
WHITTIER: That’s a memory I don’t have a good memory for. I do remember
Registration Day very, very well when I first arrived here.

CURTI: Oh, really…
WHITTIER: Well first of all, I come to campus from my public high school to have an
interview with Rixford Snyder, and the counselor there was a marvelous woman who
really helped because my parents didn’t even go to—didn’t even graduate from high
school, must less college.
CURTI: Oh, they must have been so proud.
WHITTIER: They were…
CURTI: They must have been so proud of you.
WHITTIER: …they—and they were not dumb, but they had to go out…
CURTI: Well, it was a different life back then.
WHITTIER: Yeah, yeah, they had to go out and help support their family or whatever.
I mean they’re not us, but they’re our parents. So, anyway, I’d been on campus and I was
comfortable with the campus pretty much, just walking across the Quad and so forth, so
when registration came we were told, of course, “If you’re smart enough to get into
Stanford, you’re smart enough to figure this all out.” And that’s always been the attitude,
and I think it still is. You know, “We’re not here to hold your hand,” but being a Van
Berckelaer, I was at the end of the rotating alphabetical family. So I went in and you had
to go from station to station and get your card stamped “Yes, you can be in this English
class” or this…
CURTI: Well, you were last in line…

WHITTIER: And I was last in line, so I got everything pretty well lined up nicely and
then I couldn’t get a biology lab. And I really wanted to take biology, so the only one
available meant I had to cancel everything else that I’d already built up on the schedule. I
used to say I felt like jumping off Hoover Tower about that time because the room was
thinning out, everybody was settled, and I had to get a Saturday class or a Tuesday night
class or something to make it all fit together. But, you know, it worked out and the next
semester it rotated a little bit more, but it was, you know…
CURTI: Your first big hurdle, huh?
WHITTIER: My first big hurdle was just registering for classes. Although as I recall
they had that four days when the freshmen still get welcomed and they have tug-of-wars
and they get acquainted and I think people did a fine job of that.
CURTI: Oh, that’s good, yeah they still do that and I see the signs out there with
everybody…
WHITTIER: Do they?
CURTI: Yeah, yeah.
WHITTIER: Well, Branner was fine, but there was no one—no other woman from my
high school there. They were all over in Roble, but, you know, we soon all made friends;
it was fun.
CURTI: Oh, that’s good. Let’s see. Were there any visitors to campus during your
years here that were particularly memorable, politicians or authors or…
WHITTIER: You know, I hear some of my classmates describe things that I didn’t take
advantage of; I was terrible. I think John Raitt sang in ”Threepenny Opera” is it, because

I was more involved with theater for some of the time, and Orchesis the dance group, but
I’m pretty sure he came as a guest artist and…
CURTI: What did you do with the theater group?
WHITTIER: Well, I was an English major, and I could take quite a few speech and
drama emphasis courses on that. So I took Theory of Acting and Theory of Directing,
and we did little skits in class, and we all had to take speech classes including the
engineers, my husband. And that was very good for us. We use to call it teach—“Speech
for the Teach.” The teachers had to learn to do that, and of course, most women at that
time were either nurses or teachers; that was pretty much what it was. There was one
woman in my husband’s engineering—mechanical engineering class.
CURTI: Oh, he’s a mechanical engineer?
WHITTIER: Right, and two of our daughters; all three came to Stanford, and two of
them have mechanical engineering degrees from Stanford, but they weren’t so lonesome
for, in fact – well, they kind of were in a way, in that, that when our one daughter got her
master’s degree here in mechanical engineering, she was one of the few blonde people
because there’s so many overseas people. It was ‘83 and she, in four years got master’s
and a bachelor’s in mechanical engineering. She’s a brilliant lovely person. And she
skipped kindergarten so, but so she was quite young, she was just barely 21 I think when
she had her master’s degree.
CURTI: Well that must make you proud.
WHITTIER: Yes, yes it does.
CURTI: Especially in engineering.

WHITTIER: Yes it’s a tough—and all of our daughters went overseas. Now that was
something that was just starting when I was here from ‘53 to ’57 --‘52 to ‘57 whatever,
anyway -- and I remember applying to go study overseas, but my Spanish wasn’t good
enough for Spain. So I applied to go to England and I didn’t get picked, but all our three
daughters each had, even the engineers, the experience of overseas study.
CURTI: Oh, that’s nice.
WHITTIER: …without going to summer school or anything to make up.
CURTI: Now, was it a big disappointment when you weren’t accepted?
WHITTIER: No, no, no you try, and it was a new program and it was limited and so…
CURTI: Yeah, well it’s good that they kept it because it’s grown, their overseas
programs.
WHITTIER: When you talk about important people, one of the legends here was Marge
Bailey [BAILEY, MARGERY, Professor of English. A.B.,Stanford, 1914, A.M., 1916;
Ph.D., Yale, 1922. At Stanford since 1914] who taught English, professor, one of the few
women full professors at that time almost anywhere and so I did take one of her classes
and she was absolutely a legend. She was a single woman, and no-nonsense kind of
approach to training you for life as she taught literature at the same time. “Now people in
18th century England did this, this and this and they found out that, that was a sensible,
reasonable, rational way to live, and we should make educated choices about our personal
things and not just go off because…”
CURTI: Well, she had been there and done that.
WHITTIER: Yes, and it really stuck with me; I mean, I was a fairly traditional, like I
say, person, and she probably reinforced my parental values and everything too. But it

wasn’t that we didn’t all challenge all those values too, but some of us didn’t go off nuts
and crazy. This class of ‘57 was a pretty tame group in general.
CURTI: But you had been through a lot with the War and all that.
WHITTIER: Yes, well, oh, my whole elementary school years were World War II and
threats of “Jump under the desk or the bomb shelter” stuff and the food and the airplanes
flying over and close all the drapes and so, I sometimes worry about today’s youth and all
the pressures in the world and then I think, well, you know…
CURTI: I had them too.
WHITTIER: Yeah, it’s been that way for most of us, I think at one point or another in
our lives, so. Oh I remember another thing Branner. Because it was so fun to meet girls
from other parts of the country and I hadn’t traveled very much. I’d been to Canada and
Mexico a little bit before I came here, but never overseas. And we had an earthquake and
the girls from the Midwest “What is that, what is that?” They didn’t know, and at that
time there were only fields outside of Branner, and of course I think “Go stand in the
doorway, it’s just an earthquake,” and then I remember seeing the fields undulating with
the tall grass, you know, it really emphasized it. And some of the girls from the Midwest
go, “Oh my gosh what is going on?” so we Califor—oh, and some of them had never
seen an artichoke at dinner and that was fun too, because they said, “Well what do we do
with this?” and so my roommate and I said “Well, you know, you take the leaves and
you”—and “Oh, you’re making that up” because we were great jokers, you know. “No,
that’s really how you eat them” and so, you know, it was nice experience of meeting other
women, and we always had these mixers with the different boys’ groups and stuff too. So
there were lots of opportunities to learn to play bridge or get acquainted.
CURTI: That’s nice, and what was the atmosphere like on campus? Was it
conservative?

WHITTIER: Well, yes when you think about today. I mean, first of all you did not
walk across Inner Quad in pants if you were a female. Have you heard that one before?
Oh, absolutely if you were on Inner Quad, you wore a skirt and of course we’d wear the
white bucks and sometimes a cashmere sweater, if you could afford one or you had one.
If you could afford a lot you might have them, but I know my roommate and I, we had
some kids come up from southern California for the UCLA game or the USC game. And
I remember the UCLA game somebody stayed with us, I think, maybe it was a year or
two later, but “We only wear white socks with our white bucks and that’s what we do at
UCLA.” And we looked at each other and said “Well I think these socks that match my
sweater are much nicer and to heck with your traditions.” But we had to go all the way
over by Roble, of course, for the girls’ gym and PE was required the first two years.
CURTI: And that was the main gym?
WHITTIER: And that was the main gym; that was where you went. So I took golf and
I took bowling one time off campus, and I was in Orchesis, the dance group, and took
dance and that was lots of fun. And looking through our yearbook I said I don’t think
we’re getting a mini reunion for Orchesis people, but I think some of us dancers lasted
better than some of the other ones, they didn’t know it was good for us, but we performed
in Mem Aud, you know, a little recital and that was fun. But you did not walk across
Inner Quad in pants.
CURTI: Ever, oh no, no.
WHITTIER: No, if you were going to the gym and you were prepared to whatever.
You walked around the other way and passed all those engineering funny labs and…
CURTI: A little discrimination? Or respect, I guess however you look at it.


WHITTIER: Yeah, it was just a tradition and we—I don’t know as anyone—I don’t
think you could ride bikes in Inner Quad either. It was very respectful and of course it
was full of dirt and, you know, they finally paved it.
CURTI: Oh, really it was dirt back then?
WHITTIER: Oh, gosh yes.
CURTI: Oh, yeah and so with the rain it?
WHITTIER: I don’t know; I only went there if I had a class and I just had a few classes
there, the old English Department. But, yeah…
CURTI: Oh, that’s interesting. What about—what faculty member—was it Ann Bailey
-- wasn’t she the one that had the most…
WHITTIER: Marge Bailey.
CURTI: Oh, Marge Bailey.
WHITTIER: Oh, no, but then I had, oh gosh, sometimes I forget some of these names.
He just recently retired. He was a younger professor of Shakespeare. Oh gosh, now I
can’t think of his name. He was very good. There was a Whitaker [WHITAKER, VIRGIL
KEEBLE, Professor of English. A.B., Stanford, 1929, A.M., 1930, Ph.D., 1933. At
Stanford since 1934] who was a real chubby old guy and actually, he took a leave and
went to the Huntington Library to do research and he was a likable lit type. There were
more females in literature classes than males, but there were some, and some of these
professors, you know, after being a rather successful high school student, even freshman
English, that first time I didn’t get a very good grade on something, I though oh dear.
And Mr. Bob was a TA, his last name was B-O-B-B [Sydney Ralph Bobb, PhD English
1954] and so we—so—a nickname for his first name and he gave me some terrible

grades, but as soon as I took the English placement test, I went right out and bought the
books for English because I knew I wouldn’t have to take dumbbell English and I didn’t.
But I was amazed how many people got into Stanford and still had to take dumbbell
English, like—I mean that’s what they call it at Cal and I guess, they called it that here.
But I was confident enough, I said “Well I can save them ‘till the next semester, but I’m
going to go to the bookstore now while the lines aren’t long and take care of all this.”
CURTI: Good thinking.
WHITTIER: And oh, right: pragmatic.
CURTI: Big lines back then too, uh?
WHITTIER: Right and I probably didn’t take enough advantage of some of the
opportunities to talk to professors. One time I saw professor Hildreth [HILGARD,
ERNEST R., Dean of the Graduate Division, and Professor of Psychology and Education.
B.S., Illinois, 1924; Ph.D., Yale, 1930. At Stanford since 1933] in the Psychology
Department, and I was feeling a little down about something and he was very kind and, of
course, he was top flight wonderful person. The Psychology Department was funny
because we were, we all had to take some introductory course, and then they used us as
guinea pigs for the older students. So we had to sign up for so many labs, and take these
tests or go look at a screen with something flashing, and then see if we had a subliminal
message or whatever.
CURTI: Pretty interesting to think back on what those experiments were.
WHITTIER: Well the one that—that amazed—that I still sometimes use to kind a brag
about a little bit or explain the futility was, we had one of those kind of IQ test things
where the E is facing three different ways and which one matches and that kind of thing.
So I took the test and these students wanted us to then have a good explanation of the test
and then retake it to see if we would improve our scores. Well I had a perfect score the

first time, so after the explanation I goofed on a couple, you know, so I threw off their
statistics. I thought, well that’s not going to help them very much and there was later I
think a joke probably after we were out that somebody fell down a hole outside of, what
do they call it, Memorial Library next to Cubberley there, but he got his leg stuck in the
hole and nobody was helping him, and he felt terrible, and someone came by and said
“Are you really needing help or are you a psych experiment?” Because…
CURTI: Everyone knew.
WHITTIER: Yeah, because the campus got kind of used to sometimes somebody doing
this psych experiment. But generally speaking, it was Professor Hildreth [Hilgard}
again, I felt no qualms about just going up and asking for an appointment and…
CURTI: So it was open to everybody?
WHITTIER: Yes, I think so. And, oh I used to hang out at the student health office a bit
too, because it seem like I was always getting a rash or something, and I was a bit of a
hypochondriac. And there were stories about how some of those doctors there and it was
true, you know, “Oh my toe hurts.” “Take off your blouse,” you know, and it never really
happened to me particularly, but there were some pretty good stories about the health
service that way.
CURTI: Back in the day.
WHITTIER: And speaking of health, I had my tonsils out on Stanford’s medical plan. I
did have a lot of colds and things and my parents—I was raised Catholic, but they—my
mother had sort of an anti-vaccination, anti … she was believed in wheat germ and raw
eggs…
CURTI: Natural.

WHITTIER: … and natural, and actually I’m pretty healthy to this day, I thank her for
it.
CURTI: Wow, yeah, geez, that was good for her time.
WHITTIER: Really very much , but I had bad tonsils and I got real sick winter quarter
one year and finally they said “Well just have them out,” and my parents just didn’t think
that was the thing to do or they didn’t have the money or whatever. So the story of that’s
pretty cute: I went in and had them out around finals week, I guess it was or dead week;
and in the meantime I had a blind date through a old high school friend with the man I
eventually married, and he came over with a beer can with flowers in it.
CURTI: Ahh, oh, that’s so nice.
WHITTIER: And then we went out once or twice, and I could hardly talk because I’d
had my tonsils out and I said well—he was in love with me before he knew how much I
could talk. Because he’s the quiet engineering type and I said well, that’s how I tricked
him. I had my tonsils out.
CURTI: Ahh, that was nice.
WHITTIER: But, oh, I remember so many things. I remember my roommate in the
hospital was Samoan and her family all came in and, you know, there was only one black
woman in our whole class and then in the younger classes that came after us there were
other—a few black students. But Jean McCarter is still very active in the alumni group
and she was in Orchesis, and we danced together and I even remember some bigoted
person I ran into says, “Oh blacks smell different” and all this stuff and I said, “Forget it,
I danced with one and they don’t.” So Stanford was just beginning and I suppose they
were reaching out like, to people like me with a scholarship who came from sort of
second generation immigrant parents, not too…

CURTI: And your Samoan roommate, they came straight from Samoa or?
WHITTIER: Yes, I’m not sure if she even was a student or what, but a whole bunch of
Samoans would come and visit her all the time and they were lovely people and it was
just a…
CURTI: Yeah, different culture for us here.
WHITTIER: Right, right, and now they’re very ubiquitous I think in—even in the local
high schools in southern California Samoans are putting on the football teams, so because
they’re good sports players. Oh, let’s see…
CURTI: Why do you enjoy coming back to Stanford for reunions?
WHITTIER: Well, I really love the classes without quizzes part and although this year
we’re not doing them, it’s just like we’re getting older and we’re saving all our energy for
our friends. But we’ve enjoyed that and I guess because our three children all went here.
And I do not regret that in spite of my Stanford education, I taught school a few years and
I stayed home as the full time mom and then I went back to some part time teaching and I
ended up actually being a dean of a community college department with a hundred
teachers under me for a brief time. But mostly I put energies into being a good mom and
to doing volunteer work. So why do I like coming back? Everyone’s really pretty nice
here and we’re now involved in that Founding Grant Society and they have a lovely little
luncheon once a year and one of our daughters lives in Los Altos. She and her husband
are both Stanford grads and so then we get to come see them and…
CURTI: Oh, yes, that’s nice.
WHITTIER: …so we hang out around here a little bit.

CURTI: Well good, that’s glad, I mean, we like the alumni to enjoy coming back, you
know.
WHITTIER: Right, well and when our children were students here we, of course, didn’t
donate much to the, you know, somebody would call you for—we always tried to help
out a little and go to the little alumni events. I think the regional alumni programs—the
Stanford women had Pasadena Junior Women and before we moved from there, that was
a big part of my social life to keep up with something intellectual.
CURTI: That’s nice to have those outlets.
WHITTIER: And then, come up here and go to a football game and just that kind thing
although we’re not athletes, we enjoy watching.
CURTI: What do you think about Stanford now days and how it’s changed in
comparison with the school that you knew?
WHITTIER: Well we were very big on supporting undergraduate education because as
our children were growing up and their friends’ parents would say, oh it’s so much
cheaper to send them to a community college and spend—save your money for grad
school or later. I never thought Stanford was not a bargain in undergraduate education. I
thought the quality was really excellent and actually I graduated a quarter early using my
scholarship money to get a quarter of grad work under the belt because I didn’t have a lot
of resources. And our daughters, some of them graduated early too with AP credit and I
told you the one that did four years of work or five years of work in four years.
CURTI: That’s incredible.
WHITTIER: But of course they didn’t qualify for needs scholarship because we’d
saved, but at that point we didn’t donate much to Stanford, we’re paying tuition for two,
that’s our donation. But I was terribly disappointed when my oldest daughter got put in

Branner and I first arrived. The lobby was trashed, it looked absolutely horrible. It was
co-ed, I’m all right with that. I raised three girls, they’ve got to learn to grow up in a
man’s world too and especially the engineers who’ve—they’re really fine traditionally
moral young women who can get along with men and not be a sexual object or
something, and it’s perfectly possible. I was a little irritated, right now our class is
having their class panel and last year the only—last—five years ago Glenn DuBose, who
I know from speech and drama and theater, he was the only one that had a very long term
marriage and his was a homosexual relationship and more power to him. But I was
disgusted that they asked people to be on the panel who are on their third or fourth wife,
who this one guy had dated somebody his daughter had as a roommate and then married
her and he was real flip about it. And I thought “No, we were the kind of straight arrow
group and we got married 10 days after graduation, we’ve celebrated our 50 th anniversary,
we have a lovely family.” Maybe it’s not exciting or worth mentioning to, but there was
a lot of us like that.
CURTI: Oh, yeah I was looking through this book, I was amazed there are so many, so
I’m surprised.
WHITTIER: And some married a class ahead or a class below or something, but—and
some of them of had much more adventuresome things, but I mean I remember at
Stillman House when I announced my engagement. What did we do? We passed
chocolates and something and then another gal had fortune cookies made for hers and
they’re still married, and she was an interesting one. I don’t know if you’d get her to
come in, but Leelane Ellis, she looked like Brigitte Bardot, and she was younger than the
rest of us, I was 17, but almost 18. I think she was like 16 and brilliant and so she ended
up her senior year at Stanford Law School and, well, she and I both dressed a little bit in
those sun dresses and stuff that were interesting, I guess, to people. Although I don’t
think we thought about it so much that way, but the guys in law school started taking bets
how long she’d last because she was this gorgeous blonde female in the law school, and
of course she went right through and got her degree and was just fine.

CURTI: Was she the only woman in law school?
WHITTIER: I’m not sure, but she was among the very few, right, and another
classmate, Margot Plant; she went to Boalt for law school after her four years. But most
of us were suppose to be teacher and nurses and that’s just the way it was. It was a lot
of…
CURTI: That was it in those days.
WHITTIER: Margo had saved some things from Stillman House and I’m doing the
mini reunion so I brought songs that we sang to the tunes of My Fair Lady and poems
we’d written about each other to be read. And they’d focus on catching a man, which my
parents weren’t particularly into that, but apparently the talk was some of the mothers—I
remember a girl saying, ”Well, just because I get my bachelor’s degree doesn’t mean I get
an MS at the same time” and that’s pretty much what people expected. And one these
little songs says if you can play, like a song flute or there’s another—a tunet—tonette and
you can work with glue then you can be an Ed major too. And the Ed department was
definitely the women mostly and at the bottom of the -- well just to take it’s probably still
true—just to take the graduate exam you could get 98% or 99% on it if you’re going Ed
school. But if you wanted to get a master’s in English literature my score dropped down
to 66 or something because obviously, all the dumber people became teachers. And I’m
afraid it’s only deteriorated since then with our public schools. Really, I have several
women friends who have PhD’s and -- not from here -- and they said “Well, one of the
biggest problems with public schools is that women have so many more opportunities
now.” And the brighter women used to, you know, just go into teaching and I was a heck
of a good teacher.
CURTI: Yeah, yeah it is the public schools’ loss, I mean…
WHITTIER: It really is, because there’s just more opportunities for women.

CURTI: Yeah, there are, but even so, teachers who go in there, they have great
educations and just, it’s hard to keep them there when they get paid what they do. So
yeah, it’s too bad.
WHITTIER: So, anyway I’ve kind of rambled on a lot, I’m trying to think of what’s
really important.
CURTI: No, I’m glad.
WHITTIER: It was a great experience. I went to the Catholic Church off campus
and…
CURTI: And where was that located?
WHITTIER: Oh, boy…
CURTI: Do you remember?
WHITTIER: No, I know we had to go to have pre marital counseling and about the
rhythm method and that was just in birth control which we didn’t agree with, but—and in
fact I left the Catholic Church. We were married in the Catholic Church and I left it later
and then we came back into Christianity through the Presbyterian door and that’s what we
are now. And I kind of think Stanford knocked some of the religion out of me. People
resent you saying that, but an unexamined faith isn’t much of a faith so it, there were
challenges to traditional belief. On the other hand, having some knowledge at least of the
Catholic Mass, which some people don’t think is the Bible, but it is, a lot of the Gospels
and letters -- was very valuable in literature classes.
CURTI: Um hmm, oh, that’s interesting, yeah.

WHITTIER: And when our daughters got here, they been Sunday school Presbyterian
raised and they had to buy a Bible for Western Civ and of course they had one. But they
couldn’t believe how many students on this campus had no idea of what was in the Bible,
which is kind of basic to civilization, and since then I’ve done a fair amount of Bible
teaching and I always feel like you can approach people by saying, The Iliad, The
Odyssey, the Bible, Shakespeare, you’re not an educated person unless you line up some
of these things. And then if the faith comes out of to speak to you fine, if it doesn’t, at
least you’re not ignorant of it, so…
CURTI: That’s interesting, yeah..
WHITTIER: Yeah, and I didn’t go to Mem Chu very often. It’s a beautiful building.
CURTI: It is; it really is. Any favorite memories?
WHITTIER: Favorite memories, oh freshman year—this is kind of like this year -- we
beat UCLA 21 to 20 and I was in the stands and of course we’d all traipse over.
Everyone was big football fan and we still didn’t have the greatest team, but we won that
game and people were so excited and thrilled and they tore down the goal posts and I
didn’t save a splinter, but that was just exciting, you know, the freshman year and how
we’d all just go over and cheer around the goal posts.
CURTI: How’d you get around campus back then?
WHITTIER: Walk: everybody walked, I walked.
CURTI: Were there bikes?
WHITTIER: There were some bikes, but it seemed like we mostly walked and a few
kids had cars, I never did, but my husband did. When he came, he had a car, but he lived
way out in the Village [Stanford Village] where you kind of needed a car. The walking


was wonderful for us. It kind of reminds you like living in New York City or in some
European city where you—that’s just what you do. And we still both love hiking and
walking.
CURTI: Were there a lot more trees around than you see nowadays on campus?
WHITTIER: No, I think they grew and get bigger and some still pretty tree lined
around here. I think they’ve done a wonderful job of adding on the buildings, although I
will admit when we first came to campus I thought, oh my gosh, there’s that other big
construction over there…
CURTI: The big hole.
WHITTIER: My oldest grandson who’s an Eagle Scout and a National Merit [scholar]
commended student and nominated for the Homecoming King of the dance and gets
800’s on all those whatever SAT subject matter things, will not apply to Stanford; I’m so
mad at him about that. So I’m trying to think of something bad about Stanford, but he
really wants to go to the East coast.
CURTI: Oh, really.
WHITTIER: And if he doesn’t get in Yale maybe we can persuade him as his back up
school to try here. But he’s such a bright, sociable, darling person and I think the
undergraduate education from what I’ve read, he could pursue all kinds of…
CURTI: It’s opening up a lot more.
WHITTIER: For history and all. But the other story on that was, after our first
daughter was the English creative writing major and our second one was the mechanical
engineer like her dad. The third one had SAT scores that, I mean, one that was higher
verbal and then higher math the middle one—the last one was middle, middle and she

chose engineering wisely because you can get a liberal education on your own, but you
can’t get an engineering education on your own as well. And the other sad thing about
me is, and this may be of interest historically, I took the SAT and I was never told my
score. I have no idea. The counselor, that was secret, but she was a wonderful helpful
counselor and she said to me “Mary Ann, what math have you taken in high school?”
And I said “Well in 10th grade I had plane geometry and then I wasn’t interested, so I
didn’t go on.” “You didn’t? You have math scores to get into Cal Tech.”
CURTI: Wow, and they wouldn’t let you know back then?
WHITTIER: No, not until I was al—and of course, at that point coming to Stanford, I
probably should have majored in—because I really wasn’t that good in English lit. I
mean I had to keep a B average to keep my scholarship and I mostly got B’s and C’s in
English. And I got my A’s in biology and, I don’t know, field studies or something;
picked them up here and there. So I don’t know if Stanford still grades on the curve like
that, but they were tough grader on the curve.
CURTI: Oh, were they? I don’t know. I don’t know. I’m in engineering now, so…
WHITTIER: Oh, you are.
CURTI: So I only know that school and I don’t think they grade…
WHITTIER: Well it’s a wonderful engineering school. If our grandson wanted to go
into engineering that would be probably…
CURTI: Thrilling.
WHITTIER: Yeah, yeah we push him a little harder there, but our girls got out of
engineering school here when it was all the emphasis on integrating females into that


force, and of course they were very capable of doing the work too. It wasn’t like
affirmative action where you get someone who can’t quite do it.
CURTI: Right, right you can’t do that with engineering.
WHITTIER: Well anyway they really—they’ve shone in their fields, but now they’re
mommies too and taken care of the kids and one thing and another, so anyway lots to be
thankful for, I guess.
CURTI: Yeah, it sounds like it. Well I think we’ve covered everything unless you can
think of anything else.
WHITTIER: Let me see anything else in the way of professors or—I know with my
husband’s engineering program, and after we were engaged at Christmas of our senior
year, we wanted to take a class together, so we took some sort of a—I think it was a
philosophy class and there was a wonderful professor in his favorite old thing was, if we
have three little black and white and red pixies on the thing and he’d talk about some
imaginary situation, I can’t remember the details of that now. But we went to class
together just so we could be together, and we both kind of got through the class some
way, but it was just something we could both fit into our schedules.
CURTI: What year did you meet him?
WHITTIER: I met him the end of my junior year. Married in the end of my senior year
and we were both 21. He’s six months younger than I am, he’d skipped kindergarten.
And so when we got engaged he was still 20, which is pretty young. But I see these
people saying “Oh, you’ve got to be 32 before you even think about getting married and
find yourself” and all that stuff and I think that’s silly; I mean, I have had various men
that I’ve worked with for various reasons or gone out to lunch with or gone out to dinner
with or whatever and I’ve been a loyal, chaste wife this whole time and there’s nothing
wrong with that. I mean, people—I think people really get themselves into trouble trying

to be more modern and sometimes they say, oh you can’t turn back the clock. Well I sort
of did with my daughters, I pretty much raised them that same way and they’re still with
the same husband and they’re happy and satisfied and …
CURTI: It’s hard to know what the secret is.
WHITTIER: Yeah, and I’m not sure when we’ve been up here on campus over the
years -- one year the Hispanic group was complaining there weren’t enough Hispanics at
Stanford and they’ve had quite an improvement, but it wasn’t enough, and sometimes
when I look at the reunion thing and I see all these different reunions based on gender and
there is a Stanford Daily writer who publishes editorials in the Orange Country Register
and so I’m proud to see a Stanford woman; she asks lot of things. But one of her
objections and when her children were here is, you put them in an ethnic dorm, well
what’s the point of bringing them up here to segregate them again? I think that’s a very
serious situation that should be addressed because I just don’t see the point of it,
truthfully.
CURTI: Yeah, that’s a good point. Not really one I had thought about in that way.
WHITTIER: Well, with this one tall blonde, 5’ 10” blonde engineer who wondered why
the cameras on the classes that were being broadcast to Silicon Valley were always
looking at her, because she was the most beautiful person there, and the most interesting
other than a lovely black woman that was in class, but the rest of these old guys, they’re
sitting around looking like engineers. But she lived in a Chinese dorm and did the
Chinese dragon and all this stuff, and I remember one of the first fellows that asked her
out offered her dope and she said no thanks and then he didn’t ask her out again, of
course, but I mean he looked at her picture. Her picture kept getting stolen off of the
little pictures ‘cause she was so gorgeous, but she’s a very, very straight arrow, lovely
person.
CURTI: Down to earth.

WHITTIER: Yeah, but I mean a lot of people have all these memories of drinking and
carousing and oh, probably, you know, we did a little bit of that, but it wasn’t—I really
remember the academics. I remember so well the Bender Reading Room of Rare Books,
and when I was doing a report on Elizabethan era I wanted to look at James—James the
First’s book that he wrote on witchcraft, and so they gave me the white gloves and I went
in and looked through and that was an opportunity, and I came back, because I later
published a book and I did some research at this library and got to go through the
Nuremberg Chronicles. I mean a lot of people have an edition of that, but there…
CURTI: Wow.
WHITTIER: And…
CURTI: Yeah, and you knew it was here because…
WHITTIER: I knew it was here and I also followed my old English professor to the
Huntington Library and got a reading card at the Huntington Library which is a
marvelous experience. So I thank Stanford for, you know, just taking my intellectual
curiosity and giving me, you know, the enthusiasm and ability to keep pursuing it because
whatever you learn, like what my husband learned in engineering, my gosh, I mean he’s
had—managed a group in Silicon Valley with sensors and micro, nano things, you know.
And I mean he didn’t learn that at Stanford, but he learned how to learn and so that…
CURTI: And they certainly learn that here now.
WHITTIER: Yes, yes, yes, but I mean that didn’t even exist when he got out of here
fifty years ago and yet he became—well, they call him Dr. Whittier and he never got a
doctorate, but I mean he had done that kind of work just doing his job well and learning
as you go, so that was fun.


CURTI: All thanks to Stanford.
WHITTIER: Yes, yes thanks very much to Stanford and what else nothing really.
Thanks to you for doing the interview and…
CURTI: Oh, thank you for doing this…
WHITTIER: It’s like, I’ve also really vivid memories sometimes and things that come
back to you and you’ll say oh my goodness what was that. We used to sit on the sun
porches and get tan and we didn’t think about skin cancer.
CURTI: Oh, of course.
WHITTIER: Yeah, we would lay out in Branner sun porch and Union sun porch and
we’d fry in the sunshine.
CURTI: Well what about smoking? Smoking was very…
WHITTIER: Oh, I smoked, yeah.
CURTI: Yeah, smoking was very predominant back then.
WHITTIER: Right, they had free cigarettes in the dorms. People passed them out just
like in the Army, you know, they’d have these little packs of four or five and students
were paid to be reps of Reynolds or whatever, the tobacco.
CURTI: Oh, really?
WHITTIER: Yeah, and they had it. Oh, and I don’t know as I use those particularly but
eventually my roommate gave me an ashtray one year and she wrote, my sophomore
year, and she said “Congratulations on arriving at sophistication”; a little Stanford


ashtray. And so I smoked and of course it made my father furious, but, you know, that
was my little rebellion. Just like my wonderful Eagle Scout grandson has long hair now
and that’s his rebellion. I think, it could be so much worse.
CURTI: Oh, well, you know, in the movies you see back then everybody is smoking, so
I mean it was just part of the culture.
WHITTIER: It was, yeah, yeah we did…
CURTI: Well, you gave them out in the dorms.
WHITTIER: Yeah, they did and of course we signed in and signed out. I mean, again
this Stillman thing signing out and signing in. I mean, if you worked at the desk you
could be out or if -- you know, I did work at the desk as a little part time job part of it -but everyone had to be in by 10:30 and the doors were locked. Unless you signed out and
then someone let you in and you sign out for a midnight or a 1:30 or I think even a 2:30 if
you went to the city for some big thing. And boy, they knew where we were and they
were, that’s just the way it was. It wasn’t that free and loose. And I think in some ways it
was good in that—I mean, you know, you are 17, 16.
CURTI: Right, yeah.
WHITTIER: And I remember to objecting to, actually it was the president of Pomona
College, because one of our Stanford buddies taught math there for years and so I was
outspoken at the time about a parent that sued because their daughter couldn’t get in their
own room because the roommate had a boyfriend in that room and they were having sex
all the time. She couldn’t sleep in own bedroom and I said I don’t think that’s right and
you’re paying tuition and…
CURTI: I think she’s giving me the bottoms up…

WHITTIER: Yeah, well, but I feel adamant about this.
CURTI: Yeah, no, no, no.
WHITTIER: But, and when my daughter moved into Branner, the first one,
Katchadourian [Herant Katchadourian, Dean of Undergraduate Studies 1977-82] was
the rep and he, I wrote him a letter and said, “I don’t think the money we have to pay
with tuition and dorm fees should go to buying alcohol to minors in California” and they
finally stopped it. But they were spending money -- and I know the two sides of it, you
don’t want them out drinking there and then driving, but…
CURTI: Right, that’s true.
WHITTIER: But it’s still not proper to buy alcohol for minors on campus and they— I
hope they’re not doing it anymore, but anyway.
CURTI: Well they don’t here, I can tell you that.
WHITTIER: Good, well that’s very good to hear.
CURTI: Well, thank you so much. This was really fun.
