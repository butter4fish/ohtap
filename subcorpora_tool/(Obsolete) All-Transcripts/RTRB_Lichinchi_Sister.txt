FARRELL: This is Shanna Farrell with Sister Leonard Marie Lichinchi and this is
an interview for the Rosie the Riveter/World War II Homefront Project. It&#039;s
September 20, 2015 and this is our first interview. Sister, can you tell me
where and when you were born and a little bit about your early life?

LICHINCHI: I was born in Queens, in Long Island City. I was born at home. My
mother had promised to have me baptized the day I was born, so my godmother
brought me to church, and the priest did not want to baptize me. It was a
weekday, and I wasn&#039;t ill. My godmother said to the priest, &quot;The mother wants
it, you know?&quot; So he finally gave in, because she said she wouldn&#039;t move until
he baptized me. She was very assertive. So I was baptized. She had to wait for
my godfather to come. My godmother was such a good friend of my mother&#039;s that
she was godmother for five of us. My godfather was my father&#039;s best man, and he
was the sponsor godfather for the same five or six people.

We were six children and my parents. They were both born in Italy. My father
came over when he was about sixteen or seventeen. He was educated, but he did
not know the language. He had a license to--they had the horse-drawn
carriages--to do that. He liked it. His friend, my godfather, Theodore, they
boarded together in Florida. When they asked my father his name, he said
&quot;Lichinchi,&quot; because that&#039;s how it&#039;s pronounced, and they interpreted that to be
&quot;Leo King.&quot; So he was always Leo King, until he realized that it wasn&#039;t so, and
then it was corrected. But he always enjoyed saying that, you know, &quot;You would
have had a shorter name, King, instead of Lichinchi.&quot; That&#039;s Americanized way.

Our church that we went to was Saint Mary&#039;s in Long Island City. My sisters who
married, three of them, they were married there, and my parents had been married
there as well. There&#039;s great attachment to the church, which still exists to
this day. Long Island City, when I was growing up, was mostly Italians, Irish, a
few other nationalities. I know we had some Polish people and some German. We
did also have Jewish people. Many of those were storeowners. We all went to PS1,
public school. My sister Albina, who was the first one there, she knew very
little English, because we spoke Italian at home. But she learned fast and then
she taught the rest of us, so we were all right when we went to school. My
youngest sister and my brother, who was the second youngest in the family, they
both went to Saint Mary&#039;s School, because we were living closer to it. My
parents rented the homes that we lived in. We all graduated from high school. My
parents--especially my mother--was very demanding that that&#039;s what would happen
to us.

I was born in 1924, February 14. I had two older sisters, about maybe three
years older, together. I can&#039;t think of anything else on that line. My father,
as I told you, drove the carriages, and later on, he was working for the
railroad. I think it was mostly manual labor, and he worked with other people
there. I didn&#039;t hear much complaining about things, even though we certainly
weren&#039;t--I would say we were poor, but not like the poverty you see today. We
always had food, we always had clothing, we always had all the things that we
needed, but I would say it was more everybody was the same there, so you didn&#039;t
see that. Of course, not having TV and radio, that brings the outside world,
too. You&#039;re contented with what you have.

I had a very good friend, Theresa Grosso, and our families were also friendly.
We went all through grade school together. We were inseparable. We went through
grade school together, and then we both wanted to be dress designers. That&#039;s
what we said in those days. Today it would be fashion. We didn&#039;t know where we
could go to school to get what we wanted. We found out that we could go to
Washington Irving High School. The school was outside our district, but if you
wanted something that the local schools couldn&#039;t give you, you got permission to
go ahead. So we both went there. In Long Island City, Manhattan was just one
subway stop away. We went to high school. We get there, and we find out that
we&#039;re not put in the dress designing group, but we were put in the art group,
painting and all the other things. This was after we had started our term.
Afterwards, when we found out that it wasn&#039;t what we wanted, they couldn&#039;t
change everything. They did change the hours that we would have had art to
having sewing, which you also need. Now, neither of us knew how to sew, but
their argument was--which was a very valid one, that we should have figured it
out ourselves--how could you design dresses and other clothing without knowing
the sewing of it? You know, what parts you need. So we started that.

My very first thing that I sewed was a baby&#039;s dress, like we would have used for
a christening dress, all handmade, with all little tucks and everything. It came
out so beautiful. I didn&#039;t know I had the talent to sew. We learned how to
design also, and how to make patterns, paper patterns. We also were taught how
to drape the fabric on a dummy and make that. I made a coat. I designed a coat,
and sewed it, made it up. It was a winter coat. It was a dark burgundy color,
princess style, and I was happy to wear it. It was lovely. I remember, for
graduation, for the graduation ceremony, you had to wear something that you
designed and made. I remember making a two-piece waffle-print dress--suit. No,
it was a two-piece suit. In our senior year, we had to learn how to drape over a
dummy. We draped fabric over it, and we had to make something. I made the gown
for a prom, which I didn&#039;t go to. They did hold the prom in Roosevelt Hotel.
[pause in recording]

FARRELL: Okay, we&#039;re back.

LICHINCHI: Theresa&#039;s family moved to Brentwood in our senior year, and naturally
I stayed on. When I graduated, the school suggested someplace--there was
opportunity for me to work in certain places. I was being sent to a designer. If
I remember correctly, the name was Serena Alexander. It was on 57th Street, off
5th Avenue. I had been there the semester before. For those of us in that
particular course, if your grades are passing, at least, the last semester you
went one week to work and one week in school. I had been sent to Serena
Alexander. That&#039;s the full name. I thought I really was going to learn things,
but I didn&#039;t. I ended up being more like a gofer. They were nice to me and all
that, but that wouldn&#039;t be a place I would choose to go if I was going to work.
That was the place I was being assigned to. I went back to school and I told the
person who was assigning jobs that I wanted to learn more. I wanted to have more
experience with the power sewing machine. She said, &quot;Well, you&#039;d have to go to a
factory.&quot; I didn&#039;t know what a factory was, so that was fine by me.

So I went to a place on Adams Street. When I got there, I realized that it was
making soldiers&#039; uniforms. It was quite a group of people there. Many of them
were deaf and mute. They very seldom stopped the machines, because then you
couldn&#039;t hear them. But then when they did, they got us very interested, but we
couldn&#039;t tell what they were saying. We also had some people that were blind,
and they worked beautifully on the machines. Naturally, they didn&#039;t look at it,
but there was never a problem. Nothing happened. And here I was, learning how to
do it. What I sewed was the back pocket. I sewed the welt seam. The manager
taught me what I was to do, and I started sewing. I was treating that one part
of the pants as if it was a dress on 5th Avenue. He watched me, and here I&#039;m
struggling with it. He came over and he said to me, &quot;You know, Yolanda, this is
piece work.&quot; I thought he was referring to that these were all separate pieces
of the same part, but then I understood that I would be paid according to how
many I sewed. So I learned how to sew quickly.

FARRELL: You had mentioned that you were assigned to work different places. Was
that your school assigning you to work?

LICHINCHI: Yeah. Not really assigned. They suggested, I guess you would say.

FARRELL: So it was like a career--

LICHINCHI: Yes, like a guidance counselor, although they didn&#039;t have guidance
counselors in those days. Yes.

FARRELL: Were there other options that you were given, or you were just
naturally interested in making clothes?

LICHINCHI: No, I was interested in the sewing part of it, yes. Because I wanted
to design clothing that would suit me, and in all different colors. Then, as an
adult, I ended up wearing the same outfit everybody else wore, and it was always
black. [laughter]

FARRELL: Around what time was this? What year?

LICHINCHI: I graduated elementary school in &#039;38, so this would have been when I
graduated from high school, &#039;42.

FARRELL: You went right from high school to this job?

LICHINCHI: That&#039;s right.

FARRELL: How long were you doing this for?

LICHINCHI: I would say I really don&#039;t have the memory of why I left that job.
Then I went to another one, where I sewed gloves and parachutes. I don&#039;t
remember what happened that I left there. I have no recollection of that. Either
it was horrendous or not worth thinking about. That&#039;s all I can think of. I
don&#039;t have any memory of something being unpleasant. Maybe the work was finished
and we all left. I couldn&#039;t say. I&#039;ve been trying to remember that, but I can&#039;t.

FARRELL: When you moved from sewing the soldiers&#039; uniforms--it was on Adams Street?

LICHINCHI: Adams Street in Brooklyn.

FARRELL: So you started working on gloves and parachutes. Was that also for the
war effort?

LICHINCHI: Not the gloves. These are dress-up gloves. They had the seam--it was
outside, and the sewing--not the seam. The seam, and then some of the fabric was
still outside it. You know? It was very intricate. I was glad to have had that
experience. Now, maybe I just moved from place to place. I don&#039;t know. Because
it was wartime also. Everything was war-related. From what I figure, from the
time I went to Republic to work, it probably was about a year, at the most,
before I went to Republic.

FARRELL: Growing up, you had mentioned that your father, Leo, had worked on the
railroad. Was he working on the railroad during the Depression?

LICHINCHI: I guess so, yeah. I guess so.

FARRELL: Do you have any memories of how your family adapted or reacted to the Depression?

LICHINCHI: I don&#039;t know. When I say &quot;I don&#039;t know,&quot; I didn&#039;t see anything
different between ourselves and the other families around. I have no memory of that.

FARRELL: One thing I did forget to ask you is, what&#039;s your mother&#039;s name, and
where in Italy did both of your parents immigrate from?

LICHINCHI: My parents were both in the province of Potenza. On the map, they
were on the Adriatic side. If you knew where Naples was on the ocean side, they
were across in that area. That&#039;s how they described to me where they were. I
guess it&#039;s the town that they grew up in was Venosa, V-E-N-O-S-A. As I said, my
father came over. I think he was sixteen or something. His parents had--I think
it was vineyards. I&#039;m not sure. They were well-off. He had an older brother. I
guess people just traveled. I don&#039;t know. I know he went to volunteer for the
war, the first world war, but they were too late. Maybe they were very lucky,
but they were too late to be taken, both he and my godfather. That&#039;s about what
I remember.

FARRELL: What was your mother&#039;s name?

LICHINCHI: My mother was Rosa DeVietro. My mother, as a teenager, with other
young ladies, worked with the--I can&#039;t think of the word that comes to
me--cloistered, for the cloistered nuns there. My mother and some other girl,
they worked there, and they lived there. The nuns made pastries, all kinds of
pastries, all kinds of pasta, and sewed a great deal, in different ways. They
interacted with the laypeople that came to buy it. My mother carried that skill
in baking and cooking when she was our mother. Cooking, to her, was an art. The
simplest meal was presented that way, and such gratitude for it. I remember
that. In Long Island City, there&#039;s an area that has factories. I know there was
a place that made coats, and the people were hired to sew buttons or something.
Once in a while, I know she went out there and came back, but she wasn&#039;t a
steady--she was really a home person. I hope what I&#039;m telling you is what my
sisters would also say, because my memory isn&#039;t that great on this. But I don&#039;t
think it would be too different. Then I think I&#039;ll move on to high school.

FARRELL: Sure. You went to P.S.1. D-Day was in 1941. Do you have any memories of
that day or when the war started?

LICHINCHI: Oh, yes. We were listening to the radio, and we heard, in 1941, that
Pearl Harbor was bombed. Our brother, he was about maybe six years younger than
I, maybe, around that time. I remember Roosevelt, hearing him on the radio, but
I don&#039;t remember exactly what he said. He did say what a terrible thing had
happened there. I guess we talked about it, but I don&#039;t--and we didn&#039;t have
anyone very close to us that was old enough to be into the service, although our
neighbors and other persons of the family, they did.

FARRELL: Did you have a sense that the war was coming? I know you were younger
and you were a teenager, but did you have a sense that something big was happening?

LICHINCHI: As I&#039;m thinking of this, I&#039;m not sure if I knew it then or it&#039;s what
I taught later as a teacher in social studies. I&#039;m not sure that I would know. I
probably was about fifteen or sixteen then. I don&#039;t remember. I know we had
rationing for sugar, and I think for shoes. I think you were only allowed to
have so many coupons. I know we had that. I know people collected things, like
metals that were around, and other things like that. I don&#039;t know how much we
were personally involved in it. That&#039;s what I remember. Not too much.

FARRELL: When you had graduated, were you interested in helping with the war
effort? Was that what--?

LICHINCHI: No. Well, it wasn&#039;t a case of helping or not. It just didn&#039;t come up.
When we talked about it, it was with great sadness, but at the same time, with
great patriotism. It was so easy being patriotic then. Later on, when I was
teaching in high school, with the Vietnam War, it was such a different thing.

FARRELL: I&#039;m interested in that. Can you tell me a little bit more about what
you mean by it was easy to be patriotic?

LICHINCHI: This is the part I&#039;m not sure I knew then or because of what I
taught. Roosevelt wanted us to go in to help the Allies, England and all that.
He was trying to influence the country in such a way when he spoke that they
would see that it&#039;s good for us to be in it. I think we just took it, that it
was good for us to help. I remember in high school, I had the social studies
teacher, and we knew nothing about what was happening. It wasn&#039;t taught, what
was happening to the Jewish people. He said, if we don&#039;t go into the war, he
would kill himself. We didn&#039;t know why he said that. If we lost the war, that&#039;s
what it was. Because he felt they were coming over, the Germans and the others,
that his life was in danger. Not for himself, but his family. But fortunately,
that did not happen. Little things like that that come back, but I&#039;m not sure if
it happened then or when I taught the class.

FARRELL: So you moved from making uniforms and gloves and parachutes into
working on an assembly line in a hangar and installing fuel lines for P-47s?

LICHINCHI: P-47s, the Thunderbolt, right.

FARRELL: Can you tell me a little bit more about how you moved into that job?

LICHINCHI: How I got there, right? My friend, Theresa, her father was a tug
captain, which means that the tugboats that moved other boats, he was the
captain of that. It was better for him to be living out on the island, so he and
his family moved out to Brentwood. Brentwood, at that time--that was &#039;42,
&#039;43--was not what it is today. From Suffolk Avenue all the way down to--what&#039;s
that parkway up there? I can&#039;t think of it. Anyway, there were only about four
or five people, houses, in that space, for that long distance, which is more
than a mile. We traveled by Long Island Railroad, so we took the Long Island,
and then we had to walk home, because we had no other way of getting there. We
lived a little bit more than a mile away, but it was a good walk. My friend
moved to Brentwood, and I had been out to see her. I would go back home by the
Long Island to Queens. I must have been out of work. That&#039;s all I can think of
to try to fit into what happened. Theresa lost her last semester at Washington
Irving, but she made it up later and got her graduation, high school.

I came to visit Theresa, and I was going to be with her for a couple of weeks,
so I must not have had a job. Or I had a vacation. She asked me if I would
accompany her to this workshop in Bay Shore that was training people to work in
Republic. I was very unsophisticated, and I said to Theresa, &quot;I&#039;ll go.&quot; She
wanted me to go with her. She would be there practically the whole day, so I
might as well be there. We went by bike to where we had to go. I was in the
class with her. I was never questioned what I was doing there. We learned
everything about the tools that we had to use. Then it was time to be assigned
to Republic, the job. The woman interviews us. I was baptized Theresa Yolanda,
although my mother wanted me to be Yolanda, but he told my godmother that that
was not a saint&#039;s name, so I couldn&#039;t get Yolanda. So my godmother said to him,
&quot;The princess of Italy is Yolanda.&quot; He informed her that she&#039;s Mary Yolanda or
whatever, but she has the name Marie with it. They were trying to figure out
what name to give me, because my mother didn&#039;t give it. I think it was a
time--because 1924, there was a lot of interest in the Little Flower, Saint
Therese. So that&#039;s how I got the name. He said, &quot;Let&#039;s take Theresa. She said
yes. So, Theresa Yolanda. I went all through life being Yolanda until I became Leonard.

So I&#039;m on line, and this woman is asking each one of us as we&#039;re coming in to
get our assignment for Republic--which I personally didn&#039;t want. So I had
Theresa. She says to me, &quot;And what&#039;s your middle initial?&quot; I said, &quot;Y.&quot; I said
it to her three times, and I couldn&#039;t think what was wrong. She thought I was
asking why did she have to know it, not that my initial was &quot;Y&quot; for Yolanda. We
got over that, and we were assigned and went to Republic. I guess they must have
taken us in a car or something. There are about maybe eight or ten of us, and
we&#039;re all standing in this hangar. That&#039;s the first time we saw it. It was huge.
They had two rows of planes, parts of the planes. The cycle was two hours. Every
two hours, you would move. If you&#039;re on the assembly line, you were on a very
high platform. I think it was about nine feet tall. Because people worked
underneath while you were working on the top.

Theresa nudges me and she said, &quot;Oh,&quot; she said, &quot;I hope I get on the assembly
line.&quot; I wasn&#039;t happy where I got, just wanted to get out to get home. The other
choice was working--they call them benches, but they were tables where the
people made the parts, or they assembled parts that those on the assembly line
would install. Theresa said, &quot;Oh, I want to be on the assembly line.&quot; As I said,
I didn&#039;t care where I was. They called out, and Theresa was called to work on
the benches, or the table. I&#039;m there, practically the last one, and I get
called, and I&#039;m on the assembly line. Fortunately, after my experience with it,
I was very lucky, because I was working with this fellow, John Esposito, who was
just wonderful. He was so thin, and, which I found out later, we both had to
work together at one time in the cockpit. It was a one-seater plane, and we had
to work together without, naturally, the seat being there, and it was tight
quarters. I probably was taken because I was very thin and short. Theresa wasn&#039;t
too different, either.

When we got assigned to the different places, I spoke to the manager, and I said
to him, &quot;I really don&#039;t want to work here. I want to be released to go home.&quot; He
said, &quot;If you don&#039;t do this job&quot;--after they trained me for a week or so, I
should have known that there was a catch to it, but I just didn&#039;t. I didn&#039;t pick
it up. So I worked there, and we installed the fuel line. Every day when the
manager came by to check up, I always said to him, &quot;Will you try to see if
everything is tight enough and everything?&quot; and it always was. I was so
concerned, because, as I said to John one day, I said, &quot;They&#039;ll never have a
second chance being up in the plane if we don&#039;t do our job right.&quot; I worked with
John, and he was a wonderful person to work with. He probably treated me as his
daughter, but that was okay. On the assembly line, I don&#039;t think there were more
than five women. Most of them were men that worked there. At the lower level,
underneath the plane, I knew there were only men there. When we had a coffee
break, the gong went off and everybody had a coffee break at the same time. You
did find groups that you could just talk with.

It was pleasant. I can&#039;t say it wasn&#039;t pleasant. But I was missing my family. We
worked six days, mostly six days, and it was very difficult to go back to Long
Island City--yes, Long Island City, because I was thinking of Jackson Heights,
but they hadn&#039;t moved there--in Long Island City, to see my parents. I was
afraid to tell my mother what I was doing, because she wouldn&#039;t be happy of my
working that way. Many weekends, we just did our wash. We wore slacks. You had
to wear slacks. You had to have your hair in a bandana, and they had many
pictures around of women who lost their hair because it got caught in the wheel
of the drill or anything else. It was horrible, because the root and all was
pulled out. So you only had to see a picture like that to make sure your bandana
was on right to close it.

FARRELL: Did they instruct you on how to tie the bandana so that wouldn&#039;t happen?

LICHINCHI: Oh, yes. Well, no, I&#039;m not sure they did. They just told us to keep
it covered completely.

FARRELL: Were you ever working when an accident happened?

LICHINCHI: No, I never saw anything. I know I worked in the summer, and I know I
worked there at least for one Christmas, because of what happened that I
remember. Let me see now. You think I had the movie right in front of me. I see
it, but I can&#039;t see it here or there. No, that&#039;s it. Republic is really in
Farmingdale, but the train station, they had a section put in, so the train
stopped right at Republic, and then it was quite a long walk to get--a covered
walk, though, it wasn&#039;t outdoors--to where you worked. They were a nice group of
people. I remember some of them. They were just very kind and nice. I never had
any experience with somebody not treating you nice or making remarks. I did have
one experience, just to show how unsophisticated I was. This particular man
climbed up there and talked to us. He said did I want to go with him? I said,
&quot;Where?&quot; He said, &quot;We could go swimming.&quot; I said, &quot;I&#039;m not interested.&quot; When he
left, John said to me, &quot;Give him a wide berth.&quot; I learned from him. He would
give me the signals for some of them that he felt were being pesty. I never had
any experience like that.

I know we belonged to a union, and the manager, the person in charge there, they
were going to vote. I didn&#039;t even go to the meeting. But anyway, they were going
to vote. He calls me aside, and he said, &quot;When we vote, you vote for this
person.&quot; I just looked at him. But I didn&#039;t go. I wouldn&#039;t have worked for what
he said, unless I also thought it was good. Those are the little things that
sort of help you to live. I think, in growing up, we had a very sheltered life,
because everybody in that area knew everybody, and there was kindness. We had
our usual crushes and all that. Somebody was important to us from school, but
that&#039;s what it was.

FARRELL: With the union, did you have to join the union?

LICHINCHI: I don&#039;t know. He just said I was a union member. I had no clue.

FARRELL: And you don&#039;t remember paying dues?

LICHINCHI: No, no, and I never went to a meeting. But I did hear people talking
about the union, and they were saying how it&#039;s important to go, and they were
saying it&#039;s so lengthy. Later, when I was teaching about the unions in school, I
remembered some of the things that they said and why they said it. They said,
for those who have a plan that they want to happen there, they get their way
because people just give up and go home, because they made unimportant things
last too long. Then, when they have the people there that they want, that are
going to go their way, then they vote that way. But whether that happened
frequently or not, I don&#039;t know.

FARRELL: So you didn&#039;t have any real formal training for the job?

LICHINCHI: Yes, I went with her to school.

FARRELL: Can you tell me a little bit more about--

LICHINCHI: We went to the school, as I said, Bay Shore High School, and we had
class every day. They took all the different tools, which I can&#039;t remember now,
and how to use them. I think, probably, we were taught about safety. They had
different kinds of machines and that. I have a poor memory about this. This will
probably all come clear in my mind when I no longer have to do it.

FARRELL: Do you remember the length of time of school? Was it about three months?

LICHINCHI: No, two weeks. I&#039;m not sure it was two weeks, but I know it was more
than one week. I don&#039;t know if it was more than that. It was a full week. That I
know. We had very few cars around. First, gasoline was rationed. That was
another thing during the war. And we didn&#039;t know how to drive. One day, this man
with his car--I don&#039;t think he hit me, but I fell off the bike. He gets out of
his car and he says to me, &quot;Get on that bike.&quot; I didn&#039;t want to get on. He said,
&quot;Get on that bike.&quot; He really forced me to get on it. I guess I wouldn&#039;t have
gone on again, because you think you&#039;re going to get hurt. That was good,
because I felt that--and when I got back on, there was no problem. He probably
was in a hurry to get someplace, but he would take the time to teach someone
it&#039;s better to get on it and have the confidence of being on it than--

FARRELL: What was your uniform like, or your work outfit?

LICHINCHI: Slacks.

FARRELL: So the slacks and the bandana. You had to wear coats or heavy gloves?

LICHINCHI: No. No, I didn&#039;t do any work that would require that. We were
indoors. Naturally, we had the signal for lunchtime. We used to sit outside the
hangar, and then we used to hear these planes. One day, I asked somebody. He
said that they&#039;re testing the planes. It was an awful place to be, where people
are testing. I don&#039;t remember any accident happening or anything. I know they
received awards for the work that was being done there, and I think they
mentioned something in that paper that I gave you. [pause in recording]

FARRELL: We&#039;re back.

LICHINCHI: As I said earlier, we worked six days a week, but some sections
worked seven days. It wouldn&#039;t be on the assembly line, because you would need
everybody there in every section. But where Theresa worked, they wanted her to
work on Sunday. We&#039;re on the Long Island Rail Road, going home, and she said to
me, &quot;They&#039;re after me again.&quot; I said, &quot;Theresa, you have to make your mind up
what you want to do,&quot; but I understood her position. You have to go to work so
early, and Saint Anne&#039;s Church, which is our parish, they only had one mass on
Sunday, the mass that we went to, anyway. She said, &quot;I wouldn&#039;t be able to get
to mass,&quot; and all that. As we&#039;re discussing it and coming to no solution, we
look up and we see these two nuns on the train. They may have been there other
times, but we didn&#039;t notice them, but that day we did. Prior to this episode, I
had said to Theresa, &quot;I&#039;ve always wanted to be a sister growing up.&quot; We had
sisters in religious instruction, and then when you made your confirmation, in
those days, I made my confirmation the same day with my sister and my younger
sister and my brother, because in those days, it wasn&#039;t part of the liturgy. The
bishop went to each place. So many grades were connected. When you had
confirmation, that was the end of instruction at that time. I forgot why I came
to that.

FARRELL: You were commuting. The long commute.

LICHINCHI: Commuting, and the sister. I said to Theresa, &quot;Let&#039;s go over there
and ask those two sisters. Maybe they can resolve the issue.&quot; So we go up to
them, and they look at us very strangely, because we had these bandanas still on
our heads. We said, &quot;We want to ask you a question.&quot; We turned around and
chatted with them, and then we told them what happened, what we were talking
about, and what would their answer be. They said, &quot;There&#039;s no problem with
that.&quot; They said, &quot;You ought to go to speak to your pastor.&quot; He was Father
Graham in Saint Anne&#039;s. They didn&#039;t know where we lived, and we didn&#039;t know
where they lived. When we get to Brentwood Station, the four of us are leaving
the train. They thought we were following them, and we thought they were
following us. They said, &quot;No, no, no, not here. Your own parish.&quot; I said, &quot;We
live here.&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; they said. They said that they lived there, and we never knew
that the convent was there. We never saw it. That&#039;s how we knew. After that, we
would meet them every Saturday, and we just chatted with them, and they would
invite us for activities in the academy when they had the bazaar and other
things. We had a wonderful relationship with them. They were very friendly. When
I had spoken to Theresa one day, I said, &quot;I better get going on this process.&quot;

I went to Father Carpentier, who also lived in Saint Anne&#039;s--not in Saint
Anne&#039;s, but for that parish. He was standing with the convent property behind
him, and in front of us was Saint Anne&#039;s Church. I told him what I wanted. He
said, &quot;What about these people?&quot; I said, &quot;What people?&quot; I didn&#039;t even know a
community was there, the Saint Joseph community. I said, &quot;What do they do?&quot; He
said, &quot;Teach.&quot; I said, &quot;I don&#039;t want a teaching order.&quot; I said, &quot;I would like to
take care of children.&quot; He gave me a book to read, Convent Life by Scott. When I
would read it, I would always bunk it under my mattress so Theresa&#039;s mother
wouldn&#039;t find it. To go back to what we were talking about earlier, that day we
went to see Father Graham, to ask him the question. He came and he said to us,
&quot;If work is necessary, you have to go there.&quot; We kind of thought that, too, but
in those days, you were a little timid about not getting to mass. That took care
of that, and we were friendly with the sisters, and we went there. Meanwhile,
I&#039;m talking to Father Carpentier, and the book that he gave me to read.

One day, the sisters asked us what we were going to do after the war and so
forth. Theresa said that I wanted to be a sister, and they were so surprised. It
had never come up in this time, because we had been meeting them for a couple of
months. They said, &quot;What about us?&quot; I said, &quot;No, because you&#039;re a teaching
community, and I&#039;m interested in&quot;--so they said, &quot;We do other kind of works.&quot; So
I did apply there. Sister Charles Edward was the general superior. She found it
difficult to see how I would qualify, that I didn&#039;t live with my family. That
seemed to be a problem. She kept asking. I tried to explain that the reason I
didn&#039;t live with my family was because of the job. Whether it was understood or
not, I don&#039;t know. I had to repeat that a couple of times going to see her. The
two sisters that I met were Sister Grace Catherine and Sister John Berchmans.
Later, she returned to her family name, was Mildred Meany.

Anyway, I went through the process, and then I entered the Sisters of Saint
Joseph. Later on, I often thought that I wouldn&#039;t have become a sister of Saint
Joseph--I mean, I became a sister of Saint Joseph because of my meeting them,
where I would not have met them had I not been living in Brentwood because of
working in Republic. So I always have a nice feeling about Republic for that. I
was very happy, and am happy, as a sister of Saint Joseph.

FARRELL: So you had been thinking for quite some time about becoming a sister?

LICHINCHI: Oh, yes, a long time.

FARRELL: Can you tell me a little bit more about that feeling of wanting to be a
sister while you were working in the factory during the war? Was that feeling
growing stronger during that period?

LICHINCHI: It was only going stronger to the extent that I felt I should be
doing something on it. It wasn&#039;t that it no longer interested me. But the nice
thing that happened--it was a very nice thing that happened, but strange at the
time. As I had said I didn&#039;t want to teach. The first day of normal
school--because that&#039;s how we were taught, was normal school--the sister, Sister
Francis Antonia, who was in charge of us--she was called the mistress of
postulants. That&#039;s while we were there, and then novices would be afterwards.
When she saw me that day that school opened, she said to me, &quot;I know you don&#039;t
want to go to normal school, but you should go.&quot; She said, &quot;You&#039;re a natural.&quot;
Whatever she meant by that, I don&#039;t know, but it was the greatest gift I could
have had, because my first day in the classroom, I knew it was for me. I just
loved it. That was a no that turned to a yes. A lot of them all my life. We all
had that. Things change. It was a good change for me, because I loved teaching,
I loved the education course that I had because of it. Had I not been, I
wouldn&#039;t have been in that direction. Then teaching the grade school, teaching
in grade school and high school.

Then I tried being a principal, but after two years--my first year, really--I
liked the thought of being a principal in the way teaching would take place, but
that wasn&#039;t possible. It was a lot of trying to change things, and you thought
you were doing it in a slow way so people get used to it. When I was principal,
my first year principal, when the child would be sent down to the principal&#039;s
office, I was not mostly involved in what happened. I didn&#039;t know what happened,
so I could be different in treating them than the person who went through the
experience that had to send them down. I understood that part of it, having been
in that place myself. They had them sit for a while, and then I would call them
in. I&#039;d say, &quot;Do you like coming down here?&quot; Usually the answer was no. I said,
&quot;What could you have done differently so that you wouldn&#039;t have come down here?&quot;
Because what we wanted to do was change their behavior. I rarely saw these
children again that way. People, some of them, felt I wasn&#039;t, I don&#039;t know,
punishing them or something. I don&#039;t know what they expected.

FARRELL: Before you moved into the sisterhood and you had these feelings of
wanting to do that--you had mentioned before that when you were working in the
factory, you didn&#039;t really care what your assignment was, and you just kind of
wanted to go home. Why did you choose to stay in the factory and continue to
work there for about a year?

LICHINCHI: Oh, because I was told, because most of the jobs were war-related, I
wouldn&#039;t get a job anyplace else. They call that blacklisted or something. It
was necessary. I needed a job. The war on the Europe side, in that theater,
ended faster than the one in the Japan theater. That was a year later. I just
forgot what I was going to say.

FARRELL: You were talking about leaving--

LICHINCHI: Oh, yes, that&#039;s right. They were letting people go that were not as
important for the job. Maybe they had too much of something and they didn&#039;t need
it, whatever. The supervisor who had originally said no, he came to me and said,
&quot;Are you still interested in leaving?&quot; I already was preparing to enter that
September. This was 1944, and I would say probably around February, because it
took a couple of months before it finally went through. He said, &quot;Are you still
interested?&quot; and I said yes. It was far better for him to let people go who were
interested in going than to tell other people to leave. As I said, I was going
to enter in September. The two sisters, Sister Grace Catherine and Sister John
Berchmans, we used to call them spiritual mothers. The person that really
sponsored us, and they would help us in buying the clothes that we needed and
all, and other things that we had to do to be ready. They took turns, and I
think Grace was a little more free with her scheduling or something. Then when I
left, I still needed money to get some more of the clothes that I needed and so
forth. Sister John Berchmans had a friend in the telephone company, and she
said, &quot;I could tell her that you&#039;re only going to need it for a couple of
months, if there&#039;s a way that you could work there.&quot; So I did work in the
telephone company, I would say maybe three or four months. They gave me the
simplest incoming job.

What was interesting, we were four groups in this big room, and I guess that was
to the level of experience that you had. The woman in charge that Sister John
Berchmans knew was related to one of the sisters that I later lived with. Nice
person. She was very nice. She said, &quot;I know your story,&quot; and she didn&#039;t say
anything to anyone, which was nice. When I left, the day that I left, she said,
&quot;There&#039;s another woman here that&#039;s going to the same community.&quot; She was Sister
Dorothy Fowler. She died fairly recently. She entered the same day I did, was
going to be the same group, but we didn&#039;t know it when we were there. It was
such a surprise when we found out. That&#039;s what happened then.

FARRELL: Can you tell me a little bit about your memories of the end of the
war?Were you already in the sisterhood when the war ended?

LICHINCHI: Yes. I lived in Brentwood. I was working at Republic. In Republic,
when I said to you earlier about how easy it was to be patriotic, when things
got boring, we&#039;d all be singing, &quot;Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.&quot; Who
would ever sing that, if you&#039;re thinking correctly? But it was different. It was
so natural. You had such a sense of pride. It was so different when you taught
about the Vietnam War and lived during that time as a teacher. That was a hard
time. In the sixties--that was the sixties--not only did you have the hard time
with the Vietnam War, to face it and face what was happening in our country to
people that didn&#039;t believe in it all and left. Drugs were very strong at that
time. The Catholic Church was going through the Second Vatican Council. At that
time also in the sixties, early sixties there, and mid-sixties, I was teaching
home economics in high school, Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Brooklyn. I taught
the marriage course there, too. I taught about family life. This young lady came
in with Time magazine, and on the cover, the picture, it was about two people
cohabitating. She came to me and she puts it right in my face, and she said,
&quot;Why get married? We don&#039;t have to get married.&quot; A lot of things happened that
were very threatening to a lot of what we had before comfortably.

FARRELL: What did you see change after World War II? That period between when
that happened and World War II. Basically, the dominant narrative, the
historical narrative that we&#039;ve all been taught, or at least I have, is that
women went out to work in World War II because they were helping the war effort,
and then in the fifties, it was a return to the household, and then the sixties
was kind of coming out of that. Immediately after that war period, what did you
see change, if anything?

LICHINCHI: I was a novice then, and it was different.

FARRELL: Did you see communities change? Even with new inventions. I know that
plastics came out.

LICHINCHI: Yes. Oh, the nylon stockings. They cost five dollars a pair at that
time. Everyone wanted a pair of nylon stockings. That was a big thing. Oh, the
first World Fair. I was a child then. That was before, before graduating from
high school. That was &#039;39, wasn&#039;t it? Thirty-six, &#039;39, in that area? That was in
Flushing, which is not far from where I lived. We went there many times, and we
were thrilled with all the wonderful things. You sat on a moving car. Not a car,
but like a train thing. You saw everything before you, what was going to happen.
I don&#039;t want to get my Worlds Fair mixed up, because we had another one later.
That was exciting. In fact, when my sisters were moving last year and they went
through their things, my sister had a spoon, a silver spoon, that must have
belonged to a set, which has some of the buildings from World&#039;s Fair. In fact, I
came across it the other day when I was looking for something else. I do know,
from the teaching, they started to build out in the suburbs. Then, of course,
the GI Bill of Rights and the people that went to be educated more. Newer
positions and new places to work came up. It&#039;s almost hard to say, because it
isn&#039;t exactly correct in the fact that it was after the war that we really
overcame the big Depression.

FARRELL: Can you tell me a little bit about what you want people to know about
the World War II era?

LICHINCHI: What I would like everyone to know about the war, that that is not
the answer to solving problems. In fact, when we went to the--they were honoring
us in 2007--they asked me to give the blessing. I called and I said, &quot;Why can&#039;t
you ask somebody else?&quot; She said, &quot;You&#039;re the only sister there, and we think
you should do it.&quot; Well, I did it. But in that, I did say, while we don&#039;t have
the energy to build the planes that we did before, I said I would like to spend
my time building a plane that would just drop goodwill. That&#039;s why, today, I
know it&#039;s a questionable thing and we don&#039;t know what&#039;s going to happen with the
Iran treaty--what is it? What do they call it?

FARRELL: It&#039;s a treaty.

LICHINCHI: Treaty. Well, no, it&#039;s not a treaty, it&#039;s a plan. Anyhow, whatever.
That is a way of solving a problem without going to war. We have to take the
risk someplace. We, as a country, do not have to prove to anyone that we have
the strength that we have. We should try to do something else. At the last
election--when Obama was first elected?

FARRELL: That was in 2008, and then the next one was in--

LICHINCHI: When I wrote, we didn&#039;t know who the president was going to be. I had
written to one of the news TV companies, and I had said that. Maybe we can learn
to solve problems in other ways. I don&#039;t mean that we should never take a stand
on something. I don&#039;t mean that. But we have to take a stand diplomatically. We
have to learn to solve problems in another way. It&#039;s terrible the people that
have died. You cannot look at a program today without seeing those people just
moving from place to place. It&#039;s just horrible. So we have to find another way
to solve it. Maybe it will come. But war is not the answer.

FARRELL: Aside from that, what was the biggest thing that you learned
personally, or about yourself, during that period of time?

LICHINCHI: During the war? The part would be I graduated in &#039;42. We were bombed
in Hawaii in December, the seventh, of &#039;41. There was one year of it that I was
still in school then. I remember a social studies teacher telling us--and not
the one that had said that he would kill himself if they lost the war. She
brought in the newspaper and she said, &quot;Reading the words is not enough. You
have to know what&#039;s behind it.&quot; Little things, but I&#039;m remembering. It&#039;s a long
time. I hope some of the kids remember some of the nice things that I taught.
You want me to go into my teaching?

FARRELL: This might be a good place to stop for today, unless you have anything
else that you want to add.

LICHINCHI: Oh, no. I&#039;m fine.

FARRELL: Thank you. [pause in recording] Okay, we&#039;re recording.

LICHINCHI: I would like to say something about being a sister, and why I&#039;m happy
to be one, and I know many others are. That is, I feel that the call that we all
have is to love who and what God loves, as God loves. I think we need that. I
think we, as sisters of Saint Joseph, and other communities also, do that in the
ministries that they&#039;re involved in. This is a good way also to close this
interview. Our ministries reveal how well we read the signs of the times. Sister
Helen Kearney, our president, recently captured them well in the following.

&quot;The sisters of Saint Joseph believe in the power and presence of a loving God,
active in our own world, for all time, and in this time. United with all who
minister with us, we seek to bring God&#039;s healing and reconciling love where it
has the greatest need. We minister in elementary schools, high schools,
colleges, universities, literacy programs, and religious education programs. We
use our ecology center and organic garden to foster a greater understanding of
our interconnectedness with all creation and the implications for our way of
living on this planet. We minister by providing shelter and protection for women
who have been abused and imprisoned, and for children whose mothers are
incarcerated. We nurture the spiritual and physical needs of many, through
parish and social outreach programs. We care for the sick and frail with
reverence and affection, in hospitals, residences for the elderly, and in Maria
Regina, our skilled nursing care facility. We advocate for social justice,
especially in areas of human trafficking, immigration, nonviolence, availability
to healthcare, affordable housing, and the sustainability of our planet and all
creation. In our daily living and through our ministries, we serve to counteract
ignorance, exclusion, and structures that oppress or deprive others of their
basic needs and dignity.&quot;

Why I want to end with that is, when I entered in 1944, the primary ministry was
teaching. We did have, at that time, nurses that staffed two hospitals, which
are no longer in existence, Saint Joseph&#039;s in Rockaway, and Saint John&#039;s in Long
Island City, and later in Elmhurst. When we see the world around us, and many
sisters either alone over the years--that&#039;s &#039;44 to today--over the years, some
sisters, and sometimes a group of sisters, took the great risk of testing the
waters to what else we could do to the people that we meet. Our charism is to
love God and to love our neighbor, without distinction. I think that&#039;s a
wonderful way to finish this interview. Thank you.
