Story_ID: 657827
Speaker 1: All right fantastic.  So, we're gonna begin by talking about your family.  And what you know about your family genealogy, okay?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, let's start on with your mother and your mother's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, tell me your mother's name?  Where she was born and what date she was born if you know it?  And spell her name for me please, okay?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother's name was Georgia Branch Dillard.  And G, G-E-O-R-G-I-A, of course Branch being the family name, and Dillard is when she married my stepfather, D-I-L-L-A-R-D [Mansfield Dillard].  My, my mother was born in Augusta, Georgia and to my, my grandparents.  Both were from Waynesboro.  My, my grandmother was Sadie Branch and my, my--Royal Branch [Sadie Royal Branch], and my grandfather was Her- Herbert Branch.
Speaker 1: What years was your mother born?
Speaker 2: My mother was born in 1922, August of 1922.
Speaker 1: All right, and since you, you went on with your grandparents, you said they lived Waynes- ?
Speaker 2: My mother, my grandmother lived in Waynesboro, Georgia, up in an area named McBean [Georgia] but all over because, the family was from Waynesboro, in the little part of the town Yellowtown.  And there were some many siblings on her side that it would take forever to name all of them and I didn't know all of them.
Speaker 1: Okay and do you, what, what do know about your, your grandparents on your--well let's stay with your grandmother first and then grandfather.  Did your grandmother work outside of the home or did, was she a homemaker?  And your grandfather as well, what did he do as an occupation?
Speaker 2: My grandmother, once they moved here to Savannah [Georgia] she became a domestic worker.  And she and my grandfather got a divorce.  He was a railroad man.  And he worked on the railroad all of his life.  There was a line that used to be called the Central of Georgia railroad [Central of Georgia Railway] here in the state and he was a part of the team that would go up and down between Savannah and Atlanta [Georgia] on the Nancy Hanks.  Other you know, trips that there were going as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you know about their education, how much education they had?
Speaker 2: My grandmother had a third grade education.  But, you would never had known that, you know, because she made sure that my sister [Margie Reid Williams] and, and I had a newspaper and books, and magazines and all.  'Cause she would bring them home from places that she worked, as well.  Because, education was so important to her.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your mother have siblings?
Speaker 2: One yes, one, my aunt Lillie Mae [Lillie Branch].  My aunt Lillie Mae was very much a part of my life because at the very early age of, of three, my grandmother sent my mother to her sister in Tampa, Florida, to find a job.  And my sister and I were supposed to remain here until she found that job and then we were going to move to Tampa.  But, my grandmother being the strong, strong matriarch that she was, she decided that we weren't going.  And she told my mom, "You work, and you send the money to take care of the girls, and I'll raise them."  And that is exactly what she did, along with the help of my aunt Lillie Mae and my Uncle Jewel [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay, did you mother share any stories about growing up?
Speaker 2: They were very, very, very poor.  My mother and my aunt grew up during the Depression [Great Depression] and after my grandfather and my grandmother got a divorce it was very, very hard.  You know, I hear the stories of my grandmother used to tell me.  I remember how she said that she had to go and beg for food.  But, back in those days you had neighborhoods and you had it where if one person had, everybody partake.  And she would tell me of how people offer her food, you know, when she would go by their house.  And she wouldn't eat because she knew that she had two girls.  And that they didn't have any food, and she had to make sure that they ate.
Speaker 1: So but, as your mother was when she was growing up, this is what was, this was before she had children that I'm asking about.  Did she share any stories about her childhood?
Speaker 2: Yes, she, she always talked about going to school and spending time mainly in the neighborhood.  Again, because that is where the security factor was.  Because, everyone in the household worked.  So, it was like the neighbors having to take care of her.  And my mother always worked as a cook, even as a little girl she worked for other people cooking for them.  My aunt in the same situation, you know they were, they worked as the domestics and as cooks.  But, at a- as a- at an early age I believe my mother finished high school, but my aunt did not finish high school.
Story_ID: 657828
Speaker 1: Are there any other relatives that you know about, or do you know any further back in your genealogy?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, my grandmother [Jackson's maternal grandmother, Sadie Royal Branch] had a brother, his na- his name was Nebuchadnezzar Royal [ph.].  And I found that out later in life.  But they called him Uncle Son.  And Uncle Son was, lived in Waynesboro, Georgia.  And if you remember there is a school that used to be there called Boggs Academy [Keysville, Georgia].  And my, my uncle was the kind of person that everybody looked up to.  He was a 33rd Degree Mason.  And a lot of the teachers that taught at Boggs Academy lived at his house, with he and his wife.  And so we would take trips from Savannah [Georgia] to Waynesboro and spend long weekends.  And you know, it was just a time when my mother [Georgia Branch Dillard] said they would the same thing growing up.  Because my aunt Rosie [ph.] and my aunt Willie [ph.] and, and all of them lived between Waynesboro and Augusta.  The funniest thing though about, my, my family on my grandmother's side is that there were fourteen of them, seven boys and seven girls, the men died early.  I remember my Uncle, Uncle Son dying in the '50s [1950s], and I'll never forget it.  Because during those days they would bring the body to the house.  And the peo- neighbors would come around and they would sit with the body.  And I'll never forget we stayed in his house that night.  And the room that we slept in, we could look right over and see the coffin and all of that.  Because, you know, he was so recognized in the community and so everybody wanted to come by.  I guess it was frightening, but was also very peculiar for us to exp- to have those kinds of experiences.  And also, one of my other aunts on my, my grandmother's side, Aunt Willie, didn't do much work except as a domestic as most people were.  But, her husband was the ice man in Waynesboro, Georgia.  He had an ice truck with the mule and everything and he sold ice in the neighborhood.  And we used enjoy going to visit her because Aunt Willie had old--one of the old wood stoves.  And she would cook biscuits and all of that on the wood stove and as time evolved she got a, a gas stove, but she still cooked on the wood stove.  So, we were little at the time and we would take train and go up to visit them.  Because my mother was in Tampa [Florida] and my, my aunt was here.  And then you know, and then my aunt Rosie [ph.] who was my favorite great aunt, you know.  She, she was the non-conformist, everyone said that I have, I had a lot of way, a lot of ways like her, you know.  And she was her own, she was, Aunt Rosie was a woman in her own right, right, you know.  She lived in, in Augusta, and had the most wonderful husband and she worked for a family in Augusta, who bought a home for them, on 4th Street in Augusta, Georgia.  And we used to go up there and Aunt Rosie had a, a pear tree in her backyard.  Now and she would climb on top of the, the house and pull the pears and everything off the tree so we could bring them back to Savannah.

Speaker 1: All right and so your dad, on your dad's side?
Speaker 2: On my father's side I really didn't know.  Later on in life in 2000--I knew my dad but I didn't know my dad.  My dad used to hang with my uncle, my uncle Jewel [ph.], who was like a father to me.  And I was my father's outside child.  And my dad would come around and would always make promises and never would fulfill them and my grandmother [Jackson's maternal grandmother, Sadie Royal Branch] would always say, "Honey you don't have worry about, about that, you have us."  And I knew I met a brother [Walter Reid] in my early age.  And he knew he had a sister and of course in my later years we found each other.
Speaker 1: What was your father's name?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Henry Reid.  And I do know that he was from South Carolina.  And but as far as--I only know what my brother has said about, told me about him.  I know that he drank a lot and I know he drank with my uncle Jewel.  And I knew where to find them, you know, in the afternoons, on weekends.  But, my uncle Jewel was a goo- oh he was such a sweet man.
Story_ID: 657830
Speaker 1: He was your uncle?
Speaker 2: He was ma- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How was he--he was married to?
Speaker 2: He was married to my mother's sister [Lillie Branch].  My uncle Jewel [ph.] from an area outside of Waynesboro [Georgia] called Sardis, Georgia.  And you could tell that he was, his, someone in his family was white.  My uncle Jewel is about 6'5" with straight curly hair, you know.  And but the funniest thing you know, he carried me everywhere he would go.  That's how I got a chance to go to the moonshine houses, 'cause my grandmother [Jackson's maternal grandmother, Sadie Royal Branch] didn't want me going with him.  But, he'd say, "Come on little mama."  But, he looked after us.  And he worked for a company now that is called, was Union Can, no Continental Can [Continental Can Company].  And every day he would come home and you know, we would sit and he would have that newspaper.  And in later years I found out that my uncle would say, "Come on little mama," that was my nickname, that he had for me.  He'd say, "Come on little mama let's go do this," or, "Let's go do that."  If I saw him on the corner my sister [Margie Reid Williams] and I'd say, "Uncle Jewel can we go over to Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] and get something?" Of course my aunt didn't know about it then, 'til she got the bill.  He'd say, "Y'all go over there and get what y'all want."  But, that's how our family was.  Mind you now, my mother [Georgia Branch Dillard] was sending the money every two weeks, to take care of my sister and me.  She, she made that comi- -mitment and every two weeks she would send that money to my grandmother.  But, my uncle Jewel now, he was just there for us, you know.  And let me tell you a little story about my uncle Jewel every day, you know my grandmother always saw to it that we had a newspaper.  So, she subscribed--she only had a third grade education--she subscribed to the Savannah Morning News.  And you had the morning news and the evening press [Savannah Evening Press], but we took the Morning News.  And mama would always, and I always called her mama, mama would always have us to sit down to read, 'cause she wanted us the learn to read.  And so, my uncle Jewel would sit down and he would read the newspaper, except that one day he was looking at the sports section and I said, "Uncle Jewel," he [sic.] said, "why you reading the newspaper upside down?"  And said, "Oh okay little mama, see I was just trying to see if you were paying attention."  He would say, "Now that you so--," you know, he would tell me I was the, well I was the bad one in the family, (laughter).  He didn't call me bad, mischievous.  Later on he would say, "Now read this story here to me," and would be about the Brooklyn Dodgers [Los Angeles Dodgers], but it encouraged me to read.  Later on in life I found out he couldn't read, he could count money, but he couldn't read.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And I found that out.
Story_ID: 657831
Speaker 1: All right so, you're living with your grandmother and grandfather [Jackson's maternal grandparents, Sadie Royal Branch and Herbert Branch] and I want you to describe the house that you lived in.
Speaker 2: Oh I would love to do that.  Now, remember my grand- my grandmother and my grandfather had gotten a divorce.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it was my grandmother and of course my, my aunt [Lillie Branch], my uncle and my sister [Margie Reid Williams].  And then my aunt and uncle moved out into a house themselves.  But, I came up in a house, and I tell this story all the time to children.  Because they see you in a position and they think you always had.  We lived in a little house at 605 West Bolton Street.  It was a house that had no indoor plumbing the restroom, well the bathroom, the toilet, was in the backyard.  And you know, back in those days, the toilets were always away from the house.  We had no indoor running water.  On our back porch we had a faucet, and that is where we would go with the bucket to fill the bucket so that we could have running water in the house.  We could have the water in the house with a dipper.  Now, you couldn't drink off that dipper, you had to get a glass.  And the glass was usually the jelly glass.  You know, if they had jelly, gr- apple jelly, then that becomes your water glass.  And you, we, we, we didn't have, we didn't know how poor we were.  And when I found out how poor we, I really was, my grandmother was involved in PTA [Parent Teacher Association] and all of those kinds of things.  And she allowed us to have our friends over to the house; my sister was older.  And I'll never forget one of my classmates came to my house.  And he had to go the bathroom and I just directed him to the yard.  And he went back to school that day, I was in elementary school [Florence Street School, Savannah, Georgia], and he told everybody that our bathroom was in the bath- in the backyard.  So, I was a fighter and so I just beat him up.  I did, I did, I did, I, I know, god, my teacher wrote, "Edna's [HistoryMaker Edna Jackson] a very nice young lady but she has a fiery temper."  And I did but you know, we had a wood stove and in house until we got the gas stove.  And we had to bathe, my sister and I had to bathe in a tin tub.  I think they were number threes.  And my grandmother would heat the water on the wood stove that also served as our heater, other than when we got the little kerosene heaters.  And she would heat that water and put it in the tin tub.  And my sister and I would bathe together in the tin tub.  The soap was made by my aunt, lye soap.  A lot of people don't even know what that is, they used to take that lye and make that soap and that's what we had to bathe with.  Because cleanliness was so important you know, we didn't have much but the floors were clean, we got linoleums twice a year.  My grandmother bought them in the spring and in the fall, you know, you have Christmas and all of that.  That's when you got the linoleum, and they took down the curtains; you had to wash the little curtain and do all of that.  But, my life, I am blessed because coming up in my neighborhood I lived on a street, on Bolton Street, in the lane you had a lot of the moonshine houses.  But, people sat on the front porches.  They used to call them stoops back then.  And they would talk to each other from one side to the other.  So, I was skinny and I became, the, the runner for everybody else to go to the grocery store and pick up stuff (laughter).  And as you would do that, I had to run down that street, I, I, and I would run I wouldn't walk.  I would say, "Hi Miss Lula Allen [Lula Allen Ruffin], how you doing Ms. Georgia Reid [ph.], Hey Miss Funny [ph.]," going down and coming back and if I missed somebody they was say, "Sadie Branch's child didn't speak to me today."  I knew I had spoken and my grandmamma because of the way that she raised us you had to speak.  So, the thing was, I had to get the chinaberry switch off the tree, for her to whip me.
Story_ID: 657832
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In my neighborhood I--next door was my god- my sister's godmother's house, which was a rooming house.  It was a three story house.  We eventually moved in that house because she was an old lady, and she asked my grandmother [Jackson's maternal grandmother, Sadie Royal Branch] if she would take over the house, because health reasons.  And we had a bathroom.  We had a not only that, we had indoor running water, we had lights, we had a furnace, we had everything.  And we had people she turned over all of her roomers to my grandmother.  So, that was who we were able to pay the rent 'cause we took care of her house.  And that was 609 West Bolton [Street], very next door.  But, in growing up we would always go around her and she would correct us.  You know, if we used ain't or whatever, our, our English wasn't perfect she would correct us.  And you would have thought, she looked like a little old white lady.  And her name was Mrs. Jackman [ph.] and her husband was a merchant seaman.  But, people corrected us back in those days, and I appreciated--but back in those days, because I was the way I was, my sister [Margie Reid Williams] was the goody two shoe, people saw something that I didn't see in myself and that's a whole new conversation.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: All right.  So, going back to your classmate going to school [Florence Street School, Savannah, Georgia] and telling them that your bathroom was outside.  Until that point, did you think everybody's bathroom was outside?
Speaker 1: No, I didn't know that, I mean I did know that there were indoor bathrooms and outdoor bathroom.  But, he made fun of my family.
Speaker 2: Were--you weren't the only family that had outdoor bathroom were you?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But his mother was a school teacher.  And he was known to be the jokester.  He died in prison, you know, but it was that kind of thing that you know it was very touching for me back in those days.  'Cause I loved my life, it didn't matter you know, yes when we moved upstairs, and in the--had a bathroom.  Boy we, we had a riot.  But you know it didn't make him no better than I was.  To tell you the truth I had more than he had, than he had, 'cause I had love.  I had, we had a family unit.  My grandmother would, would scrub the front porch with--porch with potash and she would have those little, have you ever heard of a four o'clock?  It's a flower that would only bloom at four o'clock in the afternoon, because the streets of course were dirt.  So mother would try and grow a little garden we had the little stuff, we had our little flowers and stuff like that.
Speaker 2: Who were some of your friends in, in your neighborhood?  And what types of occupations did your friends' parents have?
Speaker 1: Anywhere from being school teachers to people that were--just their husbands worked, ministers lived in my neighborhood.  And I--some of the kids went to Catholic school.  And their parents had confectionaries and all of that.  But, they didn't look down on us.  'Cause we were clean and we had this lady that made a lot of the clothes, Easter stuff for us, you know Ms. Allen, Ms. Lula Allen [Lula Allen Ruffin].   So, we didn't miss out on anything because we were very pristine.  When we walked out of the door you didn't know that we didn't have a bathroom in our house.  And god knows you couldn't smell.
Story_ID: 657833
Speaker 1: Well the--speaking of smells, when you think about the sounds, and sights and smells what comes to your memory?
Speaker 2: I came up in the church and I was--I always loved hymns and anthems because I came up in the African Me- Methodist Episcopal church.  And then I, I enjoyed singing and you know, whenever I hear nice music.  And as time evolved in my life and going back and forth to Tampa [Florida].  See my mother [Georgia Branch Dillard], my mother really, you know, she came into her own, she remarried [to Mansfield Dillard] and she opened her own restaurant.  But, there are times when she wasn't married and we would go visit her.  And so, the smell of food and her cooking, I--it always made me remember things, I (unclear)--my aunt's biscuits.  Now, my grandmamma [Jackson's maternal grandmother, Sadie Royal Branch] wasn't that much of a cook.  But, my aunt [Lillie Branch] and my mom were cooks.
Speaker 1: What about sights and sounds, well the sounds you told me, the hymns, okay.  And, what about sights?
Speaker 2: I like the sight of--it's not a sight in as much as it's people.  I like to see people and I, what is very endearing to me is to see my old classmates and people that I grew up with.  And I guess we were poor, but we were kind of sheltered too.  You know, because we weren't allowed do certain things.  And but, to see them and you know, just looking at some old pictures, there is a young lady here by the name of Kim [ph.] that's going to do an interview with me on, tomorrow.  I found the picture of her mama at my third birthday party.  And I found with her mama and her aunt at my sister's birthday party.  'Cause everybody in the neighborhood--you just have a birthday party and everybody shows up, you know.  And so people, the sight of people.
Story_ID: 657834
Speaker 1: Let's talk about elementary school.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your school, who was the principal and do you have any favorite teachers that you remember?
Speaker 2: Oh Lord yes.  I went to Florence Street elementary school [Florence Street School, Savannah, Georgia].  And I'm having a senior moment, I can't remember the principal's name.
Speaker 1: That's fine.
Speaker 2: Mrs. Edwards [Willie Grant Edwards], and it was not the school that I was supposed to go thr- to, but my grandmother didn't like the school I was supposed to go to.  And she talked the principal in letting me come to Florence elementary school.  And I walked to school every day.  And so, I had friends and we would go and I would walk, we would pick up other friends until we got school.  And I'll never forget my, my first grade teacher was a Mrs. Presley [ph.].  And Mrs., Mrs. Presley was a very fair complexioned lady.  And you see I came up in a time, in a time when I was not supposed to survive.  And I often tell kids this, because, we were very, very, very poor.  The other thing I was con- I was dark.  And back in the day, even back in the day, the students that were given everything to do were mostly the kids that were fair complexioned.  And the other thing is was--I was a female.  But, I was one that had so much energy until people couldn't help but see me.  And so, my teachers and my Sunday school teachers and everything took all that energy and helped me to develop who I am--to develop who I am today.  They would make me learn all of the long speeches in Sunday school, and there was a lady that was there, my Sunday school teacher--I can't think of her name, it will come.  But, she would always just pick me out to do things.  And I would be defiant, but I had to do it, okay.  And then when I went to school my teachers were like that.  They saw, like I said, they saw something in me.  There were some teachers by the name of Mrs. Owens [ph.], Mrs. Ann Farrell Johnson and Mrs. Mildred Johnson [ph.].  And Mrs. Ann Farrell Johnson used to wear braids on top of her head.  And, but they would always want me to learn all these poems and stuff.  And I got tired of it, and when I was in fourth grade I had this fourth grade teacher Miss Rainey [ph.] and she gave me this poem to learn and I knew the poem and 'cause my grandmother made sure 'cause she was in PTA [Parent Teacher Association], so the teachers knew her.  So, I told her I didn't know the poem and of course by the time I got home my grandmamma knew I didn't say the poem.  And I had to get the chinaberry switch off the tree--tree, because I had been disrespectful.  And, for me to get, you know, for her to whip me.  Okay, so she said, "Why didn't you say it?"  I said, "I didn't feel like it."  Oh, that's why I got the switch off the tree.  So, I went back to school the next day, and Mrs. Rainey said, "Edna [HistoryMaker Edna Jackson], I need you to say your poem."  So, I stood up and I was very tiny, they said if you turned me sideways you couldn't see me.  And I stood up and my eyes were always small and I would squint them and she said, "Open those eyes."  And I said, "Tell me not in mournful numbers / Life is but an empty dream" ['A Psalm of Life,' Henry Wadsworth Longfellow].  And I went on and on, and she said, "If you don't take hands off your hip," (laughter), she said, "I'm gonna send you home to Sadie Branch [Jackson's maternal grandmother, Sadie Royal Branch]."  So, I had to take (gesture) and apologize for that too.  But, what I'm saying to you is that I survived a lot because of the teachers that took me under their wings and people in the neighborhood that took me.  Because they took that energy that I had and they made a positive.  And so, I became the leader in school.  I was the president of the school council in elementary school and junior high school [Cuyler Junior High School; Alfred E. Beach High School, Savannah, Georgia].  You know, I was, and that something, because the school were segregated.  If you were in the class officers, then there was these, there were these teachers, on Saturday they would have all of the officers from all of the school around to come.  And we had to go and that's how we'd learn Robert's Rules of Order, how to carry a meeting, do all of that thing.  Well, you know I was going to be in charge, you know, I had to do all those things, and I did them.  And it was--I didn't realize all the things until after, you know, I had continued to grow up, and what they were doing.  And so, my elementary school years I was very active in whatever they told me to do.
Story_ID: 657835
Speaker 1: And so, you were in, you went to school about 1950, and then 1954, 1955, was supposed to start desegregation of schools.  So, tell me what happens when you go from elementary school [Florence Street School, Savannah, Georgia], did you go to a junior high school or did you go to high school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah. All the schools, we, we didn't have integration here in Savannah [Georgia] until the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that, that's a part of the story as well.  Now, when I was nine years old my sister [Margie Reid Williams] took piano lessons from this man, and, Peter J. Smalls [Peter Smalls].  And my grandmother [Jackson's maternal grandmother, Sadie Royal Branch] always wanted us to play piano, so she bought a piano and my sister took the lesson.  And he hit me and I wasn't going no more.  So, my grandm- I took dance, at the May Street Y, Y, well no the West Broad Street YMCA [Savannah, Georgia], from this man named James Wiley [ph.].  And he taught all kinds, toe dance, jazz you named it and I took it.  But, at the age of nine my grandmother marched me to the West Broad Street YMCA and she knew that if I, if she didn't get somebody to you know, take charge of me and get me a, you know, do some of the other things in the community, that she had something on her hands.  So, she sent me to the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and my life was history from that day forward at the age nine I met Westley Wallace--Wallace Law [W.W. Law] and it changed my life.

Speaker 1: Tell us you--we know that W.W. Law is a very famous NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] president back in the day.  So, tell us what happened because for a nine year old--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --what was there for you to do at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, one thing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what year--let me see, this, what, what year would that have been?
Speaker 2: That was in 19--I was born in '44 [1944] so it had to be in '52 [1952].
Speaker 1: Fifty-one [1951], nine, '53 [1953], okay.
Speaker 2: Two [1952], '53 [1953], one of those years.  Anyway, yeah, the one thing he did, Mr. La- Mr. Law had a way of telling you about your history, you know, his one thing was, you don't, can't, can't, you can't join the NAACP unless you knew the history of the NAACP.  And you had to know history because it wa- they weren't, they weren't teaching it in schools in those days.  You heard a little bit of you know, about (unclear) you know, some of the teachers would tell you some of things. Booker T. Washington.  Everybody knew about Booker T. Washington and George Washington Carver.  But, he made us learn history.  And he would lecture us.  And then we had to give it back to him, you know, in another form.  But, I was so mesmerized with this man until I stuck with him all through the years, even through high school [Alfred E. Beach High School, Savannah, Georgia].  And as I went through junior high school [Cuyler Junior High School, Savannah, Georgia] here were another set of teachers that saw something in me.  And I became you know, we were in, we were supposed to be the smart kids, you know.  But, we were devilish, yeah and so.  But, they pushed us and I was still being pushed.  And there were other kids whose mothers were the school teachers and all of that but I could hang and I stood right there with them.
Speaker 1: Okay, what were some of the activities, once you learned the history, what were some of the things that you, you know, were a part of?  What type of activities did they have, that you were a part of?
Speaker 2: We would put on plays in the NAACP.  What I really didn't get to know--I knew a lot of the history, and he was preparing us for junior high school, but I was still a, you know, a kid at that time.  But, I was also building my life, because, I was becoming class vice presidents and presidents and, and all of that.  And still doing those things that teachers wanted me to do.  But, Mr. Law would meet with us and now our Youth Council was growing, at the time.  My real involvement of what Mr. Law was preparing us for was in 1960, when--I went to high school in '59 [1959].  And by then we had a well-organized NAACP Youth Council.  And we were learning a lot of history but, we were still living, living in a segregated city, where the lunch counters were segregated.  You had to go to the back of the bus, back in those days.  Or you had three restrooms: white men, white women, and colored.  You had two water fountains, one that was cool for white people, and just faucet water for black people.  So, he was telling us all about this and the injustices that al- that was happening in those days.  And we were becoming more, and more, and more progressive.
Story_ID: 657837
Speaker 1: So, I guess, junior high school, I made it through junior high school.  I did get put out of school when I was in junior high school.
Speaker 2: What junior high school did you go to?
Speaker 1: I went to Cuyler Junior High School [Savannah, Georgia].  And we were taking algebra and I was always an excellent math student.  That was supposed to have been my major in college [at Savannah State College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia].  And I'll never forget.  Two of my friends, Anise McKinney [ph.], whose mother worked at Cuyler, and Doris West [ph.], whose mother was a vi- was a visiting teacher.  You know, for in the home.  Well, we had a substitute teacher, and he didn't know his algebra and of course we were wild and fast and all that.  And we were standing up there doing this (gesture) and you know and telling him, "You're wrong," and stuff like that (laughter).  Mr. Oliver [ph.] was his name (laughter), and you never those, those events.  And the principal walked in Mr., Mr. Dwight [Arthur Dwight], he said, "Edna [HistoryMaker Edna Jackson], you go home to Ms. Branch [Jackson's maternal grandmother Sadie Royal Branch] and don't you come back until she comes back with you."  And (unclear) told Anise and them to go their mother too.  Well, I went but I wasn't going to tell Sadie Branch that I couldn't go back to school.  So, the next morning--my grandmother always, she always knew when something was wrong.  So, I didn't get up--she always prepared a hot breakfast for my sister [Margie Reid Williams] and me.  By this time my sister was in high school.  She always prepared us, she's, so I say, "Mama, I can't go to school today."  So, you weren't sick and you weren't dead.  So, she--so the only thing she said, "What did you do?"  And I said, "Well Mr. Dwight said you had to come to school."  She said, "Lord have mercy."  Of course that was an old phrase back in those days.  So, she put her clothes on and she took me back to school.  And Mr. Dwight told her what I did.  And I had to apologize to him, to the class, to the teacher and I had to get the switch off the tree.  And she told him that, "If you had--" that, "Edna wasn't raised that way.  If you have any other problems out of her, just take her little behind and whip her little behind."  So, I didn't do that no more.  But, our class was so devilish you know.  And we were, we were all in elementary school [Florence Street School, Savannah, Georgia] and junior high school, and all, and we would--I fought in junior high school too.  Yeah, I would--you, in my neighborhood you better fight, you know.  I didn't start the fights but people would pick on me.  The guys would pick on me because I was sort of heavy you know, in the chest part.  I was skinny and they would pick on and they would pinch me and stuff, like that, and I would turn around I sla- slapped them so you, you can imagine, had a bad temper, very bad temper.  So, but junior high school, the teachers there.  There was one teacher Catherine Mathis that took me--the first day we went to school we had on lipstick, she marched--she and this other teacher marched us all to the bathroom and made us wash our faces.  'Cause we were not supposed to have on lipstick, not in junior high school.  And of course we didn't wear it again.  But she took me under her wings, and she followed me all through high school [Alfred E. Beach High School, Savannah, Georgia].  This lady nurtured me so much that I would just go and stay in her house.  And she would send me down with her check to pay her bills.  Get a cab for me, she said, "If they say anything to you, you just tell them I told you to come."  And then she would tell me, "Go buy yourself something."  But I would always bring her her money back.  And they kept me involved in things, and, then high school.
Story_ID: 657838
Speaker 1: Okay, involved in what types of thing?
Speaker 2: Student government again.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: SLAGs, SLAGs were student library, li- Student Librarian Assistants of Georgia [sic. Student Library Assistants of Georgia], which made me work in the library.  So, therefore what did I learn, I had to learn the Dewey Decimal System [Dewey Decimal Classification], so that I would be able to file the books away.  And my seventh grade teacher became the librarian over at the school, at the, the, junior high school [Cuyler Junior High School; Alfred E. Beach High School, Savannah, Georgia].  So, I loved her to death, and she's still living.  She lives in Atlanta, Georgia.  Her name is Mrs. Doris Pettigrew Little.  And, one day when I as in Atlanta I called her.  And said, "My name is Edna Branch Jackson [HistoryMaker Edna Jackson], and you wrote on my report card that, 'Edna's a very nice young lady, but she had a fire- she has a fiery temper.'  Since seventh grade I've never forgotten that."  And she said, "Oh you know, and all," and we, she then remembered us, you know.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  I wanted to ask you, you talked about visiting teachers.  Explain to me what a visiting teacher was?
Speaker 2: That was, a visiting teacher, if a child was homebound and could not come to school because of an illness, then that person, that teacher went out so that that child could still learn while they were in, while they were, you know, away from school.  And that's what she was, Mrs. West [ph.] was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 657839
Speaker 1: So, you go on to high school.
Speaker 2: High school.
Speaker 1: And what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Alfred Ely Beach High School [Alfred E. Beach High School, Savannah, Georgia] (laughter).
Speaker 1: How many high schools for black students were in your community?
Speaker 2: At the time there were only two, Alfred Ely Bre- Beach and Tompkins [Tompkins High School; Woodville-Tompkins Technical and Career High School, Savannah, Georgia].  And I, I went to Beach High Sch- I started at Beach in 1959, tenth grade.  And who was my tenth grade teacher?  No it wasn't Mrs. Maybury [ph.], can't remember her na- yeah, Mrs. Maybury was my tenth grade teacher, homeroom, homeroom teacher.  Again, you know, your life goes with you.  And like people--I've always said to young people, someone will always watch you.  And it was those teachers that saw, again, something in me.
Speaker 1: How were you academically what, what were you favorite subjects and--
Speaker 2: Math.
Speaker 1: Math?
Speaker 2: I loved math.  And I loved scie- the sciences.  You know, when I was in school--high school, and it started with junior high school [Cuyler Junior High School, Savannah, Georgia], too.  I took biology, chemistry, physics, geometry, trigonometry, algebra.  And back then they were not teaching calculus in the schools.  But, I have a, I had a math teacher Mrs. Wynn [Virginia Wynn], and our teachers would teach us those things that were not in the book.  Remember in the segregated school system all of our books came--were hand me downs from the white schools.  And so, they were very creative and even in our biology you know, we had, we had the, we had to dissect the, the, the, what do you call it, the cat--the frog, the frog, dissect the frog.  And in that they would put you in groups, you didn't have your own frog.  But, you had to touch that frog, you know, you had to make sure, in that formaldehyde you know, and all that stuff.  So, you had to, you had to learn the parts of the frog.  Not only did you have learn the parts of the frog you had to learn all of the bones in the body, all of the muscles and everything, what connected to what.  And those were the things that we were responsible, so we were well prepared.  And so, in tenth grade, you know, I loved science and I loved math 'cause I had taken algebra, in, in junior high school.  And so, I was ready for the courses.  The funniest thing though, the teacher that was my math teacher, when my son [Kevan Jackson] went to school, she was at Savannah State [Savannah State College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia].  And I had to refresh myself so I could teach him, you know when he went on to, to school.  But, I enjoyed just about all--oh, civics.  I always wanted to know about government.  Again, because this is something that Mr. Law [W.W. Law] talked about.  You know, how people should be involved in government.  How you should become a registered voter and those kinds of things.  And again, because I was a--the vice president of, of my class you know, I was involved in everything.  Drama.  I don't know, I was able to survive, 'cause you had to get good grades.
Speaker 1: Did you not get good grades?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah (makes sound). I didn't want the chinaberry switch off the tree.  You had to have good grades.
Story_ID: 657840
Speaker 1: And besides drama, was there any other activities and, besides the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], were there any other--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very much in the church.
Speaker 1: Church, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, and then I was a SLAG [Student Library Assistants of Georgia] and then you know you had the 4-H club, and all of organizations.  But, by the time I got to high school, I was so involved in NAACP, until it became my activities.  And I knew that if, when we were meeting, we were hearing about what was happening in, in North Carolina.  I wanted to be a part, our Youth Council [NAACP Youth Council] because of the strength of the Youth Council, we wanted to march.  We wanted to sit in too.  Now, I was in tenth grade.  And so, we went back and told the NAACP that we wanted to sit in.  And of course Mr. Law [W.W. Law] before we could sit in we had to know why, the why.  We had to be trained.  We had to go through all of the training sessions of what you did, how did you protect yourself, because of the nonviolent movement.  Well, when we started here, March 16, 1960.  We had been put through this rigid stuff and my grandmother [Jackson's maternal grandmother, Sadie Royal Branch], told my grandmother I wanted to go and be a part of the demonstrations.  And my grandmother didn't want me to go 'cause she thought I would fight.  And I said, well, I wasn't gonna do that, 'cause you know, I believed in what I was doing.  And so, she called my mama [Georgia Branch Dillard], my mother, and mama told her, said, "Well, whatever you think for her."  So, I said, "Mama I'm not gonna--I promise you."  But, in order to prepare me they wouldn't let me sit in the first day.  I was the lookout.  And I (unclear)--so my grandmother asked my neighbor who lived across the street, Mercedes, Mercedes [Mercedes Wright Arnold], to go down there and look after me 'cause they thought I was gonna fight.  And I went down and I did what I was supposed to do.  But, lo and behold, Mercedes becomes a part of the movement (laughter).  It was so funny.  So, then she became involved and she because the sweetheart of the movement.  So, it was history after that.  And as a result of that, my girlfriend Carolyn Quilloin Coleman and Joan Tyson [Joan Tyson Hall], Ernest Robinson, were the first people arrested here in the City of Savannah [Georgia].  They were a part of Otis' [HistoryMaker Otis Johnson] class, the class of 1960 of Alfred Ely Beach High School [Alfred E. Beach High School, Savannah, Georgia].  Carolyn and I stuck with the movement.  Carolyn went on to Savannah State [Savannah State College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia] and continued her work with the NAACP there in the Youth Council.  Of course I, I was at Beach, I didn't graduate until 1962.  So, I still continued my work with the NAACP, sitting in, kneeling in, we knelt in at the churches.  I got arrested at Tybee [Tybee Island, Georgia], because you could not go to the beaches here.  And so I had to go to the, I went out there to swim in the water.  And they arrested me for disrobing in public.  But, I didn't disrobe, we had to go, we were prepared with our swimsuits on and then as we were getting to get, you know, to go into the water we just took off the tops we had to run for the water.  People would run out of the water, (laughter) it was so funny.  I went to jail, we stayed overnight and we sang freedom songs (singing), "Wade in the wa- wade," we, we made a song.  (Singing), "Wade in Tybee, wade in Tybee, children, wade in Tybee, brown skins wade in Tybee," that's like 'Wade in the Water.'  Okay, so we would go and just by chance they hadn't lined up for the lawyers to get us out of jail.  So, it ended up--and my grandmamma didn't know that I was going to wade in Tybee.  And I stayed overnight, in the, in the jail house, I have a brick here that the City of, of Tybee gave me when I became mayor [of Savannah, Georgia], when they tore, tore down the old jail house.  They gave me one--a brick that they painted from that old jail house.  That was such an honor.
Story_ID: 657841
Speaker 1: What, what year was this?
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: How old were you?  Were you in high school [Alfred E. Beach High School, Savannah, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: No, I was in college [Savannah State College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: No, I had gone and that's another way.  My house ma- my life made so many turns.  I had got to come--I have to get myself together on these kinds of thoughts.  'Cause I didn't I never kept things, and I lost a lot of stuff when my house burned.  In 19--1960, we were doing the wade-ins, not the wade-ns.  We were doing the sit-ins the, the worshipping at the churches here in Savannah [Georgia].  And we started, yeah, yeah, I think it was the wade-ins, that we started too.  'Cause there is a time in my life when after I went to college, I dropped out.  But, that's another long story.
Story_ID: 657842
Speaker 1: Let's finish the, the years in high school [Alfred E. Beach High School, Savannah, Georgia] and some of your activities.  So, what other things were you involved in--
Speaker 2: I was in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in high school?
Speaker 2: While I was in high school I was in the drama group.  And if you--they were gonna make you learn everything, you may as well be drama.  So, I was in, in the, the, we were thespians.  And I was in several of the productions.  But, one of the things that, that, that I enjoyed while I was in high school.  And I know you mentioned this, no, that was in junior high school [Cuyler Junior High School, Savannah, Georgia], I enjoyed Shakespeare [William Shakespeare].  And it carried over into high school.  And we had to learn in high school but did it in another way.  There was a, a writer that wrote Shakespeare in story form ['Tales from Shakespeare'].  And we would read in story form then we had to read it in the Old English.  You know, "When the hurlyburly's done" ['Macbeth,' William Shakespeare] but if you didn't know what you're reading, if you didn't read it.  Charles [Charles Lamb] and Mary Lamb I believe were the authors at the time that we had to read it in story form.  And I was in the choir, I always love to sing.  And I had, back in the day, a first soprano voice.  So, I enjoyed doing that, it was doing that or, I wasn't gonna do piano or, you know, I wasn't gonna do that.  So, and my grandmamma [Jackson's maternal grandmother, Sadie Royal Branch] made me stay busy.  By that time she was an officer in the PTA [Parent Teacher Association] (laughter).  So, it was NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], drama.
Speaker 1: Okay, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And there was a poem, 'The Psalm of Life' [sic. 'A Psalm of Life,' Henry Wadsworth Longfellow] is the name of the other poem, in elementary school [Florence Street School, Savannah, Georgia].
Story_ID: 657843
Speaker 1: So, at this time in, in high school, were you thinking about college?  Was this something that was on your mind that you knew that you would go to college?  Were you what were you thinking you would after high school?
Speaker 2: Oh, you didn't have choice.  Not in Sadie Branch's household [Jackson's maternal grandmother, Sadie Royal Branch].  My sister [Margie Reid Williams] knew that she was going to college.  And when she finished Beach [Alfred E. Beach High School, Savannah, Georgia] in '59 [1959], she went to Savannah State [Savannah State College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia].  So, I knew that when I finished Beach that I was going to go to Savannah State.  Well, during the Civil Rights Movement, I, I learned, I wa- I was so involved, until I became involved on the state level of NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  And my first national convention was in Atlanta, Georgia.  And we had to live on Clark's campus [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], 'cause it's--nothing was integrated back then.  At--I'll never forget Mr. Law [W.W. Law] and Gene Gadsden [Eugene Gadsden] and that's the other person, very dear to me in my life.  They would make me sit, they would make us sit in the meetings.  And you know, back in those days, we wanted to party like the other kids from the other chapters.  And I'll never forget, when I in ele- tenth grade or eleventh grade, one of the regional meetings was in Augusta, Georgia, at--on Paine's campus [Paine College].  And we were living in the dormitories and that they told us we were going out one night, they told us we had to go out with a, a upper classroom.  Well, I wasn't a student there, you know.  So, so then when I was looking at colleges, Paine recruited me.  And I wasn't gonna go there.  'Cause I had an experience right there, you know, with them.  And so, but my exposure in 1960 was to the schools in Atlanta.  And I knew my parents could not afford to, to send me off to school.  You know, unless I had a scholarship or something.  And I didn't want to go off, 'cause I wanted to stay here and demonstrate.  So, in 1960 at the convention I had the pleasure of meeting Floyd McKissick, that built Soul City in North Carolina.  I met his daughters Jocelyn McKissl- McKissick [Jocelyn Daszelle McKissick], and Andree [Andree McKissick].  And we built relationships.  And I met Kelly Alexander's son [Kelly Alexander, Jr.].  And it was through those relationships that I learned that, at conventions you had the meeting before the meeting.  So, therefore we couldn't go out at night because various delegations were getting together to see who was going put a person on the national board.  So, the southern region, some of the st- the states had to get together, Florida, Georgia and North Carolina.  They would make us sit up in those meetings at night, so then, we got to the real caucus meetings we knew who we were going be and how we, who we were going to vote.  That's how I learned politics.  That's how I know that a lot of decisions are made beforehand.  It's not when all the meetings are being held.  That's what Mr. Law made us do.  And so, that was an eye opener, and I knew that I was going to be involved in this kind of stuff 'cause I enjoyed all of that.  So, then you know, as I moved forward in high school, anything that kept me involved, because during that time the NAACP political advisory council came about.  And that's when Gene Gadsden and them came about.  And we organized and that's who we, we started interviewing candidates and telling people how to vote.  And during all of that, I was at the table when those things were happening.  So, where, you asked me a question and I lost my thought.
Speaker 1: Okay, no problem.  During this time, when you are working with the NAACP, you said that you all organized so that you could have the, the national youth task force?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: And you spent time, you know, in Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia demonstrating and conducting registration--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) drives, okay.
Speaker 2: Well let me tell you.
Story_ID: 657844
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) See what happened, when I graduated from high school [Alfred E. Beach High School, Savannah, Georgia] it was known that I was going to college [at Savannah State College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia].  Tuition was sixty-five dollars a quarter, and back then you didn't have financial aid and all that kind of stuff like our young people really don't realize.  And they should appreciate now.  So, my mom [Georgia Branch Dillard] would se- sent my sister's [Margie Reid Williams] and my tuition the first quarter, oh I went to school I didn't, you know, I was having me a good time too.  And, but we had, my grandmother [Jackson's maternal grandmother, Sadie Royal Branch] decided she would take in a couple of college students.  And my mother had sent the tuition for the second quarter, the winter quarter and my grandmamma went to get the money and there was no money.  One of the students had stolen the money for my tuition and my sister's tuition.  And they couldn't come up with tuition for me.  Didn't bother me, you know.  So, by that time Mr. Law [W.W. Law], they, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] had chosen some young people to work all over the South and I knew, they asked me, I dropped out.  And they sent me to North Carolina.  This guy Edwards [James Edwards, Jr.] in South Carolina worked--'cause I came up around, with all these guys.  Carolyn Quilloin [Carolyn Quilloin Coleman] stayed here in Georgia.  But, it was my responsibility to organize civil rights workers across that State of Florida.  The field director's office was right down the street from my mama's restaurant, Dillard's Restaurant [ph.].  We had arrived by then, my mother had re- remarried [to Mansfield Dillard] and she'd opened her restaurant.  So, my assignment was a city called Live Oak, Florida.  And we, my assignment was to go to meet with the ministers and all, remember now I was, I was just turned eighteen years old.  That's September, so this was January.  And there was another young man from Jacksonville [Florida], Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, not Bob Saunders [Robert W. Saunders, Sr.] was the field director.  Robert, Robert, I can't think of his name it will come.  But, he, we met in Live Oak, Florida to get people to teach them how to demonstrate.  And you had CORE and you also had the Congr- see, you had the Congress of Racial Equality, another one of the groups there.  But ours was teach them how to demonstrate.  Send them down there, and we had to set up for the attorneys to be ready to get them out of jail.  And the field director, the group out of Jacksonville was working with us and we were able to do that.  And I had to teach them non-violence.  Left there and went to Pahokee, Florida, to work there.  And we had to do several things, the same kinds of things, that's down in what they call the black muck.  But, you do the same thing, but it was my work in Tampa [Florida] where we were also demonstrating, when they decided that we were going to go to the March on Washington.  So, we had an integrated group of kids in the Youth Council [NAACP Youth Council] in Tampa.  So, my boss Bob Saunders said, "Edna [HistoryMaker Edna Jackson]," I said, "Mr. Saunders we want to go to March on Washington."  So, he said, "But you know how you gonna get there?"  So, we said, "Well y'all can get us some cars and we'll drive."  Well, long story short, we had three station wagons.  And that's the only time my sister ever participated in demonstrating.  Her thing was, "Well when you get yours I'll get mine."  By that time she had moved to Tampa, because she graduated.  Remember she was a senior, so she had graduated and she moved to Tampa to start, to become a teacher in Head Start down there.  So we went to the March on Washington with an integrated group of kids driving station wagons.  And here I was, eighteen years old, leading the group.  I couldn't drive, you know, I was eighteen, 'cause the insurance would not cover, so we had to have drivers--older people.  And a couple of years ago I was telling this story to someone else and we found the white couple, they were brother and sisters, David and David Bob, Boffet [ph.], and, I can't think of his sister and we found the brother and we later the found the, the bro- we found David. He's living in Colorado now.  But, the good part about it is that we integrated Florida.  And from there, Carolyn by that time was out of college and she was moving about.  And we worked, I worked all over Florida and we would come in and out of Georgia as well.  But, my assignment specifically at that time was Florida.
Story_ID: 657845
Speaker 1: You were actually living in Florida?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, I lived at my mother's [Georgia Branch Dillard] house.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, I was working all over the state.
Speaker 1: All right, so tell me about the March on Washington?  You take a group of people, how many people do you take and, how do you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I can't remember the exact numbers.  But, we went in three station wagons.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we knew of a resident where we were going to stay but remember we were gonna turn around, come drive on back to Tampa [Florida].  And we did, but we made as our, the base the Union Station [Washington, D.C.].  And I was skinny, real skinny then and I would be, we, we knew where we were gonna do, we marched, but we had to come back to that site.  And I'll never forget because I used to wear my hair pulled up, you know in a ponytail, with a bun or something like that attached to it.  And my eyes were always slanted, these ov- Oriental [East Asian] people came up to me and started talking to me as if I should be able to talk back to them.  My--one of my nicknames was Chink 'cause I had those slanted eyes.  That's why I wear eye makeup to make them look bigger now.  But, but it was wonderful to be able to say I participated in that march.  So, after left Florida NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] there are so much I'm leaving out of this story.  Because while we were there we were brought back to Savannah [Georgia].  Because Bobby Hill [Bobby L. Hill] who was a student at Savannah State [Savannah State College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia], became our boss.  And one of our workers Bernice Turner was arrested in Griffin, Georgia.  So, they brought all of us in and we all converge.  I'll never forget, and can I curse on this thing too?
Speaker 1: It's up to you.
Speaker 2: I'll never forget we were, so we moved into this, there was a funeral home there in Griffin, Georgia.  And that's where we had to stay.  And I'll never forget, Bobby walked up to the, the sheriff's office said, "Attorney Bobby Hill, NAACP."  Man said, "I don't give a damn who you are, you get out of my jail."  But, anyways long story short we got Bernice out of jail (laughter).  And, and you know life, I, you, back then we did things you know, because it was the right thing to do.

Speaker 1: But, it was a group of us, James Brown [James Brown, Jr.], who was in the class of '59 [1959] at Beach [Alfred E. Beach High School, Savannah, Georgia], but he was a student at Savannah State [Savannah State College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia].  He was in the Youth Council [NAACP Youth Council] he went on to become the national youth director for NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  He's now deceased.  Carolyn [Carolyn Quilloin Coleman] is still on the board of directors.  She was here, we had the unveiling of the first place where students were arrested here in Savannah [Georgia].  And that was a project that was a project that I was determined to have, under my administration as mayor of this city.  And we were able to pull it off through the Georgia Historical Society.  Carolyn and Joan [Joan Tyson Hall] are the only two that are living now.  Carolyn serves on the county commission in Greensboro [North Carolina].  She was the highest ranking--she went on to become the highest ranking African American in governor, Governor Hunt's [Jim Hunt] administration in North Carolina.  Let me tell you about this, and I will, I hate to, I hate to deviate and you--Carolyn is still in the field.  She fought very hard to get this new governor [Roy Cooper] elected.  And her assistant is now his assistant.  Carolyn, you know, in North Carolina you have Moral Monday, she was arrested and someone called told me say Room, we called each other Room when we lived in Birmingham [Alabama].  She said, I, she said, "Your Room was arrested."  And I called and I said, "Room, you were arrested?"  She said, "Yeah," I said, "Did you carry your leg?"  'Cause she lost a leg, you know, through diabetes and all of that.  And she laughed and she said, "No, girl, I didn't carry my leg."  But, let's get back.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay (laughter).
Story_ID: 657847
Speaker 1: Now we're--that was '63 [1963], '64 [1964], you know and then you say--
Speaker 2: I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you went to Griffin--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Georgia and work with that.  Okay so, 1965--now remember Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy], what's your thoughts about, you know, Kennedy becomes president.  When was the first time that you were able to vote?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: The first time you voted?
Speaker 2: And I voted when I turned eighteen, which was September of 1962.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I went to Kennedy's inauguration, I have pictures.  I was--and Mercedes [Mercedes Wright Arnold] and I were at that inauguration.
Speaker 1: Okay and what was, you want to talk about that?  Because how did you feel after he was elected and then his assassination?
Speaker 2: Sad, sad, very sad because, but see people don't realize Kennedy was assass- assassinated, but you also have to realized that [President] Lyndon Baines Johnson carried out the wishes of his administration.  And people don't talk about that.  It was through him that the March on Washington--you know, people don't know who the players were for the March on Washington.  We know, 'cause we had to learn it.  People don't talk about Rus- Rustin [Bayard Rustin], people don't talk about A. Philip Randolph.  People don't talk about [HistoryMaker] Dorothy Height, the only woman that was in the room.  People don't talk about those things, those were people that I rubbed shoulders with.  Whitney Young, people don't talk about them, people don't talk about the N- the role that NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] played in the March on Washington.  You know and it, it, it hurts sometime because those are some of the unsung heroes.  When people talk about King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] because the march was being planned, you know, during that time.  But, it was the I Have a Dream that brought King forth in those days.  But, Roy Wilkins.  I think about the role that Roy Wilkins played.  And all of them getting that march pulled together.  But, you don't hear about it.  Our young people don't know about it.
Story_ID: 657848
Speaker 1: So, after, after King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and the March on Washington and, and Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy], there's another march, okay.  And [HistoryMaker] John Lewis and (clears throat) all of them are involved in this as well.
Speaker 2: Oh that, that was not until after I went back to co- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was '65 [1965]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, no let me tell, long--there was a long part before then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mrs. Ruby Hurley who was the state field director for NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  And our boss along with, god, I just saw his book up there, Mr. Law [W.W. Law] was so dynamite, it will come to me.  She was our play mother.  I have a picture of her on the postage, U.S. postage stamp.  Ruby Hurley, she was like a play mother.  When the NAACP won the lawsuit to move back into the State of Alabama, we had to pack up and go Alabama.  Carolyn [Carolyn Quilloin Coleman] had graduated, so we got into her car and we drove from Savannah, Georgia to Birmingham, Alabama.  The role, our role then wa- you know, Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] used to be state field director for NAACP in Georgia.  Lord I could tell you a lot of stories (laughter).  Ruby Hurley--we st- our office was in the Masonic Hall in Birmingham.  Remember now we were young, Carolyn had a degree, I had not gone back to college [Savannah State College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia].  And our job was to organize Youth Councils [NAACP Youth Council] and college charters throughout the State of Alabama.  We had to meet people--there were some people, what people don't realize is that the leaders of the Montgomery [Alabama] movement were really people that were in the NAACP.  When they put NAACP out of the State of Alabama, so, when we went into Alabama we had to, to organize the Youth Coun- the college charters at Miles [Miles College, Fairfield, Alabama], at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], at Alabama State [Alabama State College; Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama] and all of that.  That's what our role, Carolyn and my role, that was our role.  I get my was and weres mixed up (laughter) sometimes.  And there was a professor at, at Tuskegee, Dr. C.G. Gomillion [Charles G. Gomillion].  And he was my contact and I had to go and talk with him.  Carolyn went one way I went another way.  And that's who we had to talk with to get to the Montgomery to talk to--you know, to find the contacts, for us to organize.  That was all that we did.  But, also during that time because integration was taking place we were getting ready to go to Denver, Colorado for the NAACP national convention.  We had to organize the bus to go for that Carolyn, here was Carolyn and I.  And ride the bus.
Story_ID: 657849
Speaker 1: What year was that, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: That was in 19--had to be '63 [1963], sixty--August '64 [1964], 1964.  March on Washington was '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: Three [1963].
Speaker 2: So, it had to have been '64 [1964].  So, by that time so we, we came back and we organized, after the Civil Rights Act [Civil Rights Act of 1964] was passed, we, we had to organize a mini convention in Birmingham [Alabama].  And we were, are on the National Youth Work Committee.  We had to set up the, the national conventions because that was Ruby Hurley's responsibility, that's we had to learn how to set up a dais.  You know, that's why I tell you, look here, I learned from a lot of good people, good people.  So then one day we were in, in Birmingham and my boss called me and he said, "Edna [HistoryMaker Edna Jackson], when are you going back to school?"  And I said, "When I get my freedom."  And he said to me, "What are going to do with it once you get it?"  And I'd never thought like that, because I believed so much in what we were doing.  Education was not there.  You know I figured I could come back and do all that later.  You know, I had to continue to fight.  You know, here we were, here we were, you know, we were going, we were, we were going to drive over to Birmingham, I mean to Jackson, Mississippi.  And they killed the minister that day on Lynch Street [John R. Lynch Street] in Jackson.  And we had fly in, the night riders followed us in from the airport.  We didn't even have a pencil on--you couldn't carry anything--as civil rights workers you couldn't carry anything at that time.  And here I am, my boss asked me a very profound question.  He said, "I'll give you a deal," I said, "Okay."  "We gonna send you back to school, we'll keep you on payroll," twenty-five dollars a week, "We'll keep you on payroll and you can continue civil rights work on weekends."  That's how I got back to Savannah State College [Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia].
Speaker 1: So, what year did you go back to?
Speaker 2: I went back to Savannah State in 19--it must have been 1964.
Speaker 1: So, it was before the Selma march [Selma to Montgomery March]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I was a student and my boss--I mean I was a student and I worked for some wonderful people.  I got a little job out there too.  And I wanted to go to the march and I had this professor Dr. Williams [ph.], who taught government.  So, he knew me, everybody knew what I did and all that kind of stuff.  So, I said, "Dr. Williams, I wanna go to be a part of the march from Selma [Alabama] to Montgomery [Alabama]."  And he said, "Okay," I said, "I can't come to your class if I go you know, to do all of this, you know."  So, he said, "Well we'll do--we'll build everything around it, you go and you talk to the vice president.  And then you can go--it's okay with me.  You need to break, take it to your other instructors," fine with all of them.  So, NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] flew me in in order for me to participate in that march from Selma to Montgomery.  The march had gotten underway now.  We were not at the bridge [Edmund Pettus Bridge, Selma, Alabama].  But, if you recall in history, it tells you how others, you know, joined the march.  And we joined the march and we marched right on in to Ge- to Montgomery.  And I used to have a picture and I don't know what happened, that said I was there.  When my house burned of course we lost quite a bit of stuff.
Story_ID: 657850
Speaker 1: So, you continue working with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  You go to Savannah State [Savannah State College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia] and, what year do you graduate?
Speaker 2: I finished Savannah State in between marriage, having a baby and all of that, in 1968.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's when you, okay.  And--
Speaker 2: I fell in love.
Speaker 1: You fell in love, so tell me about you falling in love?
Speaker 2: It didn't last (laughter).  What happened--my girlfriend, one of my friends who was ahead of me, well we finished high school together [at Alfred E. Beach High School, Savannah, Georgia] but you know, when I came back it was, they didn't finish--that class came out in '66 [1966], but we were real close friends.  And she said one day, she said, "Edna [HistoryMaker Edna Jackson], that guy over there watching you."  I looked, I say, "Oh okay."  I said, "Girl let me go over here and get ready, I need to go home."  And so, at the bus stop he said, "I'll take you home."  I said, "My grandma [Jackson's maternal grandmother, Sadie Royal Branch] said I can't ride, I can't ride, I can't ride in somebody's car."  You know, how parents were back in the day, you had to take the bus.  So, my girlfriend Thelma [ph.] said, "Girl I'll ride with you. I'll ride with you," (laughter).  And we rode and he would--every day, he was follow me, follow me.  So, we started dating.  And then it became, I became pregnant.  And we got married and I didn't want to be married.  But, it was a choice that I made and my family wanted that.  And we stayed married two and half years.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: George Jackson.
Speaker 1: And you got pregnant and had a--?
Speaker 2: Son, Kevan Lamar Jackson, Kevan K-E-V-A-N [Kevan Jackson].
Story_ID: 657851
Speaker 1: So when you graduate, and, and what year was this is, was this in '68 [1968] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went back--after I had my son [Kevan Jackson], I went back to school.  He was born in '66 [1966].  And so I went back to school to finish up and I will tell anybody my son has the most wonderful father [Jackson's ex-husband, George Jackson] in the world.  He was not marr- ready for marriage and I was not ready for marriage.  He was spoiled and God knows I was spoiled.  I had decided, because I changed my major, what I wanted out of life and you know, I had to go back to school, in order to accomplish what I wanted to do.  And went back to school, we stayed married but you know, it was, you know, we, we just weren't, we, we ne- we were just not made for each.  (Unclear) we talk and we talk about all that now.
Speaker 1: What type of degree did you get from Savannah State [Savannah State College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: I received by B.S. degree in sociology.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  What happened next did you go back to school once again?
Speaker 2: I went to school, well when I, while I was in at Savannah State, I, I got a little job, part time job student worker making fifty cents an hour.  And you didn't get paid until the end of the semester.  But, I worked for, again, people who saw something in me.  I worked for a man by the name of Wilton Scott, who was--he was born before his time, he over public relations and it was during that time that I learned to do a whole lot of things.  To organize, he was over all of the homecoming, all of this and all of that.  And (unclear) and here I was, ended NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] had taught me so much, so I carried skills there.  And then I started from Prince Jackson [HistoryMaker Prince Jackson, Jr.].  Prince Jackson was over the math department and I was taking stats from him.  And I would fool him, every time he would give an example I said, "Doc, you know, you got all that work in the office.  So, I need to go and do this and all that," but it didn't, it didn't faze him.  But, lo and behold I worked with them.  When I finished Savannah State because of my work in the community I had a job waiting for me at the Sav- at the Economic Opportunity Authority, EOA, Savannah Economic, well I get all these thing, EOA Savannah Economic, oh god, Authority [Economic Opportunity Authority for Savannah-Chatham County Area, Inc., Savannah, Georgia].  Okay, you see, it's--anyway, it was the anti-poverty program.  They're still very popular now.  So, I graduated in August of '68 [1968].  And two weeks later I was on my job.  And I became the social worker, but I was still fighting for the rights.  And it was the rights of not just African Americans, anybody.  When I became the social worker there was, I had this lady that was, that trained me.  There were--and she you know, she carried me around to introduce me to people.  She was a white social worker, carried me to this lady's house, and she was--introduced me to the lady.  The lady didn't want me helping her.
Story_ID: 657852
Speaker 1: So okay so you're now a social worker for EOA [Economic Opportunity Authority for Savannah-Chatham County Area, Inc., Savannah, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so how long do you work there?
Speaker 2: I worked for--at EOA from August 1968 until April of '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: Okay and what were some of the things that you did as a social worker for EOA?
Speaker 2: My thing was to really, to help people to get on public assistance.  And to help them to get medical assistance, particularly through the hospital here that was for indigent care.  And one of my, one of my cases I'm so proud of there was this lady that nobody wanted to help.  And they locked us up in the hospital, but that was okay.  Because, they, the doctor didn't want to--it was this, it was an older white woman.  And because she had this foul odor, the doctor and nurses in emergency room didn't want to see her.  And they were making fun at her.  Of course it was not funny to me.  And of course they had to see her, 'cause I called one of the members of the board to let them know what was happening.  And they locked me and one of my coworkers up in, in one of the rooms out there.  Oh yeah, oh yeah, 'cause I was still in the mode, remember know, I sti- I was still that fighter. That fight was not out of me.  And if that lady--she was a human being just like everybody else and they had to serve her.  So, he lost--the man that was in the, the doctor that was in the, in the emergency room, he was fired.  And the nurse lost her job as well.  And that was because there was a, we had a black member on the board at the time.  And we called him and he reported it back to the board and the peo- I mean they didn't want to touch this lady, that's what gloves are for.  And the lady was so thankful, that we were able to do that for her.  I saw no color, I saw--and that is what the Civil Rights Movement did for me.  You know, you couldn't see color if you were going to be in the Civil Rights Movement.  Because the Civil Rights Movement was not just about black folks, particularly here in this city.  You know, you had the Jewish community that played a very vital role here in our community.  Okay.
Story_ID: 657853
Speaker 1: Okay, so in 1971, what, what happens next, okay?
Speaker 2: In 1971, my old boss Dr. Prince Jackson, Jr. [HistoryMaker Prince Jackson, Jr.] who became the president at that time of Savannah State [Savannah State College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia] called me at the EOA [Economic Opportunity Authority for Savannah-Chatham County Area, Inc., Savannah, Georgia] and said, "Edna [HistoryMaker Edna Jackson], I got a job for you."  I said, "Okay," I said, "well doc, you know I like working with people."  He said, "Oh you get a lot of (unclear) working with a lot of people."  So, I said, "Okay." He said, "How much money you make at EOA?"  I said, "I make $5500."  Of course back in the day that was--social work, I was making $5500, you know I, I had my own house, I had gotten a divorce [from George Jackson].  I had done all those kinds of things.  So, my son [Kevan Jackson] and I were making it.  He said, "I'll pay you twelve thousand dollars."  I said, "I'm coming."  So, the program was the Emergency School Assistance Program.  And back then in--and during time they were about to, to bus, start busing here in the City of Savannah [Georgia].  And my job was to go in and to organize young people because they were fighting each other.  And I was able to go into all of the high schools the black and the white ones and to organize advisory boards in order to get the white kids and the black kids talking to each other.  We had one of the most successful programs in the country.  I had to carry my kids to conferences so they could talk about it.  We went, 'cause our program was so successful.  And that was my first official job at Savannah State.
Speaker 1: So, while you're at Savannah State, so how, how long are you there at Sa- Savannah State?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was there for thirty years and never applied for any jobs.  Never, never applied, and the jobs always sought me.  Because my, my work has always been my signature.  Now I didn't--while I'm at Savannah State I'm still running political campaigns out the community too, with Gene Gadsden [Eugene Gadsden].  And so, after the, the program folded I started, I ran a consumer service program for Armstrong Savannah State [Armstrong State College; Georgia Southern University-Armstrong Campus, Savannah, Georgia].  Then I became a part of the counseling center and it was there that--I was not trained as a counselor.  And Hinton Thomas, who was my boss, said, "Edna, I want you to go back to school."  And--no, it wasn't then, during the time I was at E- running the Emergency School Assistance Program, Hinton encouraged me to go back to school to work on my master's [degree].  He said, "If you're gonna work on a college campus you need your master's."  So, that's when I went back to school and got my master's in political science education.
Story_ID: 657854
Speaker 1: Where did you go to school?
Speaker 2: It started out at Savannah State [Savannah State College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia].  And they were merging two programs together.  So my degree read Savannah State-Armstrong State.  So, I received my master's in political science education.
Speaker 1: Armstrong State College [Georgia Southern University-Armstrong Campus, Savannah, Georgia], there was, there's history there in Savannah [Georgia] also with [HistoryMaker] Otis Johnson who you talked about earlier.  Do you have a memory of what happened during that time?
Speaker 2: Oh every, every, every, yes.  To answer your question, let me tell you what happened.  It was during that time when Otis had gone into the [U.S.] military and had come out.  He came out and went to Savannah State.  See Otis went into the military in June I think of '60 [1960].  And then when he came back home he was at Savannah State.  Well, we had demonstrations going on, on the campus I was off doing some civil rights work.  But, they were boycotting Savannah State because they fired a professor [Cleveland Christophe, Sr.].  Well, Mr. Law [W.W. Law], Mercedes Wright [Mercedes Wright Arnold] and Gene [Eugene Gadsden] needed students to go to integrate Armstrong; that was a junior college.  So a lot of them said they were gonna go over there.  Well, Otis ended up being the only one.  When you looked around Otis was the only one.  And back in the day they had to get somebody to approve Otis to go, he filled out paperwork and everything.  But, you needed an alum, so they were, they were able to find a alumnus Dr. Robinson, I think it was Mason Robinson [ph.] that did the letter for Otis to get into Armstrong Atlantic.  And he got it--Armstrong junior college.  Well, now you need to go back to understand why there is an Armstrong now.  You see back in the '60s [1960s] after Brown versus the Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], the white community did not want white students going to Savannah State that was founded in 1890.  So, they, they took Atlantic, the junior college that was private, and they made it into a state institution and put it out to where it is now.  And then it made, Otis when Otis was there it was still a junior college.  But as things started progressing and they wanted to integrate and integrate, they made Armstrong a four year institution.  By that time Otis had gone to the University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia] to become the first African American from Savannah [Georgia] to graduate from there.  You know, he was right after Charlayne Hunter [HistoryMaker Charlayne Hunter-Gault] and Hamilton Holmes.  How I know all of this 'cause you know I was still in the midst of things.  Still doing civil rights work, still going to school and still running campaigns, okay.
Story_ID: 657855
Speaker 1: We were talking about I went to school, got my master's [degree].  And then, after our program phased out, the desegre- the Emergency School Assistance Program, I--they asked me if I would work--run a consumer service program.  I did that.  Then they asked me to, I'd been working with students in counseling, if I would work in counseling.  I went over there and I worked in counseling.  And that's when Hinton Thomas said, "Edna [HistoryMaker Edna Jackson], I want to send you to summer school, to get some hours in counseling."  I was trained by Hinton Thomas, [HistoryMaker] Shirley James and Yvonne Stevens [ph.].  I could give every standardized test that was offered.  I could counsel the kids.  It was just a natural thing for me.  So, I went to school and took courses down at Georgia Southern [Georgia Southern College; Georgia Southern University, Statesboro, Georgia], didn't lose any time doing it, 'cause we did it during the summer.  Another one of my friends and I went.  After that I was asked to, to work in--where did I go from there?  They needed an omnibusman [sic. ombudsman].  Oh, I also during this time became vice president of the national alumni association.  And so then they asked me if I would work as director of alumni affairs.  'Cause the other one was moving up.  So, I became the director of alumni affairs.  So, then they asked me--and I built the alumni association to include fifteen thousand--a database of fifteen thousand, and that was unheard of.  But, I organized chapters and they were very good, 'cause Prince Jackson [HistoryMaker Prince Jackson, Jr.] had been in that role.  Remember he's the president.  So, we organized chapters all over everywhere.  So, then I left from there, that--while I was the alumni director, Savannah State [Savannah State College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia] had a program called the Elderhostel.  The Elderhostel program was a senior citi- program for senior citizens.  And people would come from all other the world to take courses.  And they would spend a week on the camp- at the college.  And the program was falling apart.  So, they asked me if I would do that and of course that was more money for me.  And I said yes.  And I ran the Elderhostel program until I left Savannah State.  In between I be- I started working, when I was the alumni association president, one of the presidents that time he said he needed some help in financial aid.  So, I went to financial aid.  And I helped to develop programs over there too.  And then I worked in--oh god these years are all mixed up.  Because I also worked as a recruiter and I worked in admissions so when you look at if you look at that book, you know, that I shared with you, you will see all of those things in, in the book.  Where I worked all over the campus and never applied for the job.  Never.  What they found out, during a SACS [Southern Association of Colleges and Schools] evaluation and they were pulling all of the personnel files together, the vice president of academic affairs called me in one day and said, "Edna [HistoryMaker Edna Jackson], yeah, where's your application for employment at Savannah State?"  I said, "It's down there in personnel."  They didn't have--I never applied.  But, I did my thirty years there.  Best years of my life.
Story_ID: 657856
Speaker 1: Wow, that was a, a lot (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So, outside of working--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --full time you still now, you, you need to explain how you were able to be on these different boards and to get into politics?
Speaker 2: Well, I served as the chairman of Chatham County Hospital Authority and it was under my administration that they financed the biggest bond for the growth of Memorial Medical Center [Memorial Health University Medical Center, Savannah, Georgia].  My name is on all of those documents.  But, we had to have a little fight there too.  Because in doing the bonding back then, the, the hospital director at that time wanted to decide who, who were, you know, going to do the bonding.  So, I said, "Oh no we not gonna do it that way."  He said, "What?"  I said, "What, what companies--what security companies are you using?"  And he said--I said, "What minority comp- companies are you using?"  So, he was using the companies out of New York [New York].  I said, "No we gonna do it a new way."  So, I said, "I want you to put it out to bid.  And I want you to send them out to minority security company--." Well, it was only one in the day.  And that was Maynard Jackson.  And what ha- what ha- what happened, Maynard's name came in with every major bonding company, that applied for that.  For--you know, to do the bonds.  So, no matter who won, at the, at the level, the top level, he was going to be in that.  And I'll never forget when they brought me the report they had him at the lot--bottom tier.  And I'd already talked to my board members, said, "It's not fair."  So, I told them, I said, "No, we are going to send a message.  Maynard should come in at the second tier because he came in with all these bonding agencies."  He just needed the, you know, the money and all of that kind of stuff.  So, we were able to move him up.  Well, of course I wasn't reappointed to the hospital authority (laughter) after my term ran out.  But, that's all right, because if you can't serve your time while you are there effecting change, you don't need to be on that board.  Because your just becoming a yes person or a just--a seat, taking a seat.  And I've never been one that was just going to sit in a seat.
Story_ID: 657857
Speaker 1: Okay, and then there's the Democratic executive committee?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, vice president of Chatham County [Georgia] Democratic executive committee, which is nothing but the Chatham County Democratic Party.  I served as, they had it here so you had to have two African American vice presidents and two white vice presidents, irregardless of who the president was.  And you had to have fe- two females, so I fit both of them.  And then my thing was during this time I was good at making sample ballots 'cause Gene Gadsden [Eugene Gadsden] had taught me how to do that.  You know I could, I ran Zell Miller's campaign, you know.  When he was, you know, out there.  We did Jimmy Carter's [James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] campaign.  We did Clinton's [William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] camp- every president.  Because we, because we had the political advisory council.  We would run campaigns for all of the gubernatorial camp- Roy Barnes, when, when, when, oh what's his name?  I called him the big guy, he ran, I ran, I did his campaign.  I have run so many campaigns it is unreal because Gene later turned everything over to me because he was going to become the judge, the first African American judge [on the Chatham County Superior Court], but he had taught me how to do it all.  And I was good at what I did now.  That was my forte.
Story_ID: 657858
Speaker 1: So, what made you decide to step into politics to run for office?
Speaker 2: For a run?  I didn't (laughter).  Floyd Adams [Floyd Adams, Jr.] had decided that he was going to run for mayor [of Savannah, Georgia].  And he asked me to run for the at large seat.  Well, this was a first time that an African American was going to be running for mayor.  So, I, my role was to help get him in.  I didn't care about me getting in there.  So, you know, I was busy helping him get in and I lost my runoff--I mean I lost my election.  That was fine with me because we were able to get Floyd in.  So, the second time around Floyd said, "Edna [HistoryMaker Edna Jackson]," he and Gwen Goodman [Gwendolyn Goodman], he said "It's your turn this time."  The guy that beat me, I mean the first time, he was there, so he said, "Now we want you to run this time."  "All right," I said, "okay, Floyd."  This was Floyd terms--term, second term running.  He said, "I'm gonna be all right."  I said, "Okay."  So, I ran again, five candidates, I won.  Got into the runoff, lady that was a very dear friend of mine was in the runoff and she got upset with me.  She didn't speak to me--with me for a lot of years.  But, I won and even the, the, the sitting member endorsed me; he was a Republican.  He said, "Edna," he said, "you have been such a nice person, you are not a nasty campaigner or anything. I wanna help you to win."  And I did.  And then I was fine and Otis [HistoryMaker Otis Johnson] wanted me to be his pro tem.  When he ran, I helped him in.  I was still running as you know, pro--as the mayor, and the council selected me to be pro tem.
Speaker 1: And that's for which?
Speaker 2: For Otis' term (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) For Otis' term, okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Both of his terms.  And when Otis--the second term Otis had a heart attack.  And I--my counsel came to me in tears, he was in Memphis [Tennessee].  Said, "Edna," and I had talked to his brother and everything, I said, "Do I need to come?"  He said, "No, Otis just wants you to run the city."  I said, "Okay."  My counsel said, "Edna we don't care how much it costs, you go, you look him in the face, you see for yourself."  I got on the plane and the next thing I knew I was standing up over Otis saying, "Hey," (laughter).  And he said, "What you doing here?"  But, that was ki- the kind of working relationship that our council had.  We bounced things off.  We didn't always get along, now, but, if it was for the good of the community we did it.  And so, Otis said, "It's your turn."  You know and so that's how I got to run for mayor.  And I won.  And I did a wonderful term.  But, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Before go forward, now, some of these other positions that you had, I wanted to know whether they are, or they were, at the same time that you were alderman or on the council.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And because they, they're pretty important and it, it says a member, former member of the U.S. selective board.  And, appointed by Congressman John Barrow to serve a member of the Military Academy selection committee [for the United States Military Academy, West Point, New York].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And the regional committee of the U.S. civil rights commission [U.S. Commission on Civil Rights].  So, those are, you know, pretty (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I ran--
Speaker 1: --important things, so.
Speaker 2: I ran John's campaign for, I carried nine counties for him.  I was working at Savannah State [Savannah State College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia] but I was also on city council [Savannah City Council].  And he, we still keep in touch.  That's, but that's my thing, winning.
Speaker 1: Okay. So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, but to answer your question, yes I was, I was working.  I had not retired.  I retired from Savannah State in 2001 and that's when I went on city council.  So, the John Barrow piece and all of those appointments was after I became an elected official.
Speaker 1: Okay, fantastic.
Story_ID: 657859
Speaker 1: Now in the, the, in Otis', [HistoryMaker] Otis Johnson's last term--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and in, one of things for his first and second that he instituted was the, the community--
Speaker 2: Town hall meetings.
Speaker 1: Town hall meetings.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, as mayor pro tem, and, did you continue those as well?
Speaker 2: During his tenure.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yes, but it was the biggest mistake that I ever made was to not to continue the town hall meetings on a regular basis.  Because I was being pulled in so many directions.  My, my, my way of, of being the mayor of Savannah [Georgia] was to be a, hands on person.  And I did too much of being the hands on person and I would go to every meeting.  Every neighborhood association meeting and all those things but I did not continue the, the town hall meetings.  I had many meetings but he had a set schedule of town hall meetings and that was a flaw in my administration.
Story_ID: 657860
Speaker 1: Well, that might have been a flaw but people obviously loved you, they voted for you.  So, what are you most proud of and--when were elected mayor [of Savannah, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: I am--during the time when I weren't in--went in as mayor, our council [Savannah City Council] was in disarray because we'd gone through a search.  And it divided the council.  Because we selected an African American female and--
Speaker 1: A search for?
Speaker 2: For a city manager and this young lady [Rochelle Small Toney] had served the interim.  And the council at that time wanted this white candidate.  And it really divided us.  The newspapers started a job on Otis [HistoryMaker Otis Johnson], you know and his administration.  And calling him a racist, and doing all of that, which wasn't true, because he was qu-misquoted.  And we had some council members that were just (gesture), "You," and I mean they were just dogmatic with him and all of that, and they pushed.  And Otis, Otis had done so many valuable things.  But, it got lost in the shuffle.
Speaker 1: So, when you were mayor this city council person that was already appointed was, was she--you said that she was African American?
Speaker 2: African American female.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what happened in you term, did she stay there?
Speaker 2: I got rid of, I didn't get rid of her.  I asked for her resignation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so that means you had to do another search?
Speaker 2: We had to do another--but we didn't do a search.
Speaker 1: You didn't, okay?
Speaker 2: No.  We had, first thing we had to do was, because we had new members coming on council, and we had to bring our council together, which was most important.  I didn't want a five-four council.  I wanted a council that I can say, "We voted unanimously."  Or, we voted eight-one, or seven-two.  Anything else I didn't, I didn't want that.  We were working in the interest of the people and my thing is we can talk about it from here to kingdom's come.  As long as, we came out of those meeting together.  And 90 percent of the time under my administration I can say, we came out that together.  We had those votes.  And that's why we were--and we came through a lot, under my, my administration.  Because, we found out we had, we appointed a young lady, no, no, we didn't appoint her then.  Our, I don't want to discuss why the young lady was asked to leave because when I, when I asked her for her resignation, she didn't do it.  And of course after a while, and I saw things still going downhill, you know.  I knew that we had to change.  So, this council supported me on removing her.  And we did.  But, we appointed a young lady that was an assistant city manager, (cough) excuse me, Stephanie Cutter.  There were people in the community that wanted me to start a search right away.  And I said no.  You see, you have to realize in our community, there are not, there are some people who are not accustomed to being told no.  But, when I said no, I told you why I was not going to say, do, what you were asking me to do.  So, we appointed her an interim.  And they wanted, they kept after me.  I said, "We are still pulling this council together.  We are working well."  And it worked.  So, when it came time, nine months and--six months into her appointment, she was doing such a fabulous job.  It was under her administration that we found out we had corrupt police force.  We had to get rid of the police--corrupt police force.  The--she fired the police chief [Willie Lovett].  It wasn't for what the feds had found out. It was because of something else.  But after the, fe- the feds came and told us what was going on.  We had to think again.
Story_ID: 657861
Speaker 1: When we put Stephanie [Stephanie Cutter] in the position, we worked together as a team.  She became part of that team.  When we found out about the corruption that was in the police department [Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police Department], she immediately got rid of ever- you know, the chief [Willie Lovett].  We had to have an interim chief.  She appointed a female interim chief [Julie Tolbert].  And she worked very well with us.  But, during that interim, during that period we also we experienced a lot of shootings here, here in Savannah [Georgia].  Most of them were black on black shootings.  And then it was also during that time when--no, when, when, when we were working with her, as we were transitioning, the police chief went to jail.  And we had the interim chief.  We knew had to eventually get another chief, okay.  So, when I went to the council [Savannah City Council] I said, "Is it time to extend either Stephanie's stay, or tell me what you want."  Every last one of them except one said, "Edna [HistoryMaker Edna Jackson], you know we don't want a search.  Stephanie has been doing and working well with us.  We want her to be the city manager on a permanent basis."  Everybody said that to me.  I went to them individually and some of them I even said--asked why.  And then some of them came to me, "Let's go to breakfast."  'Cause you know, I knew the one young man came to me, he said, "Now okay," you have to understand his name is Tony Thomas.  Tony and I built a relationship, Tony said, "Edna, now I got a lot of things to address to you about my district."  He said, "And then I want to talk about Stephanie.  We need to make Stephanie the city manager."  I'm counting my fingers 'cause I knew--went to another one, Mary Ellen Sprague, said, "Edna, I love Stephanie we need to make her permanent," two, two Republicans, okay.  Even though it's a non-partisan election.  Went to Mary, Mary said, "Oh, you know, we got to make--," I can't say it in the language that she said, make Stephanie the thing.  Then I went to John Hall, no John Hall wasn't in that group.  I went to a couple--yes John Hall was in that group.  He said, "I'm ready to make Stephanie--." He said, "We don't need to have no search, that's what tore up the council before."  Tom Bordeaux told me came on the council 'cause he wanted to do a search, for a city manager.  I went to him I said, "Tom," I said, you know, "we gotta do something about Stephanie."  He said, "I want to talk to you about it." Said, "You know why I wanted to come on."  I said, "Yeah," he said, "I like Stephanie, we need to make her permanent."  I had all my votes, except one.  The one person I knew that would not have voted, but she had no other choice, I didn't even waste my time to talk to her.  But, she voted for it.  She eventually voted for Stephanie.  So, here we are with Stephanie.  Stephanie had gotten rid of everybody you know, we were on our way.  And lo and behold, the crime rates--we were experiencing all of these shooting.
Story_ID: 657862
Speaker 1: Then we had a white officer [David Jannot] to shoot a young man [Charles Smith].  It was on my birthday, two years ago, September 18th. (Background noise) I'm getting ready, we, oh.  I'm getting ready to you know, to have city council meeting [of the Savannah City Council].  We get a call in our pre council meeting, "Edna, there has been a shooting in West Savannah [Savannah, Georgia], and a young man's life has been taken."  So, West Savannah was Van Johnson's area.  So, I said, "Van [Van R. Johnson II] go out there and call me right back."  He went out there to look out, he was an alderman.  He said, "It's bad."  So, I said, "Okay, I said, "you come back and I'm on my way."  Stephanie Cutter, the chief of police [Julie Tolbert] and I went out there, three females.  You never heard anything about it.  When I got out there along with Stephanie and the chief, I wouldn't--I didn't want any policemen around me.  I didn't even want to go, want to stand under the railing.  I talked to my people.  Someone said to me, he said, "Miss," he said, "mayor, you don't need to go out there."  I said, "Why not?" I said, "These are my people.  This is in the African American neighborhood.  If, I can come out of here and ask them to vote for me, then I can stand out here and talk to them."  And they listened to me.  They did night marches.  The, the, the Black Panther Party came in here.  Pastor Brown [HistoryMaker Reverend Matthew Southall Brown, Sr.] and I went out there.  I don't know if he mentioned it.  We've, we were in a meeting, I said, "Pastor Brown I need you."  We went out there to sit down to eat some chicken wings and I was ju- we felt, we made a conversation like we didn't know we were doing, who that young man was and he told us.  And I said, "Oh I'm [HistoryMaker] Edna Jackson the mayor of Savannah [Georgia], thank you for coming."  I said, "And this is Pastor Brown," and we went on and on and we talked.  And I said, "Let me tell you everything that has happened and where we're going with this."  He said, "Well, we got them coming in from Waynesboro [Georgia]."  I said, "Waynesboro."  He said, "Yeah, that's my hometown."  I said, "Oh my people from Wayne. Do you know So and So and So?  My cousin is on the police force," so you know, just to open up the thing.  Well, long story short they came in here, that night they had, they were having marches.  They weren't, but they wanted to see how they were gonna march.  This young man and--decided that he, he used to be a member of the Panther Party in Savannah.  And he went down and he used the bullhorn to talk about a man where the grocery store was.  This man was Ori- Indian, Indian.  "Y'all need to run him out of the thing.  Y'all need to do this," I said, "Oh hell no."  I was up, back up by the other area.  I walked out in the middle of street and when I down they said, "Oh there go the mayor."  So, when I was g- halfway, almost halfway, all of a sudden I saw the Panthers do their little turn.  And you know how they (gesture) do their thing like that, you know.  So, I said to the young man, I said, "Oh, is the, you know, the protest over?"  He said, "Mayor we're satisfied you have this in order.  We don't act like that.  We're leaving your city."  No one ever knew that they came through here to be a part of all the disruptions.  When they the dec- the people in the neighborhood decided that they were gonna march that, you know, every day, we say, "Okay, just tell me, give me your schedule.  We'll make sure that you are protected by the police."  They marched--first march they had they had these little kids at the beginning of the line.  I pulled the leaders aside I said, "Now let me tell y'all about the art of marching.  You never put the babies in the front."  "Oh," I said, "So now, if y'all are--." I said, "First thing, y'all need to have them in the march.  But, if you make sure you protect them by putting them in the back you have a right to march.  But, now the minute y'all throw something through somebody's stuff I'm going to put you in jail."  You never heard about it.  Savannah State [Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia] students laid out on the highway 80 [U.S. Route 80].  I was way up in North Georgia and they called me.  I was at Georgia Municipal Association meeting.  I got in my car, Lonnie [Alonzo Adams, Jr.] was with me.  Got in my car and I said, "Tell them I'll meet them at twelve o'clock."  Met them and I explained what my life was like.  They never did it again.  I said, "A fellow student was killed right out there on that street, for collecting scholarship money."  I said, "So you need to know why you going, who's gonna get you out of jail?  Y'all haven't done any of that."  So, that was if you ask me of something that I was proud of, I was proud of that moment.  When CNN came in here and said, "How did y'all do it? You are three women."  We said, "That's how we did it.  We're three women that can feel the pulse of the people.  That can work with people.  That are--," we do not antagonize people but they know w- they knew we were coming from.  And they--so we worked together, that is what happened.  It was all over the press.  But, most of the time, it wasn't a covered story.  Because we didn't have the outbreaks like they had out there, you know, in other areas.
Story_ID: 657863
Speaker 1: Let me tell you what happened.  You know I enjoyed being mayor [of Savannah, Georgia].  People tell you, if somebody'd say, "We," I'll say, "When."  And they didn't even have to say they needed me to come to something.  I was there.  Neighborhood meetings I would just pop in the doors.  Churches, pop in the congregation.  Because I represented this city, I represented this city all over the world, Israel, China, Africa.  You know, and I knew--but they couldn't get me, when they went, when I announced my reelection, they couldn't get me for spending the city's money.  'Cause I was--wouldn't travel if I had to pay to go out of country.  It was always sponsorships through the government of the foreign nations or something.  The only thing that they could get me on was the crime in the area.  And they built it on that.  And why they did that was because I said to them, there was a group of people here in this community who did not, who wanted me to run a whole 'nother slate.  Leave out that the people that I'd worked with my first four years.  Leave them out and--except for one, except for one.  And run a whole different slate that they would help me to come up with.  And I said no.  My integrity was there and going down in the annals of history, how could you put something in there, "Yeah she was taking--," you know, "She, she took the money, and she did this that and the oth- ," unh-uh.  One of the other things that I'm proud of that happened and I knew I wouldn't get the support, was that when the chamber [Savannah Area Chamber of Commerce] and, and some of the other business community did not want our city manager [Stephanie Cutter] to hire a chief of police, and we got shootings going on in here.  And I went to their unannounced meeting, I announced myself, I told them I'd be there.  I knew that they were gonna find somebody to run against me.  I knew that.  The first person they selected was a friend of mine, and, Sonny Dixon.  And Sonny and I talked, he said, "Edna [HistoryMaker Edna Jackson]," he said, "I can't run against you.  You about to become the president of the Georgia Municipal Association. We haven't had that since Floyd Adams [Floyd Adams, Jr.].  And everybody across the state speaks so highly of you and how you work with them."  I was the vice president of GMA at the time.  I was on the national board, on the board of the National League of Cities, all of this.
Story_ID: 657864
Speaker 1: But they had to get me out of there.  So, he [Sonny Dixon] wouldn't run.  Then they got this other man who wanted to run, the present mayor [Eddie DeLoach].  And that is how--and they, they got other blacks to run against other candidates because they knew if they ever push me into a runoff, that we don't go back to the polls.  But, I stood I did everything that I was supposed to do.  When they wanted to do open records requests I said, "So be it."  'Cause I had--I knew I hadn't taken a dime.  When they went to our travel agency, the lady say, "You talking about Mayor Jackson [HistoryMaker Edna Jackson]?  She won't travel none. She'll get on the phone with me and say I found one."  So, my integrity was questioned, so they only could run the campaign on the, they put a sign over my headquarters, "Do you feel safe?"  What has happened?  Did we need more police officers?  When I left office we had hired and--in one year, an additional 122 police officers.  Have you ever seen in the paper--anything in the paper about that?  No, that has not come up.  Under my leadership we became recertified as a police department [Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police Department].  We because certified through the fire department [Savannah Fire and Emergency Services].  You know what, I'm, I'm proud of under my administration?  We saved this city over fifty, was I think was, was it $8 million by refinancing bonds.  I left this city in good financial shape.  You don't get a AAA rating by messing up.  So, I'm proud of my you know, the relationships that I was able to build.  And what I was able to do across this city.  But, I knew that the, that you know, I, I really thought that I may win.  But, when you looked at how the forums were stacked and the things that were coming out in the community.  And I had to maintain my dignity.  Now, I got a saying and I don't know if Otis [HistoryMaker Otis Johnson] told you about this.  You don't ever want to see the West Broad Street [Savannah, Georgia] come out of me.  You know, I told you about the neighborhood that I grew up in. You don't wanna see that side of me.  Well, the good Lord took my voice for one thing.  And so I couldn't talk that much, above a whisper.  'Cause I could, I was known that I can tell you what I thought.  And they would stage people to ask certain questions, they did all kinds of things.  So, you know, I saw my losing as a blessing.  Because, I was still running, trying to get a budget in, a balanced budget, and all of that.
Story_ID: 657865
Speaker 1: But guess what, the day before the runoff I was walking in my office and I couldn't get in the door.  I had to go straight to my doctor.  She didn't tell me, she said, "I'm sending you to the emergency room." Nobody in Savannah [Georgia] knew it, nobody.  I was incognito in my mama's name.  And they got me in and the heart doctor say, "Edna [HistoryMaker Edna Jackson], I'm gonna keep you in for three days.  Your heart rate is thirty-five [beats per minute]."  'Cause when I told her I would drive, she said, "If you drive from this office I will not be your doctor."  They took, before they could leave her office they took about thirty minutes to work on me to get my vitals up.  And I got into the hospital made promises--my son [Kevan Jackson] and Lonnie [Alonzo Adams, Jr.] and everybody was there.  But, nobody knew.  And the next day, I--they said, "We'll let you out at three o'clock."  I said, "Okay, I'm going to do everything you want me to do."  That night I was in my headquarters and I had lost the election.  But, it was God.  Because I had seen my mother and I get tearful with this.  Please excuse me.
Speaker 2: It's okay.
Speaker 1: I wasn't looking like me, everybody kept saying, "Ooh girl you looking like your mama."  I had aged.  And one morning looked like, I got up, I looked in the mirror and I saw my mama.  And said oh my god, you know how you look again.  And then everybody said, "Girl you walking just like Georgia [Georgia Branch Dillard]." That was my mother's name.  And I said, "Really?" I was leaning over I couldn't barely making--I was in therapy for my voice.  So, I took it and then one night I had a dream about my sister, my sister's deceased.  And we--looked like we were on the train.  And I said, "Margie [Margie Reid Williams] we gotta get off the train, we gotta get in a cab, we gotta get in a cab.  Come on we gotta go, we gotta go."  I got in a cab my sister never got in the cab.  And I said, "Margie, get in, get in, get in, get in get in." She just smiled at me and the cab driver started pulling off and my sister (gesture) was waving.  And you know, how do you come out of something like that?  I said, "Oh my god," so it was not for me.  This is my time, this is my time.  I have a pace maker and I volunteer with the women's hearts program [WomenHeart Savannah, Savannah, Georgia].  But, I had given this community over fifty years of my life.
Story_ID: 657866
Speaker 1: You absolutely have given all of yourself.  And they were very lucky to have you in this community in Savannah [Georgia].  In your home.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So, so what's next for you?  You're saying this is your time.  Is there something that you have not done that you want to do?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I need to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What's your, what's your, (unclear) what's your bucket list looking like?
Speaker 2: My bucket list is, I really want to do some travel.  But, because of my honey's health I can't.
Speaker 1: We didn't even talk about your honey.  Do you want to talk about him?
Speaker 2: Sure, we've been together for a very long time.  He lives in his house. I live my mine.
Speaker 1: What is his name?
Speaker 2: His name is Alonzo Adams, Jr.  He's always been there, been very supportive of me.  No matter, if I say that I want to do thus and so, he never asked why.  He's been there for me and you know (pause) this is a time to be there for him.  He has five (unclear) six back surgeries.  And you know, I just.  But, I still go.  I'm working with women hearts [WomenHeart Savannah, Savannah, Georgia].  I was right out there in the rally, I didn't go to Washington [D.C.], but we had a rally right here, of women, and I was one of the speakers.  They always, they wanted me to speak last.  You know, "We got the mayor."  And there has been a follow up session.  I've been speaking for that too.  So, my thing is, is try to tell my story particularly to kids in the school system.  And, to let them know the importance of voting.  You know, and then when I look at what happened I don't, I don't know if, if, if Otis said this to you.  We went to the inauguration of the new mayor.  And Sonny Dixon was the emcee and all of a sudden Sonny Dixon said, "You know, we have two individuals that have given a whole lot to this community.  We have Mayor Otis Johnson [HistoryMaker Otis Johnson] and Mayor Edna Jack- [HistoryMaker] Edna Jackson, let's give me--them an applause, that's just--stand up," you know, so we did.  So then he said, "Otis come to the stage," and Otis went up there and I looked over at Shavon [ph.] I said, "Did Otis know about this?"  And she said, "No, did you know?"  I said, "No."  So, he said everything that he wanted to say about Otis.  He said, "Now you introduce Edna."  This man had just been--the, the new mayor had just been inaugurated, I had just had my surgery (laughter).  So, I said, so Otis did a fantastic job of introducing me.  So, I said, "Oh," so I started moving towards the stage and I don't do steps well, 'cause I've had knee surgeries twice.  Two surgeries.  So, I said, "Lord help me, please put the words in my mouth."  And I you know, I just said, "Lord put the words in my mouth."  So, I was going up the steps in the civic center [Savannah Civic Center, Savannah, Georgia] to the stage and I saw this hand come, you could tell it was a male hand, and I rested my hand in this hand, never looked up.  And I kept--'cause I'm very sensitive about going up steps, when I got up to the stage, here was the new mayor helping me to the stage.  So, I said, "Eddie [Eddie DeLoach] come on go with me."  I walked over to that mic [microphone], now I was dressed to kill now.  I went over to that mic and I thanked them, you know, for everything.  And I said, you know, "But this is Savannah, this is Eddie's dais, and I congratulate him and these members of council [Savannah City Council].  But, we're here to celebrate him.  So, through that I congratulate you, and mayor, so and so and so," and with that I took my butt off that stage.  The audience went wild, 'cause the white people in that audience thought I was going to use that as something to really say.  Look here Sadie Branch [Jackson's maternal grandmother, Sadie Royal Branch] raised me right, okay.  I walked off that stage.  After that ceremony was over, his wife [Cynthia DeLoach] was one of the first people to come up to me, he, she says, "You have--." She said, "I've watched you through this whole process.  You have such grace." She said, "Thank you."
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, now that's my life.
Story_ID: 657867
Speaker 1: Well, before, before we end the conversation I have to go back and ask you about the fact that you spent all these years, fifty years, in community service.  Making sure that people civil rights.  And you become the mayor of a city in Georgia, a major city, Savannah, Georgia, but at the same time, you don't, do you realize how impactful you have been because we also had a very first black president of the United States [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama]?
Speaker 2: And I was there both times (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so there you have it, how do you feel about the fact, or do you even realize what impact you have in even being a part, just a little piece 'cause it takes a little piece to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know--
Speaker 1: --to bring this all together.
Speaker 2: You know, you sound, you sound, you sound like my son and we didn't--I didn't tell you but I have the most wonderful son in the world.  My son is an engineer.  He's a program manager at Gulfstream [Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation] here in Savannah.  The beauty of that is, is that he's never had to apply for a job either.  His work ethics followed mine.  You know, all the jobs alwa- always sought him, he interned there.  You know, I'm so proud of him. He's out in California; I guess he's still out there. He travels all over the world.  He's a program manager for the Gulfstream 650s [Gulfstream G650] now.  My little boy, my little Kevan Jackson that I love dearly.  But, he was raised that way.  But, even when he went to get a job, people didn't know who I was.  I mean when we was out that working.  How they found out about him that I was his mama, they recommended him for black engineer of the year.  And I went to Baltimore [Maryland].  And I was talking to his boss and telling him we had just passed on the--he said, "How did you know that?"  I said, "I am the mayor pro tem."  He said, "Kevan never told us."  So, he got his stuff on his own merits, wonderful.  But, anyway back to it.  Me, I'm just plain old [HistoryMaker] Edna Jackson.  I don't look for, I don't, I've never done anything for recognition.  I'm just as comfortable sitting at a table with everybody, you know, they say like you could walk with kings but never lose the common touch.  That's how I've been taught.  That's how people that touch my life taught me.  I stand on the shoulders of some great leaders in this country.  People that saw something in me that I didn't see myself.  And I can't write no book, I'm not--that's not Edna Jackson.
Speaker 1: So, you won't write a book?
Speaker 2: No, a suggestion has been made, that maybe I should have somebody--first I don't like to write, the next thing is that I should get some students or something to shadow me.  Because, so much of the history of this city is not known.  And there's so many unsung heroes, here, that were a part of the movement that no peo- that people don't really know about.  I've got my, I got all kinds of recognitions all over there.  I'm just Edna.
Story_ID: 657868
Speaker 1: It's not so much of doing things to be recognized, but when you--my pastor always says, "Does it matter that you were here?"  And so that's my question, do you feel that it mattered because you were here?
Speaker 2: Yes, because I, I really I, I will always that it does matter.  Because, I've never been afraid of anything.  I've never been afraid to stand alone.  I have, I've never thought about what I would get out of something. It is all about the good that it does for others that I can do, for others.  You know, it bothers me when I see people and I know some, that will put stuff in the paper that they didn't earn.  'Cause I know the story, I know the real truth.  And their time will come.  I have more awards and recognitions than I will, all, I appreciate everything that everyone does.  But, I always tell them, yeah, it's, my honor comes when I see my students and they have finished their Ph.D.'s.  Or I see a life that I've touched, a person that has been to jail and they now have a job.  That's what I like to do.  When my sorority, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority honored me by, by naming a scholarship in my name [Edna Branch Jackson Community Service Scholarship].  You know, those are the kinds, I didn't ask I didn't even want them, and I didn't know about.  Had I known about it I probably would have said no.  You know, those are the things those are the recognitions that come because, again people saw it in me that I didn't see in me.  That my Savannah State University [Savannah, Georgia] gave me the highest award that has ever been given, the Richard R. Wright [Richard R. Wright Award of Excellence].  I had to tell the president [Cheryl Davenport Dozier], I have so many recognitions from Savannah State from the alumni, the foundation.  I had to tell them, "Please don't give me no more."  What's gonna do--what's gonna happen to all of this stuff, they're in boxes, they're on walls, they're all over this house.  I had to move some stuff to another (unclear).  My life is about all of the accomplishments that I've made helping other people.
Story_ID: 657869
Speaker 1: So what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I want my legacy to be, well, I wouldn't say, that you could always depend on [HistoryMaker] Edna Jackson.  And there have been times when you know, I really didn't feel like doing something, or I just didn't have the energy.  But, it seems like whenever if I, I felt like if I said no, that I was disappointing someone.  You know, I got, I, god, you know, I look at things.  I guess I look at things, the good that I've done.  And leave at that.  You know, and I did all this stuff and still was the caregiver for grandmother [Sadie Royal Branch], my aunt [Lillie Branch], my mother [Georgia Branch Dillard], my sister [Margie Reid Williams] who was in a diabetic coma for sixteen months.  But, I did everything out of joy.  Because if I didn't do it, I always felt, who else they're gonna get, you know, to, to really follow through on things.  So, my life you know, I look at my and I want, this is the one thing I told I have one son I gave birth to [Kevan Jackson].  But, I have six children, my ex-husband [George Jackson] and my wife in law children.  My wife in law has had a massive stroke.  My children, because she couldn't hold the grandchild, they said, "Mama you got to hold the grandbaby first.  You have to do this, you have to do," they'll say, they respect me and I respect them.  And I've always done things to show people that people may not be together they can re- truly respect each other.  And that is what my life is.  I want my life to be an example for whole lot of folks out there that I hear, that I hear complaining out there.  That's what I want my life to be.  Why complain, if you ain't gonna do nothing about it?  That's why I wanna be remembered.  And I wanna be reme- you know, rem- (laughter).  I have to laugh, we're reorganizing, well a group is reorganizing, League of Women Voters.  And now they've asked me to come in and help them.  You know, they--sure I'm gonna do that, 'cause I want women to vote.  And then another group called WIN [Women's Information Network], you may have heard of WIN.  They work to get women elected.  And if they get the person that they want elected to go to [U.S.] Congress from the Atlanta [Georgia] area, I'm going to be, I'll be right there in the number.  Because, that is what we're supposed to do.  You can't have it all. I can't have everything.  You know, other--we have to help other people reach their goals.  If you leave it all for yourself because of the I--one of the things, one of my, one of my dear friends' former professors and one of my mentors taught me.  And I used to tell my council, they used to get sick of me saying it.  It is not about the I, it is about the we.  Because you can't do anything by yourself.  It take people working together.  That is what this co- that's what this country needs to be about.  That is what this city [Savannah, Georgia], city has to be about.  People, no matter their ethnicity, it is about us all coming together working together, I don't care whether white, black, purple, gay, lesbian, transgender be whatever you wanna be.  But, let's come together for the good of all. That's what I'm about.  And that's how I want, I want people to say, "Yeah you see her.  See she was gonna be at the pride festival.  She was gonna be at this, the Jewish center.  She was gonna be at black heritage festival.  She, she was gonna be at the cathedral for the Irish, you know for the St. Patrick's Day."  That's the--it kills, it's killing my, you know, I was there because that is what Edna Jackson is all ab- not because I always wanted to be.  But, I had to be the person that showed this community that you could always depend and that I was always going to be there for you.
Story_ID: 657870
Speaker 1: Well said Mayor Jack- Mayor Jackson.  Is there anything that we have not talked about that you would like to talk about?
Speaker 2: I think what, what, what is bothering me right now is the world today.  The United States today.  I am so disgusted.  So unhappy and I don't know all the words without just being downright nasty about it.  Of the things that are happening here when people don't have respect for a woman, that bothers me.  And now you can see it going on and passing on down into your congressional people too.  You got a woman speaking and then you're gonna treat them different than you treat the male that can come the next day.  Oh no, this is the time that we gotta start the fight all over again.  The fight is not over.  It's just in the form of another way.  And if we don't open our eyes to what is happening today, we'll be out there marching again, for the rights of people.  And you know, what's the old cliche? They came for so and so, and so and I didn't--I wasn't there, but let me tell you.  I tell everybody look at Hitler [Adolf Hitler] and what happened during Hitler days.  Look what happened to the Irish community.  You know, you look here, if we aren't out there helping each other you can believe me that these United States of America will go back to the days, back to the days.  Well I can't even say we're fou- when we're founded, because we've never treated the Indians [Native American] like they should or should have been treated.  No, America is a nation of all.  Amer- America, what is give us your tired your poor?  We have opened our arms up to all people.  But, we also have to learn and respect all people.  And you can't put one group down because of what one person has said.  We must lift it up, like, like Michelle Obama said.  When they go low, we have to go high.  And that is [HistoryMaker] Edna Jackson.
Speaker 1: Well, I want to thank you so much for taking the time to tell your story.  You did a fantastic job.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: And this is going to be a tape that the future generations can look at, hear your voice and see your face and your enthusiasm about what you have done.  And learn all the things that you have accomplished and be an encouragement to someone that just take one step.  I mean you took so many steps and kept one foot in front of the other.  So--
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: --this will definitely be an encouragement for the future generations.
Speaker 2: Thank you, thank you.  And my little--it's my only house I bought for myself, me and my son [Kevan Jackson].
