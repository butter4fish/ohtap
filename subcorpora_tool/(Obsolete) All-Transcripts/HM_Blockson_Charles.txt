I've been collecting since my early childhood days in the fourth grade, long be--before African American history or black history became popular.  So over the years, I accumulated a, a large collection in 1984.  I donated over 20,000 items with books, manuscripts, broadside pamphlets and prints and other material relating to people of the African Diaspora to Temple University, where I'm now curator.

Speaker 1: Before we get into depth, there are five "People" magazine-ish kind of questions that we always ask.  And they just require a short answer.  The first one is, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food?  I guess we must--I must say soul food, which comprised of, you know, the food that our ancestors ate.  But the one I really care for the most is sweet potato pie.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My color varies between bluish--blue--between blue and green.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: The fall.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Usually it's the Caribbean, Africa, or Paris.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Those three.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or saying.
Speaker 2: The hand that holds the quill, pen, or pencil controls history.
Speaker 1: I agree.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 66146
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your beginnings.  Can you please give us the names of your parents and spell them for us, please, and the dates of their birth if you could?
Speaker 2: Well, going back, my--starting with my father, my father is Charles Edward Blockson.  And he was born in Norristown, Pennsylvania, which is eighteen miles from Philadelphia.  He was born in October--was born in 1915.  And my mother was from Asheville, North Carolina.  Her mother was part Cherokee and Native American from Asheville, and she was born in 1914.  Her name is Annie Blockson, and she passed away about twelve years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, could you please spell the, the names for us?
Speaker 2: The first names?
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.
Speaker 2: Charles L., C-H-A-R-L-E-S, Charles Edward Blockson is the middle name.  And my mother's name was Annie, A-N-N-I-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Annie Parker Blockson.
Speaker 1: Did, did your parents have a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was the only child.  My father had one brother.  And during the, the migration of the 1920s, my mother's, my mother's aunt, who--my--her mother, my grandmother was an invalid in Asheville, North Carolina, but she gave my mother to her sister to raise.  And they came to North to Norristown, Pennsylvania, at first around 1923, where my great-great uncle, my aunt's husband, was a schoolteacher in the South.  However, he couldn't find a job up here because they weren't really hiring Negros or colored people in those days, teachers, so nevertheless, they--when my mother came to Norristown, she met my father.  And I think they were in junior high school when they first met.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And my father's people came originally from Southern Delaware--originally from Virginia, Accomack County, Virginia.  And the white slave owner, when they was Blockson, B-L-O-X-S-O-N, was the original spelling, moved to Sussex, Delaware, Seifert.  And there in Seifert, I had my great-great-great-grandfather.  I traced my genealogy, found later on that my great-grandfather escaped in the Underground Railroad, came to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], met with the great chronicler of the Underground Railroad, William Steele, an African American.  And later other members of my family escaped and went to Canada.  Some of them stayed in Canada and came--while others came back.  My great-grandfather came back and his cousin, Jacob Blockson, escaped with Harriet Tubman.  Harriet Tubman's home in Bucktown, Maryland in Dorchester County wasn't that far from Seifert Sussex County, Delaware, so I have that whole background.  And as I said before, my father and mother met between junior high school and high school.
Story_ID: 66147
Speaker 1: Okay, what--do you have--you have any more detailed information about what your ancestors were doing in the nineteenth century that you can share?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, because this is my background.  I've written the--I wrote the first book on black genealogy shortly after my late friend, Alex Haley, died back in 1977.  Then I did extensive work by being a bibliophile, a collector of books and all.  I had all the documents of letters and, and pertain--letters of Douglass, Frederick Douglass, and, and books that extends into Africa.  So I had that background, there again, when it wasn't popular, long before the '60s [1960s].  And I was collecting and people used to say what are you collecting those, those old Negro books for or, or those old colored books?  But I kept my eyes on the prize, and, and never did I realize that I would one day be lecturing and writing on it.  So I have the original Phillis Wheatley poems; I have the original Nat Turner confessions and so forth.  When students come here, I can show them that and letters of the Harlem Renaissance.  I collected the whole of our history, from children's books, from even "Little Black Sambo" to the Harlem Renaissance to, to travel, lectures, African, Caraben--Caribbean--and so forth.  So my idol later was Arthur Schomburg, who--the great bibliophile, whom the Schomburg Research Center in New York City in Harlem is named for.  So I didn't really know about him in the beginning, and later I discovered him when I would travel to New York for an indoor track or a football game, or whatever I came across.  At first I didn't know, really.  I went to New York before, however, I never went alone to Harlem.  And I--one day I said, how do I go to Harlem?  Of course, I would go to Greenwich Village or the bookstore in the Village.  And I said, well, I should go up to Harlem to the Schomburg, but I didn't know the subway, which, which subway to take.  So I remember one of my idols in the jazz world, Duke Ellington's song--
Speaker 1: Take the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: "Take the 'A' Train" to Harlem, so I went to Harlem, and I came to the Schomburg Center, and I fell in love there.  And later, in New York City, I had a mentor, and I discovered him by the name of Lewis Michaux.  He had the National Memorial Bookstore, and that just opened a new world.  He sort of became my mentor and encouraged me.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir, I, I understand, but we, we need to go back a little bit before we--you're in a tra--tradition of, of Michaux and Schomburg--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and David Ruggles--
Speaker 2: Right, so you know.
Speaker 1: --and Slaughter--
Speaker 2: Slaughter, yeah--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --even, even here in Philadelphia--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --which, which was a mecca.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Webster Slaughter and Jesse Morlands.
Speaker 2: Yeah, all of them, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They're all in--they're all in my book.
Story_ID: 66148
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, but, but, but we--I wanted to talk about your ancestors and the nineteenth century--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --talk about your childhood, and then we, we--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --we'll, we'll get into--
Speaker 2: Well, starting back again.  You know, one of the most devastating events, which I more or less record in my memoirs is the fact that I had a, a yearning to know who I was.  I always loved history and ancient history, modern history, history pertaining to people of African descent, whatever.  But I was always sort of shocked, ashamed, and saddened when other classmates, I'd never had a black--an African-American teacher in my life, so.  And when my other classmates could tell--trace their ancestors to Alfred the Great, William the Conqueror, and such, and I used to--and the few of us who were Negroes or African-Americans at the time would put our head down because our ancestry, as far as we knew, was slavery.  And, and one day I said--I used to say to myself, I wish that someday that I'll be able to trace my ancestor.  But I did have the advantage of sitting around listening to the older folks talk.  I always listened to other folks--older folks--around in the backyard, on the, on the steps, what they said about the South, what they said about slavery, not that much it was so painful, but I made a quest that once I start to, to collect books by Carter G. Woodson and Du Bois and others, that gave me the inspiration to trace my own genealogy.  And I located information at the Hall of Records in Dover, Delaware.  I came across one day--it's called the Hall of Records.  Some people called it the State Archives or whatever.  I was sitting at the--on--at the table with old huge oak table with chairs, and I came across the will of John Blockson.  And then I started to read the will, and then he came across the name of Spencer Blockson.  The name Spencer registered in my mind because in our family Bible, as I recall, it said Spencer died in his 70th year, but that's all I knew at the time.  But I connected and the listing of the slave register a John Blockson willed Spencer to his son.  And he had seven other slaves, a Harry and, and Polly, who I found out to be my great-great-great-grandparents.  He listed them, dividing them among his children.  I pounded the desk.  I became down (unclear) started to perspire.  I, I came down with such a, a hatred, a hatred to see that my ancestors was listed among cattle, burlap, corn and whatever; so, therefore, that was the beginning.  Later, I discovered after the slave owner moved from Accomack County, Virginia, to Sussex County, Delaware, Seifert, he owned 360 acres.  And then I found out that he--they had other slaves of Blockson.  But from there, later I found that my ancestors escaped on the Underground Railroad.  So from that point, at an early age I had an interest in the Underground Railroad.
Speaker 1: Now how old when you first discovered this?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: As I started before, throughout my quest to, to seek my identity, I started in my subconscious mind I guess, perhaps when I was in the fourth, fifth or sixth grade--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --but then later on, as I started to collect and put things together through history, it took me about twenty-three years to complete my genealogy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Some people can--you know, will take years to get--some people will never be able to trace it because of--they were adopted or what other--whatever; however, other people can do it.  But I was fortunate; I was able to trace it back to Nigeria.  And I discovered I, I belonged to the Ebos, of, of Southern Nigeria, so I was lucky that way.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir, okay.  Now, on--is that on one side or both sides?
Speaker 2: My mother's side of the family, as I said before, was Native American and African American.  She was the only child.  I could only go back to my, my grandmother on her side of the family.
Speaker 1: And on your father's side, you can take all, all the way back to Ebolian (unclear), right?
Speaker 2: Ebolian, yeah.
Story_ID: 66149
Speaker 1: Okay.  I want you to reflect on, on your, on your childhood and tell me about some of the, the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up in--did you grow up in Norristown [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Grew up in Norristown [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Yeah, what, what, what, what was the neigh--neighborhood like, and what did it look like, and what was it, you know?
Speaker 2: Our neighborhood was traditional.  As you--as I stated earlier, Norristown, Pennsylvania, is located seven miles in Valley Forge [Pennsylvania], about fifteen miles from Bryn Mawr [Pennsylvania], the main line, Bryn Mawr College and all that, and eighteen miles from Philadelphia.  Whatever happened in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] spilt over into the suburbs.  Norristown was the county seat of Montgomery County, which was a very wealthy county and also farms and all that.  But looking back, reflecting in my years of growing up, I had an advantage of being associated with people of all races, creeds, and colors on my street, Lafayette Street, of course named for the famous general (unclear)--war.  There were the Greeks; there was (unclear), Jews, Irish, Pollock--Polish people--I shouldn't say Pollock--Polish people, and African American.  We all had a common bond, so to speak.  It was poverty, but poverty in, in a sense of not being poor.  We could share food; we could share laughter; we could share tears and whatev--whatever.  So, it wasn't a monetary wealth, but it was a wealth of experience of knowing early to (unclear) or to relate to people of all races, creeds, and colors.  Yes, there were pov--there was in my hometown.  We had segregated theaters.  We could not sit downstairs in the theaters.  There were certain restaurants we couldn't go to.  We all went to the same high school from--integrated high school from kindergarten--first grade--they didn't have kindergarten in those days--through the twelfth.  However, even then, you know, I oft--often pondered, as I did later on at Penn State [Pennsylvania State University] in college while playing football or track or basketball or whatev, whatever, we could share the lot for, for Norristown High School whatever.  We, we, we were together, but as soon as the event was over, we went our separate ways; it was de facto segregation.  And I can--will never say that I did not grow up with segregation.  Segregation hovered around me and over me, whatever.  But even at that point, I realized that, that there were people of all races, creeds, and colors who weren't specifically bigoted.  Some of them were ignorant.  Ignorance is the worse form of slavery.  They were taught--programmed--things about African Americans in our school books and so forth, which is still happening, like Dr. Carter G. Woodson later said in 1933, the year I was born.  He wrote a famous book named Mis-Education ["The Mis-Education of the Negro"].  We all have received a mis-education up until this point.
Story_ID: 66150
Speaker 1: All right, so, what kind of little boy were you when you were growing up--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I was more or less--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I was always big for my age--well, big.  I'm six three now, you know, but six three in those days, six one, I was always large in school.  I mean it's like I was always well built.  In those days, we weren't permitted to lift weights and all that, but I was always drawn to athletics.  From the grade school, we had about six or seven grade schools.  We had teams: football, basketball, and track, and whatever.  So from my earliest years, my first medal was a medal in the shot put in grade school championship and the high jump, and later on it was my athletics.  I started my athletic career around that time in the backyard, my backyard, on the sandlots, and later on the high--grade school, junior high school, and high school fields.  There again, it was the period where I was more or less an introvert.  When I was first--when I was born I should say, my mother was told--my parents were told I wouldn't--I probably wouldn't live.  I had double pneumonia, rheumatic fever, and a heart murmur, and I had difficulty talking at an early age, so that placed me in a predicament, so to speak.  I became more or less a shy person, a loner, but not alone.  But nevertheless, people were always drawn to me; first, perhaps it was my athletic ability.  But I always read; I read a lot, and one day I started to read--I guess in junior high school, our history teacher, who was my football coach--about Themistocles, Themistocles, the great Greek orator, how he had a problem with speaking, and he'd place pebbles.  If you read the autobiography of James Earl Jones, the great actor, he's had the same problems.  And I was amazed when I read the same thing, where he placed pebbles.  I used to walk along the Schuylkill River, the river that flows between Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and my hometown and so forth, and pick up pebbles and practice speaking and so forth.  So my heavy lisp and shyness at the time sort of propelled me into this predicament of being a loner.  But however, as I said, in school and all that, I was very popular.  Even then, I was a loner, shy, quiet type of a person.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How, how many brothers and sisters do you have and what--
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest of eight.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you're the oldest of eight.  Did you have a lot of responsibility coming up--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: A lot of responsibility--first responsibility was as a role model, you know.  And I had role models early, the older people, the senior citizens around me, in men and women.  In those days, which was traditional of any African-American community, whether you grew up in Dayton [Ohio], New Orleans [Louisiana], Los Angeles [California], Boston [Massachusetts], Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], New York [New York], we had the extended family.  Everybody on our block sort of looked out for the other per--and respect--we had--we grew up saying "yes sir," and "no ma'am"; we had to respect our elders.  So therefore, I had people.  Early I discovered my lifelong hero, Paul Robeson.  I was drawn to him at an early age 'cause my father, my grandfather, my parents--grandfather had his records and such, and being an, an athlete, I was thrilled.  I always stood by him, and years later, I, I was able to meet him.  Last time I saw him was a month and a half before he died.  I was one of the few people in the world to see him here in Philadelphia.  But at the time, although we weren't taught about certain role models in school--of course we had Harriet Tubman, Booker T. Washington, George Washington Car--Carver, maybe Langston Hughes, maybe James Weldon Johnson at the time, but even during those times, I had outside role models, of course Joel A. Rogers, whom I later met, and Carter G. Woodson, the people that--
Speaker 1: Joel, Joel Augustus Rogers--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's Joel Augustus Rogers.
Speaker 1: J-O-E-L Augustus Rogers, he was a Jamaican historian.
Speaker 2: Jamaican historian who wrote the first book From Man to Superman ["From 'Superman' to Man"]--that was my bible--then "World's Great Men of Color," Volumes I and II; and "Sex and Race" Revived; Nature (unclear).  So one day I met Mr. [Joel] Rogers at Mr. Michaux's Bookstore in Harlem.
Speaker 1: Now, now is this when you were a teenager or is this when--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: This was, this was in, in college in--(simultaneous)--
Story_ID: 66151
Speaker 1: So you were asking me about my grade school, my teachers.  I had one particular teacher, Mrs. Walburn [ph.]. She was what we call here in, in Pennsylvania Pennsylvanian-Dutch or Pennsylvanian-German-type--a stern teacher, but a, a teacher with, with lack of prejudice, as I recall her.  One day, she, she asked us to select a school project.  We could select, select three poems to recite or to take a history project and go out into the community to record the old buildings and sights and such.  And I chose history, and that was the beginning, I guess, more or less, of my interest in local history.  From that project, I turned my paper in and I got an A, and I was complimented.  From, from then on she encouraged me to stay with history and such.  I remember her; I remember my two high school coaches.  My football coach in junior high school was John Sweeney, an Irishman, and Harry Spangler.  He was a--from Harrisburg, a Germ--of German descent.  They were instrumental in my--later, my coach, John Sweeney, when I went to my high school my junior year--my sophomore year--he became as my football coach.  Then I remember my track coach, who was Leroy Pete Lewis, who developed a lot of champions.  He, he coached my father when my father was in high school and track and football.  So, they were inspir--inspira--inspirational to me in high school.  And there were--it was a teacher by the name of Ms. Brady, who taught English.  She perked my interest in the Shakespeare's plays with "Othello" and things like that.  I always had a love for music--all types of music, from the spiritual, folk, gospel, jazz, whatever.  So--but I--at that time, I, I didn't have any interest per se although we had class on, on opera.  I didn't develop my interest in opera until later on, so.
Story_ID: 66152
Speaker 1: During those formatively--those years, besides playing sports, I had--I developed an interest in chess also.  But my most important hobby, even today, is reading books, not just books about our culture, people of African descent, but I was always drawn in the early days of the so-called--in those days, of the, the avant-garde, Bohemia, the Greenwich Village.  I had an interest in Greenwich Village and all that because I read about, you know, the writers of the '20s [1920s], the, the ex-patriots and such that went on to Europe.  And I developed a great interest there.  And I also had an interest in books about books, and literature, and, and art.  And I had also, of course, primarily, besides reading the ex-patriots, you know, white and black--from Langston Hughes, [Ernest] Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, or some of the others--I had an interest also in biographies--all kinds of people, ancient--from ancient times to the present.
Speaker 2: Had you come across [Joel A.] Rogers work at that time yet?
Speaker 1: I came across Joel A. Rogers' work be--I guess I was in--I think I was in--yeah, I was in the seventh or eighth grade, eighth grade.  My father would always--he loved books too.  He was a-he, he was a plasterer.  He had his own--first of all, he worked in the steel mill.  He became the first black open hearth operator, first helper; that's the person who o--operates the ovens.  He had to fight his way to get it, you know, but he--you know, he took that for a while, then he became a plasterer, a white--he had a white-wash business, plastering and painting.  So I grew up painting houses in the main line and all that.  And some time in these houses and all, people would have old books, and--(unclear)--just take the books and all that.  So he developed a love for books and antiques.  Although I was the oldest of eight, I had all these antiques and, and books and around me.  So therefore, I learned about [Joel A.] Rogers through the fact that my father would collect--he would purchase or buy the black newspapers, the "Chicago Defender," the "Philadelphia Tribune," the "Afro-American," the Pittsburgh Courier," and the "Amsterdam News" from New York.  As you know, from reading the "Pittsburgh Courier," Joel A. Rogers had a column there.  I would read his column and Ollie Harrington with Bootsie, so therefore, I--
Speaker 2: You--your history--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh yes.  And so therefore, I de--developed an interest in this man Rogers, because he would have these different facts about our people that I never heard of before, you know.  And therefore, I started to read.  And one day I acquired extra money.  I bought a copy of his book From Man to Superman ["From 'Superman' to Man"], and that just blew my mind about what our people did in history.  Then of course today I have all of his books, and then later on, as I said, I met him.
Story_ID: 66153
Speaker 1: Now, now when, when you're in high school, you--were you, you much of a scholar in high school?
Speaker 2: I was--my worse subject was mathematics, you know.  I mean, I was a fair scholar.  My best subject was always history--the humanities--history, psychology and all the others.  As far as writing, no, literature, yes, but I, I flunked--later I flunked--I'm jumping ahead.  I flunked English Composition twice at Penn State before I passed it.  Writing was not my forte.  But to--in retrospect, looking back, you know I have written about, about eleven books and plus quite a few articles and, and so forth.  And even today, speaking before large audiences and so forth, it's like I say sometimes, am I the same person, you know, who was shy, introvert and such?  But I learned throughout life, whatever your soul force is, you have to follow it, you know.  If I had to listen to people who said, what are you expecting collecting those old Negro books, old black books, or colored books for, you know, I would have lost so much.  My book collecting excursions have led me into the lives of many important people.  And the fact that I can be able to provide information for people who come to this collection from all over the world--and many of prominent people in our history today have been to this collection, school children, inner city's children; people from all over the world has been here, so I'm fortunate.  Some people, I think--you know, as you grow old they said: I wish I had of done this; I wish I have done that; what did I do with my life?  You know, I'm blessed.  I have a profession of an--and the ability to enjoy what my destiny and life is.  I know what my destiny in life is.  If I was to die today or tomorrow, you know, I could say, or someone would say, that he made a difference; he provided knowledge.  First I started, started out as a collector.  My object in life was --excuse me--to was to collect, preserve, and to dis--disseminate the information that, that I have come across.
Story_ID: 71366
Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduating from high school, did you have a conception of what did you--of what you wanted to do with the rest of your life?
Speaker 2: My first ambition during that time was to be in athletics, to be--become--I always had history in the back of my mind, but I always wanted to--my first ambition was to be too--one, early in my life--till I get to your question--was to be a minister, then later I knew I couldn't be a minister, then the archaeola--archaeologagis--archaeologist, then history, then a coach, you know, of foot--athletic coach--football or track.
Speaker 1: Now were you, were you, were you--you were drafted by Penn State [University], right, to--were you--did you sign some sort--I mean, at, at the time you graduated from high school did you know you were gonna play football at Penn State?
Speaker 2: Well, during that time, I had many--I had, I had close to forty different of--forty different offers from colleges all over 'cause I was State champ, National Indoor champion in shot and discus and, and All-State football and all that, so I had a lot of scholarships.  But what--the one that hooked me on to Penn State was that it was where we had our--the Pennsylvania State high school as track championships in, in--during those days.  It was up in the Valleys of--it's a little over 180 miles from Philadelphia.  It was up in the mountains and so forth, so we had--I fell in love with the place at the time and at the time, they had a few African Americans.  I can remember they had two, was, was Barney Yule, who was a great Olympic track, track championship.  He was there, then Wally Tripplet and Denny Hargett, who played in 1947's Cotton Bowl game.  They were my heroes at Penn State.  But I had scholarships to the University of Illinois and [University of] Michigan, and a lot of the black school and so forth.  But Penn State was really where I, I wanted to go at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you ended up going to Penn State right, right after, after--a year after high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, during that time in high school, at my high school, one of my great relationships more or less occurred in high school, and we're the best friends today--I had a chance to compete against Lenny Moore, Lenny Moore, who later played at Penn State [University], and went on to Baltimore Colts, and now he's part of the football--part of the professional Football Hall of Fame.  We were rivals in high school.  Our first, first--our last game--my first game of my last year, they beat us 19-13.  Lenny scored all the touchdowns for Reading, his high school, and I scored the two for, for our school, so they beat us by one touchdown.  And then, I was--later I met--at Penn State [University] we became roommates.  Then I met another person I've heard about and never had a chance of meeting until I--he became my roommate also, was Rosey Grier--Roosevelt Grier--you know, the great New York Giant football-LA [Los Angeles] Rams and who was with Robert Kennedy and such.  So, at the time at Penn State there was another great person there from New Rochelle, New York, Jesse Arnell, who became the great basketball player, who has head of one of the largest law firms today.  So I had those--they, they are my teammates, my football teammates and so forth.  Of course I was on the track team there and all.
Story_ID: 71367
Speaker 1: Te--tell me about your football career at Penn State and your track career.  What, what, what are the highlights?
Speaker 2: Well, the football career, I had--my, my first--we had freshman football in those days, and we had to play freshman sports.  Freshmen couldn't compete during those years, so I was on the freshman team.  When I made the, the Freshman Honor Roll for shot and discus throughout the nation, I was second--(unclear)--the third best in the country in the, in the, in the discus and the shotput, and the second best in the district in, in the, in the country in the discus throw.  But then my sophomore year we, we won the, the IC for, for age was the--(unclear) Collegiate Athletic Association Track Championship at Randall's Island in New York, and we played football.  In those days, we had to play both ways, and we played against several Midwestern teams.  We didn't play Ohio State until the year I--until 1957.  Then I played--I had a chance to meet some of the athletes from the University of Illinois and black athletes and so forth, so that widened our experience.  But those years--then my junior year I pulled my hamstring muscle because I have huge thighs, and I missed four, four games.  And in my senior year, I got an offer from the New York--St. Louis Cardinals, Cleveland Browns, and New York Giants.  So I went to the football training camp at Winooski Park in Vermont with the New York Giants.  However, during the camp, I decided [sneeze]--excuse me--I didn't wanna play football anymore.  I remember Vince Lombardi came over and said, you know, we could use you, such and such, 'cause Rosey Grier was there and Emlen Tunnell, the great defensive person.  Emlen's not too far from us in Norristown at Radnor's so I knew Em.  But I decided then that I wanted to do something else than sports.  And people said well, you're a fool; you have an opportunity to play football and all that.  There was only a few African Americans--you can count them on two hands--in the country that were playing at the time.  But I always try to follow my soul force.  Something told me that there's something different for you.  From then I had a--after there, I left and went to the service, the Army, at Fort Dix, and I played on the football team at Fort Dix.  We had a lot of people, All-American such and such.  We had an 8-2 season.  Then I was sent overseas to Korea.  Overseas in Korea, I was football player-coach; I coached and played in Korea.  And I was also on the track team, the (unclear) Easton track team.  And after my years in the service, two years in service, I came out and I got married and that's (unclear).

Speaker 1: Okay, so, what, what career goal did you pursue after you got out?
Speaker 2: I didn't pursue any career goals at that time.  I, I--at the time, I--for a while I worked, I worked as a--I started my own business, which was a janitorial service, you know, doing--shampooing large apartments and offices, and such and such.  You know, it was, it was a pretty good business.  But then I got a call from our school district stating that they would like me to come and help them out with their situation because of the phenomenon of busing was occurring throughout the country.  In Norristown [Pennsylvania], we always had integrated schools as I'd said earlier.  However, they'd built a new high school, and by building a new high school, they moved it out--still was in the district, but at a distance, where they wanted to bus African-American children to these distant grade schools and high schools.
Speaker 1: Now, now about what time is this?  What, what, what year is this, this is going on?
Speaker 2: Nineteen--about 1970--1973.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, we, we, we probably skipped over a lot.
Speaker 2: We--but the other side was when I had my business.  I just--from the--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --from, from--
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 71369
Speaker 1: About how you got really fired up about this search for history by meeting Lewis Michaux in college.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, see, all, all during that time--
Speaker 1: --J.A. Rogers--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but all during that time, between the time I was in be, be--between the time I met Mr. [Lewis] Michaux and Mr. [Joel A.] Rogers--this was in, in high school, in high school--that wa--that was the beginning.  When I won the National Indoor Shotput Championship in Madison Square Garden and I went to the, to Greenwich Village was a store down there by Walter Goldwater, who had a bookstore.  You know, these--he knew [Arthur] Schomburg and [Joel Alias] Spingarn and all those people--the University Place Bookshop.  And I would go down there and get books and all that.  Then, as I said before, I made a point--I wanted to go to the Schomburg to see the Schomburg I'd heard so much about.  That's when I met Mr. Michaux.  When I met--was on my way to the Schomburg on 125th Street, I saw a sign, "National Memorial Bookstore," so that's when I went in and that's--I met Mr. Michaux.  And from that period, every other week and every couple of weeks, I would go to the bookstore.  I met Langston Hughes there one day.  One day he was coming in, and Mr. Michaux would call and say, allow me, Brother Blockson, from Philadelphia--so I lived in--outside of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]--he said, Langston, come here.  I want you to meet a, a collector, a friend of mine.  So I was here meeting Langston Hughes.  He was, he was in a hurry.  He shook my hand and said keep collecting.  And another time was I was up there--
Speaker 1: This is--let's go--let's stop a second.  This is exciting.  Now you're a young man.  How old are you?
Speaker 2: Well, I was in--well, in, in my twenties, late, mid-twenties.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and, and here you are, you're, you're--you, you going over to the National Memorial Bookstore, and describe what it looked like 'cause people--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, well, bookstores--
Speaker 1: --that it--that it has a remarkable appearance.
Speaker 2: It, it had books--it was books on the outside, you know.  It's the National Memorial Bookstore.  It has signs of African people over the window of, of--(unclear)--and how--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Haile Selassie.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--of the black--
Speaker 2: --the (unclear) president of, of, of, of, of, you know, and, and, and outstanding people in African history.  And there was books all over the book place.  However, Mr. Michaux had a policy.  He was a sma--small wiry man.  Elder Michaux--it was his brother--was a famous evangelist.  But he gave me the history held--when he first came to Harlem back in the twenties, he said he couldn't hardly sell a da--a dollar worth of books to black people (unclear).  They started to get into the fact--this was shortly after Garveyites and all that.  They would come in and all that, and Richard Moore, Mr. Moore, had the Frederick Douglass Bookstore in Harlem.  I discovered him a little later.  But however, Mr. Michaux had books all over the place, you know.  If he liked you, he would take you to his back room where he had his rare, rare books.  So he took a liking to me early, so like, I bought a lot of the rare books from him plus the other books.  And one day I was in the store I met Alice Childress there one day, the great playwright, writer, and so forth.
Story_ID: 71370
Speaker 1: And I--one day I was in there alone--this was him and I.  I came in there early.  We're just sitting there talking, and who would walk into the store but Malcolm X.  And I just, I just like, still could see him as plain as day, you know, the look that he has, (unclear) straight ahead and it's like his eyes could penetrate.  Brother Mic--Mr. Michaux said, "Brother Malcolm, want you meet a brother--friend of mine, Brother Blockson.  He's a collector."  It took--it seemed like it took five minutes before Malcolm spoke, you know.   And Mr. Michaux was talking, and the first thing he said, "Brother, what woke you up?  What woke you up?"  He shook my hand.  Well, after hearing the fact that I was collecting early and that, you know--he said, "What woke you up?"  I'll never forget that, you know.  And we talked for a few minutes and such.  And he was trying to--he was on the way to give a lecture somewhere.  He wanted some information.  He said that John Henrik, Dr. John Henrik Clarke, told him to come by for a certain book, you know.  At that time I didn't know--I didn't meet Dr. John Henrik Clarke personally, but years we became friends--years later we became friends.  But he said, "John told me to come and get a certain book.  I gotta give a talk somewhere."  So he said, "Brother, keep collecting," and he smiled.  But after he found out who I was--but it's the way that, you know, suspectingly, he's looked at you.  Although Mr. Michaux was well known, he's a friend and all that, but he still had in his mind to convince himself that I was who Mr. Michaux was saying.  But after he found out my history and such and such--so, I have met all kinds of people would come in there.
Speaker 2: Now tell me about what, what kind of a person was Langston Hughes and may--maybe you can describe J. A. Rogers--
Speaker 1: Well, well, well, Langston Hughes was--you know Langston of course been a collector early, 'cause my father had his books and I have his books in the store.  I, I knew who he was.  We would have some of Langston's book in our schools, so I knew who he was, I but never thought I would meet him.  But the mere fact, he was a friendly person.  He--you know, it's--you know, this enthusiasm radiated from him.  If, if he knew that you were into our history and all that, you know, he was a, a warm person.  As a matter fact, I, I'm going back.  When I went overseas, it took me nineteen days to go from Seattle, Washington, where we left from, to go over to Japan--I mean over to Korea.  On the boat I volunteered for the KP [Kitchen Patrol], which is something that's un--unheard of.  If you ever been the service you don't volunteer for KP, but I did it for a reason.  I got, I got up at, at 4:00 in the morning to peel potatoes, wash pots and that, but I would have the rest of the time free on the ship.  But I'd brought three books with me: Ayn Rand, "The Fountainhead" and "Atlas Shrugged", and I brought Langston Hughes autobiography, "The Big C."  And by the time I reached Korea, I had read all three of those.  But just to show you I was so enthusiastic with, with Malcolm [sic. Langston] when I met him, you know, how he described his adventures traveling around the world on these various merchant marines and different ports and you know, as a young person, and when he went to Haiti, how he described the Citadel and all that, and that became a part of me.  But I didn't know at the time I would later meet this man, ma--Malcolm--I mean Langston Hughes.
Story_ID: 71371
Speaker 1: What about J. A. Rogers?  Now he's, he's less well known and not as celebrated, but he, he was a tremendous figure--(unclear).
Speaker 2: Joel A. Rogers, as I said, he was like--meeting--he was, he was like meeting a, a, a, a--what's it, the garill--garrill--gar--the--he was a--
Speaker 1: Griot
Speaker 2: Griot a Griot--I'm sorry--a Griot, you know.  He was like a prophet in the sense of history, you know, because I've read so much about him.  He was an elderly man, was tall, sort of light skin with glasses, you know.  And matter of fact, after I was talking to him, it was like I was in another world, but I was polite and listening to him.  I asked him to sign a book.  Mr. [Lewis] Michaux sold out of it.  I didn't have his copy.  I had, I had his books at home, but they wasn't--Mr. Michaux didn't have any other books by him in the books--in the store at the time.  So I had in my hand--I bought about four or five books.  One book I do remember, my former rival, Jim Brown, his book, his first, book off "Off My Chest."  I said Mr. Rogers, would you--I don't have it.  I said "would you please sign this?  He said, "I don't make it a practice of signing other people's books, but since you're a collector, I will sign this book."  And I still have that book today by Rogers all--the life of Jim Brown "Off My Chest," signed by Joel A. Rogers.  Then later on, I had a chance, I had a chance to go by his house.  I just forgot--he did--didn't, didn't live that far away from--so I went by there.  I went up the flight of steps.  He said he had a copy of "100 Amazing Facts About the Negro."  (Unclear)--(unclear) he just had someone reprinted it.  He print--he published his own books because, you know, the publishers didn't.  But now his stories are going back.  They used Mr. Rogers' work over the years, but they didn't give the credit--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --things they criticized him for.  The one thing I liked about him, Mr. Rogers, he documented everything.  He told you where--if you didn't believe him, you can go and, and, and search these books out.  And the mere fact is that he spent his time, his life, his own money out of his own pockets.  You know, I met other people like Ms. Nellie Bright, who was a good friend of Jessie Fauset here in Philly--Philadelphia.  She used to tell me when she was in her eighties she was a, she was a secretary to the Black Opals.  She knew Dr. Alain Locke and Jessie Fauset and all them because they were part of the--what they called the Black Opals.  It's, it's sort of a, a subgroup of the Harlem Renaissance.  And she would tell me how much that Rogers and Jessie Fauset would go to, to the, the Luxemburg Garden and Palace, you know, with--during their lunch and read books at the Sorbonne and so forth.  Mr. Rogers would always go to the section in German, and French, and books written in Ethiopian.  He did something that we need to do today.  We need to send scholars into the archives throughout the world and to see what is in there about our history because this is what I admired him about: He didn't have a grant; no one sponsored him; he did it because he loved his history, and this is what I learned from him.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--did you have any sense of how he financed his trips?
Speaker 2: Well, he fi--
Speaker 1: He did go all over the world.  I know at one time as a Pullman--
Speaker 2: A Pullman porter--
Speaker 1: --porter.
Speaker 2: A Pullman porter.
Speaker 1: He went to every library in every city.
Speaker 2: Every library when, when he was a Pullman porter, plus he, he worked for Haile Selassie one time in Ethiopia, you know, during--then he was involved with the Spanish Civil War.  He was writing for the "Pittsburgh Courier."  He never had that much money, but through writing and selling--writing, and publishing, and selling, and, and working these odd jobs, he was able to--it's, it's, it's staggering what this man did.  It's staggering today to see what he accomplished with his work, you know.  We have people in other places who were, what I say, are taking advantage in some of these Ivy League universities--I won't mention any names--who have these big grants and putting their names all, all over everything.  But Mr. Rogers, people like him, Mr. Michaux, and Dr. John Henrik and others, these--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--John Jackson.
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: John Jackson's another person.  I can name all of them over and over.
Story_ID: 71372
Speaker 1: All those people are mentioned in my books, you know, because they provided--being a black bibliophile or a collection--bibliophile means a lover of books--you know, there have been people even back in the 17--mid 1700s who preserve--like Abby Brigar, who taught Alexandre Dumas, who, I have the original book that he wrote, you know, who set aside time to collect the works of black people.  I mean, there have been collectors of African culture even during the time of the, of the, the, the great Songhai Empire in Africa.  There was always people who preserved our history, Schomburg, myself, and Adger, and, and Carl Bolivar, and, and Henry Slaughter, and, and later people like Joel Spingarn, who was of a Jewish descent, and other people like that, Jessie Morning.  We are this part of the spokes of the wheel, you know.  When I pass on to others--I have encouraged a lot of people, young people and others to collect today.  I guess people call me--some people call me the second Schomburg, which is a heavy title, but you know, it's a title that I respect.  But, there again, I always tried to encourage other collectors, and they call from all over to continue to collect.  Something that's happening now in this phase: During the '60s [1960s], there was a great interest in black culture, and it's coming back again.  Every fifteen or twenty years or more it sort of regurgitate and--but there is another phenomenon today that has sort of obsessed me in a way, the state of auction houses.  You know, there's a lot of people today who are buying books who are, who are making good money off of it.  It reminds me of the slave auction.  I mean, books that people like Joel A. Rogers and, and [Arthur] Schomburg and others at one time found it difficult to attain money out of their own pocket.  And at the time there was books by [Paul Laurence] Dunbar, Charles Chestnut, Zora Neale Hurston lying around.  No one cared.  But now they're commanding top prices.  It's, it's was painful for me as an African American to buy back my history; you know, it's painful for, painful for me to go to an auction, you know, for an item I want.  To bid on a, on an item is like bidding on our ancestors again, you know.  And some people are taking advantage of it and raising the prices.
Speaker 2: And commercializing--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Commercialization, instead of--my thing always has been, always, even when I was in--involved with the Underground Railroad, preserving that--my thing is commemoration and not commercialization.
Story_ID: 71373
Speaker 1: Now, now how did you get--now let's get to how you really started your career.  You, you said that you were contacted by the, the board of education or the city of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: No, the cit-Norristown [Pennsylvania], Norris--
Speaker 1: In Norristown.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Norristown School District--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, who was having some difficulties of--was in the--was, was the black--African-American community of integrating the elementary school.  Although, though I said earlier that we always had--we were always integrated as early as 18--1880.  Norristown always a black community in our--1883--the, the black community was one of the first communities in the country, in the North, in Norristown, to, to apply for integration of schools.  So therefore we had that, but we didn't have forty into, into the elementary school.  When they moved some of the elementary schools out in the suburbs, you know, this was when the trouble start, because they wanted the bus--the African-American children into the area, but didn't want any of the white children to come into the black community.  So in high school there was a lot of controversy.  And when they built a new high school the same thing happened.  So they asked me to come there to help them with the community, and title was advisory specialist in, in human relation and cultural affairs.  My task was to organize, you know, black history programs, to, to, to recommend books, to interview African-American teachers that went to an all--went to quite a few colleges, black universities and colleges, and other colleges to recruit African-American teachers.  One thing I instrumented was a, a tour.  I recommended that, that the school district, district every year before school start have a bus tour of the, of the, of the, of the community of Norristown, where I can acquaint the new teachers, new employees with the history, where people lived and such, and such, and such.  Then I also formed the black educators with a group of teachers in the school districts to help students with scholarships and whatever, to encourage them to bring their problems, whatever.

Speaker 1: Back in 1979 when I received my first honorary degree from Villanova University.  My mother's standing the middle next to me.
Speaker 2: Her name.
Speaker 1: Annie, Annie Parker Blockson, my mother.  And on the, on the left standing next to Father Driscoll, who was the president of the University of Villanova at the time.  On the left is my longtime high school friend, Robert J. Butera.  And on my, on my left standing next to me is Edith Moore.  Edith Moore is the wife of Lenny Moore.  Lenny is standing next to his wife Edith.  This was taken at Villanova University, 1979.
Speaker 2: Moore is spelled M-O-O-R-E?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: That picture--this picture was taken in my, in my den in my home back in 19--the early '70s [1970s], 1972, '73 [1973].  It shows some of my athletic pictures and African American.  In my hand I'm holding a copy of the "The Liberator," the famous anti-slavery newspaper started by William Lloyd Garrison.
Speaker 1: This picture is, is, is the bust that's, that's done of me.  One of the busts is in the hallway.  This is a bronze bust done by the famous sculptor, Antonio Salemme--Salemme, S-A-L-E-M-M-E.  He was ninety-eight years old at the time.  He did the first bust of Paul Robeson, the, the, the, the nude bust, the large nude bust of Paul Robeson, 1927, when he was--had his studio in Greenwich Village, New York.  He also did the famous bust of Robeson.  And he did one of Ethel Waters and John F. Kennedy, Fannie Hurst, and President Eisenhower.  Paul Robeson was the first African-American bust that he did back in 19--mid '20s [1920s], and I was the last African American.  Tony Salemme died at the age of 102.  He was ninety-eight years old when he, as I said, for thirty-five times traveled from my hometown in Gwinnett, Pennsylvania, outside of Philadelphia to Easton, which is about forty miles away, for thirty-five times he took it.
Speaker 2: And the bust resides here at Temple?
Speaker 1: I, I have a copy here, in which is in--at Temple, I have one in my home, and he--his wife has a copy and it's (unclear) the studio.
Speaker 2: This is a studio.  It was taken back in the 8--early--mid '80's [1980s].  (Unclear) around 1986, '87 [1987]--Operation Crossroads.  It was formulated by, by William Gray, Bill Gray was the former congressman from Philadelphia (unclear) Appropriation Committee.  Him and a group of Jewish officials came up with the idea and they called it Operation Crossroads, where a group of Jewish children and African-American children would meet once a year to go to Senegal and, and Israel, you know, to foster interface or in a group relationships.  So, before they left on their trip, I spoke to them.  They would come here, where I would speak to them.  It's called Operation Crossroads.  Okay.
Speaker 1: This photograph was taken with my daughter, Noelle, N-O-E-L-L-E, when she was five years old in, in my home in my library in 9--in the 9, in the 19--1972, '73 [1973].  She's my only daughter, so it's a picture.  And she has been--if you wanna show this, 'cause this--'cause it's clear?
Speaker 2: This is Tony again.  Here's his picture--there again, is another view of the sculptor being, being present, being presented in 1997 here at Penn--I mean at the Temple University--was a, a sculptor, Antonio Salemme, his wife, Martha Salemme, and my daughter Noelle Blockson.
Speaker 1: And what age would she be at about this time?
Speaker 2: Thirty-five.
Story_ID: 71375
Speaker 1: Oh, that photograph was made at my home.  I live out in the suburbs.  It's like, that's one of my drums.  I have a lot of African sculptors, another large collection I have of African sculptor, which I started collecting over thirty-five years ago.  So I more or less played around with the drum.
Speaker 2: I thought this, this was an, an Egyptian thing when I first saw it.
Speaker 1: Oh no, this, this is, this is when I'm, I'm posing for the Robeson statue in a Tony Salemme--well, I guess when he gets finished.
Speaker 2: What--I'm sorry--did we say what year this was?
Speaker 1: It's 1980's, '86 [1986].
Speaker 2: I'm posing in, in Antonio Salemme studio, his studio in Eastern Pennsylvania.  Antonio Salemme, as we said earlier, he did the bust of Robeson.  In 19--1926, he did a nude statute of Paul Robeson, and it was refused here in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  It was refused in Chicago [Illinois], the showing of it, but went to San Francisco [California] that we won awards, and later went to Paris [France].  The, the sculptor, nude sculptor, was lost in Paris and has never been found.  Antonio Salemme took shoe polish and painted it black.  And when, when the Nazi came during the war, you know, it's, it's lost even today.  He had one other replica of it.  He had a replica of it, but that, that was also lost.  But then one day Paul, Jr. came by his home in around 1891, '92 [1892] and, and they were talking.  The only thing he had of, of the sculptor was some pictures that Carl Van Vechten took of, of Robeson.  When Carl Van Vechten would come by Tony Salemme and Ethel Waters would come by and the [W.E.B.] DuBois, James Weldon Johnson would come by and review the new statue, everybody raved about it.  But since it was lost, he just had the picture.  So he told me to take my shirts--'cause you, you and Paul's the same height and so forth.  And he said--I said well, Tony my playing days are over.  I don't have the same body.  But he said (unclear), please, you know.  So, he's taking my muscle tones, and this is, this is why--it's ironic, here I pe--posed for the same sculptor that did Robeson's bust and his nude statue.  And he did a bust of me, so that was sort historic there.
Speaker 1: This picture was--is, is, is a group of us distinguished alumni from the Penn State University [State College, Pennsylvania].  We, we, we, we they called us together.  Franco Harris, the great football player, was supposed to be in the picture, but he was away.  He was late getting to the appointment.  He was, he was there that day too.  In the picture, there's Herb Nipson.
Speaker 2: How about go from left to right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, (unclear)--some I, I still re--standing backwards from me on my left-hand side is Herb Nipson.  Herb Nipson is very important with "Ebony" magazine.  He as there for years and when the editor was John Johnson.  He was at Penn State [University] or from Clearfield, Pennsylvania, which is about thirty miles from Penn State [University].  And some of the others: I can see Ron Davenport on the far end.  Ron Davenport owns the huge radio station, media station, today--quite wealthy.  And--
Speaker 2: Is he on the far right or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, on the far right, with the glasses, that right there.  And then some of the others--when Benton Dudson (ph.) and a couple of the others, Mrs. Settel (ph.)--Mrs.--her name is Settel.  I forgot her first name.  I don't have their names.  Then Ms. Anderson is number--what's his first name--no, over here, up here.
Speaker 2: Here?
Speaker 1: Yeah, right here, the last, right here.
Speaker 2: Oh, this one on the far left?
Speaker 1: Right, yeah, now what's his first name?  Anderson is his last name, from (unclear), the same with Billy Ja--but I, I don't have their names right.  Is it--it's not on the back of the book--pay--picture is it?  That, right there.  I have another at home.  It could be under--oh, man, it's on the other at home.  I don't have them all.
Speaker 2: And where are you all standing at?
Speaker 1: We're standing in, in at Old Main, the main, the main building in Pennsylvania State, Old Main it's called, the main administration building, you know, in, in the lobby there; that's Penn State University.  This is also in the '80s [1980s] to 1983, '80--bout, bout '86[1986].
Speaker 2: This is at Penn State against a meet against Michigan University in 1955 against and, and--against the University of Michigan, a track meet and I'm about to throw the discus.
Speaker 1: This is Barbara Chase-Riboud, the famous sculptor and writer.  She did the book, "Sally Hemmings."  She's from Philadelphia.  And we were being honored here in Philadelphia in, in, in mid 1990--'94 [1994], you know, her and I with the Brandy White Art Workshop, which is a cultural group honoring artists and writers and so forth.  So Barbara and I was chosen as a recipient of the award.
Speaker 2: Okay that photo was taken at Valley Forge [Pennsylvania], where I was instrumental with the, the sorority sisters, Delta Sigma--Sigma Theta.  We erected a monument at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, which is about twenty-five miles here from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]  and is about seven miles, miles from my hometown.  It's where--it's the first monument ever to honor the black patriots at Valley Forge, where, where I, I have inscription on the back of the monument whereas my name is on there.  So people come from all over, so this is a group of people from Buffalo, New York, who was passing through and explained the marker to the, the monument to them.
Speaker 1: This is--I was in charge of the Pennsylvania State African American Marker Program.  But I was a member of the Pennsylvania Black History Committee.  Here, we're in honoring Edward Ned Hector, the African-American hero, at the Battle of Brandywine, who said--this is back in 1975--'76 [1976].  It's to honor--it's the first state marker honoring the African American Revolutionary War solder.  His name was Edward Hector.
Speaker 2: Do you happen to know who's looking at the photograph?
Speaker 1: That's Mrs. Elizabeth Harry.  She's from Country Hawkin--Elizabeth Harry--Harry, H-A-R-R-Y.
Speaker 2: This photograph is Marian [Anderson] at her home in Danville, Connecticut, in, in 1996.  And then on the, on the left-hand side is, is Fran--Frank Stevens.  Frank Stevens and I--he was, he was a designer for the Free Library of Philadelphia.  And we mounted a large exhibition honoring Marian Anderson.  And we went to her home in Dansbury to entice her to come to Philadelphia to see the exhibit, which she did.  And it was taken a year before she died.
Speaker 1: Stevens, S-T-E-V-E-N-S.
Speaker 2: Yes, Frank.
Speaker 1: This, this was taken I was in, in, in Paris at the, the, the, the African American Writer's Conference in Paris, France, in ni--in ni--in 1992.  It was an international conference where I served as a moderator and participated in a panelist.
Speaker 2: And you--can you describe anyone else in the photograph?
Speaker 1: These are, these are just people, you know, were part of the group.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry--what year was this again.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--1992.
Speaker 2: Oh, that--okay.  This picture was taken in the 1970s, one of my favorite.  People all sort of liked it.  It was my pipe and all that.  I, I smoke a pipe, and it's like it's a pacifier, but it's been used several times.
Speaker 1: It's on the website; it's on the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry--what year?
Speaker 2: The '70s [1970s], when--let's see--(unclear)--my mind--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--no, late se--'78 [1978], '79 [1979].
Speaker 1: This is, this is in the early '90s [1990s], 1991--a picture of--someone, someone came to interview me, so they told me just--this is in my office--just to go through some of the books.  I forgot, I forgot who came in, a television station, whatever--just told me to page through my books.  On, on the top you'll see a bust of Jean-Jacques Dessalines and Andre--and Toussaint Louverture on the bar--the bust, the leaders of Haiti, those two busts.  Oh, is, is there a bust on the, on the desk too?  I can't see it from here.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, and the other bust on, on the table is a bust of Christophe, Henri Christophe.  (Unclear)--the, the ceremony--I mean these--(unclear)--(unclear)--memor--they had a big thing in New York for him.
Speaker 2: Okay, this me and the great international artist, Romare Bearden in 1987.  When he was in Philadelphia, we had one taken and also had one was taken with Vander Zee at the same period.  Both of them were here together.  This Romare Bearden, the great African-American artist, abstract artist, whatever.
Speaker 1: Can you spell his name?
Speaker 2: B-E-A-R-D-E-N, isn't it--Bearden--B--B-R--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: Romare, R-O-M-A-R-E.
Speaker 2: Right.  I can't even spell the--it's on the back of the picture I think.
Speaker 1: This is taken at the Free Library of Philadelphia.  The occasion was odd--honoring Dr. John Henrik Clarke, the great African-American historian.  Just at the final stage of his blindness and here I'm adjusting the mark--the, the mic for him.  I introduced him to the audience.  This was--it was ni--around 1996.
Speaker 2: This photo was taken in front of the former home of James Forten, the--who was a great leader of the--Afri--free African-American community during the, the revolution.  He, he participated in the Revolutionary War as a young boy and later invented a contraption to make the sailboats sail faster and became a very wealth--wealthy person, employing both bla--blacks and whites.  And he contribute to the Abolitionist Movement.  He gave back to his community.  He supported William Lloyd Garrison's newspaper, "The Liberator."  Many distinguished persons, African and others, came to his home.  James Forten and his, his famous--his Charlotte, Charlotte Forten, his granddaughter also distinguished herself in literature and writing and such.  The, the whole Forten family were abolitionists in literature and art, and such and such.
Speaker 1: And you're unveiling a plaque at--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: A plaque at his former site--the site of his former home.  It's, it's our first marker.  I was in charge of the, the Philadelphia State Histo--Historical Marker Program--Pennsylvania State Historical Marker Program honoring African Americans.  And we placed sixty six markers in the city of Philadelphia.  And also, Philadelphia--as a result of this, Philadel--Philadelphia has become the leading city for, for tourism for African-American history in the country.
Speaker 1: This was taken in 1992 when I was in, in Egypt--'94 [1994]--excuse me--when I was in Egypt, was a group of Egyptian children in a village.
Speaker 2: Was that in Cairo or Aswan?
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is down, down--there going down, outside of--it's in between Cairo--
Speaker 2: Luxor?
Speaker 1: Luxor, in that area, just a little below Luxor.
Speaker 2: Is this on the same trip?
Speaker 1: No, this is different.
Speaker 2: This is, this is me in Paris.  It was 19--1994, '94 [1994]--I think in 1994 at the famous Shakespeare--in, in front of the famous Shakespeare and Company bookstore in Paris, you know, right along, right along the Seine--not too far from Notre Dame.  I'm at a bookstore there, where a lot of prominent scholars--like, like Richard Wright would come there.  The guy who, who still owns the--who owns the bookstore is American.  He was there.  He was a good friend of Richard Wright.  He's, he's up in age now, but he was inside that day.  And I stopped there to buy several books, which I always do when I go to Paris.  So I bought some books, and I'm standing outside the bookshop, the Shakespeare and Company books it's called.
Speaker 1: This is, this is my daughter, Noelle, but she spells it N-O-E-L-L-E.  This is during the dedication of the, the bust at the, at the President's Lounge upstairs in this building when Antonio Salemme did the bust of me.  Well, we had the dedication here.
Speaker 2: Oh, this was a photo taken at random when I was in the sixth grade and in grade school.
Speaker 1: So you would have been approximately how old?
Speaker 2: What was--we go to school--what age you go to school?--about twelve years old--eleven, twelve --sixth.  Yes, eleven, twelve, sixth-- eleven.
Speaker 1: That's 1944?
Speaker 2: It's in there, yeah.  Yeah, that's when it was.
Speaker 1: This is when I was in the--this is, this is when I was in--it's around the same time.  The other one I didn't have my clothes on.  This was in the fourth grade, my fourth grade photograph in Gotwal's grade school.
Speaker 2: This, this is my sophomore year at Penn State.  We had a photographer day.  This is me running the ball as a fullback in 1953--'54 [1954] rather--I'm sorry--'54 [1954].
Speaker 1: This is, is, is my senior year at Penn State in, in practice.  It's, it's, it's--throwing a discus in 1956--is a practice field.
Speaker 2: Is this in high school.
Speaker 1: No, that's college.  That's against Fordham [University].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Fifty-four [1954], was snowing that day.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it snows in Iowa.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we--yeah we had a--we, we were late for our own game.  We were out of town and sitting in the next town.  We couldn't get there.  They were--they, they had to delay the game.
Speaker 2: Is this you rushing?
Speaker 1: Yeah, (unclear)--1954 against Fordham University [New York, New York].  Yeah, we were late for our own game.
Speaker 2: 'Cause of the snow.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the snow.
Speaker 2: This is--oh, yeah, what year?--1990--in '95 [1995], '95 [1995]--in '95  [1995] with Bishop Tutu when he came here at Temple.  I was meeting--this is Bishop Tutu of South Africa.  This is Desmond, Desmond, Desmond Tutu.
Speaker 1: This is a--this is the--when I was on assignment for the "National Geographic" article, I was (unclear) on doing the first cover story on the Underground Railroad, 19--July of 1984, where I toured the country.  And then I had suggested to them to employ my friend, Jerry Pinkney, the well-known children illustrator.  Jerry's from Philadelphia.  So, I described what I wanted on the cover, and Jerry, and Jerry did it, so the cover became the first true African American positive story of African American.  And also the editor was so pleased with the assignment, so he assigned to me.  So I went over--that laid the foundation for my work for the National Park Service, this article.
Speaker 2: And that's the cover by Jerry Pinkney.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the cover's by Jerry.  I told Jerry what I wanted.  Him
Speaker 2: He was so good.  He was--
Speaker 1: Him and his editors and his two sons, and his--Bryan and his daughter, his wife, Gloria, is a good writer, and their good friends.  As I'm saying today, there's so many people that, that I came across through, through what I'm doing.  And some collected it--collect-- just hoarding their books and keep 'em to themselves.  What I try to do with my collection, I try to disseminate with history, with art, and all that, you know.  Rosa Parks sat in the same chair over there.  I mean all kinds of people have been here, Alice Walker, tons of people, Toni Morrison, Henry Louis--Henny Louis, Skip Gates.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my li--lifelong hero, Paul Robeson, who I was one of the few people in the world to, to see him.  I saw him three times.  When he lived here in Philadelphia, I saw him about five min--months--the last time I saw him was December of--December the 17th, the day after my birthday, at his home in West Philadelphia in 1975.  He died in January 23rd, 1976.  But Robeson has always been an inspiration to me.  I have several things he signed to me, whatever, and I keep his pictures and things around me all the time in, in this--my office or wherever, my home, wherever.  And I've written a lot of things about him, gave a lot of exhibitions of his wife and whatever.  That's it.
Story_ID: 66164
Speaker 1: And you're starting your career as a consultant for Norristown [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But as I said before, I, I, I--the things I organized there and all, like the, the black educators group of teacher and associates to help the students, to help the library, and make sure that the library is--all the schools had African-American books, to--and to recruit African-American teachers for this district, to, to talk to community and, and, and to show them that, you know, give them the history of the community that we did get together and such and such and such.  And then the last thing I did was, was to organize students for assignments.  And I had to go into the community and to learn about the community. And that was about for nine years or so.
Speaker 1: Would you have them do oral history?
Speaker 2: Oh, oral history, the oral history of--whether they Italian, whether they were Irish, German, or Scandinavian, or black or whatever, just to give them a background of their history.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, now what, what--when did you start doing this full time, 'cause you had a janitorial service?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean I did some of it even when I had a jan--I did part time, three days a week.  But they said well, if I could, so I gave up my business and I did pick--I went full time with them.
Speaker 1: With the board of education--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in Norristown?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 66165
Speaker 1: Now when did you first book come out?
Speaker 2: My first book was "Pennsylvania's Black History," 1975.  I wanted to do it in conjunction with the, the bicentennial 1976.  When I toured the--when the travels of the sixty-seven counties in Pennsylvania, and I wanted to just give a, a thumbnail sketch of what happened.  It wasn't a scholarly per, per se, but scholars use it.  But I wanted a book for the, the everyday person who would read the books, school children, lay people, whatever could read it, were to say--bring out some of the, the great people, such as Martin Delaney, who wor--who wasn't born in Pennsylvania, but is born--but he grew up in Chambersburg [Pennsylvania], but he had influence here in the city of Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] , and others.  And of course Frederick Douglass came to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and Harriet Tubman, and Richard Allen (unclear).  Philadelphia was a--had the largest free African-American community in the country, so other cities sort of modeled after Philadelphia; it was New York [New York], Baltimore [Maryland], whatever.  So--
Speaker 1: And, and, and let me just point out as the, as the, the site of the first major convention of black men in the--
Speaker 2: In 1830, they, they held the first colored convention, the Convention of Colored People 1830 at Mother Bethel Church, a church founded by Richard Allen, Reverend Richard Allen, which is still located in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  It's the oldest piece of property continuously, continuously own by African Americans in this country.  It was Richard Allen bought a blacksmith shop and on this site he built Mother--the Bethel--the, the African Episcopal Methodist Church commonly called Mother Bethel.  People come from all over the world to see this site.  He's buried there today.  The, the third church was a site--the second and the third church was an important site in the Underground Railroad.  The--this last church, the fourth church, was built in 1889, which is standing today.
Speaker 1: What--why did a, a lot of the early black communities name there institution African this and African that?
Speaker 2: They were proud of their African.  You know, it didn't take--not--it's nothing against Jesse Jackson--it didn't take Jesse Jackson to call ourselves Africans to be African-American.  Our ancestors were proud to call themselves African, like the Free African Society founded in 1787, which was the first beneficial society to help the poor and such and to free African this--African this, African this, whatever.  But we're also called many names.  Throughout our history we were called many names.  When we were first brought here, we were called Guineas, you know, from the, the Guinea Coast, the early, the early slave books--books on slavery you'll say Guineas or--arrived today on the such and such ship--shipment loads of Guineas from the West Coast of Africa, you know.  So Guinea--you'll find Guinea Hill, Guinea Town, Guinea Run.  And we were called men and--men and women of color, colored Americans, you know, African American, Afro-American, so--Negro.  So the names have changed over the years, but probably African--going back to your question--our ancestors, even under the yolk of slavery, were proud of their African ancestors.  Not all of them had Christian names.  Some of them kept their mother--ma, ma, ma--Muslim name--I mean names because that they required and from the Moorish names or whatever, so.
Story_ID: 66166
Speaker 1: Now were some--where did your--I guess, what were some of the high--highlights of your research I guess, like I say, if we need to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, my, well, my research, being a collector, I mean, people call me from a lot of different--'cause when people call, reporters, television, media people, people from all over, I never know who's gonna call on the telephone, who's gonna write me, so I have--I'm one of the bibliophiles like [Arthur] Schomburg.  I, I read my books.  I mean I've dealt--developed--a sort of a photographic mind for books.  People say how do you remember so much of this?  They call this and all that, but you have to read, and that I know.  So one of my interests, of course, is the Underground Railroad, on which I was, you know, with the "National Geographic" article, plus I was appointed by Congress to head the National Park Service Underground Railroad study back in 1990, which all started from my work.  Plus I did the book on genealogy, Pennsylvania history, the life of Paul Robeson.  These are some of the, the marker program, preservation, the Committee of Preservation.  These are some of the things I specialized in.
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about the Underground Railroad.  Can you talk about how it was organized?  I think it was organized, kind of pat--patterned after--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The Underground Railroad--no one really officially knows when the Underground Railroads was organized.  Because when our ancestors were brought over here on these shores in slaves--as a slave person--they, they attempted self-liberation, I like to call it.  They didn't wait for other people to entice them to study, to escape.  They did--to attest to this, check out the early slave ad--advertisements in the 1700s.  As far back as the 1701, '02 [1702], and '03 [1703] in Pennsylvania, New York and all over all, you'll see where people advertised certain individual advertiser that their enslaved African ran away on this day and such and such.  So that was a part of the Underground Railroad.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Crispus Attucks was one.
Speaker 2: He was, he was a runaway enslaved African.  Crispus Attucks, he was, as we know, was the first person to give his life from freedom and so forth.  So what I'm saying to you, we have to be careful.  We don't know when it first started, but as soon as our ancestors had a chance, they, they, they ran away.  The Underground Railroad, as I said on the "National Geographic" article, it wasn't formally organized until the 1830s and so forth and primarily by African people themselves.  There were other people, such as the Quakers.  The Quakers have received a lot of credit over the years, but not all the Quakers, only a small group of Quakers, such as Lucretia Mott, Thomas Garrett and others.  But there were also other people involved, mostly the free African community and the enslaved, then you had the Unitarians, you have the (unclear), you have--you had Native Americans.  We came (unclear) Pontiac in Michigan, you know, was involved.  And you got people down in--with the Seminole people down--Seminole Nation down in Florida, who welcomed our people.  We had the Mexican government, who welcomed our people in Texas.  All the branches of the Underground Railroad didn't head north; some went to Mexico; some went to the Caribbean; some went to the Everglades.  So, what I'm saying, the Underground--we don't know how many people escaped on the Underground--our people, because it was clandestine.  But primarily it was a secret network, you know, filled with many different spurs of, of, of, of escape routes, you know.  Anyone with escape route could, could change.  Pennsylvania played a very important part, because along the East Coast you had the free African--the largest free African-American community. If more nationally known slave cases or events happened--Henry Box Brown came here.  William and Ellen Craft came from Macon, Georgia here.
Speaker 1: You know, Jane Johnson, who was involved with the "Wheeler" case in the 1850s.
Speaker 2: Just--
Speaker 1: Jane Johnson the same--Johnson with this narratives recently advertised not discovered by Dr. Henry Louis Gates.  The same person who owned Hannah Craft's so-called--who owned Hannah Craft also owned Jane Johnson.  Jane Johnson is written and published--her, her case is published in William Steele's books in 1872.  William Steele book--William Steele was African American, as we know, from Burlington County, New Jersey, came to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], worked in the anti-slavery office, record where people came from.
Story_ID: 66167
Speaker 1: Another--going back to your question when I first--my interest started, my interest started in the Underground Railroad primarily-- although I, I read it, bits about it in school--one day my grandfather was singing in our backyard, him and my grandmother, who came from Farmville, Virginia.  My grandmother came to Norristown.  They met when my grandfather came up--first came to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] from Delaware, came to Norristown [Pennsylvania], and they married.  And they had my--as I said, they had two children, my, my uncle, David, who's passed, my father.  Then one day they started a church.  They were founding mem--members of the Salong Baptist Church.  And he was a religious person who says, you know, he worked hard on, on the state hospital farm, the first African American who worked there as a teamster.  And--but he belonged--he was mason and all, an odd fellow.  He belonged to the John Brown Club.  They honored the great John Brown.  They had a club, you know, where they would,  where the, the group every year would go up to Lake Placid, New York--near Lake Placid, North Elba, right next to Lake Placid, where John Brown is buried.  So one day he was singing a song, a spiritual, there's a highway to heaven, there's a highway to heaven walking up the king's highway.  I said grandpa, what are singing about.  I was ten years old.  And we had just finished our dinner, sitting outside on the crate boxes.  He got happy.  When his soul became happy he would sing.  So he said I was singing about the Underground Railroad.  He say's my father, James, your great-grandfather, escaped on the Underground Railroad from Seifert, Delaware, came to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and made his way to Canada, you know.  And then two years later, his cousin, Jacob Blockson, escaped, came to Philadelphia and met with--you know, he didn't tell me at the time William Steele went through Canada.  So then that piqued my interest, so I let it go for about four or five years.  The interest was here and there, playing sports and all the other.  So one day I came across a book at Leary's Book Store.  Leary's Book Store, people from all over the world would come to on 9th and Marcus Street.
Speaker 2: How do you spell his--
Speaker 1: L-E-A-R-Y, Leary Book Store--people from all over, all the book people.  They would have books outside enticing people to come in.  One sign said Hurt Books.  Now, Hurt Books, Leary meant damaged books.  And he had this big book (unclear)--five dollars.  And back in 19--what--five years later, I was in junior high school.  Well, I guess it--that was a lot of money, five dollars.  (Unclear)--like (unclear)--I said Underground Railroad.  Something said go up there and look.  I looked through the first page.  I opened the book up, page 488. My--I started to shake, and it said escaped in 1858 from se--Sussex County, Sei--Seifert Sussex County, Delaware.  Jacob Blockson, George Allen Goode, and two other people, his brother, you know.  And I, and I looked at it and kept reading, and I started shaking.  Then Jacob described to William Steele--after he came here, he told William Steele after he came from Delaware, he escaped originally with Harriet Tubman, but they got mis--they took another route.  There--they, they left with Harriet Tubman--
Speaker 2: They got separated?
Speaker 1: They got separated--left with Harriet Tubman, and they got separated and came in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Dela-Wilmington, Delaware.  Anyhow, came to William Steele, and  he told William Steele to write a letter to his wife, Leah, and, and his son, Alexander, to say that when he get to Canada, he would write back through Steele to tell him that where they were.  Sure enough, he wrote back.  In the book is his letter to William Steele saying that he's safe and Canada West--Canada West, which, which is today we call St. Catherine, Canada.  That's where Harriet Tubman had her home in Canada, has her church.  I was up there several times.  It's like--this is long before.  Then I said well, I never knew until I read the book that I was associated with the great William Steele.  I'm still part of the Steele (unclear) family reunion.  They just had their 134th annual reunion.  And it's like--and then I was, my relatives' escape was Harriet Tubman, because Seifert, Delaware and Bucktown, Maryland, where Harriet Tubman is bur--was grew up as--before I started my Underground Railroad article--when I wrote the [National] Geographic, I started down where she was buried.  So in other words, that's when my Underground Railroad--I had other relative who--and went through Canada, which is right across from Detroit.  There are some still there and other parts.  I had people, relatives, when I spoke in Nova Scotia.  I just missed the last person who just died about eight years ago--yeah, about eight years ago.  I just missed the last relative in Nova Scotia, so my whole family was a part of it.  They, they could not stand the yolk of slavery, even down in where Harriet Tubman grew up and where they grew up it was agriculture, farms, strawberries picking.  You know, it wasn't the Deep South slavery, but it was a still a slave.  So that's a part of my spirit also, not to be confined, so--and to know later on about the Underground Railroad and that I was a part of it, then to know that I was--my family connected with two of the greatest heroes, with William Steele and Harriet Tubman, you know.
Story_ID: 66168
Speaker 1: So then from that, as I said, flunking English Composition twice in college and all the other (unclear), here I later write not one story, but I wrote two stories for the "National Geographic."  The one was on the Sea Islands.  It was called "Sea Change in the Sea Islands" of the Gullah speaking peoples of the South Carolina and Georgia.  They had me come down there and do that.  So, then later on, I never in my wildest dreams think that was--think that the, the United States government, when the whole idea of the, the (unclear) of the Underground Railroad started here in Pennsylvania when Senator Peter J. Kostmayer of Pennsylvania read my Underground Railroad book "The Underground Railroad--Railroad in Pennsylvania" and "National Geographic" article.  He said Charles, he said, I'm a part of the Department of Interior, part of Congress.  He said, I read your books and your, your Underground Railroad articles, he said, was fascinated by it.  He said what do you think of preserving--is, is it possible to preserve the sites of the Underground--I said, congressman, by all means.  When I was traveling around the country, in the Deep South and all through the Midwest and to Canada, over to Nova Scotia and New England and all over the places, you know, sometimes I'd park my car.  I had a brand new car, the best hotels.  I wouldn't--you know, sometimes I would stay in these hotels and eat, but sometimes I would just park the car and walk in the rain and the snow.  In the Midwest I was chased in Ohio, down the Southern part of Ohio.  It's all the way down-what's the-- it's down to (unclear)--the, the other state, near, near the Kentucky--with the border--
Speaker 2: Marietta--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --(unclear) Ohio.
Speaker 1: Rip--(unclear)--Ripley.  It was (unclear) Ripley.  And a policeman came up and said to me--(unclear) went to see the John Parker House and when it was still in decay.  And, and John--Reverend John Ripley--a police came and said boy--'cause I had this new car--what are you doing in here around this area, boy?  I said I'm writing an article for "National Geographic."  He said be sure you--geographic?  He said what is that?  I started telling him.  He said, now you be sure you get out of the air, we don't want any trouble, now you hear me?  I said yeah, but I was glad.  I was glad that I had that experience because it showed me what Harriet Tubman, my other ancestors had to go through, the pain, the humiliation and so forth.  And I came across some events like this through the way.  But out of the article, the [National] Geographic article, the national--the congressman pointed--the congressman--I had to go to Washington, Washington to testify to make sure the committee--I had to appoint--the congressman told me to appoint nine people for the committee, you know, to recommend their names.  I appointed John Flemming, Gannett (ph.) Tillery Turner, and, and Vivian Raheem from Delaware, and Barbara Hudson from Connecticut, and some other.  All those people--(unclear) three other people, Tom Battle from--
Speaker 2: Battle, yeah, from--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--from the (unclear) Spingarn.  Then and there's Dr. Robert Winks from Yale.  He came in later.  So our committee was the first--in the beginning, the park service didn't want anything to do with it.  They couldn't do anything.  They had to work for us.  We were their boss in the beginning for about--we worked from 1992--1990 to 198--'98 [1998].  I was in the office when President William--Bill Clinton signed the National Freedom Act.
Story_ID: 66169
Speaker 1: In between that time, I got, as early as 1991 or '92 [1992], I got a reply--receipt/replied/request to come to Cincinnati.  They were thinking about starting a museum down there, you know.  I still have my letters and documents.  I went down there.  At first I was with them, because they said it was supposed to be a small museum.  At first we didn't have any help at all for the park service, because we're trying to get the park service.  They said one time that they were gonna eliminate, they don't have the funds.  So we wrote strong letters.  As a chairperson, Robert Kennedy said you know, Congress said you're supposed to do this.  So finally, we got the bill passed.  All at once, when the money was appropriated, out of nowhere people came out, called themselves the national this and national that.  When we needed them, there was no one there.  So right now I have a mixed feeling about the Underground Railroad.  Deep in my soul I know my people were involved and others in it.  I'm sort of upset because it turned--it, it has become something of commercialism.  I don't--I despise anything that is commercialized with our history.  My thrust is commemoration.  We weren't paid for all those years.  You know, it wasn't about being paid, but the Underground Railroad has become tourism and people putting money in their pocket.  There should be an investigation, just like Watergate.  And I'm--it's the way I feel about it.  This is our history.  Our ancestors died in the Underground Railroad.  People were taken back.  People were killed.  People were whipped.  It's not just about a romantic situation.  Those homes--the goal of the thing was preservation.  I wanna know how many of those sites in Ohio, in Pennsylvania, in Maine, in, in, in the other part of the Midwest, in the Deep South, how many of those homes have been preserved for the--by the money that we have fought for, argued for for years.  People are getting paid now.  In the museum in Cincinnati [Ohio] right now--and I hope I'm not too wrong--far off my quote--is at one time was $80 million.  Now, it's a $110 million museum, you know--for what?  How many of those sites could be preserved with that money.  And Cincinnati [Ohio], as you know, is full of racial turmoil even to this day.  So what I'm saying to you, at first I was for the museum--I'm on record to say that--but not on this scale.  At first, it was supposed to be a small museum for the people around the (unclear).  They maneuvered through politics and had all the--most of the money through a bill--attachment to a bill concentrated on the Cincinnati museum.  So this is how I feel about the Underground, I'm torn.  I receive calls from the BBC, from all over the country about the Underground Railroad.
Speaker 2: So, so you think that this is be--kind of become a cash cow for--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: It seems--yes, it's just the way I feel.  It's to me, to me I have to be honest.  I'm an honest person.  It's--the museum is gonna be a house built on a weak foundation.  What I mean by that?  Because the original goal was commemoration.  That's my goal, not the commercialization, not the commercialization of it, because the Underground Railroad is in the fields, it's on the waters, you know, it's on the gravesites and all that.  I'm calling for an investigation, because I have to write it because I'm a chairperson.  We (unclear)--the other members that who feels like I feel, the majority that where is the money?  How many sites have been pre--preserved?  I still know sites in Ohio.  I'll be speaking in Ohio on October the 17th at the Ohio Association Underground Railroad.  Cassie Nelson asked me to come by a couple of years.  I'm going this year.  I'm the keynote speaker in Marietta.  I'm gonna bring the same subject up again.  And they are concerned too.  The William Parker House has not been pre--preserved, and we started that back in 1990.  Where is the money going, is what I wanna know?  Where is the money going, going to?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a dilemma (unclear)--
Speaker 1: How about Martin Delaney?  My, my God, he was a part of the Underground Railroad.  What, what is it to be preserve him?  I mean, even with the gravesites, the gravesites were, were involved in preservation so forth.  If his home is gone, his gravesite--I mean there should be something from what he did with the Underground Ra--his family and so forth.  He was in, in, in the beginning in the middle of it.  There's other people like Lewis Woodson, you know, who was the leader in the Underground Railroad in Pittsburgh, with John Peck and Bashaun (ph.)--father and son and so forth, so there's a lot of people.  These names, these churches, these homes, you know--
Speaker 2: John Brown.
Speaker 1: John Brown.  I mean it's, it's like--John Brown was all over, born in (unclear), Connecticut, but lived all over the place, in Akron, Ohio, and Hudson--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Ohio--
Speaker 2: The, the black John Brown--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, of course--
Speaker 2: Brown--
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, right, John Brown, but he was a part of it, all of Wilberforce [Ohio] that whole Wilberforce.  There was a, a lay of Xenia, Ohio.  There was the heart of the Underground Railroad.  And you go through that area today, what, what preservation do you see out there?  Where, where is the money?  This--these are the questions I wanna bring up.  When I'm in Ohio on October 17, I will write in your same state and I'll bring up Xenia and so forth, all these--You--we have Bishop [Daniel A.] Payne--I mean--who was instrumental here in Philadelphia in the Underground Railroad when he was bishop here at Mother Bethel Church.  You have all that.  What other story--Ohio is one of the best states to tell it, despite the work that William--Wilbur Siebert did for years, forty years of research.
Story_ID: 66170
Speaker 1: But Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York, this is the point of it, not this commercialism.  I mean I'm not deathly against--deadly against tourism.  If you're making money in tourism--from tourism--give back to the community.  It's what I say to these people here right now.  I said, yeah, you say that Philadelphia is one of the leading cities in the country for tourism, African-American tourism, and because of my historical site I put up and all that.  Where is that money going?  Now we're over the Liberty Belt--we're trying to get this Liberty Bell straight.  We're moving the Liberty Bell for a million to a new site.  And they discovered that George Washington had his eight enslaved African--or more--at the president house there.  You know, the Liberty Bell--the new site will be next to the lavatory, a latrine--the latrine where--outside the stables, right behind the president's house, where George Washington kept his slaves.  How can you separate the lib--the Liberty Bell itself was brought to America.  People don't ta--they don't tell you this in school.  It was transported to America.  It was a slave ship--transported to America on a slave ship, on a slave ship owned by a ca, ca, conglomerate of Jews, you know.  You know, they say, well, we, we shouldn't talk about slavery.  The, the one who instrumented, the--commissioned the slave--the, the Liberty Bell, it was cast in London--was a man, the father of my hometown, whose name from my hometown, Isaac Norris.  He's, he led the commission to have the Liberty Bell cast.  It was cast by a leading slave holder.  It was transported on a ship owned--a former slave ship--owned, owned by--owned, owned by people who were involved in the slave trade.  You know, then Robert Morris, who gave this mansion, the president's house, the first White House, here in the city of Philadelphia when [George] Washington was president here, he was the leading slave owner.  So how can you talk about the Liberty Bell and not include reparation or whatever?  People are upset with reparation and so forth.  I'm all for it, 100 percent.  If it's not money, give back as a monument, reparations for preservation.  Let repara--preservation be a part of reparation.  There's many ways.  Do we deserve something?  You're damn right, as African-American people, who--and these are the things I'm saying about with the Underground Railroad and things like that.  People who are making money off our history, give back.  People say you're a fool.  You're donating your collection.  [Arthur] Schomburg sold his; all the other collectors sold it.  I'm not a fool.  I'm not a rich man.  No, I came up poor, at one time, so-called poor.  When I was young, people around us, we had kerosene lamps, outside toilets and so forth.  We had to pick coal off the railroad tracks and all, white and black.   I came through that; I've been poor.  But what I'm saying to you, my gift to the world is the knowledge, you know.  I become rich and wealthy from collecting my books and giving, giving my knowledge and such.  You know, I don't expect all people to, to be like I am, but what I'm saying, I despise people who are using our history to make money and not give back.
Story_ID: 66171
Speaker 1: In the city of Philadelphia, the inner city's children, you know, when you come in here, you know, they, they are bright children.  Don't tell me these children can't learn.  When I show them a couple of Phillis Wheatley's poems, or a book of Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, or Zora Neale Hurston, or Frederick Douglass, Martin Delaney, and let them touch it and feel it, they become alive.  They hear--some of them have heard of these people, most people Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman, but just to hold something that Phillis Wheat--Wheatley wrote, you know, or something that Paul Robeson or Langston Hughes, one of his books or, or Claude McKay or whoever, they become alive.  So what I'm saying to you, mine is, is giving.  This is--going back to the beginning, I never knew when I first started, even following trash trucks, you know, in our hometown, hoping that a, a black book would fall off, or going to the Salvation Army, you know, hiding books, those few books, George Washington Carver, Booker T. Washington and others.  When I couldn't afford it, I would hide books behind other books, hoping-- even in those days, hoping that no one would, would get it, you know, but they would be there.  I know the one time my books rivaled my, my bedroom and all that, rivaled my football, and shot put, and discus, and basketball, and all that, athletic things, put books under, under my bed.  So my father bought a house next to us and built a den.  That--it was able to help me.  But, even now, was I, was I--as I said, my memoirs-whether I'm in Iceland, one of them Japan, one of them Africa, Brazil, Ca--Caribbean.  Wherever I go, I'm a holiday, but a--more or less a, a bookman holiday.  I'm always drawn to bookstores that I'm at him in.  And usually I find something, many--in this collection here, over, over--a collection and spent close to 150,000 items or more now.  Every since the time I da--donated, we have books in every--almost every conceivable language, 'cause people of African descent had written for hundreds of years in every conceivable language.  So therefore, I have books in the, in the--at Harvey--in Harvey of Ethiopia.  I have books in Pennsylvanian-Dutch, Yiddish, French, German, whatever.  So my scholars tell me, say, well, how can you get this, and why do you have this?  Because earlier I started out with, as my Sagittarian nation--nature--it is to--was to collect the whole of the race.  Some people specialize.  Now most collectors recently--re--they can't start--it's hard--different, unless they have a lot of money.  Still, things are drying up.  The, the rare items are drying up.  When I said the important items, the old items are drying up, but I encourage people to specialize, specialize in, in their collection.  I have a, a young, brilliant protege by the name of Dr. Greg Carr, who worked for me part time here while I was here (unclear)--to encourage him to collect.  And, and there's people like Mike Glenn down in Atlanta, Georgia, who played with the Atlanta Braves, you know--I mean Atlanta--the basketball team, the Atlanta's--
Speaker 2: Hawks.
Speaker 1: --Hawks, who's a collector, and there's other people who call back and forth.  These are my--young attorney here by the name of Michael Benjamin, who's a personal injury attorney.  These are people--and it's some young women who I've said, you know, specialize in certain areas.  I'm not gonna be here forever.  [Arthur] Schomburg wasn't here forever.  But I'm saying to, to you is that, even if they are gone, there will be other people collecting.  It's difficult to collect a whole, but I said specialized, whether it's children's books, whether it's art, there's all kinds of things you can specialize.
Story_ID: 66172
Speaker 1: Okay, now tell me about this--some of your rare finds.  I know this one book in particular people always remark about.
Speaker 2: Well most books when the children--students come here and other people, they mention my memoirs.  It's called the "Lincoln the Unknown," written by Dale Carnegie.  Well, we are familiar with Dale Carnegie because we know if his, his programs of helping people to speak, you know, the dignitaries, professionals, executives and so forth.  But in his early--earlier years, his young years when he was a young man, he wrote a book around 1933.  It was called "Lincoln the Unknown,"--"Lincoln the Unknown" about President Abraham Lincoln.  Some heinous person per--perhaps didn't like Lincoln, or didn't, didn't like African Americans, had the book bound, a portion of the book, in the human skin of a Negro.  You know, we heard about--in my memoirs, I mentioned this is not the first time.  We heard about books being bound.  This was an ancient practice.  I go back in my memoirs and, and I point out that this was a practice even during the Middle Ages with people.  Certain rulers or dignitaries who had money wanted their books, books in exotic skin, sometimes with skunks, skunks.  One per--person late years later published--had a copy of "Mein Kampf," written by Adolph Hitler published--bounded in the, in the skin of a skunk.  And so--but they thought of "Mein Kampf."  But however, we heard of Ilse Koch during World War I--World War II--the, the, the so-called "Bitch of Buchenwald," how she had lampshades made from the skins of people who were incarcerated or in the camps.  But then I discovered years ago when I was doing my work on African-American bibliophiles that [Arthur] Schomburg was involved with a book of, of poems of Charles Hartman, the great white bibliophile and bookseller, who, who promoted black bibliography and the black bibliophiles.  He, he, he felt, coming from Germany, that we needed--you know, blacks needed to--African-Americans at the time needed to collect their own history, so he was trying to persuade--he had a copy of a book of poems of Phillis Wheatley, bound in the skin of a young negro girl.  And he was trying to get Schomburg to buy it.  But, of course, Schomburg always had a little difficulty with his money and all that.  They, they (unclear) bantered back and forth what to buy and (unclear).  But however, Schomburg didn't, didn't have the money to buy it.  And even today, I don't know--I tried to over the years to trace whatever happened to that book.  I know that Texas Southern bought a portion of the [Charles] Hartman collection, and, and someone else bought another part.  But I don't know if the book still exists or whatever.  But there was a book of poems written by Phillis Wheatley bound in the skin of, of a Negro girl.  So the book I have, the young students, when they come to--here, they hear about it.  Sometimes I take it out and tell them to hold it, you know, pass it around quickly as possi--possible, you know.  But I don't tell them what it's aba--what it is until--then they go oh, ah, oh.  Then over the years, fifteen years ago, ten years ago, students come back--Mr. Blockson, do you still have that book?--I, I--you still have that book?  You know, remember, remember you showed me that book?  And then I tell 'em when they're here, don't you ever--all the books you see around here, don't you ever forget this; don't you ever forget their history.  So this is a story of the book bound in Negro skin, "Lincoln the Unknown."
Story_ID: 66173
Speaker 1: What, what's your most thrilling find?  I mean what were you most thrilled to find--(unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, that's, that's hard to answer.  Like people say, you know, what's your most important book?  It's, it's often--it's painful for me to say, because every, every book that I have related to our history was in--from Africa, Caribbean, South America, whatever, it's important to me.  Now I have some, some books, you know, that are difficult to find.  I mean very important history like the--you know, the, the travels of Leo Africanus, you know, who rediscovered Timbuktu, you know.  I have the [Olaudah] Equiano's volume--his two volumes, who commonly was called later Gustavus Vassa.  (Unclear) Equiano's (unclear)--he's a (unclear) man like I am, and his books is two volumes.  And I have the Phillis Wheatley books.  I have the original Nat Turner--"Confessions" was only about four known copies in the country, you know.  And, and the oldest book in the collection is 1557.  And I have, you know, books signed to me by Paul Robeson and other people like--and Langston Hughes letters, books by Zora Neale Hurston, you know, children books.  It's, it's, it's hard--it's like, I'll put it this way.  Being a former athlete, you know, from elementary school all the way through--went over that--each trophy, each medal, each ribbon has an association, you know.  Each book that I, I purchased over the years, and there's thousands of them, have an association what I--that I call the agony and the ecstasy.  You, as a collector, know --and other people who collect period, whether collect books or whatever--sometimes you have the money and, and you see an item and you don't have the money to pay for it.  Sometimes you see an item advertised or whatever, you make a phone call, whether it's a transatlantic phone call, a call to Paris, Amsterdam, London, whatever, you know, Brazil--someone beat me to it by a call, you know.  Other times you go to the bookstore you're on your knees, you know, at this musky bookstore, whatever, you're on your knees.  And here's a gem that you'd never heard of before, you know, or, or a gem you thought, I would never thought I would own a copy of this.  And you never know where you're gonna find books, whether along the book stalls on the quays of Paris [France] or, as I said, in Iceland.  Now who would ever think that I would find, you know, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a book in, in Iceland, you know, related to Harriet Tubman, you know?  But it was there, and other--I could tell you many, many stories--like, sometimes the mon--metropolis of Chicago [Illinois], of Detroit [Michigan], of Boston [Massachusetts] and whatever; I might find a book of something pertaining to slavery, a rare book, in, in the metropoli--also I can be in a rural area and find a book relating to one of our leading Harlem Renaissance writer, Claude McKay or a book on James Baldwin or such, you never know, you never know.  This is what I call--you know, that's the--when you find something unique and exciting, that's the ecstasy of collecting; then other times, you don't have the money to pay for it or you know, someone beat you to it, that's the agony.
Story_ID: 66174
Speaker 1: How did you--how is this Charles Blockson--Block--
Speaker 2: Charles L. Blo--yeah.
Speaker 1: --L. Blockson collection here at Temple [University] a symbol and how was that arranged?  I mean, you, you had at one time how many books and, and, and, and, and materials (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, I, I donated over 20,000 items, which was the largest.  The Schomburg had a bunch with his; he had close to 3 or 4,000--10,000 items.  My donation was over 20,000 items.  I think he had 3,000 items or so.  But over the years, I made arrangements through--as long as the university is here and there's a Charles L. Blockson have to be connected with it, that I report to the president (unclear)--re--I am ex--experienced from before, librarians are gonna tell me administrations come and go.  You know, some librarians love black books--I mean love books in general, rare books and all that.  But I attach myself--I'm connected with the main library, special collection department, but I'm attached to the president; whoever the president is, they have to honor it.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay, but how did they--how was this set, set up in the first place, and when did this start?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eight-four [1984].
Speaker 1: Eight-four [1984]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but Temple--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: One of the collections--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --back in 1973.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they--
Speaker 2: But I wa--
Speaker 1: --they contacted you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in 1973.  Other places got it, my University of Penn State and Lincoln University; one of the universities in Nigeria when [Nnamdi] Azikiwe was president they contact me; you know, a couple of places in the Caribbean and all, but I didn't wanna sell, you know, I didn't--(unclear)--it was a part of me.  But luckily for me, luckily for me, a, another collector--you understand I'm saying, I always had a duplicate collection.  I have a duplicate collection, even today.  I hate to see a book related to our history lying on the shelf or whatever.  And if it's reasonable enough buy, if I have duplicate copies or so forth, I would always buy.  So at the same time I had this collection, I always had sort of an auxiliary collection and so forth.  I mean, I gave to the world my collection.  And if--then I--they wanted me to come along with the collection so, you know, I, I retired from my other job and I came here.  But it would have been hard for me, you know, at--perhaps at that early stage.  And, and my advantage [Arthur] Schomburg, Slaughter, Adger, Clarence Holt, and people like that, they were middle-aged men when they de--disposed of their collection--one (unclear) by selling.  I was young.  Luckily for me, I started at an early age, okay.  I'm--I'll be sixty-nine in, in December, you know.  All of the--I did--I had that advantage over the rest of the people, you know, to collect.  And so, therefore, when I bought the collection here, you know, I brought it here at a time when Temple was going through some pain over the African studies program, although I wasn't here in the 19--early '70s [1970s] when Dr. Reddick was here, Lawrence Reddick, who was also head of the Schomburg collection.  He had Arthur Schomburg (unclear)--it was--and taught history for many years.  He came to Temple, and he went through all that hell of trying to get the library here, the Paley Library, to order black books and so forth, but he was at the history department.  So when they were protesting in 1970, I was here with the people protesting for an African studies program before they established one.  This is--and I came here a couple of years before Molefi Asante came here.  So, in the meantime, they were trying to more or less disseminate--to eliminate--the African studies program; however, when I brought my collection here, that--the African scholars and all the 700 people here were so thrilled.  Then later on, when Asante came, when he started the doctoral program, this collection supported his efforts, 'cause he was here (unclear) from Howard Dawson, Howard Dawson--my good friend, Howard Dawson, came down and also to, to help promote it.  So this collection have paved the way in a lot of areas, where the historical markers--I mean, all the media from all over, they call--I get calls from all over, so it's an asset to the University.  Right now, however, I need more space, and I need to prepare for someone to replace me.  I need--I don't know--I do not want it to come to a point where there's gonna be protest or demonstration, you know.  For the last fifteen years or more, I have been telling university, you know, I get all kind of--receive all kind of credit, what the collection has done for the university and such and such.  Now, it's time for action.  There's a lot group were upset that I don't have the space and so forth.  I'm not gonna be around forever.  I need to start now to train someone to replace me, you know.  And if that doesn't happen, all this in my contract, if Temple [University] doesn't live up to it, I could take the portion of what I donated and leave.  That's in my contract.  It's im--it's important to have a contract, because they had another program here.  Dr. Betty Keyer (ph.) Thomas--I helped Betty to come up here from when she was down at the Women's Center in Washington to, to start a Black Culture Center.  You know, they started the Black Culture Center.  The Black Culture Center was in between this collection and the African studies department and, however, it's gone now.  All the material it's, it's gone; they just cleaned it out, and they, they didn't say a mumbling word about it.  And this is not gonna happen to this collection, 'cause I got people in Africa; I got activists in the community and such.  If need be, if need be, I will go down fighting for this collection.  So this is the stage I'm in right now, you know, and if, if push comes to shove, I will push to protect our history and the legacy of our ancestors, and not only of our ancestors, those of other races who contributed towards this collection.
Story_ID: 66175
Speaker 1: Do you consider--I, I suppose you have to consider this--your legacy?  This is--this collection.
Speaker 2: Brother Larry, my legacy?  No, it's not my legacy.  It's our legacy.  It's, it's the legacy of our ancestors, our people who are living today, and the legacy of the souls who are yet to be born.  You know, I'm only a passing comment, like we all are, in this, this, this, this, this life, you know.  I'm not interested in material things; I never was into new cars and all that.  I mean, I like to be presentable and have a car, or home, or whatever, whatever, but to me--and I'm not putting you on when I'm saying this--knowledge and giving, you know, giving, you know, giving is my legacy.  People give--some people like Dr. Benjamin Carson and that--he's a healer.  People give in some--like Dr. [Martin Luther] King as an orator or Frederick Douglass, orator, or whatever, Martin Delaney or So--Sojourner Truth, I mean [Harriet] Tubman, [Paul] Robeson.  You go all the way back, they all gave something.  We're all just a part of one little wheel.  Like the old saying goes, you're here today, and you're gone tomorrow.  This is my legacy.  But as I said earlier, I'm fortunate.  I'm--I, I was blessed, blessed.  I have my pains and tri--tribulations in life and the divorce and all the other pain of like a death.  I had all--I had this, you know.  I was always blessed with good health, but I was always with the knowledge of knowing who I am, after reading our history.  Once you know your history, there's no force on earth can turn you around.  Go to Africa; go to Brazil; go to at least to our Mother Africa and see our people walking around proud with their head up in the air, beautiful statues of women who know.  We don't see people bending over and such, such.  We came from Africa.  As Robeson or as Othello said in Shakespeare, you know, "Greater than that of a Europe."  And so far, as far as the race, we all are Africans, and until humankind is set on another subject or I mean on another continent, so far archaeologist and other have to say that we all are part of the African continent.  So what is this racism and colorism, you know?  It's to me, it's a disease; it's, it's the worst kind of evil we can have, so--but you--but this all ties in with the history of, of a people.  I mean, reparation, reparation and so forth is what I'm doing here, is knowledge and giving back.  It's a part of our history.
Story_ID: 66176
Speaker 1: One last question I guess.  It's kind of different from the legacy question, but similar (unclear).  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, that's a deep question.  How would I like to be remembered?  A seeker, a finder, and a giver, a person who sought, found, and he gave back.  And what I gave back is the knowledge of our people.  It's hard to write an epitaph, like, you know, like there's a book written in--it's, it's like Willard Motley.  You ever hear of a book "Let No Man Write My Epitaph"?  And Willard Motley is connected with, you know, the Motleys and the, the artists of Chicago.
Speaker 1: Audrey Motley?
Speaker 2: Audrey, all related, but how--who am I to say about epi--I mean I don't know.  I mean that's, that's what I would like--that's how I see myself, as a seeker, finder, and a giver.
Story_ID: 66177
Speaker 1: Now, did you--what did your--did you--I know, I know your mother lived long enough to see you be honored for these (unclear)--
Speaker 2: My father is still living.
Speaker 1: He's still living too?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and what, what do they think of all this?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother all, I mean like, like I was the oldest.  I mean she was--like, she was my soul mate like my daughter, we're, we're soul mates.  And although my mother passed, like, she's still with me and all that.  But what I'm saying is that it was expected, and although I was a fairly good athlete and all that, it was like I always did--all my honors and awards and trophies and all that, I learned early.  They taught me--they wouldn't--getting to your question--they wouldn't--they're not surprised.  They were proud.  They were--my mother and them they were proud, all my sisters and all that.  What I'm saying is that I learned early and something I've never forgotten, you know, around junior high school and high school or getting all this fame and all the other stuff, you know, these are not for me, they said to me particularly, but just as a reminder, they said remember, all your trophies and medals and awards, you couldn't buy a loaf of bread with them.  You couldn't buy a loaf of bread.  It's always say--when someone's saying how good you were and all that, thank them and go on, and remember there's always someone else out there doing greater things than you will ever to do--ever, ever do.  Just be grateful that you had the opportunity to do what you're doing.  So, to put it this way, they were proud of what I'm doing and so forth, but only thing I can say, that I was fortunate.  I was brought up with the strong household.  And what I'm saying, I have--I was blessed to have a father and mother.  And so many of our children today do not have--they live in a single-parent home, you know.  I was blessed, you know, to have extended family around me, neighborhoods and so forth around me, you know.

Speaker 1: So when I--when you talk about how would they feel, my classmates, and teammates, and all the other kind of stuff, they're proud of what I'm going through and all that, but--and some of them years later--like my good friend, Lenny Moore, said, you know, said man, you know, he said, I couldn't understand Rosey [Roosevelt Grier]--well, Rosey--both of them said--and he said, both told me, we didn't understand you, Charlie, he said, you know, when you left the New York Giants, you know, the training camp, you know, you could have made the team; you know, we didn't understand, but, but now we understand you.  And both of them call me for information.  There's book--Lenny's having a book written about him now.  I mean, we--Rosey called me and all that, so what I'm saying, they see now, you know, but said, you were--they tell me, you were blessed; you weren't sucked in.  Like Lenny has a chapter in his book similar to going to their graves enraged of, of the many pro football players and others, you know, that he knew of who were just angry, angry now, you know.  And they're, you know, they're dying of rage, not because that they're making more money than before, but just how they had their lives concentrated on one effort.  You know, fame is like the early spring, it comes and goes.  And most athletes, most entertainers, most people in profess--they think they're gonna be remembered forever and ever and ever.  And I realized early that every year--it's like a slave plantation.  I hate to distort my history.  Every four years there's a new group of slaves come in, enslaved Africans coming in.  Going back to the time, as I mentioned in the book--and I hope this tie in with one of the (unclear) thing--is that, back in 1955, Emmett, Emmett Till, Emmett Till was, was, was killed, assassinated, murdered and thrown in the, in the, in, in, in the river in Mississippi.  I forget the name of the river--a river in Mississippi.  You know, it's just brought tears.  I was in--1955 I was in my junior year, junior year and standing in the pregame line.  In every pregame for football before the game started they played "The Star-Spangled Banner."  And I swore that I would never sing the "The Star-Spangled" again, you know, until I felt the urge to do it.  So I sip--I subject to--I mumbled--I humbled--I hummed the lift up-"Lift Up Every Voice and Sing while they were playing the "The Star-Spangled Banner."  I said, here we are, a group of African Americans, the forefathers on the team, Jessie Arnelle, Rosey Grier, and myself, Lenny Moore, and one of our brothers, young brothers, had just been humiliated, lynched, and murdered in Mississippi, you know, and we're up here, we can't do--and, and, and have the audacity to sing "The Star-Spangled Banner."  With tears coming out of my eyes, I sang "Lift Up Every Voice and Sing," written by James Weldon Johnson and his brother, J. Rosamond Johnson, our national anthem.  So this is what--the turmoil, as Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois the great said, we have a double consciousness.  Yes, we were there.  We were role models.  We were Depression babies, you know.  There weren't that many African Americans in those days.  We know to go to school, we had enough pressure upon us, because at Penn State, it wasn't really a happy valley for us African Americans up there.  It was very few of us up there.  Those of us who were athletes, we were on a pedestal.  So what I'm saying to you, whatever I accomplished in life, I take a greater honor--not to go against sports, 'cause I've never have--would have gone to college without sports.  I take a greater honor of seeing my name on the title page of a book that I've written than all of my trophies and medals put together.  This is my thoughts.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much.
