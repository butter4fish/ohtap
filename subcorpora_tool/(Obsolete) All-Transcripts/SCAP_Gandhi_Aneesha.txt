DANA:	So, I’m Alaria Dana, interviewing Aneesha Gandhi for the Alumnae Oral History Project on May 20th, 2017.  I just want to start by asking you where are you from?

GANDHI:	Right now, I live in Chicago, Illinois.  I originally was born in — or I was born in (laughter) England in Gillingham.  And I immigrated here with my family when I was about two years old.  Then we lived in the Bronx, New York, and eventually moved to the Midwest to Wisconsin and then Michigan.  So Michigan’s my home.  So, yeah but currently, a Chicagoan. (laughs)

DANA:	And how did you come to Smith?

GANDHI:	My sister — I had a little bit of a hard year my sophomore year of high school.  My first and sophomore year I wasn’t taking it seriously as much, and I was just having whatever issues happen when you’re that age. (laughs) I can’t really remember.
But my sister was at Harvard for — at the Divinity School — for her master’s, and she met a Smithie, like, there.  And I think her name was Amy.  I can’t remember her last name.  And she told my sister like, “Get your sister in gear, and tell her to try to increase her grades and all that kind of stuff.  And I bet that she would be a good candidate for Smith or that she should try for women’s colleges.”  And I was like, Oh, no. (laughter) I don’t think that would be good for me.
But I visited then, and so I — now this is like — it’s junior year.  So I got my grades up, and I visited Smith with my dad.  And I remember doing all the things and seeing how, just people were able to express themselves the way they wanted to express themselves.  It just felt like really — I felt this instantaneous feeling of home.  Like, this is a good place for me, and I had visited a couple other colleges before we got to Smith.  So, I felt different feelings when I was there.
And then I remember walking down Paradise Pond with — or Paradise the road — And then I was, like, crying.  I [was like?], I want to go to here. (laughter) And my dad is like, Well, if you don’t get in this year, take a year off.  Get your — you know, we’ll do it.  If you really want to be here, we’ll get you here.
And then when I got in, I did early decision because I was like, I want to be here.  I want to go here.
And then Amy — who I wish I remembered her last name, I’m going to have to ask my sister — she sent me Smith Voices, the book, that I don’t know if they still have it, and it’s like all famous Smithies and their writings, different snapshots of each other’s, so that was really nice.
And ever since, but, yeah, that’s how I came here.  It was a really long story, but — (laughter)

DANA:	So, how did you feel about the women’s colleges after you got here?

GANDHI:	Well, I remember meeting people in my class who were like, I didn’t even know it was a women’s college.  And I was like, that’s very strange to me. (laughter) But I felt that — how did I feel about it while I was here?  Right?

DANA:	Mm-hmm.

GANDHI:	I felt like I was one lucky person, that I was a lucky woman that I was able to be around so many women from all different backgrounds that were coming together to help everyone learn.  It felt like everybody was wanting to have this amazing experience of, like, this is the one time in your life that you’ll probably ever be with just maybe women or like — Yeah, so I mean, at times it was strange, I guess, because I had been in co-ed education for a while.
But I was very, like, had a lot of self-esteem issues.  And I remember — and saw like confidence, I think — but I remember it almost, it was after a semester that my family told me it just completely changed, my demeanor and everything around — because — and I do credit Smith for that, and my friends and peers that really it was amazing to have my first semester — I remember Asian American Experiences was a first-year seminar, and just being in a circle kind of environment with two professors and then a bunch of other — and then mostly women — it was a really nice experience.  I had never had that.
I went to public schools, and I had a really good public school education.  I’m not dissing the public school educa– (laughs) system, but it was unique, and I just remember feeling like, Wow.  I’m like — I never thought I could be in this space, like, in this —  I just — when I think back to my sophomore year, I remember, at my first year, I was thinking back to my sophomore year in high school, and I never could’ve imagined being in such a environment.  It never occurred to me that that would be my life. (laughs)

DANA:	Where did you live you when you were here?

GANDHI:	I was in Cushing, and I stayed in Cushing all three years I was here.  I only — my junior year I went to Spain, so — But, yeah, I’m a Cushing bunny. (laughs)

DANA:	What was the social life there like?

GANDHI:	I instantaneously made friends with, like, four other Cushing one Ls or one year.  Sorry, first years, I’m saying one like it’s–

DANA:	(laughs)

GANDHI:	–a law school.  But anyways — and it was fun, like, we —  I think we tried to go out to like UMass Amherst [University of Massachusetts Amherst] once or twice, and I was like, I’m not doing that again (laughs) because it was not cute. (laughter)
But after that, we just kind of — we tried to interact with as many of the older classes that we could.  We had a really great senior class, and they were just wild but also really smart and really took us in.  And we had the big sib and the little sib situation.  And my big sib was the wildest of them all. (laughter) So that was interesting.
But it was a lot about community.  I felt like a community was being built, even though all of us were different.  Not everyone got along, obviously, but for the most part everyone came to tea.  We had tea on Saturdays.  I can’t remember why, but I know that most houses have it on Fridays.  But we had it on Saturday, and even — you just came around and ate.  You didn’t have to talk to — you know, and it was nice.  And then we had those house parties and things like that, and yeah.
I felt like it was a built-in community.  They made — it’s like something that’s unique to Smith that you get put in a house.  You maybe get a little bit of say of where but maybe not at all, and it’s kind of — but not forcing you but gently pushing towards (laughs) learning how to interact with a lot of different people from different places and make really strong connections, you know?

DANA:	Mm-hmm.

GANDHI:	My best friend is still somebody I — was my first-year friend.  So, it’s special.  It’s a special place.  Yeah. (laughs)

DANA:	Were you involved in any clubs or organizations when you were here?

GANDHI:	I — for a little bit, I did EKTA [South Asian Organization of Smith College], which is Ethnic South Asian American Organization.  I was in the class cabinet.  It’s really hard for me to remember (laughter) things.  I’m like -- I don’t know.  I did — I represented Cushing, I think, for a year.  I’m trying to think if I was on anything else.
I feel like I was busy all the time, but I — one thing that I know about myself is that I needed extra time for schoolwork, and so I did that.  And then I futzed around too, but for the most part it was a lot of academic.  Like, I really wanted to do well.  I wanted to — I wanted the school not to feel like they shouldn’t have admitted me or something. (laughs)  You know, I had that kind of mentality in my head.  I wanted to prove myself as a s– I wanted to prove myself as a Smithie, as like how the people that I’d met.  And so I really did focus on that.
But I’ve — yeah, I might have to come back.  I don’t know if I did anything else. (laughs)

DANA:	What was the idea of like a Smith student while you were here?

GANDHI:	(laughs) Outside the box.  Not — I feel — I think that people could express themselves, their gender, their — just their personalities fully here.  Even if I, myself, didn’t want to break out into whatever outfit or thing.  I appreciated that other people were able to do that, and I felt — I never was like, Oh, gosh, what is she wearing, (laughs) or anything like that, but I was like, Wow.  That’s amazing that you can do that.
So I felt like that was a big part of Smithies.  I think Smithies are also really, like, vocal.  You know, if they don’t like something they say it, and I think that’s something that I was a little bit like, Whoa.  What’s going –– but I was glad to see it.
I grew up with two very strong women, my sister and my mom, but there are certain things that I — we all weren’t exposed to for different reasons.  So Smith was really like an eye opener as to like what you could be.  You could be all these different things and even if you never thought you wanted, but you can at least appreciate that other people may have wanted that, and now they feel safe to do to that.
So, yeah.  I hope that was answering your question, but — (laughs)

DANA:	And do you want to talk about just a little bit what you studied here, and–

GANDHI:	Yeah.

DANA:	–what that was like for you?

GANDHI:	Yeah.  I was an American Studies major and a Spanish major.  I didn’t know I was going to be a Spanish major until, I think, close to end of my junior year when Nancy Sternbach, who is a Smith Spanish professor here, she — I was — we were lucky enough that she was with us in Spain.  And she told me — she was like, “You’re only like —“ I forgot how many classes — “away from being a major”.  And I was like, Hmm.  I was just going to be a minor.  I think I’m done with the minor. (laughs) And she was like, Well, try–  you know, and she encouraged me, and so I was like, You know what?  I want to keep up my Spanish, and so why not?  So, I did that.
But my American Studies was — I did a concentration in Asian American studies, I guess it was called.  And I really wanted to focus on, like, how Asian Americans — I really wanted to focus on learning about my history, my immigration history here, but I focused on Asian American images and the way in which Asian Americans are perceived in the media and in politics and all that kind of stu–  I kind of focused more on images in media, but it was great.  My advisor for it was Floyd Cheung, who I took my first-year seminar with.
So, yeah.  It was nice.  It was good. (laughs)

DANA:	What have you done since you graduated?

GANDHI:	I went — I moved to Boston.  Well, my dad made me move home.

DANA:	(laughs)

GANDHI:	And then he was like, “Get a job in Boston, and you can go out there.”  And I couldn’t get a job.  I don’t know what was going on.
So I was like, I’m going to sell this car that I have.  (laughs) I’m going to make it down to Boston.  I bet I will find a job once I get there.  And that was — so I sold my car.  I drove out there.  I lived with my friend, Erin Lockney, who is also a 2007.  And we lived in Jamaica Plain, and I lived there for — or I worked for two years.
And I worked for a labor and employment law firm that represents, like, some of the larger unions in Boston.  It’s called Segal Roitman, and my mentor there, he was just like, “Go to law school.  Let’s get you into law school.”  And I was like, ”Let’s do that!”  (laughter) And he used to be an English teacher, so he was really helpful and he wanted to look at my essay and all that.  So then, I really liked Northeastern because they are public interest oriented.
And dur– while I was at Segal Roitman, I was like, Ah, I think I want to do, like, union labor employment law.  But then I was like, But there’s something missing here because there was a lot of union old union guys, and I was like, I don’t know if I want to interact with them on the daily basis that it would have to take to be a lawyer for them. (laughter)
But there was a good group of Brazilian, undocumented immigrants that had been physically harmed from their job, and it was towards the end of my first year.  And I just remember being like, I want to work with them.  I want to work with immigrant workers because I — it was just so egregious what had happened, and I don’t think it registered to me that that was going on.  I read about it in American hi– you know, study stuff.  And — but I didn’t — I don’t think it clicked that it’s going on right now.  And I hadn’t really made that connection.
Then when I got to law school, I went to Northeastern University School of Law, and they’re public interest oriented.  And they are really big on experiential learning, so after your first year you go every other quarter on a — it’s like a co– They call it a co-op, but it’s an internship, 11 weeks, so I did that for three years.  (laughs) And I got through it which was [an] accomplishment (laughter) for me, for most people.
And then I went to — I did the internships and all that stuff, and then I moved back home.  I didn’t have a job, but I took the bar.
And then I — I always, kind of, shifted from wanting to work with workers because I had done — I went to a worker center in New Orleans.  It was amazing, but I was like, Ah, there’s something missing here.  And then I did direct services with individuals who were seeking different types of relief in the immigration court, and I really fell in love with the work that I did with this one client.  He was a trans youth from Brazil.  (laughs) And I really, like, just connected with him.  And I felt like we were — it was the best work I had done so far in law school, and I was like, Wow.  One day I want to just represent LGBT individuals, immigrants.  This is it.  This is what I want to do.   And I thought, “Okay, just, like, work towards that five years.  Like, make that a five-year goal after law school.”
But I ended up getting a job at the National Immigrant Justice Center in Chicago in August 2013, and with their LGBT project.  So it’s called the LGBT Immigrant Rights Initiative.  I started off as a staff attorney and then about a year and a half ago, I became the supervising attorney of the project.  So, it’s amazing.  (laughter) It’s hard, but it’s also — I couldn’t imagine doing anything else, and I feel so lucky to have landed where I landed at this point in my life, so — (laughs)

DANA:	So — and how did you decide to come to reunion?

GANDHI:	Oh, that’s — that was like a no-brainer.

DANA:	(laughs)

GANDHI:	At my two year — I went to my two year, even though that year was the first year that there were no more two year.  And we were like, No.  Oh, okay.  We’re going to come anyways. (laughter) So a couple of my friends and I came, and then I went to my five year, and then  I was like, I have to go to my 10 year (laughs) as long as I get -- a couple of my friends are coming, it’ll be good.  Yeah, so it was kind of like a, If you can afford it, you should come, so — (laughs)

DANA:	And do you have any advice for current Smith students?  Do you have any comments on if Smith has changed at all or what you’d like to see happen?

GANDHI:	I loved my experience at Smith, but there were times when I felt like things weren’t being addressed promptly.  (laughs) And so, I would hope, and I would like for that to be different.
And I went to the Inclusion, Diversity and Equity (laughs) presentation.  And I can’t remember his first name, but Mr. [Dwight] Hamilton spoke.  And I was really impressed with all the things, and I was shocked.  I was like, We didn’t have this before, (laugh) but it’s amazing that we have it.  And it shows me that Smith is taking this seriously if — and that it’s an issue and that they’re addressing it.  So I hope that he’s been a good addition.  It seemed like he has so far.
And my advice is, I mean, especially to women of color or people of color here, I just want them to know that they got in just as — at the same level at any white student that’s here, and that they belong here, that they deserve to be here, you know?
I think that was something that I struggled with at times.  I felt like people — you know, everyone comes from all these different backgrounds.  Some people came, like — I felt like they had already gone to college.  It was like, Where did you read that?  When did you learn you that?  You know?
And they were a little pretentious about it, (laughs) so it’s hard to be a student of color.  I feel, already, like, second guessing yourself, thinking that you tricked them into admitting you when – it’s not addressed in the classroom or there’s not like this I see you moment.  So I just made sure I did cla– took classes, I think, with people who I thought would see me and be — and surround myself with friends that I felt like would do the same, you know?
So, my advice is to do that.  You don’t have to be friends with that person over there.  You can be cordial.  You can be kind, but you should — this is your time to be a little bit selfish, I think, and really try to develop yourself in a way that will lead you to where you want to be.
Yeah.

DANA:	Yeah.  Anything else?

FEMALE:	Excellent.

GANDHI:	Good.

DANA:	Okay, (unclear).

GANDHI:	Yeah.  Yay. (laughs)
