 Finchum Today is June 20, 2016. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with Oklahoma State University, and today I am in Roger Mills County, the town of Cheyenne, to interview Jan Cloyde. This is part of our Cowboys in Every County project, so thank you for having me today.  Cloyde I am very pleased to have you and have you out here. (Laughter)  Finchum It   s a very pretty town and a pretty county so far, that I   ve seen.  Cloyde Thank you. People who are from here are very proud of it, and have done a lot of work to make it that way. I don   t know if you saw our park, our city park, with the museums, and the ball fields, and the swimming pool. There   s a lot here that the people who live here have worked hard on and are very proud of.  Finchum It has a good, hometown feel about it, I think.  Cloyde Yeah, it does.  Finchum Well, were you born here?  Cloyde I was born in Oklahoma City, but have lived here since I was six months old, four or five months old actually. In fact, the beginning of this house in which we   re sitting is the house I grew up in my whole life. Then after our parents died, I asked the seven nieces and nephews to sit down with my brother, and sister, and me. We arranged what we thought would be good to hold everybody when everybody could be here, so we added on about twice as much as the original house. We have lots of bedrooms, and bathrooms now, and a really fun kids    room that I   ll show you, which has three sets of bunkbeds, and all kinds of fun animals in it for kids. It   s neat.  Finchum Do you mind telling what year you were born? 5  Cloyde No, I was born in 1950.  Finchum And you have a brother and a sister.  Cloyde Yes.  Finchum Where are you in the order?  Cloyde I   m the baby. We   re far apart. Larry   s fifteen years older than I, and Barbara   s eight years older than I. While I have no children, they have four and three, respectively, with sixteen, as I call them,    greats,    and my life is very dedicated to spoiling them, which is a lot of fun.  Finchum That   s a lot of age difference between all three of you. They spread them out, intentionally maybe, to help with college?  Cloyde You know, I think it was a sign of the times and how difficult it was back then as much as anything, economically. It was really   especially early in the parents    marriage, it was a hard, hard life. They remember   I have stories of when Larry was a baby. They would wash tea towels, or rinse them in water, and hang them on the windows during the Dust Bowl days to try to keep from just smothering this baby with all the dirt that was around. Pretty bleak times.  Finchum Were they from here, originally, your parents?  Cloyde No, had moved here the generation before.  Finchum Okay, and what did they do for a living?  Cloyde We had a variety of things in the family. We have an extended family, so I always talk about it. Everybody ranched and farmed, and then we said, they usually had another job to pay for it. My parents, he was the State Highway Department foreman for the county. She was, all my life, a stay-at-home mother, very active in the community and that kind of thing, but did not work outside the home.  Finchum Room mother, brought the cupcakes and cookies to school.  Cloyde Yeah, she wasn   t too big on that, but at least she was always here when I got home, where I knew where I was going to be. It was a great way to grow up. As I said, we had a very big extended family, so I had other aunts and uncles living in the town, with cousins. We just kind of roamed from one house to another. Also growing up in a town like Cheyenne, which I know it was an unusual time in the   50s versus these days, but we knew everybody, and 6  where they lived, and whose house we could go to, and whose we couldn   t or shouldn   t. It was just kind of a really nice upbringing.  Finchum What was the main street like during your childhood?  Cloyde Well, I don   t know if you had a chance to take a spin down it. When I grew up, there were four grocery stores, two drugstores, two dry goods stores, three or four car dealerships, so it was quite the bustling place. On Saturday afternoons at two or two thirty, they had    the    drawing, which was sponsored by the merchants. I think the first prize could grow, so it might be eighty or ninety dollars, and then the second one was twenty-five and the third, ten, or something like that. People were in the stores at drawing time because they wanted a chance to win that money. We could just go to the stores, and everybody knew us. I remember one of my first summer jobs, the money I saved...I   d had my eye on an outfit or something in one of them, and got to go in myself and proudly pick it out, and pay for it. That was a big deal.  My grandma was an amazing matriarch. Unfortunately, I didn   t know my grandfather because he died right before I was born, but Grandma was quite a pistol. She decided we would all go to coll   I mean, it was just not a question in our family that we were going to go to college. Of her seven children, who were spread over about twenty years in their births, and she didn   t start until she and Grandad were twenty-five, nearly, I think five of the seven did get to go to college, A M, of course. When Grandma would start downtown in her    49 Pontiac, she started at the top of Main Street that went by the courthouse, if you noticed it, and then on in. People would go,    Here comes Grandma Bradshaw  Get out of the way,    because you never knew.  She drove in a unique way with a foot on the brakes and a foot on the gas, and so it was exciting. I remember once, when she decided to go to Shattuck for something, and she loaded my cousin, Ricky, and me in the backseat, and one of her contemporaries was in front. I remember thinking as we went out of town,    Oh, they   re not going to like that we did this.    (Laughs) She was amazing. She taught school up in the bend of the river, when they were one-room schoolhouses. The oldest children, who were old enough, would be in class. The one who was just younger than old enough to go to school would rock the cradle, and the baby would be in the cradle, and it was just all contained. Education and reading were always very important to us.  Finchum Would she have a selection of books at her house?  Cloyde That   s interesting, Tanya, because I don   t remember that many books at her house, and I don   t know if that was just a luxury they couldn   t afford then, but we were always reading, or some of us were always reading. She 7  certainly encouraged that, so that   s a good question. I   ll have to quiz some of the older cousins about that a little bit.  Finchum What was the source of the books? Well, the town does have a library, I noticed, but it might not have in those days.  Cloyde Didn   t have when I was growing up. In fact, I remember I loved to read so much. I remember one year in early elementary school, I thought,    Oh, I   ve read all my books, and school   s going to be out. What am I going to do?    Fortunately, within the family, we got them. I remember one of my favorite books was Trixie Belden. I don   t know if you have a daughter, but she was this sleuth kid, I don   t know, nine or eleven or something. When the new books would come out, the TG Y at Elk City, which was the nearest bigger town, would get them. I would save my fifty-nine cents, and go get those new Trixie Belden books. I thought they were really special.  Finchum What had you had to do in order to earn fifty-nine cents?  Cloyde When I was young   well, I babysat. Before I started   I taught music, I worked as the church secretary, and the secretary at my uncle   s service station until Grandma found out that I was also washing windows. She didn   t think that was the proper thing for me to do. Then I was banned from working at the service station, but I was church secretary, and I gave music lessons, and babysat.  Finchum As a youngster, do you remember getting a first allowance?  Cloyde I do. I always got an allowance, or I got an allowance early on. I think it was fifty cents, and it   s hard to believe it would be fifty cents a week, so maybe that was a month. I don   t really know, but yeah, I got an allowance until I was then working and made my own money.  Finchum What were holidays like?  Cloyde Oh, wait  I forgot one of my important jobs  I worked at the Country Boy Drive-In, which was   come and get milkshakes and hamburgers and stuff. It had a little counter with four seats. I went to work there, I guess, before my eighth grade year or maybe my eighth grade year, because the woman that owned it roomed with Grandma. One day, Grandma decided I should have a job, so she told Eloise that I would be there to work on Saturday. Bless her heart, she hired me. I remember that first check, it was for six hours, for one day. Three dollars and sixty cents, I thought it was fabulous. (Laughter) Now what did you ask me?  Finchum You went to the bank and cashed it?  8  Cloyde No, I think I had an account very early on. Part of my learning money, fiscal responsibility was I got the money for my piano lessons, then I had to write a check for them to the teacher. I think I already had an account then.  Finchum I was asking about holidays. What was Christmas like?  Cloyde The holidays were the best, and a lot of it was because, I think, of our close family. Thanksgiving and Fourth of July we would go to the ranch. One of my uncles lived on part of the original ranch that the grandparents had had when they first came to Roger Mills County, way out north in the bend of the Canadian River. On the Fourth of July, there would be barbeque set up, and they would make barbequed chicken, and all the women would bring salads, and vegetables, and desserts, but we also would have homemade ice cream, and a variety of cakes. Then after it got dark, the uncles and the older kids would set off all the fireworks. There are sixteen or eighteen of us cousins, so you can imagine with five to seven uncles thrown in, all the activity that was out there for fireworks.  On Thanksgiving, the men would get up, and boys, and go very early to the ranch and would hunt quail. Then the women and children would come a little bit later with food. There would be lots of turkeys, and dressing, and all kinds of food. The table would extend from the utility room, through the kitchen, through the family room, just filled with food. You   d fill your plates and sit wherever. Later that afternoon, setting up for the really big holiday, the kids exchanged names with each other, and the adults exchanged names. That was a big event, and when you were of certain age, you got to assist in that process. Carry the hat around, you got the hat from one of the uncles, and carried it around, and let people draw the names.  Come Christmas, I mean, we were always at fever pitch, as a child anyway, but one aunt and uncle with three children, who were two years apart, starting two years younger than myself, so they would arrive. After a while, I was in charge of them because everybody went downtown to the movie theater, which was the Rook Theater, center aisle, six seats on each side. I guess the Chamber or whomever sponsored a free movie. It was a Christmas movie, and then we would storm out of the theater, and down the street, to the bank, where we were actually allowed to parade through the bank, and Santa would be sitting there. Having come in   the firetruck having met his sleigh at the airport, and transporting him in, which was a big event. We would go through, and everyone would get a bag of treats. I mean, that was just fever pitch already.  One year, my cousin, James, whom we call Baby James. He   s now a judge, and he   s just four years younger than I, but then he was Baby James. He fell down in the theater when we were all storming out, and I thought,    Oh  James is going to be dead, and Grandma is going to be so mad at me.    9  Fortunately, he was not dead. A neighbor picked him up, and we got our bags of treats, but then everybody would arrive at Grandma   s house. Probably the living room and the dining room were not as big as this room we   re sitting in, and the kitchen, and everybody would bring like homemade candies, and breads, and that sort of thing.  First, the kids would be so excited because we always knew we were getting two presents at Grandma   s house. One from Grandma, and one from the kid who had drawn our name, and so it was crazy. Before we could have the presents, we had    the    program. I think of it all in capital letters, THE PROGRAM, and    the    program was the little bitty kids would sing    Away in a Manger,    the little bit bigger kids would do maybe a reading, and then we would start on our instruments. I always say whatever instrument one played in band depended totally on what cousin had just graduated from high school, so that instrument was under the bed, so that   s the one that we played. We would have all of these instrumentations, and they were, I   m sure, awful, just awful.  I know people were   that   s why the uncles were away in the other room, drinking coffee. After the program, then we got to exchange gifts. It was so exciting, and so fun, and playing with all the other cousins. Then we all came home, and Santa came to our house the next morning. Then we could choose one thing to take back down to Grandma   s to play with everybody. It was   I think back now, and I think,    What a magical way to grow up.    We didn   t have   we certainly weren   t wealthy. We had enough to eat and everything, but to have that kind of celebration, and it   s such a blessing. It just awes me now to think about it, as I know more about the world, but that was my wonderful way of growing up. The holidays were great.  Finchum What about birthday celebrations?  Cloyde Oh, my birthday. See, I thought there were two major events in every year, Christmas and my birthday. For a while, I had a good friend who lived here, whose birthday was the same day. It was in the summer, which made it very nice, and probably why I thought a major holiday in the summer, major holiday in the winter. We would have a birthday party together, generally. One of my aunts, who was a very good cake-maker, would do two rounds ones but set together sort of. It   d say,    Happy Birthday, Jan and Charlene,    or something, and we would invite all the little kids because you didn   t not invite people. Usually have it at the park, until my sister was the lifeguard, and then we had it at the pool and the park because she could lifeguard for it. Those were big times, kind of what I looked forward to probably all summer until it came along.  Finchum What month was it?  10  Cloyde August.  Finchum In the heat of the summer.  Cloyde Oh yes, totally in the heat. I remember, of course, that was before seatbelts and children being in restraints. I remember it filled the backseat of my dad   s car, these toys and things. I remember standing in the floor, hanging on to the front seat because there wasn   t room in the backseat for me to sit down because of all my loot, which I thought was just wonderful. (Laughs) It   s fun to think about.  Finchum And you were good with sharing it?  Cloyde You know, I think I was pretty good with sharing it, but the thing is there weren   t any other kids who lived up here, where we did. This was not in the city limits then. It was just outside, and I grew up with our having all corrals and fenced pastures behind us. We would typically have cows when it was time to work them, and we   d have a horse sometimes. I think we even had a pig once and some chickens once. There weren   t any other kids who lived up here, so after I was old enough then to have kids visit or I   d visit them, yeah, I don   t remember not sharing. I think I was always so happy to have someone to play with that it was fine with me.  Finchum Did you have a bicycle that you could ride into town?  Cloyde I had a bicycle, and I rode to town.  Finchum Not too far to do that.  Cloyde No, it wasn   t too far at all. I could go to Grandma   s house if Rascal, the big dog, went with me. Rascal never met a person she didn   t like, but I guess Grandma thought she looked scary or something. I could walk there with Rascal.  Finchum Where did you go to elementary school?  Cloyde I went to elementary school at Cheyenne Elementary School. I went to high school at Cheyenne High School. That   s before the days of middle school, or we didn   t have junior high, so you were in the elementary from one through eight then, and the high school nine through twelve. It predated, at least in Cheyenne, it predated pre-k, and kindergarten, and all that, so I went to school here.  Finchum Favorite subject?  11  Cloyde Oh, probably   I liked a lot of things. Probably reading and music, those were probably the favorites.  Finchum Besides piano, did you do another instrument?  Cloyde I did. In the band, I played first the clarinet, and then the saxophone. While I was most accomplished at the piano, I also played the organ, particularly if it were needed. If somebody else could play the piano at church, then I could play the organ. I sang as well, so I did all of those. I, probably throughout high school, gave music lessons, voice and piano, to younger kids just starting.  Finchum That   s pretty good.  Cloyde It was very good. The sad thing is becoming a workaholic and letting it go.  Finchum Did you like to practice?  Cloyde I did not like to practice. Unless I could get hooked on a phrase I knew wasn   t right or something, and then I would do it over and over and over. Just to take time   I had to get at least until seventh or eighth grade to understand why I needed to practice. Before that, it was    You have to practice.     Finchum Did recitals?  Cloyde Did recitals, did state contests. In fact, this is interesting, the first year I went to state, we played in the  Oklahoma State University  Student Union auditorium, the Student Union Theater. I thought that was so cool, and I guess it was the first time I had ever played on a concert grand. On a concert grand, often when you put your foot on the soft pedal, it kind of shifts the keyboard. I had not had that occur before, so that threw me a little bit at the beginning of my solo, but then I recovered, and it went all right.  Finchum Was that the first time you   d been on campus?  Cloyde No. In fact, I saw a cousin yesterday morning at church, and said,    Do you remember when your mother got her master   s at OSU,    which she did while she was principal of the elementary school here. He said,    Well, I think I was in junior high.    He   s six years older than I, and I said,    Yeah, I was pre-school, I   m pretty sure,    and that   s the first time I recall being on campus. It was so hot, and she received her master   s, so her immediate family, and Grandma and I went. I think it was largely   I got to go because I should see the campus and see OSU, and that kind of thing.  Finchum And the pageantry of the faculty marching in? 12  Cloyde Actually, I don   t remember that part too much. I remember I had this cool, new blue purse I got to take. This is another thing. I remember we stopped at the service station somewhere along the way, and that   s when they still pumped your gas, and all that kind of thing. They always had these giveaway programs. They gave away glasses, drinking glasses, and I remember we got a drinking glass, and I thought, because I don   t think they do that in Cheyenne, I thought that was pretty cool. It   s funny the things that stick with you like that.  Finchum Were you involved with the organizations or clubs during high school?  Cloyde Yes, I was. I think   okay, there were twenty-one in our graduating class. I think it must be   well, I mean, there were some kids that weren   t involved in things. I think it was probably mainly because they had chores to do, lived on the farms, and they just couldn   t be spared, and that kind of thing. Us town kids, particularly, were involved. I was involved in, like we had something called Bearettes, which was the pep club because it   s the Cheyenne Bears, so we had that.  Junior year, we were responsible for the concession stand at the ballgames, and so I was the business manager for that. Senior year, edited the annual, and then played for everything, accompanied everything in the county basically, including funerals and weddings, but certainly the choirs, and the ensembles, and all of that. Very active in church, and we had a youth organization that went with that. It was a couple of counties, I think, and then was an officer in that, so yeah, a lot of activity.  Finchum Any hobbies developed at that time?  Cloyde Hobbies? That   s a really good question. I don   t think it even occurred to me about having a hobby.  Finchum Sew or anything?  Cloyde Oh no, I   m totally not domestic. I have learned to cook and like to cook, but as I say to my friends in LA,    I cook country.    I cook Oklahoma food, where it   s more about tasting good in mass quantities than it is looking beautiful on the plate or something. I guess reading was still my favorite thing to do.  Finchum Your pastime, that or music, I guess.  Cloyde Music, yes. You   ll hear this theme throughout my life, family was always very important. Probably, we spent more time just with the other parts of the family than maybe a lot of other folks do. The real reason we did this house 13  is because I wanted us to continue to have a central family gathering place. Usually during Christmas time sometime, the cousins who live around and their spouses, will get together one night or something. We try very hard to keep that going.  Finchum As a youngster, would you play particular games like Annie Over, or hopscotch, whatever?  Cloyde Yes, outside at Grandma   s, we would play Annie Over, and we would play Red Rover, and we would do hopscotch. She didn   t have a huge yard. Well, Hide and Seek was always very important. That was a big one, and then most everybody in our family is quite athletic. I being a rare and big exception to that. There was always a game of catch going, or playing basketball, shooting hoops. My brother played college ball, and several others of the family did too, so there was always some kind of ballgame going on. The kids would like to go hunting, sometimes fishing, just a variety of things like that.  Finchum Well did you call it lunch, dinner, or supper?  Cloyde Oh no, dinner and supper.  Finchum Dinner was the noon     Cloyde Yes.  Finchum    and then supper?  Cloyde Yeah, it was always that. I remember the first time I heard someone calling the evening meal dinner. I thought,    Wow, they   re waiting a long time to eat,    kind of thing. Then I got cued in.  Finchum What was one of the favorite things your mother fixed, or grandmother for that matter?  Cloyde Grandma did great chicken and dumplings, and she also did wonderful homemade rolls, and cinnamon rolls. If you would come in Grandma   s house after school, and smell that great yeasty smell, you knew you were in for a good treat. It seemed like Grandma always produced mass quantities of food because one of the families with four kids could drop in, and somehow she fed everybody. Here, well, we always ran cattle, so we always butchered our own beef. Actually, it was only after I was grown and went to the grocery store that I learned you actually had to choose meat, kind of thing. Because we had ours frozen in a locker, and we would just go get it when we needed meat.  14  That was a big lesson, an expensive one for me. I think probably our favorite was either round steak with biscuits and gravy, all of that typical country meal. It would probably be called a chicken-fried steak today. Sunday   s would be roast with carrots and potatoes and all that, so it could simmer while we were at church, and then be ready to put on the table when we got home. Those were probably two of my favorites.  Finchum Sunday dinner was a regular thing for the whole family?  Cloyde Yeah, and then that night, we would just eat leftovers, or I guess, bologna sandwiches. I don   t know what we ate, but there was   during the week, supper was the big meal, but Sunday, it was dinner.  Finchum What would you do in the afternoon after having the big meal, typically?  Cloyde We also played cards some, but usually I was too young, unless one of the other cousins nearer my age was around. What   d we do? In the summer, it would be too hot really to go out. I think I read a lot, we didn   t have much TV. We had the first TV because the cable guy thought that up here on the hill would be the most effective place for it, so we had the first TV. People would just come over to watch TV, but that was a little later. Typically, Sunday night for Gunsmoke, I think. I don   t know, I guess I was just too self-absorbed as a kid to really know. I think Barbara, my sister   Larry was gone by then, effectively, except I   ll tell you one of the things when he was home, but Barb would hang out with her friends like teenagers do.  We both worshipped Larry and still do. When he would come home from college, or in the summers when he was here, he was farming for everybody to earn money and that kind of thing, and doing our farming. If he would ever have a free Sunday   we had a small plane growing up. We had a two-placer for a long time, and then we had a four-placer, but this was back in the two-placer day, so one seat in front of the other. He would load Barb and me up in the plane, and we   d go fly the river. That was extra special, both because it was a really neat thing to do, and it was because he was taking us. It was just   I remember that vividly. Now, I wondered if it happened more than once, or if I just loved it so much, I have made it be a more occurring than it was, who knows. Anyway, we did that. That was really cool.  Finchum Did you learn how to fly yourself?  Cloyde I did not. Isn   t that silly?  Finchum Would you have wanted to? Obviously not or     Cloyde Well, yeah, but I think things that you take for granted, that you come up with, you think there   ll always be a chance to do it. Barb did, and Barb is 15  quite a good pilot. She soloed the day she could, which was when she was sixteen. She said,    Jan, you want to go up flying?    I said,    Sure,    because I wanted to do anything the older siblings would do. We   re up in the air, and she goes,    You   re the first person I   ve ever taken up     I remember thinking,    I think that   s a good thing,    (Laughs) but they   re quite good pilots.  Here   s another great pioneer story. My oldest uncle was the oldest of four sons. Granddad had lived through the war, but it was during the war, and of course, everybody was going. He had a trucking business, so he was not taken because his trucking business was so needed to move supplies across the country. His three younger brothers went, but they of course were Army Air Corps. I mean, they were all adventurers and were taught to fly, so he got a plane, and I think was partially self-taught and partially got somebody who was a pilot who helped teach him. He was then a pilot, so that   s why I grew up with an airplane in the family, and thought it was like a normal thing. It was really great, especially when I was really young, and the roads weren   t that good. We could get to Oklahoma City at least without it being a science project. It was nice.  Finchum You would actually fly?  Cloyde Yeah, we flew.  Finchum Cool, from here to there? Then where   s the airport here in town?  Cloyde It   s out west, if you go through town on Main Street, and go up and go around the curve, then you   ll see the sign for the airport. They   ve done a good job of keeping it up over the years. We got a government grant, that   s probably twenty years ago or so now, to expand the runway. When I was a child, this was really cool and this was fun, it would be at night, and of course there was barely a runway. It was probably not even paved, but the three or four who had planes used it. A plane would buzz really low over the house. That was a sign that somebody was coming in to land, and they couldn   t get home before dark, so it   s dark. Then the other pilots and others would just drive their vehicles out, and shine the headlights so that the plane could see to land. Necessity is the mother of invention. Pretty cool, the way they made it work.  Finchum Community, I think.  Cloyde Community, yeah, all worked together.  Finchum So you would   ve graduated high school in nineteen sixty     Cloyde Sixty-eight.  16  Finchum    eight. Vietnam was beginning or already getting in the works at that point.  Cloyde In the works, yes. One of the things that   s always kind of appalled me was that I could be so relatively ignorant of what was going on in the world at that stage of my life. When Vietnam really, I guess, impacted me was one of my good friends at college, his dad was Colonel Rob Risner, who was a prisoner of war for a long time. Through Rob, his son, we of course became very aware of it. I hadn   t been that much, except for male counterparts worrying about their draft number, and were they going to need to go, and that sort of thing. I was pretty ignorant of stuff. I mean, this was kind of a cocoon, provincial sort of way of growing up.  Finchum When you were at OSU, during that time period too, any memories regarding   .  Cloyde Most of my memories   I mean, I think we had a couple of     Finchum Maybe protests?  Cloyde    yeah, protests, but we also had a racial protest at one, or some kind of problem at one stage, and I remember that very vividly. That sort of began to open my eyes to everybody didn   t have it so easy growing up. College was an amazing time for me just to learn about all the subjects one could study, and all the things there were in the world, as well as to learn about different kinds of people, and different religions, and to start to try to make sense of them. As I say, because I was reared so parochially and protected, and that kind of thing, it was probably the first time I really began to examine my value system, and to make conscious decisions rather than those with which I came. That was a real interesting time. I think sometimes you go through sort of an anger stage at,    How could I have been so unaware,    or,    How could I have just been made to think that,    or whatever, and learning to think for myself.  One of the people   and I know sometimes you talk to people about professors they remember. One of my earliest mentors, and certainly at OSU, was Dean Zelma Patchin. I don   t know if you got to know her or know her name, but she was first, when I was there, called the Dean of Women. Then they at least got rid of that name, and called it the Associate Dean of Student Affairs. She mainly had women   s kinds of things report to her. Dean Patchin was just savvy and with it, and a lot of fun, and she taught me that you could look at life differently. You could do some things that I   d thought you   d go straight to hell for doing, and actually you didn   t. I   m not talking bad things, I   m just talking about broadening one   s horizons. She was just   I guess it was the right time for me to be around a person like her.  17  I was fortunate that not only was she very involved in some of my organizations, but she also was chair of one or two university-wide committees, like search committees to hire new people, and I would be the student representative on those. Would have the opportunity to be in her home and watch her entertain, and watch her to know when she spoke, and when she didn   t because by now, I knew she had strong feelings and that kind of thing. It was a wonderful   she was a wonderful mentor to me. It was great. To the extent that when I was first   I had finally left OSU, and was in Dallas, working in banking, I thought,    Okay, I know I should join some organizations,    right. I thought about what Dean Patchin had been involved in, and she was involved in the American Association for University Women, and she was involved in Business and Professional Women   s Club. I joined those, which were great stepping off points for a lot of other things. I think back on that so fondly. She was just amazing.  Finchum We should back up and talk about how you came to go to OSU.  Cloyde Okay, I was always going to go to OSU because people in my family go to OSU. In fact, Frank and I were counting up, and we came up with twenty-six of us in the family who have gone to OSU, starting in the generation before mine. We have, I think from OSU, we have several PhDs in the family. I think one of them is from OSU. We have several masters. It   s an OSU family, big time. I   ve thought about that, but we just have always really loved it. They loved Oklahoma A M. I think it being a land grant university, and I think being in a very   I think the symbiotic relationship with Stillwater is a wonderful thing that adds to the feeling of just being at home, on the campus.  Still today, it just makes me happy to go on campus. It used to make my dad happy to go on campus. We all just feel a real love for it. All of our experiences have been totally different. I   m kind of the   well, along with Frank, probably the only ones who were really active in student government. Some of the others have been really active in athletics or other things. Everybody   s very different, but it was just always where we went to school. I remember as a young child thinking,    Farmers send their kids to OSU, and city people send their kids to OU.    I don   t know if I made that up myself trying to figure it out or what, but we   ve just always been very firmly OSU.  Finchum When you applied, you knew you were going to get in anyway?  Cloyde Yeah. Well, fortunately, I was at the top of my class, and so that was easy to be accepted. It was before all the anguish of applying to colleges. First of all, we couldn   t have afforded my going anywhere else I   m sure, except a local one. Even from Grandma on down it was like,    We go to the university,    because back then, the regional ones were called colleges, I think, not universities. 18  Finchum Normal schools   .  Cloyde Yeah, so we were going to go to OSU.  Finchum How did you get there the first day, they took you and dropped you off?  Cloyde They took me and dropped me off, and that was about it. We didn   t have very big dorms. We didn   t have a lot of clothes. They took me and dropped me off. I don   t remember much more than that, other than just seeing the room and meeting my roommate, and connecting with other friends I had who were going there, some of whom lived in the same dorm, which was Willard Hall. My aunt and my mother had lived in Willard Hall, so that was pretty incredible to me. Of course, being basically lazy, the reason I wanted Willard was because it was the most conveniently located, right, so that was really cool. They were known for having a good cafeteria, I think. I lived in Willard for three years.  Finchum The same room each year?  Cloyde The same wing, there were two different rooms I was between, I think 209 and 211, or something like that. It was great. It was such a wonderful group that we just happened to have there in Willard. Most of them pledged, I did not, I was an independent-independent, but when we were tapped for Mortar Board at the end of our junior year, it was   there were, I bet, half of the group had been in that group at Willard. We had the Panhellenic president, two or three house presidents, the RHA president, I was president of the Association of Women Students. We just had all of these people who had happened to be together that freshman year, which I thought was just so cool. Really just good, basic people, so it was fun.  Finchum Any incidents involving Theta Pond right there beside?  Cloyde Actually, no. I have no accidental dunkings, or falling in love, or any kind of stories from Theta Pond.  Finchum And were you there during the streaking, when streaking was popular?  Cloyde We did have, I think, a little bit of streaking, but not too much.  Finchum Panty raids?  Cloyde Yeah, there were panty raids. Although, I think I remember more being on alert for them, and then they   re not really occurring than actual occurrences.  Finchum Would you do your own laundry? 19  Cloyde Oh yes  We had a laundry down in the basement, so you   d carry your basket down the stairs, and do your own laundry. I   m sure we tried to cram as much as we could into it because you had to pay for it. Keep your own thing of soap. I think back,    I wonder if we ever washed our sheets?    Probably a couple of times during a semester, I don   t know. The thought of that now is really gross. That would   ve been extra money and extra effort, and you would   ve had to find the time when you weren   t going to like catch fifteen minutes or whatever. I don   t know about that.  Finchum I bet if you were used to changing them at home fairly regularly, you probably did.  Cloyde Probably did and just don   t remember it, yeah.  Finchum Do any ironing?  Cloyde Yeah, we did. Where was the iron and ironing board? I guess it was there with the laundry. Of course, because that was before polyester and other things, and we couldn   t afford to dry clean things. We must have ironed, but I don   t really remember that too much.  Finchum Would you go to dances?  Cloyde I didn   t really go to dances. That   s funny.  Finchum You like your music so well, I figured.  Cloyde Well, no. I guess I did. Oh, and early on, when I was there, one of the music professors had a group called Choralettes or something like that that was just women. We sang three-part music, a lot of sort of jazz, up-tempo things. We had to audition for it. I enjoyed that. I planned and directed our Spring Sing entry at least one year, maybe more than one, I don   t know. We did Hair, which was considered a little out there, but we thought that was pretty fun.  Finchum    We    meaning who, since you weren   t in a sorority?  Cloyde The rest of the dorm, the people who participated. I wonder about what   I was pretty active in stuff going on, so I think that   s what took a lot of my time. I remember   I don   t know if Mortar Board still has the calendars, but   well, probably not, now that we keep everything on the phone on a calendar. I used to have it, and it would always be filled in. I was doing something, who knows what all it was.  Finchum Visit   spend much time in the Library?  20  Cloyde Not too much, some time. It sort of   I guess I wasn   t a dedicated library person because it was mainly if somebody I was dating spent time in the library, then I did. I studied there, but I don   t remember lots and lots of time. I think I was actually a little intimidated by it. I think I had not been around   I mean, I had studied...it   s not the Dewey Decimal System, what   s the     Finchum Library of Congress?  Cloyde No, the system that you cataloged the books back in the old days. Anyway, whatever. I kind of studied it and knew that there was that way that books were found, but I think I was still a little intimidated about everything about it. Course, we had to be so quiet. Of course, you couldn   t have anything to eat or drink then, and certainly there were not computers, and so it was a different time.  Finchum Spent more time in the Student Union?  Cloyde Yes, more time in the Student Union. A group of us who were involved in student government and particularly the O   Colly   the person I mentioned, whose dad had been in Vietnam, and his girlfriend were good friends of mine and a couple of other people with them were all writers on the O   Colly, and so we had a group of us that spent a lot of time together. I   m sure hashing over every event that occurred on campus, and the importance of it and that kind of thing, probably making mountains out of many molehills.  Finchum Was the Hideaway Pizza there?  Cloyde Oh yes, that was special. That was very, very special to   like on Sunday night, when you ate someplace other than the dorm, to go in with somebody, and be able to order a small pizza and share it or something. That was big, that was really big. It was the original location too, so around the corner from where it is now.  Finchum I   m not sure where it was before. How often would you come back home during the semester?  Cloyde Not often, probably for three reasons. One, we were told we were going to college, and we weren   t coming home every weekend. That was just not why you went to college, right? Two, I didn   t have a car of course, and so I would catch a ride when I was going to come. Three, it was such a long distance. It was like three and a half hours on a good day, kind of. That was a long time out of a Friday and a Sunday, so not a lot, except for the holidays.  21  Finchum We should back up too, and say what was your major.  Cloyde Oh, my major was sociology. Don   t ask. I loved it, I loved that major. I think I had gone crazy when I first got to school. I started out in speech path. I learned there were all these majors, and I was so excited because at Cheyenne High School then, you didn   t really have choices. I mean, girls weren   t allowed to take FFA. I wouldn   t take home ec, so there weren   t just a lot   I wouldn   t take shorthand and stuff, so there weren   t a lot of choices. I get to campus and learn about all of these fascinating things, so I think I changed majors about twice a semester the first couple of years. I was in math, I was in music, I was in English, I was in who knows what else, family relations and child development. They don   t call it that now, but that   s what they called it. I was in a variety of things, and by then, I had gotten pretty active on campus.  The sociology professors were pretty good about giving you a little extra time off or fudging with you if you were busy involved in some of those activities. I thought,    That makes a lot of sense.    Plus, I was fascinated by it. I thought it was interesting learning about different peoples, and how they interacted and all that, so I thought,    Well, it would make sense for me to major in sociology.    Besides, I was going to get a master   s, so hey. I majored in sociology, and then was trying to discern whether I should get an MSW, a master   s of social work, or (and this was again because of Dean Patchin) be a director of student activities. I sort of was opting for being the director of student activities. I graduated a semester early in December, so I was hired to go be assistant head resident in Stout Hall, while I could take a couple courses and think about where I was going to go to graduate school.  Then they created a job for me at OSU at the Student Union. Winston Shindell was the director there, who grew up in, I call it a suburb of Cheyenne, Oklahoma. Little town named Durham, up northwest of here, that   s a wide spot in the road with a couple of churches, and a community building, and a store, sort of like a Quik Stop store. Winston was director of the Student Union, and he created this job, if I would stay there to do my master   s, called Programs and Promotions Assistant. I would be the advisor to Student Union Activities Board, and do like the films and all the programs there, and the art shows, in the Student Union. Was a fabulous, wonderful job,  450 a month. I remember I thought,    Okay, I   ll live on this,    so I stayed at OSU and got my master   s there.  Finchum In what?  Cloyde Student personnel and guidance for higher education, yes.  Finchum Then you got into banking. You   ll have to explain how that came about.  22  Cloyde All right. Well, I think all these things are so funny. They now have, let   s see, I think it   s called Camp Cowboy, the big things for incoming freshmen. I had planned the first ever Freshman Week. It was going to be like (not week) a couple of days before school started. Freshmen were going to be showing up, so four or five thousand, however many ever, and I had planned that with other people on campus. That was my primary responsibility, so I couldn   t go to Dallas until (and Dallas was the first choice) the middle of September. One of the reasons I wanted to go to Dallas was because that   s when community colleges were brand new. I had done a paper on it during my master   s, and I thought it was a fascinating concept, and I wanted to be one of the first in it. But by the time I was able to move, the schools had hired their staffs.  I took a couple of days off, and then decided that business would be the thing for me to do. Business was this theoretical concept, only I didn   t know anything. I didn   t know a debit from a credit. I had no business acumen or knowledge. I chose four businesses that stood out to me in downtown Dallas. I took the student off of my student personnel and guidance master   s, emphasized I   d been on some state Status of Women committees and on a statewide search that we had done there on campus. Dr. Kamm was very supportive. Anyway, so I kind of rearranged my resume, and went in, and had this spiel that it was 1974, companies were going to have to hire women in executive roles. They had never done that before, so A, the company would not know how to assimilate women, and B, the women were going to have no role models.  I was going to design this program to make it all work. A couple of companies were actually interested in that. I look back and think,    How na  ve,    but anyway, you can brazen your way through a lot. I went to the biggest bank, which was Republic Bank of Dallas. The assistant director of personnel, with whom I interviewed said,    I don   t think we have a job like this.    I said,    That   s fine, I understand,    and I left, but the head of personnel was calling when I got home, and said,    We do have a training program that we think you   d be great for. Will you interview for it?    I said,    Of course.    I went and spent the whole day interviewing with, I thought, really old, white men. They were probably in their forties. Now, they would be very young to me, but you get the picture. I thought,    Oh my,    and kept interviewing at the other places.  Fortunately, the bank made me a very nice offer to be in this training program. There was a lot going on underneath, but the bottom line was I would be the first woman hired in the training program. I was hired on the last day of the quarter, meeting a requirement for them, but would actually have people come up to me while I was in the training program, and say,    I didn   t think we hired women in this program.    I   d say,    Take a good look because you   ve got one now.    I have other more hair-curling stories that I 23  won   t commit to film, but I ended up loving it, and typically, the training program was rotation through all the areas of the bank. Then some you would have a longer tenure and so do a project, and others, you would just be there a week or two and learn what goes on there.  It was an eighteen-month, roughly, program. After about six or eight months, I just wanted to run something. One of my friends, who had also been in the training program several years before, was running some departments, one of which had not worked at all. I mean, it was just the bane of everybody   s existence. He said did I want to run it, and I said,    Sure.     He went to our boss, who I thought was just so senior then, he was a senior vice president, and said that he wanted to put me into it. John said he just wasn   t sure a woman could take that pressure, and so Bill, who wanted to hire me, said,    Just think of her as a soft man.    However, it worked. I   ve always believed get your foot in the door, however. I took over that department, and we cleaned it up, and it was a wonderful success.  The longer I was there, I would ask for something else to do because I wanted to learn and do more. I would be given something additional, but not something totally different, until it occurred to me that they really didn   t think this little girl from Oklahoma was probably ever going to leave. The two large banks in Dallas had an agreement that they didn   t hire away from each other. The other bank wanted me to resign, then they   d hire me, and I said,    If you don   t have what it takes to hire me outright   .    I love the arts, and I thought I needed to go to a big city that was a banking center. In those days, New York and Chicago were, so I was interviewing there, and fortunately had been on some US-wide committees about these areas that I ran. Was probably the only woman, or maybe there was another who did, so it was easy to stand out in the crowd. People were amiable to talking to me about coming.  While I was talking to them, a headhunter came to me on behalf of Crocker Bank in San Francisco. I ended up taking a job there, to which my folks said,    Well, at least it   s not New York,    (Laughs) so everything has a bright side. I went to San Francisco. It was a big change because where I had had a couple of ethnic groups in Dallas, there were fourteen in my first cadre of employees in San Francisco. Of course, things were just very different there. Plus, Dallas at that time was a unit banking state, meaning everything was pretty contained in a downtown location. California was a branch banking, so you had locations all over the place. Those were big differences, but I loved it. After about a year and a half, I was selected to do the research about and then possibly start another department in consulting about some new products banks had. Fortunately, that went very well for me, and then I got some additional responsibility.  24  About that time, a good friend had gone to First Interstate, and he knew me because I was, again, in these banking circles. He wanted me to join First Interstate to do some turnarounds of some of the departments, so we talked, and it seemed like a great deal to do. I tried to talk them into letting me stay in San Francisco because it   s San Francisco, but the headquarters was Los Angeles, and so they insisted I move there, which ended up being one of the most pleasant surprises of my life. Having lived in Dallas and San Francisco, I always just said,    Well, I   ll never live in Houston or Los Angeles.    Living in Los Angeles has been just a real pleasure. San Francisco can tend to be sort of provincial, and LA, everybody came from somewhere else, so it   s very easy to assimilate. First Interstate was a great company for me. I was allowed to start up a bunch of things, to run a lot of departments, to be the first, which I really like to do.  Probably one of the most crowning things there was I was on the managing committee of the bank and selected to put the first department together that went across all of First Interstate lines. First Interstate had been grandfathered when interstate banking laws went into place originally. Most banks could not have locations in other states, but First Interstate had been grandfathered with thirteen states, so we had kind of operated independent banks and then sort of regional. Then we were starting to really centralize. This was a few years before interstate banking happened throughout the country. I did the first department and put it together, which was fun and rewarding. I had a great staff, offices all over the country. Did not travel, part or all, of two weeks those last two years. It was so fun, and I had such a strong team. It was just a great experience.  Finchum When did you sleep? (Laughs)  Cloyde I didn   t sleep much, which I now tell people you must do. I   m a real proponent of don   t be unhealthy like I was. I don   t think it   s smart, but that   s what I did.  Finchum What did you do to destress? I mean, you had to have a little bit of stress during that.  Cloyde No, there was a lot of stress. When I first started traveling, my client base was always like the Fortune One Thousand. When I first started traveling back at the other bank so much of the time, I loved the arts, so I first would make it a point to go to museums every place. I like zoos, so then I had the list of the top twenty zoos in the US, and so I   d go to the zoos. In New York particularly, and in Chicago, I would always see a lot of theater, so I guess I did those things. I will tell you, I got back from a sales trip. This was when I was still in San Francisco, and I think because there is no immediate gratification in that kind of job, you   re calling, and you   re hoping they will take what you want, but sometimes they need to get to know you, and that 25  kind of thing. I caught myself, on Friday afternoon, probably waiting for the plane home, putting together a dinner party.  I mean, I would make homemade bread and homemade meringue pies, and all this kind of thing, and get like six or eight together for a dinner party at my house on Saturday night. It became clear to me I was doing this for immediate gratification, unlike I got on the road all week. I always had a large group of friends too, and like I say, I always loved to read. During that time, I didn   t read many books and I usually do read, have read books and now again do. Of course, it was in those workaholic days that I didn   t practice the piano, and so that kind of went by the wayside. Mainly, I worked. Mainly, I worked ten or twelve-hour days, sometimes more. You come home, and you eat and take care of the basics, or you   re on the road.  My schedule, typically, on the road, would be a client breakfast and then meetings all the way through it. Sometimes entertaining in the evening, sometimes even flying after that. I said,    It is not a good thing to check in and out of a hotel with the same clerk at the desk.    I was pretty crazy during those times, but I loved it. In eighty, ninety      96, First Interstate was bought by Wells Fargo. I had had breast cancer and extensive treatment a few years earlier, and still traveled the whole time. Six months of chemo, two months of radiation, and so I thought I should take a little time off. I took six months off, and we spent it with family.  Then my boss, who was the CEO of First Interstate, took a job at the largest savings and loan to sort of make it into a bank, and said he needed me to come. I did and brought all my people. This was the nice thing about staying in LA is I was able to reemploy all my staff. Then we sold that because the technology investment was going to be so huge that we decided not to do it, so we sold it. I took all these people and went to what was then a midsize bank in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles City National Bank, and we completely rebuilt the infrastructure of it and changed things.  I, through my career, have prided myself in addition to being like first in a job and doing turnarounds as to really growing people. That   s what I love, managing people, so took this whole cadre again, but told my direct reports that we were going to switch around what they were responsible for so they would be prepared to do my job or another similar job at their next time. Then retired from there in 2006, which my boss called a sabbatical until 2007, and then finally was really gone from there.  Then in 2008, in a weak moment with my former boss and some other people, we decided   in a weak moment for me   we decided to start a bank. Now, this was my first experience at starting a bank. I had started lots of departments, but not a bank. I hadn   t worked in a small bank, and this was obviously going to be small because we were starting it. During that 2008-26  2009 terrible economic time, we went to Wall Street, the four of us, and raised 400 million dollars to start it, which was amazing. We started it, got it off the ground, it   s running really well, and I was, again, working like crazy. In, probably eleven, 2011, said now I was really retiring and did, so that   s just a brief history of my career.  Finchum A lot of firsts.  Cloyde Yes, that   s what I loved.  Finchum A lot of leadership experience, and you really can   t   some of it you might be able to relate back to your sociology classes.  Cloyde A lot of it. I really maintained that I was better prepared than a lot of business majors because of   some of it you come with, and some of it you pick up in class, but being able to understand why people do things the way they do sometimes and that sort of thing. I think it was incredibly beneficial.  Finchum I would think in some negotiations, too, it might be.  Cloyde Yes, so I was always grateful for it. I thought it prepared me very well.  Finchum Quite a contrast, from here to there.  Cloyde It   s a big contrast. Probably   well, when I was walking around streets of New York, calling on clients, and living in San Francisco and Los Angeles, big contrast, but particularly when I was at the bank that was headquartered in Beverly Hills. Beverly Hills can be a very materialistic, surface kind of place, and I was always so grateful for this grounding. That I could come back here, and see people I   ve known forever, and who have known me forever, and just play with the kids, and plan trips with them, and do wonderful things like that. I   ve always been very grateful. I   m grateful for a wonderful career that I loved every minute of, but I   m also grateful that I have the strong family and the strong roots that I do.  Finchum Did you get married along the way?  Cloyde I was married for seven years, actually from before the second degree at OSU through part of the time in Dallas. We were divorced, and I haven   t married since then.  Finchum You   ve been busy. Coming from Cheyenne, when you would come back home, they didn   t perceive you as having gotten too big for your britches, that phrase that people use?  27  Cloyde I guess not, and I was always so happy to be here, and to see people and everything.  Finchum Humble is the word that comes to mind.  Cloyde I guess. I don   t think of myself as particularly humble, but I was just always glad to be here.  Finchum So you own a place in LA now?  Cloyde Yes, I do.  Finchum Do you miss it when you   re here?  Cloyde I was here for six and a half weeks just a few weeks ago. I had three different sets of meetings at OSU, and my niece, who keeps our eighteen- month -old grandnephew, had hip replacement. I was pinch hitting to help out during that time, which was wonderful. I said,    I have never, in one of my twelve or fourteen-hour days, I had never been as tired as keeping a child that age from seven thirty in the morning until four thirty in the afternoon.    It was so wonderful and so fun, so   what was it that you asked me, I   m off my train of thought about the coming back.  Finchum Did you miss   when you   re here, do you miss it there?  Cloyde Okay, here   s what I miss. I miss my friends. I   m very involved with UCLA women   s basketball. I mentor the coach. I   m very involved with my church, and we have a big building project going on, and I have other things with which I   m involved. It   s hard to do some of those long distance. I   m mentoring one of the basketball players and some other things, so it   s hard to do those long distance. I miss them, and I miss just my favorite haunts to go eat, and shop, and that kind of thing. You cannot just run downtown, or even to the next town, and find anything you need here. I think one of my favorite things, particularly if there   s some ballgame on that I want to see, is being able to order in really good food. There   s this company called Gourmet Courier, and they deliver from some of the best restaurants in LA and Beverly Hills. I can order food in if I don   t want to go out, or I can drive fifteen minutes and be in fabulous places.  In LA, you   re twenty minutes from the ocean and thirty minutes from mountains, so it   s just an extraordinary place to live. The theater   s great, the symphony   s great, the museums are great, the athletics are great, and particularly if you   re a UCLA fan, as I am. There are more things to attend that are broadening and enlightening than you can possibly do, and I have really good friends there. My book club came to Cheyenne a couple of years after we had completed adding on to the house, and that was really fun, so 28  these were all city-slickers. We did things like driving the tractor, and went to the museums downtown, the one-room schoolhouse, and all of that kind of thing. They thoroughly loved it and loved the hospitality, but I miss them. We have a book club, and I miss that when I   m here. I look at it is how very fortunate to have two homes that I really love to be in. To miss the one when I   m at the other, it   s just a real blessing to be able to say that.  Finchum Long term, do you   .  Cloyde I don   t know.  Finchum You don   t want to have to pick. (Laughs)  Cloyde No, I can   t imagine being elderly and probably not being closer to some family. However, I also can   t imagine the time when I won   t want to have all of the things available to me that I have in LA. It   ll be interesting to see. I just don   t try to plan it.  Finchum So you   re a breast cancer survivor?  Cloyde Twice, yes. In 1992, which I was pretty young and the treatments were still pretty archaic then, and that   s when I worked full-time too. Just crazy, two surgeries, six months of chemo, and two of radiation. Then again, four years ago, twenty years to the day almost that I had first had it, I had another breast cancer, which was a different cancer. Had to do mastectomy and reconstruction and all that, but fortunately did not have to do chemo, except for the ongoing drug that one takes, and so was very fortunate in that.  Finchum Those happened out of Oklahoma?  Cloyde Yes, yeah very much. I was at UCLA, and   no, both in California, just the very best care, wonderful care. One of the organizations that I   m active in is at UCLA, and we have a women   s health center there, and we started an executive women   s advisory group about ten or twelve years ago, where we all commit to so much a year, and it goes to research. Then we invite proposals from all over the university, not just the med school, and then we grant four or five grants. Which is like seed grants, so that enough research can be done to then go to NIH  National Institute of Health  and get really big ones. One of the reasons I was so interested in doing that is because I was horrified, not quite as much now as I was then because it   s getting a little better, but there was precious little research done on women   s health. It was always just men   s research studies and then applied to women, and usually that is incorrect because the bodies don   t operate the same way.  We were particularly focused on studies about women   s health. Then I wanted study across the silos of medicine because one of my 29  chemotherapies, which was the strongest I could do, so I would   ve done it again, but it is harmful to one   s heart. We have a family history of heart stuff. I just think there needs to be more cross-fertilization between the study, between the parts of medicine, and so we help contribute to that. That   s very gratifying. We   ve done some really good work there. Along the way, I   ve helped mentor the woman who runs it, who is brilliant. Grew up in Kansas, and heads the woman   s health center, is also my physician, and is on national committees on different health things but didn   t know a lot about the business side, and so I   ve been able to help on that a lot of the time. It   s just been very gratifying.  Finchum And you mentor a coach?  Cloyde Yes, the woman   s head basketball coach at UCLA.  Finchum How did that come about?  Cloyde Well, this is very interesting. Her name is Cori Close, and she is extraordinary, and when I heard she was coming, we had needed   we had a coach there, but was crazy, not crazy about, but thought a lot of, who was very charismatic. She suddenly got an offer to go back to the Southeast Conference, which was home. Made sense, but a lot of people were very put out with her because she was just beginning to build the program. Cori was hired, and I hadn   t met her yet, but I heard that she was an accolade of John Wooden, whom I just think he was amazing. She also was coming back, she had done her graduate work at UCLA. I was very concerned that people would take out on Cori their anger at her predecessor. I met her very early on, had a reception at my house so that others could meet her and learn who she was. I knew they   d fall in love with her, so we became good friends from the very beginning.  A year or so into her tenure, I would meet with her occasionally, I was meeting with her, and I said,    You know, Cori, I and my little old lady friends are retired, and had pretty amazing careers.    One was general counsel at Pepperdine, just really cool backgrounds. I said,    If there is any way we can mentor the girls, or help in some way, they   d be glad to.    She looked at me, and said,    Will you mentor me?    I said,    Are you serious?    She goes,    Yeah, I   m really serious because how to operate in a large organization, juggling the managing of staff,    which is never large enough in an environment like that, and the team and all that. I told her,    Of course, it would be my distinct pleasure,    and so have done that. It is so rewarding and so much fun. I love these kids and want to see them do as well as they can. The goal of the program is to build strong, confident women for the world after basketball, and after college, and that kind of thing.  30  It   s exactly what I support, and we have a good time. I travel a lot with the team. In fact, they   re going for their every four years international trip to Australia in August, and I   ll be going with them on that, which should be a lot of fun. Usually we do one   we emphasize giving back a lot, and since that   s a personal thing of mine, it   s a really good fit. They   ve done a number of these, going into underprivileged schools, and the players and coaches actually sit across from the children, one by one, and wash their feet and put new socks and shoes on everyone. You can imagine the size of the project the director of operations has in like getting everyone   s shoe size before they get there. I think we   ll do some kind of project like that, maybe in an aboriginal community while we   re there, and that will be very, very special. It   s just a great thing to be able to do.  Finchum How did you get interested in basketball though?  Cloyde Okay. Well, this is a basketball family that I   m a part of. I   m just the exception to being a klutz and uncoordinated. As I said, my brother played college ball. Barbara played for a couple of years at OSU. It was before Title IX, so they didn   t have the good, or I guess, serious or in-depth programs that they do now, but she played there. My nieces and nephew, Michael, and then he was a coach too, then the grandnieces, they   ve all played, and we have others in the family. When I quit traveling so much, so now what, ten or fifteen years ago, I think I had been back here. One of the cousin   s daughter had played college ball, and so I had traveled here and there to see her play. I thought,    Isn   t it silly that I don   t go to any college basketball games?    Absolutely because I   m two miles from UCLA, and so I began going. Some friends and I bought season tickets.  This is a funny story, so the first game I go to, I see people I know, but one of them is this guy named Don Morrison, who was at that time, the UCLA rep to NCAA Sports. He was also a professor emeritus in the business school and all this, but he also was on a committee of mine at church, so we had this overlap. Don sees me and said    Oh, fresh meat for the women   s basketball program     He immediately got me hooked up with the coach. It sort of went from there, it   s kind of grown, and particularly with Cori, it   s really grown.  Now I certainly follow   a couple years ago, Barbara and I went to the women   s Final Four, even though we weren   t in it, but it was in New Orleans. It was just a fun thing to do, and something that we could do together. Yeah, we follow it. This year, we had a great year for UCLA basketball. As soon as it was over, I was involved in college baseball because Barbara   s grandson was a left-hand pitcher at the University of Louisville. He just   well, he was named the pitcher of the year for the ACC, and he was just drafted by the Atlanta Braves, and is now at training camp.  31  Finchum Road trip.  Cloyde We   ve been following   yeah, big road trip. I always go on road trips to see him play in both Boston and Wake Forest, after basketball ended, at the end of March, first of April. Now we   ll be following him in that career and with hopes that he will move up and enjoy it. That   s been his goal since he was seven or eight years old, so what an amazing and wonderful thing.  Finchum Maybe he   ll end up in Dodgers, right?  Cloyde Yeah, the Dodgers. Some of my friends, the same book club group, were very disturbed that the Dodgers did not recruit him, but I think the Braves had their eye on him.  Finchum At least that   s an easy airport to fly in and out of.  Cloyde Yeah, it is. He won   t be in Atlanta for a while because they have all these farm teams, and I   m just learning the nomenclature. See me in a year, and I   ll be able to really regale you with all that kind of stuff.  Finchum Well, follow the OSU baseball too?  Cloyde I know, we   re so excited that they   re in the World Series. In fact, we were talking about what time is the game tonight because we   ll all be watching that. The whole house is OSU during the football games, and we have our OSU platters with food out and all that. We   re very big on all the sports and the basketball. I   m very hopeful and excited about the new men   s basketball coach. I just have really high hopes for that, and hope that the women   s continue to do so well. That this year, finally, I will be in Stillwater during a women   s game. Cori keeps trying to schedule something in Oklahoma, but we haven   t been able to do it yet. That   ll be fun if we ever can.  Let me think, maybe four years ago, when I was first working with her, UCLA women came to OU for a game. Of course, I said   my grandniece, who was then still in high school, the coach, the family, everybody had to come, had UCLA attire for everyone, and we go to the game. People are being so nice to us, and we kept going, my brother, and my nephew, and I, kept saying,    Why are people being so nice,    because we weren   t accustomed to that. Then it donned on us because we were wearing blue, and not orange, (laughter) so that was a pretty funny story, but whatever. It   s a lot of fun, and we just love it.  Finchum Well, with your connection to UCLA, you still have connections with OSU. You   re on the, I have it written down, you   re on the board of what?  Cloyde Board of Trustees of the Foundation. 32  Finchum Stay busy with that?  Cloyde Yes, and that   s, I think, a really important thing.  Finchum And the Women for OSU Council?  Cloyde Women for OSU, and I don   t know if you know about Women for OSU. Often, I   m not big on organizations for women because I think it should just be for whomever. Early on in my business career, I thought that really sat women back, to be segregated, so I would not allow women who worked for me to do that. Women for OSU is like Women in Philanthropy at UCLA, which I   m also involved in, and the whole goal is to raise money for scholarships for students. I   m for anything that is going to give students a better chance, or allow a student who might not otherwise be able to go to school. That   s what Women for OSU does, but the most exciting part to me is, I always want to touch the students. I want to have opportunity to spend time with students, and we are starting a class on philanthropy for students. It   s going to be a class, and Vice Provost Pam Fry, is it vice provost? I get the university titles mixed up, or vice chancellor, I think. Anyway. Sorry, Pam.  She and I have been working on this and it   s become a committee of the Women for OSU. We   ll start a class, we think, next spring semester that   s philanthropy, and how to do it, and what it is. That will give the students the summer to work on a project, and I was telling the trustees the other day, that   ll be a great chance for us to mentor students. The Women for OSU members are very anxious to be able to mentor students and hopefully help know what doors to open or where you can get something. I   m really excited about that, both because I think it   s so worthwhile   I wish I had known more about philanthropy when I got out of school and started working with organizations. I think that will be useful, and I think it will also be just another way for students to be involved and to meet alums, who could probably help them along the way at some point. We   re just really jazzed about that, that   s going to be cool.  Finchum You   ll be making a few trips back for that.  Cloyde I will. In fact, I said   well, Pam and I have laughed that the instructors will be cheap, so it won   t take much to put it on. It will involve   we   ll work out when I need to be here and that kind of thing. I think it   s going to be so fun, and I think we   re going to have a lot of help doing it, so we   re excited about that. I   m also involved with President   s Fellows, which we felt was a very necessary thing, so that Burns could have a pool of money for needs he sees that don   t otherwise get funded, whether it   s a student who might be about to drop out of school, or just something that   s very needed on campus. I   m 33  really happy to support him because I think he and Ann have been so fabulous for OSU.  Finchum They can   t retire.  Cloyde I know. That   s what I keep saying. (Laughs)  Finchum I mean, they   ve been great.  Cloyde They are just fabulous.  Finchum Going on ten years. Well, I think he started in 2008 or    07, somewhere in there.  Cloyde Did he? Time goes so fast, I lose track.  Finchum Pushing ten years. Your loyalty is still to the Big Orange     Cloyde It is, very much.  Finchum    and a lot of people are. Do you have any idea why, what is it about OSU that creates that strong  loyalty ?  Cloyde Well, I think it goes back to what I was talking about earlier. It is such a feeling of home, it   s just   it   s a feeling of this is a good place, and it   s a place that will help me learn and grow. I think a lot of people, like myself, had a good experience there, and so we want to help other kids have good experiences, especially with all the challenges we have in the world today. I think the more we can know about each other, religions, and ethnicities, and value systems, I just think it has to be helpful, and particularly when Oklahoma goes through a time like now. When it   s negatively impacted by the energy industry, I think it   s just really good to have strong supporters that know this is something that should go on, and can go on, and we want it to go on, not only for people in our own families, but for other people in Oklahoma, in other places, who decide to come here. It   s kind of like just this island or this Mecca of good.  Finchum Campus is very pretty. Do you have a favorite spot?  Cloyde Favorite spot   well, it   s hard to beat the Formal Gardens, just to be able to see the Formal Gardens. I guess the Student Union will always be my favorite spot, even though it   s so changed and so different. It   s still an amazing place.  Finchum Not Willard Hall?  34  Cloyde No, not since it   s the education department headquarters now. It isn   t as conducive as running in and flopping down on a sofa or something.  Finchum The parlor   s probably similar to what it was.  Cloyde Yeah, it is actually. It is actually pretty similar.  Finchum The Student Union would   ve had the bowling alley when you were there.  Cloyde It did.  Finchum I wish they   d bring that back. I think students would enjoy doing that.  Cloyde I think that was a really neat thing. I guess they felt they needed that space for other     Finchum It   s still a pretty spot. Then the Library   s a pretty spot too.  Cloyde The Library is. Sorry, I didn   t choose that, (laughter) but yeah, it is.  Finchum Overall, it   s pretty. The boot that they   ve done, the topiary boot and the hat, it   s very nice. I keep thinking,    What   s next?     Cloyde I think the grounds crew is amazing.  Finchum The Hargises had something to do with that.  Cloyde They did, and I   m so excited about the new performing arts building. That   s going to be extraordinary. We got the brochure at the meeting last week about it, and it just looks fabulous.  Finchum More reason to come back.  Cloyde Yeah, and to bring world renowned symphonies and Broadway plays to Stillwater is just something very special. I certainly remember going to New York for the first time for my first Broadway play, and it   ll be nice to expose more people to that kind of thing.  Finchum So have you seen Hamilton?  Cloyde No, and I   m dying to see it. I think I   m probably going to end up just anteing up because I want to see it. I was actually   there is a certain point about Weatherford, when one is driving west from Oklahoma City or Stillwater, where you can no longer get OSU   s public radio station. It   s beyond the reach. I was listening to Hamilton coming out Friday night after the meeting and thinking,    This is such exciting music.    Plus, it   s a great history lesson, 35  too. Actually our book club has decided, despite the length, that we will read Hamilton. We   re going to talk about it in March or sometime in first quarter, so that we can continue our other books, and read a few chapters along, and be ready for it.  Finchum That   s on my list, too. I haven   t read it either.  Cloyde I love to hold books, and I seldom will read them on my iPad, but that one I   m going to put on electronically because I think carrying it about will be just a little too much.  Finchum Having a book, you can   t beat it.  Cloyde Yeah, I know. I love having a book.  Finchum Do you have a favorite childhood memory, and then we   ll wrap it up.  Cloyde I   ve spoken in general about our holidays and how special those were. I guess one, and I grew out of it too early, but I   ve always thought back on it and loved it, is just going to feed the cattle after school. Just being out in the country, and having the   they would see the pickup, and know food was coming, and follow along behind it, and learning a little bit about the cycle of life, and where we got our food. Things that I think too many children today don   t have a clue about, so I guess it would be a generalized memory of just going and doing those things. It   s really not any of the performances I did, or things like that, was being with family and being in the country.  Finchum Where do you consider home?  Cloyde LA. Although I always say, when I   m coming here,    I   m going home,    or when I   m there,    I   ll be home on this day,    so it   s a close   .  Finchum Home A and Home B.  Cloyde Yeah, certainly, but LA probably because I have lived there so long.  Finchum From 19     Cloyde Eighty-four.  Finchum Oh, from    84.  Cloyde Yeah, and before that was San Francisco for four years, so I   ve been in California a long time. Thirty-seven years, that   s a long time.  Finchum I   m glad you came back and met with me today. 36  Cloyde Thank you, it was just a pleasure to do it.  Finchum Fascinating stories, a good role model.  Cloyde Thank you.  Finchum You can rip off some leadership skills here.  Cloyde I love everything about leadership. We didn   t have time really to talk about the kids, but I   m going to tell you about this one program I have, that started when there were only about four or five greats, as I call them, the nieces and nephews. It started with Frank and Linda   s kids because they   re the oldest of that generation. I promised them that when they graduated from the eighth grade, we would go on a trip in the US, and when they graduate from high school, a trip in the world.  We have such fun because there is the whole planning and anticipating, and    Where do I want to go?    Then I get them to myself for the trip, which is extraordinary. One of the things we   ve done with some of the art here in the house is bring art from the different countries. Of course, there   s a lot of European stuff because we go there a lot, but those are Australian pictures, and there   s some Australian baskets and things. It   s really fun to make this house about our experiences together too, which is really neat.  Finchum Makes home for them.  Cloyde It does, so I just wanted to mention that.  Finchum They get to choose where you take them?  Cloyde Yes. I can veto third-world countries or other places, but yes, they may choose.  Finchum And they stay a week or two weeks?  Cloyde A week in the eighth grade and two weeks in high school.  Finchum Any coming up?  Cloyde Let   s see, next year, I have one eighth, and then the following year, I think I have both an eighth and a high school, and the following year, two high schools. No one has definitively said yet. It   s like any new thing. You have to take it out, talk about it, think about it, bounce it off, and then decide if that   s really what you want to do.  37  Finchum Is one of the requirements that it   s just you and them, so if you have two in one year, they wouldn   t necessarily have to go together?  Cloyde No, they don   t have to go together. Although, one of Barbara   s grandsons and Larry   s granddaughters graduated from the eighth grade at the same time two years ago, and I told them they could have two weeks if they went together. They had a ball, so now they   re talking about doing the senior year together, which would really be fun.  Finchum They   d get four weeks then.  Cloyde Yeah, they got   well, I don   t know if I   m going to do four weeks. I probably would die with that, but we   ll consider other options. Yeah, they get to choose and we   ll just see.  Finchum Are they headed toward OSU, too, when they graduate, possibly?  Cloyde Barbara   s grandchildren, probably more Kentucky, since that   s where they live. In fact, she has two, and a son and a grandson-in-law, all three of them are UK grads, and Andrew will now be University of Louisville. I think the others will probably go to Kentucky too. Her sons went to University of Kentucky, but then the younger one did his PhD, and his wife graduated from OSU, so some enter that way. Well, I have a grandniece who   s there now. Lives in Stout, rooms with Pam Fry   s daughter, so it   s kind of fun. Her younger sister   I think she might want to go someplace further, so it   s going to be interesting to see. I, of course, say,    Well, there is UCLA,    but I think it   s like,    Further and not where I have family members,    but we   ll see when it gets the real time.  Finchum UCLA is a nice campus too.  Cloyde It   s a great campus, it   s wonderful.  Finchum Kind of hard to get into, isn   t it?  Cloyde It   s not hard to get into if you know LA. Oh, hard to get accepted   impossible. It has more applicants than any other university.  Finchum But she   s got connections.  Cloyde Yeah. (Laughs) I don   t think these connections would probably do much there.  Finchum Maybe.  38  Cloyde They are interested in diversity, so people from little towns, who have activities and good grades, it   s a useful thing.  Finchum So coming from Cheyenne   s been a good thing?  Cloyde Very good thing.  Finchum Graduating from OSU   s been a good thing     Cloyde Yes.  Finchum    and living in LA has too, so pretty good life, sounds like.  Cloyde It   s a very good life. I   m totally blessed, happy to be healthy and be here.  Finchum And it started in this little town of 830, I think, is what they said?  Cloyde Yeah, but it was a thousand when I was a kid. Yeah, that   s exactly where it started, on this hill, in the other part of the house, where we grew up.  Finchum I appreciate you welcoming me into your home today, thank you.  Cloyde Well, I was happy too, seemed to make the most sense.  -------  -------
