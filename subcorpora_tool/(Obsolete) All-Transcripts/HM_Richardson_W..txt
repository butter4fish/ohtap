Speaker 1: Before we go into depth there are five lightweight questions we always ask as kind of a warm up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They only require a short answer. The first one is do you have a favorite food?

Speaker 2: Monte Carlo [Monaco].
Speaker 1: All right. And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I think I do, but I just can't recall it at this moment. I'm trying to think what I am known for. People, people refer--I think sometimes I say, "My, my, my, my, my." Really it's kind of like an exclamation of something that is beyond words, or beyond description.
Story_ID: 642072
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [William F. Richardson, Sr.] side but separately, then we'll put them together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Amanda Florine, Amanda, A-M-A-N-D-A, Florine, F-L-O-R-I-N-E, Richardson--Ellison, Ellison, E-L-L-I-S-O-N [Amanda Ellison Richardson].
Speaker 1: Okay and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was--her birth--her date of birth is April 28th, 1926 and she was born in Newport News, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family? How, how far back can you trace them and what were they were doing in history?
Speaker 2: I, I--my mother's father, as far as I can go back, they, they were born--or they came from Abbeville, South Carolina to Newport News. My grandfather was--had five brothers and all of them--all but one were ministers, but they--one of them didn't become a minister until later years. But ultimately all five of them were ministers. And my grandfather, not only was he a minister but he was an entrepreneur 'cause he--in Newport News he had a bus company, started a bus company in Newport News and he was always rather entrepreneurial in his spirit. He--when I came to know him they then--they moved from Newport News to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] early on, and I was born in Philadelphia. So when I came to know him, he was--one of the things I remember was he had a church in Jersey, in Glassboro, New Jersey where he pastored, a Methodist church, a C.M.E. church. And after some time in the C.M.E. denomination, he decided to go independent. But I also remember that on Saturdays he had a hustler truck where he sold vegetables from, and we as children would love to get on the truck and go help sell tomatoes and potatoes and water- things he'd bring from the country in Jersey to Philadelphia and we would participate with him. So my grandfather was a--his name was Wade, Wade Clifton Ellison [Wade Ellison].
Speaker 1: Wade?
Speaker 2: Clifton.
Speaker 1: Clifton.
Speaker 2: Yeah, W.C. Ellison, and he was a minister even 'til--right up until the end of his life. He had a church in Jersey which became an independent church, he stayed there and then he moved back to Philadelphia with one of his daughters at the end of his life and then on to a nursing home.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story--now he was in the C.M.E. church in the beginning?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was the family--was that the traditional church for the rest of the others too?
Speaker 2: No I think--it might have been a transfer after he'd gotten to Philadelphia or to New Jersey, 'cause the New Jersey conference--New Jersey C.M.E. church, which was at that time was not called Christian Methodist Episcopal, it was called Colored Methodist Episcopal. And he probably transferred to that denomination, I'm not sure. But you have to understand that most of the African Americans, as you well understand, in South Carolina, were A.M.E.'s [African Methodist Episcopal] and my parents--my mother's roots were in the A.M.E. church. So my grandfather was one in South Carolina, he was more than likely an A.M.E. He became a C.M.E. when he took the responsibility--but he was for years in the A.M.E. church in the conference. So my mother grew up as an A.M.E. in Philadelphia. She was a member of Mount Pisgah A.M.E. Church there in West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. My mother had--you want me to talk about my mother's family?
Speaker 1: Yes, I have just one more question about your grandfather, do you know what happened in--'cause I know the C.M.E. and the A.M.E. are organized differently than say the Baptist church.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So what--do you know what happened to make him independent (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Independent?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well (cough), yeah I do know the story. He, he was very good--he and his brothers at restoring churches, right. So within the conference, he literally went and took over churches that were failing and built them up. He built them physically; he was a carpenter, handyman whatever. So he--and so the bishops kept moving him and finally one day he decided that, "I'm not, I'm not going to move no more, I'm not gonna--you know, I build up the church then you all move me to another--," you know. So he didn't want to do that any longer, so that's when he became an independent.
Story_ID: 642073
Speaker 1: Tell me about the rest of the story of your mother's family.
Speaker 2: And so my mother [Amanda Ellison Richardson] she married my fa- grandmother was my, my father's, my grandfather's wife and my mother--mother's mother--my grandmother. Her name was Mattie Clinkseale [Mattie Clinkseale Ellison], Clinkseale.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Clink--
Speaker 2: C-L-I-N-K-S-E-A-L-E, Mattie Clinkseale, and that's--I don't know a whole lot more about that. I know that she was from Abbeville [South Carolina] as well. So they got married and they moved to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] about--my mother, my mother had four sisters and one brother. The brother was next to the youngest and he died at thirty-three. He was kill- his name was Peter Mac Ellison [Peter Ellison] and he was killed in New York [New York] in a police station in--while incarcerated, he was arrested and incarcerated. He lived in Boston [Massachusetts], but he came down to New York for whatever reason and they killed him.
Speaker 1: Is it--there--I mean were there extenuating circumstances?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were extenuating circumstances, we don't know, you know back there--so that's the--my goodness that was when I was young, so that's over fifty years ago. And the issues around African American treatment by the police in New York fifty years ago, many things went unanswered and were not accountable and this was one of the cases with him.
Speaker 1: Okay. About what year did your mother's family move to Philadelphia? How old was she you think when--?
Speaker 2: She was very young, my mother must have been about--she remembers very little of it, so she must have been five or six. No more than that because she remembered the bus company. So maybe, maybe she was twelve, twelve or thirteen.
Speaker 1: Yeah, by the way what was the name of the bus company?
Speaker 2: I don't know the name of the bus company, I really don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So she had a brother that was killed mysteriously in a New York City police station. Now, was your grandfather [Wade Ellison] an activist minister?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think he was activist in the sense of being a voice for social justice, but activist in the sense of building the institution of the church. My contention is the very existence of the black church provided an activist presence in the black community. Even if, even if the theological posture of the pastor was not advocacy. Just the institutional presence was advocating because of the--it said to the forces and the systems that there's a presence--there's a united presence, there's a connected presence, there's a potential advocacy presence. So the institution of the church is a very--I think the existence of the African American church whether it was theological, conservative or liberal made a diff- made a difference in terms of how aggressive racism was. I think racism could have been a lot--as bad as it was, it could have been much worse without the presence of the church, just the presence of the church. What it reminded, what it reminded--its presence reminded the oppressor of his own religious--how he was in juxtaposition against his own faith foundations to be engaged in racism. So I think there's a silent advocacy by the institution of the church. So my grandfather was not social justice driven, but he was the church, he was the black church in terms of what I would call old style preacher. Knowledgeable but not seminary trained, not college trained. He had gone to some schools but not the way we view them today.
Story_ID: 642074
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Amanda Ellison Richardson]--are there, is there any stories about the ancestors on your mother's side of the family that go back to the days of emancipation or Reconstruction?
Speaker 2: My mother's side, I never heard that. I don't know how familiar she was with it. My father [William F. Richardson, Sr.] was born in--well, we haven't talked about my father yet.
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's just finish up with your mother (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah. Well, my mother never--she, she never--I can't recall any stories of their--I really don't get--really didn't get much detail of the Abbeville, South Carolina presence. She mostly remembered Newport News [Virginia] and that's where I got the bus, the bus company story, but I don't recall her ever talking about or that she was even knowledgeable of the South Carolina period.
Speaker 1: Is it your sense that your family was enslaved in the South?
Speaker 2: Oh no question about that. There's that sense that they were enslaved, I just don't know the lineage and the details would be worth me investigating.
Speaker 1: So, there were no stories that were passed down about their lineage?
Speaker 2: No. The only thing that kind of humorously was passed on by my mother and her cousin, which is Mary Atkinson [ph.]. Mary Atkinson is like a sister to my mother and they came from the same family roots. And they used to tease about that the old women would suffer from senility, dementia, and that they could sit on the porch and they'd shoot at you (laughter). They used to laugh about it, and so they used to laugh and joke about it my mother and her cousin. Today my mother is in the nursing home with dementia. My cousin it didn't affect her, but they kind of knew that was in their DNA that--and they used to laugh when they'd talk about the aunts that used to sit on the porch and shoot people, shoot at people, fortunately they didn't shoot anyone. But that's the only kind of little snippet I have out of that period.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Now did your mother have--did she have a chance to finish school in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Yeah my mother, my mother went to West Philadelphia High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and graduated and so did I. I subsequently went to West Philadelphia High School. (Cough) So she finished high school, she then went to school for--to be a cosmetologist, a beautician, and she opened her own business. I don't remember my mother--a period when my mother didn't have her own beauty shop. She had a beauty shop in West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] at 43rd [Street] and Ogden Street, it was called Amanda's Beauty Bar and it was attached to our home. So she was able to raise us and still do her business, her beauty shop business. And it was an interesting insight into the community from the standpoint of being able to see the people come through and pass and so forth. So my mother did that for all of her working life, she was a beautician. She had, as I said four other sisters that lived in town with us and they were, were fairly close. We had Christmas dinner, Thanksgiving dinner together at one of the sisters' houses and all of the cousins would come together so that would be my mother's side of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now do you know if she followed the Madam Walker [Madam C.J. Walker] method or Annie Malone method or?
Speaker 2: No, I don't, I don't recall that, I don't recall. I'm sure she was aware of all those things. I remember having to go to beauty shows sometimes and I'm sure Madam Walker was in there whatever. But I'm not familiar with the product. I knew that they heated the iron to do the people's hair and before the--she then--then I do remember the evolution of chemicals, but in the early days it was hot iron and grease that they did the women's hair with. That's what I recall about that.
Story_ID: 642075
Speaker 1: Let me go to your father's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: William Franklyn Richardson [William F. Richardson, Sr.], just like mine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Senior.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth was June the 12th, 1923. To the best of my ability Irmo, South Carolina or, Irmo, South Carolina that's where he was--
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: I-R-M-O, it's on the outskirts of Columbia [South Carolina]. Today, I think Columbia might have attached it.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right now what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side and how far back can you trace them and what were they doing in history?
Speaker 2: My father's, my father's mother, my father's mother's mother, yes, was Della Burton--Della, Della Richardson, sorry Della Richardson. And Della Richardson was a midwife and she was very popular and highly regarded in the community as a midwife. She had bir- she had given--she had assisted in the birth of many of the children of the community. And her, her mother--Della was born in slavery and her mother was a slave. My father's mother was Emma, Emma Richardson--Emma Williams, I'm sorry, Emma Williams. She--I really don't know Della's--I don't know my grandmother's father [Willie Richardson] or my grandmother's--my grandmother's, my grandmother's initial name was Richardson as well like Della, she was one of the Richardsons. She married somebody after my father--that's what it is, after my father was born. My father was born to my grandmother out of wedlock. So my father's name was William Richardson. His brother was Wesley Richardson, so they were both born out of wedlock. My third uncle was named Williams, Aaron Williams, because my grandmother got married subsequent to the birth of her two sons. So her name was Emma Richardson Williams. I know that my grandmother on my father's side had some siblings, I just don't know who they were. And my, my grandmother you know had a, had a daughter named Berthena [sic. Gertrude Richardson], so my brother had--my dad had a sister named Berthena.
Speaker 1: So, he had like two brothers and a sister?
Speaker 2: Right, two brothers and a sister--that's what my father had.
Story_ID: 642076
Speaker 1: My father [William F. Richardson, Sr.] left South Carolina when he was fourteen. He had to leave because he had, he had spoken (background noise)--he had spoken out of place to a white man and they told him--it was such a bad encounter, whatever the situation, he had to get out of town before the next morning. So he had to get in the bottom of a truck and his uncle took him out in the dark, at night, and they sent him to Baltimore [Maryland] where his father was, 'cause his father was Frederick Bowers, Sr. [sic.] who lived in Baltimore. He went to, he went to Baltimore and he got hooked up with a guy who wasn't to--a good reputation. So my father--somebody saw my father and told his father that he was in Baltimore, "Your son, who's fourteen years old, is up there with the wrong guy." And so my father [sic. grandfather] told him, "Send him up to me," and so that's how my father got to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and he was fourteen when he got to Baltimore. And, he met his--he connected with his father in Baltimore.
Speaker 2: Okay, so his--okay, so your father was smuggled out to Baltimore to be with his, his father who was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, not his father, but a friend who took him into Baltimore. But the guy he went to was shady, and a friend of my father's heard that his son was there and he sent--my father sent for his son to come--. My grandfather, Frederick Bowers, sent for him from Baltimore to come to Philadelphia 'cause he was in Philadelphia--my grandfather was in Philadelphia.
Speaker 2: Now this is Frederick Bowers?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Frederick Bowers (background noise). Frederick Bowers, Jr. [ph.].
Speaker 2: Okay it's interesting the way you describe the incident because it sounds the way people described it back in those days.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: My dad had a similar incident he described in the family, where he said that someone said an unkind word to a white woman and he had to get out of the town (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 2: It's always euphemized like that. Do you know what really happened? Is there a story about what really happened?
Speaker 1: I don't remember the details on it. I know dad was--he wasn't very articulate about it, he never rehearsed it often.
Speaker 2: I'm just thinking he's like fourteen years old and (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He threatened--the white man did something and my father threatened him or either hit him, and they knew that night they would be there to kill him, and they knew he had to get out.
Speaker 2: So this is what should have happened with Emmett Till, but he stayed and they got him?
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Right. That's exactly right, same kind of situation.
Speaker 2: Emmett Till was thirteen, your father was fourteen.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Similar. I mean, it may not be exactly the same thing--
Speaker 1: No, but a confrontation with a white man based on white folks' superiority, and my father was a little bit--whatever, he got rebellious about it and consequently they, the family knew he had to leave town 'cause he'd be dead, and he left.
Speaker 2: Maybe Trayvon Martin too (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh my god, all kinds of crazy stuff.
Story_ID: 642077
Speaker 1: So your father [William F. Richardson, Sr.] goes to Baltimore [Maryland] then ends up in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]. Now, how, how old is, is he when he arrives (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Gets to Philadelphia? I imagine just about a year afterwards, so maybe about fifteen, he got to Philadelphia fairly young and, and he lived with his father and his wife.
Speaker 1: Now his father was--what was his father's name?
Speaker 2: Frederick Bowers the--
Speaker 1: Fred Bowers, okay.
Speaker 2: Senior, Frederick Bowers, Sr.--or the second, Fred Bow- Frederick Bowers, Jr. [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay, and he's the--he's your father's father's father or--
Speaker 2: No, he is my father's father.
Speaker 1: Father's father. Okay.
Speaker 2: Frederick Bowers is my father's father.
Speaker 1: All right, so--okay, so, he's the father that fathered him out of wedlock.
Speaker 2: That's right to Emma Richardson [Emma Richardson Williams].
Speaker 1: Right. Okay so even though his name is Richardson, his father is Bowers. So he's in Philadelphia and--now did your dad have a chance to finish school?
Speaker 2: No, my dad did not finish school, but he was very articulate, he could well--write, read and write, write very well, his script was excellent. And he spent the first part of his career as a milkman for Abbott Dairies [sic. Abbotts Dairies, Inc., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. Back in the day when they delivered milk every day, he drove the milk truck and delivered to homes. That was his first job that I recall, I mean I'm sure he had other jobs.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's a good job in those days?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh my god, yeah. And then after that--when that terminated he worked for a little bit in a hospital, I think it was. I think he had a night shift job, but then eventually he got a job working for a slaughterhouse company called Cross Brothers [Cross Brothers Meat Packers, Inc.], they were a kosher slaughterhouse. And he was there several years, maybe twenty years my dad was at Cross Brothers. He retired from Cross Brothers and let's see 1982, about 1982 he retired and moved. He couldn't find employment, so I had him to move here to New York. At that time we owned--our community development corporation [Ujamaa Community Development Corporation, Mount Vernon, New York] owned a building here and we needed a super, so he and my mother [Amanda Ellison Richardson] moved in there, he became the super for that building. At the end of that, when he retired from that, he worked for the City of Mount Vernon [New York] for four or five years in a, in a position in the Department of--DPW, Public Works [Mount Vernon Department of Public Works].
Story_ID: 642078
Speaker 1: We're at the point now, we've got your mother [Amanda Ellison Richardson] and father [William F. Richardson, Sr.] both in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: (Pause) My, my mother and father, I vaguely recall, I don't recall what the story was. They met--what I do know is that my mother was a member of Mount Pisgah A.M.E. Church [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. My father was a Baptist and she gave up going to A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church to become a Baptist, that's how I became a Baptist. And they--I really don't recall how they met, they--it would be interesting to find out. I mean, I--somebody has the story, and somebody--I know somebody I could get the story from. I'll think about that (laughter).
Story_ID: 642079
Speaker 1: Now did you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I have (cough), I have a brother--I had a brother, and a sister [Vickilyn Richardson Reynolds]. I have a sister; my brother passed.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, can you name everybody, you and your siblings and put yourself where you fit in?
Speaker 2: Sure, I'm the oldest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then there was my brother, Ronald Ellis Richardson, known as Ron Richardson. My brother was--we all grew up together. My brother was extremely talented as a musician, as gifted as a--vocally. And so my mother [Amanda Ellison Richardson] sacrificed early on for him to have voice lessons and so forth. He eventually--he sang in the churches and people used to ask him to come sing because he was a singer. He ultimately followed the promise of that--those gifts, and he acted on various shows and music opportunities came to him. Ultimately, he won a Tony Award [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre] in New York [New York] for 'Big River' [William Hauptman] and I was there the night--he and I went together that night to the Tony Awards, not thinking he was going to win but just going. But he won the Tony Award and from that his career even blossomed further. He was the first American to do a Broadway play in Japanese in Japan for the queen. He died early, he died at--he was forty-two, of HIV/AIDS [human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome], which was an interesting thing for our church [Grace Baptist Church, Mount Vernon, New York] because I used to--back then it was highly whispered about and stigmatized. When he--when I found out he had AIDS, I asked him did he mind me talking about it to the congregation so that they could be open and helpful and he said he didn't. So it became a rallying point for our congregation back in those days. We were one of the first congregations to advocate breaking the silence, and it was a wonderful time of catharsis for many people in the church because they had family members who were dying from AIDS and they weren't owning it and so forth. So he died in 19--I can't remember the year, but he was forty-two, he was born in '51 [1951] or '52 [1952], let's see, '49 [1949], '50 [1950], '51 [1951], fifty- yeah '51 [1951]. He was born in '51 [1951], he was three years older than me--three younger than me.
Story_ID: 642080
Speaker 1: And then I have a sister, who is six years younger than me, three years younger than him [Richardson's brother, Ron Richardson]. Her name is Vickilyn, L-Y-N, Vicki, V-I-C-K-I-L-Y-N. Vickilyn Richardson [Vickilyn Richardson Reynolds], and she was affected by his desire for the music world and for performing and so forth, and so she has, she has gifts as well. But not--I don't think to the extent of his, but she certainly is gifted as a songstress. And so she ended up doing several things. She got married [to Albert Reynolds], she has two children, two boys and she is in California. She had a show, a television show, a sitcom called, I think it was called 'Black and White' [sic.] or something like that. Her partner in the show was a white girl they--'Sugar and Spice' that was the name of it. 'Sugar and Spice' was the show, sitcom. So she's had small parts in movies and she's done commercials, she had the television show. She's very well exposed in terms of singing, but she never got full bursts into singing. She wrote, wrote recen- in recent times a play around the first Tony Award [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre] winner in the United States. What's her name, Hattie McDaniel, that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, Academy Award [Oscar].
Speaker 1: Academy Award, I'm sorry. And she wrote a play ['Hattie: What I Need You to Know!'] around her and then she performed the play off Broadway here in New York [New York]. She wrote it and performed it for the black theater of Harlem [National Black Theatre] and it ran there for about two months in Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Was that in the '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 1: No, that was, that was recently in the last five years or so. So she's still in California, she's getting ready to do a movie or something but that's--those are my two siblings. I also had a sibling that was not formally adopted, but adopted into our family. His name was Raymond Lloyd [Raymond Richardson], he died maybe six years ago, and so he was in our home much of the time. He really was fairly adopted my grandmother [Mattie Clinkseale Ellison], but as my grandmother got older, my mother [Amanda Ellison Richardson] took him on because his mother abandoned him. So my grandmother took him in and then my mother kind of taken over--took over from there.
Speaker 2: Now this is your mother's mother?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So that's--those are my immediate family coming, coming up in that situation.
Speaker 2: Okay, now--so did your grandmother live with you when you were grow- when you were--
Speaker 1: That's interesting, my mother's grandmother [sic.] did not, she lived in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and we would go to their home. My grandfather [Wade Ellison] had a home on Baring Street in West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. But my mother--my father's mother did move with us during the years of--a good portion of the years of our growing up and she assisted my, my mother in rearing us. She eventually went back to South Carolina, but she was there for a good portion of my development years and had a greater impact on my younger siblings than she did on me because I think I was pretty much almost out of there before she came really. But she was there during part of my growing up but not like she was with the younger kids.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But Emma Williams [Richardson's paternal grandmother, Emma Richardson Williams] did live with us. She took us to church on Wednesday nights for prayer meeting.  So I mean, she, she, she assisted our involvement in the church with my mother and father [William F. Richardson, Sr.].
Story_ID: 642081
Speaker 1: When you consider your parents' personalities and their talents and their dispositions and their, their mannerisms, the way they looked, who do you think you take after?
Speaker 2: Probably undeniably my mother [Amanda Ellison Richardson], um-hm, yes probably. I think. That's what everybody says and I think I agree with that. That I most take on her characteristics, her features.
Speaker 1: What qualities about her do you share?
Speaker 2: She's very--she was always very, she was jovial, very full of laughter, generally a happy person. She was an entrepreneur, she had her own business [Amanda's Beauty Bar, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and she sustained it and she took care of all of the business of the house. Dad [William F. Richardson, Sr.] would bring home the check, give it to her and she would manage all of the things of the house. She was very, very religious, or should I say very spiritual. And I learned spirituality from her first. She was--well she is--well she was because today she is down that road, that long walk towards the edge, the river's bank where she is not able to--her memory is not what it was and it's not--she can't recall in organized ways her past, so it's that long walk. But she had a lot of good characteristics as a person. She was very alert and knowledgeable of the times and the issues that were going on--things that were going on. And my--and she was in charge, you know my dad had authority but she was in charge, and he--as opposed to my father was much more a laid back fellow and a very good father, very good--well a good provider. He was there for us, we respected him extremely. He--like I said he was the authority of the house.  But I think my personality mostly follows that of my mother's.

Speaker 1: Can you describe where you grew up; or did you grow up in the same place basically or was it a number of different--
Speaker 2: No, no. We grew up in West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] hi- West Philadelphia, West Philadelphia at 43rd [Street] and Ogden [Street]. That's where my mother had a beauty shop [Amanda's Beauty Bar] on the corner and the house was attached to the beauty shop. I never knew any other residence than that accept for a brief period, we moved to Elmwood [Elmwood Park, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. My parents [Amanda Ellison Richardson and William F. Richardson, Sr.] wanted to move to a suburb, a nicer neighborhood, and we moved there and they were--apparently they had bought the house in Elmwood but at the same time they were trying to sell the house in West Philadelphia. The--we were in Elmwood and the house caught fire, so in the process of the house being on fire, they let that house go or whatever they did, and we ended up back at the house in West Philly. Apparently they couldn't, they couldn't sustain both properties and so when the fire came they decided just to go back to West Philadelphia. So I spent my entire growing up in one house at 43rd and Ogden with that--with a brief period of going to Elmwood it was less than a year.
Speaker 1: Now is this a big house pretty much?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a pretty big house. It wasn't a grand house; it was just a big house. It was one of the bigger houses on the block because it was a corner, corner lot. It had a beauty shop there, and then it had three bedrooms on the second floor and two bedrooms on the third floor, and it had a living room attached to the beauty shop. Then it had a dining room and a kitchen. So it was, it was a big house, but it was a coal furnace, and--but that's where we grew up. It didn't have much yard, very little yard, but across the street from the school [Crossroads Accelerated Academy, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was a, was a, was a elementary school, so there was a basketball place over where we'd go play after school.
Story_ID: 642083
Speaker 1: We always ask this question: what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights. (Pause) I think the sights were cars and people; people going to work, people shopping, people on the playground playing basketball--guys playing basketball. The--there was no predominant sound other than the busy hustle. We lived--we were actually a block away from Lancaster Avenue, which was a busy thoroughfare, so one of the sounds that rings out in my mind is the move- the sound of the trolley car. It used to go down Lancaster Avenue, number ten trolley [SEPTA Route 10] used to go up and down there. You could hear that a block away and you became accustomed to that. There were some trees in our neighborhood [West Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. There weren't a lot of big yards in the neighborhood. They were mostly houses more like, kind of like townhouses.
Speaker 1: You mean like row houses?
Speaker 2: Yeah, row houses, yeah. Corner stores, barbershops, schools. Not far away was the Fairmount Park [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which was the, which was the greenery. I think that's what I saw growing up; I think that would capture what I saw.
Story_ID: 642084
Speaker 1: So you had a basketball court across the street.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And--now you were growing up during the--
Speaker 2: Wilt Chamberlain and all that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, now he's a, he's a big deal in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: That's right, no question about it
Speaker 1: He--well explain you know his background.
Speaker 2: Well, he went to Overbrook High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which was right--my brother [Ron Richardson] went to Overbrook High School so--and you know basketball in Philadelphia was, in that time was really, really--and the West Philadelphia--when I was in high school the team in West Philadelphia, that was a big team, the West Philadelphia High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] team was a big team. I forgot what they used to call it, West Chester, West Philly--can't remember, but that was big. So basketball was big and predominant in the African American community in, in the '60s [1960s]. That would be the area when I was focused on. I graduated in 1966 from West Philadelphia, so it would be six years prior to that then.
Speaker 1: You were a kid when Chamberlain set the record by scoring a hundred points.
Speaker 2: That's right, sure.
Speaker 1: Was that with the--did they call them the 76ers [Philadelphia 76ers] then, the Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: No I don't think it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The Warriors [Philadelphia Warriors; Golden State Warriors]--
Speaker 2: The Warriors that what it was, yeah. Yeah, that's right. But I was never a big sports fan, even though I was affected and intersected with the energy of that. I never was a sports fan per se. My dad [William F. Richardson, Sr.], he was a sportsman. He wished that he could make his sons sportsmen, but I played a little bit of high school basketball--no high school football for my dad (laughter), so he could have a son who played and he could have something to cheer about. But I never--I quit--I was a--the first semester I guess I quit playing football, so I never made nothing of that. So I never was sports inclined and didn't do much following of it. I liked, I liked model cars and I liked cars and I liked bikes. So I didn't have an attraction for baseball or football. My dad played softball, I used to go to the games with him, but I never followed in that line and I had a reasonable knowledge of all the sports now, but I'm still not a real, you know, gung ho sports guy.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So what did you like to do growing up other then--I mean, what other things did you like to do? You said you liked cars and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I liked cars and I liked to work, I liked to make money (laughter). I found my first job down the street at a barbershop, Italian guy had a barbershop and I used to--he hired me and let me come sweep the floor and clean up his barbershop at the end of the day. He would pay me so much every day, I did that. That was my first job. Then I had a job around the corner from there where it was a shoe shine parlor, shoe shine stand really, and I did that for some time. And then when I graduated--no while I was in high school, I worked as an orderly at West Park Hospital in West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. And then I worked for--after graduation or just before graduation I worked for Freeman Hankins' funeral home in Philadelphia. So those things were ways in which I always found myself generating, you know money.  And then I ended up, ended up accepting the call to ministry while I was at Hankins Funeral Home [Hankins Funeral Home, Inc.].
Story_ID: 642085
Speaker 1: Was music a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, (cough) music was a big part of it. I, I didn't, didn't--my mother didn't, didn't--well I wouldn't say allow, but didn't encourage or didn't make possible for us to go to the stuff like at the Uptown [Uptown Theater, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and the shows and The Temptations and the Four Seasons and all that. We didn't get to do that, but certainly it was a part of the culture. And then there was music from the church [Community Baptist Church of West Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which we did have tremendous access to with James Cleveland and Aretha Franklin and all of the music of the church was part of us. And we sang in the choir, I sang in the choir. I was the president of the youth department, so the church made a tremendous environment for my nurturing, the Young People's Fellowship, the church choir, trips with the church. All those things kind of set--that's what my parents [Amanda Ellison Richardson and William F. Richardson, Sr.] wanted us to have, that environment in which to be cocooned. So we were not left to roam the streets, we weren't left to be able to go to the gangs, we couldn't--we had to give accountability for where we were. We couldn't stay out on the steps late at night. We had to be in by dark, just kinds of expectations that were established to which we conformed. My parents didn't want us to be associating with everybody, not out of elitistness but just out of a sense that they didn't--they knew that other people around us didn't have their values. So they didn't want to have us compromised, or the values that they were trying to put in us compromised by the people who were around (background noise) us who had not the same values.
Story_ID: 642086
Speaker 1: Your neighborhood (background noise), how would you de- from what I've read I guess in my notes here, it was like a, a mixed ethnic neighborhood in terms of the people?
Speaker 2: Yeah it was, it was, it was, it was, it was not--it was on the--when we moved--while I lived there it was a neighborhood that was--the early part of my living there was a quick transition to white people, so white people were just about all gone. The only remnants were white businesses that still stayed around. But the resident population to most of my--I don't remember many white people, if any, living in the neighborhood when I was growing up. But it was a freshly transitioned neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Now in terms of the barbershop, the Italian barbershop, were his customers Italian?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, but they were still--the barbershop was even able to hold on to former residents because there is something about a barber that is personal and. So for a long time he was able to have his barbershop there and still be Italian owners. But, but and not--and then there were other sections not--right near our section where there was white communities still existing, but eventually all of West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] transitioned into a black community and that's the community that predominantly I grew up in, because it started with lower West Philadelphia, which is 43rd [Street], 50th [Street], then you saw it going up to 58th Street, 59th [Street] and on up to a section called Winwood--or Wynnefield [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. So eventually it just com- white people continued to move further north or further west. And as they went up, the black communities bought the neighborhoods and so forth. So we were in the second phase, the first phase was called Black Bottom [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], it became to be called Black Bottom. But the second phase was were we was, this middle section which was West Philadelphia, Southwest Philly [Southwest Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and then they moved. Then further up West Philadelphia became black and then blacks eventually moved into Germantown [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and whites took--moved from there. So for my whole career--my whole life growing up was this period of transition that was going on that I wasn't as aware of what was going on as I am today as I look back and see it. It was always a period of transition.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Whites were constantly moving. Blacks were moving in, taking over the old houses they were buying moving them.
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned gangs, were gangs like prominent during (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, there were gangs, there were gangs. The lower, the lower the income level of the community, the more predominant the gangs were. So there were gangs not in my immediate location so much, but right off in the south of us, which is what I called the Black Bottom, used to be several gangs. But gang life was not as much predicating murder as it is today, didn't--people weren't getting murdered. It wasn't attached to drugs either. It was just like people needing to belong to something. Fighting was fist fighting and stealing was marginal stealing. It was not--so it was a different kind of gang life than what you hear today about what gangs are.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, more turf control--
Speaker 2: Yeah that's right.
Story_ID: 642087
Speaker 1: Now, where did you start school?
Speaker 2: I went to Stevens Elementary School [Thaddeus Stevens Elementary School], which was downtown in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]. And--
Speaker 1: You didn't go to school across the street?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Well why, why not?
Speaker 2: I don't know why I didn't go to school across the street. I think it was, my mother [Amanda Ellison Richardson] had an idea about Stevens being a special school. It was downtown Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Is that S-T-E-P-H or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, S-T-E-V-E--
Speaker 1: V-E? Okay.
Speaker 2: I think that's it. So I went there and then I went to--I didn't stay there--I think I might have stayed there one year, two years. I don't know if it was a preschool, whatever. But then I ended up going to Belmont, which was walking distance from my home, Belmont Elementary School [Belmont Academy Charter School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and then from Belmont--again my mother was always putting me into what she thought was the better schools--public schools. So I ended up going to Shaw, which was integrated, Shaw Junior High [Anna Howard Shaw Junior High School; Hardy Williams Elementary, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and I'd get on the bus to go there. And then I went to West (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were they doing busing then in Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: No, no, no. This was just the bus--
Speaker 1: Just the regular city bus (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Transportation, yeah. Then I went to West Philadelphia High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and graduated in 1966. As I said my mother had gone there too, West Philadelphia High School.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did, did you like school?
Speaker 2: I don't think I particularly liked it. I didn't have a great dislike for it. I loved the--I think I liked the socialization. I think it took a while before I liked scholarship and there was a reason for that that I didn't really discover until I had gone to Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia]. When I was in high school, the counselor, guidance counselor said to me that I was not college material and that I should go to vocational or something like that, plumbing or something. This was a white gentleman, Mr. Dribben [ph.]. And that seemed to be in conflict with my own expectations, it was in conflict with what I thought I could become and also it was in conflict with the fact that I later decided that I was going to be a minister. And so--I needed to go--my view to be a minister was that I needed to go to college and I needed to get some training. So after high school I tried to ignore his advice and went to--enrolled in West Chester Community College--not West Chester, West Philadelphia Community College [sic. Community College of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and did terribly bad. I worked for Hankins Funeral Home [Hankins Funeral Home, Inc., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], but I also went to college. And I really--and then at the same time I accepted the call to ministry. So I went to talk to my pastor and I told him I wanted to be trained for ministry and so forth even though I had--I didn't know why. I really didn't take time to analyze why I hadn't done good in community college. And so he recommended that I go to Virginia Union.
Story_ID: 642088
Speaker 1: How were your grades in grade school? Did you have trouble in grade school or (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't think I had trouble, didn't have trouble, didn't have trouble. No, I had fair grades, I didn't have great grades. I didn't have--I had average grades. But so when my--when the pastor [James Hamlin] recommended I go to Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia], I applied and they accepted me and when they gave me the first area test they discovered that I had--I was reading impaired. That I couldn't read even though I had gone through twelve years of school, the only thing I had read and struggled through at West Philadelphia High was the 'Tale of Two Cities' ['A Tale of Two Cities'] by Charles Dickens.
Speaker 1: Now, did you know that you couldn't read?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh, because I could read enough to verbalize. What my problem was was that I wasn't comprehending what I was reading. So they put me in a year of remedial assistance at Virginia Union, and that turned my whole education experience around. It's like it opened up my mind to really consume the scholarship.
Speaker 1: Okay now there is--so this is a condition, this is an educational--
Speaker 2: It's a casualty of the inner school cities--the inner school system. To a large degree they just social promote you. You know if you don't have any behavioral problems, you can get right on out. The school system in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] were not good at that time. I don't know if they are any better now, or at least the high school experience was not good.
Speaker 1: I was just wondering if it was a cognitive problem like dyslexia or something like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, unh-uh, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: It wasn't like that?
Speaker 2: It wasn't that at all, it was that I had not been taught to read and to fully comprehend. It's kind of like a dysfunction that is tolerated, okay. And Virginia Union decided that they would turn it around, and I wasn't the only one. One of my best friends, or my best friend, who is, who today is the mayor of Richmond, Virginia, Dwight Jones [Dwight Clinton Jones], had the same identical experience. He went to Virginia Union and he had to go to remedial 'cause he couldn't read. He grew up in Germantown, Germantown High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which was supposed to be better than West Philadelphia High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. But he had the same situation.
Speaker 1: That just seems incredible that you could be graduated from high school and--I hear it all the time but--I mean, "I came out of high school and I can't read," but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm. So Union took me, and accepted me under the condition that I take the remedial.
Story_ID: 642089
Speaker 1: Okay, now I want to back--go back--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --to growing up. And, now what was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: Community Baptist Church [Community Baptist Church of West Philadelphia] at 40th [Street] and Spring Garden Street in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Now, this is the institution where you really formed like what (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Shaped my early values and socialize- socialization exposure.
Speaker 1: Who was the pastor?
Speaker 2: Jam- Reverend James Edward Hamlin [James Hamlin].
Speaker 1: Okay. So this is the pastor who recommended you to Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yep, yep, um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was--you said that you were involved in the choir and the youth committees there and stuff like that. So, so, did the--so the church, I take it, gave you responsibilities as a youth and, and--
Speaker 2: The church fostered confidence, the church made me develop leadership skills, speaking skills. The church gave me exposure to somewhat successful people, the church provided love and cocooning when--and I spent a lot of time in the church. My, my travels, most of them were associated with the church. We'd go to a theme park or we'd go to Coney Island [New York, New York] or we'd go to Wildwood, New Jersey or we'd go to Atlantic City [New Jersey]. Those were all church picnics, church outings. So the ceremonies of life were conducted in the church, you know births, dedications, baptisms, Easter Sunday, Christmas. The church was the center of our--a core of our, of our lives and socializations where our family went on weekends after mama [Amanda Ellison Richardson] wasn't working, daddy [William F. Richardson, Sr.] wasn't working, Sunday we'd go to church. We'd have dinner after church. So the church was a centerpiece of my whole cultural development.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the church also provided aspiration for achievement, it was part of the DNA of the church experience that they aspi- that they encouraged the aspiration of achievement. So the church people always wanted you to be something and you know, and there were some models around, what you could be. And the church was always pushing positive kinds of activities so my parents kept us there.
Story_ID: 642090
Speaker 1: Was Community Baptist Church [Community Baptist Church of West Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]--how was it positioned in terms of the Civil Rights Movement in those days?
Speaker 2: My pastor [James Hamlin] was--you see by 19--by the time I was involved in the church in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], the Civil Rights Movement in the North was not as predominate as it was in the South. My pastor was associated---I'll tell ya--I think that in Philadelphia in the '60s [1960s], the political movement was more--the Civil Rights Movement was more political. It could be because African Americans were getting elected to office and involved in politics. As opposed to the South, the Civil Rights Movement had to be all protests because they were on the outside completely. Blacks were on the inside in Philadelphia, you had the Marshall Shepard, who was the great clerk of deeds and the city councilmen in Philadelphia back in those days, Marshall Shepard, Sr. [Marshall L. Shepard, Sr.]. And so you had blacks involved in the Democratic Party as district leaders. My dad [William F. Richardson, Sr.] was a district leader at one time, and then you had black state senators and you had--so you had Congressman Nix [Robert N.C. Nix, Sr.], the congressman from Philadelphia. The Civil Rights Movement in the '60s [1960s] took on its life in the political processes as opposed to protests. We had Leon Sullivan who was expressing civil rights in the economic juncture with progressive (unclear), OIC [Opportunities Industrialization Centers], equipping people to work and so it was a different kind of move. And then when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] who came to town, my pastor would meet with him as he would meet with other pastors. So they, they saw an affinity, but they had a different experience in the North than they were having in Alabama or in different places in the South, Mississippi. They were having a different experience. Now racism was formative but it was expressed in different ways. There was some more tolerance. The tolerance in my opinion caused black people to feel that they had achieved more than they really had achieved. It's kind of like a doping reality because it--they contrast how they were doing in the North with what they were doing in the South and concluded they were doing better. That racism didn't exist in the South, when in fact it did but it wasn't as overt.
Speaker 1: Okay. And for instance like, what was Philadelphia like when you were growing up in terms of race relations, in terms of where people lived and went to school. What kind of opportunities (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the segregation was definitely in the neighborhoods. So you had the separation in the neighborhoods. And that's why I say it was a quick transition 'cause white people--as soon as white people saw black people coming they were moving out, their house would be up for sale. So in Philadelphia that was a reality, the separate communities and all the communities unto themselves. You had interaction with white people in--as race related to commerce, business, government offices providing services, teachers in the classroom. You'd have white teachers, you'd have white administrators. So those things is where the intersection of the two communities came together; they didn't intersect in the faith community, they didn't intersect in the residential populations, they didn't intersect in the social life. It was primarily two separate worlds but intersecting at commerce, at municipal services and schools.
Story_ID: 642091
Speaker 1: How was your church [Community Baptist Church of West Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I guess, positioned--I mean was, was your church a part of the National Baptist Convention [National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, my church was--my pastor [James Hamlin] was very involved in the National Baptist Convention and he would take a group of people every year to the National Baptist Convention. And the--I didn't go, the first time we had an opportunity to go was in Denver, Colorado and I didn't go, but my brother [Ron Richardson] had a chance to go, so he went to the convention that first time as a teenager. I did have an opportunity to go represent the church at a state convention as I got a little older in Harrisburg [Pennsylvania], I think, a couple of places. They had me go represent the church, which was a wonderful exposure and experience. And involvement in the National Baptist Convention back in that time essentially meant that you attended the convention. There wasn't a lot of--and that your church supported some of the programs in the National Baptist Convention such as the work in foreign missions in Africa. You probably have bought your hymnals from the convention, they unify hymnals so they all are the same. You probably got your Sunday school literature from the publishing board [National Baptist Publishing Board; R.H. Boyd Publishing Corporation, Nashville, Tennessee]. That's what it meant to be a member of the National Baptist Convention, it meant to be in attendance, you probably belong to an association of the state convention all of which belonged to the National Baptist Convention. So it provided the vehicle for relationships between Baptist churches and so that was meaningful. So yes, our church was deeply a national Baptist church.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause that's the largest black organization, still is, in the world is the National Baptist Convention.
Speaker 2: Well, it's, it's diminished in the last--I served for thirteen years as general secretary of the National Baptist Convention under Dr. T.J. Jemison, and in recent years it's gone down some. Today I'm chairman of the Conference of National Black Churches, which is all nondenominations coming together around education and social justice and economic development.
Story_ID: 642092
Speaker 1: Is it when you're in high school that you are called to the ministry?
Speaker 2: Ye- well I think it--no it wasn't, it was after high school. I mean, I might have had the call struggling with the idea while I was in high school. I know I have specific instances where I struggled with the idea of ministry while I was in high school.
Speaker 1: Well, let me go back to high school and just ask you what activities were you involved in, in high school? (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, one of the great things that happened in my high school--this shows another connection to the church. My pastor, Reverend Hamlin [James Hamlin], was on the staff of the West Philadelphia High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] as a counselor, or a community--I don't really know what his role was but he was on the staff. As I had an opportunity to see him, not only on Sunday but I could see him during the week in school in the classroom. So he became a strong influence and mentor in my life. So I go to high school every day, I would walk to school from my house to West Philadelphia High, go to classes. I didn't have, as I said, my socialization was primarily in the life of the church [Community Baptist Church of West Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. I did go to the prom; I don't think I had many other activities. I was associated strangely enough with the newspaper, but I couldn't read (laughter). I was part of that group, you know that said that we were the editors and so forth but it wasn't really functioning that way. And then I worked on the weekends, so choir rehearsal at night, one night a week I'd go to choir rehearsal. So that, those were the kinds of things that dominated my life while I was in high school. At the same time though, I was struggling with this notion about being a minister because I think for--that probably began to foster in me when I was in junior high school [Anna Howard Shaw Junior High School; Hardy Williams Elementary, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. But it wasn't a popular thing; I didn't want to be that. I didn't want to be a minister because my view of ministry was that it was, it required the sacrifices I didn't want to make and it required a lifestyle I didn't want to live and it was unpopular to be a young man talking about being in the ministry.
Speaker 1: Now what would have been cool, I mean for you at that age (laughter) in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]? What were you aspiring to be (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) To be a businessman, a doctor, a lawyer, those are cool things to be. Being a minister wasn't--wasn't to be viewed as cool. So I, I kind of strayed--stayed away from that notion; I suppressed that.
Story_ID: 642093
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Amanda Ellison Richardson] and your uncles kind of--?
Speaker 2: No they, they never, I think that my mother--I think all of my family always thought I was going to be a minister no matter what I said. They felt that I had the markings on me of being a minister and that it was obvious that I was going to be that. In their view there was no question, even though they never pushed it or advocated it, they just put me in the environment. And (laughter), when I decided when I was in high school [West Philadelphia High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] I wasn't going to be a minister, I was going to be a doctor. So I went to high sch- went to work for West Park Hospital [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] after school my last year or the last two years, the eleventh grade. And that's when I was an orderly and so forth. I met the doctors there and they liked me and they said if I were to graduate they would help me go to medical school and so forth. But at the same time, I still struggled with this idea about ministry trying to suppress it and ultimately I had a surgery in 1966, appendectomy, emergency surgery.
Speaker 1: You were like sixteen?
Speaker 2: Right. The surgery was in '65 [1965], and my last year of high school. So at that--long story short, I promised the Lord that if I got through the surgery 'cause at the end of the surgery--the surgery wasn't so bad, but the ap- the spinal they gave me we- malfunctioned and I ended up being paralyzed longer than I was supposed to be and that was really traumatic. And in the process of that, I told the Lord I would go ahead and accept the ministry and preach. When I got out, I still wasn't going to do it (laughter); I still was going to be a doctor. I'll never forget the mixed emotions my dad [William F. Richardson, Sr.] had. When I came home after having presided a funeral one night, I told him I decided I was going to go into the ministry and be a preacher. My dad kind of like you know it was all right that I was going to do that, but he had his mind set on his son being a doctor (laughter). So I accepted--I called my pastor [James Hamlin] the next day and told him that I had finally decided that I'm going into the ministry, I want to go to school. So he said come over and meet with me, and I met with him and from there I ended up preaching my trial sermon, my initial sermon before I left for college, then I went on to Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia]. So that's the journ- the walk for me.
Speaker 1: Now what did you preach about? What was your first sermon about?
Speaker 2: May 27, nineteen sixty--1967. I preached I have no need to want, the Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want [Psalms 23:1]. I talked about the, that, that there's no need to want, that God provides all that I, all that I need and that that was worth celebrating, I have no need. Kind of living life with a guarantee, under a--with a foundation, under, underpinning, a s- a net to catch you 'cause God will provide my needs. So I remember that (unclear) it's been fifty- almost fifty years ago.

Speaker 1: You're going to Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia] and they try to deal with your reading problem that--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, how did they deal with that? They just--
Speaker 2: Well, it's a very kind of a scientific approach. They had a whole, they have a whole laboratory set up for it, and the curriculum on how to adjust. Apparently this was a not a norm- was not an abnormal problem from urban schools. You know Virginia Union got its population, in those days and now, the majority nationally came from Virginia, but the second largest group was New York, the third was Maryland and D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and the fourth was Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]. So they were used to getting urban students who came with problems and challenges of reading inabilities or remediation necessary. So they had a whole department and the reading specialist, Laverne Byrd [Laverne Byrd Smith], was my--I remember the teacher who helped me, assisted me. It was almost like a one on one kind of situation. It wasn't like just a classroom, it was like--and then they would give you like the other courses mixed in, you didn't just do all reading but you were in remediation for a year and it would help you get back on schedule if you applied yourself, you could overcome.
Speaker 1: How did you like campus life?
Speaker 2: I loved it and I was very popular. I became, I was the freshman, president of the freshman class and then I was the president of the sophomore class. I was vice president of student government. So it was wonderful to me, I had a great time and the socialization. I never joined a fraternity because I was involved in ministry so I--ever since--'cause remember now I came to Richmond [Virginia], to Virginia Union as a licensed minister 'cause my pastor [James Hamlin] let me preach my trial sermon, he licensed me. So that means I had an opportunity as called upon to go preach places. So in Richmond in those days, you had a lot of southern country, rural communities with churches and they needed preachers. So you had the opportunity to get invited--they'd invite the young preachers, undergraduate preachers to come and preach out there. And I could preach pretty good; and I ended up in my second year at Virginia Union getting called to an old historic church [Rising Mount Zion Baptist Church, Richmond, Virginia].
Story_ID: 642095
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-nine [1969], I got called to Rising Mount Zion Baptist Church in Richmond [Virginia], which was a ground shaking, ground, ground breaking because first of all I hadn't done my training, I wasn't married, I mean just all of the criterias were shattered, but it was purely by providence, an accident, coincidence that I got the opportunity to go there because what happen was the seminary was up the street at that time, the School of Theology [Virginia Union University Graduate School of Religion; Samuel DeWitt Proctor School of Theology of Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia], and that's where the preachers who had graduated from college and were in different degrees of receiving their master's of divinity degrees. When churches needed a pastor in town they would call the seminary and the seminary would send them a preacher. This church, Rising Mount Zion, needed a preacher because the preacher they had called--a new pastor they had called to come preach decided at the last minute he wasn't going anymore. Apparently got out of his local church and he had to stay, so he didn't go. So this is on a Saturday night, they called up the seminary and they asked all the preachers in the seminary can you send somebody down. And they said, "Well, everybody is booked, there ain't nobody." So a friend of mine who is up there, George Langhorne [George A. Langhorne] said, "Well, you know there's a young fellow who has his license but he's not in seminary, but he can preach for you tomorrow, if you want me to I can get in touch with him." So subsequently he did, he got me, let me go down and I went down and preached for the church and they liked me. (Background noise) And so they said, "Well, we'll keep him coming back pretty regularly until we get another--until we call another pastor." So they didn't have to worry about--oh what is that noise?
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: All right, so you were talking about what happened at Rising Mount Zion.
Speaker 2: Yeah. So (cough), Rising Mount Zion had me to come down and preach as an interim, you know while they're looking for the pastor. So what happens is the people started liking me even though I don't meet any of the criteria, because they have criteria for what the new pastor ought to be. He ought to be experienced, I wasn't experienced, I was a fros- I was a sophomore at--freshman in college [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia] really. Maybe I was a sophomore, a sophomore, I wasn't a freshman, a sophomore. And then they wanted him to be married, I wasn't married. They wanted him to be a seminary graduate, I hadn't graduated from college. So I didn't have any of the criteria, so the leadership of the church felt pretty safe having me there because I just didn't meet the criteria. But when they had a congregational meeting, they decided, I mean the people in the church, the committee brought in people and the people in the church said, "Well, what about the preacher we've got here now?" They said, "Well, he didn't meet the criteria," and so they voted to move--to change the criteria (laughter). Long story short, they called me as pastor of the church and I ended up getting, at nineteen years old, pastor of a church that was a hundred years old and about four hundred members.  And it was quite a, quite a significant event.
Story_ID: 642096
Speaker 1: Now, here you are in Richmond, Virginia. This is a place where the Baptist legacy includes, you know Samuel DeWitt Proctor--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and, you know so--and Wyatt Tee Walker [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker].
Speaker 2: Gordon Baines Hancock [sic. Gordon Blaine Hancock], G.G. Campbell [Gilbert G. Campbell, Sr.], Joseph Henderson, Joseph Raymond Henderson [J. Raymond Henderson], great preachers from Richmond.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, and this is 1968.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: This is the year that Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated. So this must have been a dramatic year. Here you are, you're not--you're just about twenty years old--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and you're the pastor of one of the oldest--you said it was--
Speaker 2: Nineteen years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, historically--a historical church [Rising Mount Zion Baptist Church, Richmond, Virginia] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Church, yeah.
Speaker 1: In what sense was it historical?
Speaker 2: Well, it was in the, it was in the oldest section of the town, the most poor--the most socially depressed community and it was 100 years old.
Speaker 1: So this is a church that was built right after the Civil War.
Speaker 2: Right, 1869.
Speaker 1: Petersburg--Richmond was the scene of the last battle of the Civil War.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, this is historic stuff.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, do you remember what you were doing when you found out about Dr. King's assassination?
Speaker 2: Well I was on campus, I think I was in my--yeah I was on campus just outside with the guys and the word started spreading that Dr. King had been shot. And then the word came he had died. So by the evening now there is a big rally on the steps of the--on the campus, all the students are out on the campus and everybody's having--and they, everybody is grief stricken, you know. So they ask me--I was president of the freshman class, I guess '68 [1968] I was president of the sophomore class. So they asked me to--I used to go around and quote Martin Luther King's speeches all the time before he died. And so they asked me that night at the rally would I speak, and I gave Dr. King's--one of his speeches. I'm remembered today among the students of Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia] for that night that King died on the steps of the campus, for giving a speech. Giving it in his cadence and in his voice, and it's followed me all these years too.
Speaker 1: Now were you influenced by his oratory (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Extremely so. Having, having come to ministry during the peak of Dr. King's ministry and the time of his most celebrated life, celebrated--his role being most celebrated at that time (background noise), affected the, it affected the black church, it affected--Martin Luther King's legacy to the black church is that it defined what ministry ought to be in the 21st century. So it shaped, for me what ministry was about. In other words, it gave me a map to follow. So it means that, that the gospel has a tremendous social dimension, that it ought to facilitate liberation, it ought to speak out for the downtrodden, it ought to lift the least and the last. I mean his life characterized that, so that has an impact on me as a young man being trained for the ministry. It had everything to do with the prism through which I saw ministry. I saw ministry through Dr. King's eyes because he was so prominent, he was the most celebrated minister in the history of the black church, he was clear and he had demonstrated what ministry meant. Not just the rhetoric of pulpit, but in fact it was the whole business of what ministry ought to be. Also, how you approach the text, how you do the exegesis, how you understand what the Bible is saying was affected by Martin Luther King. So there's no--I don't, I don't--my ministry, my own ministry would be completely different without the role that Martin Luther King played--the impact that he had on that, that period, just tremendously impactful on, on that period.
Story_ID: 642097
Speaker 1: Now, I wanted to ask you about the counter position of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] that was--you saw raise its head in the North, especially in those latter days when King was alive and, and working, a lot of people--I know the preachers, there was a group of preachers in Chicago [Illinois], not all of them, but there was a group that came out against Dr. King coming to Chicago.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I think this has played out in some of the other cities where local groups resisted him and resented him and there was a--and I think we were off camera when we were discussing the split between the National Baptist Convention [National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.] and the group that King--the--
Speaker 2: Progressive.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Progressive National Baptist Convention [Progressive National Baptist Convention, Inc.] that ultimately followed Dr. King. What are your views about that?
Speaker 2: Well, there's no question about it, the black church was not unified around Dr. King, no question about it. There was no unity around what he was doing. There were some people who felt--I mean not just in the church, the whole black community. You had Malcolm [Malcolm X] speaking what he was speaking; you had the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] speaking what they were speaking. So many dynamics were going on; he was one of the voices and was prominent. What I said earlier was that the reason why Dr. King impacted me came at the moment of his death. Dr. King became bigger and iconic at his death. There was more unity about his approach. His message really not--didn't really get hyped or resonance until he died. So, yes there is controversy that existed prior to this death, but at the end of the day when he died, there was more of a consideration and a broader impact that could never have happened while he was living. See he could never have the impact on the social or the theological impact, if it had not been for his death, his death was critical to getting his message out and to be lifted high. Even though he won the Nobel Peace Prize, none of that, he was just one of those people that won the Nobel Peace Prize. It was his death that made way for his message, and his life got examined after his death. Thankfully, that his message was so thorough that it could stand the scrutiny of the kind of examination that they had. So yeah, there always existed this, I think it, I think it softened to a large degree after his death. People saw the violence and so forth and they listened to what he was saying after he died, but no question that the black church was divided over Dr. King's approaches. J.H. Jackson [Joseph H. Jackson] who was the president of the National Baptist Convention felt that protest was not the way. His view was production, he differed with King, he felt production--so we have historical dichotomies as you know all through history where you've got Booker T. Washington and Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois], you got all these guys, Frederick Douglass. So you've got conflicting vie- you know views on how we go forward, how we get through the dilemma and that's what Martin Luther King was until he died. But his death exalted his message, gave scrutiny to his life and the message, and left him--made him iconic. And that iconic status affected every preacher, black and white, who studied anywhere near his death. Who were looking for the definition of what ministry would be, any color, everyone, white or black. It colored their understanding what ministry was about. The progressive division, while some would argue that it was solely about this idea of protest and production, I would say that it was not singularly that. It was that, it was that plus or--that is the plus. Governance was a, was a key issue of the separation.
Story_ID: 642098
Speaker 1: The Progressive Convention started in response to the dominance of J.H. Jackson [Joseph H. Jackson] and the elimination of tenure in the, in the presidency of the convention. Many of the leadership of the progressive felt that they wanted to be one day president, but Dr. Jackson sought and lived out almost a life term. He served thirty years as president and when the progressives left, that gave him license to stay. He might have stayed for eight years if they had never left. But the progressive faction left and they put their hands around the Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] notion, but progressives' leadership, initial leadership were the same people who ran for president of the National Baptist Convention [National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.], who I cherish and reverence, Dr. Gardner Calvin Taylor [HistoryMaker Reverend Gardner Taylor], who ran against Dr. Jackson in 1961 and lost. And he was the first president of the Progressive National Baptist Convention [Progressive National Baptist Convention, Inc.]. So it wasn't just ideological, it was governance issues about having a president who was going to stay forever, or a dictator over a president. Dr. Jackson was viewed as a dictator and the progressive faction, which was the most enlightened faction of the National Baptist Convention, wasn't going to sit by and be dominated by a dictator. So they had the enlightened views of Martin Luther King because Dr. Jackson put Martin Luther King out of the convention and he was intimidated and threatened by it 'cause he, he--Martin Luther King offered an infringement on Dr. King [sic.] being a prominent personality, being the leader of black people.
Speaker 2: Or Jackson being the (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah, Jackson being the leader of black people. So that's where that has gone. Unfortunately, both conventions today are extremely weak because they failed to serve the needs of the local churches. Local churches don't need them anymore, unfortunately. Other than for fellowship because churches today have all the resources available to them that the convention used to provide in other days. Churches don't need them for printing; churches don't need the conventions for missions. They don't need any assistance in the developments; financial development, architectural development, church planning. Black conventions don't have the resources to provide that. So people ask themselves, "Well, why are we giving our money to the convention?" So it's very challenged, the Baptist denominations, Baptist conventions are much challenged today because--and their numbers are diminishing, their influence is diminished tremendously. And also you exist in a way--you exist in a world today where you don't need a black president; you've got a president who is black. So that diminishes somewhat the leadership role of denominations, it changes it certainly.
Story_ID: 642099
Speaker 1: At Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia], what was your--was your major theology or, or?
Speaker 2: No, my major was socio- I had a sociology major actually and my--the urban development, urban planning.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. Now, what teachers or other students or figures at Virginia Union served as a role model for you or mentor for you?
Speaker 2: Well, there were several at Virginia Union. The president who--the gentleman who became president. When I first became a student at Virginia Union, Thomas Henderson was the president and he died in my freshman or thereabouts and A.B. James [Allix B. James] became president. When I became a student at Virginia Union, A.B. James was dean of the School of Religion [Virginia Union University Graduate School of Religion; Samuel DeWitt Proctor School of Theology of Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia] and I met him on my first week at the school, because you know Vietnam [Vietnam War] was going on and I wanted to get my training done, and I needed a deferment because I was at the age to be drafted. I went in and told Dr. James, A.B. James, who was the dean of the school at this time, that I wanted to get a 4D deferment and that, "I'm Reverend Richardson [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. W. Franklyn Richardson] from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]." He said, "Reverend? Where did you get the reverend from? When did you get to be some reverend?" So you know he put me down and put me in my place. He subsequently made the application and I got the 4D deferment because of the School of Religion, while I was in college. And so, but from that day on, he'd been an advocate and a mentor to me in my career development. He followed Thomas Henderson as the president of Virginia Union. He became the president of Virginia Union and did a lot to foster my ministry. Another influence was the former president, he wasn't president during my time, but he was a professor of sociology when I became a student. He was named John Malcolm Ellison [sic. John Malcus Ellison] who was the first African American president of Virginia Union. I took sociology from him, but I took more than that from him really. That's the only course I took from him, but he often became a person who counseled me and gave me good insight and advice on about how to go forward in ministry. Those--Pearl Mankins, I don't know if you knew her. She was a historian at Virginia Union. She also was a tremendously influential to me in terms of African American history.
Speaker 1: M-E-N-C--?
Speaker 2: Mankins, Pearl Mankins, M-A-N-K-I-N-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then there was several teachers that were encouraging to me, and who, who helped to nurture me at Virginia Union, (unclear). But A.B. James was the predomin- prominent person.
Story_ID: 642100
Speaker 1: You didn't get, get involved in the fraternities or any of that kind of thing at--?
Speaker 2: Well, the first year while I was a freshman, I did pledge for Alpha Omega P- no, Alpha, Alpha Phi Omega [Alpha Phi Omega Fraternity], which was a social, soc- which is a service fraternity but they had an initiation experience as well and so I became that, a member of that. But I never became a Greek because by the time I would have been eligible for Greek, I became pastor of Rising Mount Zion [Rising Mount Zion Baptist Church, Richmond, Virginia] at nineteen. My extra time went to being pastor and a student.
Speaker 1: Now did they have a black student organization in Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was vice president of student government when I got called to Rising Mount Zion, and subsequently I resigned or served out my term that year as vice president, but I never ran for president.
Speaker 1: Okay, now that's student government but I was asking about black student union.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Was there anything like that? A cultural (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We didn't need that because it was a black school, HBCU [historically black colleges and universities].
Speaker 1: Well, they had them in other schools now.
Speaker 2: Okay, student--what were their functions?
Speaker 1: Well, they--
Speaker 2: How did they function different from student government?
Speaker 1: Well, they hit upon issues that student government traditionally didn't.
Speaker 2: Oh really?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We didn't have one.
Speaker 1: They'd talk about curriculum, divestment from South Africa, a lot of different things (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay, we didn't have one of those. We did most of that kind of thing through the student government.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, so, now why did you decide to major in sociology in urban planning instead of--
Speaker 2: (Cough) Well, again I think it was Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]. I viewed that ministry--I wanted to have a social dynamic founding--foundation to my approach to the ministry and I was located in the most socially depressed area in Richmond [Virginia] as pastor. So any skills or insight that I could gain into understanding the environment, because I led protests, I led reform activities in that community. I marched on City Hall [Old City Hall, Richmond, Virginia], I marched on the housing authority [Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority], for all kind of things as it relates to that. So sociology was the undergraduate, I had a minor in religion, but the sociology was the main thing that I felt that would set the foundation for my future approach to ministry given what I saw ministry to be; and that's why I chose sociology.
Story_ID: 642101
Speaker 1: Was the Richmond Improvement Association still functioning?
Speaker 2: I think it was, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think it was.
Speaker 1: I know that they had been a little bit before that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's a little bit before that, yeah but I think I have some remembrance of it, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. And did you encounter when you were in undergraduate school Wyatt Tee Walker [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker] or--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, Wyatt was here in New York [New York], but he would come to Richmond [Virginia] either on campus or in the city. He was the most celebrated, one of the most celebrated preachers to come to Richmond during that period. He and Sam Proctor [Samuel DeWitt Proctor], they were the, they were the prominent pastors--successful, achieving pastors both of them from New York and when they'd come to town is was. So my best friend, Dwight Jones [Dwight Clinton Jones], and I we heard that Dr. Walker was coming to town and we got permission to pick him up at the airport because he was going to speak to us, speak to the school. And the president sent us to get Dr. Walker. From that day we became attached to him. He invited us to come preach for him. Wyatt Tee Walker probably had as much influence on the shape of my ministry today than anybody, because first of all he had a firsthand encounter with Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]. He was here in New York and he helped me to understand the global dimensions of ministry. I didn't have a myopic view of ministry, it was by local community. I saw ministry in a global context because of Wyatt Tee Walker. So I, I eventually started my travel in the world with Wyatt Tee Walker. He invited me to go Brazil, first trip my wife [Inez Nunnally Richardson] and I took out of the country, down in South America, the Bahias, the African remnants of slavery in Brazil. Then I became a member of the Central Committee, World Council of Churches and I invited Wyatt. I got Wyatt appointed to be the head of the racial equality commission for the World Council of Churches.
Speaker 1: That is much later though right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, much later. But Wyatt in my life was always a model mentor of what an effective and relevant and successful pastor ought to be from the day I met him. Given his theology, given his exposure to Martin Luther King, a church in Harlem [New York, New York], he was pastor of a Harlem church [Canaan Baptist Church]. He had been the assistant to Abyssinian [Abyssinian Baptist Church, New York, New York]; he had been publisher of a book company, Heritage, Black Heritage [sic. Negro Heritage Library]. So he was everything that I could think of a pastor being, and then to have access to him was even (unclear). And he was a double graduate of Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia]. So he was tremendously influential.
Story_ID: 642102
Speaker 1: Was Howard Thurman still alive in those days? 'Cause I know he was on the West Coast by then I think, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah Howard Thurman--I never met Howard Thurman, I heard about him but I never met him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I read his book, I'm familiar with him and have great admiration for him but I never met him.
Speaker 1: Okay and Gardner Taylor [HistoryMaker Reverend Gardner Taylor] was at Concord [Concord Baptist Church, Brooklyn, New York] (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now Gardner Taylor--when I came here, that's 1975, Gardner Taylor was here. Gardner had been huge. I knew of Gardner Taylor in 1969. When I was a pastor in Rising Mount Zion Church in Richmond [Rising Mount Zion Baptist Church, Richmond, Virginia] there was a deacon of the church and a teacher named Royster [ph.]. He had been a Pullman porter and he would talk about, "The greatest preacher in the African--in the world is Dr. Gardner C. Taylor," 'cause when he'd have his runs up in New York [New York], he'd go to Brooklyn [New York] and hear Gardner Taylor. He came back and told me about Gardner Taylor, "You never heard of Gardner Taylor? He was the greatest preacher who ever been in the history of black (unclear)." So I heard of Gardner Taylor before I knew Gardner Taylor. So I came to New York in 1975 and had the occasion to hear Gardner Taylor due to Lyman Beecher Lectures in 1979 at Yale Divinity School [New Haven, Connecticut]. I had just finished my undergrad, but for a year I had to fly back and forth to--maybe Gardner preached in '76 [1976], but anyway I had to fly back and forth to finish my degree at Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia] by the time I got here [Grace Baptist Church, Mount Vernon, New York]. I did that for a year and graduated and then I had, then I asked Gardner Taylor, who I got to be familiar with, and he recommended me to Yale Divinity School. That's how I got into Yale with his recommendation. And from a, from a preaching standpoint, I would say he's the greatest influence of me--on me on how to communicate the gospel and to understand the romance of preaching. And so he's been that kind of influence, the language of the pulpit. The picture he paints with words is extremely tremendous and that's influenced me a lot too. So Gardner Taylor was a major influence even though my role with him was more distant than it was with Wyatt [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker], less intimate but close enough. When I ran for president in the National Baptist Convention [National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.] a couple of times, he was always a counselor to me. You know he ran and lost, so he's--I'd go down to his house and we'd spend three or four hours talking about my campaign and so forth. So I always had access to him and I have copies of all his books that he wrote personal autographs to--telling me about what he thought of me and so forth. So we--it's been a great sharing with him.
Story_ID: 642103
Speaker 1: Now you became the pastor of Grace like as a very young man. Now--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, from what you're saying you were a pastor of Grace before you finished at Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Yep, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now how did this come about for such a young man?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Again it's like the, it's like the '69 [1969] episode right. I had done good and gotten recognition as pastor in Richmond [Virginia] at Rising Mount Zion [Rising Mount Zion Baptist Church], and consequently one of the pastors in Richmond knew of this church, under the former pastor, not my immediate predecessor but the former pastor, Shelton Doles [Shelton E. Doles] was the former pastor. And he heard that this church was vacant because the pastor who was my predecessor left and went to Brooklyn [New York]. He said, "Richardson [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. W. Franklyn Richardson] I want to recommend you to Grace church in Mount Vernon [Grace Baptist Church, Mount Vernon, New York]." I said, "Okay doc, I'll go up and speak." So he did, he recommended me and they decided that they wanted to have me come. So I came, I preached the second Sunday in July in 1974, and they asked me to come back in October. And my wife [Inez Nunnally Richardson] and I came back and they interviewed us and then they came to Richmond, a group of people came to Richmond and did due diligence, talked to the school, went to my church, visited us at our home, wonderful due diligence job that they did. And then in July--in January, they decided to put me up as one of the candidates, they had three candidates. One was a Tony in Detroit [Michigan], Tony Campbell [Anthony C. Campbell] in Detroit. He had a Ph.D. at the time. And then Irving Waters [Irving S. Waters] out of Portsmouth [Virginia], he was a graduate of Virginia Union, a master of divinity graduate. And they put me up. I was twenty-five with no degrees and I had a wife and a daughter [Katrina Richardson Epps]. And the congregation voted me as the pastor in January 19, 1975. I became pastor at Grace through the vote of the congregation.
Speaker 1: And you were like twenty-five years old?
Speaker 2: Twenty-five years old and it's been a wonderful journey. Been, been a tremendous privilege to be here and serve this congregation.
Story_ID: 642104
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about the history of this church. This church I think was founded in 1888 I believe?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1888 by five women probably former slaves, who were up here as domestics, they were domestics in Mount Vernon [New York]. And they couldn't go to the white churches, and so they organized the church in an old dancehall. Then eventually they had it up in the--white people let them have a Wednesday night service in the prayer room or something. Then they bought their own church for three thousand dollars in 1896, that the congregation built. So that's our origin from 1896 to 19--2012, 123 years now. And it's been on the basis of that simple faith of those five women. Grace [Grace Baptist Church, Mount Vernon, New York] is the mother church of this city. It's the first church--first African American congregation in the city and it's been a place out of which a lot of other churches have gone and grown in this area. It's been the primary--it's been the leading congregation for the--undeniably the leading congregation for the, since the 1880s. And it has always had a social activist slant to it. It was the first church who had a pastor who ran for elected office in this community. He ran for school board as a superin- as a--he didn't succeed but he ran. We had a former pastor who was the first black man in New York State to run for mayor in Mount Vernon. He didn't win either but it was the before taste of what would ultimately become. So Grace has had a very strong social consciousness and involvement in community development advocacy, and I've continued that in these thirty-seven years I've been here. We've been on the cutting edge--today we've become a regional congregation as opposed to just a Mount Vernon congregation, but we've been faithful to the Mount Vernon community still. Sixty percent of our members today come from other places other than Mount Vernon, so it's a regional church. But we still see our obligations to this local community and advocate on behalf of it. So that's what Grace has been. It's been a church that's been progressive, programmatic and we probably are at the precipice of our greatest moment, as we get ready to do this expansion. We are in the process of building a new cathedral, which will give us a hundred thousand square feet with both buildings. We're going to turn this sanctuary into a banquet hall. The church is busy seven days a week, so it's over eighty-nine ministries and small groups that do things all the time. So we have a school--Freedom School [Grace Children's Defense Fund Freedom Schools, Mount Vernon, New York] coming up to somewhere of six hundred students in that, we've got two community development corporations [Ujamaa Community Development Corporation, Mount Vernon, New York]. We built five hundred units of housing, $100 million worth of housing in this community. So Grace is a real engine for progress in, in this community.

Speaker 1: Now you were telling us about how you--that Dr. Walker [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker] helped you to get into Yale Divinity School [New Haven, Connecticut].
Speaker 2: Ya- Dr. Taylor [HistoryMaker Reverend Gardner Taylor].
Speaker 1: Dr. Taylor, okay. Yeah, all right, sorry, Dr. Gardner Taylor.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Gardner Taylor wrote the letter of recommendation, and he--and so you know I'm pastor of Grace [Grace Baptist Church, Mount Vernon, New York] and they accept me. And my unfolding has not been consistent. Here I am pastor of Rising Mount Zion [Rising Mount Zion Baptist Church, Richmond, Virginia] without a college degree and without being married and without experience, and now I'm at Grace in New York and I've not finished the college degree yet and still have obligations. So I finished the college degree while I'm at Grace, now I go to seminary, and seminary gets interrupted because by 1982 I'm elected general secretary of the National Baptist Convention [National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.]. So that shakes the whole foundation of my life because I did not anticipate becoming general secretary.
Speaker 1: Now you were at seminary in Yale?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right. While this is going on.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, the one thing we skipped over--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --is how you met your wife [Inez Nunnally Richardson].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And did you meet her at Virginia?
Speaker 2: I met her at Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia]. I met her in my sophomore year and we started seeing each other. So sophomore in the fall, in the spring, April 1969 I get called to Rising Mount Zion and we're seeing each other, we're courting. So now I'm pastor without a wife and so the next year--so I finally proposed to her and we get married in June of 1970, and we've been married now for forty-two years come this June. We had our first child [Katrina Richardson Epps] a year later, and she's been a tremendous partner to my life and to my ministry, strong counselor and confidante. So it's been a, it's been a good, good journey.
Story_ID: 642106
Speaker 1: Tell us about Yale Divinity School [New Haven, Connecticut]. Now you, you--?
Speaker 2: Well you know, let me tell you, to be very honest with you, when I first entered Yale I walked across campus and I, I almost had to pinch myself to believe that I had gotten to Yale Divinity School (laughter). I mean, that was as far from West Philadelphia High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] as you could be in your dreams. Here I am a student at Yale Divinity School, pinching myself and saying, "My god look at how far God has brought me." The great thing about Yale for me was, and I don't recommend it for every black preacher, but given the fact that I had spent my early years in the black church, I was familiar with the black church and I was at Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia], which is influenced, the environment is influenced because there were preachers all around. The whole school is grounded and its greatest contribution is to the African American church. And then I had been a pastor. So what Yale provided for me that I think was extraordinary was its capacity, the scholarship that I could bring to a text that I was taught to bring to a text. The exegetical skills, the approach to understand the Bible. Yale provided for me the scholarship that I needed to push my ministry to the next level. At the time that I went to Yale, they were looking for black students and so I had all the assistance I could have. It was a wonderful place. They provided me with scholarship, they provided me with an apartment so that I could commute back and forth from here [Mount Vernon, New York]. But half way through that, I got elected general secretary of the National Baptist Convention [National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.], 1982, which is unusual too because here I now the chief operating officer of the denomination of 1982 and I don't have seminary degree. But they elected me and I served under Dr. T.J. Jemison. Dr. Jemison was the president. His father, D.V. Jemison, had been president before J.H. Jackson [Joseph H. Jackson]. So I did that for thirteen years and that gave me so much unbelievable exposure. I mean it sharpened every skill I had, it challenged every skill I had, every potential I had in me. It gave me exposure to the World Council of Churches where I represented the denomination on the World Council of Churches, and it gave me--all over the world representing the denomination--representing the World Council of Churches and the denomination in the World Council of Churches. I became a member of the Central Committee of the World Council as a result of being--representing our denomination. It gave me national exposure that I just never dreamed of having. Being in Jet magazine and Ebony magazine and being invited to preach all over the world and all places just because one day your life changed, that was just--it was just that dramatic. It took me six months to get my feet back down on the ground after they elected me general secretary. You see your name up in the marquees at the convention and your name on the banners. You have responsibility. It was just a huge transformation, the most dramatic day of my life. It's changed everything from that day, it's a watershed moment. Everything from that day changed in my life, the promise, the potential as a result of being elected general secretary.
Speaker 1: What role did T.J. Jemison play again?
Speaker 2: He was the president.
Speaker 1: He was the president okay, when you became the general secretary (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah and he became, he became my denominational mentor. You know, he, he nurtured my development as a denominational leader.
Speaker 1: So this is 1982?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 642107
Speaker 1: Now and you went to Yale Divinity School [New Haven, Connecticut], you started there in 19- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Seventy-nine [1979].
Speaker 1: --seventy-nine [1979], okay, '79 [1979], okay. All right I just wanted to make--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Get my dates here. All right so, and you said Reverend Jemison was the son of the former president [D.V. Jemison] of the National Baptist Convention [National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah. And he was general secretary for twenty-nine years under J.H. Jackson [Joseph H. Jackson]. T.J. Jemison was general secretary under T.J. Jemison--under J.H. Jackson for twenty-nine years and I succeeded him as general secretary.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So this interrupts your studies at Yale.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well, you know while doing studies at Yale and I'm pastoring Grace [Grace Baptist Church, Mount Vernon, New York], I'm doing two things. So we put--the first several years we put the seminary thing on the back burner, and I'd take on this responsibility that has huge consequences--has global consequences because not only am I general secretary and chief operating officer, but we built a new headquarters, we built--we have the whole foreign mission department, we have a publishing department [National Baptist Publishing Board; R.H. Boyd Publishing Corporation, Nashville, Tennessee] and we have annual meetings, three of them a year that I'm responsible for. I have an office now in Nashville, Tennessee at the headquarters that we built, and I commute from here in New York and all over to wherever I had to go. So it was really time consuming. But after about five or six years I got my hands around it enough that I could go back to Yale. They readmitted me and I went back and finished and graduated, I think in '91 [1991], got the degree in '91 [1991] almost ten years after I left. Then from there I then enrolled in Dayton [United Theological Seminary, Dayton, Ohio] where I earned a doctorate of ministry degree all this is while I'm secretary of the denomination.
Speaker 1: Now, now you have to explain to me, I don't quite understand, now the degree in Yale isn't that a terminal degree in ministry?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no. Master of divinity is what they give out at Yale and a master of arts in religion. But those--it used to be prior to--the D.Min is a recent--fairly recent degree. M.Div used to be the terminal degree in divinity. After the M.D. you could go and get a master's in theology or you could go get a Ph.D. in some form of religion. But there was no sequential degree above the master's of divinity degree. About ten, fifteen years ago the accreditation authorities estab- felt that there was a need for a terminal degree in ministry and they established--the experimental degree was--the experiment for the D.Min was at Colgate Rochester [Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School, Rochester, New York] and Wyatt Tee Walker [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker], H. Beecher Hicks [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. H. Beecher Hicks, Jr.], Otis Moss [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Otis Moss, Jr.], Jim Forbes [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. James A. Forbes, Jr.], William Shaw [William J. Shaw], Bill Jones [William A. Jones, Jr.], Harold Carter [Harold A. Carter, Sr.], a guy down here at the Presbyterian church in Harlem [New York, New York], I can't think of his name, I know he died, about twelve of them under Henry Mitchell's [HistoryMaker Reverend Henry Mitchell] mentoring were the first group to posture the D.Min. After they did their D.Min, the D.Min became more broadly affirmed by seminaries. So then you had the Dayton program established, Sam Proctor [Samuel DeWitt Proctor] established the Dayton program. Then Virginia Union [Samuel DeWitt Proctor School of Theology of Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia] has one today, Howard [Howard University School of Divinity, Washington, D.C.] has one today. Many schools have D.Min programs today. So now the D.Min is the terminal degree in ministry. So you have a master of divinity, you have a doctor in ministry. And so, I went to Yale for the master's; then I went to Dayton for the doctorate in ministry, which was the terminal.
Story_ID: 642108
Speaker 1: Who were some of the professors, I guess, that were you know mentors or guides in both degrees, I guess?
Speaker 2: At Yale [Yale Divinity School, New Haven, Connecticut]?
Speaker 1: Yale and Dayton [United Theological Seminary, Dayton, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Well, at Yale there was a South African preacher who was my New Testament professor, oh I can't think of his name. He was tremendous; he helped me a lot to capture the New Testament nuances. I even had him come preach here once [at Grace Baptist Church, Mount Vernon, New York]; I can't remember his name right now, Malherbe, Dr. Malherbe [Abraham J. Malherbe].
Speaker 1: How do you--can you spell that?
Speaker 2: Malherbe, M-A-L-H-E-R-B-E. Malherbe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a tremendous professor. There's an old man named Roland [Roland H. Bainton], first name Roland, I can't think of his last name, Bryan [sic.] I think it was. He was the senior pastor--senior professor there at Yale, he was very helpful. Those are two that I remember. I had a guy an Old Testament professor named, I can't think of his name, oh my god. Yeah, you're pushing me way back. But he was an excellent guy too, I can't think of his name now. So those are, I think, my dominant influences at Yale, were the--certainly Malherbe. I really think I'm more of a New Testament preacher than--even though I preach from both, but I think I'm more skilled as a New Testament preacher. But anyway. At Dayton naturally my--I came into Dayton, even though I did not have D.Min, I came in to do a special role. They invited me to Dayton, given my experience, my broad experiences as general secretary [of the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.] and around the world and all that stuff like that, they invited me to get my degree and serve as a cohort--as a co-mentor with Wyatt Tee Walker [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker] to the Wyatt Tee Walker fellows. So my first encounter at Dayton was as a student co-mentor. So I was earning my degree and at the same time I was mentoring others who were seeking their degrees based on my experience and broad exposure. And they invited me to that, Wyatt wanted me to do it and they invited me. So I was the mentor and student. The second time around, the thing was called Walker Richardson Fellowship [ph.]. So we had a second group of cohorts. First time it was called the Wyatt Tee fellow, and the second time it was called Walker Richardson fellow because by the time I got to (unclear), I had my own doctorate degree and Wyatt had asked me to do it again and that time it became--so that's how I--. And so at Dayton, you know, at Dayton was not so much a professor classroom, your mentor is the closest thing you have to a professor and you have a project that you have to develop. My project was on the black church and community development and how the church engages. The book is in the library that was my dissertation. So--
Speaker 1: I was smiling because I'm just thinking it must be great to work on your Ph.D. and you know you've got it made.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, I guess so.
Speaker 1: Okay, black church and community development that would be like a dissertation.
Speaker 2: That was my dissertation, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. What were your conclusions?
Speaker 2: Well, I think first of all I concluded that the--that there had been a historical role in the church in community development. Secondly, that it was a biblically mandated role. Thirdly, that there continues to be a role for the church and that community development corporations may be the vehicle. So my project was actually the development of the community development corporation [Ujamaa Community Development Corporation, Mount Vernon, New York]. That here--in theory it was development but in practicality today it's $100 million worth of housing and other kinds of things that go on in the community. So that's basically what my conclusions were, that the church had a role in economic development and in developing communities and in creating housing for the needy and so forth.
Story_ID: 642109
Speaker 1: So we're--
Speaker 2: (Cough).
Speaker 1: --we're in the early '90s [1990s] now, so, well I know in '85 [1985], you know before we got to the conclusion, you had your ten year celebration and I think the church had its hundred--in '88 [1988] had its hundred year celebration (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: But also in '85 [1985], that's when your brother [Ron Richardson] passed.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: No, I'm sorry he won the Tony Award [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre].
Speaker 2: (Cough) He won the Tony Award in '85 [1985], and died in '97 [sic. 1995] I think.
Speaker 1: Right, right, he won the Tony Award in the '80s [1980s], '85 [1985] I think it was, for 'Big River' [William Hauptman] and he played the character of Jim?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Huckleberry Finn' ['The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,' Mark Twain] basically is the story.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, hundredth anniversary of Grace [Grace Baptist Church, Mount Vernon, New York] was in '88 [1988]. Now, tell us about the Martin Luther King, Jr. Board of Ministers [Board of Ministers and Laity].
Speaker 2: It was--the undergraduate school at Morehouse [Martin Luther King, Jr. College of Ministers and Laity] wanted to find a way to attach preachers to the King chapel [Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel]. The King chapel is an ecumenical chapel and they wanted to find a way to connect African Americans, primarily [HistoryMaker] Lawrence Carter who is the dean of chapel. They wanted to find ways to connect them so he created--they created--Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] created what they call the King fellow, the King school--the--what is it called? The Martin Luther King--
Speaker 1: Board of Ministers.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Board of Ministers. They built it around this (unclear); you see it on my wall over there, this (unclear) chart that talks about the code of moral conduct. It's an honor, you have to be inducted into it and it's based on the criteria that are established by the college, and they induct outstanding ministers; people who are serving in the tradition of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]. It's an honorific title, there are no functioning activities associated with it. It's like the honor society for preachers. So I was inducted in 1986 is it?
Speaker 1: Eighty-nine [1989].
Speaker 2: Eighty-nine [1989]. Well, Dr. Jemison under his leadership, we built the King statue. You know the King statue, it's on the plaza of the King chapel. It's the most photographed monument to Martin Luther King standing in front of the chapel. That was donated by National Baptist Convention [National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.] under Dr. T.J. Jemison, the King statue. At the base of it--it's on Italian marble, his name and my name are the names that are on the base of that monument. So I've had that association with Morehouse and then last year at baccalaureate, last May they unveiled my portrait to hang in the, in the King, in the gallery at King chapel, this past May, May 2011.
Story_ID: 642110
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about some of your act- activities with the World Council of Churches.
Speaker 2: That was an exciting cer- period in my life. It started in, at Vancouver [Canada] in 1983, when I was elected to the Central Committee of the World Council of Churches. I was sent there by Dr. Jemison [T.J. Jemison] to represent our denomination. I did mostly all the world travel for National Baptist [National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.] for the thirteen years he was president because he had a phobia of--for flying and so he would send me to represent the denomination. I got elected general secretary--I mean I got elected Central Committee member. That's thirty people who govern the World Council of Churches, governing board. It meets every seven years but the thirty people actually govern the board. So I ended up having to go--one of the wonderful things about being a member doing the committee work, is that you saw all of the denominations not just--all Christian, but not just American denominations. You saw the Orthodox in Ethiopia; you saw the various forms in Europe of Christian faith. You had some dialogue with Catholics, the Catholics don't belong to the World Council of Churches, but they do serve as observers and have interplay and we have discussions. I visited one time and spoke in Russia, in the Soviet Union during the time that communism was in place and Christianity had to be underground. I remember coming back from Russia and one of the great themes was faith and wholeness of the world. The place where faith and science intersect, or faith and medicine intersect on behalf of the quality of life of people, and how we were to foster that. So it was--to see the faith community from the prism of different countries, and different dialects, different cultures was a wonderful and enlightening experience in my travels with the Central Committee of the World Council of Churches. It was a welcoming kind of experience, mind expanding.
Story_ID: 642111
Speaker 1: Two thousand and three [2003], Grace [Grace Baptist Church, Mount Vernon, New York] opened another church in Port St., St. Lucie?
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter), that was interesting. For a couple of years prior to 2003, we had members to move, you know it was a great, kind of a migration; it didn't last long, the recession cut it off. But there was a kind of a migration of blacks from the North back to the South. It was prominent in New York because in New York you had people who would have retired, they'd get retirement benefits at New York levels, which is some of the highest in the country. They had homes that were worth a lot of money, so they could sell the homes, move to the South, buy better homes--a larger home for a third of the money that they sold their homes there. The other two thirds of the money they could put in the bank. They got a retirement check that's coming at New York rates when the cost of living is maybe 70 percent of the New York rates where they are going. So it's a no brainer, if they are willing to make the change and give up some of the things that they've known. But that stopped when the recession came. Well consequently during that period, I had members to move all over the South and a group of them ended up clustering in Port St. Lucie, Florida and they would come back on a regular basis and ask me would I start a church 'cause there wasn't an African American church there that was suitable for them, da, da, da, da, da. I kept resisting, I'd tell them I'd never started a church, I don't know anything about starting a church. But they were endless in their pursuit and so finally I told them, I said, "Well, if you get fifty people to sign a letter, I'll come down and talk." But I just assumed that would stop and make them leave me alone. Well, they got a hundred people to sign the letter. So I was committed to go, and I went down in 2003 and talked with them and their sincerity was contagious and their desire to have a church was--I could not ignore it. And I told them I don't know anything about starting, but I'll come and work with you. So I said I'll come every Wednesday night, we'll have a service on Wednesday nights so we can begin to build bonding and build some community and start talking our way through it. Fifteen months later they decided that we should have on Sunday, a Sunday service in the afternoon 'cause we were using a school--not school, senior citizen building and Sunday afternoon was available, we couldn't get Sunday morning. So when that happened then I had to start sending my staff 'cause I couldn't be absent from here every Sunday. So I would pick one Sunday a year, one Sunday a month I would go there. In other words I would take--come here, preach my 7:30 service, show my face at my 9:30 service, someone else would preach the 11:30 service. I would go to the airport, fly to West Palm Beach [Florida]. A car would take me up to the service in Port St. Lucie by three o'clock and we'd have service in Port St. Lucie at three o'clock. Then the other Sundays I would send staff to go and then I was always there for all the special days, I did revivals and so on. Well after five years--no after--this was five years 'cause it was fifteen months, then it was another fifteen months we did that. And then they decided or we decided that they want, they say they wanted a regular minister to come so they would know who was going to be there every Sunday. Surprisingly at the same time my son, who is already in ministry, said, "Dad, why don't you let me run the Port St. Lucie church for you?" After some reluctance and back and forth I assigned him to go there. He loved it, he moved to Port--Florida, so he's been there--this weekend they will celebrate his fifth year pastoral leader. So it's one church in two locations. Well, actually now in three locations, we have it also a congregation in Yonkers [Faith Mission Grace Baptist Church, Yonkers, New York]. But it's one church in three locations and he's in Port St. Lucie. The church is doing quite well, we are now up to 250 members, and we bought ten acres of land. It's subsidized by New York for all of its life, but it's getting closer and closer to being unsubsidized because it is self, self sufficient. But that's how I ended up in Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your son is Reverend William F. Richardson--
Speaker 2: The third [William F. Richardson III] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) the third.
Story_ID: 642112
Speaker 1: Tell me about the Children's Defense Fund Freedom School [Grace Children's Defense Fund Freedom Schools, Mount Vernon, New York].
Speaker 2: Oh man, wonderful. As you know [HistoryMaker] Marian Wright Edelman who worked with Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] in the Civil Rights Movement, one of the byproducts of the movement was she created--well she had a concern that the children of the future would be in better conditions as a result of civil rights and that there continued to be racism that affected children. So she created the Children's Defense Fund [Washington, D.C.] with the purpose of trying to protect children, advocating on behalf of children; legislation, programs and so forth. One of the byproducts of her program is she ended up creating what we call Freedom Schools. Freedom Schools are the result of her passion for the children. I learned about Freedom School, I was invited--she bought the Haley Farm [Alex Haley Farm; Children's Defense Fund Haley Farm, Clinton, Tennessee] and they have retreats there once--annually and other times, but there's a Proctor, Sam Proctor retreat [Samuel DeWitt Proctor Institute for Child Advocacy Ministry] that she invited me, they invited me to come speak. While I was there, I was exposed to Freedom Schools. And when I heard about Freedom Schools I was so impacted and influenced that I decided that I would ask our staff to look into how we could do that--we had to have Freedom Schools. So ten years ago we started our first Freedom School. Freedom School is a summer program, six weeks, that's designed to complement public education and to put self esteem into the students. It's based on African motifs; it's written--it's designed for--with a curriculum that's designed for motivation, self esteem. All of the authors are black authors. They get twelve books they read in the course of six weeks. They're exposed to successful African American leaders from mayors to doctors to lawyers to pastors. They come in the mornings and read to them. They go on field trips that are designed to motivation. The whole curriculum, we bring, we take college students, send them to Haley Farm and train them on how to be Freedom School facilitators, and then when the summer comes, we hire the college students to teach the Freedom School scholars. We started out with fifty, then we went to 100, then we went to 150, last year we had six hundred and this year we're going to have six hundred. It cost us about one thousand dollars a student; we don't charge the parents anything. The parents have to pay by--they have to be every Tuesday night at parenting meetings where we give them skills on how to be better parents, more effective parents and so forth. There are so many transformational stories of kids whose lives turned around as a result of Freedom School. Kids who weren't interested in education, weren't interested in school, they go to Freedom School, they go back and the teachers tell us they can't believe the transformation. Some kids had given up on getting an education but Freedom School provides--because Freedom School affirms your identity. It celebrates your blackness, it tells you the story of the struggles of our people. So it's a wonderful place. I'm a total advocate of it. I mean, I wish that every black community in America had the resources to have Freedom Schools. So we, we have sustained this for ten years; we're going to have a ten year anniversary this year of Freedom Schools here in Mount Vernon [New York] that--sponsored by Grace [Grace Baptist Church] and our community development corporation [Ujamaa Community Development Corporation, Mount Vernon, New York].
Story_ID: 642113
Speaker 1: Tell us about the National Action Network.
Speaker 2: I have--again it goes to our close relationship with Wyatt Walker [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker]. Wyatt Walker was the chairman, the founding chairman with Al Sharpton [HistoryMaker Reverend Al Sharpton] on the National Action Network twenty years ago. When he became chairman of the board, or when he started as chairman the board was formed, he asked me to serve as vice chairman, Wyatt did and Al. So I have been associated with the National Action Network for the last twenty years. When Wyatt became ill and could no longer function, he resigned from the board and recommended me to become chairman of the board of the National Action Network, which I have been now for eight years or so. And we had watched the evolution of not only Al Sharpton, but the evolution of the National Action Network. The National Action Network today has forty-seven chapters around the country. We are involved in being a voice for the voiceless, issues of injustice. When nobody else will take it on, we'll take it on and profilers--blacks are being profiled, whether blacks are being killed, and nobody is being challenged, nobody steps into the void. So the National Action Network under Al's leadership has been very effective. I've been there as the chairman transforming the organization. We've had, the last eight years have been a huge transformation. Just yesterday I had a planning meeting for a retreat we're getting to have to take the organization to another level. This year--last year we had one of our best conventions with President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] and six cabinet people came at different times to speak to our convention. So the National Action Network has gotten to a place of prominence in America and Al's own role as being a voice is undeniable. So the National Action Network is on the cutting edge of social justice issues and is in a state of evolving, it's not static and it's becoming more and more. We have a Washington [D.C.] bureau now with staff, we have an Atlanta [Georgia] office, we have a California office. And as I said our goal is 100 chapters, we're in the process of building it into a stronger unit to speak on behalf of our people.
Speaker 1: Okay I know the National Action Network took the lead on the Amadou Diallo case.
Speaker 2: Yeah Amadou Diallo, the case right here in Queens [sic. Bronx, New York], a couple of cases in Queens we've done. One of them is the most celebrated and I can't think of his name right now. A young man was shot coming out of a nightclub on the night of his wedding--the night before his wedding. I know his name just like I know the back of my hand, but I can't--. Then we have taken leadership and stepped into the Trayvon Martin situation.
Speaker 1: It seems as though it's official--official misconduct is the target of National Action Network (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes that's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: --for the most part. Police brutality and--
Speaker 2: Yeah. Miscarriages of justice.

Speaker 1: What are your thoughts on the Tray- Trayvon Martin case, which is going on--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right now (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) it's, it's preparing for trial as we speak.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well, I think the first step which is what we accomplished was to not let it--before, before we stepped into it there was no case because the officials had decided that there was no basis, no cause to bring charges. And that he didn't need to be charged, he didn't need to be arrested. They say that to the parents [Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin] and to his lawyer that we're not bringing any charges, this is done. Well then we were marching from Selma [Alabama] to Alabama [Montgomery, Alabama] when Al got the call that he needed to--would he come and look at the situation and that is when the case started. When he went in to Florida--that's the other thing that we do, we can bring attention. Al Sharpton [HistoryMaker Reverend Al Sharpton] is such a media magnet that he can bring attention to anything that he focuses on. So when he brought attention on it, it all of a sudden became big and that's when the governor decided to appoint a special prosecutor [Angela Corey] once we got in it. Then we kept putting visibility, thirty-five thousand people to rally, kept on exposing it, made it a huge situation where they had to address it. So the first goal was to get charges brought against this, not let this be swept under the rug. That it put in the due process of American law. The challenges going forward is who do you trust, in what ways do you trust the system to be all it ought to be because it is imperfect. And though we got the charges, we don't have any guarantee we're going to get any kind of justice because if this fellow walks away without any kind of punishment--
Speaker 1: This is George Zimmerman.
Speaker 2: Yeah George Zimmerman. (Cough) If he walks away without any kind of--then we've been--we missed the, we missed the target for justice. It's our opinion that something and we want to trust the system and to say what that something is. But you know at least the light is being brought on the situation and we think that light will expose the dark, it will expose the, the evil.
Story_ID: 642115
Speaker 1: And so we're hopeful, we're not certain that the system will serve this because, you know more and more things are evolving out and if it comes down to who do you believe the dead man or the man who is speaking alive and happens to be white and the dead man happens to be black, who do you, who do you believe? And just recently when they mentioned about the scars or afflicted injuries on George Zimmerman, you know these--if this, this can't be new to the prosecutor. The prosecutor I'm sure knew about it when they brought the charges. One of things that I question now is did the prosecutor bring a charge that was unwinnable. Did she overreach, you know did she bring a charge--can she win second degree murder or could she have won first degree manslaughter? Because if you can bring a charge that you can't win, it's the same as letting him go. The way she has treated this--Michele Anderson in Florida, you know the young lady who just got twenty years for the same--for standing her ground against her husband who tried to--she just shot at him, she didn't shoot him. Same stand your ground principle and she got twenty years, she didn't kill him but he was abusive to her. This prosecutor [Angela Corey] who is the prosecutor for Trayvon Martin is responsible for her getting twenty years for shooting at her husband. So the question becomes for me, an overreach in charge is just like letting the guy go. So that's why I say to you I'm not certain that--what this means and I'm certain how Trayvon Martin is going to come out and whether or not justice will be served. I hope my suspicions aren't warranted. But given what she was willing to tolerate in the Anderson case or Alexander [sic.] case makes me wonder whether or not she's really going to be pushing for a conviction even though she's saying all the right things a conviction in Trayvon Martin.
Speaker 2: Okay, to underline all this is, I guess is white male privilege, I guess.
Speaker 1: Sure, sure, man. We got to work our way through, as I was telling a guy yesterday, the problem with American slavery was that it was associated with color and I don't know how far we have to run before we can out run it. The consequences, the fall out of the ripple effect of slavery and racism, how it continues to haunt us and affect the systems and institutions of this country.
Story_ID: 642116
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about the--now you're, you're the chair now of the Conference of National Black Churches.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes. Conference of National Black Churches is thirty years old. It's the coming together of the nine historically black denominations. The A.M.E.'s [African Methodist Episcopal], the A.M.E. Zions [African Methodist Episcopal Zion], the C.M.E.s [Christian Methodist Episcopal], the Church of God in Christ, the National Baptist, USA [National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.], the Progressive Baptist [Progressive National Baptist Convention, Inc.], the National Baptist Missionary [National Missionary Baptist Convention of America], the National Baptist of America [National Baptist Convention of America International, Inc.] and the Full Gospel Baptist [Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship International]. All of them come together around four areas; education, the quality of life areas for African Americans, not around religion, they all have their own nuances of theology. But around education, social justice, economic development and health. So the CNBC, Conference of National Black Churches, exists to advocate on behalf of the denominations, on behalf of the people of African American community as an extension of the denominations. I serve as the chairman of that group. We're getting ready to have a big meeting and consultation in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] on the 30th of May and it's designed to put programming on behalf of churches in those four areas. We're now extended in our effort because of the nature of the black church. All the life in the church is no longer in the confines of denominations. So now we've extended it to independent churches, to caucuses within white denominations, black caucuses within white denominations, and direct church affiliations. So it's changing a little bit what it's going to be, but it's really the collective presence of the black church to address collectively social justice, education, health and economic aspects of African American community.
Speaker 1: Does it do some of the functions that the SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] used to do?
Speaker 2: No, because SCLC was social justice, I guess to some degree National Action Network does social justice like SCLC used to do. I think the National Action Network is probably the nearest thing to a successor if (unclear), SCLC still exists, but they don't do what National Action Network does. The National Action Network finds itself, grounds itself in the King tradition--it's Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] influenced. I guess there is nobody that does what CNBC does because it's the only place where all the religious leaders come together. There is no other place, no other table where all of the black churches sits down together, CNBC provides that. So they know each other, they gather around these issues that ought not divide us because we're not fighting over whether you're baptized or sprinkled or whether you're serve communion upstairs or downstairs, at night or at noon. We don't fight over styles of worship; we, we come together around the social issues that affect our people.
Story_ID: 642117
Speaker 1: Does CNBC [Conference of National Black Churches] or, or have you in your career ever been involved with trying to organize the, our black storefront churches some of which--I know there was something a few years ago called the national Ten Point Coalition and Reverend Rivers [HistoryMaker Reverend Eugene Rivers] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: --had it in Boston [Massachusetts] where he tried to organize the small churches around social justice issues in the neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean that's an ambitious goal, it's fraught with all--it's fraught with fundamentally--you cannot get people, churches to do what they don't understand, what the scripture mandates them to do. And so if you have a flawed--if a church has a theology that does not encompass social justice or community engagement, you can organize all you want but that's not what they see themselves as being. And very few storefront churches have any sense of social justice because they're usually so small. One of the problems with denominations today is that all the resources of denominations go into maintaining the engines of the denomination. So they don't have no money left over to do these things that we're talking about. And a local, a storefront church is struggling with its budget to exist. It doesn't have excess to do social justice; it doesn't have competencies to do social justice. It's a missed parity; it doesn't have any parities with the corporate entities of society. It doesn't have, have--in most cases it doesn't have informed, socially informed leadership, it doesn't have excess staff, usually it's a one person operation. It has limited money trying to pay his rent and pay the light bill and it doesn't usually have excess revenue. I mean you're proposing something that is really--it's being put upon a people of the church, which is not something that flows out of their understanding of their self identity. They don't see themselves as being a social entity. They don't see themselves as being an advocate for justice. I know plenty of storefront churches, but they don't--that's not their view of what the church is. They are very into personal spirituality and, and to--the first stop before social justice is service. So if it's anything other than spiritual development, its service they might do some service stuff. But talking about doing social justice and speaking out against violence and taking on gangs--that's foreign to their self, self, self profile.
Story_ID: 642118
Speaker 1: Just bouncing off again the, the educational I guess grounding for a pastor like yourself, there's been a lot of talk this week the fact about President Obama's [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] support of gay marriage, and a lot of rhetoric around whether the black church you know can support such a notion because of its traditional view of theology or its--a limited view which is--so we have like two tradition--we have like one tradition where the black view of theology is elevated even beyond the countries and then we have another view of black folks accepting the theology that is much smaller or much more limiting the rest of the country. So what do you think about that?
Speaker 2: Well, two or three things. First of all President Obama's statement didn't change anything. No new laws got changed. No--whatever was happening before continues to happen after he made the statement. It was his opinion; he's the president of the United States. His opinion ought to have influence and impact but it was his opinion. At the end of the day it was his opinion, it was not a law to be passed, it didn't change anything. Having said that however, the church in America, the black church in particular, is pluralistic. We live in a pluralistic society. Pluralism among the African American faith community is, is high. So what you have in the African American church is diverse theologies, no single theology speaks for the African American church, and no single theology speaks for it on the issues of same sex marriage. However, no matter what the theological position of the local congregation is, it does not have its theology mandated by public policy. So it doesn't make any difference what the public policy is, the church--Rome [Vatican City] does not inform Jerusalem. The church forms its own theology and theology is often--the theology of the temple is often in conflict with the policy of the court--the king's court. So, so the point is that the church continues to hold its theological position no matter what the public policy becomes, and it does not look for the church to be informed by public policy to formulate theology. And there is in the black church a diverse theology around same sex marriage as you indicated. The second thing is that the church cannot expect that it can use public policy to legislate its values or opinions, its theology. So if a church believes or doesn't believe in same sex marriage, it can't force the public policy--it ought not try to force public policy to enforce its values--to legislate its values. Because the modus operandi of the church is not to legislate its beliefs, but to preach its beliefs and have people to convert on their free will as to the beliefs of the church. So on one hand public policy doesn't inform theology and theology ought not inform public policy. Final thing, the quest for freedom and justice and liberty is so profound in the human spirit that it's irrepressible, and no matter what anybody does to suppress the right for people to be free, ultimately their pursuit for freedom will be achieved. As African Americans, as African American religious people, we cannot afford to endorse any climate that takes away the rights of people to make their own decisions because we've been the victims of that. We should know it better than anybody else. So my opinion is that I know what our theology is in the church, but I'm on the side of every person in America choosing what they want to do, what they want to believe, what values they want to affirm. As long as it is not detrimental to the health or wellbeing of the general society, a person ought to be free to marry whoever they want to. Now is that my position as a pastor? No it's not my position in terms of what I believe theologically, but it's certainly my position in public policy that a person ought to be free to do whatever they want to do. And I have a responsibility if I feel so convicted by my values that I have to turn up my game and become a better salesman for my values on the thing I believe so that people, more people will accept it. But we cannot sit back and think that the theological values of the church, first of all they aren't singular, they're not monolithic, they're diverse, can be found in public policy. So as a president, the president did what the president ought to do and that is come down on the side of people being free in this democratic society to make their own choices about what they want to do.
Story_ID: 642119
Speaker 1: We always ask this question.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all my view of the context of the African American community today is, is, I'm somewhat, I'm somewhat despaired. And I say that because we are revisiting some of the things that we thought that we'd already won. Some of the victories we thought we'd already achieved, we find ourselves having to step back and revisit them again. Also the despair rises out of the fact that from an economic standpoint the needle has moved very little in the masses of black people since 1954 'til today. The economic situation of black people, the masses, not the few, but the masses continue to be about what it was in 1954. I'm also concerned--is also--this despair is born of the fact that two hundred--that 2 million black men today are felons, which means they have no right to vote, they can't get a job, they can't be on juries and if their families get public assistance they can't live at home. I'm concerned because public school systems are in disarray in most cities in African American--most urban communities. The cities--the school systems are at an all time low, ineffective. Our school systems provide a blueprint for the building of our prisons. We decide in third grade what--how many prisons we're going to need based on third grade population and statistics, cradle to the grave--cradle prison role [cradle to prison pipeline]. So these things are concerning me. I do not think that there insurmountable, I'm not driven to ultimate despair but I have great concerns for how we address these. We know that racism is still a prominent reality in our community. The election of President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] as president of the United States has given an opportunity for us to get a good glimpse of how much it's still present in American society. And we made, he has made progress and we have symbolically made progress, but the forces that seek to turn them back are waiting tomorrow for him to get out of office, whether it's in four years or whether it's this November. So that they can jump upon it and turn it back. The hatred level in this country is at an all time high, and I don't know how divided we'll be at the end of this election cycle. So I have great concerns about the future of African Americans, but I have great confidence that we have the capacity to address these things if we can begin to focus on them and see them. We have resources as well, we have economic resources, we spend $1.3 trillion in our consumer spending in America. We get our hands around that. We do have social institutions that are viable and vibrant. We have tools--we have some things to work with. We've got to do a better job of educating our parents in how they take on responsibility for our children. We've got to spend our money smarter than we've been spending it. We've got to make education a priority. I don't know what we do for the 2 million men who are felons, how do we get our hands around them and put them and their offspring in the direction so that they don't recycle the same kind of habits and behaviors that got them to be felons. I do know that the productivity of felons, black felons is a result of what Michelle Alexander calls in her book ['The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness'] the new Jim Crow, where the systems work to foster black men as felons. There're disproportionate numbers of black men who are felons than there are whites who do the same crimes. So I go forward, encouraged by my spirituality, believing my faith gives me the optimism, but I go with my eyes open to the realities we've got to face. I think the future is yet, even with all the things I just pointed, the future is still promising. I think there's some potential; I think there is some redistribution or some doors of redistribution of wealth at certain levels. There are blacks that oversee or are over corporations today that we never thought--multimillion dollar corporations, Fortune 500 corporation.
Story_ID: 642120
Speaker 1: For the last twelve years I served on the board of the--advisory board of PepsiCo. That was created to advocate greater participation in Corporate America through--in the areas of procurement, marketing and HR [human resources]. And as a result of that, we've been able to see the redistribution of money into the African American community. The--during our tenure we got the vendor spending for minorities up to a billion two [$1.2 billion] from three or four hundred thousand, three or four hundred million [dollars]. We've been able to see African Americans advance in every rank of the corporate strata, as well as been advocating for blacks in marketing. Now, we've had some failures and we've had some setbacks but that's one area that I have been trying to give input. Similarly, I'm on the diversity council for Comcast/NBCUniversal where we're part of the memorandum of understanding that was met by NBC and Comcast [Comcast Corporation] with the National Action Network, NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and the Urban League [National Urban League]. And the MOU [memorandum of understanding] requires that they have measurable and significant achievement in the areas of procurement, marketing or television network and in the area of HR. So we've been doing this for about a year and we're examining--one of the areas that they got--made the most improvement is in vendor and HR. We just recently launched two African American networks. One was Aspire with Magic Johnson, and Revolt with Puffy Combs, Sean Combs [P. Diddy]. Two African American networks that are a result of the MOU relationship. So, you know I'm encouraged because there are avenues, you've got to keep working at it every day, but I think we have some places where we can begin, and activities that will begin to open up some doors.
Story_ID: 642121
Speaker 1: Now is, is there a project that you haven't been involved in that you would like to see the church or support you would like (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I'm involved in one that's very new and very important, I think. It's sponsored by the Conference of National Black Churches. So two years, two years and $2 million we have created a platform called Our Faith Empowers, and it's designed to take the economic resources, this $1.1 trillion that goes to the African American community and, and recycle it. A dollar in the Asian community stays for thirty days, a dollar in the Jewish community stays for nineteen days, this is based on scientific research, and a dollar in the African American community stays for six hours. So we don't leverage, our money goes in our community and out. It's based on this concept that we created, this whole notion of economic justice at the Conference of National Black Churches, and the empowerment--recycling our money and getting leverage out of our money. So one of the things we're doing to help that is we've created this platform called Our Faith Empowers, it's an online platform, where members of our churches purchase online, they get a significant discount on whatever they purchase from what they could purchase in the store, and a certain percentage--60 percent of the commission that set aside goes to the local church for its activities. Like at Grace [Grace Baptist Church, Mount Vernon, New York], the money that we're getting from members using it is going to our building fund. Hopefully some will go to scholarships; some churches will go for community programs. But we are, we are in the process--we launched it as of April where members are starting to purchase online. And they get--so it's taking the same money that they would be spending, to keep more for themselves and they're making a contribution to their church. Sixty percent goes to their church, 10 percent goes to their denomination and 10 percent goes to the CNBC. So that we don't create institutions that have to be funded by the same people we're trying to hold accountable. You can't, you can't hold the people--you can't beg from the people and keep them accountable too. So we want our organizations to be financially self sufficient. So we created this network. We have twenty-eight hundred stores that are approachable through this platform. So you can go to any store, you can buy anything. So what we've got to do is change the mindset of our people to get them to buy online, which a lot of young people are already doing. So we're having real success with young adults and that's the future of consumerism, it's going to be online. By 2016, it's going to increase by 61 percent, purchasing online is going to increase by 61 percent. So we've created this vehicle, Our Faith Empowers, the conference of black churches, designed to try and return money. It's transparent, it's owned, created by African Americans. It's not a front for white groups or anything. It's from the ground up, the major sponsor is a company called GlobalHue, which is owned by Don Coleman [HistoryMaker Donald A. Coleman] and the largest African American marketing and advertising company, and Latino. So it's off, it's running, we have staffing for it and I'm really excited about it. I believe it can change those numbers and get the dollar can stay in our community longer. But that's one thing but there are other things that's got to happen. We've got to look at how we start small businesses, how we put businesses in our community and support them. So there's a lot of thinking that's going on around this.
Story_ID: 642122
Speaker 1: Now as a pastor of a high pro- profile church--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you've been involved with certain notable figures in the African American community. One is Heavy D. You preached his services, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, Yes.
Speaker 1: (Unclear). Another one is [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis, the late Ossie Davis. What was his--what was their relationship to the church and are there any other notable people?
Speaker 2: Ossie, Ossie Davis was one of the great inspirations of my life. Ossie Davis was a member of this church when I came here in 1975. At that time he wasn't as active, but he became more active when I came, and he was a great mentor to me, a great counselor. He used to teach at Sunday school here at Grace [Grace Baptist Church, Mount Vernon, New York], before I became pastor he even taught Sunday school. His career got bigger and bigger and he didn't have the time he used to have, but he remained faithful to church, he was very supportive of the church. He was very supportive of me and I have relished in his successes. As a matter of fact in 1976 after I got here, I told him that--I said, "Ossie, I want our church to have a broad appeal, a national appeal." I said, "Do you think you could get us on one of those Christmas specials?" It never crossed his mind that was possible. Strange enough the head of CBS, CBS called him one day and said, "You know we had somebody cancel for Christmas Eve, do you know where we can get somebody to--a church could do Christmas Eve?" So Ossie said, "Well, my church could do it." So he had the CBS people come up here and they talked with me. So 1976, December midnight, we did our Christmas service from here at Grace and two hundred affiliate stations around the world, right here from Grace because of Ossie Davis' influence and his affirming this ministry in 1976. So he was always a positive influence, and I kept a relationship with him for all of his life. You know Earl Graves [HistoryMaker Earl G. Graves, Sr.] is a good member here at Grace, he and Barbara Graves. One of their sons is a member here. He's been a tremendous friend and a large influence. Heavy D was not a member, his fa- his brother, his sister [Portia Myers Davis]--his brother, his sister and their children are all strong members of this congregation, the Myers family. Floyd Myers and his family are strong members, and so when he died they asked me as pastor would I do it and would they come--could they have it here. So we do that, that's our policy today. So it's been a wonderful platform as you say to see people who come. I've had Don King to--regularly attending, Johnnie Cochran, different ones across the years who've been here at Grace. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] preached here, Martin Luther King, Sr. [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] preached during my time here, Benjamin Mays. I mean just the whole spectrum of African American leadership has come in and out of these doors; and it's a high honor to be able to have the privilege to interchange and exchange with them.
Story_ID: 642123
Speaker 1: The church also had a, you had a television show called 'Windows of Grace'--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for a while. Is that still going on?
Speaker 2: No, we decided--I made a real hard decision about that. I decided after being on the air for a couple of years that, first of all I didn't see any real return on investment to the community--to the church. The other thing was that I became very--as I got aware of it, it concerned me, and I'm not racist or prejudice, I try not to be anyway, but I discovered that Jews were--owned the station. They were making all the money off the station and they didn't even believe in the product that we were presenting. I decided that that no longer had an appeal to me. And I thought we could better use our money in other places and it was very expensive. I mean, it was like fourteen thousand a month that I was spending for television. So I got off as did a lot of people. But subsequently, thanks to modern technology, we now have a large following on webcast, we still telecast, but we do it on the computer, on the web. We have people call from Pakistan now and from Soweto [South Africa] and Korea and our members can be away on vacation and they can have a worship experience. We telecast 7:30, 9:30, 11:30 online. So it's evolving and that doesn't cost us anything, I mean other than cameras, the vehicles by which to do it, it's a minimal cost. I think that maybe it costs us four or five hundred dollars to have access to the worldwide web. So it's--that was just a good experience. We used to be on the radio for thirty years and we recently--we won't do that anymore now, we put all our emphasis now on webcast, that's the wave of the future. We believe that online technology, we have online giving, we have a huge website that tells the story of the church today. Thank God that Grace [Grace Baptist Church, Mount Vernon, New York] has been able to be--keep up with the cutting edge of technology, and that has fostered us.
Story_ID: 642124
Speaker 1: You're also like in demand on shows, opinion shows--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --public affairs shows, on the radio and on television.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah we still do that. We still do--I still do television, still do radio, and do interviews. These multiple responsibilities kind of feed each other. You know being chairman of the National Action Network or chairman of the CNBC [Conference of National Black Churches] and chairman of the Virginia Union's Board of Trustees [Virginia Union University Board of Trustees], that's an interesting thing, I didn't close that circle. Here you go, you come to Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia] and you can't read. They come and they take you on, and then forty years later they elect you trustee--chairman of the trustee board to an institution that you couldn't read. They had conditional admission. And today by the grace of God, every degree that goes out of Virginia Union, we just did four hundred last week, has my signature on it. I sign the degrees. That's full circle by the grace of God. You start out can't read and then you get freed and liberated by the institution and now you have the opportunity to go back and serve the institution. For me is one of the greatest things in my career that I have the privilege of being the chairman--former trustee chairman, was there for thirty years and he stepped out, and I was on the board for ten years and they elected me chairman. Where now I'm taking the school to new heights. We're getting ready to break ground for a new building called the Robert Brown building, Robert J. Brown building [Robert J. Brown Living and Learning Center]. He's from High Point, North Carolina and he used to be with the Nixon administration [President Richard Milhous Nixon]. He owns a big company, I'm sure you all have done his history. But he--we're naming the building after him, the living learning center, It's a 240 suite complex with a conference center in the middle of it. And he'll be able to--it's going to be in his honor. We've upgraded the school, the school is going wonderfully. It's, it's really my, my greatest pastime is to see the school be advanced and make it more than what it was when I got there.
Story_ID: 642125
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: I really don't think so. I think what I've done is I've tried to be as faithful as I can every morning, every day. I couldn't have had--and I've never followed a blueprint for my life. I have gotten up every morning, tried to make the most out of every day that I could, and let the blueprint evolve. I've had, I've had some failures of which I've learned from. I've made mistakes and I've learned from them, but in terms of having a blueprint for how to live my life, or how to go forward, I've never had that. Even now as I go tomorrow, I just take what, what I've accumulated and make the best decision. And one thing that happens is, accumulated achievement opens doors for new opportunity. So if you're faithful and do well some one thing, it has a way of building--another thing will happen. And so today I have a lot of demand because a lot of good things that we've been able to achieve have--created other opportunities and now you're in the business of sorting how much can you do and what can you do and try to draw some lines with how far you can go, how far your energy and your focus and your strength can take you.
Story_ID: 642126
Speaker 1: Likewise when you look at everything you've done to this point what today would you considered to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think my legacy will be in, in the church, but viewed through the prism of social justice, economic empowerment and educational excellence. I think all that I have done has come through the prism of the church. I've viewed it that way and I've had access to it on the basis of that. My being a pastor has made access for me to be involved in all the things that I have been involved in. And so that's the legacy, the legacy will be whatever I've done--I've done a lot of things in education, public school education. Now at Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia] I've advocated economic development, built housing and so forth. And then I have been involved in the social justice struggle. Building a--helping to build hopefully a continuing organization, the National Action Network what--that will have impact on social justice.

Speaker 1: Now is there anything I haven't asked you that we need to address before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I don't think so, I think you've been--this has been, it's been insightful for me 'cause it's made me think about stuff I hadn't thought about (laughter) for a long time. Stuff I hadn't even considered like legacy, like impact, like--you sent me back to school to revisit those days and--that I just kind of passed on, moving so fast I haven't been paying attention to.
Speaker 1: Okay, well last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different. Sir how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a person who tried to use all of his resources to advance the human cause, particularly as related to African American oppression and African American failure--well not failure but discrimination. And one who did it through the use of the church as a tool for making a difference. I would like to be remembered as somebody whose faith informed the soc- the cultural context to the extent that the difference was that people got--that people's lives were made better, children, children and adults receive the consequence of my life's activity.
