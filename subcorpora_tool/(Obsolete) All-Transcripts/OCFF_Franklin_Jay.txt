 Finchum  Today is November 15, 2011. My name is Tanya Finchum along with  Juliana Nykolaiszyn. We   re with the Oklahoma State University Library  and we   re doing an oral history project called Centennial Farm  Families. Today we   re in Vinita, Oklahoma, Craig County to speak with  the Franklin family. We have with us Jay Franklin, Judy McBee and  Carol Pixley. Okay. So let   s start with having you explain to us how your  family initially came to have this piece of land.  The Franklins had migrated through Illinois, over to Shawnee Mission,  Kansas. George, who is our great-great grandfather, married Louisa  Pumpkin, a  half  blood Shawnee. That gave him the ability to come  down here on a lease and 1863, if I recall, is when they landed at  Narciss. George had been a wagon freighter and had always camped  right here. There   s a spring in this creek that was his favorite watering  hole. As soon as he could, he moved down here to this site in  1870 .  The first deedings happened with the Dawes Commission. I should have  drug those deeds out, anyway, we still have the original Dawes  Commission deeds for those parcels. They were forty acre tracts, deeded  to George and his three sons. Anyway, we still have all the original  Dawes land and, of course, it   s expanded somewhat from that point.  Was it forty per person, then?  Correct, forty acres.  So it totaled a hundred and sixty, then?  Yes.  And what tribe?  5  Franklin  Finchum  Franklin  Finchum  Franklin  McBee  Shawnee. The Dawes Commission process, they were adopted  Cherokees. The Shawnees were not organized so the Cherokees allowed  them into the role as adopted. In fact, our tribal cards all say Cherokee,  parentheses adopted Shawnee, on it.  Track the lineage from George and how it came to be the three of you.  George to Francis Marion, is that right? May have to defer to Judy  because she remembers these facts better than I do. Francis Marion, let   s  see, let me back up a minute. George had one son that in the 1890s, he  didn   t like dirt farming so he left this side of Vinita and moved about the  same distance to the west side of Vinita. Francis Marion stayed here.  Francis Marion was Fred   s father. Fred   s son was Robert and we   re  Robert   s children.  What was initially farmed here?  It initially started as cattle, but then fairly soon became crop farm   or  diversified, as everything was at that point. I didn   t realize until Judy  just drug up a sheep picture. I never knew there were any sheep on the  place until I saw that one. But hogs, dairy, beef and then virtually every  crop. In that period of time, crop diversity was much greater than it is  now because limited manpower, limited machinery, limited horsepower.  They were farming smaller quantities of each crop to diversify at the  time; barley, oats, flax.  Our dad raised some cotton here, which was kind of unusual and was  kind of a flash in the pan. That was kind of, at least I have the  impression that he snuck the cotton in and our mother never knew about  it, because she was raised in Rush Springs and drug a cotton sack her  whole childhood. I don   t think she saw the cotton until it was up.  During the war he raised flax as well, and I remember him telling the  stories about flax. It handles almost like water. He said the stuff would  almost run up hill if you weren   t careful. When you pull it out of the  field with a wagon or a truck, it   d just splash out like water, it was so  slick. Anyway, but all through the history it   s been generally a mix of  livestock and crops, although currently it   s crops only.  When I was a small child in the early fifties, we had one horse we used  to corral cattle. We usually ran about fifty head of cattle. I remember  Daddy had one field of oats and that was largely keeping the horse going  through the winter. He would have some barley and that would  transition into wheat. Corn, most years, and then later he started growing  the milo, and I   m not sure he even started soy beans before I was grown.  6  Franklin  Finchum  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  Finchum  Do you know what year he started soy beans?  I think soy beans had been around quite a while. He didn   t raise very  many, because there were a lot of issues with southern soybeans in that  period of time. Shatter, difficult harvest and so forth. The corn left in the  mid-   50s when hybridization came along. Grain sorghum became the  preferable crop, because it was more acclimated here. There wasn   t any  corn here until about 2000 and then we got some good southern varieties  and then corn replaced grain sorghum again. Grain sorghum is virtually  gone in this area, corn is back.  What were some of the original structures on the farm?  This leaning barn right behind the house was built in 1872.  Half the length it was and had a shed on the side of it.  Yeah, it was twice as long, I think, initially.  There were three granaries in there.  Yeah, in our time, there was a shed to the west, there was a milking  parlor and then there was a long shed that ran across the north end. I   m  sorry, shed to the east. The long shed that ran to the east was the calf  hutch, and so forth, for dairy. The barn is half as big as it originally was,  and at one time it was probably five times as big as it is now. I never  knew our grandmother, but supposedly she always complained that  every picture that was ever taken of this place had that old barn in it. She  wanted it torn down.  She died in    53.  My mother wanted it torn down, constantly. So Dad would  accommodate her by taking out a piece of it. Within a year of her  passing away, she was asking me when I was going to get that barn out  of there. I waited her out and anyway     That was five years ago. (Laughs)  I keep hoping that I   ll find the time to start gently pulling it back up  straight and trying to preserve it. But anyway for sixty-five years,  seventy years, longer than that, probably eighty years, that barn has been  cussed to be removed.  So your grandparents had a house on this piece?  7  Franklin  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Pixley  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  Pixley  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  Yes, this is the third house, isn   t that right? Fourth. Didn   t two burn and  one move away?  Well, I knew about the one that got burned.  Was that    36?   Nineteen thirty- six?   Nineteen thirty- seven?  If I remember right, one burned before the turn of the century and then  they rebuilt     I don   t know anything about that.  This is either the third or the fourth house. This one was built in 1950.  A little after that, wasn   t it?  I think it     I thought it was after I was born that they started it.  I think that   s probably right. I think it probably started in    51.  One house has moved away and it   s still in use two miles from here. At  least one house, but I think two houses stood there before that burned.  The more recent of the two that he   s talking about, those cedar trees that  are standing there. There used to be four of them in a pattern and you  walked up between the middle of them to the front of the house that  burned. Then they moved in this little house he was talking about that  has been moved again after that. I can remember living in it. I can  remember being awakened in that house to be taken up to the neighbors  the night she (Carol) was born. I can remember once she was born, she  got the baby bed and I slept on the couch right beside the door. I can  remember one winter when it was just awfully, awfully, awfully cold.  Daddy had gone out to do chores and came in and opened that door and  my head was right there by that door, and I can still remember just how  brutal cold it was coming in that door. But it was this little house that  had a little living room, little place to eat, bedroom, kitchen right   beside  it. This one got built after she (Carol) came along and we  needed more space.  Our dad lived here all but six months of his life while the house she   s  8  McBee  Finchum  Franklin  Finchum  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Franklin  Finchum  Pixley  Franklin  talking about was being built prior to this one. Moved five miles away  while that house was being built, but other than that he was born here  and     Used to talk about, in that dining area of that house that   s standing,  that   s about where he was born. The little house that I remember sat over  part of what had been burned before and so when that went away, as a  child, I   d find all sorts of broken china and all sorts of bits of things out  of that burned house that had been covered up those years by the house  we lived in before this one was built.  When did electricity come to the house?  Shortly after the Rural Electrification Act. It got here fairly quickly. The  more interesting story, though, I think, is the telephone line was running  down the highway and Dad run his own telephone line down from the  highway down to this house. This barn, I can remember when it ran off  of a single wire. It grounded back through the ground. There was just a  hotwire coming out here. But anyway, in the late    30s, I   m sure we were  powered. There was, I think I   ve got it all gone now, but there was a lot  of single wire electrification around this place, which is fully functional,  but not very fire safe or shock safe. But delivered power. The hotwire  went and everything else returned through the ground rods, which was  fine as long as the soil was damp and the ground rod was deep.  I was just curious, since you say it was cold, how was that house heated  at the time you were sleeping by the door?  I suppose that coal oil stove was in there?  Was that cast iron stove there?  I   ll bet it was  the coal oil stove  because when we built this house     That was all we had.  That wasn   t new, I don   t think, when it came in, but I can   t remember  where that was in that house.  I don   t even remember that.  No fireplace?  No.  The floor furnaces were     9  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Pixley  Franklin  McBee  Pixley  Franklin  Pixley  Franklin  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  You don   t remember the kerosene stove?  Oh, no     It was, I don   t know, this big square, stood yay tall. You know where the  little stove in the kitchen now vents in, well it vented in from the other  side, sat in that corner. So you just first remembered the floor furnaces?  Yeah, because they were put in either my first or second grade year.  Propane floor  furnace  is the first thing I remember.  Had a small floor, this house, then, in the mid-   50s   small floor furnace  in the living room and one that sat in the back hallway outside the back  bedroom. Then I don   t know when they went central.  Oh,    73 or    4.   Nineteen seventy- six.  Oh, was it    6? I thought it was a little sooner than that because I     It was    76. I was a slow learner. These steel grates on the floor furnaces,  I had a lot of waffle foot from those     Me too. You woke up and the house would be cold so you   d go stand  straddling that thing. (Laughter)  Also, the bottoms of our house shoes were always kind of pretty badly  used.  One year, I got a basketball for Christmas and allowed it to roll on to the  furnace. No more. (Laughter) So I didn   t even have that through the  winter season.  It wasn   t dangerously hot, but it did leave marks on your feet.  You respected it. (Laughs)  This house had an addition built in 1976 out to the front and one of the  REC programs was total electric, so when they did that deal, there was a  rebate for the central heat and air if they would take the propane  furnaces out, and they did. Within two years, they wished they hadn   t  taken the rebate because the electricity was terribly high. The heating  bill in that house was really expensive, still.  10  Finchum  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  Pixley  McBee  Franklin  Finchum  McBee  Finchum  Franklin  Finchum  McBee  Pixley  Franklin  Your grandparents lived here and then your parents lived here. Did they  overlap at that time period?  No. Every generation until me, every generation would move to town  and the next generation would live here. Great-great-grandfather moved  to Vinita, great-grandfather moved to Vinita, grandfather moved to  Vinita, my folks toughed it out and I live in Vinita.  Made you move. (Laughter)  I live in Vinita. So anyway. But yeah, as each   six months is correct.  Four months to build the house, two months our parents lived in a little  cottage.  Oh, I forgot about that. What did they call that? The Honeymoon   ?  Honeymoon Suite     Something like that. (Laughter)  Halfway between here and the highway. A neighbor   s little house is  where they first moved.  Oh, the Ince house, wasn   t it?  Yes.  While our grandparents were getting organized to move to Vinita, they  lived for a couple of months just a quarter-mile up the road.  Did your grandfather have siblings?  No.  Did your father have siblings?  No.  Okay, so just trying to     Grandfather did, grandfather had siblings, yeah.  Daddy didn   t. Daddy was the only child.  Yes, Grandfather. Another Francis, Francis B. was a brother. Actually  11  McBee  Franklin  Mcbee  Finchum  Franklin  Pixley  Franklin  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Franklin  McBee  pulled that picture out of my office.  Luther, Francis, Fred, Bess, Frank, Katie and John.  Yeah. This is grandfather and his brother Frank. Frank farmed on the  opposite side of the highway. They were delivering that team to   that  sold it. Frank was kind of the lead on the horse industry, but they raised  a lot of draft horses and then some light draft horses, as well. But  anyway, that land was on the other side of the highway. Well, part of it  is on this side, as well. Uncle Frank had put together and then our folks  bought part of Uncle Frank   s and then I bought part of Uncle Frank   s.  Actually, our parents bought two different parcels. There was a sixty on  this side of the highway just as soon as you turn off and then they bought  a place on the west side of the section line and I bought the place on the  east side of the section. So we   ve     When our grandfather   s brother was living at that place, they had an  only child, a girl that was pretty much Daddy   s age, so they functionally  were kind of brother and sister.  When there   s siblings, you wonder how the one ended up with the  property and the other didn   t so I was trying to get some clarification.  The other brothers didn   t farm. They all had different careers so they  were just   Fred, our grandfather, and Frank that farmed. Then Frank  peeled off in the    50s. No, earlier than that. Frank kept the place, had a  tenant farmer from the    30s clear through to, what, early    70s when S.B.  retired, probably? I guess.  No, he died during the early    60s, didn   t he?  No, I wouldn   t remember     He was trying to say     When S.B. retired.  Oh, I   m sorry. I thought you were talking about Uncle Frank.  I never knew Uncle Frank. I was just thinking about S.B., an old family  friend, S.B. Wade. His family had grown up just on the south side of  Uncle Frank, on the south end of that section across the road. Samuel  Busey, S.B. Wade, then worked for our Great-Uncle Frank. Actually, do  we want to digress off into the Travelers and Prospect?  I don   t know how far they want to digress. (Laughs)  12  Franklin  Finchum  Franklin  Finchum  McBee  Finchum  Pixley  I   m backing up to talking about where the next generation living here  and the other generation moving off. During Depression times, this  Great-Uncle Frank was working for the Traveler   s Insurance Company.  Traveler   s had a lot of real estate loans, farm loans, out. Anti-trust laws  would not allow a corporation to own any real estate. So Uncle Frank,  our grandfather, we mentioned Ince, Jim Ince, who owned where this  house is that you turned. That   s the only corner we don   t own up there.  He was a cousin. So, Jim Ince, our grandfather, our great-uncle formed  what was called a prospect company, which was backed by Traveler   s,  to hold the real estate holdings that they had to take back during the  Depression. So the three of them, from Oklahoma at least through  Colorado, these three brothers were responsible. They actually held the  title, but they were backed by Travelers.  They were managing all these farms and Travelers was a really  benevolent organization. They did everything they could to keep those  farms in the farmers    hands. Leased it back to them and anyone that was  willing to stay and fight it. A vast majority of that land ended up back in  the original owners    hands again post-Depression. Anyway, so these  three brothers were running this Prospect Company, was the name of it,  that was managing all this land for Travelers. I remember Dad talking  about, they all had brand new Buicks provided by Travelers and they  were pretty impressive during the Depression. (Laughter) They were  wheeling around in brand new Buicks. They carried their clothes and  they carried their saddles with them. They   d just take off when they get  there. They   d saddle up to somebody   s horse and do their inspections  and come back. But a little bit of old western tradition, they didn   t go  anywhere without their own saddle.  That   s how he supplemented the farm at that point, doing this?  Well, no, they were completely independent, away from it. Great-Uncle  Frank, he had a farm operator and then our dad was farming independent  of Granddad. The transition had been made at that point.  Well, as children, what were some of the chores you had, if any?  Oh, yes.  Carol, we can start with you.  Well, because I wasn   t quite as mobile as the others, I probably did more  things inside the house. I did tag along with Judy to feed the chickens  sometimes for the novelty of it. It wasn   t my everyday job. Folded  clothes, washed dishes, dusted     13  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Finchum  Always had a fair sized garden.  Helped with some of the garden things.  Snapping beans and peas.  Shelling Peas.  Shelling peas, I couldn   t find the right word. (Laughs)  Wash jars and cucumbers and okra, just helping prepare things for  canning or freezing.  My least favorite part of all that is when I had to shuck the corn.  Oh, yeah, flies and sticky.  Out in the backyard and, of course, all that stuff gets sticky on your  hands.  No place to wash up very handy. It was just messy.  Once I was in early grades, maybe fourth, third or fourth grade, I was in  4-H and every year, we   d get fifty chicks to be my project and once they   grew up    feed them all up through that time, but even ones they kept,  some of them for laying hens, I still fed the chickens sometimes,  gathered the eggs. Once I was older, for a brief period   do you know  how long it was they had the dairy? Was that all in the    60s?  I don   t know when it was.  I was pretty much in high school, and I don   t know how many years it  was, Daddy had a grade B dairy. Sold milk first to Milnot and then to  Kraft that made cheese.  Non-pipeline.  Yeah, maybe ten or twelve that we   d milk and they were on a concrete  floor. You put the milkers on individually and then dump them. I   d help  with that, some. But it was up to me to go out on the horse and gather up  those cows to bring them in to milk. What else did we have to do? Mow  the yard.  The chickens, did you have to help slaughter them?  14  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Finchum  McBee  Frankin  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Pixley  Frankin  Pixley  McBee  Mama had this system     Reluctantly. (Laughs)  She did the chopping off the heads, but then I often did the plunging  them in hot water to loosen the feathers and pluck them. She would also  be the one that actually butchered them, get all the insides out.  Not her favorite.  No. I plucked chickens, fed chickens, plucked chickens, gathered eggs  and helped, like she said, get things ready to freeze or can.  Was your mother a member of a home demonstration club?  No, she was not. But she did all those things. Most of our clothes,  growing up, were homemade.  Well, yours were.  We   ll get to yours   the girls   ...  Yeah, she sewed a lot for us. I got some     It was very unusual to have   we might get one store-bought dress a  year. But this Uncle Frank that he was talking about, he and his wife,  because of the experience with Travelers, they were living in Dallas by  then and doing pretty well. She would shop at Neiman Marcus, and once  a year, for Christmas, we would get a really fancy dress from Uncle  Frank and Aunt Helen.  I don   t remember any dresses?  Oh, you didn   t get any dresses? (Laughter)  No, I didn   t  But we always had some very nice gift.  Maybe two dresses came and you never got yours. (Laughter)  I was probably too young to remember.  Later on, I remember in high school an interesting purse   it was always  an interesting thing from them. But our other side of the family, our  mother   s mother, in essence, was a nanny for the Mayos that have Mayo  Hotel in Tulsa, so.  15  Pixley  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Frankin  McBee  Franklin  Pixley  Franklin  Pixley  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Jay   s hand-me-downs were good.  Nice. (Laughter)  Peter and Danny Mayo were quite a bit older than me so I was always  well stocked with good clothes.  Much better than we would have had ordinarily. (Laughs) But anyway,  because Mama did sew and have a garden and all that kind of thing,  taught me to sew, we were probably a lot more well-taken care of than  we would have been if it had just been dependent on what the cash could  provide. Because of her doing so much of the labor herself.  She was an avid gardener. At the risk of this being taped, I   m going to  express an opinion here. (Laughter) Home demonstration clubs, and I   m  very, very pro Extension, been extremely involved in Extension my  whole career. So I don   t mean to belittle that in any way...  I   ll say it. She didn   t need home demonstration clubs. (Laughs)  Well, no it wasn   t so much that, she wasn   t competitive.  I don   t remember her ever taking anything to the fair.  Her era of home demonstration participants were actually the teachers.  But their motivation to be involved was competitiveness and she just  wasn   t competitive. The next generation or the younger portion of that  generation   they were still, there was a lot of training that took place. A  lot of it was actually not so much from Extension as from the group  itself. She just wasn   t competitive and wasn   t a participant in it. But  absolutely loved to garden. I hated it, but she     Or at least she felt it necessary.  No, she truly loved to garden. She really did. I can remember backing an  eight-bottom plow in to plow her garden for her. Plowing, the tractor  was     Half the size of the garden. (Laughs)  She had a big garden, but it took up as much garden space to turn around  and take another swath as it did to get into it, but anyway, she truly did  love to garden.  She   d do a lot of extra. We   d have green beans for the whole year that  we canned. By having fifty chickens, we   d have a chicken for every  16  Pixley  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Finchum  McBee  Pixley  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  week and then we   d save some back as laying hens for the next year.  We   d butcher a beef every year, usually.  But she would do things like pickled beets. We had a little peach tree  that had small white  cling  peaches that were hard to manage any other  way, but she   d make pickled peaches that were wonderful.  And lots of pickles, cucumber pickles. Every kind of way     She   d try anything. I remember one year she decided to make     Lots of kraut, relish     Well, she didn   t make a lot of kraut because it turned out that the  cabbage grown here was hot enough that the kraut wasn   t really that  good. You needed sweeter cabbage to start with so that didn   t become a  big deal. But she would try anything.  Did you have a cellar, or   ?  Yes, oh, yes. That   s where all the canned goods went. And where we  went in the storms.  Yeah. (Laughter)  I had a cousin that lived in Tulsa that was my age, within a few months,  and we were terrors.  They were competitive.  We were terrors. We weren   t competitive, we were   the only reason we  were competitive was trying to think of a new idea that both of us could  try. Anyway, a big old     Tall vent pipe.  Tall vent pipe in the cellar, ventilation port. We always enjoyed our  firecrackers on the Fourth of July. One year, we got to experimenting  with dropping those firecrackers down the pipe because the cellar would  make a wonderful booming noise when one went off in there. Anyway,  so we got to experimenting. They didn   t sound near as good when they  hit the floor. So we   d let them burn down to where they   re about that  long, drop them in there so they   d explode in the air, you know. What  we didn   t realize, we were blowing up pickles left and right on the shelf  right behind that vent pipe. He went home and I cleaned up pickles and  17  Pixley  Franklin  Pixley  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Finchum  McBee  Franklin  McBee  glass for a long time. My choring was I was baby calf feeder, and beef  feed bucket toter, and went to the field at a pretty early age.  Judy did, too.  Yeah, yeah.  Were you about twelve when you started plowing and stuff?  Judy was an excellent plow hand.  Well, it all depends on your parameters. See, I tried to make everything  come out nice and neat at the end and just as far out as you could. No  telling how many fence posts I took out because I went too far before I  quit. (Laughter)  Dad had a young hired hand one summer, and he was too lazy to clean  out his own plow when it balled up, he   d make Judy clean out the plow  for him.  That   s not quite the way it worked.  I saw you cleaning out Freddy   s plow several times.  I helped. I really did enjoy doing anything with Daddy, though. The year  I finished high school, Daddy happened to be between hands, and I just  asked him whether he thought I   d be up to the task of working for him  that summer instead of him hiring a high school kid. So one summer, I  was his hand and didn   t do all the things with Mama in the house and the  garden.  Did he actually pay you?  Well, it went towards college. I don   t remember money changing hands.  (Laughter) But I did plow. He never trusted me to do very much  cultivating. I did a little bit of cultivating of corn. But he definitely  wouldn   t turn me loose with the sprayer. He didn   t want me exposed to  that. Jay eats, drinks, and breathes fumes from all the chemicals in the  world. (Laughter)  I actually started on the cultivator.  Drove wheat truck, helped him some baling hay. Usually I was driving  the truck, but I never will forget, one time pushing the hay off for him  from the barn and he wasn   t going to tell me he baled up a copperhead.  The first I found was my hand right down the side of it.  18  Franklin  Pixley  Franklin  Pixley  Franklin  Pixley  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Finchum  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  Oh, oh, we   ve got to talk about hauling hay. (Laughter) I didn   t have a  driver hauling hay one summer. Let me back up. Carol Sue was a  preemie. Too much oxygen got her retinas. Mumps or measles at three  finished off your vision?  Measles.  But I was short a truck driver so   large truck with a belt loader. So I  tied binder twine on her left and right elbows, ran it out the truck  window and tied it up on the loader and just drove her like a horse. Pull  on the left binder twine and she   d veer off left, pull on her right elbow  and she   d veer off to the right, pull on both of them when we   re loaded.  I thought I was driving. (Laughter)  It all worked famously until   she   s awful good with math, but she  forgot one bale and forgot where she left it. She was dragging off the  truck and I was in the barn. She forgot where she left one bale and the  truck was pitched up and a good five or six feet off the ground. She  tripped off that one bale and rolled off the back of the truck and hit the  ground. Lost another driver.  I dived off the bale. It kind of started tipping and I went off head first.  (Laughter) It could have been pretty terrible.  Well, where were you when you were     I was stuck in the truck catching the hay coming up in the loader. I was  in the back of the truck.  See, I was long gone by then, so.  Did your father know you were doing this?  I think we told him after it was over. (Laughter)  Jay was always inventive on figuring out how to get something done. I   ll  let you tell the story once I start it. Daddy had this little Simplicity  garden tractor and Jay decided to modify it for his personal use     I built the first three-wheel all terrain vehicle known to man. (Laughter)  You   ve got to describe what this thing looked like to start with.  Walk behind garden tractor, little small wench and little tractor tires and  19  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Pixley  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  handlebars with that cultivator attachment or mower attachment. It had  seen its last day so Dad gave it to me. I brought it in here, and I took the  handlebars off, reversed the axle, reversed the motor. I took my twenty-six  inch bicycle, took the back wheel off it, attached it where the  handlebars went and built a three-wheeler out of it. Worked awful good  until I decided it needed to go faster and faster and I took the governor  off of it and I   d been two miles south up here on it   neighbor   s house  and was coming home. Went across the highway. I had, like I said,  removed the governor. Got around a little bit fast with my baling wire  throttle and blew a rod out of it and it imbedded in the back of my right  calf when I came across the highway. So I had a chunk of steel in my leg  about that long. Piece of rod. But I pushed it home and hid it and dug the  steel out and never did tell anybody, because I didn   t want Dad to know  I   d blown up that motor.  Toughness kind of runs there. I was telling Jay lately about something  that he didn   t even know about. I can remember one time being in the  house and Daddy coming in because he had been cutting wood with an  axe and had hit the end of his boot and gone through enough that it had  gone through the nail, but he didn   t want Mama to know. We hid a lot of  things from one another. (Laughter) Didn   t want Mama to know that  he   d done this.  Mama was pretty apt to worry.  Came in and just,    Shh, don   t tell Mama.    (Laughter) He didn   t even  know how bad it was. So he comes in and takes off his shoe to see  what   s going on, but he never let on. I doubt he ever told Mama what  he   d done.  See, I haven   t heard some of these stories, because I was away at school  so much of the time I missed it. (Laughs)  When our dad was a young adult, he got kicked by a draft horse. It was  his right leg if I remember right, broke the knee. He was extremely  bowlegged. No it was his left leg.  Don   t ask me, I don   t know.  It was his left leg. Anyway, broke the bone, terribly bowlegged and then  much later in life, a dairy cow kicked him in the same leg. Broke it  again. So that leg was bent the other direction very bad. One day he  dropped a spike harrow on his foot and it missed every bone in his foot,  but it went between his big toe and his second toe. Went right through  the meat of his foot and out, through the bottom of his boot. He was  pinned to the ground in the field so he just jerked the harrow up and  20  McBee  Franklin  Finchum  McBee  Finchum  McBee  Franklin  Pixley  Franklin  Finchum  McBee  Finchum  McBee  came home.  I didn   t even know about that one.  Cleaned it up and that big toe, it raked the tendon and pulled that toe  back. So for years, his big toe was pulled back terribly bad until the  early    80s, he was unloading a bale spear out of his pickup and it got  away from him, probably because his left knee was so weak. He  stumbled and this two hundred pound device landed on that same toe  and straightened it right back out. (Laughter) I don   t know how many  times   our dad was an absolute eternal optimist. He never had a bad  day.  And he doctored himself, I take it.  (Laughs) It wasn   t like we were anti-medicine or anything. Anything  that you really need a doctor   s attention, we   d be there. I remember we  were the first ones in line when the polio vaccine came out. It   s not that  we didn   t believe in medicine, it   s that if it wasn   t convenient, you just  kept going.  Didn   t worry about tetanus shots?  We had tetanus shots, yeah.  Yeah, a lot of them.  Somebody needed an extra few. (Laughter)  I had one every year. What I was trying to say a minute ago is that one  of his favorite expressions is,    If you   re farming, you   ve had a good day  if you get home with ten fingers.     There   s a lot of farming accidents.  Jay   s had some close friends that have had some bad ones. So that   s  close to home.  When you were working for him that summer, how early would he have  you up and out?  I have no idea. He was the real early riser. It drove my mother crazy.  (Laughter) She   d be sleeping good and he   d just wake up spontaneously.  He might set an alarm and he might hear the little click before it actually  went off, but mostly he was long gone before it was time for it to go off.  But in the summertime, he would work way before dawn. She swore  21  Pixley  Franklin  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Pixley  Franklin  he   d come right under her window to do it.  You know we had our windows open because we didn   t have air  conditioners in bedrooms.  Banging on something.  I don   t remember getting up extraordinarily early and often times, we   d  be working after dark. I can remember more than once Mama taking  supper to the field in the dark.  Mama used to help with the wheat hauling, too. When we were little,  sometimes she   d set us up with a quilt or a blanket out on the edge  somewhere where we could play while she loaded up or maybe she   d go  for blackberries in between rounds or something.  There   s a place up across the creek and around that had a really good  blackberry patch and there was one little stand up there, I think it had a  lot of persimmon trees, but anyway. That was a favorite place. That   s  still one of my most fond memories, going up there with a quilt and us  being up there.  Oh, yeah, sometimes we   d have a picnic for lunch. I remember a time or  two. Sometimes we   d get to ride in the   this was back when we didn   t  have seatbelts yet. Nobody worried about kids in the back of the truck.  We   d ride in the wheat all the way to the grain elevator. I lost my shoe  one time. (Laughter) Until it dumped.  One time Mama had gone to town with a fairly old pickup, that I   m not  sure what she was hauling back. Do you remember what it was, when  she got stopped by the patrolman?  It was a two-ton wheat truck, coming home from Afton.  Oh, I thought she was in that old gray Ford pickup. I didn   t know she  ever drove the big truck.  Oh, yeah.  She was coming back from Afton and this wasn   t the most delightful  looking old truck, but Dad had gone to a lot of effort to get all the lights  working right and everything was fine. Anyway, she was coming back  from the elevator and turned off the highway to come this direction. The  patrolman had been following her from Ten-Mile Corner up here two  miles away and turned off and followed her down the section line and  stopped her. Walked up and said,    You know I   ve been following you  22  McBee  Finchum  Pixley  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  for two miles, because I just knew that when you turned off you  wouldn   t be able to signal, so I just wanted to tell you how impressed I  was that all the lights were working on your truck.     That is not the story I was thinking of. I didn   t even know about that.  This is when she was coming back from Vinita, and I   m sure it was in  that old gray Ford pickup. I think she must have had it loaded with seed  or fertilizer or something. Anyway, it was way overloaded for the  springs on it, and so it was kind of swaying. She got stopped because it  wasn   t behaving according to laws.  I take it she didn   t have a job off the farm either, then?  For a short period of time she did.  She really enjoyed that. She was a dedicated farm wife, but she really  enjoyed working in an office. She had started out in college in Edmond  and the war came along. She came up here, lived in Vinita, commuted  down to Pryor to the ammunitions plant to work in an office down there.  She really, really enjoyed doing that kind of thing. When I was in high  school, for a period of time she worked at what was then the  Munsingwear plant. It   s the same building that now has   is it Cinch or  is somebody different in there now?  Cinch.  But she was the secretary to the     They made hosiery back then, and now they make Boeing wiring  harnesses, but same building.  She very much enjoyed that. Really, at the point that she was retirement  age, she worked part-time as the church secretary at our church. Was  really, really sad to have to give that up after she had a stroke. She loved  that kind of thing.  Talking about going to the field early   forty-five acre field that, Dad  never did tell me, but I finally figured it out just a few years ago, or at  least I think I did. He must have lost a stand because his field dried out  on him. He was certainly a morning person to be gone quick, but we  weren   t expected to be functional till seven or eight. But this one field  from the time I was nine until I got out of college and he quit dirt  farming and I started, we would be in that field at two o   clock every year  so that it was done in the same day. It was the only one, he would get me  up and off we would go. I finally figured out that he must have lost a  stand in that field one time. It wasn   t going to happen again, so we  23  McBee  Franklin  Pixley  McBee  Pixley  McBee  would start at two so by dark, that same day it would be worked and  planted. Of course, now, that would be a two hour job, but it used to take  a while.  I don   t know what made me think about this, but up past where we were  talking where the blackberries were, thinking about this property that  fascinated me. Going up through the pasture there, there was one  particularly big buffalo wallow over there. There were some other  smaller ones up there   just the kind of history with what the land had  been always interested me. I can remember, I lived in Alaska twenty  years and came back in 2000. It was after I came back that Daddy and I  took a drive up to the section line here and a mile east. He started  showing me where in the old days the wagons had come across from the  south and headed up, I don   t know where they were going, up eventually  to maybe Kansas City, I don   t know. But a major thoroughfare up  through there. You could still see where, he   d have to show me, but I  could still see where the terrain was different because of where it had  been worn out by all those wagons going through year after year after  year. There was a period of time when there was kind of a thoroughfare  from, I don   t know, Ketchum to I don   t know where, going this way, but  people would come by right by this spring between here and where that  house sits, right on north.  She mentioned those cedar trees. George, great-great-grandfather,  planted four cedar trees, because there wasn   t a tree on this place   there  wasn   t a tree from here to Vinita. My dad could remember when there  were no trees other than those cedar trees from here to Vinita. Of course,  he did see the bulk of the history of this place since it   d been inhabited.  But he   s the one that saw everything from farming with horses to  farming with GPS. I remember in 1976, he bought his first tractor with a  cab and air conditioning and he said,    Boy, don   t let anybody kid you  about the good old days. There wasn   t anything good at all about  following a horse all day long. I like this cab.    (Laughter)  Didn   t you find quite a few arrowheads when we were little?  Yeah. Yeah.  There were still interesting artifacts around.  Going back to the good old days, I can remember our folks were really  good about pointing out something that might have real significance.  This one thing was making a point of getting us up there to actually  watch the threshing machine work on the next section over, because they  were almost extinct. Everything was going to combines at that point.  That   s something that   s stuck in my mind that I wouldn   t have had any  24  Pixley  Franklin  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Pixley  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Finchum  McBee  Franklin  McBee  knowledge of if they hadn   t made a point to say,    You need to see what  this is doing.    I think back to when I was really young. My mother sat  me down in front of the TV to watch Queen Elizabeth   s coronation  because this is a significant thing in history.  I vaguely remember that. Just very, very vaguely, because I was still  pretty little.  Our mother was very history oriented, very politically oriented. Had a  good sense of current events that were going to be significant.  Gavel-to-gavel conventions, when it mattered.  Yeah, back when.  When you didn   t know who was going to be the nominee until that last  vote. (Laughter)  Yeah, so we developed our interest in politics from that experience.  We were raised staunch Republicans in a Democratic world up here.  Our mother was always our   our precinct was down at the little school  that I went to for five years. They never had that experience, but  anyway, she was always the Republican observer or whatever you     Judge.  Thank you. He   s the more political     Was registrar several   how many years did she do that?  I don   t know. She worked in the 1960 decennial census. That was more  out of civic responsibility than monetary need, I think.  Around the dinner table, would politics be the discussion or would it be  something else?  Not that much.  No, no, we   d get called in later for that. Judy is nine years older than I  am. She was an avid Campfire Girl. I got drug all over this place eating  burnt bread and crud.  Now, Jay, that was fun  (Laughter)  25  Pixley  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Not to him. We turned him off of camping forevermore.  (Laughter) I enjoyed it.  This cousin that I was talking about before, his dad was Mom   s brother,  just younger than her. We did a lot of things we should have patented.  (Laughter) ATVs, we had a zip line when we were kids.  How tall was that ladder we used to get up to that limb?  It was probably twenty-five feet.  Oh, was it that high? Are you sure?  Yeah, I remember the ladder.  Two 2x4s with 1x4 rungs across it.  Homemade ladder.  Leaned up against this big old limb, I mean solid limb out there, that was  one end. The other end of the line was across the creek and, I guess, tied  to another tree.  Yeah, big elm down there.  Just your old homemade board swing thing, climb up on the limb, get  your feet in there and off you   d go. But Uncle Ed, he was just a little too  attached to the tree one pass. (Laughter) Took a rip out of his pants  about as big as that. (Gestures about ten inches by ten inches)  Left his pants on one side of the creek and ended up on the other end.  (Laughter) Our two   Dad was an only child, so our two uncles were  absolute wild hares.  They   d survived World War II in the navy.  They were both navy guys and just nuts.  So much fun. (Laughs)  Ed, the oldest one, came home to drive an ambulance when driving an  ambulance mattered, you know. It was all about speed, which suited him  just fine.  He was also a pilot, and he has landed a plane in this field across the  26  Franklin  McBee  Pixley  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  Finchum  McBee  Finchum  Mcbee  road down here.  He   s landed everywhere in his plane.  I saw that. When I was in college he took me from, I don   t even know  where he picked me up. We went to Wichita for some reason.  He took me back to Muskogee at least once, if not more, just because he  could.  He brought his plane in. We   ve got a piece of native meadow that is long  and is a hay meadow. His favorite place to land was in this hundred acre  field right across the road, but it was in soybeans at the time, so he went  over and landed in the meadow. This was right before the meadow was  cut for hay and nearly flipped his plane when he landed in there. Then he  couldn   t get out. He had to go back and forth five or six times smashing  down all Dad   s hay so he could get the plane back out. (Laughter) But  Dad didn   t mind that kind of stuff. I remember Mom talking about   he  was an avid hunter.  Both of them.  All three of them. Mom used to talk about somebody would come along  wanting to go quail hunting, and Dad would just leave the tractor in the  field and leave.  We could always count on having quail in the fall. I remember going  hunting with him one time and I was ok with a .22, but he wanted to see  if I wanted to try and get some birds with a shotgun. I shot once or  twice, and then I gave it back and said,    I   d rather have the quail.     (Laughter)  She   s more than okay with a .22. Only person I ever knew that could  shoot a frog without it jumping in the water. Normally a frog faces the  water, you shoot it, it hops back in. But she figured out where to hit him,  right behind the head, to where he   d just drop. She was our frog leg  provider.  Modern day frog gigging?  Yeah.  You mentioned that you went to a school that they didn   t get to?  One-room school. Daddy went to Success.  27  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  Pixley  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Finchum  McBee  Finchum  Franklin  Finchum  McBee  Franklin  I actually found a picture.  You   ve got the picture?  I   ve got a picture of Dad at Success. The Success marching band. They  all apparently had oat can drums there, it looks like.  Oatmeal boxes?  Yeah. It had been a separate different location a half mile away,  originally. Did Daddy go to where we knew it? Where I went to school?  Was it there when he went?  Yeah. Yeah.  I went through the fifth grade there and then our enrollment dropped  enough that we were consolidated with Vinita. I think we had to have  fifteen that last year and we had thirteen. So I went sixth grade through  high school at Vinita.  And how far from here to   ?  Two and a half miles, more or less.  How would he get there, your father?  Horseback.  Horse. And then how would you?  They usually took me. I wasn   t quite old enough that they wanted to turn  me loose with a horse to cross the highway. One of our neighbors did  ride her horse quite a bit.  Not only farming, but Dad saw a lot of change in this country. Grand  Lake is just four miles east of here. When he was growing up, the water  resort was Spavinaw Creek and we never went to the lake other than  some occasion when somebody else would have an event there, we   d go  to Spavinaw because that   s where he went. But anyhow. He went to high  school in Cleora, which is in the middle of the lake. Cleora now is  moved a mile from where it was originally. He graduated from   here   s  his graduation picture from Cleora in    34.  One of the most interesting stories is him telling about the sailboat  bridge being built. There wasn   t water anywhere around, they were just  building this monstrous tall bridge out in the middle of a prairie. He said  28  Finchum  Pixley  Franklin  Pixley  Franklin  Finchum  Pixley  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Finchum  McBee  Franklin  McBee  the workers were jumping back and forth from across the creek as they  were building the thing. I don   t know how tall it is, but it literally is built  to take a sailboat under. It was just sitting out in the middle of the prairie  over there. They built it while they were building the dam because  Grove was going to be cut off. It was four or five years before the lake  filled up and there was any water underneath this bridge after they built  it out there sitting in the middle of nowhere. Saw a lot of change in this  country.  And in farming, both the land and the   So you would have gone to  Vinita for high school, Carol? No, Carol would have gone     I went to the Oklahoma School for the Blind in Muskogee. Started when  I was five. Lived in the dorm and came home for the weekends.  I went to Muskogee every Sunday, too.  Yes. (Laughs) To take me back to school.  They were very dedicated. The Arkansas River was out one time and  Dad decided Carol Sue needed to go home so he took the grain truck  down there because it could cross the river to get her back.  So education was important to both parents?  I couldn   t wait to start school because somehow I got to visit Success  one day with you for part of a day, and I couldn   t wait until I could go to  school. I actually ended up starting a year early because they decided,  the school administration decided, I was ready to go ahead and go. So  we had to come hustle, getting things ready.  Mom got some hours at OCU, I guess? Is that right?  No.  UCO. Yeah.  Yeah.  Which was Central State at that time.  Central State College, I guess, at that time.  Dad went to John Brown, momentarily.  Oh, I didn   t even know that.  29  Pixley  Franklin  Pixley  McBee  Franklin  Mcbee  Franklin  Pixley  Franklin  Finchum  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  Mcbee  Pixley  McBee  Franklin  I didn   t realize that he actually attended. I thought he was just planning  on it.  I think he got a semester in down there.  I did not know that.  I didn   t either.  Yeah. And then the war kind of changed everything.  Well, he was deferred because he was a farmer.  Yeah. He tried to enlist, but they had to farm. Anyway, so Judy   s got  some OSU hours and some OU hours and Carol Sue   s got a B.S. from  OBU and an M.S. and a     You said that wrong, but they don   t care about all the details of that.  (Laughter)  From KU.  From KU? What about you?  I   m an O-Stater. Ag-econ.  Yeah, I only changed because at that time, I changed my major and OSU  didn   t have a nursing program yet at that point. The next year after I   d  gone to OU, I came back and  went to an  OSU game, sitting on the  visitor   s side, and I was doing pretty good being polite until OSU made  one particularly good play. (Laughter) We   re all avid OSU fans now  because Jay   s son played there.  We had a cousin that played in the    60s     At OU.  Well, at OSU and then OU.  Both.  We had a cousin that played at OU in the    50s and another one that  played at OSU in the    60s. My son graduated two years ago. My family  did reasonably well. Noah has two bachelors from OSU, I have a  bachelor   s from OSU, my wife has a bachelor   s from OSU, my daughter  30  Finchum  Pixley  Franklin  Pixley  Finchum  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  has a bachelor   s and a master   s from OSU and then my other daughter  has a degree from OU. Anyway.  That   s a pretty good track record.  We still love her.  Yeah, because she   s got the grandsons. (Laughter)  That   s right.  What were some holidays like back in the day?  Oh, holidays. We haven   t even talked about Uncle Ed and the cousin  that he corralled. There   s an older brother   is Tommy closer to your  age?  Yes, just a year ahead of me in school  So a couple years younger than me. We and our grandmother were   together for  the holidays. Christmas was in Tulsa. Everything else was  here on the farm. We had fireworks every Fourth of July, always got to  have fresh tomatoes and corn-on-the-cob out of the     And usually watermelon. Maybe not home grown. Homemade ice  cream.  Thanksgiving (until everybody got too decrepit) going out hunting early  in the day. Big Thanksgiving dinner, here.  And then go tour the farm, as Aunt Bernice referred to it   all pile in the  truck. (Laughter)  Well, pickup. I sat on the tailgate one time and went over a terrace and  my feet caught and here I am standing on the terrace. (Laughter) Pickup  goes right on by. But we would go around and see the whole farm for  Aunt Bernice   s sake and over there at that place where I fell out of the  truck was the pear orchard that   okay who planted the pears?  Francis.  Which would be approximately how long ago, now?  Roughly turn of the century. He got a special on pear trees. Two-hundred  pear trees.  31  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Finchum  Pixley  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  Pixley  McBee  Pixley  McBee  See, we should have planned for that. There might still be some pears on  those trees.  No, they frosted out     Oh, did they?  Some of these trees would be all hollowed out, just sort of a little hole  on one side. They   d still put out some pears.  They   re kind of gnarly, but    (laughter)  Wonderful  Mama would make pear honey.  And pear preserves. Canned some, too, I think sometimes.  Yeah.  What was your favorite dish that she made, if you had one?  Oh, goodness.  Couldn   t possibly have one favorite.  Oh, yeah you can.  What is it?  Oyster casserole.  No, no, no, no. That was good, but not that    I was always impressed  when she made cinnamon rolls. That was rare, but very, very special.  Once I went to the Vinita schools, early on, I was catching the bus up at  the highway. Later on it came by here, but I had that half mile plus, most  of the time walked it. Walking back home, I could get nearly to the  creek sometimes and begin to smell fresh bread. Lots of times when  she   d make bread, she   d make cinnamon rolls. That was just wonderful  to come home to. Warm bread.  She made more of that when we had our own milk, and I don   t know  why because you don   t necessarily put a lot of milk in bread dough.  Hardly any.  32  Pixley  McBee  Franklin  Pixley  McBee  Finchum  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Pixley  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Pixley  Franklin  McBee  Pixley  It seemed like it was during that time     Must have been contemporaneous and not necessarily as a consequence  of. (Laughter) Talking about how you look at things and do things, when  we did have our own milk, she was concerned about the fact that she  didn   t want to be drinking raw milk. So she got this great big  pasteurizer. What did that thing hold? Three gallons?  I don   t know. It was a good size.  It had a timer on it, didn   t it?  Yeah, and its own heat plate thing to keep it the right temperature so she  could pasteurize the milk. Anyway, when we had our own milk, we   d  churn butter.  Cottage cheese?  She did that on occasion, but that didn   t turn out real good.  Yeah, that didn   t turn out real good, so that didn   t last either. (Laughter)  She couldn   t interest us in that very much.  It had a different, odd flavor.  It didn   t taste right. The texture wasn   t good. It was just, blah.  I just forgot my absolute all time favorite dish.  Oh, no. What?  Peanut butter sandwiches.  Oh, Jay  We don   t have to tell how she made peanut butter sandwiches,  do we? (Laughter)  We have a difference of opinion here.  I never knew that a peanut butter sandwich involved jelly until I saw it  on television one time. I guess this was a Depression holdover deal.  It had to be.  They really won   t believe it. (Laughs)  33  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  Finchum  Franklin  Pixley  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Pixley  Finchum  Franklin  Pixley  Franklin  Pixley  McBee  Finchum  Franklin  But it   s good.  No it isn   t. My tongue curls even before you speak the words.  Peanut butter, Miracle Whip and lettuce. It is wonderful. Wonderful.  Miracle Whip, not mayonnaise?  Not mayonnaise. Miracle Whip.  We hardly ever used mayonnaise.  No, Mom was   she was     Anti-mayonnaise.  Anti-mayonnaise, yeah. When I got married, I thought I had arrived  when I got mayonnaise.  (Laughter) I still don   t like mayonnaise.  I like Miracle Whip. I still use it.  Peanut butter, lettuce and Miracle Whip.  Miracle Whip.  The peanut butter went down a lot easier. It didn   t stick to your mouth.  Real good. (Laughter)  Judy and I don   t fix ours that way anymore.  Definitely don   t.  You mentioned terraces a while ago. So he was involved with the soil  conservation back in the day?  Yeah, yeah. Dad was school board at Success and then school board at  Vinita High School. He wasn   t on the conservation district board, but he  was on the ASCS  Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service   board and the FHA  Farmers Home Administration  board and the  FMHA  Farmers Home Administration  board before they were all  consolidated. Actually, conservation district is my deal. I just got my  fifteen year pin because I put in fourteen years that ended fourteen years  ago and then went back on the board last year, so anyway. For twenty-  34  Finchum  Franklin  Finchum  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  nine years, all the time I was off the board, I was an associate. Yeah,  we   conservation district has been a pretty important deal.  How many ponds on the property?  One, two, three, four, five   five.  Man-made, most?  Yeah.  When did you start no-till, Jay?  Nineteen eighty-four.  Pioneered in this area on that, didn   t you?  Yeah, I   ve got the oldest continuous no-till field in Oklahoma. Extension  comes up and plays with it on occasion.  Because he was not going to get up at two o   clock to farm that, to do  that farm to conserve moisture. Field, I mean. (Laughs)  And then I built flow ponds. I did a lot of custom dozer work for fifteen  years, probably. Yeah, at least fifteen.  The no-till question is probably worth talking about a little more because  of the time that went through and how so many people were failing   a  difference that that made in your whole approach to the farm     Oh, okay.  I mean, you were talking history, here. It really is significant.  Okay, I got out of school in    78. Had enough CLEP hours that I could  skip a semester so I stayed home the fall of    77 and actually put my first  crops out in    77, farming in earnest in    78. Dad was 39 years older than  me. He wanted to quit crop farming and continue to run cattle. We were  never actually in business together, at all. I rented his crop land and  other crop land. By 1980, I was farming way too much ground. Didn   t  have any equity, didn   t have a partner. That was a curious time. Inflation  was so rampant then that   make fun of bankers, since I am one, now.  Bankers didn   t worry about equity, because you   d have some tomorrow  because inflation was so rampant. So I had a tremendous amount of  money borrowed and was way over-extended and didn   t know it,  because I was a young college graduate and too    smart    to know that I  35  McBee  Franklin  Finchum  Franklin  was in trouble.  Then the    80s, extremely high interest rates, drought, everything else. By  the early to mid-   80s, I was in trouble. My machinery was wearing out. I  needed to replace it and really couldn   t afford it. Even though I was  conservation advocate that was not the driving force. It was economics.  Going back to picking on Extension, again. Oklahoma State was one of  the absolute pioneers of no-till in the nation. They had some guys that  were real advocates and they got the cart before the horse. There was no  equipment, there was no herbicide. The concept failed, and no-till in  Oklahoma was just absolutely a dirty word because a lot of people tried  and technology just wasn   t there.  The rest of the country was starting to catch up by the early, mid-   80s  and the tools and herbicide   Round-Up was introduced. Round-Up was  ridiculously expensive, but it worked. So I really was down on the pins  and if I was going to continue to farm, I was going to have to do it with  much, much less capital. Anyway, told Dad what I was considering. This  field I was talking about that we would get up and work in the middle of  the night, it was so tired and sandy. He was thinking about putting in  Bermuda. He said,    Well, give that place a try and see what happens.     That is the oldest no-till field in Oklahoma. Anyway, he was very  supportive of the whole process, and I just made lock, stock and barrel  conversion. Sold the large four-wheel drive tractor or traded it in on a  no-till drill and off we went.  Like I say, for me it was an economic driver. A lot of other people tried  it around the neighborhood, and they thought maybe I knew what I was  doing. They soon figured out I didn   t and they quit, went back to some  kind of conventional system. But it   s worked well. The only secret to it  is you just have to suffer through a few years until the soil responds to  the process and then it works. Anyway. I don   t want to leave the  impression that it was some magnanimous, tree-hugging motivation.  (Laughs) We   re not tree-huggers.  I was broke and that was the only way I was going to survive. It saved  me and I like it. It freed up a lot of time you   d be in the field so I started  doing a lot of custom dozing. Which was a good thing because it would  keep me busy when I   d be tempted to go work ground.  Moving dirt one way or the other, huh?  Yeah. Yeah. You know, in your notes, there   s something in there about  the smell of dirt and there is something to that. I will tell you, in this  country, hogging out top soil that hadn   t been disturbed by the dozer  36  Pixley  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Finchum  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Franklin  Pixley  McBee  Franklin  Finchum  McBee  smells a lot better than the old tired farm land does. It smells pretty  good.  I love the smell of the garden dirt in the spring and the taste of the first  radishes.  (Laughs) Dirt.  They were washed, but they still kind of   they smelled more like dirt  than the ones you get in the grocery store.  Oh, yeah, in the grocery store there   s no flavor in anything.  Well, since the two of you don   t live on a farm, is there something in  particular that you miss most?  I miss roaming the property. When I think back to what my parents let  me do, I can   t believe they did. I   d be gone for hours out in these woods.  They wouldn   t have had a clue where in the world I was. I guess that  wanderlust started early. Back before this house was built (so that has to  mean I couldn   t have been more than four years old). I climbed a  chicken wire fence, and my mother saw me disappearing across the  creek going up into the woods. (Laughter)  How old were you?  I couldn   t have been more than four, because we were still living in that  little house.  Being here and them further away, I had more of an opportunity to  debrief our parents late in their lives. In their defense, she was a wild  child. They could not confine her. They did their best to keep her  contained     She   d run away in stores before kids did that sort of thing. (Laughter)  I understand that.  She   d just roam like a dog.  But you found your way home.  One time though, I   ll tell you what, things got interesting sometimes. I  was on the horse one time in there nearly to the next  fence line    been  nearly a half mile up in there. It was nearly to the field on the other side  when you get to the other side of the road. Started back down fairly  37  Pixley  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Finchum  McBee  Franklin  close to the creek, but I couldn   t see the creek. Started into this thicket of  trees. I don   t think any of them were anymore around than two or three  inches. The further I got in there, the denser it got. It finally got to the  point that there wasn   t room for me and the horse and there wasn   t room  to turn the horse around. So I had to get off the horse, lead the horse  through so we could get out to something clearer again. It was kind of  wild up in there. Yeah, I still enjoy running around everywhere.  We lived in Alaska. I loved to backpack up in the mountains and  through the woods. Just tromping the territory. You   re exactly right  about different dispositions. Everybody now thinks you   ve got to be  politically correct. You don   t paddle your kids. If my parents had not  taken physical restraint with me, I don   t know what they could have  done other than lock me up in a room. I hated having to be told to go out  and get your own switch and bring it back in and we use it.  That   s just too humiliating  (Laughter)  Jay was so much more sensitive, and he has been able to raise his  children an entirely different way. You could reason with Jay and he had  a sensitive heart, but man, not me. I   d just buck. The worst thing I ever  did was try to run from Daddy when he wanted to paddle me. That  didn   t work. Didn   t do that again.  But see, you must have outgrown that really, really young because I  don   t remember that trait in you at all.  They used discipline as it was needed. Finally, I     Quite a bit was needed. (Laughter)  Apparently so. But I did learn to internalize and control myself. I came  to a totally different place, different style of parenting.  She   s a bona fide red head.  Yep.  Did church play a role in your lifestyle?  Yeah. Southern Baptist church is what we grew up in. At least way back  then, they had what they called cradle roll. Actually, a lot of kids, I  guess, got enrolled in the cradle roll before they were actually born.  From day one, right on up, we were in church.  This George, the great-great-grandfather, was a charter member of the  38  Pixley  Franklin  Pixley  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Finchum  McBee  Pixley  McBee  Finchum  McBee  church we grew up in, that I still attend. Then Dad was raised in the  Christian church, but Mom was Southern Baptist, so she drug him back  to the church he belonged in.  Well, he started going there before he met her.  Is that right?  Yeah, you remember the story about thinking she was someone that he  knew and seeing her in the choir?  He first saw her in the choir and thought she was Francis Frost.  Oh, yeah, that   s true. It   s this woman, they were about the same age and  Francis is passed away, now, but they always did look real similar.  In the war  WWII , up north of town there was a glider field where they  trained glider pilots. There were a lot of those young men in the  community and this church made a real effort to reach out to young  adults, and so I think Daddy had started going there because something  was happening there. A lot of contemporaries and that   s where he met  Mama.  And I farmed that glider field for ten years.  Sometimes it   d rain there when it was dry as a bone, here.  How often do the two of you come back to the farm?  Not as often as we once did. I   m now so far away that    (Laughter)  Although, I   ve gotten back several times this year. When I moved back  to Oklahoma, I lived here north of the house in a trailer for five years  before we moved where we are now. When I moved back, both of our  parents were in pretty frail health and Daddy died during that period of  time, then I was moved about a year and a half before Mama died.  We don   t come and stay as long as we did when Mama was still here.  Yeah.  Last time you drove around on the property?  Oh, now that has been a while. Used to come back and visit and find  time to crawl in something Jay was doing, tractor or combine or  something.  39  Finchum  Franklin  Finchum  Franklin  Finchum  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Finchum  Franklin  McBee  So what   s currently happening on the farm?  If I can get that combine out of here, we need to be cutting beans.  Beans?  Soybeans. I was delayed getting started. Attempted to start Saturday. I  had a real good man that was helping me that I lost to a much better job.  Apparently he had never run that type of combine, which is an extremely  quiet machine. I thought it was ready to go to the field. I pulled it out,  unhooked the corn head, put the soybean head on and was pulling it  back here to service it and go to the field. Threw it in gear to blow the  coons and dirt out of it before I serviced it. As soon as I threw it in gear,  I knew I had a chaffer pitman bearing out, which is a terrible thing when  those bearings go out and you don   t know it. It destroys the chaffer that I  put back together last night and it destroys the chaffer frame that is  laying on the ground behind the combine. So anyway, dropped the  header off back of the combine and tore it down. I   ll have it back  together tonight, and we   ll probably get started cutting beans, finally.  How would you learn how to do all that, though? The mechanical part.  Just on your own?  Dad. He was an excellent, intuitive mechanic, but far preferred to do it  the hard way.  He was intuitive. (Laughs)  If it took a dime part that was available in Vinita, he   d build it. As you  can tell, I   m kind of bent that way, too. But he did it with a cutting torch  and a file and I     If it didn   t take that much finesse, lots of baling wire.  No, he was a pretty rough mechanic, but very intuitive. I   m a little more  into machine work than he was. But anyway.  Yeah, he had an acetylene torch and a vice and that was about it.  He did most of the repairs himself instead of taking them off?  Yeah, he never took anything off, and I don   t.  That was what the early morning work was in the summer. The work  that woke us up. Mechanic work to get everything going again.  40  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Pixley  Franklin  Pixley  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  Pixley  Finchum  Yeah, I overhaul my own engines, transmissions. A machine arrives here  and leaves when it   s sold. It doesn   t ever go to the shop. Do it here. I   m  a much better mechanic than I am an agronomist. I probably survived  because I   m a mechanic and trader instead of a good farmer.  And a good trader, which as I understand was a trait of Grandpa   s.  Yeah. Yeah, I   m bred to be a, as I understand, my grandfather was not  mechanical at all. But he was an exceptional trader. I do take after my  dad. I think I probably put more things back together. We   d take an  equal amount of things apart, but I probably put more of them back  together than he did.  (Laughter) Oh, it wouldn   t have been nearly as funny if I hadn   t thought  about all the things that were in pieces when we cleaned out the house.  Well, yeah, but that was not so good toward the last     I really am intrigued with mechanical and electronic things. I   ve got a  starter/generator tester over there that I bought at an auction for fifteen  dollars and didn   t work. It had a few diodes blown out in it, and for  some reason I left a stereo on the shelf that my wife and I had bought  new and so I tore it apart, robbed the diodes out of it and fitted them in  that machine to get it running. I just     Back to the Simplicity tractor.  (Laughter) Yeah, I don   t mind reading and I don   t mind studying. I  figure if somebody else was smart enough to build it the first time, I can  surely figure out how to fix it.  I think you need to tell about the Erector set clutch that you built when  you were a kid.  The what?  The Erector set clutch, wasn   t it a clutch that you built? Never mind. If  you don   t remember, it   s not a good story.  All I can remember is building chisel plows and tearing up the carpet in  the house.  Oh, boy. That had to be popular.  Let   s end with having each one of you tell a favorite memory from your  farm days. Hard to pick one, but.  41  McBee  Franklin  McBee  Finchum  Pixley  Finchum  Pixley  McBee  Pixley  Franklin  McBee  Franklin  McBee  I think it boils down to family. Having all our family together at maybe a  holiday or maybe just an incidental time. Really enjoying one another in  an atmosphere that   s quiet and full of history. It   s just a nice place to be.  My dad was much more relaxed than I am. There were always a lot of  friends and neighbors around here when I was growing up. This S.B.  Wade, probably my dad   s closest friend, just getting to hang around with  all those old guys.  We were talking as we drove over today that we tended to have, many  times, visitors come in as a family. When we went, it was as a family to  someone else   s family. Not so much Mama having friends and Daddy  having friends that they necessarily socialized with apart from the  others, even though a lot of the men would come around the place or if  you went there while they were working, you could get into the same  sort of thing. But we visited back and forth as a group, which I felt really  enriched our lives.  Carol do you have a favorite?  Oh, not one particular. I guess because I was away so much of the year,  looking forward to coming home for the summer, and I think having  access to things grown in the garden was extra important to me. Even  though it was a lot of work, it was something that I got involved in, too.  It was, compared to institutional food, it was delightful. (Laughter)  Nothing beats a homegrown tomato, does it? Except maybe a peanut  butter and     No  (Laughter)  Blackberry cobbler.  Oh, yeah, that has to be right up there.  My wife is a retired home-ec teacher and farm girl, too. Anyway, Dad  would always talk about his mom making him gooseberry pie.  We never had any gooseberries.  No. It took my wife probably six or eight years to finally come up with  some fresh gooseberries. Anyway, she made him a gooseberry pie. It  was awful. I   d rather have my peanut butter.  The thing that really cinched that was, his mother had made the pie that  42  Pixley  Franklin  Finchum  Franklin  McBee  Pixley  Franklin  Finchum  Franklin  McBee  Finchum  Franklin  Finchum  was to be eaten for lunch. When the house caught on fire, they had  basically eaten their meal, but they hadn   t gotten the gooseberry pie. So  that was something that was always in his mind, that gooseberry pie.  The gooseberry pie burned up with the house. (Laughs)  I forgot that.  We   ll finish with the last question and ask, what do you see for the farm  in the next one hundred years?  Odds are greater than fifty percent that I   m the last operator. I   m the  only one that has children and two of my three kids are very attached to  the farm. I don   t know, if I hold on long enough, my oldest grandson is  pretty mechanical.  Oh, yeah. (Laughs)  That would be something.  I   m confident that the farm will remain in the family because we   re all  financially comfortable enough that it just doesn   t matter and that  history is significant to my kids, so I think it will remain the family  farm. I   m working on a contingency plan with the neighbor that   s twenty  years younger than me. We were trying to develop some partnership to  convert back to cattle again and him likely be the operator when I   m not  able, I would presume, and this Goins family has always been close to  our family. This particular young man was probably one of the favorite  neighbor kids to my folks. There   s a chance that if I stay healthy enough,  my son might come back after his career. But there   s probably going to  be at least a gap in the operation, I would think.  You   ll have to find your house in Vinita. Everybody moves off.  I have my house in Vinita. I   m trying to get out of that house. (Laughter)  Too many steps.  Well, then the no-till acreage, would be trying to keep that in the same  shape? If you   re doing a contingency plan, it would involve keeping the  no-till?  No, no. Everybody else cares more about that than I do. Like I said, my  motivation was economics. I don   t really give a rip.  Just thinking for history, if it   s the oldest one, you   d want to keep going  43  Franklin  Finchum  Franklin  Finchum  Pixley  McBee  with it.  It   ll be grass. It   ll be grass within the next, I   m fifty-five, it   ll be grass  within the next ten, twelve years. Unless you convince me to contribute  it to Extension for research. I thought the crop production was going to  come to an end here four years ago. That was kind of the plan at that  point. Four years ago, I went to work for VoTech as the Ag-business  coordinator. The motivation was a little odd. This part needs to be edited  out in case any of my neighbors read this. (Laughter) VoTech  approached me and I turned them down because it didn   t pay enough  and they didn   t find who they wanted and they came back and figured  out a way to make the pay significantly more and I had a lot of help. The  issue was I had gone through three expansions. One was intentional, two  were accidental. The last one, two times I had come back to just farming  what the family and my wife and I owned.  The last time, all the neighbors here started dying and retiring and I  ended up farming way more than I wanted to again. I didn   t have the  heart to tell these neighbors that I didn   t want to farm the land, so I went  to work for VoTech just as an excuse. I had three people working at the  time and the idea was they don   t need me. I   ll go do something fun and  that   ll give me an excuse to get rid of all this rented land. That plan  didn   t work out very well. All three of those guys left within months. So  I really had a struggle since then. Then I left VoTech and went to the  bank at Vinita. At that point, in 2006, the intent was to start grassing  everything down, get it back to cattle and be a bi-vocational operator.  Then all the sudden, crop production got really lucrative so I stayed put.  I prefer machinery and crops to livestock anyway. When this bubble  ends with high priced crops, I   ll start migrating back to beef cattle like  I   d intended.  Always thinking ahead.  Yeah, but be willing to change path because the path will change.  Well if that   s it, then we   ll go ahead and thank you for your time. It   s  been a pleasure meeting and hearing your story. Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  -------  -------
