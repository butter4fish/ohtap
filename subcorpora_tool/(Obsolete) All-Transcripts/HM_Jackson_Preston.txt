Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Okay, I have to admit I did have a time with this part of the questionnaire; we filled all of that out you know. But I had to have some assistance you know from my daughter and one of my nephews because there's one that's doing a book on our family. But I, so I may make a few mistakes you know it's just too much for my head to hold, a little southern expression you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Okay. All right. What is her date of birth and place of birth?

Speaker 1: And was she born in Decatur [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, no, my parents are from the South, around Kentucky and Tennessee. My mom is from Tennessee; my dad started off in Kentucky and moved to Fruitvale, Tennessee later on.
Speaker 1: Okay so is your, was your mother from Fruitvale, Tennessee?
Speaker 2: Yeah she was from that area; let's call it Dy, Dyers, Dyersburg, D-Y-E-R-S (simultaneous).

Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Beautiful country.
Speaker 1: All right, well what do you know about your mother's side of the family, how far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well I, I knew that my mother and father were very much in love upon their meeting, and dedicated themselves to each other in a true sense of the word.
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask you about that, but I--
Speaker 2: Oh, oh.
Speaker 1: I'll ask you about that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, I wanna know how far back can you trace mother's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Oh man okay I'm completely off. God it goes back to, well her father and possibly her grandmother. Now this is just word of mouth stuff that I heard, her father was yeah, he was kind of gigolo. And, and her parents on the Boykin side I think, yeah and this is getting into slavery now, this goes all the way back. But they worked; they were more into timber that type of labor, forest, okay, you know according to the stories. They were short, squat-like people probably from West Africa, most people were. But they had distinct features that I can see today, am I going off in tangents?
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: I'm right on, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah I wanna know about them.
Speaker 2: Okay. Yeah they worked in, they worked in turpentine, forest and one of her fathers, was known for shoulders as wide and only five feet tall. Most of them were very short, but they were as wide as they were high. And he would always perform feats in the camp, camps, work camps like breaking barrels of turpentine. Or opening barrels with his head and stuff like that, tho- those are stories, but I hear them often you know. And that's all, oh yeah my mother's sisters they are all, Native American, Choctaw and she is also quarter, it's in our blood for sure. Because I didn't realize how much it was in our blood until we used to go down south to visit them. And her sisters were all reddish complexion and they had (laughter) you know their eyes angled, you know. I mean really drastically, I mean you know, this whole, I, I, in fact my eyes do the same thing. And I had to have them operated on to lift them because shit, they were, shoot they were closing you know. And (laughter) where did this come from?
Speaker 1: Did you really have your eyes--
Speaker 2: Yeah I really did man, I mean, it's like I was looking like some kind of a beaver or something you know. And I, I really high cheekbones, but boy my, my mother's sisters were pretty, so pretty you know. They was just a mixture of different races you know, European, African and Indian. But what was so distinct was their Asian like features, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's, that's how much I can remember about her.
Story_ID: 364913
Speaker 1: Are there any stories that come from that side of the family [Jackson's maternal family] that are passed down about life maybe immediately after slavery or during slavery?
Speaker 2: Well I know that my father [T.J. Jackson, Sr.] had to take her [Jackson's mother, Shirley Armstrong Jackson] and they had to come north, because of her ways, her personality. She was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now this is your grandmother?
Speaker 2: This was my, my mother.
Speaker 1: Oh your mother?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father, when they got married down there, they immediately had to come south [sic.] because he was afraid for her. Because she would not allow anyone to speak to her and, in a way that she was you know super- inferior.
Speaker 1: Did your mother, did she grow up in Tennessee?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah she grew in the South.
Speaker 1: Did she talk about going to school there and--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah very bright woman, she, education was the first and foremost, she was part of that period you know the Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] period, up the Negro race. And the renaissance period and pride and she was a part of that heavily seeped in that. My father was more agriculture related you know more into the land, he, he just knew so much about the land and yes he also mentioned Native Americans. You know how they used to pass through areas where they lived you know.  And, and his encountering, but she, she definitely was a very proud woman, even when you know when no one was interested in, in the piano playing the piano. She always had you know there was musical instruments all over the house, you know.
Speaker 1: Did she play the piano?
Speaker 2: Yeah a little bit, not as much and we used to laugh because her singing voice was just pitiful you know. But she would always make sure that you know being from a family of ten kids you know that we all got musical backgrounds and we all went to college. And, and I, I swear that was from that not having and proving yourself, that was a time. Like so many African American families you know, everyone was in, into that. That was the time, a great period.
Story_ID: 364914
Speaker 1: Can you give us now your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's what?
Speaker 1: Full name and spell it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, T.J. Jackson [T.J. Jackson, Sr.], initials T.J. Jackson.
Speaker 1: Now the initials stand for a name?
Speaker 2: Thomas Jacob some says, I mean I don't know, they're very careful, they're very, about that you know, I don't know why the T.J. is such a mystery you know and (laughter) I mean of course in those days even then there're a lot of nicknames you know. You know initials were, you know the railroad guys, that, that was a very big habit you know African Americans given initials and surnames and, and fun names you know. People had four or five names, I remember he had two or three names that he answered by, but T.J. is his official name, T.J. Jackson.
Speaker 1: Yeah there are a quite a few people in the South having so many nicknames that you--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah you forget you know, I mean some names go away as people get older you know, I guess those are childhood names.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Nineteen o'five [1905], and this, this is in Kentucky, I was corrected by my, one of my nephews because I knew that he was from Fruitvale [Tennessee], I mean all I heard that Fruitvale, Tennessee and Dyersburg [Tennessee] and Humboldt [Tennessee], these were the names. A cluster of cites that connected by Indian [Native American] trails, old Indian trails you know.
Speaker 1: Now what place in Kentucky?
Speaker 2: In Kentucky, Louisville.
Speaker 1: Louisville?
Speaker 2: Right around Louisville uh-huh in that area, and so this is kind of new to me, this information about, he was actually born in Kentucky. And I said oh wow, after all these years, and he would always say Tennessee, I guess (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was he raised in Tennessee?
Speaker 2: Pardon, yeah--
Speaker 1: Was he raised in Tennessee?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right uh-huh. Probably just born there for a short period and moved to Tennessee, and that's where he was raised.
Speaker 1: Okay now what do you know about your father's side of the family; how far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: Well you know somehow we got more information on him than we did our mother [Shirley Armstrong Jackson], he can, he can still tell you about slavery. Not that he experienced it but from his grandmother and his great-grandmother you know, he, he was fortunate enough to, to see her, or to hear. And she mentioned all the things that, the main things that he remembered about that period was the whelps on her back from being whipped you know. She wore them like a badge, ironically you know it was like a badge to her, and, and then he would tell stories. Not stories but rebuild histories handed down, oral histories of the existence and the plantation system, and many things he would talk about was how the children were fed. Eating out of a long trough and because he could, you know Pap [ph.] and some other, these are slave names. There was a guy called Pap and Punch [ph.] and, these, there were were men in his, his family. But mainly he would tell us about how the children were called and they all gathered around a trough and eat. And they wore like sack clothing from something that looks like a feed sack. And you know when I really concentrate on that stuff; I mean I can just come up with all kinds of history. And it's a lot of my work, a lot of my bronze sculpture is about the tales of stories that, I, I get from him. That's as far back, I mean as far as connections that you know learning from him that I know about his family.
Story_ID: 364915
Speaker 1: I knew there was a guy called Elijah and he was the plantation owner, he was Jackson, Elijah [Elisha Jackson]. And he wore, he rode a white horse, you know one horse that was rather poorly kept, but this is what he [Jackson's father, T.J. Jackson, Sr.] remembers. And you know talking to his mother [Julia Boykin] and his mother about it; we were able to acquire a picture of him, a photograph of him.
Speaker 2: Of Elijah Jackson?
Speaker 1: Elijah Jackson, yeah, long beard, long white beard, sitting on a horse you know, and, and this was a person. We acquired that from our white side of the family, you know our European side of the family, because the two families started you know to speak to each other. And this wasn't too long ago; this was like in the '90s [1990s] they decided to become a family and one nephew, Sam, Samuel Starks. He's the only nephew that, he's the only member of the family that aggressively sought and acquired the history of our family. And he made friends with the European side of our family, and they were talking about a reunion, and some wonderful things. But they gave him a picture of Elijah on this horse; he says, "That's your great-great-great-grandfather," or something like that you know.
Speaker 2: This is unusual since that a lot of black people can't tell that history. They know they were, their family was in slavery but they can't, they have no stories.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, right.
Speaker 2: For one reason or another the stories aren't passed down.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Or they're too painful or what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --to be passed down.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But you're unique in that you can tell your story.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh. It's almost like war wounds, psychological war wounds you know, you don't wanna talk about it. It's like coming out of a war. And psychologically it is, it was, to talk, to talk and to think of something so dark, something so bad you know. He sometimes, he would accidentally or slip and tell me stories that he, he never spoke about before. Why me, I don't know, but he was interested in the fact that I was an artist, I wanted to be an artist. And even then in those early days, I was proving myself as an artist. So he would tell me things, especially leaving, leaving Fruitvale [Tennessee] one day, a Model T Ford [Ford Model T] coming up here. And why he had to come up here, why he had to leave his wife [Shirley Armstrong Jackson] and come up here and establish himself. But one story that stuck in my, my mind was this mass of goo hanging from a tree, and it, it you know it looks like a cocoon dipped in, in oil you know. But it had been there for days and unrecognizable. And he was telling Clemmie [Clementine Jackson], my oldest sister, 'cause she you know inquired, and, and he said something, "Oh, that's just an old scarecrow," or something like that. And later he told me it was a body, and he says, "Oh so and so is lynched, oh this, that boy. Yeah that boy, they got him, you know, and they lynched him, and that's where he hung, and we didn't even look at him when we drove you know."
Speaker 2: Yeah that's quite, but that happened while he was a young man?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Saw that when he was young?
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: So here's a story of I guess the terror of--
Speaker 1: Yeah this is lynchings, lynchings 1914 don't know why the dates don't mean nothing because it happened so many times (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well right after slavery to--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --sometimes now you know.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: In rare instances I guess.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: But okay, so he had a lot of stories and these were basically around Fruitville, Tennessee?
Speaker 1: Fruitvale.
Speaker 2: Fruitvale.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh. A lot of my work is based on things that happened around Fruitvale County [sic. Fruitvale, Crockett County, Tennessee]. Julieanne, my show at the culture center [Chicago Cultural Center, Chicago, Illinois] is called 'Julieanne's Garden,' 'Fresh from Julieanne's Garden.' And we did go visit her grave and my nephew Sammy, he discovered all the stuff, he photographed the grave and everything. And we're planning a reunion but there, there was her grave Julieanna, this person who my dad talked about. And the things he, he talked about the women and the family, they were huge women and the most humorous stories was that their breast were huge. And most of the women in the family served, especially the one during slavery as nursemaid, nursemaids. Not nursemaids, they're called wet--
Speaker 2: Wet nurses.
Speaker 1: Wet nurses, and the story he said her breast were so long, he would a, she could put one on her back and feed a child, and one on her front (laughter). And we, it was a big joke in the family but it was true you know, 'cause my Uncle Ollie [Ollie Jackson], "Yeah, but T.J. shouldn't tell you kids that stuff (laughter)." But you know, got a lot of stuff.
Speaker 2: Yeah so he had a lot of good stories, seem like a lot of constructive stories about what life was really like.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: When he was growing up.
Speaker 1: Right, right it was very colorful. I see my past in, in Technicolor you know and that makes it more vivid I don't know why. But it makes it clear to me. I think my dyslexia, my left-handedness; my everything that I am that I read about seems to point to something special, something that has to do with creativity, becoming an artist
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know.
Story_ID: 364916
Speaker 1: Tell us how your parents [Shirley Armstrong Jackson and T.J. Jackson, Sr.] met now, you started to tell us a little while ago. How did they meet?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think it was at some type of social event that they'd have, I mean I can see it in, in Technicolor you know the straw hats and the type of long dresses. And, and the preachers, some type of church picnic, yeah, yeah, yeah. And, and he remember you know, he says, "I like that gal," he called her gal all the time. He says, "I'm gonna marry that gal," and he boldly went up to her, he says, "I'm gonna marry you." And she in a very shy but typical way that she was she pushed him, you know (laughter) and then he told me he says they ended up. And he picked her up in his surrey, his wagon, I mean automobiles were plentiful, but they were rural people. He picked her up in his horse; he was a red, beautiful horse. I think my father's family was a little wealthy you know. They, they had money you know, and picked her up in, in the surrey and he drove her, and I can remember that's what he said, he picked her up in that.
Speaker 1: Okay now when did they move to--
Speaker 2: Illinois?
Speaker 1: Decatur [Illinois], yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay they came to Illinois in the '20s [1920s] yeah in 1920s; see one of his brothers, Ollie [Ollie Jackson] he was already here. And one stayed in Louisville [Kentucky], that's why we have that Louisville connection, 'cause I have two or three uncles over there. But anyway they, my father came up here first and sent for them later, my Uncle Ollie, my cousins tell me the story of how it was done. My father came up to look for work you know at Wagner's foundry [Wagner Castings Co., Decatur, Illinois] and ironically I turned out to teach foundry courses you know at Western Illinois Univ- University [Western Illinois University, Macomb, Illinois]. And I taught foundry here, here at SAIC [School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] but that's kind of strange he was a foundry man, definitely a laborer and I think of him as a technician. You know because workers run companies, and in those days you know the whole idea of unions were getting started or been or they were always but you know that was the height of the unionist movements. And the whole idea ever since anyway, but he was, but he was definitely a part of that movement. He came up first and he decided to send for her later, but he was getting a little bit wild, too much freedom you know (laughter). And they can go anyplace, didn't have to have a pass, they can drive their cars anyplace, buy anything they liked. They lived in Negro towns you know, every city had a Negro town, and every state had sundown towns all over the place. But--
Speaker 1: How would you describe a suntown, sundown town?
Speaker 2: Sundown towns mean you couldn't go; you couldn't stay there after the sun goes down.
Speaker 1: So you could--
Speaker 2: Blacks had to drive through those towns or around them, and I, I experienced that you know playing music in the Chitlin' Circuit you know. I knew the towns that we couldn't you know Pekin, Illinois, Pana, Illinois, Vandalia [Illinois], Centralia [Illinois], Delavan [Illinois], these were sundown cities. Even today, parents will tell their young kids little hip hoppers you know don't go to these cities because these are trouble cities, these are sundown cities. But my father he came here and the Negro sides of every town like in Tulsa [Oklahoma] you know you have Langston [Oklahoma] and places like that, we, we have them all over. So in Decatur there was one, and he was getting a little fast (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was it called? I'm sorry, but what was it called in Decatur what was the black side of town called?
Speaker 2: Well there were four of them and always across the tracks in swampy areas, nasty areas and there was west side [West End, Decatur, Illinois], east side, east end was, east end was kind of a real dangerous area. Then there was, dangerous to the, to the same people, I mean you know black on black crime you know. Then there was north end, so every direction we had sundown ti-, we had black cities. Because of the influx, I mean people who came he, migrated from the South to get to Chicago [Illinois]; they stopped off in places like Decatur and Peoria, Illinois. And Clinton, Illinois, not very many and Springfield, Illinois after the riots, black people left those places, and they came back.  But my, my dad witnessed, he was a part of that and later my uncle persuaded him to send for Shirley, and they called her Duke [ph.] at that time. And to bring her up so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Duke?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Why did they call her Duke?
Speaker 2: She had a boyish way about her I mean, she, she would, she would beat the crap out of men you know. She protected her family like a samurai or a, a, kung fu warrior you know. She was, she was something to deal with, I was terrified of her (laughter). My dad I can handle, but she was the, the disciplinarian.
Story_ID: 364917
Speaker 1: We were just discussing, you went to school with James Loewen who wrote the book, 'Sundown Towns' ['Sundown Towns: A Hidden Dimension of American Racism'] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well we were in the same city, same age and everything, but when I read his book, Loewen's book on sundown cities you know it just perked my ears up and it's like I, I knew then that I'm on the right track, I'm doing the right thing.  You know my work is definitely going in the right direction, because he mentioned all of the cities that I lived around in Illinois.  That I'd gone through, and I, the cities that my dad [T.J. Jackson, Sr.] told me not to go through you know or not time, because these were sundown cities.
Speaker 1: They are, they, most people would not realize necessarily in the middle of Illinois to the southern part of Illinois is very southern.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Extremely southern--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the sense in the social sense.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And it's more like the South than it is the North.
Speaker 2: I know it, yeah, you get past Vandalia [Illinois], hell you can grow cotton (laughter) I mean it's like it's no difference.  I just didn't know that, we didn't, we you know as children and growing in, you know when that thing happened to Emmett Till that's when my mind, that's when I said, I, I in fact my father wouldn't take us back down South.  Me and Timmit--Emmett, Emmett Till same age, same everything, and when we went down south I remember something similar that could have happened to me.  Scared the hell out of me man, because I had that same attitude that Emmett Till had, and my father just quietly said, "Shirley [Shirley Armstrong Jackson], we won't take him back."  And the rest of the children got to go back down south.
Speaker 1: Well okay so your father's working in Decatur [Illinois] at a foundry [Wagner Castings Co.], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's a foundry man and--
Speaker 1: About the time that you were born, how many years did you live in Decatur?
Speaker 2: Oh, I, I don't know up, I stayed there until I was what twenty-six or something like that, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean I, I met my wife Melba [Melba Jackson], she's from Clinton [Illinois] about twenty miles from Decatur, a sundown city you know just like Maroa [Illinois] but we had to go through Maroa, but anyway, yeah my whole life is centered in Decatur, Illinois.
Story_ID: 364918
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, yeah.  I think I was you know very young I painted my tricycle, I think I was about five years old or something like that you know.
Speaker 1: So did you paint it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My twin [Priscilla Jackson Kirk]--
Speaker 1: Did you have a watercolor, what, what did you use?
Speaker 2: My, my twin sister and I we found some paint from I don't know it, it was airplane paint that they painted [U.S.] Navy planes with and boy, wow we got a buzz even then.  But I remember 'cause it smelled funny you know and painted our tricycles, but that's the earliest thing I can remember.  I can remember we had animals, we had chickens.  Because my parents [Shirley Armstrong Jackson and T.J. Jackson, Sr.] had not gotten over the Depression [Great Depression], people were still shaken up by what happened you know.  And, and them being from farm cities in the South you know, they brought all of that with them.  So we had a lot of animals, we had pets and then we had what is an edible pet, pets but I can't say that.  We had pets that were, we had chickens and, and all foul animals, feathered animals, oh rabbits too, so a couple fury little suckers there.  But that I remember, I remember an outhouse you know because we were scared to, I mean all, I mean I just remember holding on to my sister's hand.  My twin sister on one side of, Nitell [Nitell Jackson Starks] that's one of my sisters, and I'm on the other side, and they would always protect us and lead us around to places.
Speaker 1: How many of you, how many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: Ten we have ten, actually there were twelve, two died in the South way before me and--
Speaker 1: Were you the youngest or?
Speaker 2: No, I have two under me.
Speaker 1: Two under you. All right. Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 364919
Speaker 1: What was some of the, what was your neighborhood like, were you in the country sort of like or semi country?
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, we were in the city [Decatur, Illinois].
Speaker 1: In the city.
Speaker 2: Yeah beautiful area of town, it was a mixed neighborhood.  We had Germans on one end and well a little later on there was one Japanese kid and it was a mixed neighborhood, yeah.  We really didn't know anything about a neighborhood that was all black, but we understood that the majority was black.  And we understood what we all had in common, it was only 'til we went to school that it, it really dawned on us that we were different.  You know kindergarten, that we were different and the jokes you know from slapstick stuff.  The old vaudeville stuff from movies and, then it really sunk in and that was how we treated each other.  What was funny and what was laughable you know and, and all of the humor that came out of being black and the cartoons, especially Disney [The Walt Disney Company] cartoons.  And, and the guy [E.C. Segar] that did Popeye and Betty Boop you know, different cartoonist, but comic books especially Al Capp was very hard on, on black culture.  Yeah, yeah it and so it crept, consciousness crept into our minds, and the irony of it all, most of it we saw as funny, until we reached an age whereas we had to be bus boys and we were treated different.  And we begin to note that there were eating establishments that we could not go into.

Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well to me the sights were the automobiles of the 1940s, you know I'm a pretty serious collector of automobiles now.  I have quite a, the garage filled with cars now, but what really caught my attention was General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] and the cars that took on, took on a rather cartoonish like appearance.  There could've been hap-, I mean it could've have happened the other way around but Buicks to me were things with, automobiles you know humongous things with teeth.  And they never stayed still even when they're stopped they would move, this is my imagination though and to work you know.  And then automobiles that were streamlined that were coupes and had straight backs you know reminded me of the large water bugs that would be in our kitchen when we turned on the light and they'd scurry.  And I had the, I had a strange childhood as far as my imagination and I expressed these things you know.  And my dyslexia was something that I had to deal with, because I couldn't understand it words moving on a page and me reading from you know right to left.  And, and seeing pictures of words, I mean creating pictures of words.  But anyway those are the earliest memories of, of my awareness of the environment.  The sights and smells flowers, there was always heavy areas of vegetation.  Elm trees you don't see anymore elm trees, when I was a kid elm tree leaves were like the size of both my hands.  These were Dutch elms huge things, the trees were so big around you couldn't put your arms around them, and they lined Sunset you know.  I'm working on a book very beautiful book, quite poetic and I got quite a few pages completed.  But I speak about Sunset, and Sunset Avenue that's the street I lived on [in Decatur, Illinois] you know, and the sounds and smells at dip-, at dinnertime, suppertime.  It's a combination of the sun going down and smelling collard greens at the same time.  It, it triggered emotional responses in every child you know.
Story_ID: 364921
Speaker 1: Now how did you, you say you were dyslexic.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you have trouble--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --reading in school? That sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, right I mean yeah, we didn't know what it was, no one gave it a name, you know they put you in the corner and put a dunce cap on your head, a pointed hat.
Speaker 1: Actually, they would actually would do that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I've seen it in movies, but I never seen.
Speaker 2: Oh they would do that.  My thing was they put me and Len, Len Jackson [ph.] and another kid Williford, Jean Williford [ph.] and Michael [ph.]; they put us in the cloakroom.  And we had to go in the dark cloakroom and--
Speaker 1: Because you couldn't--
Speaker 2: Because we were slow in math and reading and all of that, we were just slow.  I would sit in the cloakroom and draw.  I'd fill up little books with papers, I mean with drawings on the edges of the papers you know.  I mean wonderful little drawings, when we'd come out, I'd completed a sketch book you know (laughter).  But you know I overcame those things you know especially you know the body, the mind will adjust.  Reading became very simple for me because, easier as time went on because I had all these formulas I had created.  You know like the word little, little, the word look became a pair of eyeglasses you know.  The word little was camel with two humps in his back you know, and the zeroes became faces and bubbles, it's, it's all of those little tricks that one finds.  Because the teachers didn't pay any attention, they were all white you know, and they didn't care whether, they didn't care.  And this lasted all the way through high school [Stephen Decatur High School, Decatur, Illinois] and parts of college you know.  Where I, I, went to school at Millikin University [Decatur, Illinois], same thing, and I was aware of those things.  Not hurt by it you know later on, I become, I became a little bit annoyed you know.
Speaker 1: Now when did, when did you start to draw?
Speaker 2: To draw, when I was the age seven; I was seven years old and comic books, definitely comic books.  You know Al Capp's cartoon like comic books, I wasn't too crazy about Al Capp's philosophy and beliefs now that's now, especially in the '60s [1960s].  I was aware and some of the statements, but I loved his drawing and his storytelling and comic book of, of you know abilities.  But of course they were several companies with drawings, and that's where, and that's when.
Story_ID: 364922
Speaker 1: What school did you first, did you start at?
Speaker 2: Oakland.
Speaker 1: Oakland School [Decatur, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Oakland School one of those really old schools you know started back or out of World War I [WWI] and lasted probably before that you know.  And terrified at having to go to school, very shy all the way through high school [Stephen Decatur High School, Decatur, Illinois].  I remember nothing good about my high school years, I don't, except the fact I formed a band, and finally I got some attention.  You know short people you know I'm five, seven and it's like I, I had complexes you know.  I mean even this bump in my nose a terrible thing, because these comic books, anyone who, you know cowboys you wear black hat and you had a hump in your nose.  Well shit I had all of that you know (laughter) and I used to put clay, brown clay that we used to make things in, I put it right here (gesture) so I can even out this hump.  And then we go out for recess and my hump would fall off, and my little indentation to get rid of, fall off on the--and people would step on it and I'm picking it (laughter) I trying, this is how bad it was you know.
Speaker 1: You were trying to, now I'm trying to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Trying to smooth out my nose with a piece of clay.
Speaker 1: All right. There is a scar here, is that what you were trying to do?
Speaker 2: Well that happened, I had a humpy nose anyway, but that happened when me and Ora Lee Hill [ph.] at the age of seven went down the hill on a skate scooter.  Something that looks like today's skateboards, but we made it ourselves so we didn't have sense enough to bend the nails down.  And we hit the end of the driveway and the, you know they had that little water thing, and we both went forward and a nail stuck in my nose you know.  So that was a--
Speaker 1: Now I don't know if you realize it or not at this age that, that you are, you really don't have a hump in your nose (laughter).  Your nose, your nose doesn't look any different, I don't know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Does the videographer agree?
Speaker 2: After time.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): (Unclear).
Speaker 2: I can't see what you're talking about. I mean people have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Maybe it, maybe it fattened up or something.
Speaker 2: Yeah people have I guess perceptions of themselves.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: That if there, if their family, somebody in their family teases them about--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They really exaggerate some feature and making more than it is.
Speaker 1: You hit it right on the head.
Speaker 2: I'm talking too much about this but--
Speaker 1: It made me conscious of it.
Speaker 2: But, but I don't think that I, I'm just looking this, and I can't see it.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: I can't see it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I do not see it.
Speaker 1: But you're right about that, yeah it's created.  But I do have a pre-, a beautiful sister (laughter) her name is Yvonne [Alice Yvonne Jackson Joyner]; I named my daughter after Yvonne, Alice Yvonne [ph.].  And she had a distinct nose shaped like that, she was the most beautiful, all of my sisters are beautiful you know.  But she was, she was dark skinned and smooth dark skin you know she had, she was the most beautiful sister I had you know, loved her.
Story_ID: 364923
Speaker 1: When you went to grade school, now you, you're at Oakland elementary school [Oakland School, Decatur, Illinois], right.
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you, did you have a favorite subject you know in all the things that you--
Speaker 2: I don't remember, I don't remember.
Speaker 1: You said it was tough in there, and sounds like they were mistreating you.
Speaker 2: Yeah drawing was naturally, art was just natural for me; I just did that naturally, so if there were a subject that I was aware of, yeah I guess it would be art.  But even then I wasn't aware of it because it was too much, too many other things complexes and questioning you know.  Why am I black you know, I mean why is my hand light on one side and dark on the other side you know.  And what about this big woman in the cartoons that, that chased Tom the cat around with a broom that we never see (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh the black woman? Supposedly the black woman?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and we don't see her head or anything, we just see her feet (laughter). I mean I'm dealing with all of that you know.  So in school I can't concentrate because my imagination is, is just going nuts and this is true, this is very true.
Speaker 1: So now did you, did you have any opportunity to sculpt when you were that age (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No just in clay as we played with clay, but I never thought of it as being art, it you know I didn't equate that with as, with making art, but I did it anyway.  My earliest art object was an alligator out of clay that was fired in a kiln, and boy I loved that thing you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, how old were you then?
Speaker 2: Oh maybe seven you know yeah, seven or eight years old I remember that.
Speaker 1: Did, was there a favorite teacher or anything in grade, in grade school?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh, no, no.  Because they were faceless, they didn't live, live in the neighborhood, they'd come in and leave.  And--
Speaker 1: Teachers were all white you said?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There was no such thing a black teacher (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was your school all black? Was your school mostly black?
Speaker 2: No it was heavily integrated, perfectly integrated I should say.
Speaker 1: Almost 50/50?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, the kids were bused in, kids we call the country kids they came in on buses, they were white kids from farm areas.  But I knew that they were all of them more privileged in some way, I wanted their hair, I wanted their complexion, I wanted their language.  Right from the get go, right from the beginning I knew there was something inferior about me and us, the kids.  There were never any black patrol boys that would stand and let, the kids pass by when the traffic is down.  Only one and that's when I left school at Oakland, Willie Billingsley [ph.] he was chosen to be a tri-, a patrol boy.  We were very proud of him you know, you know, "Go Willie," you know.  We didn't say (laughter)--
Speaker 1: I know that was a big deal in those days.
Speaker 2: It was a big deal.
Speaker 1: And they got a belt with a badge.
Speaker 2: Right man.
Speaker 1: And a pole, did you have a pole with a flag on it?
Speaker 2: No but they had that belt, they thought it was close to being a policemen or something (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, yeah so well did you have any idea what you wanted to be when you were in grade school?
Speaker 2: No, no I really didn't, you know I had a pet guinea pig, and, and I carved an automobile.  See I'm trying to look for clues as, 'cause maybe I did, but things, these things.
Speaker 1: But you carved an automobile (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when you were in grade school?
Speaker 2: Right, right, I carved an early hot rod you know the days of hot rods they, they were around back then you know in the '40s [1940s].  I carved one you know it's like, and let's see clay, oh scooters, skate scooters and little race cars.  Soap box derbies but we, we didn't call them then, we didn't call that then, we just made some contraption with wheels on it.  I tried designing them, yeah, so wow.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's--
Speaker 2: You're bringing out some stuff man, this is like a psychoanalysis kind of session, but that was it.
Speaker 1: Now what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I hadn't said that in a long time.
Story_ID: 364924
Speaker 1: What about music did, was there a house filed with music or what kind of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: What kind of music, radio?
Speaker 2: Well radio, record players, old pianos, saxophones and I, I didn't think that anyone could read music and pre- reproduce something like that that's on paper.  And then 'til my sister she was given piano lessons and my brother Laudell [Laudell Jackson] was given piano lessons.  And, and both of them I would just pick up their instruments and start playing it, almost any song I wanted you know.  And from Duke Ellington's records and you know Count Basie; I had that ability to hear.  And that came from the need to express what I heard you know.
Speaker 1: Okay that's quite the, so musical talent and artistic talent?
Speaker 2: Yeah they sort evolved together, you know I used to make guitars out of cigar, cigar boxes and I'd, listening to music, I trained my ear.  Because I would sit, I would lay in front of the record player for hours listening to my sister Clemmie's [Clementine Jackson] records.  Duke Ellington's 'Black, Tan and Beige' [sic. 'Black, Brown and Beige'] memorized every word that Louis, Louis anyway Louis Armstrong of course, but, Louis Jordan.
Speaker 1: Louis Jordan.
Speaker 2: Yeah I, I knew, knew the music backwards you know.  I could hum difficult improvisational lines you know and that was a time.
Story_ID: 364925
Speaker 1: Was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well church was a big part of my family, yes, and, and we had to do it you know, but in an emotional sense, and really believing I question more than most of my siblings.  Because I, I just couldn't buy it even at an early age, that people could go in the ground and go into you know, to go to the devil.  The devil lives down there, I couldn't buy that you know and, the idea of going to heaven and, and dealing with wearing a white robe and all that shit.  It sound nice you know, but the milk and honey thing you know I didn't even like milk you know it gave me gas, and, and so I didn't want to go to heaven to get gas (laughter).
Speaker 1: So did you, was there a name of your family church? What was the name or your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah it was Antioch Baptist Church [Antioch Missionary Baptist Church, Decatur, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah there's an old man by the name of Reverend Fields [P.W. Fields], and we had to sing in the choir and all that.  I remember getting into a fight with Darlene Echols [ph.] and boy fighting in the church, and you know she beat the shit out of me you know.  But she was like, Darlene you know real strong, large and, but boy did I get a bawling out when I went home.  You know for fighting in the church you just don't do that.  And my real, only real association and closeness to the church was when I was sixteen and I was able to drive my father [T.J. Jackson, Sr.] to, he was a pastor, he was a, a minister.  And I would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, your father was a minister?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, right.
Speaker 1: In the same church?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh he had a church in Mattoon, Illinois.
Speaker 1: In Mattoon?
Speaker 2: A sundown city you know at one time.  But I would drive him to his church when I was able to drive, I remember those long trips.  I remember our conversations, I remember him practicing his sermons you know that he did on the spur of the moment you know.  So skillfully at you know doing that stuff.
Story_ID: 364926
Speaker 1: Did your grades improve gradually or did they stay about the same?
Speaker 2: Gradually, but very gradually.  When I went to high school, I, I became interested in art, I became, I knew what it was about you know.  I started understanding, that was during the beatnik periods you know and everyone wanted to be cool.  And, and I, sports I had to do that, because of my brother Laudell [Laudell Jackson] he, he set records you know, I could run fast naturally.  I never looked at it as something you had to work at, because we had foot races on Sunset Avenue [Decatur, Illinois] every night you know.  It was half of a quarter of a mile, so that was a pretty good distance you know?  Run, running barefooted on hot pavement as fast as you could, and I, I was the king (laughter).  So going to school and running it just came natural, I never had to practice, and I, I did break his record.  You know I did the hundred yard dash in nine point, 9.7 [seconds] you know and that was good (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's fast.
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Pretty fast.
Speaker 2: Yeah and then I got beat, Darnell [ph.] from Danville [Illinois] he did a 9.3, but I set records and, and I soon stopped.  I just stopped you know just like Pres [Lester Young] did on his sax, he just stopped playing music.  I stopped doing sports because I felt like I was slave on a plantation, and I wondered why did the coach care so much about our abilities.  And I figured it out, he was saving his job, we were running for him, and so I quit.  One day I took--
Speaker 1: What, what was the name of your high school, was it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Stephen Decatur High School [Decatur, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Oh Decatur High School.
Speaker 2: One day I took off those sweaty clothes, I played halfback as a football, in football because I was fast.  And one day the bus brought us back downtown, I took off those stinky clothes you know those damn pads and, and grass stains, smelly things and never went back.
Speaker 1: How old were you, were, were you a senior, junior?
Speaker 2: I think I was about seventeen you know and I, I was selected to, as president of the art club by Mrs. Bleeks [Justean Bleeks] and she saved me you know.  Says, "You don't have to play sports," you know.
Speaker 1: So were you a junior in high school then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I, I was a junior.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And formed a little band, and started doing the things that I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: That's interesting per- perspective for those days because sports is so big in the black community (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well Jackie Robinson started it, him and Joe Louis man they really (laughter), I'm a little guy and I had to you know what I mean keep up that image man you know.  Yeah sports, sports, sports, sports.  I did not like sports, I don't, even today I, I love automobile racing you know.  Maybe automobile rally sports, Le Mans [24 Hours of Le Mans, Le Mans, France] type performance automobiles, that British automobiles and, but no straight line stuff, or NASCAR [National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing] stuff I don't like that.
Story_ID: 364927
Speaker 1: Well did you like pursue like a college path of study in high school or did you just general course (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No I never had any idea that I could go to college 'til that last year I begin to say, you know my drawing is great, how far can I go with this you know?  And just the word college popped up you know, so I started, started, started going to night school at Millikin University [Decatur, Illinois].  Taking two credit hours a year, I mean that's doing it the hard way you know.
Speaker 1: Now this is after high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is after high school.
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from Stephen Decatur [Stephen Decatur High School, Decatur, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-one [1961] '62 [1962] something like that, and I got out and I decided to further my education.  But I was aware of the fact I had terrible weaknesses especially in writing and history and math you know.  It was no way I could go to college you know, but I did it anyway, I concentrated on the art classes you know.  I just felt that, well I'll handle that you know that core, courses later you know.  And I did, I actually overcame a lot of that stuff, I had to have a tutor, and my skills just multiplied.  Graduated with a 4.0 [grade point average] you know and just great grades.
Story_ID: 364928
Speaker 1: So, graduated from Stephen Decatur High School [Decatur, Illinois] in '62 [1962] or so and you started taking classes at what's the name of the school?
Speaker 2: Millikin University [Decatur, Illinois], I went to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Milligan?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Millikin
Speaker 1: M-I-L-L-I-G-A-N?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, K-I, K-I-N.
Speaker 1: K, oh Millikin?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay Millikin University.
Speaker 2: Millikin.
Speaker 1: That's right there in Decatur [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm yeah.  Millikin was a, you know we, we speak of, of boundaries, a world that is so different, that world was so far removed from us.  We didn't have access to that world, and anyone they would bring in, they'd bring somebody in from New York [New York] or Chicago [Illinois], that could sing like Paul Robeson.  Or that had musical talent or could play sports, two, those two things, and I didn't fit any of them you know.  I wasn't known for sports or in fact sports went against me, I wasn't known for singing you know.
Speaker 1: Well you could run fast.
Speaker 2: I could run fast, but I, I only had two credit hours, so I wasn't included on the track team.  In fact I remember a time, it was an all school track event, I was and, and I came out on the field with my brother's [Laudell Jackson] track shoes that he had broken a record in.  And you, you know what I mean I was asked to leave.  That hurt me that hurt me like nothing else, very; it's a very bitter time of my life around that period.  Because I fought so hard to belong, to be accepted, I even cut a part in my hair couldn't comb it in you know.  Didn't, didn't work that way, (laughter) cut a part in my hair and wore glasses to look you know.
Speaker 1: More collegiate?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Isn't that sad, that's some sad shit you know, I meant a--
Speaker 1: Who were your friends?
Speaker 2: Didn't have any, you know me and Duane Livingston, you know who is now my brother in-law you know we were the only one's there.  Let, let's see me Duane and Ronnie Slaw [Ronald Slaw] you know and we were bounced around you know.
Speaker 1: Three, three black students in the school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm yeah, and now Duane, president of, vice president of Caterpillar tractor company [Caterpillar Inc.], you know, and you know I have tenure here [at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] and also the Lincoln Academy award [Laureate of the Lincoln Academy of Illinois].  So you know what I mean it's like you can never tell how things happen, and Ronnie is a very prominent citizen in Decatur, Illinois well-respected and, so it's dangerous, it's very dangerous to discriminate.
Speaker 1: Okay. You never know who you're keeping down.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 364929
Speaker 1: Now you, you stay, you stayed in Millikin [Millikin University, Decatur, Illinois] for, you said a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No my parents [Shirley Armstrong Jackson and T.J. Jackson, Sr.] lived in Decatur [Illinois], I stayed with them you know.
Speaker 1: No I mean you were at Millikin or--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You stayed with your parents when you, you were there about a year you said?
Speaker 2: Yeah a year--
Speaker 1: Going to night school?
Speaker 2: And then, I, I flunked out you know, I flunked one of my art courses.  Got no explanation, in fact many times I was the only one that would show up for class.  Have the largest paintings, canvasses, I'd stretched in the, so after leaving that situation, I had to bring my grade average up you know.  This little Irish woman she taught me grammar and taught me how to diagram you know and taught me literature.  And God she says, she says, "You're really good at this," I just didn't realize that I, I could do it you know.   And, and she brought my ability to a level where I petitioned, got back in, brought my grade average up to a 4.0.  Transferred out of there, went to Southern Illinois [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] and to, and right in the middle of--I'd never seen that many black people in one place from Chicago [Illinois].  I'd never seen that and it was, I was so damned proud and shocked, brothers wearing Big Apples [Big Apple cap] then you know.  Walt Frazier was there and, and some other guys you know, famous people.  And--
Speaker 1: Yeah Walt Frazier was a star of the basketball team then.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Won the NIT tournament [National Invitation Tournament] in '67 [1967] I think.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah.  I mean I'd walk to class with him you know, and the sisters were there carrying their bags on their hips like that.  And these huge beehive hairdos that were, Negro beehive hairdos, a little bit stiffer, and a little bit something else.  And bright lipstick on dark skin, I mean, I, I never seen anything so beautiful.  I started drawing them, I have the sketch books, and came home man it was a real culture shock.  And I 'cause I had married Melba [Melba Jackson] you know, Melba, Melba was the most beautiful woman you know.  But we were, we were very poor and--
Speaker 1: So you got married while you were at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --at Millikin?
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, and I left and to, to 'cause I wanted to provide a living for her you know what I mean?  And we had a baby and I wanted her to have the best, so I made a lot of sacrifices worked at Cav- Revere Copper and Brass [Revere Copper and Brass Inc.; Revere Copper Products, Inc.] in Decatur.  Making pots and pans and stuff, and worked at Caterpillar tractor company [Caterpillar Inc.] sweeping the floors, and all of that I did while going to school.  You know what I mean, night school, because I had to have this job.
Speaker 1: Okay so did you have to work when you went to Southern Illinois, I mean did you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you, did you save your money and just go to Southern (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no I didn't have money, I played jazz, I played music.
Speaker 1: So you got a music scholar- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: You earned money by playing--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Music. I see.
Speaker 2: Right, I mean I played country and western music in, in places like Cary, Illinois and, and Ya- heehaw countries, heehaw places that were very dangerous, very close to Cairo [Illinois].  And I had to play bass instrument, I wasn't that familiar with, but it was simple 'cause it's just one, two, one, two and really simple things, I didn't have to make chords.  So a lot of strange little gigs just to survive you know, you know, but I was determined.
Story_ID: 364930
Speaker 1: Now when you, when you were at Southern Illinois [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] was, was [HistoryMaker] Katherine Dunham involved at all with the school or?
Speaker 2: Katherine who?
Speaker 1: Dunham.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I heard that name, she was in St. Louis [Missouri].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And there was a SIU branch [Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, Edwardsville, Illinois], I don't know whether it was, but I remember St. Louis would always--kids would come from St. Louis.  I remember doing an album with a guy from St. Louis playing guitar for him, yeah.  Katherine Dunham's name, there was a group, a dance troupe--
Speaker 1: Dance, right.
Speaker 2: And they would come over to Carbondale [Illinois].
Speaker 1: It started, it seems strange that, that all the black people from Chicago [Illinois] we're talking about, leave Carbondale the opposite end of the state (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Exact opposite end of the state, most of the students were from Chicago.
Speaker 2: Yeah, culture shock for me, I mean brothers were big and strong and they wore long overcoats and things, and Big Apple hats.  And they talked a certain way, they spoke the words it was southern, but yet Chicago you know like Chicago jazz, it had that flavor.  And the dancing all of that stuff, it was definitely I mean I felt scared, it was overwhelming you know.  Because of that, that was so different and so beautiful at the same time.
Speaker 1: Now this is 19- what 1964?
Speaker 2: Yes this is getting into what '67 [1967] '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Oh '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: Yeah '66 [1966] you know my first intent was to go down there and go to a trade school and just do art because I didn't have the money to go, actually get into a university and so my friend Larry would tell me, you know he would drive down, I drive down with him.  He says, Larry Able [ph.] was his name. He says, "You can do it you know, a vocational school," so I went down there.  And I went out, outskirts of Carbondale and I saw this vocational school and it was barracks, I mean it looked like chickens lived in there you know.  And I said to myself this isn't for me, I became very discouraged, I was on my way home you know.  And you know my wife Melba [Melba Jackson] you know, she was really behind me and so was Larry Able, and I said, "Well I went to Millikin [Millikin University, Decatur, Illinois], well why not go there?"  I got in at Millikin so why can I, the hard way, so why not try to get into and I did, and made it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: So that was, I mean SIU [Southern Illinois University] or, or Millikin which one?
Speaker 2: SIU.
Speaker 1: SIU.
Speaker 2: I got into SIU.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause you said Millikin I (unclear) got confused for a minute (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.  Well yeah the comparison you know it was more difficult than Millikin.
Speaker 1: Was it?
Speaker 2: You know in a social sense so many things you know, you, you can allow the body in but the mind; you have to allow in also.  It was that separation you know physically I was there, but socially, psychologically that was the hard part.
Story_ID: 364931
Speaker 1: Now do you remember, I don't know if this, this conflict had started, I know it was going on, on some level, but I know in the late '60s [1960s] there's a tremendous amount of conflict in, in southern Illinois, is a Reverend Koen down there? James Koen (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Charles Koen?
Speaker 1: Charles Koen right.
Speaker 2: He was my friend.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah we grew up together you know although he was from southern Illinois and he came up to Decatur [Illinois] when I was in Millikin University [Decatur, Illinois].  We're very close friends you know, and he came from Cairo [Illinois] that's where he came from, and then he, he became very involved in the politics.  And some say, may say he went bad (laughter) that old saying you know he got into too much of himself.  And he was always fast you know, but in this particular case he was fast for the right reasons, you know.  And he believed in what he stood for.  I remember when the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] and CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] would trace, tracking him, he would stay at our house on University Avenue [Carbondale, Illinois] you know, where it was called the University Street House [ph.].  A bunch of us guys you know we lived there, we were heavily integrated household.  And so we would take care of him.
Speaker 1: Yeah I remember he ca-, he was touring universities with a film of the kind, of some of the struggles down in Cairo.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah. That's a long time ago (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was very active; I mean he was on television not too long ago maybe a few years back, five years here in Chicago [Illinois].  And I gave him a call you know.
Speaker 1: So that's, now that's interesting I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm glad I raised that.
Speaker 2: I'm glad you did too it's interesting how our paths recrossed you know?
Speaker 1: And did you know, I know Leon Thomas I think was from Cairo, I believe.
Speaker 2: The singer?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Lee, Leon Thomas wow, that's right.
Speaker 1: He's older than you I believe.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I remember him when he was, was with Basie [Count Basie], yes, after Joe Williams quit.  Leon, Leon Thomas moved right into that spot, he did that Twa, or Twa people, they're really, well we call them pygmies but they're Twa, that's the real name.  But he would yodel in his song.
Speaker 1: Is that where he got it?
Speaker 2: Huh? Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is that where he got the technique (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely yeah, he was something man.
Speaker 1: Pharoah Sanders back when in the--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-eight [1968], 'The Creator Has a Master Plan.'
Speaker 2: I know it.  God I always wanted to know more about him.
Speaker 1: Leon Top, Leon Topaless [ph.] I think his name was, Leon Topaless Thomas (laughter).
Speaker 2: I didn't know that, God what a connection, damn.
Story_ID: 364932
Speaker 1: Well you're playing your guitar.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And going to school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so Southern [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] was, did you, did you get in the groove at Southern?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, had my own group, I joined groups, some of our groups you know we had white members in the group.  And they respected the fact that some band jobs I didn't wanna go on and they respected that, and I, I thank them for that.  They were sundown towns and, but yeah I definitely played a lot of music with Big Twist and the Mellow Fellows, (laughter) they used to be here with the Alligator Records [Chicago, Illinois].  Well I moved out of, I left Carbondale [Illinois] the same time Big Twist [Larry Nolan] did, and we played in the same group a long time.  And I made records when I interviewed, or when I presented Dionne Warrick [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick] with one of the, The HistoryMakers' statues.  I told her, I said, "Do you remember a record label," Dionne Warrick and it, it was called, it wasn't (unclear), I can't think of the name of it.  But we were on the same label you know and it, it was an interesting label.  So yeah we did several records, not with her, with my own group, Preston Jackson and the Rhythm Aces.
Speaker 1: Preston Jackson and the Rhythm Aces?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Were you mostly jazz or?
Speaker 2: No we were rhythm and blues; we were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Rhythm and blues, okay.
Speaker 2: I mean you know we used to have battle of the bands with Ike [Ike Turner] and Tina Turner.  And, and Milton, Little Milton and--
Speaker 1: Little Milton right. You used to see his bust on Chicago [Illinois], in Chicago now and South Chicago, Little Milton.
Speaker 2: Little Milton, no kidding.
Speaker 1: Yeah 'cause if he's, I mean I did as late as last year there's a bust with his name on it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Wow, that's my history you know. Stanley Turrentine you know in the, in Rock Island [Illinois] we met him you know and his group.  We played opposite gigs and we took his crowd you know because we were playing rock and roll and stuff.  And he was playing very difficult music you know.
Speaker 1: I haven't asked, a question just to be curious but that part of the country, that area down by Cairo [Illinois] and Carbondale [Illinois] was referred to Mark Twain, by Mark Twain as Little Egypt.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Back in the day, the Mississippi River and Ohio [River] come together (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. That's right.
Speaker 1: Are there, are there musical traditions, I know that the back in the 19th century the showboat thing was a big deal.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And black entertainment in that area was--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Are there, did you think there are like remnants of the, the 19th century down there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh definitely, definitely, banjo playing and even the, the derogatory kinds of things like minstrelsy and all of that stuff.  Riverboat, I mean the river was so important, sounds on the river, the divide between the Illinois or the Miss- the Mississippi and the Ohio River.  All of that history I mean all of that has some connections to music.  A lot of people settled there, I met musicians that are grandsons of great musicians that were on the riverboat circuits you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very much alive you know until things begin to change and then 19 century Reconstruction and you know the emergence of the Klan, Klu Klux Klan [sic. Ku Klux Klan, KKK] from out of Indiana.  Things begin to change fast you know, people were shoved, pushed and frightened and they moved around, that's a lot.  A lot of that was at the basis of immigration of migration you know, fear, fear was a big part of that you know.
Story_ID: 364933
Speaker 1: Did you ever have a show, an art showing I mean a, a show at a gallery while you were an art student at SIU [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no only student shows you know, occasionally student shows.
Speaker 1: Were you primarily painting or sculpting?
Speaker 2: I was a painter; yeah I, I got my B.A. in painting and my M.F.A. in sculpture.   But no, no only school events you know and a lot of that still happens you know today, but many improvements you know.  I must admit a lot of improvements.
Speaker 1: Okay, now so you got your M-, B.A. in what year?
Speaker 2: Let's see, my, I was out of, I got my, my B.A. from Southern Illinois '70 [1970] oh wait a minute.  Around '70 [1970], right, right.
Speaker 1: Seventy [1970]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay. And did you--
Speaker 2: I could never really know these.
Speaker 1: Did you go right on for your, for your M.F.A.?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I went to my M-, I went for my--now Tony Zamora and a very beautiful man by the name of Dan Perrino [Daniel J. Perrino] somehow help me get a scholarship to the U of I [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois].  Tony Zamora and Dan Perrino and combined, well that was the day we, that, those were the days of affirmative action.  I just happened to be at the right time and the right place.  And through affirmative action, I was admitted as a graduate student in a very difficult school that had no blacks in their program at that time.
Speaker 1: This is the University of Illinois (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The U of I, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And that's Champaign [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Right Champaign uh-huh, we were the first you know, and I thought being the first, that whole idea being the first went out in the '40s [1940s] you know?  Well here I'm still dealing with that stuff you know, but yeah I, we were the first group of Negros.  Most of them from the South, from black schools [HBCUs] you know, I don't think they wanted any northern Negroes 'cause there, there was a difference.  There's something different, but they found out when they did get southern Negroes (laughter) they were hell to get along with.  Because I mean they knew what that stuff was about, and they should've selected (laughter), but no I'm just joking.  But it's fun, it's a funny turn of events the people that they didn't want, they got the strongest you know, they got the more determined.  Because a lot of the African American college people were more focused, they wanted it bad enough you know, yeah.
Story_ID: 364934
Speaker 1: Now when you, when you were in, at Southern [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] or I, I I'm not sure exactly sure on the time period, I think it was about 1968.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Here at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah I was down at Southern, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah but here in Chicago [Illinois], well in North- in Evanston [Illinois], [HistoryMaker] Jeff Donaldson tried to call together a lot of black artists for a big artist conference, I think it was '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: I wasn't aware of that.
Speaker 1: Called AfriCOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Were, were you part of that?
Speaker 2: No I wasn't a part of it, but I heard about it, yeah, yeah I heard about that.  In fact you know musicians would come from Chicago, you know older guys you know like Oscar Brown [HistoryMaker Oscar Brown, Jr.].  And Cohran.
Speaker 1: Phil Cohran [HistoryMaker Philip Cohran], yes sir.
Speaker 2: Phil Cohran, yeah man these guys used to come down and Don Lee you know.  His, his name is he has a Muslim name now.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Haki Madhubuti.
Speaker 2: Hak-, right, right. Those guys would come down and [HistoryMaker] Nikki Giovanni, boy we sit at their feet man and they'd teach us their stuff.  School happened outside of school, education was very important on the quads and in the homes of, of students.  That, that's when it all came about, great times.
Speaker 1: All right so, how, how were things at the University of Illinois [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], how, how did you like that?
Speaker 2: It, it was, it was great you know and I don't know I love it, I love it, I loved being there.  Carbondale [Illinois], I loved being in Carbondale, at, at the school, those were the best years of my life you know.  At SIU [Southern Illinois University] and, at Champaign-Urbana and then here in Chicago at SAIC [School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] you know?
Speaker 1: Now did you have a, were there any particular teachers or mentors at S, SIU or, or University of Illinois?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah, you know there was Mr. Breland [Bruce Breland], and there's Mr. Bernstein [Larry Bernstein], there was Mr. Sullivan [ph.], and you know we refer to him as Mr. you know?  Oh man you know, I mean all that, that terrible stuff that was going on and these guys stood out, these guys were good people.  Really good people, hell Mr. Breland, he knew more about bigotry that we would ever know, and he took us out to Hampton U [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], home on the Atlantic [Atlantic Ocean] at Hampton University in Virginia.  And we played a jazz concert and he read you know Langston Hughes 'Ask Your Mama' ['Ask Your Mama: Twelve Moods for Jazz'] but God he, he taught us a lot, yeah.  Think sometimes people forget to, to talk about things like that, strong positive things that happened.  My best times, I know I, I say that before in Carbon and places, but even now, I'm, I'm experiencing those high moments you know?  Especially here with my students, I mean you don't se-, you notice how helpful they were.  They wanted to do this entire room for you guys you know, but these are, these are good times.
Story_ID: 364935
Speaker 1: Now when you were a student you know what direction was your artwork taking, I mean what was, what influenced your artwork, and what direction did it take (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Politics, always politics, I, I never afforded the luxury of dealing with landscapes and conceptual and, and art that people did simply because they were interested in machinery or interested in something that reminded them of their girlfriends or something. I never could afford the luxury of that because so much happened, especially in the year of 1968.  There's no way I could've been painting about other stuff, because I had to be, they had curfews you know, and--
Speaker 1: Were there riots in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, National Guards for the, both schools, the U of I [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] and Carbondale [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois], I had to go to class you know walking down lines.  In front of lines of National Guardsmen with their guns you know and their bayonets and, and I, you know I had a baby you know, Natalie [Natalie Jackson].  And later on we had another baby Alice [Alice Jackson] and I was in an area, I mean traveling with a band and stuff in raggedy big fat cars you know with Big Twist [Larry Nolan] (laughter).  Cars, cars that could barely make it to Cairo [Illinois] and back and why didn't I fear all that stuff like I should had, I don't know.  I mean you know I lived in Cambria, Illinois you know rat infested trailer and with signs shoved under our door.  Telling me and my buddy from Boston [Massachusetts] you know who had a Bostonian accent, white dude telling us to get out of town and stuff.  Didn't really, I don't know man I just know that those were times, the fear just, it strikes me now.  What the hell was I thinking you know?
Speaker 1: So, so when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed there was a riot in, in--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: At SIU [Southern Illinois University]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: On the campus or in the community?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in our house, in our integrated house it was so sad man, I mean you know we had these dudes from all over.   We had, you, we looked like the United Nations [UN], no one said anything you know, everyone just came downstairs and sat in front of the fireplace.  Almost like a moment of silence without anyone saying anything you know?  My roommate you know from Boston, John [ph.], my other roommate, Charlie [ph.] from Cam- Cambodia you know and really beautiful cats man.  We just came down, we sat by the fire and then we all got up and left, went back to our rooms you know.
Speaker 1: So did you, did you paint about Dr. King?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, I did this piece, it's still in Decatur [Illinois] somewhere, but I, I cast this bronze down there you know.  Warrior like, eagle like scene you know with writing on it, the day he was killed, but that piece is in existence you know?  Did it the day he was killed, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Were you affected as much by the death of Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy]?
Speaker 2: Okay, I'll, I'll admit, I had a slight breakdown, emotional breakdown because my sister [Alice Yvonne Jackson Joyner] died, the one I talked about, you know had the beautiful profile?  She died that year and I think Alice was born and we were living on five dollars a week.  And I was driving a, a Nash [Nash Motors Company] that radiator blew up in my face and I had to drive all the way through the sundown towns because I wasn't allowed.  I did go to Vandalia [Illinois] to get some help, 'cause my nose was coming off, the skin on my nose.  And he gave me some salve and stuff and said, "Yeah well we can't hold you in here so we can't," and I was dizzy.  So all of that shit was going on in that period of time in that year, and I was growing pot [marijuana] in the backyard.  And the police knew it you know they joke and come by and how's your crop and all this stuff, and but I couldn't make any money 'cause I didn't smoke the stuff you know.  And then it was getting to the place where it wasn't fun anymore because you could get arrested for it, but all of that stuff was going on at the same time you know.  And so I, I had a little breakdown you know, and that was it you know, and my buddy you know John, he br-, he, he offered to buy me a ticket, a plane ticket.  And pay all the expenses you know, rich white dude you know, but we were like brothers.  And I had to say, "No John you know, I, I gotta get through this you know, 'cause I'm a man you know."  And Charlie, you know this other dude, young white dude we used to call him Rat [ph.] and we took care of him like a little brother.  He was the youngest guy in the, in the big house and he was shipped to Vietnam, we never heard from him anymore.  And I became A-1 again and so I was worried about flunking out of school and getting drafted you know.  So all of that, all of that pressure made me snap you know.
Story_ID: 417370
Speaker 1: You were discussing you had a sort of a breakdown at SIU [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] before you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's before you went over to, before you went to the University of Illinois [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, uh-huh, and I think you know like I said before you know the pressures, just many pressures.
Speaker 1: But you managed to graduate and then?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, I managed to graduate with honors you know and you know my wife Melba [Melba Jackson] she came down to my celebration.  She had to take the bus, which she really didn't like because it's like five or six hours going through all of those sundown cities you know.
Speaker 1: Where was she living at the time?
Speaker 2: She was in Decatur, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Decatur okay.
Speaker 2: Right she was working, she was also a student at Millikin University [Decatur, Illinois] and later, but anyway, she did come down for my graduation which was cool.  And we got ourself a little motel and I mean those were cool things you know, really great memories you know.  I can see it all so clear, I had a Volkswagen and I took the cover off the engine, took the fenders off to make it faster and trying to light--and the way that, she, she's been with me all this time and I would do to our cars, my family cars (laughter).  Well I don't do that anymore, my father [T.J. Jackson, Sr.] used to get pissed off, he would say, "Bubby," you know that was one of my nicknames, "why do you mess up these cars?" (Laughter) Wow.
Speaker 1: A true artist.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so there's a lot of humor with bad times and that's why a lot of people get through it you know, you laugh to keep from crying.
Story_ID: 417371
Speaker 1: So at University of Illinois [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], now what did, how did the working on a M.F.A. change your, your art, artwork or did it?
Speaker 2: Well mainly I was admitted into program, that was a big step, I was admitted into the program.  And, and those are very strong revolutionary times you know, we wore dashikis and all that stuff you know.  You know I had friends from all over the world you know; Tony Zamora played a very big part.  He was a tenor sax player you know.  And he hired me as a guitar player for his band to play jazz only and difficult jazz, very difficult music, big turning point in my life.  And Dan Perrino [Daniel J. Perrino], Dan was like a blessing, he was like a godfather you know and all the wonderful people I, I met in, in Champaign [Illinois]. Frank Gallo the artist, very famous artist at that time, people like that. Hugh Hefner landing in Champaign with his big airplane, jet plane painted black with a bunny on it.  And well I rode, I had a motorcycle then, heavily into cars at that time only you know to pictures and things.  Watching guys work on them, but my main mode of transportation around town was a motorcycle.  And, but all of that was going on, cultural events, poetry, African American cultural events were so plentiful, every weekend, every week something like that was going on.  Very proud people and heavily integrated you know and because people, young people wanted to know you know.  We, I remember there's a time we took over a building, Linc- Lincoln Hall [Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], well I don't, I don't wanna get into that because some, something bad happened along with that.  But anyway we were very bold about things.
Speaker 1: Now was, was Val Ward [HistoryMaker Val Gray Ward] on campus then, I know at one time she was.
Speaker 2: Val?
Speaker 1: Val Gray Ward, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, Val Gray.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: How are you coming up with these names, I mean you're from Ohio (laughter) or something.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) seven hundred people, that's how (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh wow, Val.
Speaker 1: I mean, I, I used to be in Kuumba Theatre [Chicago, Illinois] and Val used to talk about her time at the University of Illinois and black studies department and all that.
Speaker 2: Wow, you're making some great connections.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah the African house, you know the African American Center [Bruce D. Nesbitt African American Cultural Center, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] that she was a part of, she was one of the directors.  But that, all of that can you imagine what it was like being young (laughter) and a student at that time in school?  And competing and taking life very serious and doing a lot of positive things, it wasn't that crime, it wasn't so much crime.  But we had it, the word gangs you know, but we were, we were black people so we included the townies.  The people that lived in town, they had the wisdom, they were revered and there was no separation, so those were great times.
Story_ID: 417372
Speaker 1: So you, you began to concentrate on sculpting at University of Illinois [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Why did you switch (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Switch at that time?
Speaker 1: --focus, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well actually it happened at Southern [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] during my very last semester, we had a visiting artist.  And he started taking these balloons and taking molds from them and reproducing them in wax you know.  And wow, I said what a great method and, so I developed that tech-, I took that technique and I developed it you know.  And I'm still developing it today, but I saw the work of Peter Fagan, I saw the work of Frank Gallo especially.  I think Frank Gallo influenced Peter Fagan you know, but resin the tranluce- translucency of, of materials, expressing the three dimensional form.  I, I guess I wanted to say more and say it more emphatically, and that drew me to sculpture, simply because of that third dimension you know of looking at art.  Being able to move it around, to look behind it, and to, and to speak you know in a, in abstract terms at the same time you know with that work.  And I guess that's what really what pulled me into sculpture.  Actually like I tell my students today I really don't see any difference except the materials you know.  Same concepts, same ideas, same, many times, same materials, especially if you doing flat work.  It's a relief combination between three dimensional, two dimensional which turns out to be a relief.  And that's where Peter Fagan was quite, quite and influence, and then, and then when Frank Gallo started doing these cast paper pieces, I was hooked you know.  I mean it was there, you know at Millikin [Millikin University, Decatur, Illinois] it was strictly painting you know.  Definitely painting techniques that I had learned from Marvin Klaven you know from the Iowa school of painting.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when did you get your M.F.A. from?
Speaker 2: I got my M.F.A. in '70 [1970], '71 [1971] or early '72 [1972] yeah, well '71 [1971] because I went back to Millikin University to teach.  I was a substitute for Marvin Klaver, Klaven, who had gone on a sabbatical; he had left for England and on sabbatical. He recommended that I teach sculpture in his place.
Speaker 1: Marvin Klaven you spell his last name C-L-A (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No it's K-L-A--
Speaker 1: K-L-A.
Speaker 2: V-E-N.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: Marvin Klaven.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Marvin did, Marvin did some wonderful things for me, I know that he was under pressure, I feel being Jewish.  And at times, I can just sense you know the pressure he was under, but he taught me how to paint.  He respected my paintings, and he taught me a lot of things about painting.  There was a moment where we didn't; I couldn't understand some of the things about my grading you know. I, I don't understand, I didn't get a good explanation you know, so those were rather dull, dark moments between our relationship.  But the things that he did do for me outweighs that you know the fact that he started me off on my teaching profession. By finding me a job and recommending me as a professor for Western Illinois University in Macomb [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Oh Western Illinois, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah that was my first job as a, a professor, this was after graduate school you know, and Marvin was very instrumental in bringing that about.
Story_ID: 417373
Speaker 1: Western Ill- [Western Illinois University, Macomb, Illinois], how, how did you like Western or (unclear) Western?
Speaker 2: Macomb [Illinois] that's one of those places to even today I love Macomb and Macomb loves me, I'm sure, you know.  I'm still very much connected to Macomb.  Whenever I have an exhibit here in Chicago [Illinois], my friends in Macomb show up, I mean it's an everlasting love affair.  It's like a marriage, you know, my hearts still, is still there, as well as in Carbondale [Illinois] and, and Champaign [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember, I just wanna throw this out here, I, there's a fella I used to know who's there that taught named Dave Patterson, you, you remember him?  He was involved in black studies at--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: He had a lot of students he'd bring to Chicago every summer.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think they're a part of that--
Speaker 2: I know that name.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  I think he's, at one time he worked for IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] in, he knew a lot about IBM.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah I know that name.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But yeah so Macomb, Illinois, all right that's what, all right, yeah--
Speaker 2: That's in western Illinois.
Speaker 1: Yes, right, right.  So how long did you teach at Western?
Speaker 2: I, I taught there thirteen years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know that's where I stayed, that was a place, I, I came here in '89 [1989] to Chicago at SAIC [School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], and one of the faculty members, Frances Whitehead, you know she helped me get in here and you know.  I mean there were other people that you know that help me of course you know there's [HistoryMaker] Isobel Neal you know and of course [HistoryMaker] Richard Hunt. So I think those three people I owe my coming to Chicago to.
Speaker 1: Okay so you came here in '89 [1989] you said?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Story_ID: 417374
Speaker 1: Let me go back and now when did you first launch your own exhibit you know as a professional?
Speaker 2: Professionally?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well I, I can't really recall because you know it happened so nonchalantly, I mean you're looking you're, look your studio and there's work there.  It's gotta be seen you know, I can say that it happened at an art fair in Decatur, Illinois, at Decatur's annual art fair [Arts in Central Park].  I think that would be a good place to, to start or to say my professional or career started then. Then and there.
Speaker 1: These would be like prior to, well what about when, what time period we talking about?
Speaker 2: Oh Decatur, Illinois, this was right out of high school [Stephen Decatur High School, Decatur, Illinois], this is during high school.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And at the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] in Decatur, Illinois, my sister Yvonne, Alice Yvonne [Alice Yvonne Jackson Joyner] helped me to get a show at the YMCA, YWCA.  And for me a kid at that age, you know that was a big thing you know in high school, to see my work and for someone to--it's like a recital.
Story_ID: 417375
Speaker 1: I wanna ask you this first then maybe you can give us a chron-, some, some kind of chronologically or some of the highlights of your career.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But what is your philosophy of art, I mean what is your own personal philosophy of art, and what are you trying to do with your work?
Speaker 2: With my work?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: I'm trying to tell a story about a culture, a culture that was able to survive, many forms of, of persecution you know.  I mean that's a heavy, that's a deep word, but it is, it's a form of persecution, it goes all the way back to the Jews you know.  And, and Egypt it goes all the way back to you know the Irish, it goes, you know the treatment of people because of their religious beliefs or, or their origins.  Think of how much we lose from that, you know nothing is gained from it, think of how people that are, are on the receiving end of that feel.  As a culture you know, no matter what they do simply because, something as simple as color or a belief can create genocide. That's how serious it is you know, and I can understand maybe, well I don't, I don't think of it as a nice thing. I can see it happening in certain cultures such as you know ancient cultures.  Mayan and, and Incas and, and religious you know in Rome places like that, but as time goes on seem like we would have learned something you know?  That you can't wipe a whole group of people off the map, thousands and thousands, simply because of their belief-, their beliefs.  So it has always been something on my mind, I used to have nightmares; I'd wake up in cold sweats.  I remember reading stories of, on how Jews hid during the Nazi, you know the Kristallnacht an example during that period.  Or the book burnings and, and just how they were treated in the streets and so I lived that in my imagination.  It was a terrible thing crossing over here in ships in the hull of ships you know, lying side by side they call it tight packing you know.  How that would have, how that would have felt if that were me or family members. So you know all there's, you can't avoid it, and this is what I--to answer to your question, this is what brought me into art. This is what fascinated me about you know that ability to communicate 'cause my writing was always terrible (laughter).  And my speaking, I was so shy, I would never get up to recite, I'd never stand up and recite. I would always hide behind you know people when (laughter) I was called upon or, thought I was gonna be called upon.  So art, making images, starting a little newspaper when I was in junior high, drawings with little words and passing them around.  And that was my, I was kind of a bully too doing that, that was not good, I hurt a lot of people doing that.
Speaker 1: Are they sort of, sort of lampooned some of the people and the--
Speaker 2: Yes exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was my voice, that was my weapon, because I had, imagine I, imagine that I had so much that wasn't going for me you know.  I mean I couldn't play basketball, I ran so fast, I forgot to shoot the ball, 'cause I was underneath the thing you know.  And my gym shorts were so raggedy you know it's like, and I was so short you know. I mean it's like so much and that most of that I, I'll say again was all your imagination; it was a complex you know. But to overcome that, I could draw you know, and I used that in not so nice a way you know, and so like that.
Speaker 1: Kind of like it, it was an adolescent weapon against other--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Adolescents you know sim-, similar things.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Shame, shame.
Speaker 1: But you said you're, you're art has always had a message then you're saying?
Speaker 2: Oh definitely.
Speaker 1: You're always; you're always trying to deliver a message.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To communicate, you it's, it was just, you know as soon as I became aware of politics you know, even as a child you know.  I would hear names you know, names that stuck in my mind as a child was MacArthur [Douglas MacArthur] you know Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] and names that de, even the name Stalin [Joseph Stalin].  And Fidel Castro you know you would hear these names, words, they were just words but ex-, but they had meaning.  They were people that spoke out for other people; I think I started reading John L. Sullivan [sic. John L. Lewis], who was he?  Who are these labor people you know I became very interested in things.  This was later that I read about 1936 you know the, the strike at GM [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] and also the Haymarket situation here in Chicago [Illinois].  But, but did it mean to be an anarchist, but it didn't mean to be a socialist, why was I attracted to these things?  Later in college [Millikin University, Decatur, Illinois] I joined a group called YAWF, Youth Against War and Fascism.  And we came up here for the 1968 Democratic Convention [1968 Democratic National Convention, Chicago, Illinois], and so art, you know it's a good thing that I was an artist.  I think I could've gone in another direction, and probably end up spending some time behind bars.
Story_ID: 417376
Speaker 1: Well can you describe some of the highlights in your career and some of the pieces you've cre- created and you know give us some stories behind some of those pieces.  I know we don't have them in front of us but, if you can just give us a brief kind, and we will show some at one point (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I hope so right. Well the highest light, the brightest light would be what I'm doing now, 'Fresh from Julieanne's Garden,' you know.
Speaker 1: Now Julieanne was one of your relatives?
Speaker 2: Yeah my great-great grandmother you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Julie, 'Fresh from Julieanne's Garden,' this, I had an exhibit at the Cultural Center [Chicago Cultural Center] here in Chicago [Illinois] and now the exhibit is traveling, the pieces are traveling.  It was a very successful show in many ways, one is that I got my point across, two I was able to tell my history, our history. And three, it you know, I, I started getting some pretty lucrative commissions from that, from that showing you know. So you know this is, this is the height, these are high times in my career, in the, I see future things. I feel very positive about future things happening you know, only thing that I'm very pessimistic about is pessimistic about is the fact that we always seem to find ourselves in wars. We, I mean if one war situation is over, we'll find another one you know, and I'm not saying we, but it happens all over the world. Some kind of conflict happens when our young people have to go off and get their bodies torn to pieces you know. So I do have this thing in the back of my mind if these situations aren't positive, then my life isn't you know. I mean I, I can't be fully happy or comfortable when those things are going on you know. Crime situation you know, and the direction parts of pop culture has turned you know and, and the results of it.
Story_ID: 417377
Speaker 1: Well let me talk about two pieces that I know about and maybe you can kind of explain what you were, how you came up with it.  One piece is The HistoryMakers' award piece, the sculpture of a, a figure that, was been described as representing history standing on, on a ship.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you describe what you were trying to do with that and--
Speaker 2: Sure. Sure. Well I chose the female figure for that and because you know I, I look at, you know the female as a very important part, the essential part of our existence. And our ability to, to remain you know where we are and how we got there, the fact that she is in that upright position with the book in her hand. And reading the history, and also the fact that she's on this ship speaking of that, the crossing the great crossing from Africa to here. And how we endured you know, how we survived that. That, that was a great piece of sculpture, but the one that I or the sculptures that I'm doing now, 'Julieanne's Garden' ['Fresh from Julieanne's Garden'] and the one that I did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, now the, now I just wanna point out that, that--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --sculpture is in the hands of so many people who have made a significant contribution to the black community all over the country.  Becau-, in the form of the award that The HistoryMakers gives out every, you know to the people who have been interviewed.  And so it's all over the country now, you know, it's a, it's a one, that piece that you just described that award.
Speaker 2: Could we stop?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Excuse me for a moment, one of my students came in to rearrange her sculpture so, now, now we can move on.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So I'm just pointing out that, that little statuette, that sculpture that you know cast in, it's cast in bronze isn't it?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Cast in bronze?
Speaker 1: That's bronze.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Silicon bronze.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah there's now, there are hundreds of people with that now in their homes (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh good.
Speaker 2: And so, is you know people like it, I mean they like it, it represents what The HistoryMakers is trying, is trying to do.  There's another piece you sculptured a rather large statue of Irv Kupcinet, that's now on the correct?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And tell us how did that commission come about?
Speaker 1: Well that commission actually came about through you know a good, a good friend of mine, well, Jerry, Jerry Kupcinet you know who chose me.  And was determined to, to have me do this, and, and other, other Lois Weisberg and other people who said, "Well there's no need to do a search.  We know who our father, Irv would like to have do this," and so Jerry got in touch with me and although he did receive letters and email from people saying, "I don't think Jackson [HistoryMaker Preston Jackson] is the right person, I have the artist for you."  And he did not pay any attention to that, I'm por-, I'm very happy they didn't but just goes to show you, you know the political side of the art world.  But I was chosen to do it and I was very honored.
Speaker 2: Who commissioned, who commissioned the work, was it the city (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Jerry himself.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Jerry Kupicent and--
Speaker 2: Who is, who is, who is he, he's?
Speaker 1: That's his son.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Right Jerry Kupicent and the Chicago Sun-Times.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Of course Irv was--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Entertainment writer for the Chicago Sun-Times.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Wrote about what's going on around town and that sort of thing for many, many years.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Irv was quite a man; I mean you know his name will live on a long time here in Chic-, in the City of Chicago [Illinois].  I knew of him you know in the '60s [1960s] in the '70s [1970s] in the '80s [1980s] you know.  I watched 'Kup's Corner' ['The Irv Kupcinet Show'] which was his program, his television program, I watched that many times.  I admired him because he would always bring people on that no one else would select on their programs you know.  Interviews you know like Malcolm X you know, Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] and Irv welcomed these people.  And Jesse admired Irv, he, he said some very kind things to him, about him, so and that's why I, I was honored, quite honored to be a part of this project.
Story_ID: 417378
Speaker 1: There's a piece right over your left shoulder, which you might wanna describe to us, maybe we can zoom in on it.  And since it is right here in 3D and maybe you can describe this for us, it's right, there that one right there.
Speaker 2: Oh. Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes, see?
Speaker 2: The dancing couple?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well this is one that I'm working on just before you came, you came in and this particular piece is maybe a day old, it's not finished.  It takes me maybe two or three days to complete these, but it will be cast in bronze.  You're looking at the wax pattern and actually it's called, 'A Masquerade' [ph.], they're performing a death dance I, I call it.  At a masquerade party and a placees is a young lady that is brought into a practice called placage and they are owned, purchased by these men from you know the family or just purchased period. It's a form of slavery also and at the age of twelve, so these men owned them, they grew up very beautiful young ladies. And they're kept in a, in their own little house away from the family of the owner, their owners. And they're taken care of like a, a prized horse or something you know, but they attend an annual gathering called the maroon ball [sic. quadroon ball]. And these men parade their purchases, they, they parade them around, they dance and they walk with them you know. And it's a way to show off you know, just like an automobile buyer would buy a fancy car, and take it to a rally or something.
Speaker 1: This is a custom out of Louisiana or?
Speaker 2: Louisiana and South Carolina.
Speaker 1: South Carolina.
Speaker 2: Right, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But you know this is the piece (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) From the, from the, from back in the 19th century I guess?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: For the most part.
Speaker 2: The antebellum South, but anyway this particular piece you know they're wearing mask and you can't see it in this piece it's something that I'm, I'm working on later. He will have a skull, a mask on, a skeleton mask, and what we fail to see is that his hands are also skeleton like. The foot is also from another source, another place, so kind of a surreal like animal. But beneath his clothing and the covering there is this particular type of animal you know you're not sure whether it's a mask or not. Maybe we see a faint line separating the face from the mask; same thing goes for the female figure. We're not, we're not sure whether she's wearing a mask, she has this beautiful African face you know. But there are some markings on her face and the question we ask ourselves is it the edge of the mask or is it tribal marks or what?
Story_ID: 364945
Speaker 1: Okay, sir I wanted to ask you about the state of, I guess the marketplace now in terms of black sculptures, artists and I know there's a tremendous amount of money sometimes in public art.  With public laws on, on the federal, state and local level where a percent of the capital development budget is supposed to go for artworks.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So very few of our artists know about these even now or, or take advantage of like, we were discussing off camera that [HistoryMaker] Richard Hunt--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --great black sculptor gets quite a few commissions but there's a tendency just give them all to him you know and or--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now on the national, [HistoryMaker] Ed Dwight seems to get a lot of them but do, do you are things getting better or in that regard?
Speaker 2: Yeah I think things are, are getting better, you know I mean it's so obvious these games that have been played, are played. And have been for so long, it just amazes me why they haven't been addressed before you know, but things are getting better you know. Richard gets commissions often because he's good I mean with him it's not a race situation, his work is good, very interesting. I can't say the same for so many others but I could say that it, it is drawing some attention and it's being addressed. I think there's a turnover and that's why, all of the old school, all of the people who have been in positions to select and, and chose they're now dying off or either leaving. And there are younger people coming on committees that are aware of this problem. And that's why you know Elizabeth Kelley is one you know here in the City of Chicago [Illinois], she recognizes that something must be done. And something is being done and she's helping to bring it about. So there are other you know Greg Knight, there are other people, these are people that I know you know. That, there's Michael Dunbar, there's people that are aware that we should be more inclusive and they work hard to do it. So I, I am happy to say that things are better, I don't wanna forget Paul Klein who is also one of these heavy dealers in the art scene here in Chicago. He's very instrumental in bringing on the idea of inclusiveness bring, bringing on the idea of including others you know.
Speaker 1: Now have you been a part of some of the black artist coalitions some of them are not-for-profit, some are for-profit. I know in Chicago we had the Artists Roundtable I think--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --some other for-, formations where, have you been a part of these kind of efforts yourself?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I'm sorry to say I haven't you know, I'm so busy you know working you know in my studio and coming. But recently maybe as recent as maybe five years ago, you know there's young artist by the, people like Faheem [Faheem Majeed] and Joyce Owens [HistoryMaker Joyce Owens Anderson], and, and oh young Thomas Lucas you know and they are parts of organizations. And this is my way in so I was able to participate in shows and you know then we had Patrick Diamond and also the other Patric [HistroyMaker Patric McCoy] who is a collector. There's a group of African American collectors that are forming very powerful groups now that are doing a lot, doing a lot you know. As far as making it known that there are other African American artist in this city that deserve commissions.
Speaker 1: What about the gallery scene in, in the black community, what, what's it like for black artists, in the City of Chicago in terms of the mainstream white galleries and the black galleries.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Well coming here in '89 [1989] but always being in sort on the outer fringes of the art scene here in Chicago, I, I met [HistoryMaker] Isobel Neal. Who is a pioneer in gallery activity here in Chicago for African Americans and definitely you know, I mean I, I've known of no others that even come close to her. And that's my personal feelings, there are others you know, but still you know, she, she's the one, she knows her craft.
Story_ID: 364946
Speaker 1: Do you exhibit much here in the Chicago [Illinois] area in terms of, I know you just, you had a major exhibit at the Chicago Cultural Center [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Which is a city facility and it received raised, raved reviews I mean people were talking about it today at lunch (laughter).
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: We were talking about today at lunch.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, but do you, are you trying, is that show touring now or what's, what's going on?
Speaker 2: The show is touring but it's touring in Chicago and outside of Chicago.  I sort of built my reputation in areas, other states and other places in the, in the State of Illinois. And I, you know there was, there's a reason for that, I, I had to seek places other than in the City of Chicago, but all of that has changed. And I'm sorry that it happened, but I'm very lucky to have acquired people who respect what I'm doing, and not afraid. You know a lot of businesses such as galleries are so money driven that in some cases you know they have to stay open. But to discriminate is a bad thing, I don't care and I, I received a lot of that, I mean an awful lot of it. But again and I don't want to sound like I'm saying oh, but now everything you know, it's still there you know. But I'm very fortunate that we have people, like the people that I mentioned it, that are, are including artist like myself. Not as a token but artist that can produce the work you know, and also including other artist, young artist. Like some of my students for instance, you know Garland Taylor [Garland Martin Taylor] and, and Thoraine [ph.] and, young Tom Lucas [Thomas Lucas] and, and Niam [ph.] people like that you know.  There, you're hearing their names you know Bernard Williams, you're hearing their names more often than ever.  You're seeing their work; I'm very excited about this, these times. The piece that I'm doing for the McCormick Place here in Chicago, the one that I did downtown on Wacker [Drive]. Another that I'm doing at 6-, 69th Street, the statue I did of Fred Hampton you know, Marie Wilkinson, Daniel Hale Williams, these are all Chicago commissions you know. I'm turning down commissions now, I don't have the room or the time to, to complete so many you know, I'm too busy. I'm very excited about the now Chicago.
Speaker 1: So there's room for other artist to, to step up and, and take some of this?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, and--
Speaker 1: Public art commission.
Speaker 2: Oh definitely.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And they are you know there's John Mason he's, he's beginning to, to bag commissions you know, the you know the sore spot I, about this is that damn why did it take so long? I mean, but what's happening is that there's a turnover, there's a big turnover. The good old boys who, who ran the Navy Pier [Chicago, Illinois] shows, they're gone, they're leaving you know, that were a part of it. Not just who ran it, but these guys that you know that were a part of it, you know they're being swept by the wayside and there are new people that are concerned. More women are given opportunities to participate, more minorities, Hispanics, you know, Asians, African Americans, it's like a door has opened. And, and all of that talent is just flooding through.
Speaker 1: Okay, you came to Chicago full-time in '88 [1988] or '89 [1989]?
Speaker 2: Eighty-nine [1989].
Speaker 1: Eighty-nine [1989], okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So you weren't here prior to the Harold Washington administration in some, well--
Speaker 2: Yeah I was--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I was, I was coming in--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Almost at the same time I was coming in, it was still the talk of the school [School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Like during the, so is the, has the city played a consistent role in opening up op, opportunities for artist in?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, the culture, the City of Chicago with its programs you know connected to the other programs, yeah, they're, they're aggressively getting rid of that problem.
Story_ID: 364947
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this for, for young artists today, are there, are there, what are their, a lot of artist think.  Well if I'm an artist why do I need an M.F.A. or why do I need to go to school, you know can I make it you know just by producing good art and, I mean is it, is it possible for, for a young artist to, I mean what, what are the prospect if they don't go to school?
Speaker 2: Artist in general (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, even--
Speaker 2: --no particular race?
Speaker 1: Well either, yeah you can address either one (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well for many art students, it's a difficult; you know I've heard many times when a young kid would tell their parents, "I wanna be an artist," you know. I think that maybe eight out of ten times you know their head, oh now why this profession you know. Because there's that stigma you know starving young artist, and starving artist and all of those things attached to it.  And we do witness and see the things, trials and tribulations that artist have to go through. But you know they've always been around, artist has, art itself has always been a part of the human experience. Artist who makes the art will always be even in rough times, tough times, the WPA [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration] period there were artist you know. During war, war correspondence, people that record wars, not, in words but also in representational imagery and art. So it's something that I guess, it's not like betting on the bank, a job that involves another kind of, of task. The idea of art is with us and has been as long as people been on this earth you know, even cave painting art. To accept the beautiful stone that's well-crafted or an arrowhead or spear or something, I'm sure. In, in fact it was a form of currency that is and, and was in many societies so, art has always been, always will be. No matter how tough times are, and as you know, there's the extreme, there's the extreme prices from a billion dollars for a single art piece, to maybe twenty-five cents for a pin, unpredictable, crazy.
Speaker 1: Okay. But are your chances better if you've finished school or just strike out and do art?
Speaker 2: Well look at Bill Taylor [sic. Bill Traylor], you know so-called primitive artist, I don't like that term, but Bill Taylor's art, no schooling you know.  We, we attach words like outsider or self-taught.
Speaker 1: Naive.
Speaker 2: Yeah naive all of that stuff, that stuff's gonna disappear, thank God you know, it is, it's beginning to already. But Bill Taylor [sic.], people like that Mr. Imagination, you know, we won't grab these guys simply because they're black and they, they do these strange ritual kinds of, and we advertise--no, no, we don't advertise, but whenever we write about them, this is what we say about them. That seems to come first, we are now looking at the work, you know we're actually really paying attention to it. You know it's like blues, how can you discard the blues and throw it out, blues music you know. The characters and people that are involved in the blues they're black and they are, and I'm talking about old guys that I've seen and they're nasty and, they'll cut you with their razor, they're dangerous. And they're religious and they are afraid and they are brave and they build railroads you know, so I mean look at, look at all of that.
Story_ID: 364948
Speaker 1: Do you have one big project that you're envisioning right now that you just can't wait to, to get started on that you, that you know if you, if you had the decks cleared and you, that you would really do?
Speaker 2: Well right now I cleared my decks you know for the McCormick Place piece ['Bronzeville'], you know the piece under Paul Klein, I, I cleared my plate.  That's first and foremost and you know I was dealing with 'Bronzeville' you know, I did this hundred and twenty-five foot long piece that's been traveling. And you may have not heard of it, part of it is still here in Chicago [Illinois] over on 35th [Street] and Martin Luther King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive]. And half of it is in the City of Springfield [Illinois], but I dealt with 'Bronzeville' for a long time, and now I have the opportunity to do a piece about Bronzeville [Chicago, Illinois] and get paid you know. The first piece ['Bronzeville to Harlem'] you know that I did five hundred small figures and buildings and cast bronze cars and it's been traveling a long time, for about twelve years or so, but now I am doing one that's permanent at McCormick Place building, so when you walk into the place, you know, you'll look up and there's this huge stainless steel and bronze and aluminum and regular steel story in picture form of Bronzeville. And the Black Belt which it was called before it was called Bronzeville.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: I, I hate crime; now all cultures, I don't care whether you're black or white you gonna deal with crime you know. In, in fact a lot of that stuff stems from a lot of the type of crime that we see in the movies where we glorify people like Al Capone and, and that period. But in the black community we don't need this stuff, there are so many things that, that it spins off from. It, words, lyrics and songs, the way we look at and address our women you know, the B word the N word, robbing people on the streets. And being weak to drugs, something that comes from other parts of the world, very rich countries, somehow we end up holding the drugs. What is that all about you know, so these are things that I hate about society, these are things that I fight. These are things that make me very upset, but there's always dualities, there's always a balance somewhere. The fact that I have a, a new grandchild you know that looks like all of the Jacksons you know many years ago. What else, my students here at SAIC [School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] I have wonderful students. This makes me very happy you know my daughters [Natalie Jackson and Alice Jackson] you know, I have a beautiful wife [Melba Jackson], you know, I satisfy my habits (laughter) such as automobiles you know. Just the other day I went out and tuned or corrected a carburetor problem something as simple as that, in a 1934 Auburn you know, and I'm saying damn I hear this like I hear music; I touch the engine you know, in safe places (laughter) where it's not hot, but I search for the vibration, and if I turn the screw it stops you know. Those things make me happy, they feel good.

Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would differently now?
Speaker 2: I would take history courses, I would get serious about history and biology, zoology, I would, that's what I would do. And I would take up a language, I wanna learn to speak Korean I want to learn to speak Spanish, I think the Spanish culture you know the Latin culture you know has soul you know. Like what we used to refer to as soul like African American soul. I would like to learn what the Norsemen, I, were about, I'd like to learn what the Scandinavians were about, I would like to learn something, and this is why, it's all history you know. I would like to learn, have learned about and I'm doing I'm making up, I'd like to learn more about differences and the value of differences. That would be a project, I'd like to write.

Speaker 1: Likewise, when you look back on everything you've done to this point in your life, what do you think today would be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think the steel and bronze pieces that I'm beginning to place all over the, the country, I think that that says it all. It is a legacy because it's about truths you know. It's about places you know like Lawrence, Kan- Oklahoma [sic. Lawrence Creek, Oklahoma] and there's another city outside of Tulsa [Oklahoma] where black Americans were bombed. Only place, only thing in history, but anyway there are a lot of places I want to tell stories about, I want to reveal. Like Loewen's [James Loewen] book, 'Sundown Places' [sic. 'Sundown Towns: A Hidden Dimension of American Racism'], I wanna do something like that. I want my work to be a place, a, a body of work where all people are standing in front of and I, I stress that, all people. Because I've seen it happen already a Russian Jew can stand in front of my piece and cry. That has happened so many times. It's not to say, oh wow they're so sad, it's to say that they got it you know, they understand my statement you know. I've materialized my thoughts whereas I used to have a complex and I thought my thoughts were nothing you know, they were so low level, how can I say anything important? But now I can, and they create a response, they make people look at each other and say we instead of me you know. So that, that's what, what I appreciate.

Speaker 1: You mentioned your family briefly you, did you wanna say more about your family before we, you have, you have one daughter?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have two daughters [Natalie Jackson and Alice Jackson].
Speaker 1: Two daughters.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have two beautiful daughters, they're so pretty, every time you mentioned that, I wanna reach back and here's my billfold you know, here's my grandson. Well they take after their mother [Melba Jackson] you know, and that's why they're so beautiful. And now a new addition to the family a grandson you know and, and boy do we, do we cater to him, but it's like here's a new me all of a sudden. Something to live for and to do things for, I mean you know we artist you know, we have low moments, psychological low moments you know.  But I haven't had one of those in a long time; I think it's something to do with serotonin and winter months and grey skies you know. I was kind of a mess last week you know, but I haven't experienced none of that you know in the last five years, it, it's great.

Speaker 1: Now is there anything I haven't asked you about you think we can deal with tonight that I haven't you know that you, that you wanna say, before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Well I, we haven't mentioned you know my involvement with taekkyeon.
Speaker 1: Yes, right, that's right.
Speaker 2: And you know it's a practice that even before the martial arts became popular here in America you know way back in the '60s [1960s] you know.  Studying with this French guy to learning like movements you know, but then twenty years ago I learned something about the civil arts, not the martial arts. Through movement and it happen to lead me to or something called taekkyeon you know the grandfather of all the arts. And I begin to study it intently and I met a person by the name of Mr. Soo Kim [ph.] and other teachers, I met Mrs. Holcomb [ph.] here at SAIC [School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]. But before that, I had set up my own schools, studied very hard, entered tournaments and gave displays of, of the movement, I mean studied a lot. Studied like I did my music and I, I produced so many classes, I taught so many students, and it's so good to have them come back. You know guys that are in the [U.S.] Army and say you know, "Some of the principals that you, you taught me you know, how to remain calm, saved me you know," so I like that.

Speaker 1: Well my last question is similar to, to legacy but a little different. Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered, as a, a universal, a person that loved, a person that contributed, that made his mark on this earth without any prejudices. A person that did something good for all peoples you know, notice I didn't say mankind anymore you know. But for all people, a person that respected the earth and the maker of the earth you know, in a way where others benefited.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If I say more, I'll just repeat what I said so, that's it.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much for what you said.
Speaker 2: Okay, thank you.
