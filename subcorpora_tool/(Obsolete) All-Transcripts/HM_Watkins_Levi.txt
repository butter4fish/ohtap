Speaker 1: I'm gonna start out by just asking you five sort of People magazine-ish types of questions, so bear with me a little bit here.  What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Fish, fried in olive oil, with low saturated fats; chicken, also fried in olive oil, vegetables.  I still like the pig, but in modest amounts.
Speaker 1: All right. What's your favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Spring.  I like, I like--I don't like hot or real cold; I like moderate temperatures.  I just got back from San Diego [California].  I like sort of their kind of weather, but just moderate times, spring, fall.

Speaker 2: Nice, Southern France, Monte Carlo [Monaco]; I've been there a few times.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I have a--mother gave me this--and it--I've forgotten who said it but it's, it's: "Give me the courage to change the things I can, give me the serenity to accept the things I can't change, and the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference," (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) To know--that's the Serenity Prayer.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I think that's my favorite.
Speaker 1: Yes, okay.
Story_ID: 588483
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your mother.  What was her name?
Speaker 2: Lillian--Lillia- Lillian Bernice Varnado [Lillian Varnado Watkins].  She was a--she went to school--went to Lane College in Jackson [Tennessee], but never had a chance to do much teaching because she met my father, Levi, Sr. [Levi Watkins, Sr.], and they had six children.  So, as she says, she's still working, keeping all of us together.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: She could cook, she had a great personali- has a great personality.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: She's staying now with my older sister Marie [Annie Marie Watkins Garraway], but mother is a cheerful, loving, spirited--and gotten more spirited in her older years, but she's a great lady and a great friend.  I try to talk to her almost every day.
Speaker 1: Great.  Okay.  What--do you know where she was born?
Speaker 2: You know, she was born in Mississippi in, I think, a little town called--just outside of Jackson--Canton [Mississippi].  In fact, we went there recently for a funeral and we went to see her house, and I think her house was torn down and I think she was upset about that, but Mississippi was where she was raised.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know anything about her actual growing up years, what it was like?
Speaker 2: No, not really, not really.  She came from a large family.  Her best friend was my aunt.  We call her Wynn [ph.] but--Aunt Steen [Ernestine Varnado Guy], rather.  She's my Cousin Beverly's [HistoryMaker Beverly Guy-Sheftall] mother.  They were all--they were a close family, I know that, of girls and one, two--one boy.
Speaker 1: Did she share any stories with you about her growing up, or--
Speaker 2: No, not really.  She was so busy trying to keep the six of us in order that no, she didn't talk too much about growing up, even to this day.
Story_ID: 588484
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your father.  What was his name, and where was he born?
Speaker 2: Now, he was--his name was Levi Watkins [Levi Watkins, Sr.].  He was born in Gracey, Kentucky, another little small rural area, and he went to--then he moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, went to Burt High School, and then went to Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] which--where I went.  And then he went on to Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois] and got graduate degrees, and he eventually--he was a teacher and eventually became a president of Alabama State University in Montgomery [Alabama State College; Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama].
Speaker 1: What years was he there?
Speaker 2: He retired in '81 [1981].  He had twenty years there, so in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he tell you any stories about, about his childhood?
Speaker 2: You know, near the end, we started talking about some of his brothers and sisters, but I--but not, not really, not really; he was a working--he was a working father.  We didn't have a lot of, you know, fishing trips and things like that.  He was quite--he just worked all the time.
Story_ID: 588485
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your ancestors?
Speaker 2: Grandmothers on mother's [Lillian Varnado Watkins] side, mother.  There's a fair amount of Irish in our--this is where some of my color comes from, and then on daddy's [Levi Watkins, Sr.] side, all the way back to--listening to dad, the first generation of freed slaves.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you know your grandparents at all?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh yeah.  We used to go to, to Tennessee every summer, actually, and stayed with daddy's parents Mary [Mary Watkins (ph.)] and Adam Watkins [ph.].  And then on mother's side, we would always see--Varnado was their name.  Varnado was an unusual name.
Speaker 1: You think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm not sure where they got the name from, but I knew both sets of grandparents, and they really impacted heavily on all of us--on me, but on all of us.  Granddaddy [Willie L. Varnado] on mother's side was a minister, so you had to behave and speak correctly and treat people right.  Then on the other side, Adam, he was a carpenter, but he was a deacon in a church, so there was a lot of church in our growing up.
Story_ID: 588486
Speaker 1: What are some of your earliest memories of growing up?
Speaker 2: Really, it's hard to remember the first two or three, but I, I--my early memories are when we were living in Montgomery, Alabama, and my memories are, are what was happening at that time racially in Montgomery--not being able to go to the zoo, the restaurants, the movie theaters; I can remember all of that.  I can also remember I went to two churches--two civil rights churches: Dr. Abernathy [Ralph Abernathy] First Baptist Church [Montgomery, Alabama], and then later we moved to Dexter Avenue [Dexter Avenue Baptist Church; Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church, Montgomery, Alabama] where Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was, so I have many fond memories of Martin Luther King, listening to him preach.  He also started a little group called the Crusaders.  This, this was to get boys to come up to his parsonage on Tuesdays, to keep us out of trouble during those turbulent times.  But I remember all of, all of that, the differences, the racial differences.  But I also remember the fun that we had, too--the early Christmases, relating to my cousins, going every summer to see my [paternal] grandmother and father [Mary Watkins (ph.) and Adam Watkins (ph.)], and then the school days were, were fun, but those were very complicated and complex times, full of beautiful memories, but also full of not so beautiful memories.
Speaker 1: The Montgomery Bus Boycott.
Speaker 2: Yes, and all that followed, all that followed--the freedom marches, the Sel- the voting march from Selma [Selma to Montgomery March].  And then there, there came a time where we thought we could--were old enough to test the system, and I remember testing--what I mean by that, seeing if we could go in the front door of the Paramount movie theatre [Paramount Theatre; Davis Theatre for the Performing Arts, Montgomery, Alabama], in the front door of the White Tower restaurant and, and Dairy Queen, and we challenged the system quite a bit, and that did lead to some confrontations and violence.
Speaker 1: Was that--you--your parents [Lillian Varnado Watkins and Levi Watkins, Sr.] and your sisters and brothers, or your schoolmates?
Speaker 2: The schoolmates.
Speaker 1: Your schoolmates.
Speaker 2: We had to hide a lot of that from our parents.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I remember one time getting, getting beat up and getting cut.  I have a cut on my hand right now where--I, I received it when I came outta that Paramount movie theatre, and when mother realized where I had been, she just gave me another whooping on top of a whooping.  So, we would often try to hide things from mother.  I remember one time slipping into Oak Park [Montgomery, Alabama]; that was a zoo.  We figured if we got up early enough before the white people came, we could climb over the fence that had barbed wire on it, and I remember I had my suit on 'cause we were getting ready to go to Sunday school, but they saw us and we had to run and get out of that park, and I tore my suit on the barbed wire.  That led to another whooping (laughter) from mother.  So, they were, they were incredible times.
Speaker 1: I bet, I bet, yeah.
Story_ID: 588487
Speaker 1: Give me your siblings' name, and the birth order, including yourself.
Speaker 2: The oldest is Marie Garraway Deep [Annie Marie Watkins Garraway]; she married again after her husband died.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You want the full names?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Marie Garraway Deep, and then there is Emma Pearl Watkins [Emma Watkins]; she's gone back to her maiden name, and then there's me, and then there's Doristeen Minnott [Doristeen Watkins Minnott], my, my sister--youngest sister, and then there's Donald Varnado after mother's side of the family, Donald Varnado Watkins [Donald Watkins].  And then the baby is James Allison Watkins [James Watkins].
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 588488
Speaker 1: What was your community like where you lived?
Speaker 2: We lived on Tuttle Street in Montgomery [Alabama].  I remember one street was dirt; we lived on the corner, and one was dirt and they would pour oil on it so we wouldn't get dusty all the time, and the other was asphalt.  It was sort of low, low middle-class.  It was near Oak Pak [Montgomery, Alabama].  There were individual homes.  I remember daddy [Levi Watkins, Sr.] parking in the, in the, in the dirt--in the grass.  It was close to school, where I went to school.  I went to Alabama State Laboratory School [Montgomery, Alabama].  It was a church community, it was a--there was not a lot of violence.  We enjoyed playing marbles (laughter).  It was just sort of straightforward, but we respected everybody, meaning that other parents--we respected their parents and--
Speaker 1: Now, the laboratory school, was that part of the college (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Alabama State [Alabama State College; Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama].  It was part of the--yeah, it was, it was the part where, where their--Alabama State was a teachers college, and they needed a teaching situation, so they created a school called the laboratory school.  It was a regular school, accredited and all, but the student teachers would come and practice on us.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It, it worked out fine.
Speaker 1: It worked out?
Speaker 2: Yes, it did.
Story_ID: 588489
Speaker 1: Do you remember being in Parsons, Kansas, or di-, your earliest memories were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I don't; yeah, but Montgomery [Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Tell me some sights, sounds, smells that remind you of, of, of growing up.
Speaker 2: Well, the smells would be barbeque (laughter).  Sights would be all the freedom marchers, the, the--every time I see Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] picture, every time I look at--in my own office [at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland], see Coretta King [Coretta Scott King] and see so many people, it reminds me of growing up in Montgomery.  Every time I see a black person achieve, it reminds me of Montgomery.  Every time I hear some music like 'Smoke Gets in Your Eyes' from--who made that?
Speaker 1: Platter.
Speaker 2: The Platters, Montgomery.  I remember when baseball games used to be on the radio, and we would listen--that would be Montgomery.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Those kind of things remind me of, of growing up.
Story_ID: 588490
Speaker 1: Now, was the laboratory school [Alabama State Laboratory School, Montgomery, Alabama]--did it go from elementary to high school?
Speaker 2: Yes it was twelve--yeah, twelve grades.
Speaker 1: Were there any of the teachers that had an influence on you?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, Ms. Murphy [ph.] that, that taught English, Mr. Coston [W.H. Coston], the principal, Mr. Alston [ph.] that taught geometry.  They were strict teachers but they cared for us.  We learned correct English and spoke it.  In fact, we spoke Latin also.  Those were the early high school and junior high school people.  I do, I remember their names this, this far down the road.  Of course, I had others once I got to college and medical school [Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee], and so forth, but they were great teachers; they cared about us.  You know, they also--when we acted out, they also had the ability to punish us.
Speaker 1: Yes, they did.  What kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: I was a good student.  I finished top of the class, valedictorian.  But I also was an athlete; I played basketball, and I thought I was gonna play basketball at Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].  I had made the Montgomery all-star team, but when I got to Tennessee State it was clear these guys were 6'11", I was 6'2", they were two hundred and something, I was 140 [pounds], so I gave up even thinking about basketball and decided to major in, in biology.
Story_ID: 588491
Speaker 1: What type of child were you?  Were you well mannered, rambunctious, mischievous?
Speaker 2: My mother [Lillian Varnado Watkins] and my sisters and brothers would say I was sort of tough 'cause I was the enforcer (laughter).  If my brother Donald [Donald Watkins] didn't do what I told him to do, we would--I'm sure we would fight over something, so probably--I probably was, was tough back then, if you listen to, to, to all the stories that were told.
Speaker 1: So that's what the young Levi [HistoryMaker Dr. Levi Watkins] was like.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  But tough in a certain way; I mean, I knew boundaries.  You know, having a, a, a decent mother and father [Levi Watkins, Sr.], having a minister like Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], having church in your family, you know; you knew what was right and what was wrong, and cursing was not a part of us--never heard it in the family, didn't hear much at school.  In spite of the segregation, those were still decent times personally, within our communities.
Speaker 1: Yeah, church is very, very important.  Did you have dreams and aspirations as a, as a young man coming up?
Speaker 2: You know, I thought I would--at one time I thought I would be a (air quotes) scientist, but I think I started having more dreams once I got to college and medical school.  In high school [Alabama State Laboratory School, Montgomery, Alabama], I just played ball and had good grades--had a great friend named Nicky Walton [ph.]; he was my main man.  We were co-valedictorians, actually.  But I, I don't remember any real major dreams in high school except that I thought I would be a scientist, whatever a scientist was at the time.
Speaker 1: Was there anything that you can think of that might have influenced you as a young person?
Speaker 2: Oh, the examples set by my mother and father and my playmates.  You know, all of us went--we went to school, we, we attended school, we didn't do anything--not too many things bad; we went to college.  The example--and, and, and what people around you were doing, and the church, those were the more powerful influences on me.
Speaker 1: How did you spend your free time?  You said you played basketball.
Speaker 2: Played basketball, you know, we played marbles.  We'd go to the movies--we would go to the movies; there was a black movie theater.  And just hung with the boys.  As things got--as I got older, I learned how to drive; daddy taught me how to drive a car, and then I started working as a lifeguard at the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].  I used to work cutting grass, throwing papers, the Afro-American [Afro-American Newspapers].  I had a lot of little jobs.  Every Saturday I had to shine everybody's shoes for church; that was all six plus his, daddy's.  There were lots of little jobs I had.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Passing the time was not a problem.  I really liked it when I learned how to drive; that's when young ladies started coming into my life like any typical teen.
Speaker 1: Did you attend the prom and things like that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, the prom, and being a basketball player was good; the ladies like basketball players, and we got a chance to go to other schools, and those were fun days (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 588492
Speaker 1: Did you know at an early age that you were going--that you wanted to go to college?
Speaker 2: No, I just--I--it was something that was just natural.  Everybody ahead of us went to college; all my brothers and sisters ahead of me went to college.  Daddy [Levi Watkins, Sr.] went to college [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], mama [Lillian Varnado Watkins] went to college [Lane College, Jackson, Tennessee] and, and everybody in the class, so I didn't--it was, it was more natural than something thought out; it would be unusual not to go to college.  I'm thinking maybe some went to the [U.S.] military, but I would say 99 percent of our class [at Alabama State Laboratory School, Montgomery, Alabama] went to college (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) College. What were some of the things that you did in college, the organizations you belonged to?  I know you said you were an Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah, I was a Alpha--an Alpha, and then there was--Beta Kappa Chi was a science society, Alpha Kappa Mu [Alpha Kappa Mu National Honor Society], I was their national president; that was an honor society, Alpha Kappa Mu; I was president of the student body.  Oh, there was a bunch of things I did.  We partied a lot--we had a lot of parties at Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].  There's a place right behind Tennessee State called College Park--College Hill, and we had many parties there, many Platters [The Platters] records.  So I did a combination of social things; that was when I started getting activist also.  We needed to take on some civil rights things in Nashville [Tennessee].  There were restaurants that our students couldn't eat at; Morrison's Cafeteria, I remember was one.  They had a street running right up in the middle of our campus where our students were getting hurt, and we had to do a sit-in to stop those trucks from coming straight through, and I started--I joined up with SNCC, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.  I got sort of activist in college, and the roots go back to Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and what we were doing in Montgomery [Alabama].  When I said challenging, challenging the movie theaters and challenging Dairy Queen and those roots of activism were, were, were, were being laid back then, so in college, I sort of matured those roots.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 588493
Speaker 1: That led to my decision to integrate Vanderbilt medicine [Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee] later.
Speaker 2: Tell us about that experience.
Speaker 1: That was very different.  First of all, it was the first time I had been around white people in a positive way.  I'd never been in a class where everybody was white but me.  The first day, everybody thought it was all right.  Everybody welcomed me and thought things were fine, but after things settled in, I started seeing the grotesque racism.  The word nigger was used too frequently.  I remember having feces thrown in my face on the campus at Vanderbilt.  That was the first year, and this was not too long after they had turned down--Vanderbilt had turned down Dr. Reverend Lawson [James Lawson] in the divinity school [Vanderbilt University Divinity School, Nashville, Tennessee].  But things got a lot better; I was accepted academically--not so much socially, but I met some wonderful people there that did accept me socially.  When I say socially I mean church, I mean their private clubs--all of that.
Speaker 2: Who were some of those people?  Do you remember?
Speaker 1: John Tarpley; there was a guy named John Tarpley.  He's there right now.  He opened--you know, he opened up his church and I told him, "Man, you know black and white folks don't go to church together in Nashville, Tennessee."  He said, "Let's do it."  And that started a lifelong friendship until this day.  He cared about me from the beginning.  I remember his wife, Marge [Maggie Tarpley], would cook me pinto beans.  She knew about southern soul food, and she would do a lot of that.  But so it matured; things got all--things got--things had gotten much better, and so while now, now, now the, the same face they threw feces in, they have a portrait of now; I'm, I'm one of their trustees now, for the whole university.  It's amazing, the full circle that came from integration to a professorship and trusteeship, and that's what's happening as we sit.
Story_ID: 588494
Speaker 1: Let's go back to Vanderbilt [Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee].  Tell me a little bit more about that experience.  What did you do as far as social activities?  Anything of--
Speaker 2: You know, because I had gone to Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], that first year I didn't do much on Vanderbilt's campus.  I could still go back across the railroad tracks and party at Tennessee State, at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], and at Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee], so a lot of my social activities were still on the other side of town, but as I got to know a few more students, like John Tarpley, and a few others, I started to do a few things on Vanderbilt's campus and around Vanderbilt, little lounges and--but most of what I did was academic on their, on their campus.  The racial things weren't--I was so used to stuff by then coming out of Montgomery [Alabama] dealing with the situation; I was so used to it that it wasn't a big deal.  It was disappointing, you know, people not wanting you to touch--women not wanting me to deliver their babies, jokes about race.  There's a thing called an EKG [electrocardiograph]; people got it and it has different leads--electrical leads.  There's a red one, a white one, a blue and a black, but the way they taught it, they said, "Just remember all--that white is always right."  They were saying that, and what they meant was white should go on the right arm, but the way they said it was something, and some teachers, as I said, using the N word too freely in front of me.  But the acti- I, I ate--I started off eating in the cafeteria but it was clear to me that people didn't want me to eat in the cafeteria, so I found me another little place to eat, or I would go all the way back over to one of the black restaurants that's still there, incidentally, Swett's [Swett's Restaurant, Nashville, Tennessee] (laughter).  They call it Sweats because when you eat all that hot soul food, you start sweating, and it's called Swett's.  But, but things got better at Vanderbilt, and as it did, I started socializing more on, on that campus.  But Vanderbilt was good academically, and I tried to do my best academically there also.
Story_ID: 588495
Speaker 1: I understand that after King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed, you had a poster on your wall (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah--before King was killed.  I--in the dormitory, I put a picture of Dr. King on the outside of my room.  And you know, this was--I'm not sure why I did that, except just that I was so proud of him just in general, but yes.  But that was--but he did get killed.  That, that evening, I came home, he had been shot, and I couldn't--I had a television, I couldn't take my face off of that television.  But then after, after he died, they wrote on that picture, "We finally got the coon."  Wrote on that in feces, "Finally got the coon."  And then the next day, people act like nothing had happened, nothing.  That was a very disappointing and hateful time for me, and I don't like that word or that feeling, because King had always told us to, to love.  And he'd had many threats before but, but I just happened to be at Vanderbilt [Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee] when it happened.  It just made me know that I needed to do what I needed to do at Vanderbilt.  But those were--that, that was a tough day; that was absolutely a tough day.  You know, I had driven--I mean my mind went back to--I used to drive--during the bus boycott [Montgomery Bus Boycott] they had these station wagons that we would--the churches would use to take black people back and forth so they wouldn't have to ride the bus, and after the bus boycott was over and when I was old enough to drive, Dr. King asked me to drive that station wagon and to go and get people and bring 'em to church, and he would tell me who to pick up and--the old ladies and sick ladies and (unclear) folk.  He would tell me how fast to drive, and what time I should be at Dexter [Dexter Avenue Baptist Church; Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church, Montgomery, Alabama] with, with the people.  And afterward, I would take him the station wagon back, and then he would drop me off at home.  Well, those drop off, those times that he did that--when he was killed, all that came back to, to my mind, those evenings.  And then the Crusaders club.  We used to play at his house, and all that came to mind, but for a moment, hate consumed me; I couldn't--I just didn't wanna believe it and didn't wanna see what they wrote on his poster, like snubbing me.  But, but that was just a little glitch in an otherwise beautiful ending of Vanderbilt (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It made you stronger?
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.  I don't know where that poster is now--what I, what I did with that.
Speaker 1: So, so you kept the poster after?
Speaker 2: I did keep it; yeah, I kept it.  It's somewhere in my stuff.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 588496
Speaker 1: You graduated from Vanderbilt [Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee] in what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy [1970].
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy [1970].
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy [1970].
Speaker 1: So, between '68 [1968] and '70 [1970], how did things go for you there, after, after King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed and--
Speaker 2: Oh, I would use the word okay, okay.  Some people--I think some of the classmates that thought it was all--nothing at the beginning, realized how powerful it was, not just on me, but on the world, because right after that, they started having riots in Nashville [Tennessee] and different places.  I think his death did help bring the issue of race back up at, at Vanderbilt, although they didn't take any more blacks until I finished, so I was there four years alone.
Speaker 1: Alone.
Speaker 2: But all that did was made me study harder.
Speaker 1: Tell me about graduation.
Speaker 2: At Vanderbilt?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It was great.  Daddy [Levi Watkins, Sr.] came, mother [Lillian Varnado Watkins] came.  I think that was the first time they had ever been on Vanderbilt's campus.  Grandaddys [Adam Watkins (ph.)] came from Clarksville, Tennessee.  Vanderbilt was the--back then that was the big school to everybody, black and white.  Vanderbilt was all it, so it was a great day to see all of my par- my parents, relatives, grandparents, and to be, be able to walk across that stage in spite of what happened two years earlier.  And as it turns out, I did better than I thought I had.  They didn't give us grades, so you never knew how you did (laughter).  You know, we didn't have A, B, Cs and Fs; they just--if you didn't do poorly you just, you just went on to the next class.  And you only find out how you, how you did at the time when you went to the dean to see where you should go for internship.  But, but that day was a good day.  By then, I knew where I was gonna go for medical--for internship.  So it was, it was a good--it was a good day, and it was great to see my grandparents, who never thought anything like this would happen.  And my mother didn't want me to go to Vanderbilt anyway; she wanted me to go to Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee], the black school [HBCU].  She said, "It would be enough just trying to be a doctor, much less putting up with the, the crap that I might have to put up with this integration business," (laughter), as she puts it.  But it was, it was a--it was a great day for all of us, for everybody.
Speaker 1: Were your--they were, they were treated well when they came on campus (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes, oh yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 588497
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where did you go after, after graduation?
Speaker 2: You know I left--well that was, I spent the summer, I think, at home.  That was July--no, let's see.  No, graduation was in June, and in July I had to report to Johns Hopkins [Johns Hopkins Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland].  I had realized I had been accepted here in the internship class for surgery, so I spent a little time at home but then came to--drove to Baltimore [Maryland] to begin my surgical training.  I didn't know I was gonna get to Johns Hopkins.  One of the guys at Vanderbilt [Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee] suggested--you were asking about influences in your life.  There was a man down there named Scott [Henry William Scott, Jr.]; he was chief of surgery, and when I went to see him, he said, "You should go to the mecca for your training."  And I didn't know where the--I didn't know what he was talking about.  He said, "The mecca," and I thought he meant either Hopkins or Harvard [Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts], but I wasn't sure which one, so I just kept my mouth shut to figure out which one was it.  And he started talking about crab cakes, and I think he must be talking about Hopkins in Baltimore.  So Dr. Scott suggested I do that, and that's what made me apply here, and I got in.
Speaker 1: What was that experience like?
Speaker 2: Coming here?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, it was almost--this one was--I was intimidated at first because it was a huge--much bigger than Vanderbilt, much more famous than Vanderbilt.  But there are many similarities, you know, I thought I was going north; I thought this was the North where people did things equally.  But this was just like Montgomery [Alabama]: blacks in the basement, white folks in the tower, not many students, interns, residents, faculty.  It was almost like doing Vanderbilt over again, but without the grotesque things that happened at Vanderbilt.  So, it was intimidating at first, and I just was quiet and did my job but, but took notice of everything.
Speaker 1: Were there other black faculties at the time?
Speaker 2: No, no.  We had one black faculty person here, Dr. Smoot, who ended up to be one of my patients, Roland Smoot; he's passed now, but no, he was--we're talking about one out of three thousand or something.  But in the back of my mind I knew there would come a day where I would deal with that issue here but, but back then I just was trying to get my ducks in order.
Story_ID: 588498
Speaker 1: You went to Harvard [Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts] and did cardiac research.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Part of getting your ducks in order, part of that is at this place you do research, and you do a lot of research.  So part of my eight years of (unclear) in training, two were in research, and I went up to Harvard because there's a guy named Cliff Barger [A. Clifford Barger]; he was another great mentor, Cliff Barger, and we worked on something called the renin angiotensin system.  We were looking for a drug that would help in heart failure.  One of our friends created the drug.  I created, surgically, the model to test it in, and lo and behold, that drug, it became very successful, and that's what we use today, ACE inhibitors [angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor], they call them.  But that's what I did at Harvard; I had a great time out there, but that was all animal work.  And when I finished Harvard, I came back to Hopkins [Johns Hopkins Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland] to finish my surgery and cardiac surgical training.
Speaker 1: What was the atmosphere like at, at Harvard at that time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know what?  About the same; it's another dis- it was a disappointment.  They were supposed to be the--they advertised themselves as the intellectual center of the world, but when I was there, they were fighting about letting blacks on north beach, or something; they had a beach up there or something.  Some of the--and, and busing--they were all messed up over busing; it was almost like being in Montgomery [Alabama] except they had a northern accent.  The racial thing was the same.  Harvard didn't have many black faculty; they had more students than we had here, but it was almost the same as Hopkins, the same as Vanderbilt [Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee].  You know, Malcolm X once said if you live below the Canadian border, you are in the South, and I would concur with that, having gone to Harvard, to Hopkins, to Vanderbilt.  But I had a good time up there.  You can always--[HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou said, "There's always a rainbow in the clouds," and everywhere I have gone in the clouds, I've found a rainbow.  So at Harvard it was Cliff Barger; he was my rainbow.  Here at Hopkins, I've found quite a few rainbows.  At Vanderbilt, Dr. Scott [Henry William Scott, Jr.], Dr. Chapman [John E. Chapman]; at Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] Dr. Mollett [ph.], Dr. Murrell [Robert N. Murrell].  I mean, I found a whole bunch of rainbows--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --in my, in my clouds.
Speaker 1: So you were at Harvard from '73 [1973] to '75 [1975]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, for two years, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 588499
Speaker 1: And then you came back to Johns Hopkins [Johns Hopkins Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what did you do when you came back?
Speaker 2: Heart surgery.
Speaker 1: Heart surgery?
Speaker 2: Heart surgery.  I trained, I trained in heart surgery.  And that finished--I finished that around '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: Seventy-eight [1978], okay.
Speaker 2: Seventy-seven [1977], '78 [1978] was my last year of training, and then I joined the faculty.
Speaker 1: What was your position on the faculty?  What was your title?
Speaker 2: Assistant professor, assistant professor, cardiac surgery.
Speaker 1: One of the things I also read was that you are--you were on the admissions committee?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Do you remember I was saying I, I was taking note of everything?  I, I saw it when we didn't have African American or other minorities here; I paid attention to that, and so one of the first things I did was join the admissions committee, and then traveled America to find the best and, and, and, and bring them back here and, and, and ensure them that we would embrace them and, and make a big--you know, make it--that they would do well.  So I did that a lot; I traveled here, Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California], and all over, and I did that on weekends, and it paid off.  The students came, the kids came.  Now, wherever I go, they're in all the cities; they've done exceptionally well.  People always talk about affirmative action and qualifications with this and that, and this and that.  I can tell you we brought in some great students; one of 'em, Selwyn, just got named the chief of surgery at the University of Minnesota [University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, Minnesota]; he's a boy from Alabama.  But I can name many, many more, and I'm talking now about hundreds and hundreds of students, so that, that admissions work was very important to me.  I knew if we could bring a critical mass, we would keep getting 'em.  I also knew that if we had a critical mass, we would have a mass that we could have a faculty develop from, we could have interns and residents develop from.  So it was very important to have that root--that, that mass of African American students so that we could progress with the interns and residents and faculty and so forth, and that's what's happened.
Speaker 1: Any student that you can think of that stands out that you would--
Speaker 2: Lisa Ebwonno [ph.]; Lisa is--she finished at the top of this class, she didn't let 'em tell her what to do.  Lisa--I mean I, I could just name so many.  Selwyn Vickers.  And I'm talking about now following their whole lives.  When I did mentorship, my mentorship meant for life, and that's the way I--that's why I know what they're doing right now.  No, I hate to call two names 'cause I could call a hundred.
Speaker 1: A hundred, yes.
Story_ID: 588500
Speaker 1: Talk a little bit about the--your defibrillator.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: And what was--when did, when did that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that--we--that was conceived in the late '70s [1970s] by a friend of mine, Dr. Mirowski [Michel Mirowski].  And then there was a company, Medrad [Medrad, Inc.], M-E-D-R-A-D, Medrad; it was a scientific biomedical engineering company that came up with the physics and engineering of it.  Well--and then there was me (laughter) that came up with the implantation.  We got together, but Dr. Mirowski conceived it because he had lost a close friend of his to sudden death.  The defibrillator is a device that shocks the heart back to normal.  The heart should beat like this (demonstrates) regularly, sixty times or, or more, but when it quivers like this (demonstrates), you, you're, you're dead in a few minutes, unless it gets shocked back into that regularity.  Well, he lost a friend to that, and he came up with an idea, and then we all bonded in the late '70s [1970s].  I did a lot of the animal work, coming up with the model, putting it in animals, testing it, testing it, and testing it, and when it looked like it was gonna work, we got approval from the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] to begin a trial in humans, and the first human came in, in February of 1980 from Stanford University in California [Stanford, California].  She brought all of her doctors, and the operating room was packed for the first implant; Vivien Thomas was still around.  Vivien was a great friend of mine that worked with Blalock [Alfred Blalock] on the blue baby operation, but Vivien was a close friend of mine and helped me with the animal work for the defibrillator.  But the first one we put in in, in 1980--February of '80 [1980]; it was incredible.  It was the first time that we had stopped--ordinarily, in all of your training, we are taught to start the human heart, keep the heart going (laughter), not stop it.  So this lady, we stopped her heart and we had to stop it just to see if the defibrillator would shock it back, and it, it did this for thirty seconds, and when you have no blood pressure for thirty seconds, it seems like a lifetime.  Then we're about to use the old paddles, but then that thing shocked, and after that shock, that changed the whole--that changed the whole treatment of sudden death, even now.  So it was an incredible time.  We had to go through a lot more between the years, but I was mentioning it's amazing to look at the television and see the machine advertised as standard treatment--extending lives, and knowing that we had a role in the very first one.  They have a million of 'em implanted right now across America and the world.  But that's the way that came; that made my whole career, that helped me get some ducks in order.
Speaker 1: 'Cause then you went on to become full professor [at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And that was in 1991?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '91 [1991] is when I got the--to be full professor, but that professorship was based a lot on the work of human, human defibrillation.
Speaker 1: And then you were appointed dean the same year (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, around that same time, yeah.
Speaker 1: That was dean for--
Speaker 2: Dean for postdoctoral affairs, so I was in charge of all of our interns and residents; we had about a thousand of those, and also all of our postdocs.  These are our scientists, and we have another thousand or so of them, so I was doing that in addition to doing heart surgery.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 588501
Speaker 1: Tell us about your father [Levi Watkins, Sr.], and what you did as far as surgery on him.
Speaker 2: Let me tell you.  I think--you know, you think about your life, you, you, you think about the things that have meant the most to you.  Well, probably this thing, operating on him.  He was, he was an older man, eighty-one years old.  His heart was weak, meaning working at about 18 percent of normal, and he was considered high risk surgery, high risk.  And so a number of the places decided maybe he needed medical treatment because of how high risk the operation was.  Well, he assured 'em not to worry, that his boy would take care of him 'cause his boy was at Johns Hopkins [The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland].  And they told him, "You know, your boy can't operate on you; we don't do that in families."  Well, I knew that also, so I--my daddy called me and he said, "I want you to--," and, and I was about to just say no right away.  He say, "Wait a minute, man, let's think about it and pray on it."  And I did that, and I convinced myself through prayer, through Reverend Dobson [HistoryMaker Reverend Vernon Dobson], my preacher here, through Homer Favor, one of my good friends here, through the family.  I--we decided that--I, I decided I could do it.  Well, I knew I could do it technically, all along; the, the toughest part was the emotional part of it, and so I convinced myself through prayer that faith accomplishes, accomplishes all.  So, I told daddy I would do it.  My family was divided at first, but then the night before, suddenly the night before, they all came together.  What daddy needed was a triple bypass and a valve, mitral.  It was high risk surgery because he was old and his heart was not working at, at 60 or 70 percent--it was at 18 percent.  We did the operation, and then the heart wouldn't start back up, and I said, "Lord, have mercy."  And so everybody in that room knew that was daddy; I'm looking at it, I started squeezing it, squeezing it, giving epinephrine, giving this, giving that, go back on the heart machine.  We worked on it forty-five minutes; I been doing that forty-five minutes, I was thinking about mama [Lillian Varnado Watkins], my brothers and sisters, myself.  I couldn't believe that this thing wouldn't start.  But boy, let me tell you; it started (demonstrates), and I said, "Lord, I thank you.  I'll never, ever doubt you."  He lived two more years.  We had a good time.
Speaker 1: I'll bet that was a special time, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.  I got a book I'll give you; it's entitled, 'Here is My Hope' ['Here is My Hope, A Book of Healing and Prayer: Inspirational Stories of Johns Hopkins Hospital,' Randi Henderson and Richard Marek].  It's--they wrote a chapter about that procedure in that book, but it was incredible.  Now, I will never do that again (laughter).  It did make me operate on a whole lot of friends 'cause friends wanted me to operate on 'em, but it's different from your father.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, it is.
Speaker 2: But I learned a lot from that--strength, faith, how you can't doubt.  I think I emerged stronger.  A lot of people thought I was crazy.  The chief of surgery said, "Levi, if I had known you had done that, I would have fired you."  But it was all done by then (laughter).
Speaker 1: How did you--how were you able to keep that from them? (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't tell anybody--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --I just went out and I looked on the schedule: "Patient Levi Watkins, Surgeon Levi Watkins [HistoryMaker Dr. Levi Watkins]," but I think they--people just thought it was an error or something.  But no, it changed our lives; it changed our relationship to each other, me and dad.
Speaker 1: I understand that right after he passed, there was a book that he did that came out?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, about--yeah.  He was, he was writing a book but we didn't--and it came the, the day of the funeral.  We opened it up, and there it was.  He dedicated it to me, and had, you know, had a little more to say.
Speaker 1: I bet that was a special feeling.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Incredible, incredible feeling.
Story_ID: 588502
Speaker 1: Getting back to your father a little bit, tell me a little bit about that relationship those last two years that he was alive, and after you had performed the surgery on him.
Speaker 2: You know, we never hugged each other; we always shook hands.  I remember when he came back for a visit, and I did the usual, he asked for a hug (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Before the surgery he was, he was Dr. Watkins [Levi Watkins, Sr.], you know; he was the graduate of the--it was his name.  After surgery he wanted to reverse everything.  He would tell everybody I was Dr. Watkins [HistoryMaker Dr. Levi Watkins], all these people around here.  He didn't wanna sign anything.  He said, "Get him to sign it."  It was the reverse; it was almost like I was the father.  He trusted me.  We had a good time, we had a good time.  I called him all the time.  I think we enjoyed each other more.  I wish I had called him more.  We talked more.  I would get him to review my speeches.  When I speak, I try to, I try to make it so that you don't misunderstand what I'm saying (laughter), and sometimes they're hard hitting, and step on the toes that need to be stepped on, but daddy would sort of make sure they weren't too tough, and that they still had class.  He would do that and read 'em for me and say, "Hey, you know, do this, do that."  But the relationship changed completely; it was almost liked he was the son, and any of the decisions needed to be done, you know, "Ask Levi."  He was a wise man to the end.  He asked me to help him with the will--to make his will.  I remember he said, "You know, you, you don't get anything."  (Laughter) He said, "Your sister Pearl [Emma Watkins], your, your sister."  He said, "You're fine." Just fine (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you were.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: And you were.
Speaker 2: And I was, yeah.  And I knew what he was trying to do.  But it was just pure happiness, so--so that's why I keep the--his picture in my office; say hello to him every day.  I have some of his cufflinks, some pictures of us together.  But like I said, I wouldn't do it again because those forty-five minutes of, of doing that (demonstrates) was--they were tough, but it's something you go through, and I'm glad we went through.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Me, me and the whole family; not just--the whole family--and friends, and friends.
Speaker 1: Another situation that made you stronger.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so, I think so, because people--a lot of people thought I was crazy.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 588503
Speaker 1: Let's go back for a minute, and you talked about your friend Vivien, the doctor (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Vivien Thomas, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Talk a little bit about the things that most doctors at--that were coming out during your time, what they went through as, as they were trying to establish their careers.
Speaker 2: Well, I'll tell you the toughest part was when you come here as an intern and start training, and we take twenty--at the time, we would take twenty-two interns, cut sixteen, and keep four to train 'em all the way up; we had a pyramid system.  So it was pure hard work, but once you finished training at a place like this, it was easy to get a job because Hopkins [Johns Hopkins Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland] had a lot of history, and most of our guys went into academic as opposed to private practice.  They would go to other universities, they would be chiefs of surgery at different places.  So the hardest part, I think, was the training.  And then once you finished, develop what your niche will be, develop what your situation will be.  Like for me, it was human defibrillation.  Vivien Thomas, Vivien Thomas was a black guy that--I was always a generation ahead of him.  He wanted to go to Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] but the Depression [Great Depression] stopped him; I went to Tennessee State; he then went to Vanderbilt [Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee] as a technician.  He wanted to be a doctor.  I was a generation later.  I went to Vanderbilt as a doctor--as a student.  He came to Johns Hopkins; he wanted to be a surgeon--heart surgeon, and here it was I was able to, to be a heart surgeon.  We met here--he and I met here, and I realized who he was; he was the guy that trained most of our famous surgeons.  This man didn't, didn't even have a college degree, training the nation's and the world's finest heart surgeons.  He had a gift; he just had a gift of dexterity and also a gift of just knowledge.  I always say that sometimes manmade degrees don't mean anything when you compare 'em to God given degrees, and that's what Vivien had.  Vivien helped train me, and in the process we got to be friends.  When he died, his family wanted me to do his eulogy, and I did his eulogy, and all these famous doctors were back.  This blue baby operation opened up all--the whole field of heart surgery.  Babies were coming--blue babies are babies that don't have enough blood going to their, to their bodies, and so their lips are blue, their skin is blue, and they came up with an operation to turn that all around, and Vivien was a key to that.  So all these surgeons were there at the funeral, but he wanted me to do the eulogy, and I did that with pride.  Twenty years later, I did his wife's eulogy, Clara [Clara Flanders Thomas].  But Vivien never was--he was never able, in his time, to, to do the things he wanted to.  But near the end, he got a portrait made that's on the walls here right now, in two movies--one called 'Something the Lord Made,' aptly so, and the other one is 'Partners of the Heart.'   But he was quite a man, Vivien Thomas.
Speaker 1: That was the reason I asked you about him because I remembered that movie and just interested in the struggles that he had.
Speaker 2: Yes, he went through the racial struggles, you know.  He couldn't even wear a white coat.  And when Dr. Blalock [Alfred Blalock] had that big sixty-fifth birthday party down at the hotel, Vivien couldn't go 'cause black folks couldn't go to the hotel.  This was the man that helped make--made the surgeon.  But, Vivien found a rainbow in the clouds, and now a lot of people know who it is--something the Lord made.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Story_ID: 588504
Speaker 1: Back to your--some of your, your activist activities.  I understand that you have organized some underpaid researchers here at Hopkins [Johns Hopkins Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  We had--in America, in America we had people, we had people--they call 'em postdocs; they have their doctorate either M.D. or Ph.D., or M.D./Ph.D., and they do science, but for--in America they had no organization.  They were just hooked up with another professor, and that professor could pay what he wanted to pay, depending on how much money the professor had.  So, we organized 'em.  There was an article in a bo- on Science magazine, and they called it--I told 'em we--they were on the back of the bus-'Getting to the Front of the Academic Bus' [sic. 'Getting to the Front of the Bus,' Dan Ferber].  And so we organized them, the postdocs, to get them representative pay, get them representative benefits, get them representative opportunities, get them due process when there's argument or something.  So we started that [Johns Hopkins University Postdoctoral Association], the first chapter in America, back in '92 [1992].  Now, there are a whole host of chapters all over America, and now they have a national organization.  But I saw them sort of like--well, I saw 'em on the back of the bus.  They weren't, they weren't--they did not get the kind of benefits and salaries that I thought they should, so with me being the dean, you know, we just tackled that issue.  I tried to do one of those things Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] did, have it profoundly, morally right so they can't argue with it, or if they do, it'll just be awhile, and if it's, if it's morally right, it's easier to get done.  I did use my civil rights background to, to sort of finesse it, but yeah, we started that, and I still work with them today.
Speaker 1: Oh, you do?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 588505
Speaker 1: Tell us about the, the Robert Wood Minority Faculty Development Program [Harold Amos Medical Faculty Development Program].
Speaker 2: Oh, that's a very important program, that's a very important program.  It's a program designed to do for America what we were trying to do at Hopkins [Johns Hopkins Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland]: increase, increase the number of minority faculty in America, to have it representative of, of our demographics in America, 13 percent or so.  Well, that's, that's the way it was--that's what the program was about.  After we had gotten some publicity on, on, on increasing the number of students here, and which we did, a good number, I was asked to join this foundation by a good friend of mine, Dave Rogers [David E. Rogers], who I met at Vanderbilt [Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee] who supported my integrating that Vanderbilt situation.  He had left Vanderbilt, Dave Rogers, and had come to Hopkins where he had been dean, and helped me then, and then he left Hopkins to be president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation [Princeton, New Jersey].  But he knew America's medical schools had very poor representation and he started the program, so they put together a national board, and I joined it, and the whole point was to find the finest minority applicants to increase, absolutely and relatively, the percentages on America's medical campuses.  And what we do, we give 'em almost a hundred thousand dollars for four years for research; we give it to the schools, too.  That has been very, very rewarding and successful, and I'm still on this--sometimes, people call things they don't like programs.  They call throwing money at things.  Well, we threw money at the right things.  You know, when you got the right stuff, it works.  These kids that we brought in were made out of the right stuff, and it did work, and that's--it's, it's still going today.  We need it even more because we've emerged into some--I call 'em difficult and unfortunately conservative times.  I see us going backwards in America.  In fact, we had to take the word, minority off of the program that I was just talking about.  I see 'em--the conservatives and right wing people attacking affirmative action.  That decreases the number of the pool that we were using to develop the faculty from, so we need the program right now, but that's what that program was from, Robert Wood Johnson.  I take my hat off to that organization; that's the Johnson and Johnson people [Johnson and Johnson Products; Johnson and Johnson Services, Inc.].  So, we still work to try to keep a minority faculty representative.  And let me tell you, you must have diversity.  If you don't have diversity, you missed a whole portion of life, a whole portion of the world; you have your students exposed to nothing but your own race when they could be exposed to the, to the rainbow.  So that's why I work on it, I work on it pretty seriously and pretty hard.
Story_ID: 588506
Speaker 1: Any other organizations or boards that you work on?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes I--my sister--I refer to her a lot; she is my sister.  I'm talking about [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou; she is.  We started--she started at Wake; she's, she's at Wake Forest [Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina].  She started the, the Maya Angelou Center for Health Disparities [Maya Angelou Center for Health Equity].  That's another area I am very interested in.  In America, in America, right now, as you and I talk, 120,000 African American men--innocent African American men, women and children die every year simply because of--they don't get care, and this is after they have health insurance.  They can have the same health insurance as other counterparts, still going on right now.  It is a major disgrace, and I don't wanna get in too much of it, but healthcare disparities.  We know about it, the government knows about it, Dave Satcher [HistoryMaker Dr. David Satcher] at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] wrote about it; I've wrote part of his book.  We--that's, that's a very tough issue, but Maya has started a center to try to help close some of those gaps.  In fact, I just got a letter from them about a week ago, so I'll be going down there.  I'm--fortunate--I'm on the board of directors.  I was on Bennett College--Bennett in, in Greensboro [North Carolina]; I was on their board of trustees and I tried to support my sister Johnnetta Cole's [Johnnetta B. Cole] efforts to bring them back to, to the level of excellence that they once knew.  Oh--well, a lot of different things--black surgeons, black cardiologists--a whole host of, of things.  But Robert Wood Johnson [Minority Faculty Development Program; Harold Amos Medical Faculty Development Program] and Maya's thing, that's hitting pretty clo- those, those--I'm spending more time.
Speaker 1: Those are your heart.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  This business I said about healthcare disparities, that is the most disgraceful situation I have seen recently and you don't hear anybody talking about it that much.  You sure don't hear Bush [President George Walker Bush] talking about it.
Speaker 1: Have you ever appeared before [U.S.] Congress or anything?
Speaker 2: Who, me?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  I need to appear before 'em more, but they are so consumed with this war they don't--they can't see the world--or at least some of 'em.  But that's a major thing.  I speak all over.  I speak all over, and I use my speaking engagements to address and to enlighten people about those deaths.  We used to say, "Well, they were poor, and they just didn't have money."  I'm not even talking about the poor; I'm talking about those that are fortunate enough to have health insurance.  Recall, though, there're still 47 million Americans that don't have health insurance at all.
Speaker 1: At all.
Speaker 2: I'm talking about those that do have it, and that's what--that's why I call it a disgrace.
Speaker 1: So you're saying that even though we have the health insurance, we don't get the proper care.
Speaker 2: Right, the proper care.  I'm still saying the systems and people still have stereotypes, still have prejudices, biases.  It's complex now; I won't just use one word like racism, but that's part of it, that's part of it, yes, and everybody knows it, too.

Speaker 1: Tell me about some of the work you've done with some other physicians.  Say--I know you're, you're friends with LaSalle Leffall [HistoryMaker Dr. LaSalle D. Leffall, Jr.] over at Howard [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, you know, we all needed, we all needed role models, and I was coming through at a time when there weren't many, and it's still not a lot, but we have more.  But I was blessed to have had some incredible men in my life, and I, I still include Vivien Thomas in that category.  But at Howard University they had this great guy, LaSalle Leffall; he was chief of surgery, but he was also the first black president of the surgical association [American College of Surgeons], and that made us all feel, feel good and, and, and on top of that he was just a good guy to hang out with at the meetings.  But there's also Claude Organ [Claude H. Organ, Jr.].  Claude Organ was also big in organized surgery, who just passed recently, wrote a book ['A Century of Black Surgeons: The U.S.A. Experience,' eds. Claude H. Organ, Jr. and Margaret M. Kosiba] we helped write--contribute, rather.  He and, and LaSalle were friends, but there were about a handful, not many, of, of academic surgeons; they were mentors to me.  I, I try to be today, to a whole lot more people, what they were to me.  We're gonna have an exhibit here soon.  National Library of Medicine [U.S. National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland] is having an exhibit on academic surgeons ['Opening Doors: Contemporary African American Academic Surgeons'], and we all are gonna be in that exhibit.  I don't know when it starts, but it's sometime soon.  But no, I've, I've been blessed to know a lot of people--a lot of people, both inside and outside of medicine.  I know more people outside of medicine, actually.  Coming up in Montgomery [Alabama] knowing the Kings, knowing, knowing Coretta [Coretta Scott King], knowing--knowing many people that came to help the movement like Belafonte [HistoryMaker Harry Belafonte], Andy [HistoryMaker Andrew Young], taking care of some of their families.  Tutu [Desmond Tutu], from South Africa, Winnie Mandela--just a whole people; taking care of Mrs. Parks [Rosa Parks] before she died.  But it all fits, medicine or non-medicine--that, that humanity is a common thread as far as I'm concerned.
Speaker 1: So, a lot of people do call on you to, to, to be consultants to their families?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: And call (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] introduced me one time, he said, "This is the doctor to the movement."  (Laughter) You know, Jesse knows how to, how to talk, but he's a good friend, Jesse's a good friend.  But when anything happens to 'em, yes they do call, and I bring 'em right here to Johns Hopkins [The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland], no matter where they are, no matter where they are.  And that's a whole lot of people, whole lot of people.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But that's a blessing; for me it's a blessing.
Story_ID: 588508
Speaker 1: I saw some of the pictures in your office, and you talked about the fact that you bring a lot of folk here to, to the campus [Johns Hopkins Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Yes.  We started a King program [Martin Luther King Jr. Commemoration].  Now, some, some come on personal reasons, for medical reasons, but we started a King program years ago, and we brought people to help not just celebrate the birthday of King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], but to celebrate the philosophy and to do more than what we need.  So--do more about what he was about.  So, yeah, Mrs. King [Coretta Scott King] came twice, Maya [HistoryMaker Maya Angelou] came twice--what, two weeks ago, Andy [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] came, Stevie Wonder came, Harry [HistoryMaker Harry Belafonte] came, [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis and [HistoryMaker] Ruby Dee came, Ralph Abernathy when he was alive; Ralph actually baptized me before we went to King's church [Dexter Avenue Baptist Church; Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church, Montgomery, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: We've had a whole host of--[HistoryMaker] James Earl Jones, [HistoryMaker] Danny Glover.  Danny's a great friend and a great speaker, and he, and he--he's, he's not afraid of anything.  I try to have people that are not afraid and don't--they don't cherish, cherish silence, they speak out.  So all those pictures are--they were either here to speak or to just visit.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the choir.
Speaker 2: Oh (laughter).  You know, well, at the King program, I knew Dr. King loved gospel, so--I love gospel also, so when I had a program, I needed to have a little flavor in that program.  I needed some gospel, some, some, some black folks' music.  So a friend and I went over to talk to the president; at the time it was Peterson [Ronald Peterson].  Nobody was very enthusiastic about a big ol' hospital like this having a black choir, we only have a white choir.  So--but, you know, we prevailed.  The choir is made up of our employees.  We were amazed--I was amazed at how much natural talent.  We've got people sweeping these floors and singing, and you could hear it as they sing, and walking and carrying the trays and all the towels and stuff, singing.  Well, we got 'em all together and they're called Unified Voices, and they are awesome.  So they brought so much to the program; well, as I say, they brought so much to the program, but as I say they brought so much to the institution that was culture that I wanted Hopkins to see in person.  You know, they get exposed to so much stuff on television and in the community that we live in, but I wanted 'em to see a whole 'nother culture, see men and women singing from their hearts, crying because they're happy, willing to take a whole day off to help us with the King program.  So, yep, we got a nice, nice choir.  Dr. Greg Branch [Gregory W. Branch] is the--is in charge of the choir.
Story_ID: 588509
Speaker 1: Let's talk about some of your awards and degrees.  I understand that when Mayor Donald Schaefer [William Donald Schaefer] was mayor, he named you one of Baltimore's Best.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, he was Schaefer is--he's--he doesn't work anymore now, but he's a good friend.  But they--he developed this thing, Baltimore's Best People, and it just meant people who were doing some things, and I think he was looking at the, the King program [Martin Luther King Jr. Commemoration]; I think he was looking at the defibrillator; he heard me speak multiple times, he was watching all the folks I was bringing into town.  I had him meet Belafonte [HistoryMaker Harry Belafonte], Desmond Tutu, so he--so when it came time, he named me Baltimore's Best.  It was a sweet little honor.  I didn't tell anybody about it; I just went down and got it (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).  You received several juries, I understand.  Doctor of humane letters from Sojourner-Douglass [Sojourner-Douglass College, Baltimore, Maryland], you've received Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia]--
Speaker 2: Spelman, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Morgan State [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Morgan State.
Speaker 1: Any others?
Speaker 2: State, Sojourner-Douglass, Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Meharry, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think also, the people that were--just took note of what you were trying to do professionally and personally and, and I spoke at all those commencements, but that was--those were honor--I felt honored at those things, particularly Spelman because Dr. Cole [Johnnetta B. Cole] said, "Not many men get our, get our degrees."  She said, "We try to give our degrees to women."  "But," she said, "every now and then there's somebody."  And so Johnnetta gave me that degree.  And then Meharry, Meharry.
Story_ID: 588510
Speaker 1: I respected Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].  There was a time when I got into trouble at Vanderbilt [Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee] and I needed to leave the campus, and so what I did was went over to Meharry and stayed--my old roommate was at Meharry so I stayed in his room for--oh, a month or two, until things got quiet on Vanderbilt's campus.  What happened was they threw some feces in my face at Vanderbilt, and I went and got my boys for retribution, and I should not have brought people on that campus.  I did take the law into my hands, but rather than leave school, I left the campus for a while.
Speaker 2: Did your parents [Lillian Varnado Watkins and Levi Watkins, Sr.] find out about that?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.  They weren't happy, they were not happy.  I went over with these guys; they were football players.  They liked me 'cause I got 'em new uniforms, you know, and they knew I had gone to Vanderbilt, and they always said, "If they mess with you just come and get us," and I did.  The problem was they had been drinking beer all day and they felt very uninhibited.  But I moved off the campus for a while and stayed at Meharry.  So I told Meharry when they were giving me the degree, when I was speaking and how much they meant to me, and a lot of people didn't know that story.  But, but I feel very close to Meharry.
Story_ID: 588511
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about the PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] special, 'A Dream Fulfilled.'
Speaker 2: Oh, that was a great--that was a great documentary; it was done by Bill Kurtis.  I see him on the A and E channel now, but Bill came--he was more interested in documenting the development of the defibrillator, so he came and spent, oh, maybe a week here at Hopkins [Johns Hopkins Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland] following me around, watching surgery, interviewing the patients, and then he said, "Listen, I want to, I want to--I want to--."  He didn't do his homework but he said, "I wanna do my--I wanna do one scene at your house."  He said, "I wanna show you in a casual setting."  So I told him I lived on the water, and I--he said, "You have a boat?"  I said, "Yeah, I got a boat," and he said, "Well, let's go shoot a scene on the boat."  Well, to get to the boat, you had to go through my house.  In my house is the same kind of pictures that are in my office; it's a whole wall, and I call it the Wall of Struggle.  So Bill Kurtis looked, he said, "You know all these people?"  I said, "Yes."  He said, "Dr., I got a whole new idea.  We've got to relate the defibrillator to the Civil Rights Movement.  Some of these people have to be in this thing."  And he came up with the title, 'Dream Fulfilled,' and the point was being able to go on and do the schooling and so forth and so on, but--he said, "Do you think I can get Rosa Parks to come down and you all go back through Dexter Avenue Baptist Church [Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church, Montgomery, Alabama]?"  I said, "That's your business, man.  You, you call her and tell her what you wanna do. I'm not asking Mrs. Parks to do anything."  He did, she said, "I'll do anything for Levi [HistoryMaker Dr. Levi Watkins]."  She came, we went to, to church.  I went back to Oak Park [Montgomery, Alabama], that park I was telling you about where I tore my pants.  So, he made a heck of a documentary, and won whatever they--whatever--Emmys [Emmy Award] or Gra- something [George Foster Peabody Award], and it played, it played, oh, it played--I would say, three or four dozen times, 'cause people still see it.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: That one was, yeah, 'Dream Fulfilled,' that was 'Dream Fulfilled.'  But that's how that came about.  So, what he did, he took it from the defibrillator, all to civil rights, he went back and got pictures of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], got young pictures of me, had Rosa Parks come down in person.  He put it all together.  It was some--it was awesome.  I, I took my hat off to him, but he had to shoot--to do all of that, he had to shoot a whole--we were just doing one final scene, you know, at home; he had to shoot another week or two, and that's where that came from--'Dream Fulfilled.'  He had, you know, patients on it.  Oh, it was good.
Story_ID: 588512
Speaker 1: You received an honor here [Johns Hopkins Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland] also, the alumni association Heritage Award?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I think that was, that was part of the--you know, my diversity work and the defibrillator work.
Speaker 1: And also one from the Guidant Corporation?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Guidant, yeah.  That's the group--that's the one that's advertising--no, that was Medtronic [Medtronic Public Limited Company].  Guidant--it was one of the early manufacturers of the defibrillator, so they wanted to give awards to the originals, so they gave me one, and of course Dr. Mirowski [Michel Mirowski] had died by then, and they gave another one to Dr. Mower [Morton Mower], who was working with us also.  But Guidant is a national--they're sort of like Robert Wood Johnson [Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Princeton, New Jersey], or something like that there, a national group.
Story_ID: 588513
Speaker 1: Tell me about the Levi Watkins professorship.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That was quite a surprise.  I got a call one day from Vanderbilt's [Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee] dean, and I didn't know what he wanted; I thought they were just trying to get me to give 'em more money--I contribute to 'em.  And he said, "No."  I guess I said, "What, you want some more money, man?"  And he said, "No."  He said, "The board of trustees has decided to have a lectureship, a professorship, and a deanship in your name."  I said, "Damn."
Speaker 1: That's quite an honor.
Speaker 2: I said, "Damn."  I couldn't believe it.  I just listened to it and, you know, thought about the first days.  He said he thought it would be important to the institution, the black students at the institution, the white students need to see our history.  He said, "You are our history."  He said, "We wanna do that.  Can we do it?"  I said (laughter), "Can you do it?  Of course."  So they did it, and they had the lectureship.  I did the first one and they found different people to do the lectures.  Dave Satcher [HistoryMaker Dr. David Satcher] did the last one.  They have an award, the Levi Watkins Award [Levi Watkins Jr. Student Award], down there; the dean--they found a dean, Dr. George Hill is the Levi Watkins dean; I'm bringing him to speak for us at Hopkins [Johns Hopkins Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland] in a few weeks.  And then they did the portrait, they did the portrait.  Now, those are great honors.  Those made--well, even if they hadn't a done that, it would've been all right, but I must say that made the early days seem like nothing, you know.  Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] used to say, "The arc, the arc of the moral universe is long, but it always leads toward justice."
Speaker 1: Yes indeedy.
Speaker 2: And I think that's what, that's what all that was: justice.
Story_ID: 588514
Speaker 1: Is there anything else you'd like to add--something that we didn't ask today?  Any other honors or some contributions that were highlights of your life (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  No, you hit the highlights.  I can't--you know, daddy's surgery, human defibrillation, diversifying this place, all, all my students all around the country.  No, just--and then having the family I had.  I have an incredible family--sisters and brothers.  I mean they, they have been very supportive and, and, and of course mother [Lillian Varnado Watkins] and father [Levi Watkins, Sr.].  Those, those--all of those things were equally important.  No, I think we've covered--you've covered my life.
Speaker 1: (Laugher) Well, tell me, why did you want to tell your story today?
Speaker 2: Why did I wanna tell it?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It may touch somebody.  I wasn't real--in favor of it at first, to be honest, and I said--but my secretary said, "It sounds very interesting," because I had done a few other things.  But she said, "This sounds very interesting."  But I think if I do anything now, other people can see possibilities; they can see rainbows in the clouds.  That's why I would do it now.  I don't, I don't see much more coming to me; I think I've been blessed.  So, I think, I think people--young people--young people these days, I think they need a whole lot of visible, tangible--see those kind of results and see 'em in people and, and see 'em happen to people who didn't have all these things, you know.  So that's why, that's why.
Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way you lived your life, and what, what's important to you?
Speaker 2: I feel good about that.  I've tried to, tried to be a servant, servant in many different ways.  I tried to be decent; that came from having, you know, the parents that I had.  The only thing I didn't do was get married, and some people say, "You were married to this; you were married to that; you were married to this and that."  I don't know about that, but maybe--and then they say, "You don't have any children."  In reality, I got all kind of children, genetic and non-genetic.  So, I would do it the way I did it; I would come back up through Montgomery [Alabama].  I would go to Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] again.  I went there because daddy was president of Alabama State [Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama], and daddy didn't think I should be at the same school he was at where he was president, and we got the same name.
Speaker 1: He (unclear) do that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I would still go to Tennessee State, we would integrate Vanderbilt [Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee] again (laughter); that would bring--we would come back to Hopkins, we would give them a King program [Martin Luther King Jr. Commemoration], we would give 'em a, a choir [Unified Voices], and human defibrillation (laughter).  No, I think it's, it's--I wouldn't change much, I wouldn't change much (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: I just question whether or not I should have married at some point.
Story_ID: 588515
Speaker 1: For those going into the field of medicine, what suggestions would you have for them?
Speaker 2: Oh, serious--to persevere seriously, and prepare, be patient.  Kids ask me all the time, "How many years did you go to school?"  Be patient, but persevere.  And for the African Americans out there, use, use your talents, use your education to promote many things like the healthcare disparities because when you help that, you help America.  So use that in the process.  Be careful about running your mouth.  There was a great guy named Montague Cobb [William Montague Cobb] at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Montague told me one time, he said, he said, "You know, when you run your mouth, you take blood away from your brain."  He was an anatomist.  He said, "Blood goes to the muscles of your mouth rather than the cerebral cortex."  He said, "When blood doesn't go there, you're subject to say anything from here," (indicates his mouth).  So, I would tell the kids (laughter) be careful when they run their mouths that they don't divert blood from the brain over to the mouth (laughter), but all Montague was saying was just know the place and time, but don't be silent.
Story_ID: 588516
Speaker 1: Is that sort of your hope and concern for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I'm concerned now there's too much silence.  I'm concerned about education.  My biggest concern is the single family.  Fractionated families lead to fractionated communities; fractionated communities lead to drugs and violence and disrespect.  All along I've been talking about my family here; I had a non-fractionated family.  I hope the black community, African American community, can regroup from this family value thing, and I don't mean to strut out the little children that Republicans do when they have conventions, but I mean true family.  But that, that concerns me a lot.  That's why every time I have an opportunity to speak to children, I do that.  And that's why--hopefully, some of 'em will see this or hear this.  I don't know, you know, how you all do things, but I hope some children, or young adults, you know, can just see the story.
Story_ID: 588517
Speaker 1: Today, what are your thoughts about the Civil Rights Movement, and affirmative action?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, I am so glad about the Civil Rights Movement because if it hadn't a been for that, I wouldn't a had my activism, if it hadn't a been for that, I would not have been going to Vanderbilt [Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee]; I'm very happy with that.  I don't like how affirmative action has been vilified; I think it's been vilified.  They use the word, quota to make it sound bad, and of course everybody doesn't want quotas except for their private clubs, except for their private clubs on Charles Street [Baltimore, Maryland], but they don't like quotas, so they vilified affirmative action.  What that does is decreases the number of applicants.  Right now, we're down--eight plus two--we're down 10 to 12 percent applicants, minority applicants going into medical school, and the same could be said for business and law and engineering.  So, I don't like this fake affirmative action, and I really don't like the Bush [President George Walker Bush] administration taking it on.  I think that's ultimate irony.  If anybody knew (unclear) got something on affirmative action, he got it through legacy action.  But, but I think we need it, I think we need it; I know we need it.  If we had more, we wouldn't have these healthcare disparities I was telling you about.  We would have more caring doctors.  Many times, people go to doctors of their own color and, and that's all right.  Hispanics go to Hispanics; they know--the culture and the communication, I think, is better.  It doesn't have to be that way.  Most of my patients are white, but I have a whole host of black people that come to me just because of that, the way we talk, the way we relate.  So, I'm disappointed at what they--this, this, this vilification of, of affirmative action.  And, of course, you can tell by now I am not a conservative in any way, form, or fashion, so I'm glad we had the Civil Rights Movement.  I regret that we lost so many people, thousands, all for doing what was in the [U.S.] Constitution all along.  So I'm gone stay activist, I will stay talking, I will still ridicule the neo-cons and all this conservative crap.  I will, I will accept all speaking engagements that let me say what I want to say (laughter).  But I believe in all people, though, deeply.
Story_ID: 588518
Speaker 1: We talked about the church a lot as you, as you did your interview.  What do you think about the role of religion in the African American community?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm getting nervous about, about this.  I'm worrying, quite frankly, that the church is leaving me; I'm not leaving the church, I'm, I'm concerned about this--you go to the church, preacher won't even know who you are.  I hear more money prayer than, than prayer-prayer.  I'm concerned about that.  I hear more about God and the devil than I hear about justice and feeding the poor.  Some of the churches, I don't think they would know Jesus if Jesus came by and smacked 'em in the face.  So, I'm a little concerned about that, I'm a little concerned about that.  But maybe I'm from a different church, a church where the pastor knew who you were, a church where the pastor came around at death, at sickness, weddings, and so forth; a church where the pastor knew who was in his audience.  You can probably tell I'm not big on the megachurch.  Right now, they got bodyguards for nothing.  Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] didn't have a bodyguard, nor did he have a limousine or an airplane.  I'm concerned about that, very concerned, so I'm having more church at home now.  My father [Levi Watkins, Sr.] used to say, "I'd rather see a sermon than hear one any day."  So, I'm trying to see a sermon and act a sermon.
Story_ID: 588519
Speaker 1: When you look back, what stands out the most?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Mom [Lillian Varnado Watkins] and dad [Levi Watkins, Sr.], the grands, the fun we had as a family.  Dad did take us on rides to get milkshakes on Sundays.  And then seeing all of us mature, and then get old enough to retire.  It's an amazing transition to go from, from Santa Claus to retirement (laughter).  So all of that has--is for me, I just look at it all as a, as a big form of life and, and it's been good.
Speaker 1: What values do you consider most important, and why?
Speaker 2: Faith, 'cause I do believe all things are possible with faith.  Honesty, I get so tired of lying, and all this lying we hear these days in our government and also individuals.  Honesty, faith.  I think you do need to be--I used this earlier--you do need to be a servant; take your little talents and serve.  Openness, openness to, to change and to people different from yourself, religions different from yourself.  Don't think you're the only one that knows what government we should have, or what religion we should have--just openness.  And then standing strong for what you believe.  I think if young people can get some of that--even two or three of 'em--it will serve them well.
Story_ID: 588520
Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?  What do you--would you like for people to say about you?
Speaker 2: Tried to make a difference, tried to be a good servant, tried to use his talents, and always found a rainbow.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is that the message you would like--and lessons you'd like to leave with the children today?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 588521
Speaker 1: Why do you think history's important?
Speaker 2: It keeps you from repeating things, very important.  It gives you knowledge, lets you know where you came from.  In my desk there, on my desk, a lady gave--once I got to be a professor and a dean [at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland], she brought me some dirt and cotton.  The dirt she got was from Alabama; the cotton was also from Alabama.  She said, "This is to always remind you of your history."  And it's sitting in there right now, a little thing.  People don't know what it is--it's cotton and dirt.  So, history, just to let you know where you came from.  Anybody that doesn't know their history will hardly have a future; they live in the present, live in the present.  So I think history is very important 'cause if you do history, you'll see history makers.
Speaker 1: Yes, you will.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 588522
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Diversity.  Diversity, embracing diversity across the board, you know, across the board.  Having done this defibrillator stuff, touching a million people with their lives and, and I'm sure will be a million more, and being, as they say, being faithful to my family and my God.
Story_ID: 588523
Speaker 1: We spoke about--you spoke about children, and we as educators, end up having a lot of children.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What do you--when they come and talk to you individually, what do you usually tell them as they, as they're getting out and getting ready to move on with their careers?
Speaker 2: Oh, encouragement.  I just had a little girl, Emily [ph.], she's a little sixteen year old white girl.  I know her mother and father, and she's about to go into--she wants to be a doctor.  They wanted her to come to my office and just sit down and talk, and this was last week.  And I was telling her about keeping her options open, getting her ducks in order, persevering, keeping her legs closed--talked to her about faith.  We talked a lot; we talked a lot.  You know, a sixteen year--this day and age, the sixteen year olds they--
Speaker 1: Very mature.
Speaker 2: --they grown, or think they grown.  But they come to the office a lot.  People just want me to talk to their, to their children.  Some wanna be doctors, some wanna be nurses, some just--some are--got lost or strayed, and they just want their children, their children just to get back on track.  And people, some people think I can do that, and I do it a lot.
Speaker 1: What, what, what would you say to a student that is lost and sort of was trying to find their way at this point?
Speaker 2: The first thing I would say, they would have to find their anchor; they've got to have an anchor--an anchor and a belief in something, and I mean religious.  That's the first thing, principles, because that will dictate all the other things: violence, drugs, this and that, promiscuity.  That's the first thing is the, the anchor.  And once they got the anchor, then they can build their other anchors--education--must have education, and I don't care how many degrees they have, but just get a degree in something, and then build on the degree.  And then also just know that they are somebody--that you don't have to know--when they get that anchor, they will know they are somebody because--I don't know who said this: "Because God didn't make no junk," [Ethel Waters].  I tell that to 'em all the time.
Speaker 1: All the time, um-hm. If a student is not doing very well in your class, in the classes that you--when you were teaching, what do you--do you talk to them individually, do you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Talk to 'em individually and tutor.
Speaker 1: And tutor.
Speaker 2: Tutor.  I do the tutoring, or we find somebody to tutor them.  We try to do anything to keep 'em from falling off.  At this medical school [Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland], we have very few students, very few students that just fail.  That's not to say we don't have a few that get into trouble, but personal tutoring and collective tutoring is something real big for me personally, and also for my colleagues, yeah.  If they fail, something else is going on.  For most of the students that get into this medical school are, are bright, so if they fail, something, something else is getting on--going on in their lives, and you have to find that out.
Speaker 1: In your travels, and as you talk, do you find that students don't seem to be as interested in college as they used to be?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't, and I have to say that--maybe not, because when I go to places, it's often colleges, and it is always packed.  But, but looking at college admission rates, I think that may be true.  And also, we know for sure though, the number of people interested in sciences is down.  So, I work on a group called CollegeBound [CollegeBound Foundation, Baltimore, Maryland]; that's another foundation.  And we try to get these kids to college financially and academically, and they seem to be doing pretty well.  So I don't know how to answer that correctly.  I am concerned about the number, or the lack of interest in sciences.
Speaker 1: In sciences, okay.  All right, well I'd like to thank you for your interview today, and like I say, is there anything else that you'd like to say that we have not--that you have not said?
Speaker 2: I think we've covered it all, Janet [HistoryMaker Janet L. Sims-Wood], and thank you, and thank you, Matt [Matthew Hickey], and I hope all this comes out, and let me know whatever you need to do and when this--where this will be (laughter).
