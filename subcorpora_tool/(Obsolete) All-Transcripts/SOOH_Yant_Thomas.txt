 Higgins Today is Thursday, July 31, 2014. My name is Jason Higgins, and I   m an  intern with the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at the OSU  Library. I   m in Stillwater at the OSU Library to interview Thomas Yant  to discuss his experiences as a Navy Seabee during the Vietnam War.  This is part of the Spotlighting Oklahoma oral history project. Mr. Yant,  thank you for joining me today.  Yant You   re welcome.  Higgins Let   s begin with when and where you were born.  Yant I was born in Ponca City, Oklahoma, in 1944, September 7, 1944.  Higgins Tell me a little bit about your parents.  Yant My father was  manager  of the Western Union office in Ponca City. He  was also a realtor on the side. He established a laundromat in Ponca City,  which my family ran. My mother worked at the laundromat. She was also  a seamstress and a housekeeper.  Higgins Do you have brothers or sisters?  Yant Yes, I   ve got a brother who is three years younger than I am.  Higgins Did you pick on your little brother growing up at all?  Yant Of course. (Laughter)  Higgins Tell me a little bit about Ponca City, growing up during that era.  Yant Ponca City was mainly a Conoco town, and a big part of the population  worked at Conoco. At that time, they advertised having around three  5  thousand employees, just Conoco. It was a nice town. They had a lot of  good friends and pretty good schools, I think.  Higgins What did you do for fun growing up? Were you involved in Boy Scouts  or sports at all?  Yant No, not really. You know, I spent most of my time working at the family  laundry, and for fun, went fishing and shooting and swimming.  Higgins Tell me a little bit about school. Did you have any favorite subjects or  anything?  Yant Well, not particularly. I had one government subject that I did fairly well  in, and I was kind of proud of and enjoyed it. Overall, there   s nothing that  particularly stands out, other than that.  Higgins Was Ponca City High a large school?  Yant Yes, it was. I think there was around close to five hundred in our  graduating class, I believe.  Higgins What year did you graduate?  Yant This was in 1962.  Higgins Tell me a little bit about going through high school during a lot of the  Cold War era. Do you recall a lot of the Kennedy speeches during that  time or anything of that nature?  Yant Not so much. I recall him, of course, running for president. I wasn   t that  much interested in politics at that time. Of course, I recall the Cold War  tensions and all and, of course, the Cuban Missile Crisis that came later.  At the time I was in high school why, that was pretty far from my mind.  Higgins Were there any nuclear drills or anything like that in school?  Yant In grade school, we had some. You know, you   d get under the desk or go  to the halls for different things. People in the 1950s built storm shelters     not storm shelters. They were actually fallout shelters at that time. They  were good for avoiding tornadoes, too, but the sales pitch was for atomic  attack. They all looked pretty much alike, all round, dome-shaped  shelters that people put in their backyards. We didn   t have one, but a lot  of folks did.  Higgins Were there any tornadoes in the area of Ponca City growing up?  6  Yant Yeah, in, I believe it was 1953, there was a tornado. It didn   t come  through Ponca City, but it blew away the northeast part of Blackwell,  which is just sixteen miles away, probably about twelve miles, as the  crow flies, from Ponca City.  Higgins Did your parents ever encourage you to go to college or anything of that  nature?  Yant They did. They didn   t push it particularly, but they did encourage it. I  wanted to go to get some kind of education, so I considered going to NOC   Northern Oklahoma College . I didn   t really consider OSU because it  was so big. Of course, it   s big now, but it was big back then, too. I wanted  a smaller school I   d feel more comfortable in.  Higgins I see.  Yant I wound up going to a small church-related school up in Emporia, Kansas,  College of Emporia, which, it closed in about 1971 or 1972. I went one  semester up there and didn   t do particularly well, so I left. It was a good  experience. I made some good friends, friends that I   ve recently made  new contact with. The fellow that lived across the hall from me was from  Cyprus, and he came home with me on the train at Thanksgiving in 1962  and spent the weekend with us. Then after I left school up there, we lost  contact. A year or two ago, no, actually, it was just a little over a year, I  guess, I found him by way of the internet and wrote to him. We  established contact, and the last September, my wife and I went and  visited with him and his wife in Cincinnati, Ohio. It was a real nice time.  Higgins After Emporia, did you go to any further education?  Yant Yeah. When I left Emporia, I was kind of at odds as to what to do. I went  to work with my dad at the Western Union in Ponca City just delivering  messages for a little while, just kind of to fill in until I decided what I  wanted to do. He had literature there. There   s company literature about  the microwave business, as microwaves were becoming a big thing back  then, and I was reading about that. I had a friend going to Okmulgee to  Oklahoma State Tech, it was called back then, in Okmulgee. I checked.  They had a program in electronics, and I got interested in that. I enrolled  over there and finished a two-year program but couldn   t keep up with the  math for the electronic program. I went to the electrical maintenance  program in industrial electrical maintenance, and I got a certificate in  that. I got two certificates in electrical maintenance and graduated in  1965.  Higgins Were you a bachelor during this time?  7  Yant Yes. Yeah. Of course, I knew that I was living under the threat of the  draft, and the only thing keeping me out of the draft was going to school.  (Laughs) When I left school there, why, I got a job at the Ralston Purina  Company in Fort Worth. Of course, being an electrician, I expected to do  electrical work, and it was a non-union company down there. There  wasn   t a lot of electrical work to do at that time, so I did mostly just grunt  work, labor, and didn   t do any electrical work at all. After about three or  four weeks of that, I decided that I might as well go ahead and join the  military and get it over with, so I went back to Ponca City and joined the  Navy.  Higgins You volunteered for the Navy?  Yant I volunteered for the Navy and went back to finish up my last week of  work in Fort Worth, and while I was there, I got my draft notice.  (Laughter) I just avoided the draft by just a few days. Yeah, I went back  to Ponca City and signed up and was sent to boot camp in San Diego.  When classification day came, I was unsure as to what I was going to do.  I kind of thought I might be an electrician on the ship or something,  electrician   s mate or something like that. The guy asked me if I   d thought  about the Seabees, and he said if I wanted to join the Seabees, why, he  could get me a bump in rate. I   d go from an E1 to an E3 and avoid an E2  rating. It   d be a bump in paygrade.  I decided that sounded pretty good, so that   s what I did. I joined the  Seabees and was sent to Port Hueneme, California. I was assigned to  MCB Ten, which is Mobile Construction Battalion. Sent to California, to  Port Hueneme, and we did some training there. I did some, had done  various pole climbing and radio communications, some of it. Some of us  had to operate radios. I went through communications training and  learned how, kind of a shorthand for taking communications on radio and  telephone. I learned how to use the telephone system and whatnot. All  the electronics at that time, radio and telephone, was mostly all leftover  from Korea and World War II. It was all that era equipment.  Higgins Tell me a little bit about basic training. What was emphasized during that  time?  Yant Basic training, it was mostly classes. We had some drill work, and they  issued us rifles that didn   t have firing pins in them, you know, just for  drill training. We also had calisthenics, but we also did things like, we  had fire training. That was a day or two of pretty intense fire training,  which we didn   t have any protective gear at that time, breathing apparatus  or anything. They had mock ship compartments that they would flood  with fuel and set it on fire, and we had to go in and fight the fire. That  was pretty extensive training, and outside, using foam on the fires that  8  might occur on an aircraft carrier or something, putting fires out in the  tank or on a deck.  Then we went to a firing range, to fire. A lot of it was classroom training,  too. They had a mock ship, and we went on the shipboard and went  through different drills that they have on the ship. That   s basically what  it was about. It was a lot of shoe shining and washing our clothes. We  had concrete tables out on the lot that we used Wisk detergent and a scrub  brush to wash our clothes and hang them on the clothesline with ties. We  had little cords that we tied our clothes to the clothesline every night, and  we all had to take turns standing watch in the barracks and around camp,  around base. You spent watch inside and outside, and one night, I spent  watch at the brig. That was basically it. It was a lot of yelling. (Laughter)  Higgins During your time training as a Seabee, how, in your mind, what was the  probability that you were going to Vietnam?  Yant It was a 100 percent because the battalion I joined had just got back from  there. The MCB Ten was the first battalion in Vietnam. They made a  beach landing at Chu Lai in 1966 and established an airfield there, and  that was really early in the war. When they got back from Chu Lai in  December, that   s when I joined. Actually, I joined them in January, right  after New Year   s Day in January. They had just gotten back in December.  The Seabees would go over. They   d spend eight or nine months there,  and they   d come back and regroup, get new equipment, retrain and get  new people and old people would leave. Then they   d go back.  Higgins How did you prepare mentally for going to Vietnam?  Yant I don   t know. It was not knowing what we were getting into. Some of the  other guys had already been there. My first time, I didn   t really know  what to expect too much. It turns out my tour was pretty easy, but going  in there, we had no idea what to expect.  Higgins Did you communicate with your family during that time before you  deployed?  Yant Oh yeah, yeah, telephone. Sure did.  Higgins How did your family react to the possibility   ?  Yant Well, they knew where I was going. They were devastated by it, but there  was no choice. It never occurred to me to skip out and go to Canada or  something trying to avoid it. It was just something that I felt like I needed  to do to serve the country. Everybody did it back then, and I felt like I  needed to be a part of that.  9  Higgins How did you get to Vietnam?  Yant We left in flights out of Point Mugu, a naval air station, on C-141   s. We  flew over on C-141   s. My flight, we took off and flew, and we got about  halfway there or so. I don   t recall how long it was. They had  communication that it was storming really bad in Da Nang  Vietnam ,  and they stopped in Wake Island in the middle of the night. I don   t know  if they had to, I don   t think they had to refuel because those planes could  fly across the Pacific without refueling. We stopped in Wake Island and  spent a couple of hours in the night, reloaded, and then they flew us to  Yokota, Japan. We got to Yokota about daybreak and had breakfast at the  Air Force base there and then reloaded and flew into Da Nang, Da Nang  Air Field.  Higgins What were your impressions upon arriving at Da Nang?  Yant It had been raining, and it was wet, humid. I don   t recall it being  overbearingly hot, but it was still fairly early in the morning. They loaded  us on cattle trucks and took us to our camp, which was Camp Hoover. It  was located at the base of Hill 327. We got there. We were assigned our  quarters. We had strong back tents, at that time, with canvas covers on  them, and we were there for a couple of days. Then on the next weekend,  why, we got nice metal roofs to make huts out of them. They were built  up off the ground and with screen wire all the way around them, then that  metal roof, and it had flaps to put down during rainstorms.  Higgins What were your assignments?  Yant In Port Hueneme, I was assigned to Bravo Company. When I got to  Vietnam, they reassigned me to Headquarters Company, S-2 division,  and put me in communications. My main job was in the command post  bunker, which is an underground bunker, working telephone switchboard  and radio, making announcements on camp. We had a PA system in  camp, made announcements. Mainly radio and telephone  communications. We worked six on, twelve off in the bunker, and shared  a few shifts. Then we   d have a few days on topside, working topside,  stringing wire, fixing problems with the telephone lines topside, and that  meant climbing poles and climbing through concertina wire. Wires ran  across the camp on telephone poles, on the concrete poles, but when it  got to the edge of the camp, why, it ran down through the concertina wire  from one post to the next, out post. We had bunkers on the edge of the  camp. They all had sound-powered phones in them, and we could  communicate back and forth with them by telephone.  Higgins What did you guys do during your time off?  10  Yant Time off, we had an enlisted men   s club there. It was a bamboo building  with a thatched roof on it. It served beer, and they had slot machines in  there. People just sit around and talked. Some people played the slots all  the time. I never put a nickel in it. (Laughter) We   d just sit around and  drink beer, and had movies. The only movie that I remember seeing over  there was a TV war, made-for-TV war movies. (Laughter) There was a  combat series that was big back then, and they   d show those movies. We  sat there and watched. It was outside. When it was raining, why, we   d  put the flap up on the tent and set, put our chairs under the tent flap with  our back to the hooch and watch the movie on the side of the building.  Higgins Did you interact with civilians during your time in Vietnam?  Yant Very little. No, no, no, I didn   t. We had very few civilians in camp. There  were a few, not many civilians that worked in camp, but I had very low  contact with civilians.  Higgins What were your impressions of the ones you did have contact with, as far  as their standard of living?  Yant They were just there doing a job, and like I say, I had very little contact  with them. I really don   t have too much to say about them because I just  didn   t have that much interaction with them.  Higgins Tell me about a typical day on the job.  Yant Like I say, it was six on, twelve off. You eat and go to the bunker and  man the telephones, and any radio communications that had to be made,  we made those to various places. It was kind of, the bunker became rat  infested and roaches. Lot of big roaches in there and rats, but you   d get  to where you ignored them and go on. Pretty secure in the bunker,  working in the bunker, but when the time came to work topside, well,  then of course we were climbing poles. We were targets for whoever  wanted to make us a target on our poles, but that was part of the job. I  never got shot at or anything.  Higgins Was there a fear of snipers or mortar attack?  Yant There were some, yeah, oh yeah. Yeah, there was some pretty hot activity  in our area, but it wasn   t so close to us that we had to be, you know, that  we   we had our firearms with us. We were issued M-14   s. That   s what  we trained with, M-14   s, at Port Hueneme. We had M-14   s, but we never  had to get them out and arm ourselves. The only shot I heard fired over  there was one of the guys came in drunk one night in the hooch across  from us and loaded and fired a round or two through the overhead in  11  camp. (Laughter) That was our own guy. Of course, it scared everybody,  thinking it might be something going on, but it didn   t take long to find  out it was just a drunk in camp. We didn   t have anything that would really  make us fearful in camp. Most of the time, it was just, we were pretty laid  back. Everything   s going along.  There was about a month there, I don   t recall now when it was. It was in  November or December. There was about a month there that there was a  lot of activity in our area. They sent aircraft flying. There was a, seemed  like it was a rice field or something between our camp and Da Nang. I  don   t know. It must have been two or three miles to Da Nang from where  we were. For about a month, every night at dusk, they started dropping  flares over that area. The aircraft would just fly slow over that area  shooting flares out, and they would parachute down and kept the whole  area lit up for about a month. You could read a newspaper out there at  night, there were so many flares.  It was kind of fun to sit out there and watch the flares come down. You,  of course, hoping that they don   t find somebody out there, but if there   s  somebody out there, we did want them to find them. It was kind of fun to  sit out there and watch the flares float down and watch the patterns that  they make as they floated down, the shadows. It was kind of an eerie  feeling, but it was kind of pretty, too. (Laughs)  Higgins It seems like it would be hard to sleep. (Laughter)  Yant Well, no, you get to where you can sleep through about anything,  especially when you have the tin roof. When the rains come, why, it beats  down on it, but after a while, you get to so you can sleep through about  anything.  Higgins How was sanitation during that time in camp?  Yant It was good. We first got there, they had a, kind of a wooden bridge built  across the creek that ran through the camp and had showers set up on  that. Then they built later, a little bit later, they built closed-in showers,  and they had toilets with a, that used a half of a fifty-five-gallon drum.  Put diesel fuel in it. I don   t know. It seemed like it was about six or eight  holes in each toilet, and put these drums up there. That   s what you used.  Every morning, why, there   d be a crew, a honey bucket crew. They had  to go out and pull them out, and they   d stack those buckets up and burn  them and replace them. It was sanitary.  Higgins Were you on that camp your entire stay during Vietnam?  12  Yant Yeah, I was. I left one time to go to a beach party. We had a beach party  and went down to the beach and spent a Sunday afternoon at the beach.  Other than that, that was pretty much it. While I was there, why, one of  my friends had wintered over in Antarctic. He was telling tales about that,  and I thought,    Well, that sounds better than Vietnam.    (Laughter) I  applied to winter over at Antarctic and put in the paperwork for it.  They called me, and I went down the road. The 3rd Marine Division was  down the road from us at that time. They eventually moved out, and the  1st Marine came in. I went down there at Charlie Medical Battalion and  got a physical and all that and did everything I had to do to apply for it,  but I didn   t get accepted.  I went back about my business, and I got to writing letters to my girlfriend  that I   d had back home, earlier. We got to writing back and forth.  Eventually we had decided, through letters, we   d get married when I got  back, so that was kind of nice. When we did get back, why, I got married.  Higgins You proposed through a letter?  Yant Through a letter.  Higgins How long did it take to get your reply?  Yant I don   t recall offhand. The letters came and went pretty good. Seemed  like the mail took about a week, so it might have been ten days. Part of  the delay in the reply was her mother didn   t like me anymore after we   d  broken up before, and her mother didn   t want to give her the letter.  (Laughter) She kept the letter from her for a couple days before she  finally gave it to her, but I got a positive response from her. She accepted,  so that gave me something to look forward to when we got home.  Higgins Tell me a little bit about the beach party. I   ve heard of them, and I   ve  read of them.  Yant Why, we just swam. They just took some grills out there and charcoaled  steaks. We had steaks. We ate really, really well in the Seabees at our  base, and they fed us really good. Every Sunday, we had steaks. Dinner  on Sunday, they barbequed steaks in camp, but this particular Sunday,  why, they moved the charcoalers out there. We went to the beach and had  our steaks and beer party and swam in the ocean. That   s about all it  amounted to.  Higgins You hear a lot of associations with Vietnam, especially in the rear areas,  with a lot of drug use. Did you ever experience that?  13  Yant No, I didn   t. Of course, I was over there early enough. I don   t know that  that got to be such a big deal until later in the    60s, but I didn   t know  anybody that did drugs. We all smoked. Everybody smoked. If anybody  was smoking marijuana, I had no clue. (Laughs)  Higgins At what point did you realize the anti-war demonstrations back home?  Yant Oh, while I was there, I don   t recall it being so much. Of course, back  then, there was so much going on back here anyway. Other than anti-war,  there was desegregation, and it was all that mixed in with it. It   s kind of  hard to sort it all out. I took a paper from my hometown. Ponca City News  sent me papers over there. I   d get papers, but I don   t recall it being that  big a deal in my mind at that time. My main concern was getting my tour  done and getting home safe. (Laughs)  Higgins Absolutely. Was there any unrest while you were in Vietnam, as far as  civil rights? I realize it was a little early for the Black Power Movement,  but did you integrate well with African American soldiers in the Seabees?  Yant I don   t recall there being any problem in our group. I really don   t. There  weren   t that many black Seabees there. There were some, but we didn   t  have any in our hooch. There was about ten to a hooch, but I don   t recall  there being any problem with them. I   ve never had any problems with  them.  Higgins How long were you in Vietnam?  Yant I was there from May of    66 to the last day, it was about the last day of  January of    67.  Higgins Was there any memorable episodes, anything you want to share, any day  that was funny or anything like that?  Yant No, not particularly. We just worked hard all the time. It was six on,  twelve off. You kind of lose track of the days. There was times when we  worked around the clock. We decided to rewire the camp, and we worked  around the clock for about three days doing that.  Higgins Did you get paid extra for being in a combat area?  Yant Yeah, we got combat pay. There was obvious things going on. One of the  things we did in the bunker when we were on duty was to call out the  mortar crews. When the Marines found something going on out there and  they needed illumination, why, they called us, and then we provided  illumination for them. Our mortar crews would go out and shoot mortar  14  shells with illumination out over the areas the Marines wanted, and that  happened nearly every night. It was just, it was that close to us.  We were sitting in the EM  enlisted men   s  club. Hill 327   s right here,  and there was a Hawk missile site on top of it. There were times when  there would be cannon fire, and we could hear rounds going over it, you  know, from one area to the other right over us. You could hear it going  over, but we weren   t the targets. (Laughs)  Higgins It seems that that kind of atmosphere could lead to a lot of anxiety. Could  you speak to that?  Yant It could. There was anxiety, I suppose, but we stayed busy. That   s the  way we worked through it, just staying busy. Working six on, twelve off,  you don   t have much time for anything else. You get a little bit of time  for yourself, go drink some beer, you know, and watch a movie and  whatnot and write letters, but we stayed pretty busy.  Higgins Did you carry any good luck charms or anything like that?  Yant No. Well, our pastor in Ponca City gave me a little cross, a Celtic cross.  I wore that on my dog tags, but that   s all I had.  Higgins Tell me about coming back home. How did you arrive in the United  States?  Yant We came back on C-141   s, a nonstop flight from Da Nang back to  California to Point Mugu Naval Air Station. We landed there. Port  Hueneme is just right close by there. We bussed over to Port Hueneme  and checked in and checked our guns in, and I recall it. It was a day or  two. We had to do some administrative work there, I guess. I don   t recall  exactly what all we did do before they turned us loose, and then it goes  to thirty-day leave.  Higgins What did you do?  Yant I went home, and parents and my future wife met me at the airport in  Oklahoma City. We drove to Ponca City. By a week later, why, we were  married. (Laughs)  Higgins Where did you get married?  Yant We got married at the Presbyterian church in Ponca City.  Higgins Did you go on a honeymoon?  15  Yant We went on a short honeymoon. Went down into North Texas and visited  some of my relatives down there and went on down into mid-Texas and  back.  Higgins After your thirty days, you rejoined the Seabees?  Yant Well, yeah, I sure did. In fact, see, my wife was off. She had about week  or so off for getting married and a honeymoon. She had to go back to  work. She worked at Conoco. She was a keypunch operator at Conoco. I  had two or three weeks there to kill with my folks, and we had time after  she got off work and then had some time with my folks and whatnot.  Yeah, at the end of the thirty days, I went back to Port Hueneme, and we  started regrouping and getting ready to go back to Vietnam.  While I was there, I got orders to another base, to a naval communications  station in Australia. It was orders that I could accept or not. If I accepted  it, I could accept it as an eighteen-month single tour, unaccompanied tour,  or I could take my wife and it would be a twenty-four-month tour. I called  her and asked her if she was interested, and she said,    Sure, anything.     (Laughs) Of course I was interested. If I didn   t have to go back to  Vietnam, that sounded pretty good to me, but I didn   t want to necessarily  go there without her for eighteen months. She had never been away from  home. That was on the other side of the world, you know, her first time  away from home, but she was game, that she wanted to do it.  They cut my orders for a leave. I got another thirty-day leave to get ready  to go to Australia. We applied for a passport, which didn   t come in time,  but we made our preparations. The time came. We   d bought a new car,  and I drove the car to Travis Air Force Base. No, actually, I drove the car  somewhere there (I forgot where it was) for shipping and then went to  Travis Air Force Base. Maybe I may have turned it in to Travis. I don   t  recall off hand, but they shipped the car over there for us. Then at Travis,  I spent the night, and then they loaded me on a C-124 for a flight to  Australia. It was about a ten-hour flight  to Hawaii . (Laughs) It was a  prop plane. It flies just under three hundred miles an hour.  It was a long flight to Hawaii. We landed at Hickam Air Force Base and  had a fifteen-hour crew rest there, and then we got back on it. They had  taken some of the passengers off, and there were retired people and other  passengers on there. We just had jump seats. It was a cargo plane. All we  had was the jump seats up and down the sides and cargo down the middle.  They had taken some of the passengers off and put a cargo of liquid  oxygen on board, and we took off and got about thirty minutes out and  had an engine quit. We came back, and then we spent another fifteen  hours while they put another engine on the plane.  16  When they did that, they took the liquid oxygen off. I don   t know if they  went ahead and sent it on another plane or what, but then they put those  passengers back on. Anyway, we took off again and flew to Pago Pago  and had a fifteen-hour crew rest there. Saw a little bit of Pago Pago and  got a hotel there and got a few hours    sleep. Then from there, we flew to  Christchurch, New Zealand, and we had another crew rest there. Spent  some time in New Zealand.  I   d met one of the people on the plane who was a teacher. He had actually  been to Ponca City, and I think his name was Jim Shape. He had been a  teacher, and he was retired from military, taken a hop. We walked around  Christchurch and saw some of the sights in Christchurch, New Zealand.  He wanted to go to a school there, so we went and visited a school and  got there at tea time. At that time, Christchurch, they said New Zealand  was more British than England was at that time. They had their high tea  and all. We got there in time for tea and had a nice visit with the faculty  of this school and went back and spent a little time in a pub and got a  couple hours of sleep. Then got back on the plane and flew to Australia  from Christchurch, New Zealand. I don   t know how long that flight was.  Pretty long flight, too, but it wasn   t as long as the others.  We landed in Richmond, Australia at the Royal Air Force Base there. I  asked around there, and they had no idea how I was going to get to where  I was going. My duty station was on Northwest Cape, Australia, which is  a little cape of land that sticks out in the Indian Ocean. It was a  communication station. They had a very low frequency transmitter there  to transmit to the subs, and the subs could receive underwater the very  low frequency transmissions. It was located in Exmouth at Northwest  Cape, and they had no idea how I was going to get there. I don   t think  they   d even heard of it, if I recall correctly. They suggested that what I  needed to do was go into Sydney to the American consulate.  I grabbed a cab, and he drove me, I don   t know where all he took me.  Finally, I got onto a train, and the train got me into downtown Sydney,  come in the subway in Sydney. Got to Sydney right at noon, and the  sidewalks were just full of people. It seemed like every direction I tried  to go they were going the other way. (Laughs) Anyway, I walked around  after lunch. I didn   t eat at that time. I wanted to wait, and I thought I   d  just eat at the airport. I got to the consulate, and they got me orders to  Perth, an airplane ticket to Perth. I went to the airport and waited for my  flight and got that plane to Perth. It   s nonstop flight from Sydney to Perth.  You got to Perth. The American consulate in Perth put me up in a hotel.  Higgins Did your wife join you in the hotel?  17  Yant No, she didn   t have her passport yet. It hadn   t come yet. We had made  the mistake of applying for a free passport, and that was the result of it.  She was still working and waiting for her passport.  Higgins Were there other crewmen with you going to that next location?  Yant While I was in the hotel there, I met one of the guys that had been a  bunkmate in Vietnam, Rick Grenon, and he   d gotten orders there, too.  We just run into each other. I had no idea. One of the guys from the  council house kind of showed us around. We went around Perth, kind of  barhopped a little bit, and spent, oh, a day or two in Perth and saw a  movie. Then they sent us to Exmouth, and the flight was through  Learmonth Air Force Base. It was a Royal Australian Air Force Base  during World War II. It was just a tiny little strip out there with a couple  buildings around it, and it was about halfway down the cape. We landed  at Learmonth, and there was nothing there. Of course, there was  somebody to meet us, and we flew up there in a DC-3. We got taxied into  Exmouth, and after that, it was pretty much kind of a blur as to what  happened then. I checked into the master-at-arms and got set up in the  barracks, and they showed me around.  There were three areas there, well, four, I guess, if you count downtown.  Out on the tip of the peninsula was an antennae field. This was Area A,  and there were thirteen antennas out there. Twelve were in a circle, and  the center antenna was the tallest. At that time, it was the tallest manmade  structure in the southern hemisphere. I forgot how tall it was, but it was  way on up there. There was a large power plant there, and that was the  VLF  very low frequency  transmitting site there. Then a few miles back  was the base where we all lived, the non-married people lived, anyway,  in the base. Then a couple miles on back up the cape from the base was  the town of Exmouth, which is a small little town there just getting, it was  just kind of coming into being at that time. They had all new houses and  everything. This whole thing had just been completed. The entire station  had just been completed. Seemed like it was between the base and town,  there was a high-frequency transmitter site.  They had their antennas, and their transmitter was there. Then from on  inland, from town, it was about thirty-five miles inland to where I worked  was Area, they called Area C. It was a high-frequency receiver site, and  we had a large antenna field out there also, all in a circle, with fire breaks  around it. In the center of that was the receiver building, and then we had  a power plant, which was where I was operating, I was to operate. We  had four 175-kilowatt diesel generators in there, and then a water  treatment plant was close by. We operated a water treatment plant for that  area, kept the water available there. We drew our own water and treated  it, stored it for the site. The power plant, of course, had a large storage  18  for diesel fuel for the power plant. It was all brand new. When I was taken  out there, the contractor was still there, and he went over it with us and  showed us how everything worked. All the plans were still there and  everything. In a short time, they turned it over to us, and we took shifts  working at that power plant and keeping the power going for the receiver  site.  Higgins Tell me a little bit about the community with your wife and the others  living on base.  Yant After a few weeks, my wife arrived. She got her orders. It was kind of  nice in that communication there. My father, being the manager of the  Western Union in Ponca City, he got all of his telegrams free, and we  could send them free to him. We had that communication. It was kind of  nice to be able to just send wires back and forth, and he told me how she  was, kind of kept me updated on her status and when she was coming.  The day she arrived was kind of a surprise. I was expecting her to be there  the next day, and she got there a day early. She arrived in Perth, and there  was a delay in their flight. I guess it wasn   t supposed to be in for another  day, and somehow a seat opened up. They put her on it.  She arrived, and I was there on base doing something, I don   t recall now.  They called and said she was down at the bus station. It was kind of a bus  station there. It seemed like it was a weekly bus or something that came.  From the cape to Perth was eight hundred miles, so we were way out. The  last ninety miles from the cape, from I think down that coast was, I think  Geraldton came first, and then from Perth on north was Geraldton and  then Carnarvon and then Exmouth. The last ninety miles to the cape was  dirt road.  Higgins How many other families were living on base?  Yant Well, the families, married housing was in town, in Exmouth. Military  built the housing, but that   s where the married, their accompanied  housing was. We lived in town, but on the base, there were barracks there.  I don   t recall how many people were there. The town, in town, there  wasn   t, I think the whole place was less than twenty-five hundred of us,  maybe less than two thousand.  Higgins Did your wife take employment in the town?  Yant No, she didn   t. She kept house. We had no telephone and no television  out there because there just wasn   t any. I had a radio that I   d bought in  Vietnam that had a shortwave band on it, and we could get a little bit of  shortwave that way sometimes. We listened to the moon landing on it.  She was a housekeeper. The house that we were assigned was a brand-  19  new house that had never been lived in and had Danish modern furniture  in it, two bedrooms, washer and dryer, frontload Westinghouse washer  and dryer, and an electric range. It was a concrete block house with an  air-conditioner on top of it. It had a concrete roof on it. It was supposed  to be hurricane-proof. The only problem with that was that it was built  right down on the ground. (Laughs) It wasn   t built up where water  couldn   t come in the front door, but it was built to be hurricane-proof. It  had shutters on the windows, and it was a nice house.  The summers were really hot. There was one day I was out mowing and  stopped to rest and looked at the thermometer. It was 117 degrees in the  shade, and of course, that was probably December or January down there  because being down there, the seasons are opposite what they are up here.  The yard was just all bare pindan. They call that soil pindan. It was just  a gritty dirt that compacts into a kind of clay. We had to put in a lawn and  managed to get a little bit of a lawn made. I did borrow a push mower  from the military and mowed the yard once in a while.  She had worked all of her life and had not much experience cooking or  anything and housekeeping, so that gave her the opportunity to do it. She  made friends with all the ladies around there, and they kind of leaned on  each other. She kind of kept the same hours that I did. Down there, I  worked twelve hours, twelve on, twenty-four off for three shifts, and then  I got three days off. She kept the same hours that I did. Of course, I had  to leave real early. It was a long drive out to Area C, about a thirty-five-mile  drive, and the speed limit was thirty-five miles an hour. (Laughter)  She baked all of our bread. I got down there, and it was kind of a shock.  The store was just down the street, and I walked down there to buy us  some supplies and went to check out. They checked it all out and wanted  to be paid, and I said,    Well, don   t you have a sack or something to put  this in?    They said,    No, you have to bring your own.    (Laughs) Being a  spoiled American, I wasn   t used to that. (Laughter) They gave me a box  to put the stuff in, and we learned to take our own sacks to the grocery  store.  They had a meat market there and several different stores, and she learned  to do business as an Aussie and buy meat at the meat market. She learned  how to order cuts of meat and whatnot. The first time she went in and  asked for a ham, he brought out a whole leg. It still had the hair on it.  (Laughs)  Higgins What did you guys do for fun with no TV and   ?  Yant Well, we played a lot, Linda and I played a lot of cards. (Laughs) We  went for walks and visited with the neighbors. They eventually put in a,  20  it was a, the Aussies put in a drive-in movie, and we went to the drive-in  movie once a week. She made all of our bread. We got a little char-coaler,  and we charcoaled hamburgers and whatnot, packaged them up and took  them to the drive-in with us.  Higgins Sounds like a home away from home.  Yant Yeah, it was pretty nice really. There, like anywhere in the Navy, one day  run to the next. You get into your routine. One day run to the next, and  time passes.  Higgins How long were you there?  Yant We were there for two years. I got there in June of 1967, and we left in  September of 1969.  Higgins At what point did you have your daughter?  Yant She came much later after I got back to the states. We had been married  nine years when Anne came along. Yeah, we   d gotten back to the states,  and I was out of the service. The service was history then.  Higgins After your two years there, was your enlistment up?  Yant Yeah. Actually, I think that the fact that I got orders to Australia to begin  with was probably an error because I had applied to winter over at a  remote duty station at Antarctic and didn   t get accepted for that. I think  my name got floated for remote duty, and somehow I got orders to remote  duty station in Australia, which turned out to be good for me and for both  of us. After we   d been there eighteen months, all of a sudden, I got orders  back to Vietnam, back to the battalion, and that was just out of the blue.  That just hit me like a ton of rocks. I went to personnel and checked it  out, pointed out the fact that I was there on twenty-four month  accompanied tour. Also, by that time, my brother was in Vietnam. I  pointed that out to them. At that time, if the family wished they could  only have one, the military would only have one sibling in a warzone at  a time.  Higgins What branch was your brother in?  Yant He was in the Navy. He was at Cam Ranh Bay. He was a naval airman.  He was an enlisted man also, but he was in Cam Ranh Bay. Anyway, with  all that, I got to continue my tour and complete my twenty-four-month  tour in Australia. At the end of my tour there, I went back to Port  Hueneme. Linda, we flew together to Los Angeles, and she came on  home. I went on up to Port Hueneme and got discharged. Well, actually,  21  went to inactive reserve. At that time, you had a six-year tour, four years  of active and two years inactive. I went up there and got my discharge  and flew back to Ponca City.  Higgins Did you ever discuss politics with the other enlisted men at any time?  Yant Some. It   s all pretty vague right now, but we had a lot of time together  out there. Where we were at, lots of times it was just me out there. During  the daytime, there were usually two of us, two of us Seabees in the power  plant working. We had time to visit and whatnot. We visited some. We  had magazines, and we got news. Most of the news we got down there  was a week or two old. Magazines and whatnot were a couple of weeks  old by the time we got them in the mail. The mail was slow.  We talked a little bit of politics, and at that time, I was Republican. My  father was a Democrat. I don   t know if I became a Republican because  he was a Democrat. Republicans, supposedly, we   re conservative people,  and I felt like I was conservative and felt like that pretty well described  me. I came to change my mind later on. Well, he wasn   t too happy that I  was a Republican, but that   s the way I voted.  Higgins You were a Nixon supporter at the time.  Yant Well, at that time, yeah, I supported Republicans. Later I came to see the  good that Johnson did when we got the healthcare, the Medicare. Pushed  through the Medicare, and that was, about right now, I   m pretty glad to  have it. (Laughs)  Higgins The Great Society.  Yant Yeah. He did a lot to desegregation. He did a lot with desegregation, and  I admire him for that. I don   t admire him for keeping the war in Vietnam  going. Looking back at the time I was there, I felt like that I needed to be  there because that   s where I was supposed to be at that time, but I didn   t  necessarily agree that   I didn   t really understand it, and I don   t think  very many of us over there did understand why we were there.  Knowing what we know now, looking back, we never should have been  there. It   s the same reason I feel like we never should have been in Iraq  and did what we did in Iraq recently or even Afghanistan, as far as that  goes, trying to change their cultures. There   s no way we were going to  change the culture in Vietnam, South Vietnam. That was kind of my  stance, but I felt like he was doing what he felt like he had to do. He was  my Commander-in-Chief, so I followed orders like everybody else did.  22  Higgins Absolutely. After you got back to the United States, Vietnam was  becoming increasingly unpopular. Did you continue to associate yourself  with Vietnam and the military during that time?  Yant Well, I guess, in my mind, I did. Of course, I was pursuing a career  outside the military then, trying to figure out what I was going to do next.  You have to understand while we were in Australia, the things that  happened over here. Kennedy had already been assassinated, but then his  brother got assassinated. Martin Luther King got assassinated while we  were over there. They were having all the riots and stuff going on over  here. Of course, it was always a week or so late the news came to us, but  boy, the way it sounded, it sounded like America was going to hell in a  handbasket. We thought, certain times, that if it hadn   t been for having  parents here, we might not even come back. Of course, there was no  question we were going to come back home, but we kind of got used to  living in Australia. Of course, we weren   t seeing the main part of  Australia. We were in a remote part, but the way things were going back  here, Australia sounded pretty nice. (Laughter)  Once you got back, I didn   t hear a lot of anti-Vietnam sentiment where  we were. We came back to Ponca City. I don   t know. Maybe I just wasn   t  paying attention to it or what. We came back to Ponca City, and I was  trying to decide what to do next. I thought,    Well, maybe I   ll go back to  Okmulgee and go to school again and finish up that electronics certificate  down there, and at least that would be a start.    We moved to Okmulgee,  and I went to school down there for a month or two and got to talking  to   the classroom just closed in on me. I just wasn   t ready to be closed  in at that time because I   d been two years out in the Outback, and the  classroom just closed in on me. I just couldn   t get my head around it, and  I started looking for other work. I talked to the head of the department,  head of the electronics department there. He and I were friends before,  and I talked to him. He looked into a couple of options for me. There was  a job opening in Tulsa with a company called Southwest Tube. They  needed an industrial electrician.  Then there was a job opening at a place in southeastern Oklahoma. He  said somewhere down south of Sallisaw. It turned out to be Poteau, and  it was a company called Graphics, Incorporated down there. They made  graphic panelboards for control centers for big companies like Johnson  Controls and oil companies and whatnot to control centers. They had  graphic illustrations on the front of it, just illustrating the processes that  were going on and valves and things and switches and things on it. That   s  what they did.  I went to Sand Springs, and I interviewed with Southwest Tube. It  sounded pretty good, but we would have to live in Sand Springs or Tulsa.  23  I just wasn   t ready for a big city. I was ready for country (laughs) after  living in the country for that length of time, and I didn   t want the city  traffic. Where we had been, there   d been no traffic for two years. The  worst traffic I got into was when I hit a kangaroo on the way to work one  night. I just couldn   t wrap my head around living in Tulsa. I interviewed  for the job at Graphics, Incorporated. They were really friendly, and they  seemed to have a good job for me. They offered me a good starting salary.  Seemed like it was around sixty-five hundred dollars a year at that time.  To me, it was a lot of money then. I took the job in Poteau.  Higgins Did your service make you marketable?  Yant At that time, I don   t know if it did or not. It   s not something that, you  couldn   t just tell them that you was a veteran and get points for it, at that  time. I don   t know if it helped or not.  Higgins A far as work experience, it   .  Yant Yeah, the fact that I had the training at Okmulgee, and the electronics  department head recommended me to these two companies, with his  recommendation and a job interview, too, to find out what I knew. It  worked out, and we moved to Poteau. I went to work as a process  technician in the division that built motor control centers for industry.  There was a part of the company that did some routine boxes that they  built for Johnson Controls and remote control centers and panels that  were little extruded panels with controls on them. They were kind of a  cookie cutter, and they were kind of a routine part of the business.  Our part, industrial, we quoted jobs for   the first job I got assigned to,  and actually, the only one I completed was for Mid America Pipeline. It  was a control center. It was thirteen-foot long. It had a three-sixteenth  inch aluminum steel face on it, brushed aluminum, with graphic works,  with knobs and controls on the front of it, and meters. They had electrical  wiring and pneumatic piping in them also. I was assigned that particular  project, going into it. We had the drawings from Mid America Pipeline,  what they wanted, and then I had to take and make drawings, our shop  drawings. The only experience I had at drafting was in junior high in  technical drawing. I relied on that schooling, and I was able to do it and  pull it off.  Sending the parts list to purchasing for ordering, well, the purchasing  department was located in another part of town at that time. In fact, we  were located in another part of town. The manufacture facility was on the  north side of Poteau, and our offices were downtown in an old jailhouse  building. It was a block building that nobody else wanted. Anyway, that   s  where our offices were at that time. We ordered the parts, sent our bills  24  and material into the purchasing office. They would order them, but they  didn   t have time for the follow-up that they needed.  Ken asked me if I would be interested in doing expediting, expediting  parts. I expedited my own parts and expedited parts that were going in on  other projects we had going. There were a bunch of us in that group, and  we had several different projects going at a time. I expedited parts for all  of them. Finished my project, the Mid America project and got it  shipped. About that time, one of the purchasing agents left, and he was  the one who was doing purchasing for our group. He left the company,  so they asked me if I   d be interested in purchasing. I said,    Well, yeah,  I   m expediting anyway. I   m talking to all the vendors. I might as well do  the purchasing, too.    They worked me into the purchasing at that time,  and that   s where I first became involved in purchasing. I purchased all  the materials for our jobs, for all the industrial jobs there. I worked there  from, I went to work for them in the fall of 1969, and I worked until April,  I think it was April or May, I guess it was, of 1978, in their purchasing  department there.  In the meantime, while I was there, it was pretty difficult work and a lot  of pressure. I started looking for something to occupy my time outside of  the office. I   d always wanted to fly, so I decided to take flying lessons. I  did that, learned how to fly, and then one thing led to another. By the time  I got my private license, why, I thought,    Well, heck, maybe I   d want to  fly for a living    and decided to take commercial, go for my commercial  certificate. I commuted to Van Buren, Arkansas, to take commercial pilot  training in my off time, and I did that under the GI Bill. There was a  college there in Poteau that I could have taken classes, but I was more  interested in flying, at that time. I used my GI Bill to get a commercial  rating, and then once I got, that required 160 hours of flight time. The  private required forty hours, so there was two hundred hours of flight  time then.  Then after that, I decided to get my instrument rating and multiengine.  Paid for all that with the GI Bill. I was working on, I was going to get my  instructor   s certificate, and I was kind of getting burned out on Johnson  Control because I couldn   t see a future there for me. I   d been there for  eight and a half years, and I couldn   t see a future there for me. In fact, I  guess I need to back up because Graphics was bought out by Johnson  Controls not long after I got there. The boss that I   d had that hired me, he  got laid off, and there was several people got laid off. There was kind of  a restructuring there.  The owner that had hired me, that owned the Graphics, Mr. Gray, he  retired, so there was kind of a change of personnel there for about the last  six years there at Johnson Controls. I   d worked for Johnson Controls, and  25  I couldn   t see where in Poteau there was any place for me to go. Johnson  Controls    home office was in Milwaukee, and I   d never even considered  going to one of their other locations. That   s where I wanted to be, in  Poteau, but it was kind of a dead end there. The other purchasing agent  had been there longer than I had, so he had seniority. He wasn   t going  anywhere. I was kind of burned out on what I was doing.  I guess what I need to do is back up a little bit. A part of what I was doing  at that time (this was in the    70s), the nuclear power plant business was  booming at that time. What I was doing was buying material for nuclear  power plants, and we were building consoles for nuclear power plants. It  required a whole, it was kind of a whole other mindset to the other stuff  that we were doing for oil companies and chemical companies.  Everything had to be N-stamped and had certificates of compliance and  all that. It was whole other ballgame than what it had been. I got pretty  good at it, you know, but I just felt like I needed to start thinking a little  further down the line of where I was going to be in ten years. I   d had all  this flight training, maybe I could use that and build on that. By that time,  my daughter had come. I started flying in    74. She came in    76. This was     78. I went ahead and gave them my resignation, and we moved to  Stillwater. I started school here in the technical education.  I was taking some flight training to be a flight instructor here. Plus, I was  also taking classes to help me toward a degree. When I got my flight  instructor   s certificate, then I started working on an instrument  certificate, instrument instructor. I went to work part-time for Universal  Aviation here in Stillwater, doing some flight instructing for them. Did a  couple charter flights for them, and I liked it. (Laughs) I visited the airport  in Ponca City, and they were needing pilots. I thought,    Well, maybe I  can get started up there as a pilot.    We moved to Ponca City. I finished a  semester here in    78 and moved to Ponca City at the end of that semester.  What I didn   t realize, I didn   t know that much about the business. The  way they hire pilots, at that time, anyway, for 135 operation, charter and  instructor, the pilot gets to come in and take up space. If they have a  student or if they have a flight, they get paid. Otherwise, they don   t get  paid. Well, this was in December of 1978. It was a bad winter, and I had  several students. I had quite a few students come, and I   d take them.  There weren   t very many charter flights, and what flights I did get, a lot  of them, I wound up flying in ice in the aircraft that weren   t certified for  ice. It was pretty risky, and I didn   t have any insurance to speak of. I had  a little bit of life insurance, but not near enough of what I needed and no  liability insurance to cover me. I don   t know if the operator, fix base  operator, did or not. I assume that he did. I felt my family was pretty  vulnerable. We didn   t have any health insurance, anything. I left my  family pretty vulnerable.  26  After a few weeks of that, bad weather and risky flights, I did finish up  my instrument instructor certificate and got certified to be an instrument  instructor and did a little bit of that, too, and started on multiengine  instruction. In fact, I flew one of the airplanes down (it was an old Piper  Apache) to Oklahoma City for my check ride for multiengine instructor  and certificate. Got down there and got the FAA  Federal Aviation  Administration  certification pilot in there and started it up and didn   t  have oil pressure on one engine. That blew that. I got out of the airplane,  and I called  the company  and told them what I had, that it was down. I  told them,    Well, I need to get home. I want to go home.    By that time, I  had taken a job at Welborn Electric in Ponca City, and I was working  eight hours there and then flight instructing in the evening. I needed to  get home for the next day   s work, and I said,    At the end of the day  tomorrow, I   ll come back and get the airplane and bring it back to Ponca.     Well, by the end of the day the next day, they had already sent somebody  after it. There   s some ill will between me and the owner of the place over  that deal.  I couldn   t ferry the plane back that day due to weather.   We   d had another problem, too. I   d flown a flight into Wichita for them  in icing conditions, instrument icing conditions, and landed it at the  airport up there with a big load of ice on that airplane. They wanted me  to fly it back, and I wouldn   t do it because of the icing conditions. I  wound up renting a car there and driving back to Ponca City, so there was  some hard feelings there. A couple of the other guys from the business  went with me, was in the plane with me that time, and one of them flew  it back. I never did find out the details of that. Flying in icing conditions  in airplanes that aren   t ready for it and aren   t certified for icing, and in  that particular airplane, the directional gyro didn   t work properly. That   s  just a recipe for disaster, and I wouldn   t fly it. That and the multiengine  deal, the owner of the company and I just got crosswise. He wouldn   t call  me when my students showed up. He   d give them to somebody else. I   d  go out there, and I wouldn   t have any students because he   d already give  them to somebody else. I put in a day of work at the electrical shop and  selling electrical supplies and then go out to the airport in the evening  and not have any work. That didn   t work too well.  I guess I need to back up. While we were in Poteau, there was a company  coming into Ponca City who had advertised in the paper that they were  coming, Huffy Corporation. They built bicycles. Their home office is in  Dayton, Ohio. That   s where their manufacturing was. They   d advertised  in the paper that they were coming to Ponca City, and I thought,    Well,  that sounds kind of neat. Maybe I can get a job in Ponca City with them.     This is when I was still with Johnson Controls. I sent them a resume, and  nothing came of it. While we were living in Ponca City, they started  coming about. They started building it out by the airport. My wife was  27  working as a temporary for a temp agency downtown, and Huffy needed  somebody to do some typing for them. While she was there, she told  them, she was talking to the personnel manager and wanted to know,     Did they remember getting my resume?       No, they didn   t.    Told me to  just apply again, so I did. While I was working with Welborn Electric up  there, why, Huffy was building out west of town by the airport, and I was  putting in my time down there and then flight instructing in the evenings.  Well, I went ahead and put in my resume and my application with Huffy,  and in January of 1980, was accepted there as a purchasing agent. Brand  new office, brand new facility, and that worked out really well. That was  really great.  My wife didn   t do any more work for them, but she kind of nudged them  and was kind of a go-between for me to get me in the door there. The guy  she had talked to turned out to be personnel manager that I talked to.  Turns out, my office backed onto his, and we became really good friends.  I worked for Huffy for two and a half years there as they were growing  and building bicycles. They weren   t making a profit yet, but they were  increasing efficiency. It was coming. The very month that we started  making, I think they were trying to get a minimum of 1500 bicycles a day  built. About the time that they reached that goal, they decided to shut that  place down in Ponca City, and I got laid off. I was one of the first group.  It was about 600 of us got laid off in one bunch there, and that was a hit  because we rented a house there and didn   t have any other insurance.   We  had their  health  insurance, and it lasted for a little bit.  My wife had gone to work for the church. She had worked for several  places around town, the insurance office, and she had gone to work for  the church. That was a hit. I sent out resumes, hundreds of resumes. One  of the salespeople who owned a company here in town, here in Stillwater,  IN EN Corporation, was a fellow by the name of Bob Overton. He was  the co-owner of IN EN Corporation, and he called on me in Ponca City  to sell me electrical supplies. Of course, they didn   t have much that I  could buy from him. They had some. We became pretty good  acquaintances.  Bob was one of my, I guess, network people that I turned to. I sent him  an application, and he had, their manufacturing facility here, they were  manufacturing equipment for the oil pipeline business. They had an  electrical supply business that was in support of that, but they were also  selling electrical supplies around northern Oklahoma. He hired me to be  an outside salesman. They didn   t have an outside salesman. Well, at that  time, at the time that Huffy was starting to close down up that was the  time the bank  Penn Square  in Oklahoma City collapsed and the oil  business was collapsing. We were going into a recession. I   d had the  office full of salesmen waiting to see me, sitting out there with gold  28  chains around their necks trying to sell stuff, and all of a sudden, they  were gone. There I was. I went to work as an outside salesman, trying to  sell at a time when nobody was buying. People were trying to reduce their  inventories and just using what they had on hand, and I was out there  trying to sell electrical supplies. I went all over northern Oklahoma, from  Okeene to Pryor to Shawnee, trying to sell electrical supplies, and I was  the only salesman out there. That lasted for nine months, and then that  job went away.  Higgins Tell me about how you got the job at OSU.  Yant Well, that came somewhat later. I went on, got unemployment  compensation after I left him, for six months and eventually got on with  the State Central Purchasing Office. The Office of Public Affairs, it was  called at that time, Central Purchasing in Oklahoma City. I commuted  from Stillwater for two and a half years down there, and I was a buyer  for vendor purchasing. One of the things I had to do there was to go to  minority vender fairs and such as that, and at those places, I came across  Ed Shreve, who was the owner of a new company coming into town here  called Frontier Engineering. He was a friend with Bob Overton.  Bob Overton, when his company went down, he became one of the vice  presidents in Frontier Engineering. I kind of kept in touch with Ed. You  know,    Do you need anybody in purchasing?       No, not yet, not that big  yet.    Kind of kept in touch with him for when he might need a purchasing  agent. Eventually, after two and a half years, they did, and Frontier  Engineering hired me. We were still living in Stillwater. I had been  commuting to the city, so that was kind of nice. I went to work for them  as a purchasing agent and then kind of worked into purchasing  management, the purchasing manager job for the company. Frontier  Engineering turned out to be a large outfit. Eventually, they had offices  in Washington, D.C., and Fallon, Nevada, and Whidbey Island,  Washington, and in Oklahoma City they were a contractor for the FAA.  I was buying supplies for projects they had going, for them, for the  defense department. Whidbey Island and Fallon, Nevada, those were for  top gun school and for   Whidbey Island   s a naval air station. They had  government contracts. I learned working for them. I took seminars, and I  learned how to buy through government contracts and government  purchasing. I had the bid experience from the state, and now I   d gained  experience working with the federal government, working for the federal  government as a contractor, buying with flow-down clauses and whatnot  that need to go in the contracts and whatnot. I got experience with them  doing that. Plus, purchasing evolved. When I managed a purchasing  department there I had several people working for me. Plus, I was  promulgating the purchasing policies for the other offices in the other  29  parts of the country, too, and buying, doing some of their buying. That  was a real challenge. Plus, I got a lot of education. They paid for my  seminars, and I went to Florida and to Arizona, first one place, then  another.  The seminars were learning about doing business for the government,  government buying. I got a pretty good education in that there, and that  lasted until 1991. They were having some problems meeting some of the  government requirements, as far as timesheets and whatnot, and the  government was withholding some funds from them. The business was  owned by a man and his wife who were getting a divorce, and they  decided, at that time, to dissolve the organization as it was and  reorganize. I got laid off. The day I got laid off, they laid off fifty others,  and the place started the reorganization. I got my notice on my birthday,  September 7, 1991, I guess it was. I went on unemployment again, and I  used it up. I was unemployed for six months.  During that time, I had not become certified (I never had gotten a college  degree), but I   d done all the work and got all the points I needed to get  certified as a purchasing manager under the National Association of  Purchasing Management. I   d done all the work, but I just hadn   t taken  the time to go take the test and get certified. There were three tests to  take. I took all the tests and got certified while I was off. I had that going  for me as a CPM. That opened the door for me at the university.  I knew pretty much about what was going on at the university in  purchasing, because my wife had gone to work with the university in  1983 for the animal science department. She did a lot of the buying for  them. Worked for the purchasing department doing requisitions and  whatnot. She interacted with the purchasing department here, and when  she needed something, there were times that I could give her information  that I had when I was working with the state that would help her out, that  would help her, open doors for her in the purchasing department here at  the university. I did have some experience that they could use. Turns out  that the system that they were using in this purchasing department here  was basically the same thing that we were doing in Oklahoma City when  I worked for the state.  My experience there opened doors for me, and I think, by that time, the  fact that I was a veteran also helped open that door. I had good references,  too. Everywhere I went, I got letters of reference, and they were all good.  I had good letters of reference. They did hire me. In the meantime, while  I was waiting to hear from them, I didn   t know if I was going to get on  anywhere or not. I had to do something, so I studied for a real estate  license. I got licensed as a realtor, and I sold one piece of property. The  day that that property was supposed to close was the day that Fred  30  Williamson called me from purchasing and wanted to interview me. I had  to ask him to delay my interview while I closed on the house. (Laughs)  After the closing, I went up and interviewed with Fred, and he did hire  me. I went to work here on April Fool   s Day, 1992, and worked as a  buyer here until I retired in 2010, October 2010.  Higgins What were some of your favorite memories of OSU?  Yant Oh, I don   t know. We did the seminars, purchasing seminars. The  different departments on campus would come a couple times a year to  our seminars, and doing those was always nice. I had commodities like  the other buyers had. I bought the scientific equipment, instruments and  equipment, electrical supplies, heating and air-conditioning, a lot of the  stuff I had experience in. The scientific equipment, I didn   t, but the  professors that had the requirements, a lot of the times, if they knew that  I didn   t know anything about it, they   d give me a hard time. When they  found out that I was really there trying to help them, once they told me  what they needed and why they needed it or how they needed it, that I  could work the system for them and get it for them and cut red tape and  could help them, I became friends with a lot of the department heads and  scientists here on campus, as well as other departments, too.  Not just the science department but the other departments, I was able to  help them, too. Being able to help them do their job was good for me.  That was what I was here for, and it paid off. I became friends with a lot  of people, and you know, I got experience buying from overseas. They  put in a cleanroom here, and we bought a lot of equipment from overseas.  I got that experience. I was able to help along the way, open doors for  these professors that needed opening and work with the customs. I  learned how to get stuff into the country and what it took to get things in  free. I found, discovered different ways to get things in duty-free and how  to do that and work with professors to get their stuff in here in a timely  manner and free. That meant a lot to them, and it meant a lot to me, too,  because it opened doors for me. It worked real well. I enjoyed it, but  there   s a lot of politics in buying for the university because it   s a public  institution. The politics is a downside and trying to work around that.  Higgins Well, you grew up in Oklahoma, and though you went to Vietnam and  Australia, you came back to Oklahoma. My question is what does  Oklahoma mean to you?  Yant Well, it   s home. It really is. I couldn   t really think about moving  anywhere else. I never could really. We thought about living in Australia  there for a while, but after we got home, we were glad to be home. We  were here to take care of our parents in their old age and help them with  their infirmities and bury them. They   re buried here, and this is where  31  our roots are. I was born in Ponca City and Linda, my wife, was born in  Durant. She was raised in Ponca City. We became friends at the age of,  she was fourteen, and I was fifteen. We   ve known each other all this time,  and this is home.  Higgins Before I ask my closing question, is there anything throughout this  interview that you wanted to talk about that I haven   t asked or hasn   t  come up yet?  Yant No, we   ve pretty well covered it, I think. I   m not sure what it would be.  Higgins Well, I have one more question other than this one. Were you exposed to  Agent Orange during your time in Vietnam?  Yant The area that I was in was. Personally, I was not, but having served in  that area that was, the whole I Corp area basically is now certified as  Agent Orange. We were west of Da Nang. That whole area, at one time  or another, was sprayed with Agent Orange. Agent Orange was used   .  Higgins Have you had any negative health consequences?  Yant I have not had any myself, no. I did go down and take the Agent Orange  physical. I don   t know if something could come up later on it, but at this  point, I don   t have any. My main concern, I smoked for a number of  years, and that   s on me. When I was working for IN EN, I got some  asbestos exposure, and I   m sure I got asbestos exposure in the Navy, too.  That   s probably my chief concern is whether my lungs will hold out, you  know, if I have any side effects from that. So far, I haven   t, and I thank  God for that. As far as Agent Orange goes, I really don   t see, I don   t think  that I   ve had enough exposure to Agent Orange to have any disability  because of it.  Higgins I only have one, final question, and that is how would you want to be  remembered?  Yant As somebody that loved his family and worked for them and showed up  every day and did his job. I had a work ethic that I got from my father,  and I know I instilled that in my daughter because she   s got a good work  ethic, too. She   s an advisor, admissions advisor in the graduate school at  the University of Texas at Dallas. She   s got a tremendous work ethic, and  I   m really proud of her for that. If we could just impart that to our  grandkids, why, I guess that would be it.  Higgins Well, Mr. Yant, I   d like to thank you for your service to your country, and  I   d like to thank you for sharing your story with us.  32  Yant You   re sure welcome. Thank you.  -------  -------
