Anderson: My name is Benjamin Anderson. Today is May 10, 2018. I’m joined by
Professor Nan Keohane to conduct our first interview for the Stanford
Faculty Oral History Project and the Pioneering Women Oral History
Project, which are carried out by the Stanford Historical Society.
Professor Keohane, I was wondering if you could just tell me a little
bit about your family and childhood and the place you grew up.
Keohane: My background is complicated because my father was a Presbyterian
minister who liked to shift gears every four or five years, so we moved a
good deal when I was growing up, which gave me opportunities to see
different parts of the South. It was always in the South because he was a
southern Presbyterian minister. But within that context, we lived in three
places in Arkansas and in South Carolina and in Texas.
[0:00:51] I was born in Blytheville, Arkansas, a little town close to the
shores of the Mississippi, just northwest of Memphis. I don’t have many
memories of that because we left it when I was three and went to

15

Texarkana, right on the border between Arkansas and Texas. I have a few
memories of that, but not many. Most of my early memories date from my
time in Greenwood, South Carolina, where we moved when I entered
elementary school and then spent a year in Dallas, Texas, when my father
was doing a post-doc in Europe. My mother was working in Dallas and
living with her mother. Then I went to junior high and high school in Hot
Springs, Arkansas.
I have a brother and a sister, and my mother and father were both
really interesting and involved people. Our childhood involved [a good deal
of] travel. I’d never been northeast of Washington, DC, when I applied to
college, but we had been to California, to Cuba, to Mexico, Chicago, and all
over the South. That’s enough for now. Those are the sorts of things that I
first think of.
Anderson: [00:02:01] Did your mother do anything for work or was she just raising you
all full-time?
Keohane: You have to remember this was the 1940s and 1950s, and very few women
worked professionally, particularly if they were married with children. She
was, however, very talented. She had been a journalist, a professional
journalist when she married, and she gave that up, but she was very
interested in writing. She wound up not only being a minister’s wife--which is
in the South a pretty significant sort of like First Lady commitment to be part
of the church--but also writing books, little textbooks in Christian higher
education for Sunday school. So yes, she had a professional life, but her main
role to other people was as a minister’s wife and a mother of three kids.

16

[00:02:54] As soon as we all went to college, Mother went back for
her MA at Chapel Hill, became a professor and then a dean. So she clearly
had such abilities, but it was not the sort of thing women of her generation
[usually did if they were raising a family].
Anderson: Do you remember any values that your parents taught you--religious or
nonreligious?
Keohane: I was certainly raised in the Christian faith and I went through, you know,
baptism and what you would call confirmation in other parts of Christianity.
Christianity was important to me growing up, as a key part of my life. I did
things like play the piano for Wednesday evening church service and I
attended church, of course, every Sunday. And at lunch, my father would
ask me to list the main points of his sermon, so that I would be sure to
listen. And there were always three. So I figured when we got to three, I
could stop. [laughs]
[00:03:55] But in terms of significant values, there was a very strong
value of the importance of education, of ideas, of books, of art, of culture.
Also of travel, as I mentioned. And support for the rights of others. At that
point in the South, there was a lot of discrimination, of course. It was the
Jim Crow era, and my father and mother were both quite liberal compared
to most of their friends and family members, although compared to a liberal
person in New York, they might not have seemed that much so. But my
father did things like invite members of the black Presbyterian church in
Hot Springs to come to service at our church occasionally and would
prepare very carefully for that so that our guests wouldn’t be sitting by

17

somebody who might sort of look like, “What’s this?”
[00:04:52] So there were clearly values of inclusiveness and tolerance
and rights and openness. It was not a political family. My mother was mainly
interested in art and ideas and culture, and my father was mainly interested
in philosophy and music. So we didn’t spend much time talking about
politics compared, for example, with my husband’s family, where politics
seems to have been their daily bread. So that was something I didn’t get in
my life, but we had a lot of opportunities. I enjoyed being with my siblings
and I had good friends, so I would call it a happy childhood. Childhoods
always have ups and downs, but I think mine was happy.
Anderson: Do you recall anything about what kind of gender roles existed in your
family, for example, in what chores were given to you versus your siblings?
Keohane: I don’t remember the chores themselves being particularly gender-bound. It
had more to do with expectations. My father clearly knew that I was smart
and intellectually really interested, and so he wanted to teach me some
philosophy, but I don’t think it ever occurred to him that I would have a
career.
[00:06:07] Whereas my father put all his hopes for having a really
visible career and succeeding [professionally into my brother], and that was
hard for my brother. Although he’s done well with professionally, I think it
made his childhood much more complicated because he was pushing back
against that set of expectations. So it was more gender expectations for the
future than at the present.

18

Anderson: And what goals did you have for your future when you were a child growing
up?
Keohane: Very few. [laughs] I mean, it wasn’t the sort of thing girls did in the 1950s. I
never had any sense that I would have a particular profession or ambitions.
I just did it sort of year-by-year. I knew I loved to read, I liked books, and I
knew I would go to college. And then after that, I would probably get
married and have kids and what else I didn’t know. That was the way we
thought in the 1950s.
Anderson: Did you have any other interests outside of school that you haven’t
mentioned?
Keohane: [00:06:58] Oh yes. My father and I used to go for long hikes in Hot Springs
because it’s a national park. There are great mountains. I also went out for
hikes with my best friend then, and we talked all afternoon. So I loved hiking.
Cycling, I remember once when we were in Florida, my father did a guest
ministry in Ocala, Florida, one summer, and I had a bike. I loved cycling, and
I took off before breakfast to cycle for quite a long way. And of course, it was
before cell phones, and I didn’t leave a note, and my family had no idea what
had happened to me, but I had just gotten started and it was so interesting I
just wanted to go further and further. And that, my husband will tell you, is a
feature of my personality. Just to the next corner, just to the next bend in the
road. I want to see what’s there.
[00:07:45] So hiking, cycling, exploring, traveling I’ve mentioned. I
loved drama. I had the lead in the school play each year in high school, and
that was a wonderful experience. I was also a member of the chorus--I sang

19

alto--and we were invited to go to Chicago my junior year to sing at the
International Rotary Convention. We went up on a train, traveled all night. I’d
never been to a place like Chicago, and it was an eye-opening experience. So
yes, I had a lot of interests. I wasn’t an officer in student government, and I
wasn’t a member of the “fast set.” I had a group of very close friends, but we
did things like reading and hiking and talking, and not going to big parties.
Anderson: Can you tell me a little bit more about where you went to school and what
that was like?
Keohane: [00:08:45] The most vivid memories are Hot Springs. In junior high school,
I had a really good drama teacher whom I loved, and that’s one reason it
became a major interest. It was also a big interest for my mother. I also had
a great biology teacher early in high school, and I became fascinated by
biology. And I remember I was given a manicure set for Christmas that year
by people who thought I wasn’t taking care of my nails. I took it to school
to use it to dissect a tarantula. It worked. [laughter]
That wasn’t exactly what they had in mind, but it worked. So I really
liked biology and I liked geometry as well, but the teaching was very uneven.
I had a great teacher of English literature and a wonderful teacher of
history, all of this in high school, which I’ll come back to. But [our nice but
weak] Spanish teacher had no control over the class; he also taught algebra,
and people would throw erasers at him. It was awful. That was junior high
school.
[00:09:55] But in high school, I had mostly very fine teachers; my
American history teacher, who was a fantastic teacher but also sometimes an

20

alcoholic, had been a used car salesman. He was an unusual teacher. But he
was a very gifted one, and both [President] Bill Clinton and I --we went to
the same high school [a few years apart]--wrote eulogies for the local
newspaper when Mr. Mears died. He had shaped our lives so profoundly.
For me, when I was a junior in high school, I had just assumed I would go
to a southern Presbyterian women’s college because [other members of my
family had attended small Presbyterian colleges], although my mother had
gone to the University of Texas.
[00:10:42] However, Mr. Mears, the history teacher, learned that a
representative was coming to our school from the Seven College
Conference, meaning the Seven Sisters like Radcliffe, Bryn Mawr, Wellesley.
Her job was to talk to girls from west of the Mississippi, which we were just
barely, and persuade us to go northeast to school and to apply for a
scholarship. So I thought, that sounds interesting. I knew nothing about any
of these colleges, but I decided I didn’t have a lot to lose, so I applied for
the scholarship, a Seven College scholarship, and I won one. I had to give a
sense of which college I would go to if I won it. They were all strange to
me, but I chose Wellesley because I had a cousin who had attended there.
Therefore, I knew real people could go there, and I also thought the campus
looked beautiful. I liked the idea of being close to Boston. So I chose
Wellesley and Wellesley chose me, and Mr. Mears having inspired me to do
that made all the difference in my life.
[00:11:44] One more story about Mr. Mears and then I’ll stop with
this. He gave us an examination at the end of the first semester of junior

21

year in American history, and the main question was who should have won
the American Revolution. I gave all the reasons why, of course, the colonies
should have won. I got an A-minus. At that point in my life, I didn’t get Aminuses, so I went in, I said, “So what was wrong?” He said, “It was a fine
paper as far as it went, but you should have taken”--he didn’t use the word
counterfactual, but that’s what he meant--“you should have taken the
contrarian view. It’s much harder to develop.” I thought “Wow!” That really
shaped me intellectually. I’ll never forget it.
Anderson: I want to circle back to your time at Wellesley, and the process of getting
there. What would you say you expected to get from attending college?
Keohane: I expected it to be wonderful, to be able to read and write and learn from
great teachers and spend a lot of time in the library and have good friends.
But like most people in my era, I had a pretty vague sense of what it meant.
I’d never visited a campus with the intention of going there the way people
do now. I’d been to college campuses, but it was to, you know, attend a
performance or something. I had very little sense of what it would be like.
But I knew that this was something I generally wanted to do and looked
forward to it.
Anderson: [00:13:12] And what did you study at Wellesley?
Keohane: I came without strongly-conceived views, but I sort of thought I would do
philosophy because that’s what my father taught me. Or history. But
somehow history fell by the wayside early, which is too bad. I wish I’d taken
more. I did take philosophy, and I took political science because I found it
interesting and had a social science requirement. I took biology for my

22

science, and I remember that you had to have a project in biology. At that
time it was still divided into zoology and botany; the zoology was in the fall
and the botany was in the spring, but you would have one yearlong project.
[00:13:47] I chose to do mine on the evergreens in the Hunnewell
Pinetum across the lake from Wellesley so that I could go and lie under the
trees and look up at them and spend my time outside instead of in the lab,
with or without a manicure kit. That was a very important experience as
well. I loved that, and it put so many things together. My introductory
course in political science was okay, but the second year, I took political
philosophy and I had, again, a wonderful teacher named Dante Germino,
who had a real gift for making the subject come alive, from Plato to Marx.
I loved it, and I thought, “This is what I want to do with my life.
People are studying justice and liberty and what it means to have power and
isn’t this the most important thing you could possibly do?” So I decided I
would be a political philosopher. I majored in political science, minored in
philosophy with a specialization in political philosophy.
Anderson: And what was Wellesley like during the time you were on campus?
Keohane: Well you know, of course, it was an all-women’s college.
Anderson: Yes.
Keohane: [00:15:00] Many of the best colleges open to women [at that time were
single-sex], except for Stanford, Cornell, Chicago, Duke and a few others;
but in many ways, the best were the Seven Sisters. It’s interesting I didn’t
consider Duke, [with a Woman’s College]. But anyway, Wellesley was a
wonderful community of young women students with very strong,

23

dedicated male and female faculty. A more significant proportion of female
faculty than most other colleges, and an almost entirely female
administration. Wellesley had never had a male president, unlike all the
other Seven Sisters, which have had several male presidents.
That was formative, because when I would go into the library to
study, which I did often, the main reading room had around the wall
pictures of all the presidents, as reading rooms often do in libraries in
colleges. And at Wellesley they were all women, [strong women from several
different eras]. And that was an incredible mental image, which I didn’t
think a lot about, but I’m sure it had a huge impact.
[00:16:03] The other thing that I did in the library my freshman year:
having come from Arkansas and having had a good public high school
education but now with young women who had gone to the best possible
private schools in the East; they knew so much more than I did, or at least
they pretended to know more than I did. I felt like “I’m so badly prepared,
I’ll never make it here.” So I got myself a carrel in the library with a view of
the lake on the one hand, and a big unabridged dictionary on the other, and
I spent my freshman year going over to the unabridged dictionary to look
up every word I didn’t know.
I did okay. I did pretty well my first semester, quite well my second
semester, and very well sophomore year, but I had a lot of coming up to
speed to do in my own mind. I’m not sure I really had that much in my
professors’ minds, but that was the way it felt. But I also made good friends.
My only regret is I probably did work too hard compared with having more

24

dimensions to my life.
[00:17:07] Because I loved drama so much, I went and tried out for a
lead in the Wellesley major production in the fall [as soon as I got there],
and didn’t get it, and took that to mean that I wasn’t good enough for
college. In fact, it was a play with four characters. Only two of them were
women, and the notion that this raw freshman would get one of them, and
the fact that I didn’t indicated that I wasn’t any good, was just a huge leap.
I’m sorry that I didn’t spend more time trying to go into drama and going
into the Shakespeare society or whatever. But apart from that, I mostly
enjoyed my time at Wellesley, and I surely learned a lot.
Anderson: So during the little time that you weren’t studying, how did you spend your
extracurricular time?
Keohane: Walking around the lake. Talking to my roommate on long walks. I was
head of Chapel because some of the religious background still carried over.
I had been involved in Chapel as an advisor in the dormitories and then I
was head of the Chapel organization, which meant I spent time at morning
chapel sometimes, so that was still important. [I also sang in the choir]. We
went into Boston sometimes to go to museums or to concerts. And I spent
time sitting in the corridor in my dormitory having long bull sessions late
into the night. So it wasn’t all work, but fewer extracurricular activities than
in retrospect I wish I’d engaged in.
Anderson: Did you and your friends find opportunities to meet people and go on dates
and that sort of thing when you were in college?

25

Keohane: Yes, although it was all rather artificial. We did, and that was an important
part of my life. I shouldn’t make it sound as though I was a recluse.
[00:18:53] I went on several dates my freshman year with people at
Harvard. We had common friends, and they asked me out because they
learned from their friends I was there, and some of them included several
dates, but none of them got particularly serious. My sophomore year, the
Wellesley choir went to Wesleyan to perform with the Wesleyan choir
because Wesleyan was all men, and we did Braham’s German Requiem. That
was a memorable weekend. It was a wonderful opportunity performing that
great work together.
But we also spent time with the guys. You know, we went to
fraternity parties and whatever. That was a lot of fun, and I became involved
that weekend in a very general way with a young man at Wesleyan [named
Bob Hammond], so we dated occasionally. I would go down to Wesleyan,
or he would come up to Wellesley, but not often. I continued to have some
dates at Harvard; but junior year, Bob and I became very close and really
were pretty serious about each other.
[00:19:59] [Right after Thanksgiving my senior year, my Wesleyan
boyfriend broke up with me in order to date my roommate. I was fairly
devastated by this], and concentrated more and more on my work. But [by
February, Bob] decided he’d made a mistake; he invited me to senior prom
at Wesleyan and we had a fantastic time. I got pinned. People would wear
their guy’s fraternity pin. So I got pinned for the last few months of senior
year, and that was quite glorious. He went off to do service work in Africa,

26

and I went to England as a Marshall scholar, so we split up. We kept
writing, but we ceased being a couple. [We are still friends, with holiday
cards and an occasional email].
Anderson: I was wondering if there was anything like a women’s movement at
Wellesley at the time. I know it was a little bit early.
Keohane: It was too early. But we were a women’s college and a very avowedly
feminist one--our founder Henry Fowle Durant had said “women can do
the work, I give them the chance.” And as I said, there’d never been a male
president. I mean, it was a woman-centric community despite very strong
male professors being involved.
[00:21:10] And so, no, it wasn’t a movement, but the whole college
was sort of the result of a first-wave feminist movement.
Anderson: And who would you say, if there’s someone you haven’t already mentioned,
was the most important person you worked with or met during your time at
Wellesley?
Keohane: Dante Germino, whom I did mention. A couple of other professors who
were in other courses that I enjoyed, intellectual history, including reading
all kinds of wonderful people. But Germino was the one who stands out.
Otherwise, it was mostly friends and family members who were important
to me; professors mattered, but I didn’t become really close to any of them
except Germino.
Anderson: Do you have any friends that you want to talk about in particular?
Keohane: [00:21:57] [Mostly it was the other women on my “corridor” in the dorm].
We all went on and did different things. Some of us have remained pretty

27

close in the sense that we correspond and see each other occasionally. But
we are not as close as some groups of friends from Wellesley who regularly
get together for reunions and things. My college friends were close, although
never as close as my friend from high school that I went hiking with, Louise
Row. She and I are still very close and get together as often as we can, so
that friendship is the deepest. But there were some good ones at Wellesley,
yes.
Anderson: Would you say that going to Wellesley changed your aspirations or your
expectations for yourself in terms of your career and future?
Keohane: It probably did unconsciously, but I didn’t come out of there with the
ambition to become a professor. I didn’t know what I was going to do, but I
did know that I wanted to travel and that I’d always been fascinated by
Great Britain.
[00:22:57] When I applied for and won a Marshall scholarship, the
first that a Wellesley woman had ever received, I turned down Harvard,
where I’d also been accepted for graduate school in political theory. I must
have had some vague sense that if I was going to get a PhD, I would
probably go on and teach, but it was more that rather than “my ambition in
life is to be a professor and here’s how I get there.” I wanted to continue to
study. I loved working on political theory. The next step was a PhD. I
applied to Harvard and I would have done it there, but when I got the
Marshall scholarship, I couldn’t turn that down, and it was a very formative
experience to be at Oxford. It was there that I developed the strong

28

ambition to be a professor. It didn’t really come at Wellesley. I just was
going to take the next step.
Anderson: I’m going to talk about Oxford in a second, but before we move on to that,
I just wanted to know if there was anything going on in the outside world
during your time at Wellesley that you felt strongly influenced your
experience when you were there.
Keohane: [00:23:57] Well, there were a lot of things going on, but one thing that was
particularly memorable for me is my senior year was the beginning of the
civil rights movements and the sit-ins. And of course having come from
Arkansas, I was well aware of segregation. I haven’t talked as much as I
should about how powerful Jim Crow was and how I disliked but got used
to having separate water fountains and having the black people, “the
negroes,” sitting in the balcony at the movies, and that was the way life was.
And I didn’t think it was right, but it’s the way life was.
With that background, I feel still to this day somewhat guilty that I
didn’t get more involved in the civil rights movement because I knew how
bad things were in the South. And the one thing that I really regretted-Wellesley had a group of women who formed an organization to join the
national boycott of Woolworth’s, a shop in downtown Wellesley with a
national franchise.
[00:25:04] People were boycotting Woolworth’s because of their
practices on race. And so a number of my acquaintances, no close friends,
but a number of my acquaintances were going to picket Woolworth’s and
spend time in protest. And I thought about doing it. I didn’t do it because I

29

was too engaged in my work; but I also thought, well, this is not something
people in my family have ever done. Seems a little weird to be walking up
and down the street. I’m not sure what that would feel like. But I was being
a coward, frankly. I was ambivalent about it at the time, and I always
regretted it afterward. There were other opportunities where I did protest
and picket, and I did it later in life partly because I felt so bad about having
been such a timid soul my senior year at Wellesley. So that was the most
important outside influence.1
[00:26:02] Also, my senior year, January was John F. Kennedy’s
inaugural address. We all sat on the floor in front of the television listening
to that speech, and we were all fired up. “Ask not what your country can do
for you. Ask what you can do for your country.” We were all ready to go out
and change the world. Yes. That--my senior year--was a really crucial time.
Anderson: So when you were applying for the Marshall scholarship what did you write
about? Do you remember?
Keohane: I don’t remember exactly what the questions were, but it wasn’t like you
write an essay. You apply. It’s a long application form, and I don’t
remember exactly what I said. I do remember the interview, [which was a
very odd event]. I can tell you about that.
Anderson: Yes, what was that like?
Keohane: [00:26:57] I mean, Wellesley, never having had a Marshall scholar, although
people were really delighted I was applying, nobody knew how to give me
Note from Nannerl Keohane: The summer after my junior year, in 1960, I went to Washington, DC, as part
of a small group of Wellesley women in the Wellesley/Vassar Washington internship. I worked as an intern in
Senator Estes Kefauver’s office, and really caught “Potomac Fever.” Ever since, I have always thought it would
be great to be a senator, but never took any serious steps in that direction.
1

30

advice. For example, I didn’t even know that if you were from the South,
you could go back home for your interview. I could have applied from the
Southeastern region and then be up against the set of people who would be
good, [but from a smaller number of fine schools]. But I applied in the
Northeast because that’s where I was based. Think of the schools I was up
against, everywhere from Yale to Bowdoin. But it never occurred to me not
to do it because it was so much more convenient, and there I was.
So I went in to Boston on a cold December or late-November
afternoon to sit at the British consulate on Beacon Hill to be interviewed for
a Marshall scholarship. You can imagine. I’m not sure if you’ve ever been
part of such a group. We were all sitting around the living room of the
consulate thinking about what the questions probably would be and what
we could say, making small talk but mostly just sort of anticipating.
[00:27:59] I assumed they would ask me about my honors thesis, and
I was all ready to talk about Plato, which is what my honors thesis was
about at Wellesley, Plato’s Republic. So I went in and when my turn came, sat
down at the table. There were six or seven people around the table, and at
the other end was John Sloan Dickey, the president of Dartmouth. He was
chairing the committee, the selection committee for that region.
As soon as I sat down, he turned to me and said, “Well, Ms.
Overholser, why should we give you a Marshall scholarship when you’ll
probably just get married and have kids?” And without even thinking my
southern ingenuity came to my rescue, my southern accent was exaggerated,
and I said, “Well, President Dickey, that question hits a woman right

31

between the eyes.” Everybody roared. Somebody asked me a question about
Plato, and we were on the way.
[00:29:01] There was no good answer to that question. I mean,
somebody who asks a question like that now would be sued, but at the time,
that was what people did. I couldn’t say, “Well, I have a deep ambition to be
a professor,” because it wasn’t true. I couldn’t say, “Well, I really want to
travel. I really think the UK sounds like a great place to be,” because it
sounded lame. And I couldn’t say, “Well, I don’t know. I think I may get
married and have kids, but that’s not my current ambition.” Any reasonable
answer would have just sounded, you know, limp. So whatever goddess
inspired me to say that was really, really helpful.
Anderson: [laughs] So when you went to Oxford, you went to St. Anne’s College,
right?
Keohane: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Anderson: And that was an all-women’s college, wasn’t it?
Keohane: At that time, only women’s colleges [at Oxford or Cambridge] admitted
women. It was only later that the other colleges [in these universities] went
“mixed,” as they put it.
Anderson: [00:29:56] And what was the relationship between the people at St. Anne’s
College and the rest of the university?
Keohane: There were five fine women’s colleges. We were very much part of the
university. We weren’t as rich as Christ Church or St. John’s, but we had our
rowing crew, we had our celebration dinners, we had our tutors, but we also
went and took tutorials at other places, [as everyone in the university did].

32

So we were very integrated. It wasn’t as though the women’s colleges were
on the edge in some way. We weren’t as rich, we weren’t as old, but we were
certainly part of Oxford in a very mainstream way, and most of my tutorials,
in fact, after my first year, were not at St. Anne’s, but were at other colleges.
I studied with John Plamenatz at Pembroke College, who was a really great
political theorist. I listened to lectures from Sir Isaiah Berlin, who was one
of the best of the best. So I had a fantastic opportunity to study political
philosophy, and I learned a great deal. The college was where you were
based, but the whole university was your bailiwick.
Anderson: [00:31:00] Mm-hmm. And what did you focus on?
Keohane: Well, you “read” [for your undergraduate degree]. I was taking a second BA
that becomes an MA. I read philosophy, politics, and economics, PPE, which
a lot of Americans do, called “Modern Greats” [to distinguish it from “the
Greats,” Classics]. At that time, unlike now, you had to take all three. Now
you can choose two of the disciplines, but we had to take all three. I loved
the philosophy and the politics, but economics was something I sort of had
to grind through. I had done not particularly well in economics at Wellesley.
Still, I was glad I had [to take economics at Oxford], I learned a lot.
Oxford gives degrees of various sorts--first, second class, third class,
honors, or pass. There was apparently a question as to whether I would get
first or second class on the basis of my written exams.
[00:32:02] I don’t know how much you know about Oxford, but at
the end of every term, you don’t take exams or anything. You just have
done your work for that term, [writing short papers for tutorials each week,

33

then] you go on to the next subject, and everything rests on the exam at the
end of two years. When I got to that exam, they couldn’t decide after
reading my papers whether to give me a First or a Second. So unlike most
people, I had to come back for an oral exam not once but twice in the
course of the day, for more examining.
Anderson: Oh my gosh.
Keohane: My hypothesis--I mean, this is just what I think may have happened--is that
the philosophers were really keen on my work, the political scientists were
fine with it, but the economists were saying [grimaces]. In the end, I got the
First. But the viva voce was a very grueling experience.
Anderson: Can you tell me about the new friends that you made at Oxford and what
you did during your free time?
Keohane: [00:33:01] Sure. I was part of what was called the graduate common room,
even though I was reading for an undergraduate degree because that’s where
all the people who already had an undergraduate degree were affiliated.
There was a junior common room, a middle common room, and a senior
common room; I was part of the middle common room, and I became a
pretty active member there. There were women from all over the world
there who were coming to study in England.
I made friends--not deep friendships, but serious friendships that
were important at the time with women from lots of different places. For
instance, a group of us who were not from Britain traveled to Europe the
first Christmas vacation and went to Italy and had a fantastic time together.
We did things like that, and I also, not surprisingly, went for long walks and

34

spent a lot of time enjoying the beauties of Oxford, and pretty often went in
to London to go to a play on the train or whatever.
[00:34:02] I did have friends, yes, although none of them became
lifelong friends except some of the other Marshall scholars.
Anderson: And was it difficult being that far away from your family? Did you get to go
back and see them often?
Keohane: No, [not until after the first year. It was hard at first but became somewhat
easier].
Anderson: Did you write some kind of thesis or dissertation when you were at Oxford?
Keohane: No, it was an undergraduate degree, and everything was that final exam.
Anderson: What about your thesis for Wellesley on Plato’s Republic? Do you have
anything else that you want to share about that? That sounds really
interesting to me.
Keohane: It was, and I enjoyed it very much, and I’m trying to remember exactly what
I wrote on. I still have a copy of it, but it is [in Princeton so I can’t just pull
it off the shelf and check]. It was some aspect of Plato’s Republic that I was
fascinated by.
[00:35:03] And yes, I really enjoyed doing that. I loved the active
research. I found that such a fascinating text. I just wanted to study it from
every angle, and after I later became a professor, I taught the Republic in
almost every class I ever taught, including classes on leadership. It’s a text
that has stayed with me all the time, and it’s partly because I spent so much
time on it at Wellesley.

35

Anderson: What influenced your choice to continue your education and pursue a PhD
at Yale?
Keohane: Well, one of the Marshall scholars I became closest to was named Patrick
Henry. He was from Dallas, Texas. His father was also a minister, and we
became very close. He invited me to the Christ Church commemoration
ball, which was an amazing experience. He rowed, and therefore I went
down to the river to cheer on his crew. [00:35:59] And that first spring, he
asked me to marry him, and--it was a complicated situation. I thought, wow.
I mean, we were romantically involved, not in the way you might be now,
but very close and I thought, well, this is the sort of person I ought to
marry, and this seems like a good thing to do for my life, so I agreed to
marry him.
We married the summer after that first year. It was a very whirlwind
romance. Much too quick, and we were much too young. But we got
married [at my dad’s church in Memphis, TN, then] went back to Oxford
and we lived in a house on the Iffley Road. And I remember my mentor at
St. Anne’s when she learned I was getting married said, “Tsk, tsk, tsk, and
we thought you were a good bet for a First. You’ll never get one now.” Just
because I was getting married.
[00:36:54] It was a good way to live because we were very supportive
of each other, working hard that final year, and also, we traveled together
and enjoyed England together, and that was fine. But the reason it’s relevant
to your question is he had already committed to going to Yale to study
religion, and I don’t know what I thought I was going to do after Oxford.

36

That whole first term [of our final year at Oxford], I mean, it seems
impossible now, but at the time, I sort of just was floating into it. Then on
the final day when the applications for graduate school were due at Yale, the
night before, I woke up in a cold sweat and I thought, “Is this what I want
to do with my life? I’m going to type his dissertation, I’m going to teach at
some community college or something? Is this what I want to do?”
So I telegraphed Yale and said, “Is there any way I can apply for
admission at this last minute as a Marshall scholar with the record we can
share with you?” And bless their hearts, they said yes.
[00:36:06] So I wound up going to Yale, which was the best political
science department in the country at that point, but it wasn’t a place you
would go to study political philosophy. That would have been Harvard or
Princeton. But I learned a lot, and in many ways, I’m glad I went because I
became a much better political philosopher for having known more political
science, comparative politics, and American politics. But that’s how I got
there, and then once I had made that decision, once I had that epiphany,
that time in Oxford that fall, I never looked back. I knew I wanted to be a
professor. Never had any further questions.
Anderson: So you didn’t work on political philosophy while you were at Yale? You
worked on political science?
Keohane: [00:39:50] No, no, I worked on political philosophy, but I had to take some
courses like statistics, and I had to have a second field of comparative
politics. At Harvard, I wouldn’t have had to take statistics and I probably
would have had a much less dramatically important second field. It would

37

have been much more focused on political theory. But I think I got a better
education in some ways. I can’t say it’s better. It was different.
Anderson: What was the gender balance among PhD students? Were you one of the
few women pursuing a PhD at Yale?
Keohane: That puts it mildly. There were no women faculty. There were no women
undergraduates. Women had only recently been admitted to the professional
schools and to the graduate school. So there were women graduate students,
but the only other women around were the staff people and the secretaries
and the house cleaners. So we were all odd ducks. Some of the professors
were wonderfully supportive, some of our male colleagues were wonderfully
supportive, and some of them were not. There was one professor whom I
had particularly wanted to study with who didn’t believe women could do
political philosophy, and so he didn’t admit women to his seminars.
[00:42:03] But the year I came in, another young woman who was
also interested in political philosophy with a fine record was there as well.
We mentioned to the department that he said he wouldn’t let us come to the
seminar, and they weren’t even aware of that. They told him he had to let us
in, and he did. He was perfectly civil, but that’s about as misogynist as you
get. To know that the professor who was teaching us didn’t think we were
mentally capable of doing the work was not great, but I learned a good deal
from him.
[In political science more generally], I read all these books, and in
some of them, I dutifully underlined things that were incredibly misogynist,
[yet it never occurred to me to question them]. I look back at them now and

38

I think, “How did I swallow this stuff?” But I learned a lot anyway because
it was a great department and very fine professors. The best in my view
apart from the political philosophers was Robert Dahl, who’s truly a brilliant
political scientist who shaped a discipline. And I took everything he gave. So
it was a helpful experience, but it was very hard being a woman there, yes.
Anderson: [00:41:07] Were there other ways that you felt like your opportunities were
limited because of being a woman at Yale at the time?
Keohane: No, I don’t think so. I was married, remember, and had a baby as I was
writing my dissertation, so my experience would have been different from a
graduate woman living in the graduate women’s dorm or whatever.
Anderson: That makes sense. And who did you work with most closely and what was
your research focusing on at the time?
Keohane: Besides Frederick Watkins, the one I just described, I worked with Joseph
Hamburger and Alexander D’Entrêves but also mostly with Roger Masters,
who was a very quirky, eccentric young political theorist but a very
thoughtful [and supportive] one. He was the one who advised my
dissertation.
Anderson: [00:41:58] What did you write about for your dissertation?
Keohane: Well, I was going to write on Benjamin Constant, which would have been a
good thing to do, on his concept of liberty--the liberty of the ancients and
the moderns, [a very important contribution to the development of
liberalism]. But I was easily discouraged, and I learned that a professor at
Brown was about to publish a book on Benjamin Constant. I [visited him at
Brown and he told me that it didn’t make sense to pursue my idea because

39

he had covered everything in his book]. So I thought, “Well, so that topic’s
taken.” [And nobody advised me and said, “Don’t worry]. Go ahead.
Whatever he says, you’ll have something important to say as well.”
I was--[and have always been]--especially interested in Rousseau, and
I chose to write on a figure who was [the subject of several key] footnotes in
Rousseau’s Social Contract, Le Marquis d’Argenson, cited several times by
Rousseau at the [point in his book where he sets out] the concept of the
volonté générale, the general will, which is [crucial to his theory]. So I thought,
“Who is this guy, and why was he so influential for Rousseau? What did he
actually say?”
[00:42:53] I wound up writing my doctoral thesis on the concept of
“democratic monarchy” created by René Louis d’Argenson. A rather
obscure thesis, [which I sensibly decided not to try to publish as a
monograph]; however, it was a really fun thesis to write; [he was a
fascinating guy and quite a creative thinker], and the thesis provided the
node of my big book on political philosophy in France.
Anderson: What ended up happening with you and Patrick?
Keohane: Well, it was another replay of the imbalances there were at that time. [We
were both named Sterling Fellows at Yale, and our final year] I got job
offers, tenure track offers at Yale, UNC Chapel Hill, and one other place.
Patrick got job offers at several places, but they didn’t include any of those,
and there was no overlap except for Reed College, where we both got
offers. So we went out to Reed, and we really didn’t find it that congenial.
He had an offer at Swarthmore, which he really wanted to take. I didn’t

40

have anything at Swarthmore, but I knew that it was a place where there
were really good political theorists. It was inconceivable at that time that I
would accept the offer at Yale or at Chapel Hill, and he would go to
Swarthmore [and we would commute, which would probably happen now].
People just didn’t do that.
[00:44:00] People always followed their husbands, particularly in a
couple with a child. So I went to Swarthmore as a replacement for a brilliant
political theorist on leave, Roland Pennock, and then they found that I was
helpful to them and put me on the tenure track as a starting assistant
professor. I was part-time at the beginning [by my own choice to have more
time for our little son Stephan] and found that was no use because I was
working at least as hard as anybody else and had no status and no pay. I
only was part-time for one year, then I got onto tenure track. So I went in
1967 with no real job, but I got one [after I was there].
Anderson: And what were you teaching when you were at Swarthmore?
Keohane: I should say, by the way, that our marriage--as I said, it was too soon, we
were too young, it was too quick. We didn’t really know each other that
well. [One factor that pulled us apart was] this experience of following him
to Yale, which was my choice, and I think it was a good one, but then also
following him to Swarthmore--I just felt he’s not fully engaged or
supportive as much as he may think he is in my career, in my own life.
[00:45:11] [Apart from that, there were a] variety of things in the
marriage I don’t need to go into, but anyway, our marriage had begun to

41

come apart, even before we got to Swarthmore. It became pretty clear that
this was not something that was best for both of us.
Anderson: So after you started teaching at Swarthmore, you guys separated?
Keohane: After about a year, yes. I think the second year I was there we separated and
then we decided to get divorced. But what did I teach? Swarthmore had a
track called honors and a track called course, and honors was where the top
students generally were enrolled. [The other more senior political theorists
were teaching those seminars for honors students], so I taught the students
in course. However, they were--you know, it was Swarthmore, after all-really thoughtful, bright students, and I loved teaching them. I taught
political theory, I taught comparative politics also, and I was very glad I’d
had some of that at Yale because that’s what they needed me to teach.
Anderson: [00:46:10] What was it like at Swarthmore at the time?
Keohane: Oh, it was a wonderful place to be. The students were superb, there was a
strong faculty fellowship. We had great parties. I mean, we would go to
dances at each other’s houses all the time. It was the late-1960s. People were
doing all kinds of things. We were dealing with the protests against the
Vietnam War, and I remember hanging over the balcony in Swarthmore in
the library late into the night listening to and taking part in a debate on what
we ought to do [at Swarthmore to protest the war]. So it was politically
vibrant, it was intellectually active, and it was socially really rewarding,
despite the fact that my marriage was dissolving.
Anderson: How did you feel about the war at the time?

42

Keohane: [00:46:58] Well, everybody that I knew thought the Vietnam War was a big
mistake. And I certainly thought that.
Anderson: Who was taking the other side of the debate?
Keohane: At Swarthmore, almost nobody. I mean, there must have been somebody,
but they weren’t very vocal. I’m sure there were, but not any of the people I
knew well. [We were arguing mostly about the best way to protest].
Anderson: So the culture of your department and the faculty more broadly was very-Keohane: Very liberal. Very liberal.
Anderson: It sounds like you made friendships outside of political theory--like you
were all very close.
Keohane: Oh yeah. It’s a small faculty. You know, everyone in the Political Science
Department, and many people in other fields. The faculty group, young
faculty our age, was very close, and that was a lot of fun. So I enjoyed those
years at Swarthmore.
Anderson: Besides just the fact of following your husband there and having to sort of
take a position last-minute, did you feel as though you faced any other
obstacles at Swarthmore because of your gender?
Keohane: [00:47:59] Oh, there was one specific one. In fact, it happened to be the
time that I first became aware of the values and the appeal of Robert
Keohane, who later became my husband. He was teaching as a very, very
bright young professor there--you know, talented whiz-kid who was going
to be the best international relations person around.
He’d been there already two years. He had gone to UC Berkeley to
teach in the summer [I arrived, had a tenure-track offer there and seriously]

43

thought of staying but decided to come back, for which we were both very
grateful [later when we got together]. So he appeared after I’d been there all
summer, and we both lived in a big house with half-a-dozen faculty
apartments [called 317 North Chester Road]. I remember meeting him [in
the back yard there]. He also had an office close to mine on the corridor
where Political Science was in Trotter Hall on campus.
[00:48:57] Anyway one day early in that first fall, [as we passed in the
hallway of Trotter], he said, “Are you going to Soscifac tonight?”
I said, “What’s a Soscifac?”
He said, “Don’t you know?”
I said no. He said, “Well, it’s the social science faculty meeting, and
all the social scientists come together once a month, somebody presents a
paper, and then we have wine and cheese and we talk and that’s the way we
bond. You’re not invited?”
And I said, “I never heard anything about it.”
So he went to the department chair and said, “What’s going on?”
And the guy said, “Well, we actually have a rule that part-time people
aren’t included.” And it just happened there were only two part-time people
in the department, and only two women, and we were the same. So the two
women were excluded by virtue of the fact that we were part-time.
And Bob said, “That’s ridiculous. If Enid and Nan can’t go, I’m not
going either.”
So [laughs] you know, they had to pay attention to that. And they
invited us because they knew Bob would then talk to other people too and

44

there might be a minor revolt among the junior faculty. I thought, “Wow,
this guy really gets it.” That was an important moment in my coming
awareness of how supportive he really was and how enlightened.
[00:50:06] But the other major instance of gender discrimination
happened much later. When Bob and I [were engaged to be married],
because I had already been a faculty member and, of course, he had too, we
assumed, I guess, that I would continue. But there was a nepotism rule that
nobody in a department at Swarthmore could be married to anybody else in
the department, and they were considering applying that rule to me
belatedly. One of my best friends from Yale graduate school, who also
taught at Swarthmore, went to them and said, “This is ridiculous. Nan has
been a very strong member of the faculty. She’s been here now for four
years and you’re going to knock her off just because she got married to
Bob?” And so they didn’t apply the rule. That would have been serious
discrimination, which I escaped. But you see what the rules were like.
Anderson: [00:50:58] Sounds like they had excuses to treat women less well.
Keohane: And it was just the way it was. But you’ll probably ask, “Was there any
awareness among Swarthmore women that this was going on?” [That
awareness didn’t begin to happen] until the very end of my time at
Swarthmore. One of the old-school, long-serving female French professors
whom I had always admired but didn’t know very well, Jean Perkins, called
all the women faculty at Swarthmore into her office. There were so few of
us that we could all fit in her office, which is something in itself. So we all
crammed into her office, and she said, “I want us to be aware of how this

45

place, which is so proud of being coeducational and seems so welcoming in
many ways, is actually treating women unfairly. In many ways, I think each
of us has been discriminated against. It’s time for us to talk about it.”
[00:51:54] And we did. For the first time, women at Swarthmore
began to really share information on this, but it was my last semester there,
so I didn’t form part of any movement. But at Swarthmore, that was the
way in which the enlightenment came.
Anderson: Do you know what came of that after you left?
Keohane: No, I don’t. I lost track. I became very focused on Stanford.
Anderson: I just wanted to circle back and ask a little bit more about kind of how you
met Bob initially and how you guys grew to be close. I mean, that one event
sounds really formative, but I wonder how it started.
Keohane: Well, there were other events like that. I mean, he was so bright and he was
so supportive and he was so clever in meetings and such a warm friend. And
so we grew closer and closer. His marriage was also facing difficulties--our
marriages both began to come apart before we fell in love, but as we fell in
love at a time our marriages were breaking up, we were aware that this was
something that was really important to both [of us].
[00:53:12] But mostly he’s just so wonderful and he was so clever and
so supportive and funny and thoughtful. And I’d never met anybody like
him.
Anderson: And how would you say that your relationship with him has influenced you
personally?
Keohane: How can I begin to say that? I mean, profoundly.

46

Anderson: Especially in your future choices about your career.
Keohane: Well, at the time, we were both, of course, at Swarthmore, but only for a
year or two. We went on leave to Harvard together the year after we got
married, year-and-a-half actually. He went with me to France in May, that
summer 1971 after we were married in December 1970, to do research on
my book; he didn’t have any professional reason to be in France for the
summer, but he thought it [was crucial, and rewarding] to be there with me.
We were married and-Anderson: [00:54:10] So he followed you.
Keohane: I was pregnant and [we went together]. He was willing to go to France and
spent time, you know, poking about Paris and working on his own papers,
but he didn’t have to do that, and he did. He wanted to. We would never
have considered his not doing it, and that to me was emblematic of the way
he was going to approach our life. So we spent six weeks, wonderful weeks,
in Paris, doing research and writing, and traveling around France.
Then the next year, the year our son Nathaniel was born, we went to
Harvard on leave and lived in Belmont and in West Newton and traveled in
to Harvard, and we both had a wonderful experience there. I was invited by
Stanley Hoffman to be a fellow at the Center for European Studies; we were
both treated well at Harvard, and we both got a lot of work done. [Widener
Library was a great place to do research in my field]. So that shared life was a
pattern from the very beginning of the way we lived.
[00:55:11] This gets ahead of the game of what you’re talking about
right now, but the invitation came that fall while we were on leave at Harvard

47

to come to Stanford and be interviewed. And we were, and it was so
beautiful. It was November, and you can imagine what it was like in Boston
and what it was like here. We fell in love with the Bay Area and with
Stanford. They wanted very much for Bob to come and found a new
international relations program, which was a huge opportunity for him. He
had tenure, so of course they invited him to come as a tenured professor.
Once again, at first, there wasn’t anything for me, but there was something
that worked out. We can come back to this later, but the point is he made
very clear that he wasn’t coming unless there was something that worked out
for me.
[00:55:59] That’s pretty common now with two-body problems. At the
time, it was quite unusual, so they thought, “Ooh.” Then they also saw that I
had a strong record at Swarthmore. I had published a couple of good articles,
I was a very good teacher, but they wouldn’t have looked at me if Bob hadn’t
said, “I’m not coming unless something rewarding works out for Nan.”
Anderson: We’re going to take a break in a second, right before we talk about Stanford,
but I was wondering how you managed to balance your career with having a
family, because that’s something that’s often really difficult to do. I assume
Bob being supportive was really helpful for that.
Keohane: Absolutely. I mean, it was a very egalitarian marriage. It was very different
from my first marriage when I wound up being the part-time person doing
all the work. Patrick was not unwilling, it was just not part of his life to
think, “Well maybe I should take Stephan to the pediatrician.”
[00:57:00] So that was a very different pattern. But from the

48

beginning, Bob and I knew that our relationship would be egalitarian, and
we talked about it, but it wasn’t even so much we had to talk about it. That
was the way it would be. And it was. We shared duties and divided up the
work. This leaps way ahead, but there was one point at Stanford when we
were both working really hard, and I was working for tenure and he was
deeply involved in founding his program. Nathaniel was little and we each
had kids by our earlier marriage who spent a good deal of time with us, so
we had a lot of things on our plates.
We’ll come back to how that worked, but there was one time we
were both feeling pretty exhausted, and so we both sort of had this
assumption that the other one wasn’t quite doing their share, so we decided
we’d do a time and motion study. We would keep a record of all the things
that we did for the household.
[00:57:55] We did that, and at the end of the two weeks, we looked at
the record, and it was very clear that each of us was doing lots of things the
other one wasn’t even aware of and that we were certainly doing equal
amounts. It’s just that we weren’t aware of all the things the other one was
doing because they weren’t all visible, we weren’t doing them right in front
of each other. It became very clear that we did do equal amounts of work,
and we’ve never looked back on that. Although Bob did think it was a little
weird that I counted it in my column as family work that I took Nat and his
closest friend to Disney World for the weekend. [laughter] But it was with
the family, right. I was with them, and he was traveling to do something
really crucial at a conference, so anyway.

49

In other words, yes, it was a very egalitarian marriage, and I could
never have done it otherwise.
Anderson: In terms of this balance, too, can you tell me a little bit about what family
planning options were available and how you all dealt with that?
Keohane: [00:59:02] Well, it was the time of the pill. Life would have been very
different without the pill. We had decided we wanted to have a child of the
two of us, and we did that fairly soon after we got married because we were
both moving on in years. I was in my early-30s and we didn’t want to wait
forever. We really wanted to have a child. But once we had a child--and also
had others that we were responsible for and loved deeply--we figured that
was it. We were lucky the family planning worked.
Anderson: So did you each have one child from your previous marriages?
Keohane: [Bob] had two and I had one, but one of his was a boy who was exactly the
same age as my older son, and the three boys lived with us almost all of the
time when they were growing up. Sarah, my daughter--I think of her as my
daughter even though she’s my stepdaughter--mostly lived with her
[mother] in Kentucky, but she spent summers and some holidays with us.
Jonathan sometimes lived with his mother when he was really little, but the
school was not very good, so he came to live with us in Stanford. And
Stephan lived with his father one year, but most of the time lived with us. So
most of our lives, we were raising three boys.
Anderson: [01:00:11] Can you tell me a little bit more about the kids and how it felt to
be a parent at the time?

50

Keohane: Oh, I loved being a parent. I mean, I shouldn’t be sentimental about this.
It’s also real work. I mean, there’s a lot to being a parent. It’s very
complicated. But we found it very rewarding. I don’t know what to tell you
about the kids. They were all wonderful. They were quite different. I don’t
know how much that’s relevant. Is it relevant? You just want to know?
Anderson: Yes, I want to know.
Keohane: Sarah is very much like her father. She’s very smart, very decisive, she gets
things done. She is now CEO of a [non-profit, FCLTGlobal, that seeks to
persuade corporations to take a longer-term view rather than responding to
demands for short-term results]. She was a managing partner at Wellington,
also worked at McKinsey [and Goldman Sachs previously] and she’s a real
go-getter, and she was from the time she was four.
[01:01:11] I can remember one Easter Egg hunt in the back yard at
[317 North Chester Road in Swarthmore] where our boys and Sarah showed
their personalities amazingly. Sarah stood at the bottom of the stairs on the
fire escape and directed everybody saying, “There’s an egg over there. See,
you missed that one.” We have pictures of her doing this. And Jonathan,
who is now an astrophysicist, [tenured at a liberal arts] college in Virginia.
He’s always been a little bit spacey, and so [at the Easter Egg Hunt], he was
wandering around, looking at the sky, having found no eggs, right, you
know. [laughs]
[01:01:58] Stephan [now teaches drama and English in high school in
Battleground, Washington, and his little troupe of students has been invited
to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival]. At the Easter Egg hunt, he was

51

purposefully going from place to place looking for the eggs and finding
them. The three kids were all so different, but they were wonderful kids and
they got along quite well. We did a lot of things together as a family. Nat in
his own time, became a real individual and is still, [as Senior Vice-President
for Climate at the Environmental Defense Fund]. I’ll never forget riding
him to the daycare center in the little bike seat on the back of my bike at
Stanford. Usually our pattern was I would take him in the morning and Bob
would spend time with him after school.
And so I was taking him to school, to daycare, and we were riding
along Campus Drive, and it was a really busy day. This street didn’t have all
the construction it does now, but it was crowded, and I was trying to
maneuver very carefully. There wasn’t such a good bike lane then, so I was
worried about the traffic, but Nat being [three or four years old] was asking
me all these questions like, “Mommy, why is this?” or, “Mommy, what is
that?” And I tried to give answers and then I gradually lost the ability to do
that. I had to focus, and I said, “I’m sorry, Nat, I don’t know. I don’t
know.” I said it about three times. He said, “I don’t want to live in a family
where the mommy doesn’t know things.” [laughter]
I don’t want to live in a family where the mommy doesn’t know
things. It was amazing. They’re all individuals of great strength and character
and foibles. Like all the rest of us, they have many of their parents’ strengths
and some of our weaknesses, of course, but they’re dear, dear kids, we were
a very happy family, and we love them. And they each have kids of their
own.

52

[break]
Anderson: We were just talking about your family, and I want to move on now to
talking about your time at Stanford. So we talked a little bit about how you
ended up at Stanford, but can you say a little bit more about how you and
your husband transitioned from Swarthmore to Stanford?
Keohane: [01:04:08] I will be glad to do that, although one thing I hope we can come
back to, maybe next time, you ask about my family. You didn’t ask about
my brother and sister, to whom I’m very close, and they’ve been a very
important part of my life, so we’ll come back to that.
Anderson: Yes, I’ll make sure to ask you about that.
Keohane: But now you want to think about Stanford. As I said, we were on leave at
Harvard and having a very good experience getting a lot of work done and
enjoying being parents of a funny, sweet little, chunky little boy. We came
out to Stanford to be interviewed and Bob was offered this job in the spring
of 1973, and I did have an offer as well. Perhaps someone at Swarthmore
spoke up for me or maybe they just checked into my record and figured
there was something valuable I might contribute so they gave me an
opportunity to start again as an instructor.
[01:05:02] And I did, although I was already in my fourth year [of a
tenure-track job] at Swarthmore, but I felt lucky to have a job and for us to
be there together. At the beginning, therefore, I was very much not involved
in many of the things at Stanford that later became important to me. A lot
of the work that I was focused on was my teaching, which I loved, and my
time as a mother and a wife and a family member. So those were the things

53

that sort of dominated our first few years.
Luckily for us, in terms of how we negotiated things, my mother-inlaw, Bob’s mother, Mary Pieters Keohane, had been someone I admired and
liked from the time I had met her. Her husband passed away at the same
time we took the Stanford job, and she had always wanted to live in
California. She’d gotten a degree at Berkeley, an MA, [wrote several
textbooks in social sciences for high school students, taught high school and
then was a college professor, rather like my own mom]. She wanted to come
back out and be with us in California, so she came and lived in Sharon
Heights, where she couldn’t afford to live now, I’m sure, but at the time, it
was just a suburban place to live.
[01:08:14] She had her own life, she was a docent in several
museums, and she wrote, but she was available if we needed her. If one of
the kids was sick or if we wanted to go off on a weekend for just the two of
us, just to have time together, she was there. The kids loved her and they
had a great relationship with her, and so it was a blessing for us that she was
there. It made our lives much easier. Most of the work, of course, the two
of us did together, but the fact that she was there in the emergency [brought
significant] peace of mind, even if it wasn’t always something we called on.
[01:06:54] So anyway, we started work at Stanford, and I was teaching
courses in political theory. There weren’t many people [specializing in my
field]--there were very few graduate students in political theory. Stanford
was not a place you would come to do political theory, but there were a lot
of undergraduate courses. I taught the European Roots of American

54

Democratic Thought, which was a course for Bob’s program in
international relations, Bob and David Kennedy. I taught History of
Political Thought to graduate students as well as undergraduates. I don’t
think I ever taught comparative politics here. I taught several courses in
political theory, enjoyed them a lot. They became popular.
One thing that I remember is the people who were here as
Professional Journalism Fellows, who really liked my course and it got a
reputation of being a must-take course for the journalists who came. So
every year, we would have this cohort of middle-aged distinguished
journalists who were at Stanford, were taking my course and had great
questions.
Anderson: Which course is this?
Keohane: [01:07:58] This probably was the European Roots of American Democratic
Thought, but it might have been the History of Political Theory. I don’t
know, one of my larger lecture courses they took, and they were a
wonderful cohort. I became close to a couple of them and visited them in
their hometowns. Anyway, things like that made Stanford teaching very
rewarding. Of course, Stanford students are wonderful, and I enjoyed both
the undergraduates and the graduates a lot.
I became close to some members of our department, but more to
people in other departments whom Bob and I got to know as couples or
who were in cognate fields--historians, particularly an English professor. We
had a book group of some pretty interesting professors that met once a

55

month. So we became close to a number of professors here, not by any
means all of them in Political Science.
Anderson: [01:08:54] Can you describe what Stanford was like when you first got here
and what kind of struck you? I know you mentioned how nice it was
compared to the East Coast.
Keohane: “How beautiful!” was the first thing. What else struck us? It seemed a lot
more relaxed than Swarthmore. Swarthmore was so intense intellectually,
which is wonderful, but Stanford people took their work seriously yet they
didn’t obsess about it, and I found that refreshing. Also the fact that people
would work even on these gorgeous days. The first few days, we would say,
“How does anybody ever get any work done?” We were told, “Well, there
will be more gorgeous days, so when we have to work, we work.” And we
thought that’s impossible; nobody must ever work here. However, we
discovered that that’s true, and we got into the groove. I also found that
Stanford had a much more cosmopolitan feel if you take into account also
San Francisco.
[01:09:56] Swarthmore was very much part of the Philadelphia area
geographically, but intellectually it wasn’t really pulled to Philly. I should
have mentioned, by the way, while I was at Swarthmore, I was invited to
come and teach a political theory graduate seminar at Penn because they
didn’t have many political theorists at Penn. The faculty thought there ought
to be somebody around doing political theory, but they didn’t have anybody
there who was doing it as a first priority. So they invited me to come in for
maybe two years and teach political theory to graduate students at Penn.

56

And I really enjoyed going in to Philadelphia. I would go to museums, I
would travel in on the train, I made some friends there, although nobody in
Poli Sci seemed to know I was around, but I met some other people. And
so that was important to me so that I knew that being at a bigger university
was something that was going to be mind-expanding, and indeed it was.
[01:10:50] Because Swarthmore, for all its strengths, was a very close
little place. As I’ve said, we all went to the same parties, our kids all played
together, and it was a very close little group. Stanford was much more
expansive, there were lots more different people to get to know, lots more
things going on, and then we loved San Francisco. So it was this sort of
mind-expanding opportunity for us.
Anderson: You said a little bit about this, but I just wanted to know what the nature of
your first position was when you first showed up. Were you satisfied with
that and then how did it change over time as you kept teaching?
Keohane: I started as an instructor and then was made a tenure track assistant
professor in my second year. I think they gave me a position partly because
they wanted Bob and partly because they had read my work and thought I
had a good reputation as a teacher and I might contribute.,
Anderson: If you started as an instructor, then you must have been very successful and
then they quickly moved you to the other role.
Keohane: The next year , I was a tenure track assistant professor.
Anderson: And how did your department and your faculty colleagues receive you
during those first few years?

57

Keohane: People were quite warm. There was a senior political theorist, Charles
Drekmeier, who I think was glad to have a young colleague, the first time in
quite a while, but he was off in his own world. He and I were very different,
we had very different ways to approach political theory. So I didn’t become
particularly close to him, but he was welcoming.
[01:13:00] And as I said, many of our friends were not in Political
Science, but we were certainly well-received. It wasn’t as though people
thought political theory was a weird thing to do; it just wasn’t very
important at Stanford.
Anderson: So Stanford didn’t have much of reputation for political theory, but you still
felt like it was a good place to be for the work you were doing.
Keohane: Well, it was a good place to be for teaching. It was great to do the teaching
because undergraduates particularly really enjoyed my courses, and I enjoyed
teaching them. I did get to teach a few graduate seminars, but there were
just not many graduate students. Graduate students who came for other
subfields would take political theory, but I only had responsibility for
advising one graduate student, and he was mostly with Drekmeier the whole
time I was here. So one thing I didn’t have was graduate students. I never
have had for a variety of reasons. That I now recognize would have been
good, but it was not part of what happened at Stanford because people
didn’t come to do graduate work in political theory.
Anderson: [01:14:01] And was it difficult to not have a larger cluster of people to work
with when you were doing your own research or were you able to find
people in other places?

58

Keohane: I’m a loner, [in terms of my research]. I was working on my big book on
French political thought.
Anderson: Yes.
Keohane: I had a wonderful group of political theory colleagues across the country
whom I had come to be part of back in Swarthmore. There was a
Conference for the Study of Political Thought, a group composed of
professors doing political theory. Those people became very good friends of
mine; we would go for meetings [in the NYC/Philly area] several times a
year and then go to a conference somewhere once a year. I kept doing that,
and that was where my political theory colleagueship came from. It was very
rich and very important. There was also a Bay Area group of political
theorists who got together because there were a lot of strong political
theorists at Berkeley and at Santa Cruz. So we met at least a couple of times
a semester.
[01:15:06] It was easier in those days to commute from Berkeley or
Santa Cruz to here than it is now because the traffic was much lighter. I
remember going up to Berkeley regularly for political theory meetings. So
my colleagues in political theory were not at Stanford. They were in the
Conference for the Study of Political Thought back east or they were in this
rich group in the Bay Area, and that was quite rewarding.
Anderson: Did you find your friends here at Stanford from other departments to have
an influence on your work at all or were those mostly friendships that were
separate from your academic work?

59

Keohane: In the period we’re now discussing, it was mostly friendships. Once we get
into the issue of Feminist Studies, those colleagues were profoundly
influential, but we’re starting at the beginning and I wasn’t there yet.
Anderson: Because your husband was also a professor, did you ever feel any pressure,
not from your husband of course, but from other people to sort of fulfill
this stereotypical “faculty wife” role despite the fact that you were also a
professor?
Keohane: [01:16:04] Never. Never. There was never any stereotypical faculty wife role
that was imposed on me. There were a few other couples who were both
teaching, and that was the model that we were sort of placed into. That was
the category people fit us into, so I never was expected to do any faculty
wife business, or if I was, I ignored it. I was invited to the Campus Club, a
welcoming group of wives of faculty members [and some women faculty],
but nobody really expected me to come. I did once or twice, just to be warm
and friendly, but nobody put any pressure on.
Anderson: So I wanted to talk a little bit about your department more specifically,
although we’ve already covered a lot of this.
Keohane: Can I go back for a minute, because you asked an unexpected question.
Nobody’s ever asked me that before. I do recall that some of the people
who were most welcoming to me were other faculty wives in Political
Science, particularly Dorothea Almond, and then Phyllis Craig from History.
[01:17:08] These were faculty wives who did not themselves have
professional jobs, but who were very interested in daycare. They had started
a daycare center, and they really liked Bob and me. They welcomed me quite

60

warmly as a friend. They were faculty wives, and that was very important in
my life, but they didn’t expect me to behave like a faculty wife. There was
no way they were behaving simply like faculty wives either. They were doing
their thing, which was powerful; they were an important group of friends.
Anderson: So it was just very much a positive and welcoming thing.
Keohane: Very much positive. Absolutely, yes.
Anderson: It sounds to me like your department was just very small. Would you
describe the people you were involved with to have a certain culture or what
was it like?
Keohane: [01:18:05] Well, there were just very few of them. The department wasn’t
small, but the subset of political theorists was small. There were a couple of
other people, but they weren’t deeply engaged--[Yosal Rogat was one of
them who was interesting to know]. But Charles Drekmeier was by far the
most important member of the group, and there were a couple of other
people who were somewhat more peripheral or engaged in other activities,
so that group was not unwelcoming, but not that important for me
intellectually.
Anderson: So you all were under the broader Political Science umbrella.
Keohane: Yes.
Anderson: That makes sense. Did you ever know any women who didn’t feel like they
were a part of the camaraderie of the department?
Keohane: There weren’t any [women in the department].
Anderson: There weren’t any women.

61

Keohane: [01:18:56] [There were no senior, tenured members of the Poli Sci faculty]. I
don’t even remember what junior women there may have been [in other
parts of the department; there were very few]. But I don’t remember feeling
excluded because I was a woman. I mean, there was nothing like “we’re not
inviting you to Soscifac” or “we’re not imposing a nepotism rule.” It was
more like, “Okay, you’re a member of the faculty, you’re a junior member of
the faculty, you do what junior members of the faculty do.” There wasn’t
any sense that I was different because I was a woman, at least in retrospect.
Maybe I felt something at the time, but it certainly was not something that
stayed with me.
Anderson: So this is really different than how things were at Swarthmore then.
Keohane: Yes. Yes. That’s true. Of course, it’s a much bigger place, and I was a much
smaller, little cog because there were so many more people around, and I
was a beginning, minor person. But nobody was saying I had to behave in a
certain way because I was a woman. I don’t think that ever happened at
Stanford, and that is notable. That’s interesting.
Anderson: Were there any other major differences that you felt, moving from
Swarthmore to here?
Keohane: [01:20:00] Well, one big change was at Swarthmore, although we were
expected to do research and I did research--I wrote a couple of good papers
and did a lot of work getting on with my book--the main thing was teaching.
That was what was emphasized, that’s what was rewarded.
When I got here, it became pretty clear that all the messages were,
“Well, we like for people to teach well and you’re doing really well”--I won a

62

teaching award early in my time here--“but in terms of tenure, research is
what’s really important at [Stanford] too, so don’t forget.” And that message
came through very clearly, very different from Swarthmore where [it was]
“Research, it’s important that you do it, it’s nice you’re doing well, but
teaching is what we’re all about at Swarthmore.” At Stanford, it was like
“Teaching matters, these are wonderful students, we’re glad you’re here, but
your research has to come first.”
Anderson: So the teaching here had to be a little bit more self-motivated maybe,
because the university isn’t pushing you as much?
Keohane: [01:21:02] That’s a good way to put it. It’s not as though anyone was
preventing me from spending time on my teaching. It’s just that it was very
clear that when the time came for tenure, the teaching would matter, but the
research would matter much more, and that was not the message
Swarthmore was sending.
Anderson: What was your progress towards tenure like during your years at Stanford?
Keohane: Well, once I got the message that I really should be paying more attention to
my research, I buckled down and worked very hard on this book on France.
We went back to France briefly for some more research another summer. I
wrote as often as I could. The great blessing there was I was a fellow up at
the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in 1978-1979, just
as I was ready to do the last major writing of the book.
[01:22:04] I didn’t have to teach that year, and we had good childcare,
and Bob’s mom was here. I could really focus in on getting the big book
written. But I did a lot of work on it before that, especially research, but that

63

was the year that the writing came together. If I hadn’t had that fellowship,
things would have been much harder. But I knew my teaching was going to
look good and I knew I cared about it. I had done some service, although
nothing major, but nobody asked me to do anything that I said no to. And I
concentrated a lot on the research. It made for some tensions because I was,
like most people, anxious about whether I would get tenure and feeling like
I really needed more time to do my work. I think that was the context in
which we decided to do our time and motion study because I felt I wasn’t
getting enough time to do my own research, and we discovered we were
both doing equal amounts.
[01:22:58] But [Stanford] was a good place to do it. I could work
between terms, I could work in the summer, and I could bunch up my
courses some years so that I would have a period when I could write, but it
was mainly that year at the Center that I pulled it all together.
Anderson: So I wanted to also talk a little bit about your extracurricular involvements
at Stanford. We will circle back to teaching and research more later on. I
know you were on the Stanford Faculty Senate. I think you actually chaired
it during your time here?
Keohane: I don’t even know when I was first elected to the Senate. I must have been
elected several years before 1979 because I was visible enough to be made
chair, but I don’t remember exactly when. But for whatever reason, I was
elected to the Faculty Senate, and I found that rewarding. I enjoyed the
Faculty Senate. I found the discussions really interesting. That would have
been an important part of my extracurricular life for several years.

64

[01:24:02] Much of it, though, was in the part we haven’t talked
about, which is Feminist Studies. That’s where most of my efforts outside
my teaching and research took place--although it was relevant for my
teaching and research because I started teaching feminist theory courses and
I began to think about feminist research. So that wasn’t entirely
extracurricular.
Anderson: Can you remember any of the issues that you worked on as part of the
Senate that were particularly salient or interesting?
Keohane: Well, I remember one of the things that I worked on, not only through the
Senate, was the Western Culture program.
Anderson: Oh yes. That was controversial, right?
Keohane: That’s right, very controversial. I was one of the small committee that was
asked to design a Western Culture program. I don’t even remember which
year it was, but that was a very important commitment, and I found that
totally fascinating. We had long arguments at the Faculty Club. Amicable,
but clearly arguments about what should be taught and how much people
should have to stick to the same reading list and how much they could make
their own choices, and it was a very interesting discussion.
[01:25:14] And the fact that in the end we could agree on a Western
Culture program and present it to the faculty and have it accepted was an
important achievement. That took a lot of time and thought because people
had very different views, not only on the committee, but in the university as
a whole, [since] it was going to be a requirement. Everybody had views as to
what should be included, and we had to sort those through and sift them

65

out and decide what we thought was the right answer.
I remember one thing I really stood up for was having--this sounds
so paltry now--having at least one woman [author] on the list. I had to fight
for that.
Anderson: Oh my gosh.
Keohane: I mean, “Only one?” is what you would say now, but I remember I finally
got Jane Austen or Virginia Woolf on the list. I had to fight for that, and I
fought really hard. [laughter]
[01:26:02] But it was mostly about which of the Greek philosophers,
which of the Bible, Plato, Shakespeare--it was a fascinating discussion. So
that was a major commitment.
Anderson: We’ve recently had similar controversies over our optional Western Culture
program.
Keohane: This is what I hear.
Anderson:

At the time you were working on it, was there backlash from students who
felt, for one reason or another, like Western Culture was like too narrow or
limiting?

Keohane: I don’t remember that. I think students had had no experience with it, and if
it was something they were told they were going to take, they were going to
take it. I mean, it wasn’t as though it was an imposition or a burden. It was
one course. The most backlash came from faculty who thought either there
should not be such a required course or, even more often, they felt very
strongly that certain persons or certain books should be in it. So that was
where the intellectual vitality and vigor came from. The students, as far as I

66

recall, were receptive or at least not fundamentally opposed. They didn’t
know what it would feel like.
Anderson: [01:27:13] So the biggest argument was about “there’s only so many authors
you can get in there and who should we put?”
Keohane: That’s right. Who would be included? That was the big argument, yes.
Anderson: So I want to talk about Feminist Studies now. How did you get involved
with the Feminist Studies program, and why was this important to you at
the time that you were working on it?
Keohane: I got here in 1973; the Center for Research on Women (CROW) was
founded about that time, and people like Myra Strober and Diane
Middlebrook and Shelly Rosaldo [Michelle Zimbalist Rosaldo], who were
involved in the Center for Research on Women--Myra Strober above all,
who was the director of the center--had a very good idea of pulling faculty
members together to talk about research on women’s studies.
[01:28:12] I don’t know exactly whose idea it was. I think the
invitation may have come from Diane or Myra. I don’t even know why I
was included except I believe there was a point, maybe in 1975, after I’d
been here a year or two, when people were thinking: instead of just looking
at the small handful of faculty who’d done any published work on women’s
studies, we ought to reach out to other faculty members who might be
interested, young faculty members, women here at Stanford particularly,
who might be interested in what we’re doing. And they included me.
So I started going to these discussion groups, and I found them
totally fascinating. I’d never thought about some of these issues. [As was

67

true for many of us in the group], it made me realize how thinking seriously
about women might fundamentally transform my own field. It would be like
a total earthquake, and I had never thought of that before.
[01:29:09] It was a very powerful intellectual experience, and hearing
other women go through the same thought process and say, “Wait, if we
thought about women in history, what would we write about that we’ve
never written about before? Or women in biology?” And we were sharing
that sense, and that was really exciting. That was true for a couple of years,
and then we thought about putting together what we were doing in a formal
disciplinary program, and we argued about whether to call it Women’s
Studies or Feminist Studies; that was also an exhilarating and challenging
moment. But the group of people who’d been pulled together by CROW
and who turned then to form Feminist Studies became my closest friends
here by far and my real sisterhood intellectually.
[01:29:56] I wound up spending more and more time with them and
less and less time in the department. Not that I was falling down on my job.
I was still teaching, but I didn’t get as involved in department affairs. I was
deeply involved in CROW and Feminist Studies. It started when somebody
just sent out an invitation to a few of us saying, “Hope you might come to
this monthly discussion group where we talk about research on women.”
And partly because of Wellesley and St. Anne’s and partly because of what
had happened at the end at Swarthmore, I was receptive because I thought-and partly because of Yale, God knows--there are reasons to have issues
here, and I’d be interested to be talk about it even though it was nothing to

68

do with my research at that point. Somehow they sensed I would be
receptive. So I came and got totally drawn in.
Anderson: Would you say this was somewhat of an epiphany or turning point for you?
Keohane: Absolutely.
Anderson: You’d already thought about how being a woman impacted your personal
life in these institutions.
Keohane: But never professionally.
Anderson: But now you’re thinking about research and thinking about how women
would change research? Is that the difference?
Keohane: [01:31:01] That’s right. Epiphany is not too strong a word. It was a real
turning point, I think for every one of us. And after it, you know, here I was
still working on the book on seventeenth-century France, still very dedicated
to it, but there were no women in that book, and I became more and more
conscious of that. As I published it, as I sent it to the publisher in 1979, I
wrote a preface in which I dedicated the book to my mother with the tribute
to all she did and how smart and thoughtful she was, but she never had a
chance to write her own book. So I was only aware at the very end of the
anomaly that here I was getting passionately involved in thinking about
research on women, but I was writing a book in which there was not a
woman to be seen.

69

Anderson: That’s really special that you set aside the preface for your mom.2 Can you
say a little bit about this women’s studies versus feminist studies debate?
What were people thinking on the other side of that?
Keohane: [01:32:01] Yes, just to summarize a little, it was a much more common
phrase to use--”women’s studies.” At that time, nobody was using “gender
studies,” so we didn’t consider that, and it wouldn’t have been what we had
in mind, and women’s studies was the obvious choice; we’d just started
doing women’s studies anywhere in the world. And insofar as there were
women’s studies programs, that’s what they were called.
But we felt what we were really doing was “feminist studies” in the
sense that the work we had been doing together transformed our disciplines.
It wasn’t just that we were adding women [as a peripheral topic to the
existing] disciplines. We were transforming the disciplines by having them
look at the world composed of two sexes, and it was profoundly
revolutionary for our disciplines, not just studying women. So we wanted to
signal that, and that’s why for some of us, Feminist Studies was a major
commitment that we wanted to make the administration understand.
[01:33:02] It would have been much more simple just to call it
Women’s Studies. Almost nobody would have objected to that, there were
new women’s studies programs almost everywhere. But we wanted to say,
“This is not just the study of women. This is an approach to knowledge-which transforms disciplines. We can show you. It has happened to us, and
we want to call our program that.”
Note from Nannerl Keohane: It wasn’t just the preface that was set aside. I said in the preface that I was
dedicating the whole book to my mother.
2

70

Anderson: That makes a lot of sense. It sounds like you knew that pushing for
“feminist studies” instead of “women’s studies” would result in a little bit
more opposition.
Keohane: Not a little more.
Anderson: A lot more, then.
Keohane: Well, some more. I mean, to be fair, Don Kennedy [Donald Kennedy] and
Dick Lyman [Richard W. Lyman] were supportive of what we were doing,
and Dick Lyman’s wife, Jing Lyman, was a very strongly-involved person.
So we had sympathy from the administration, but they had to explain to
other people like the Board of Trustees why we had this thing called
Feminist Studies. It sounds so ideological, it sounds so partisan, it sounds
like they’re going out in the street and burning bras.
[01:34:05] And so they had to explain why we felt so strongly, but
they accepted it once it became clear that we did feel strongly. To their
credit. It could have been easy for them to say, “Look, you can have this
program, but you cannot call it Feminist Studies because people will assume
you’re doing partisan work here.” And in the end, if that had been the
choice, we would have had to accept it, but we made a strong case and they
accepted that.
Anderson: Along the way, what obstacles did you face? Like, was it hard to persuade
the Board of Trustees?
Keohane: We didn’t have to do it.
Anderson: You didn’t have to do it.

71

Keohane: I have no idea how hard it was for [the Lymans and Don Kennedy] but we
didn’t have a terribly hard time persuading those leaders, partly because the
Center for Research on Women had already begun to do interesting work
and attract people from all over the campus, and partly because almost all
the lively, promising, bright young women faculty in the university were in
this program. And if you’d said no to all of us and made us feel like the
place didn’t value us, that would have been a major problem.
[01:35:01] Just not delusions of a few of us, right? We were twelve,
fourteen people strong, and more who were interested although not as
deeply involved. If we were going to be committed to it and they wanted us
to feel valued at Stanford, they had to pay some attention at least. Because
there were so many of us, and we were so deeply engaged in it, so
passionate about it.
Anderson: Sounds like from the perspective of the university, they knew you were
doing interesting work and you all were so important to them, so it made
sense.
Keohane: That may have been. I never thought about it that way. I guess it probably
did have a bit of that flavor, but it was more that they respected our take on
what we were doing because they respected us as scholars, and when we said,
“This really is important,” they, after pushing back for a while, said okay.
Anderson: Did you ever feel like there were people who didn’t take what you were
trying to do seriously?
Keohane: [01:35:56] Oh, there probably were, but we didn’t pay much attention to
them. They didn’t make our lives difficult. We went right on and did it.

72

Anderson: Even to this day Feminist Studies is still kind of an interdisciplinary program
and not a department.
Keohane: Right.
Anderson: Do you think that there’s any problems with that, or does that make it more
difficult in some ways?
Keohane: I don’t know because I’m not up to speed on what’s actually happening here
at Stanford in that area. I know in other universities I’ve been part of,
there’s always this tension between “should it be a program or should it be a
department. Should it have hiring capacity or should it bring people together
from different fields?” But we began, as you implied, as an interdisciplinary
set of folks, and we all wanted to be involved and we weren’t going to leave
our departments. I think there were times at which people said it would be
really helpful if we could have one dedicated faculty line for Feminist
Studies. But it wasn’t as important as having the opportunity to teach what
we wanted to teach and to get together to plan it.
Anderson: [01:37:02] And your departments didn’t mind you teaching Feminist Studies
courses?
Keohane: Well, I guess not. I mean, as I said, political theory was so peripheral to
Political Science they probably didn’t know the difference. I’d been doing
one weird thing and now I was doing another weird thing. [laughter]
Seriously. I mean, it’s not quite like that, but it almost is. I was doing
things that they thought were only vaguely related to political science
already, so what’s new?

73

Anderson: So I wanted to also ask a little bit more generally, the feminist movement
during the 1970s was really strong, and I wanted to know how this larger
movement influenced you personally during your time at Stanford.
Keohane: [01:37:50] Well, it’s hard to separate what I was doing personally and what I
was doing professionally from how I was being influenced. I’m sure my
views were becoming very much more weighted toward taking women’s
issues seriously politically--but I mean, I didn’t become more politically
involved or anything. It was more that it shaped me intellectually and
through my friendships and my personal colleagueships than that it
suddenly--. I certainly became a feminist. I was very well aware and quite
glad to say that. But all the influence was deep in my personal and
professional life. It wasn’t an independent factor.
Anderson: And did you feel like it shaped the campus culture more broadly? Do you
remember there being activism surrounding feminist issues like sexual
assault or abortion going on at Stanford?
Keohane: Yes, there were things like Take Back the Night, I haven’t really thought
about sequence. I don’t know whether things like Take Back the Night
happened while I was at Stanford or only later. So I don’t know exactly what
movements I could ascribe to the 1970s.
[01:39:00] I know that second-wave feminism was a major national
force, and we knew ourselves to be one of the main nodes of it, but that was
expressed in what we were doing, what we were teaching, what we were
writing, the way we were interacting together. Some of my colleagues spent
more time thinking about issues like battered women or poor women or

74

women of color than I did because I’ve always been a theorist. And I’m sure
that some of my colleagues did have it spill over more into their personal
commitment and their political activism. But both because I’m a theorist
and because I was so caught up in writing my book and taking care of our
kids and being a loving wife, I didn’t spend a lot of time on anything else at
that point, for better or for worse.
Anderson: It also sounds like these relationships that you had when you were working
on the Feminist Studies Program were also just really, really great
friendships.
Keohane: Oh, they were deep friendships, yes.
Anderson: [01:40:00] I wanted to hear a little bit more about these people because it
seems like they’re very important to you.
Keohane: We just had a reunion. We had a reunion of what we call the “old guard” at
the Faculty Club earlier this week, and it was a wonderful gathering of about
twelve of us. Ten or twelve of us around a table in a private room in the
Faculty Club, and we reminisced about the same things you and I are talking
about. We also saluted people whom we have lost, and one of the sobering
things about the day was we raised our glasses to individuals [who were part
of Feminist Studies/CROW] to whom we had all been close, and there were
at least as many of them as there were people around the table, which is a
sad fact.
[01:40:41] People who were most crucial, perhaps most crucial of all
after Myra Strober and Estelle Freedman, were Shelly Rosaldo and Diane
Middlebrook. They were brilliant scholars in their own fields and

75

charismatic individuals and real leaders, and these were the intellectual fire
brands that inspired all the rest of us and really brought the movement
together.
The year I accepted the presidency of Wellesley, Shelly Rosaldo fell
to her death. She was an anthropologist working somewhere in the South
Pacific, and she fell to her death on a walk, on a research trip, and that was
just a totally devastating blow. Then, you know, not too many years after I
left, Diane Middlebrook died of cancer.
[01:41:55] So those people were really close to me when I was here,
and I miss them tremendously. Myra was the strategist [who figured out
how to get things done], the economist who gave data for everything.
Estelle was a very fine young historian who was a mover and a shaker in her
own way. She’s been deeply involved in this project. But the charismatic
leaders to me were Shelly and Diane, and to have lost both of them so
young was just devastating.
Anderson: Did you all spend a lot of time together just relaxing and hanging out
outside of your work?
Keohane: No, not much.
Anderson: It was mostly work-focused?
Keohane: We would combine them. I mean, we would spend a whole day on Saturday
at somebody’s house doing work and then breaking for lunch and having
fun and talking and gossiping and then going back to work.
[01:43:02] And we went on a daylong retreat up at Diane
Middlebrook’s. She married Carl Djerassi, who had a lot of money and had

76

a big estate up in the foothills, and we went to that ranch for a Saturday and
we went swimming and we sat out in the sun and talked. Yes, we did that
occasionally, but most of our friendships were with our work.
Anderson: And who else did you spend time with when you were here for your social
life and what did that look like?
Keohane: Well, we were close to the people in our book group. David Kennedy,
Martin Evans, Amos Tversky, [Lee Yearley, John McFarquhar as well as my
husband]. I was the only woman. Not because other wives weren’t invited;
they just didn’t want to come. We read books that each of us would take
turns choosing and talk about it, and it was a marvelous experience. And I
got to know those people very well. Amos, of course, also tragically died,
you know, before he would have won his Nobel Prize, which went to his
colleague Danny Kahneman. And Martin Evans also died not too long ago.
We’ve remained close to David; we saw him and his new wife shortly after
we got here, and we’ve seen them several times.
So yes, some of the friendships were with the book group, some were
through the Western Culture planning group, and many of them were with
folks who were related to us through our kids doing sports. Bob coached
Little League. We had good friends who would come out to the Center for
Advanced Study every year from places we knew. So we had a lot of friends
from many different backgrounds, but my closest relationships were with
the Feminist Studies group.
Anderson: And this same group was also involved with editing Signs, right?

77

Keohane: [01:45:00] Signs, yes. And that was a great experience; we really had to be
interdisciplinary because there was only a small number of us. Papers came
in to be considered from every possible discipline, and we had to decide
whether they were worth even sending out to a reviewer. So we had to read
them as thoughtfully as we could and learn. I learned an enormous amount
from being a co-editor of Signs about every aspect of what could be
considered women’s or feminist studies.
It took a lot of time to edit a journal. Barbara Gelpi was the main
editor, but we were all with her as co-editors, and we all did it together. That
was a wonderful experience intellectually and also learning what it takes to
produce a journal. So that was part of the whole experience. First it was
CROW, which was established just before I came, then Feminist Studies
which we all established together, and then Signs, which we all edited.
Anderson: I wanted to circle back to give you a chance to talk a little bit more about
what you alluded to earlier with balancing kids with career. Is there anything
else you wanted to mention there?
Keohane: [01:46:10] Well we took turns with the responsibilities for things like picking
Nat up and bringing him home, but the older boys at that point, were in the
middle of their elementary school years, and they were at Nixon School,
which is not very far away. They would walk to school or ride their bikes to
school by themselves, and they would play on the school grounds afterward.
It was very different from today when everybody has soccer or ballet or
piano or hockey and the parents need to drive them and pick them up.
Their afternoons were spent with their friends playing on the schoolyard,

78

and there would be some adults around, but that’s what they did. Then they
would come home and one of us would be there and they would start on
their homework or whatever.
[01:46:55] So there was much less demanding super-parenting than
there is now, and I sometimes wonder now how people do it. Because for
us--particularly in this climate and with our offices, the daycare center, and
the school so close to our homes, and with the kids being very healthy,
which was lucky, and our having two jobs in the same place, which is
tremendously fortunate--we were able to do the parenting and have it be a
crucial part of our lives without having it dominate by having to drive them
around everywhere. It just wasn’t the way it worked. So it was a less
demanding job. I mean, being a parent is always demanding. We had to do
all the things parents do with discipline and learning how to deal with
scrapes and so forth, but we took an equal share of it and an equal share of
the housework, and that made all the difference.
Anderson: Did you guys take turns cooking dinner?
Keohane: Actually, it’s funny. I thought I was supposed to be the cook. My mother
had been a great cook, and I thought I was supposed to know how to cook.
I was okay with ordinary meals but giving a dinner party would cause me to
go into a tizzy.
[01:48:03] So we didn’t do enough of that. Only belatedly when we
were out here at the Center again from 1987 to 1988 did Bob decide he
would like to do the cooking, and he turned out to be a great natural cook. I
was quite happy to sit and do some work or have a glass of wine or

79

whatever as he cooked and talk to him and then clean up afterward. It was a
great division of labor. If we’d found that earlier, our lives would have been
much better, but I thought somehow I was supposed to cook. I’m a pretty
good cook, and he would cook sometimes, but not often.
I remember when I first visited him at his bachelor apartment in
Washington after he’d gotten divorced and looked in his refrigerator. There
was a ham, a cucumber, and some ice cream, and that was it. I thought, ha!
[laughs] So he wasn’t a natural cook. He didn’t think about how he was
going to make himself a gourmet dinner. But apart from that, I did most of
the cooking, I did the laundry, but he did a lot of the house cleaning and the
driving the kids to appointments and did all the finances and kept the
accounts and took care of the car and so we really had a pretty equal
division.
Anderson: [01:49:11] What was your favorite thing to cook when you were the one
doing it?
Keohane: Baking. Always baking. I didn’t particularly like just cooking, but I loved
making cakes and pies and bread. Didn’t do it as often as I would have
liked, but I enjoyed baking because that meant you could sort of put it in
and smell it and watch the cookies rise or whatever. It’s funny, I really loved
and I still do enjoy baking, but that was not the same as preparing dinner.
Anderson: Do you bake today for your colleagues and stuff?
Keohane: I do in the summer. No, not for colleagues. No, I never do it for anybody
else, but in the summer in Maine, when I have a lot more time, I’m not
trying to write a paper or give a lecture or whatever, I bake with my

80

granddaughters. Bob makes blueberry pancakes, and we’ll make cookies or
brownies or pies. So yes, in the relaxation of the summer in Maine, it’s been
an important part of life.
Anderson: [01:50:09] Before we stop for today, I just want to ask you if there’s
anything just on the topics that we’ve already talked about that you feel like
you didn’t get a chance to say or anything else.
Keohane: Well, my brother and my sister, but we’ll come back to that, maybe.
Anderson: If you want to talk about them now--.
Keohane:

My sister Geneva is seven and a half years younger than I am, so we
weren’t that close growing up; we were just too different in age. However,
we have become very close as we have been adults. She’s probably now my
closest friend, and our having shared a family background makes that even
more important and even more rewarding. I was not that close to my sister
growing up, but we planted the seeds of a really strong lifelong friendship.
[01:50:58] My brother Arthur was closer in age and we did things
together, like he taught me how to shoot a BB gun at a beer can on a rock,
and he rode a motorcycle, and he had a friend who had a motorcycle who
sometimes took me for a ride. We did some things like that together, but he
had a different set of friends, and so it wasn’t as though we were terrifically
close. Again, we’ve become closer since. He has also become a professor
and an associate dean at Vanderbilt, and we share university administration
interest. So although we weren’t inseparable friends growing up, the seeds
were planted of a very close set of lifelong friendships, which have been
important to me as a grown-up.

81

Anderson: What is your sister up to today?
Keohane: My sister Geneva Overholser was a freelance journalist with a husband who
was teaching at the American School in Kinshasa. Before she got married,
she had been a journalist at the Colorado Springs Sun, and then they went to
Africa and she wrote freelance for the New York Times while he was there.
Then in Paris, she did the same, and then she became a reporter and deputy
editor for the New York Times when she got back.
[01:52:13] Then she was the editor of the Des Moines Register, won a
Pulitzer Prize there. She [was divorced and remarried to a fine journalist
colleague, David Westphal, and she] went back to be a member of the
editorial staff at the New York Times, and then she was a columnist for the
Washington Post for a while. She became dean of the School of Journalism at
the University of Southern California for five years, [and then returned to
New York]. She’s on some boards, she does a lot of writing. She’s had a
very distinguished career as a journalist. I mean, lots of people know her
name.
Anderson: And what did your brother do on his way to becoming the-Keohane: [01:52:53] He was a professor at Vanderbilt in chemical engineering from
the start and has stayed there, risen through the ranks, and become an
associate dean, so that has been his life. [He is married to Susan, a
wonderful woman, and they have three daughters].

PART:

2 OF 2

Anderson: My name is Benjamin Anderson. Today is May 18, 2018. I am joined by
Professor Nan Keohane to conduct our second interview session for the
Stanford Faculty Oral History Project and the Pioneering Women Project,
which are carried out by the Stanford Historical Society.
So when we left off, we were getting ready to talk about your
teaching. We just finished talking about your involvement with CROW and
the Feminist Studies Program. Now can you tell me a little bit about the
teaching components of your work while you were here at Stanford?
Keohane:

[00:00:35] I have always very much enjoyed teaching. I did it first at
Swarthmore, which is a very demanding place to teach, brilliant students
who expect great professors to share knowledge with them. I learned from
that experience, and when I came to Stanford, therefore, I had had some
very relevant background--which many new professors don’t have. I found
it particularly rewarding to teach Stanford undergraduates. The Political
Science Department, as I think we discussed, had very little focus on

83

political philosophy so there were almost no graduate students. And the
graduate students who came had already planned to work with my senior
colleagues. I was able to be on a couple of committees, but I didn’t advise
any graduate students in the way that I could say, “All right, this is ‘my
student,’” the way many of my colleagues did. However, that never
bothered me very much because I really enjoyed teaching Stanford
undergraduates.
[00:01:44] I also taught members of the Knight journalism program,
mid-career fellows, who were very, very interesting students with their own
backgrounds. They were often high-ranking reporters or editors at major
newspapers in the US and they chose my course, I think particularly
European Roots in American Democratic Thought, because it seemed very
relevant to them, providing both historical background and a focus on
important contemporary issues. I enjoyed teaching those PJFs, professional
journalism fellows, very much but that was just one component.
I liked both big lecture courses and also seminar courses, and I found
Stanford a very supportive place to teach. I was honored to receive the
Gores Award for excellence in teaching, one of the most important things
that has ever happened as far as I’m concerned because I know how many
fine teachers there are at Stanford. That was some attestation that it was
going well. [00:02:56] The more important thing was, I think, the students
were always very receptive, tended to come, tended to say they were
enjoying it, and if they weren’t they would tell me why and ask great

84

questions either way. So yes, teaching at Stanford was a very rewarding part
of my life.
Anderson: Would you say there are any differences you noted between teaching at
Swarthmore and teaching at Stanford, since it was so formative at
Swarthmore? What changed??
Keohane:

[00:03:21] It’s hard for me to tell you that this many decades later. I don’t
remember serious differences. I do remember that at Swarthmore I was
expected to teach comparative politics, my second field in graduate school,
which meant I learned a lot there. But I didn’t have to do that at Stanford.
All of my courses and seminars were in political philosophy, and I also had
more leeway to make choices about what I wanted to teach. At Swarthmore
you basically had a set of courses and you get assigned your part of them. At
Stanford, in addition to teaching the basic political theory introductory
survey, Plato to wherever, I also taught a number of courses that I designed
including the course called European Roots of American Democratic
Thought that was quite popular. Also a course late in my time, a seminar in
feminist theory, but that was very late.
[00:04:15] There were other courses that I designed or seminars that I
developed, but the main thing was I had the opportunity to shape courses. I
also taught in the Western Culture program, which I had helped design, and
that in itself was a fascinating experience because we all had to put on the
table what students at Stanford really ought to learn, and we all had a
somewhat different set of ideas after Plato and the Bible and Shakespeare.
As I mentioned one of my main joys was being able to persuade people that

85

we should have at least one woman on the list, which sounds pretty minor
but it was nonetheless a victory. So I taught in the Western Culture course
spring quarter, which meant that I taught mostly nineteenth-century
literature and philosophy. I remember when we got to the week on Marx I
thought--because I was teaching at that point a whole seminar on Marx and
Hegel--I thought, “How on earth am I going to teach Marx in half a week
when I’m spending almost a whole semester on him?” But then we got to
Keats--I’m a great admirer of his poetry but I know nothing about Keats-and so I thought, “How am I going to have a whole class on Keats?”
[laughter] So that was a very different feeling.
Anderson: [00:05:42] What did you like so much about teaching?
Keohane:

Well, what’s not to like? Grading--I didn’t like grading. I never liked grading.
I liked giving students thoughtful assessments of their work, and I’ve always
been commended for writing a page or two on somebody’s essay, which I
thought was just pretty standard. A student puts in the time and energy to
write a twelve- to fifteen- to twenty-page essay; you ought to at least give
them the benefit of some carefully worked-out comments. I would usually
give quite lengthy comments and people were always extremely grateful, and
I didn’t realize for a while that it was because lots of other people would
send a few sentences back. I found the writing of the comments--working
through what I thought was good about it and where it could be improved
and why--a very useful mental exercise to me and to the student, so that’s
one thing I enjoyed.

86

[00:06:48] I guess because I’m inherently an actress I really enjoyed
the big lectures most. To me it would be hard to be in a world where
everything is done online and the professor is mainly supposed to lead
discussions after somebody else gives a lecture. I would find that very hard.
I like lecturing, and I always found it important to connect with the
students. I could always tell when things were working well and when they
weren’t, when the students would sort of shift restlessly or check their
newspapers--now it would be their iPhones. I could always tell. People don’t
realize how much you can tell from the front of a room about what’s going
on if you’re an attentive teacher. So it was always very rewarding when
people were really connected.
[00:07:22] I also found that even in the largest courses--I never taught
a course larger than about 180 people, which was much bigger than I’d ever
done at Swarthmore, and it wasn’t that big as a course at Stanford. But I
thought even in a course of 120 or 130 people, or eighty which was fairly
standard for me, I always encouraged people to ask questions and tried to
make some time for discussion. I found it helpful to have TAs and have
discussion sections, and I usually tried to lead one myself so I’d get a sense
of how people were reacting to the material. But what I liked best was the
lecturing and conveying ideas in a dramatic and effective way.
[00:08:20] I also enjoyed seminars. But some people are best at
leading seminars, and I found it rewarding and always valuable to engage in
that kind of interchange. What I liked best was lectures.

87

Anderson: You said some of your classes you got to build from the ground up and
make them whatever you wanted to be. Can you say a little bit about how
you went about building a class like that?
Keohane:

[00:08:50] Well, my main responsibility and the main reason I was in the
department and my main duty was to teach the history of political thought.
So my courses tended to be some variant of that. But with the course I’ve
mentioned a couple of times, the European Roots of American Democratic
Thought, it was built as part of the new international relations program,
which was humanities as well as social science oriented. Mine was a
humanities-type course in that program, and I was teaching it therefore to
students who would be taking other courses on international relations,
international organization, war and peace. I tried to construct it with that in
mind, but to show them that many American ideas that we take for granted
as being very native to the US actually were brought to us across the
Atlantic, and we owe much to Locke and Montesquieu. I was attempting to
show those connections, and I found it very rewarding to decide, “So which
European thinkers need to be included here if you’re going to show how
American thought developed?” Which meant I didn’t teach Hobbes, who
has not been very influential in the US even though he’s a crucial figure in
the development of political thought more generally. And I didn’t teach
Marx at any length in that course. [The point was]: “All right, these are our
American ideas in political thought and here are some of the major sources
in European thought that we should understand to see how this
transatlantic journey has worked.”

88

Anderson: [00:10:38] Were there other faculty members who you looked up to as a
teacher while you were at Stanford?
Keohane:

There were certainly faculty members I looked up to at Swarthmore because
I was much more junior, and we were closer to our senior faculty colleagues.

Anderson: You can tell me about them.
Keohane:

Well, it was, you know, J. Roland Pennock who is a legend as a history of
political thought professor, and I sat in on some of his lectures and I learned
a lot from him. At Stanford there were certainly colleagues I liked and
learned from, but we didn’t tend to sit in on each other’s courses. And so I
would see people mostly in the context of their research or their family life,
not their teaching.

Anderson: Do you have any particular students that you remember from when you
were teaching, or did anything interesting happen that stuck with you?
Keohane:

[00:11:36] There were a lot of wonderful students I taught at Stanford, but
I’m very bad at remembering specifics on a question like that. So maybe you
could just not ask it. [laughs]

Anderson: What about things you hoped your students took away from your courses?
Keohane:

I certainly hope they took away a critical perspective in the best sense of the
word, not trying to immediately knock something down but to think about
what can I learn from this? How do I try to understand why the person who
wrote this book did so? What was he or she trying to convey? And how do I
respond in a way that is both true to what I need to know in the twentieth
century and what this person thought was important to share? So “critical”
in the sense of thinking deeply about a book, not just reading it and not just

89

thinking about the biography of the person who wrote it, but instead
thinking about the context of the times, the sort of Quentin Skinner
approach, what people were writing against that background. [00:12:41] For
example, I always enjoyed teaching Machiavelli and thinking about Florence
in the Renaissance, and trying to give people a sense of what that meant. So
context and criticism in the best sense of the word, not tearing things down,
were things I hoped people would learn.
Anderson: Did you ever feel as though your gender played a role in how your students
reacted to you as a professor or did it all just feel very normal?
Keohane:

I told you about the moment at Yale when the students came and knocked
on the door and said, “Oh, it’s a girl.”

Anderson: I don’t know if you did.
Keohane:

[00:13:17] Okay, well, it’s interestingly the only time I can remember. I’ve
probably suppressed things that were unpleasant at the time, but I certainly
didn’t often experience any gendered reactions to my teaching as far as I can
tell, except in two directions. First at Yale, where I was [a grader, not a
teaching assistant, which was not common then at Yale]; all we did was
grade [exams given in] other people’s courses, when we hadn’t even sat in
on their lectures. As a “grader,” I was just presented with exams by students
I had never met. It was a very bad system. You had to have office hours so
the students can come in and complain [about their grades]. I remember
sitting in the basement of Sterling Library in a room that had a kind of
translucent window in the door so you could see through partly. And as the
students--who of course were all men because there were no women

90

undergraduates at Yale at that point--as the students lined up outside I heard
one of them say, “Oh, no, it’s a girl!” That’s great for your self-confidence
when it’s the first time you’ve ever tried to have the authority of a teacher.
[00:14:25] But I don’t remember any other gendered reactions
negatively to my teaching at Swarthmore or Stanford. I do remember
positive reactions by women who would say, “Gosh, it’s great to have a
woman professor.” I find that very inspiring. And I also remember positive
reactions in my feminist theory seminar at the end where people thought it’s
really great to be taking this course together. But apart from that I don’t
recall negative reactions.
Anderson: I wanted to ask about that feminist political theory course because, as I
understand it, it was only kind of later in your teaching at Stanford that you
began to teach classes that had a feminist bent.
Keohane:

[00:15:12] I’d have to go back and look and see how much I actually did. I
know I had done something because when I got to Wellesley I taught a
feminist theory seminar in my living room and I didn’t start from scratch.
But I can’t remember exactly when and how long I taught feminist theory at
Stanford, and I do remember it was very much toward the end.

Anderson: Can you recall what was behind the shift or what made you realize that you
wanted to or should be teaching feminist political theory?
Keohane:

[00:15:44] Well, we talked last time about all the ways in which it had
affected my life and my thinking, and I more and more thought it was
important to share that with students. And also as I learned more about
feminist theory I realized how rich it really was, people like Simone de

91

Beauvoir and Virginia Woolf and others who were more contemporary. But
they were the ones that I kept coming back to and I wanted students to
have the opportunity to see how rich and stimulating those books were in a
feminist context. So that was the major motivation.
Anderson: I wanted to understand what makes feminist political theory feminist, and
how you set the topics and readings to reflect that perspective.
Keohane:

[00:16:33] Well, for one thing, as Susan Moller Okin showed in a book that
was published about the time I was finishing at Stanford, there were no
women in the major works of Western political thought in the sense of
women being taken seriously as citizens, as participants in the political
realm. So having taught that material all my life I had to step back and say,
“Wait a minute; I’ve been teaching these things that are all about men.” So
what happens if you start thinking about the role of women, as Susan did?
For me it was even more fruitful to say, “Okay, more recently there have
been some strong social theorists, particularly Beauvoir and Woolf in my
view, who have talked about the world from the perspective of a woman
and what that means.” To share those ideas particularly with other women
but also with men I found very rewarding. But I had not had the
background or the motivation to do it until I began reading their work.

Anderson: What were the reactions of your students and your colleagues to your
decision to teach this kind of class?
Keohane:

[00:17:49] Well, again most of my colleagues that I paid most attention to
were in Feminist Studies and they thought it was a great idea. In fact it was a
building block of the Feminist Studies major as I recall, or at least it was

92

very helpful. So those colleagues were very excited about it. Once again, my
colleagues in Political Science were fine. It didn’t matter that much to them.
Some were curious about it. Some would push back and say, “How on earth
can you have a whole course about women?” I didn’t have any trouble
answering that question. But they weren’t opposed; they were just curious. It
was a new idea.
Anderson: And the students, you said, were really excited that this option existed.
Keohane:

Yes, very much so. Yes.

Anderson: Is there anything else that you want to talk about with teaching, stories that
you remember, or things like that before we move on to research?
Keohane:

[00:18:45] I remember thinking it was very important to be able to balance
my teaching and research because I knew well that research is a major driver
if not the major driver of tenure at Stanford. And therefore even though my
impulse was often to spend one more hour getting ready for a course in
which I had given a lecture before and really didn’t need to give it one more
hour, I had to learn to cut back when it was time and say, “I’ve done plenty
of work on this. It’s going to go well. Now I need to turn to something
else.” The teaching and the research for me were interwoven in the sense
that I learned a lot from my courses about some ideas in political theory that
became valuable later on. I didn’t teach French political theory in the
seventeenth century so I never got them directly for my book, but since the
book is about authority and obedience and political inquiry, I got interesting
questions from students about issues like that. Always for me teaching was a
stimulus for my research. But I realized that I had to spend increasing

93

amounts of time on the book, and we can turn to that next. I also found the
research very rewarding.
Anderson: [00:20:10] So can you tell me a little bit about what your research focus was
when you were at Swarthmore and then how that evolved as you came to
Stanford?
Keohane:

[00:20:20] When I was at Swarthmore my research was primarily based on a
couple of theoretical issues: the notion of the common good, political
obligation to the common good. But I was also writing pieces on aspects of
French political theory I was learning more about as I was beginning to
think about expanding my dissertation. I wrote a couple of essays on
Montesquieu, I was asked to do something on “toleration” for a collection, I
did that, also something on the concept of progress. It was a broad set but
increasingly I was focusing more on what it would take to move from my
Marquis d’Argenson dissertation to a book that I would want to write on
French political thought. It was both types of things at Swarthmore.
[00:21:25] When I got here I continued that for a while but then, as I
said, I realized that if I was going to have a chance for tenure at Stanford I
really needed to buckle down and get the book written. As I mentioned, we
had a sabbatical at Harvard in 1972, and I did a great deal of work at
Widener Library. We also went to Paris in the summer before to do archival
work. So by the time I got to Stanford I had an awful lot of archival
material--which was great, because the Stanford library doesn’t have very
much seventeenth-century French stuff. I mean, it’s okay, but it’s not an
archival source. So I began to really think about what questions I would ask.

94

How far back would I push this inquiry? I kept pushing it further and
further back into the sixteenth century until I finally stopped with
Montaigne and said, “Now you’ve got to stop or you’ll be all the way back
to Plato before you know it,” and then thought about how I would move
forward from that until the pre-revolutionary era. So I sort of
conceptualized a book over time from Montaigne to Rousseau but with by
far the most serious focus being on the seventeenth century as a sort of
fulcrum in between the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.
[00:22:43] I envisioned the book. I began to write it. I worked hard
on it whenever I had time. The sabbatical at the Center for Advanced Study
in 1978-79 allowed me to pull the last version together. The timing was very
lucky on that. The book was published in 1980, but I got tenure on the basis
of the manuscript [which had been accepted for publication]. It was a
significant challenge, as anybody who’s ever tried to do it will tell you, to
write a book, teach three courses, and be part of a partnership that’s raising
a family. It’s not easy, and they were intense years but also very rewarding
ones.
I found research fascinating. I love asking questions--I mean, now
I’m more interested in doing research on concepts like leadership. But at
that time it was almost like as a scientist I was trying to discover a missing
link, because I had read so deeply in seventeenth-century French thought
There were all these treatises published in the first four decades of the
century that had to do with religious themes circling around the concept of
self-love, which is very much derived from Augustine and goes way back.

95

The idea of “self-love” was beginning to be more and more related to what
would become self-interest and more and more secular sounding. Yet it was
still very religious, and I [consulted quite a few] manuscripts and a few
published books up through 1640. I also worked on some works from the
1660s in which the concept of self-love had become very secularized and
was very much what we would now consider self-interest--as Adam Smith
would pick it up.
[00:24:50] I knew there had to be something done in the 1650s that
helped bridge that gap, but there weren’t any manuscripts that I’d ever seen
and certainly no published books that would talk about self-interest in a way
that would show you how you move from theology to everyday life. So one
of the things that was most exciting was finding one in a relatively obscure
library in France--I can’t even remember which small provincial city--this
manuscript that did exactly what I knew had to be done, which had actually
been quite widely known at the time but had become pretty obscure. And it
was like, “Eureka!” I mean, I had found this wonderful linkage and it’s a
very exhilarating feeling, doing really serious, really deep research.
Anderson: That is really cool.
Keohane:

[00:25:40] Thank you. And writing, too--I loved writing. I found writing
very challenging--as I’m sure you do. It’s rewarding to hone the craft, get
words to work better together and produce an essay or a document, a
lecture, a book where the words really do the job clearly and elegantly
without a lot of extra verbiage but get the point across. I found that

96

developing that craft and writing a book a very rewarding process as well, in
addition to the research.
Anderson: This project grew out of your dissertation that you wrote, right?
Keohane:

[00:26:22] Yes, although the dissertation topic, the Marquis d’Argenson--in
the end I wrote a book that has eighteen chapters, and the Marquis
d’Argenson was half of one chapter. But he was there and his inspiration
sort of grew out in both directions.

Anderson: So that is how you initially got interested in-Keohane:

In that period, yes.

Anderson: Can you remind me how you got interested in him to begin with? You
started with Rousseau, right?
Keohane:

[00:26:56] I started sort of with Rousseau but very broadly, and so many
people were writing about Rousseau. I really didn’t have a great idea for a
thesis. As I mentioned, I was going to work on Benjamin Constant, the
liberal theorist in the early nineteenth century, but then when I discovered
that somebody at Brown was about to come out with a book on him. Since
my advisors with Yale weren’t that focused on what I was doing, they didn’t
say, “Oh, forget about it. Don’t worry; your dissertation will be fine even if
he’s publishing his book,” so I figured it wouldn’t be a good idea to write on
Constant because somebody else was already doing it. Bad decision but in
retrospect I’m glad I made it because even though Constant is a great topic I
would never have gotten back into seventeenth-century France.

97

Anderson: So you’ve talked a bit about your research process, but I wanted to know if
there’s anything else you wanted to share about how you went about it and
what you did when you got stuck and didn’t know what to do next.
Keohane:

[00:27:58] That’s more the writing than the research. The research--I tended
to have these great leads and I tended to write a lot of notes--it was, of
course, before computers--and keep them and sort them through and
develop a sort of process for doing it. I can’t remember exactly all the
techniques I used, but I found the research--you know, one lead would take
me somewhere else. The writing--I sometimes found it hard to know exactly
where I was going next and which parts of a complicated enterprise were
going to be worthy to sustain and move forward with. But I also enjoyed it.
It was a good challenge.

Anderson: And when you finished that book or in general when you finished a paper,
how did you decide what to write the next thing about?
Keohane:

[00:28:51] Well, first of all, you felt very exhilarated. Finishing a big book, as
I’ve always said, is right up there with your first child as a huge event in your
life. They’re comparable. They’re exhilarating. You’ve sort of labored for a
long time and borne this thing, and now here it is! And here’s this beautiful
baby and here’s this beautiful book. That was the way I felt when I finished,
and I savored that for a while. But you have to remember that that was right
before I became chair of the Faculty Senate, which took a lot of time and
thought, got deeply into feminist studies and felt I really wanted to shift
gears and work on feminist topics, and was just beginning to think about
what that would mean. And yet at the same time I wanted to go on further

98

in the eighteenth century and write something about Rousseau. I felt I was
now much better prepared. That’s one reason it was really hard to decide to
leave and go to be an administrator. I mean, there are much more
fundamental concerns: moving my family, giving up Stanford, having no
idea what it would be like to be an administrator. But one reason [for
hesitation is that] I wanted to write a book on pre-revolutionary French
thought with a focus on Rousseau, and it felt sad to abandon it because I
thought, “It’s unlikely I’ll ever get back to it,” and in fact I haven’t.
Anderson: I was also wondering about this feminist turn you talked about, because we
talked about before how you kind of realized women were missing right in
time for you to write the preface to your book and dedicate it to your mom.
I was wondering how your work looked after this, and how it changed.
Keohane:

[00:30:51] Well, it certainly seemed weird to have written this book like it
seemed weird to have taught all these courses that were all in effect about
men. But I didn’t have as much time to think through what that meant or
think about where I would go with feminist thought as I would have ideally,
because before I knew it I was having to switch to think about
administration, which was a totally different topic.

Anderson: Your first book was about France and political philosophy, and then both of
the books you published later were about education and leadership. So I just
kind of wanted to hear-Keohane:

[00:31:31] Well, no, Thinking About Leadership is nothing about education.

Anderson: Oh, okay.
Keohane:

It’s all about leadership.

99

Anderson: One about education and one about leadership, then.
Keohane:

That’s right. And I also coedited the issue of Signs on feminist theory which
was published as a book by University of Chicago Press. So my second
book was actually about feminist theory, but it was co-edited [with Barbara
Gelpi].

Anderson: So is the reason your focus changed because what you were doing changed,
and the reason you wrote about those other topics is because you were in
administration? Or are there other reasons why you changed so much what
you were working on?
Keohane:

[00:32:04] Well, when you spend twenty-three years of your life as a college
president you don’t have much time to think about research. And I knew I
wouldn’t be able to go back to eighteenth-century France because far too
much had been written and thought about it since I left off. And also--I may
have mentioned this--when I decided to accept the Wellesley job in the end,
one reason I did it was because I was curious about power, as a political
scientist. We all write about power. But what does it really mean, to have
power? What does it feel like? What does it mean? I had always said, “If I
take this job, when I finish I’m going to write a book about leadership.” So I
knew from the beginning that that book was going to be written not about
leadership in higher education but about what does it feel like to have
power? What do you do with it? How do you measure success? So [I had
been thinking about that book for] a long time.

Anderson: We were just talking about your research and one of the questions we
wanted to come back to was--you said a lot had been written about French

100

political thought in that time period. I wanted to hear from you about how
you saw your work contributing to or engaging in that larger body of work.
Keohane:

[00:33:28] Actually I didn’t mean to say that because there hadn’t been a lot
of work about French seventeenth-century political thought. There was a lot
of work about the eighteenth century, people like Rousseau and
Montesquieu but not about the seventeenth century. And that’s why I
thought Philosophy and the State in France would be a major significant
contribution and I think it has been. A lot of people have used it,
generations of students and teachers. So I didn’t write it because there was a
lacuna, but I did find it fascinating that there was so little written about
seventeenth-century French political theory when there was a lot written
about the thinkers themselves: Pascal, Descartes--huge amounts about
them, but not about the political [theory of the period]. Each of these
thinkers wrote some things that have some political implications. But there
were also other less-well-known thinkers that I wanted to write about who
contributed to the development of political thought in Europe in ways that
were very important and powerful. I was trying to piece that together and
found that there had not been a lot written about seventeenth-century
French political thought.

Anderson: So you started researching this because you were interested in it, and then it
so happened that this was an area that really just had not been well-tread
before.
Keohane:

[00:34:44] Yes, that’s exactly right. And the reason I was interested in it,
although, as is often the case, I didn’t really formulate this puzzle until I was

101

some distance through it, but what I was really interested in--why do these
very revolutionary thinkers like Pascal or Descartes who made fundamental,
radical changes in the way we think about science, about theology, about
math, about philosophy--they had really radical and very powerful ideas that
were new and influential. Why didn’t they also rebel in politics? Why did
they meekly obey an “absolute monarch” when they were doing such
radically groundbreaking changes in other areas? And I think the answer,
which is pretty obvious when you think about it but you have to put it all
together, is because they were most of all concerned about civil war the
same way Hobbes was. He actually wrote Leviathan in France at the same
time many of these people were working. And their fear, their concern was,
having lived through the wars of religion and the Fronde--which was a
horrible period for France --they had lived through it. They saw the horrors
of civil war and they wanted to avoid that above all things because it made it
impossible for them to do their work, to have to be worried all the time
about having soldiers come and kill your family. So the thing they feared
most was civil war, and they therefore were willing to obey an absolute
monarch--with quotes, “absolute monarch,” because nobody’s really
absolute but a monarch who called himself absolute, Louis XIV, in order to
avoid civil war.
Anderson: So their other projects were very important to them.
Keohane:

Very important to them and to the world, yes--their philosophy, their
theology, their mathematics, their science. But they didn’t rock the boat
politically, unlike the English who lived through civil wars, and who reacted

102

partly by launching a political revolution and killing the king. It was a very
different reaction, and I was quite interested in why that was true. It was the
same period.
Anderson: What was it like for these people living under the monarch? How bad was
it?
Keohane:

[00:37:11] It wasn’t really that bad at all as far as you can tell. I mean, they
couldn’t write anything they might think about politics, but they could write
about science and even in some ways, in a veiled way, theology. I don’t have
the impression that it was an unpleasant place. They certainly didn’t have
surveillance in their lives all the time, which became more common later, in
the eighteenth century before the revolution. [As privileged members of
society], they were going on about their business. And as you can see this
really is more intellectual history than it is original political thought. It’s the
history of political thought but also the history of a particular period and the
ways in which people thought about politics within it, not just great political
thinkers like Hobbes.

Anderson: So those people you talked about like Descartes and Pascal weren’t saying
anything about politics, but this is a book about political thought, so what
were people saying?
Keohane:

[00:38:04] There’s chapters on both. I mean, there’s a section on Descartes
and a whole chapter on Pascal. So they were talking--

Anderson: They were talking about it.
Keohane:

But this is not something that usually gets taught in the history of political
theory. There’s a good deal here about Montaigne. There is in fact also--

103

where do we come to Descartes? Descartes’s Provisional Morality, the
Philosopher in the City--two sections on Descartes of a chapter, and then a
whole chapter on Pascal, who was fascinating--in fact two chapters if you
look at his influence.
Anderson: So what did these people have to say about politics that we don’t hear about
today?
Keohane:

[00:38:47] Oh, well, I mean, how much time do we have? Pascal had things
to say about behavior and obedience which had clear political resonances.
One of the things he’s most famous for is his wager--you’re familiar with it?
That you have to make a bet. Either you believe in God or you don’t; you
can’t say macht nichts. I guess you could try, but he didn’t think it would
work. Either you believe that there’s God and an afterlife or you don’t
believe it, and if you believe it then your course is clear. You need to behave
in ways that show you are obedient to what God apparently has asked you
to do. That may not always be easy, but at least your course is set. But if you
don’t believe, then the question is are you willing to risk the chance that you
might be wrong, in fact there is a God and there is an afterlife and it
includes hellfire. That’s a pretty big risk, to be living in hellfire for eternity
when you think of something like Dante’s hell and the way he described it.
That’s a pretty big risk, so Pascal was saying, “That risk is big enough that
it’s worth believing in order to avoid it.” And you say, “But then of course
it’s very difficult just to decide to believe.”
[00:40:00] So what he said that had real relevance for politics is you
commit yourself to trying to believe, you pretend to believe, and then you

104

bend your knees but not your heart. But eventually, in religion at least, you
may come to believe [the religious doctrines] through the practices of
religion, which suggests a very interesting way to think about how political
practice might also cause you to develop certain views. Also he said
basically--I mean, I can’t remember whether he said this or other people
have said it since--but you can try to bend your knees, but not your spirit.
And so I think that’s the way they approached the absolute monarch. “Bend
my knees, bow before Louis XIV, but not internally cringe before him.”
Anderson: I wonder if you could say a little bit more about the impact and what
became of your book afterwards.
Keohane:

[00:41:13] Well, this is sort of sad because there was a whole panel at the
American Political Science Association on my book. But, by the time they
did it, I was already president of Wellesley. I was able to go to the
conference, but I didn’t really get a chance to talk to people about how they
were using the book, and I couldn’t really keep track down the line of how it
was being used. People would keep telling me, “Wow, I really liked your
book. I bought your book. It’s out of print. What are we going to do?”
Finally reprinted, so I knew people were using it and finding it valuable, but
I had already shifted gears and never had a chance to really realize how
much difference it was making.

Anderson: So you weren’t as involved with the aftermath of it as you would’ve liked to
be.
Keohane:

[00:41:58] Alas, alas--exactly, yes.

105

Anderson: Before we move past Stanford I just wanted to take a step back and look at
the holistic picture of your time here. One question I wanted to ask is how
do you feel Stanford changed while you were here, if at all?
Keohane:

[00:42:21] Well, it certainly changed for me and for those of us who were
involved in making a space for feminist thinking. But in terms of Stanford
more generally I don’t recall its changing dramatically nearly as much as it
has since. That wouldn’t have been the first thing I would’ve said, that
Stanford changed so much while I was here, but I was only here teaching
for eight years. That’s not a long time in the history of an institution.

Anderson: And you’ve been in a lot of universities. Is there anything you think that sets
Stanford apart from the other places that you’ve been either as a teacher or
as an administrator?
Keohane:

[00:43:03] Well, that’s hard to answer because I don’t know if you mean
when I was here or looking back.

Anderson: Either one is fine.
Keohane:

When I was here I thought of Stanford as being really refreshing and bold
and entrepreneurial and sort of the Stanford band spirit compared to the
older universities I’d attended--Yale, Oxford. It seemed to be sort of
insouciant and ready to take things a new direction. I still feel that way about
Stanford. I think that’s the way it is often now regarded, but it felt that way
at the time. And we particularly loved living in this area--but the university
felt sort of refreshed and novel and pioneering in some ways compared to
Yale or Oxford at the time I joined it and in retrospect and today.

106

Anderson: Do you remember any kind of places on campus that you liked to go or that
were special to you? I know you like to hike and things like that.
Keohane:

[00:44:09] I always have really admired the main quad. I think it’s a beautiful
piece of architecture and I would enjoy the fact that my office was on the
quad, at the back of the History Corner. I could look out over the parts of
the quad. I liked that. I also found it pleasant to ride my bike all around
from our house on Salvatierra Street all the way wherever I needed to go on
campus. But from the point of view of places to retreat to, it was more likely
to be the ocean or the mountains.

Anderson: I also wanted to ask what some of the biggest challenges were that you
faced during your time here.
Keohane:

[00:44:56] Oh, well, finishing the book, getting tenure.

Anderson: And finally, I just wanted to see if you had any more memories or stories to
share about your time at Stanford before we move on.
Keohane:

It’s hard now to unravel the layers because we were back in 1987-1988 at
the Center for Advanced Study. We were back again in 2004-2005, and here
we are again. I’m sort of having to unravel back to think what it was like in
1980 compared to later. But I think [that “layering” of experience over the
years is] in itself a very rich part of my life because there are so many things
that remain the same, at least until this time when they gutted the [periphery
of the Main Quad] and built all sorts of new things out there. Before this
time, Stanford was growing and developing, but with the new Engineering
Quad and the destruction of the undergraduate library and the building of
that open area between the Law School and Green [Library], Stanford

107

campus just feels different now in ways that it never had before. Before, the
growth was mostly in the hospital or in some science building that was
added but in an area that I never really went to, and the gym--you know,
Roble Gym was where we went the other two times we were here after
1980, and then all of a sudden there’s Arrillaga [Recreation Center].
[00:46:20] It just feels that between 2005 and 2018 there has been much
more rapid change than there had been between 1978-1979 and 1987-1988
or 1987-1988 even and 2004. So it just seems like it’s changed really a lot in
the last fifteen years.
Anderson: Do you like how it looks without the library there?
Keohane:

I’ve gotten used to it. At first it was, “Where is it?” Yes, I like the clock
tower. I know it’s not everybody’s favorite place, but I love listening to the
bells and the time. It reminds me of Oxford. So yes, I like the way the
campus looks now but it took me a little while to get used to it.

Anderson: It sounds like you sort of felt this enduring connection to Stanford because
you just keep coming back.
Keohane:

[00:47:07] I absolutely do. I gave a talk yesterday at the Academic Council
and the 50th anniversary of the Faculty Senate, and I basically said, as I
ended talking about the future of shared governance here, “As someone
who cares deeply about Stanford, I wish you all the best in this journey.”
And I meant it.

Anderson: Moving on to when you left Stanford, we can start by just talking about why
you decided that you wanted to leave Stanford and go serve in
administration.

108

Keohane:

I didn’t want to leave Stanford.

Anderson: Okay, that’s not what happened.
Keohane:

[00:47:45] That’s not the way the decision got made. [laughter] I left despite
not wanting to leave, very much not wanting to leave. I had been elected
chair of the Faculty Senate, which made me kind of a visible figure. Even
though it didn’t have a lot of authority, it was a visible post and it was a time
in 1979 when everybody was beginning to say, “Well, we need some women
on our list of potential candidates or we won’t be shown to have taken
women seriously.” So everybody was reaching out to women who had any
position of prominence to ask them if they would be willing to be
candidates for a deanship or a provostship or a presidency or whatever. And
I had an absolute easy response. I said, “No, thank you. I’m not interested.
Go away.” And I meant it. I had no interest in administration. I’d never run
anything. I’d never wanted to run anything. I was curious about politics, but
I never had any power or any intent to have power.
[00:48:46] But when my alma mater unexpectedly invited me to be
interviewed for the presidency, I thought, “They can’t be serious. I mean,
I’ve had no management experience. They can’t ask me to be a president,
but I will say yes to an interview, only because I want to tell them what I
think Wellesley is doing wrong these days.” Because a lot of [colleges and
universities] were going coed. Smith had gone coed, most of the Ivies had
gone coed and Wellesley was one of a group of woman’s colleges who held
out and said, “We’re not going coed.” But I had the impression that they did
so just sort of by default. “We don’t know what it’s like for a woman’s

109

college to go coed, but we do know we’re very good at women’s education
so let’s just stay the course for now.” And it was almost like, “Someday we’ll
probably do it.” No, that’s not fair. “Let’s stay the course for now.” But
there wasn’t any sense of excitement about it as far as I could see.
[00:49:45] So they sent out one trustee and one faculty member to
come to the West Coast and interview, I’m sure, several people. I told them
that I thought Wellesley was missing a real--I mean, I was speaking with my
full feminist fervor here. And Wellesley is historically a very feminist
institution. And so I said, “All right, I think we’re missing a big chance to
show what a women’s college can be like in the heyday of second-wave
feminism in the twentieth century.” And basically I thought, “Well, they’ll
say thank you and go away.” But they didn’t. They said, “We really agree
with you. Will you come back and be interviewed? You’re a serious
candidate.” And I thought, “Oh, no. [laughter] I didn’t expect that.” And if
I’d known that was what they were going to do, I probably never would
have agreed to be interviewed because I really had no ambition to be a
president. But once I’d done it, once I’d gotten into it, I couldn’t just say,
“Oh, well, I didn’t mean it.”
[00:50:44] So I went back to be interviewed and I found that--much
more than I realized--I had these wonderful, deep memories of Wellesley. I
hadn’t been in touch. I hadn’t gone back to any reunions or anything but
being back on campus--I’m a very place-oriented person, as you may have
gathered. Being back on campus in the November twilight with the chapel,
when I’d sung in the choir--I could hear the choir singing in the chapel and

110

the same choir director was still there. The only difference was his hair was
gray. Otherwise it seemed that Wellesley hadn’t changed a bit. And I just felt
deeply loyal to my alma mater.
[00:51:19] So in the end, long story short--the interview with the
board went well, and they basically said, “If you will commit to accepting,
we will offer you the job.” Well, before I went back for that campus
interview I had had a long period of time talking with my husband, with my
family, with my brother and sister, friends trying to think this through and
had finally decided that if they offered me the job I would take it. But it was
a very difficult decision because we loved Stanford. My family was very
happy. Bob was chairing the government department as well as this IR
[International Relations] program. We had no desire to move, but I left--I
decided to make that decision, with my family’s support, because, first, of
my strong feminist inclinations and the opportunity to do something about
it; secondly, my loyalty to Wellesley; and third, my curiosity about power. I
discovered I really wanted to know what it felt like to have power as a
political scientist. So those were the three reasons, but it was entirely a pull.
There was no push. I had no desire to leave Stanford, which I loved and
love.
Anderson: Can you say a little bit more about this idea you had going in about
Wellesley’s identity as a woman’s college and your vision for that? You
talked about what you didn’t like, but I want to hear what you thought it
should be like.

111

Keohane:

[00:52:45] It was mostly rhetorical and symbolic. It was mostly that the
language Wellesley was using to describe itself in an institution--which had
historically been very visibly feminist in the nineteenth century--was now
not being so. And I thought, “Well, at the very least I could come and make
speeches and talk to faculty and students and alums about the power of
Wellesley’s feminism in this day and age.” But frankly that was really all I
had thought about. I hadn’t thought about the curriculum, and I hadn’t
thought about what different faculty might be. And, in fact, that wasn’t as
much what I did in the end as the rhetorical focus, the symbolism, the
speaking out for Wellesley as a feminist institution, which inspired a lot of
people. But that’s all I really thought about.

Anderson: So your family followed you out there, right?
Keohane:

We went together. They didn’t follow me. We went together. [laughter]

Anderson: Was that transition difficult, and what did your husband do when you guys
moved?
Keohane:

[00:53:50] Bless his heart. Talk about a partnership. When he decided with
me that this was something he really wanted me to do and he, as I said, had
all these wonderful things going on at Stanford, he got offers of jobs at Yale
and at Columbia as a full professor. But they were both, of course, some
commuting distance from Wellesley, and we had two boys in high school
and a son in the fifth grade. He felt, wonderfully, that he couldn’t commute
because he knew I would be traveling a lot and we couldn’t have kids that
age at home by themselves. He was also offered a job at Brandeis which he
took, which turned out to be very rewarding for him. It was a great place to

112

teach. He wrote his greatest book there because there was a lot of time for
research. Nobody was asking him to do any administration. So in the end
we were very glad that we had done it, and after a few years Harvard, his
alma mater for his PhD, saw the light and invited him to teach at Harvard.
But he went to a less prestigious institution but a very rewarding one. He
wouldn’t have gone, nor would I have gone myself if he didn’t have a job-he would never have left and I wouldn’t have wanted him to do it.
[00:55:06] But the kids--I mean, it was fine for the boys. They had a
wonderful time. For our younger son, it was hard at first. He’d been so
socially involved at Stanford, at Lucille Nixon School as it then was, and was
a really lively kid. When Bob went to pick him up for a dentist appointment
during his first year in middle school at Wellesley and saw our socially lively,
vigorous son sitting by himself on the playground, Bob said, “We’re going
to put him somewhere else.” So he transferred to Milton, had a great
experience. But the first year was really hard for him. He loved Stanford,
probably more than any of the rest of us even, and whenever he comes
down here--he’s a senior vice-president of the Environmental Defense
Fund. He comes out to the Bay Area fairly often because there’s a California
office and he’s in charge of the climate change dimension, so he gets to
California for board meetings pretty often. Whenever he comes, he goes
and takes a run at Wunderlich Park or Tennessee Valley or tries to get to
Point Reyes, and he just loves it. So it was hard for him to leave, but it
worked out.

113

Anderson: For you, you said that once you were back on that campus it was almost like
a little bit magical. You remembered what it was like.
Keohane:

It was.

Anderson: And in what ways was Wellesley timeless in that way? And in what ways did
you feel like it was a different place than when you left?
Keohane:

[00:56:54] Well, the timelessness was mostly the physical place. I was very
honored to be promoted to full professor after I’d just been made associate
two years before. I said to Bob--I said [laughs], “Guess what? I’m a full
professor!” And Bob said, “Uh, aren’t you president?” [laughter] But being a
full professor really mattered to me. I assumed I would be taken seriously as
a faculty member. And it was sadly not true. I mean, people didn’t not take
me seriously. They knew I’d done really good scholarship and had tenure at
Stanford, but they saw me as president. I’d gone over to the dark side so to
speak. So I was never fully a member of the faculty at Wellesley, nor, I think
in retrospect, should I have expected that. But that was hard for me to get
used to. It was particularly complex because a number of the faculty
members had taught me. After all, I’d only graduated twenty years before.
So they thought it was a little weird for this Nan Overholser whom they’d
taught to come back as president.
[00:57:57] That was awkward, but it worked out. But that was the
biggest transition for me, no longer being taken seriously as a faculty
member. That’s not really true. The biggest transition was trying to learn
how to be a college president. That’s a whole different story. I knew nothing
about it. When I walked into the president’s office the first day, July 1, 1981,

114

I sat down at the venerable desk where my predecessor Margaret Clapp had
congratulated me on being a Marshall Scholar and consulted me about a
couple of things while I was a senior. I sat down behind that desk and I
thought, “I have no idea what a college president actually does.” I’d tried to
consult people out here before I left. I talked to the athletics director about
athletics. I’d talked to the finance people about finance. I read Machiavelli
again, which was not very helpful at all. [laughter] But I really had no idea
what college presidents did so I had to learn very quickly.
Anderson: What does a college president do? What did you do?
Keohane:

[00:58:55] Well, I learned, for example, that very soon a good executive
assistant would come in with a card--then it was a card; now it would be a
computer printout. But there was a card with all my appointments for the
day, and there were people I’d been scheduled to see. There were
committees I needed to attend. There were fundraising things I needed to
do. There were things that I needed to learn--I mean, you’re just sort of
thrown into it like learning to swim by being thrown into deep water. That
was the way it felt. College presidents do a great variety of things. People
have often said they’re like the mayor of a small city, and they are. You do
everything under the sun, and I had to learn how to do that.
[00:59:21] The toughest part for me was personnel, managing people,
since faculty members are not managed and I’d never managed anybody. So
I knew nothing about recruiting and evaluating vice-presidents, deans. That
was all new to me and I made some rookie mistakes. People were generous
and gave me some leeway, but it would’ve helped a lot to have some

115

management experience. That was always the hardest part for me, even
when I became much more experienced. I liked the staff meetings. I ran
them like seminars, had really good staff. I liked giving speeches.
I actually like fundraising because I had a wonderful mentor. The
vice-president for development at Wellesley when I got there--Peter
Buchanan--was one of the really great development officers of our times.
He was recruited away by Columbia shortly thereafter--I never forgave
Columbia for that. But before he left he knew that, with no experience, it
would be very important for me that my first experience of fundraising be a
positive one, because if somebody said, “Oh, no, of course I’m not going to
give you any money,” then I would think, “Ugh!”
[01:00:47] So he set it up that I would go to Los Angeles and meet
there with an alumna who was one of the few women of her generation
who’d been a professional sportswoman--she was a professional golfer-because the main thing we needed--who knew? The main thing we needed
at Wellesley was a replacement for our ancient Mary Hemenway gymnasium,
which was a museum piece. All of our competitors were building these
gorgeous new sports centers, [recognizing the burgeoning interest in
women’s athletics], so that was a really high priority. All right, that’s my job;
I’ve got to do it. I wouldn’t have expected that I was going to start building
a sports center as my first major assignment, but there we are. So he wanted
me to go out and consult this alum from the 1940s who was a sportswoman
as I said, and I went with a trustee from the Los Angeles area who I liked

116

very much. But she was not there to make the ask; she was there to do
conversation and give me moral support.
[01:01:43] So I had to make the ask. Dorothy Johnson Towne after a
little bit of chitchat--said, “Well, I know you’ve come to ask me for money,”
which is a very familiar thing for people to do in this situation. “I know
you’ve come to ask me for money,” even though I hadn’t said anything
about that yet. She said, “I’ve decided what I want to do. I want to give a
fountain, a birdbath in front of the museum.” [laughter] I thought, “A bird
bath in front of the museum? What am I going to say to this?” Later on, by
the way, at Duke--people loved that story, and for our campaign one of the
symbols was a circle with a birdbath in the middle with a line through it--no
bird baths. But I could hardly say that to her. So I said, “Well, Dorothy, it’s
a very interesting idea, but let me tell you what I came to ask you to think
about.”
[01:02:37] So then I made my pitch about a fieldhouse, and I also had
this great inspiration on the plane flying out. I’d had some staff work done
to find out more about her family, and I learned that her husband--a
graduate of Williams College who had recently died, to whom she was very
close--had given a fieldhouse to Williams only about ten years before. So I
said, “Wouldn’t it be wonderful to have his and her fieldhouses in New
England, Wellesley and Williams, both Towne Fieldhouses.”
She thought it was a great idea, and she immediately said yes. And I
thought, “I should’ve asked her for more.” Because it was a naming gift but

117

it was only about a third of the cost of the project. I thought, “I should’ve
asked her for more.” And that’s the spirit of a fundraiser, right? [01:03:23]
And so then I knew I could do it, and it didn’t bother me when
people would say no because I knew that basically I could make the pitch.
People [who have never done it] always assume you’re feeling like a beggar.
You’re going around with your hat in your hand. That’s not the way it feels.
The way it feels is a saleswoman. You’re going to sell your institution
because you’re talking to people who have a lot of money and who are
generous. Your job is to convince them to give it to Wellesley. I mean, there
were times when it was not fun at all, and I just didn’t like some of the
conversations. But Wellesley people and Duke people are very interesting.
Most of it was thought-provoking, and I liked almost everything about the
job of college president--except student protests which were hard to handle,
although I knew that they were certainly within their rights to do it and in
some instances I agreed with them, but they were hard to handle. Most of
all I found management, as I said, difficult. I never did get to the point
where I liked that, hiring and firing people, evaluating them.
[01:04:27] I ran my staff meetings as a seminar, because that’s what I
knew how to do; so one of the first great staff people I hired who became a
lifelong friend said, “You know, when we finish the staff meetings
everybody says, ‘What happens next? Did we just decide anything or not?’“
Because my habit was to listen to what I’d heard, go away and think about
it, and then make a decision. But I sort of forgot to tell anybody what I was
doing. [laughter] So I said, “Okay, well, we’ll have a more proper process

118

where I’ll tell everybody what the next steps will be. And I promise I’ll
announce the decision when it’s made.” You see how much I had to learn?
Anderson: You mentioned that in the beginning you made a few rookie mistakes. Are
there any particular ones that stood out?
Keohane:

[01:05:16] Well, the faculty had let me know that they thought that Wellesley
was top heavy. There were too many administrators, and it seemed to me
there were an awful lot of vice-presidents. I had the sense of what almost all
of them were doing. But there was one delightful woman who was basically
there, I discovered, to hold my predecessor’s hand, because Barbara Newell
was a very fine president in many ways but she was shy. So when she went
to an event, this gregarious vice-president who was a wealthy alum would
introduce her to people and take her around, and I didn’t want anybody
doing that to me. I didn’t need handling. I couldn’t see actually she was
doing very much else. [laughs] That’s not fair entirely, but it was a job which
was primarily support for the president, external affairs in that sense.
[01:06:00] So I basically decided one way to get rid of top-heavy
administration would be to delete that job which meant of course that she
was fired, although I didn’t put it that way. What I didn’t take into account
was that she was a member of a very powerful Wellesley class and a very
popular member of the class, and the alumnae of that class were very upset.
It never occurred to me to stop and think, “Wait a minute, who’s going to
be offended by this decision and what preparation should I do in advance?”
I did learn that lesson. When I made difficult decisions down the line, I
always tried to remember to have peripheral vision, to think about who

119

might be offended, who might have a dog in this fight, and who do I need
to consult with before I announce it. But I didn’t know that at the outset.
Anderson: I was interested in the student protests you mentioned. Do you remember
what they were protesting about and why it was so hard to deal with?
Keohane:

[01:07:01] Oh, of course, of course. In fact you can read about the main
one, which was South African divestment, in Thinking about Leadership. I
mean, I can tell you the story, and I will, but you could get a longer version
of it in Chapter Six. Well, there were two protests that I would talk about.
One was the South African divestment at Wellesley and one was sweat
shops at Duke. I haven’t gotten to Duke yet. It’s already 4:30.

Anderson: We’ll get there.
Keohane:

[01:07:29] So anyway, the protest at Wellesley was in 1987, about that period
of time, about South African divestment. Wellesley trustees had accepted
the Sullivan Principles. I don’t know if you know what they are. The
principles that were announced to judge corporations doing business in
South Africa, and the firms would only pass muster if they could show that
they were doing a lot of good for black South Africans, giving them jobs,
supporting education. And there were even grades of the Sullivan Principles
and the highest were corporations who were very dedicated, like IBM, to
making a real difference in South Africa--computers [for black schools],
things like that.
[01:08:16] So the Wellesley trustees had decided to support South
African investment only for those companies that passed the highest
Sullivan Principles and otherwise we would not hold [the stock of] any

120

companies that do business in South Africa. But many of the students and
some of the faculty felt that we ought to divest entirely, and there was a lot
of sentiment for that on Wellesley’s campus and many others. As it
happened there was a teach-in at the chapel two nights before a crucial
trustee meeting, and I went to listen to what the faculty and students had to
say. I had been wavering myself on whether this was the right answer, the
full Sullivan Principles, and whether divestment was the better answer. I had
been wavering but hadn’t talked to the trustees about that. That night I
decided that the speakers were right, that divestment was the more moral
and appropriate course and also more likely to be politically successful [in
South Africa].
[01:09:19] So I went into the trustee meeting that morning saying,
“Look, I know that we’re voting on the Sullivan Principles and on
investment decisions again, and I must tell you that I’ve come to feel that
divestment is the better alternative.” And I explained why. But I had given
them no warning of this, and so I said, “This is not a vote of no confidence.
This is a moral decision that each of you must make. And so here’s why I
think divestment is the right answer. I understand that many of you may see
it differently. But here’s why I think this is true.” So the vote was like
seventeen to sixteen against changing our policy, but of course I couldn’t
announce the size of the vote. That was against our rules, probably
shouldn’t have done it just now. But I went out on the steps of the library-we were meeting in the library--and a lot of the students were gathered in
front of the library entrance waiting for the decision to be announced. They

121

knew it was going to be discussed. I came out and said that we had decided
to sustain our policy on the Sullivan Principles.
[01:10:26] The students let out a great cry, and they ran to the two
ends of the campus, because there’s only two automobile entrances to the
Wellesley campus, and they lay down in the road over both entrances, which
are also the exits of course, so nobody could leave by automobile. It was a
Friday afternoon and lots of people wanted to go and pick their kids up at
daycare or get off before traffic got too bad--you know, the staff and the
faculty were just frantic. “We’ve got to get out of here!” So the town police
in collaboration with the campus police gathered, and we all consulted and it
turned out--I found out so many things I didn’t know--it turned out you
can’t move somebody physically unless you arrest them. They couldn’t just
pick the students up bodily and put them on the side of the road unless they
arrested them, so they arrested them. Then students--some of them walked,
some of them were sort of helped to the side of the road so people could
move.
[01:11:26] The students would be released on their own recognizance
if they would give their names because they were Wellesley students. They
hadn’t done anything violent. But fifty out of the eighty-six who’d been
lying in the road on the side where I was said they were Winnie Mandela.
They wouldn’t give their names. That meant they couldn’t be released; they
had to go to jail. The Wellesley jail held five people, six people, and the only
alternative was to take them to the Framingham Maximum Security
Women’s Prison where I had volunteered as a student playing basketball.

122

The idea of putting fifty Wellesley students in that prison gave me a
complete cold sweat.
[01:12:13] Fortunately--I mean, here Machiavelli is relevant. Fortuna
came to my aid--fortunately the captain of the Wellesley police was a
member of the National Guard. He called the National Guard offices in
Boston and asked if we could use the Armory, which is a federal building, as
a jail. And they said, “Okay.” [laughs] So we took the students to the
National Guard Armory. We brought--literally we; I was in this all the way-we brought them cots. We brought them hamburgers for dinner. The
student affairs people and the Wellesley police guarded them for the night.
They’d made their point. Then in the morning they gave their names and
they were released. But if he hadn’t been a captain of the National Guard, I
have no idea what we would’ve done.
Anderson: Oh my gosh.
Keohane:

[01:13:02] So that was the most memorable. The one at Duke, the
sweatshops, the students were arguing that--and many students were arguing
this on many campuses--that if we’ve got caps that say Duke and shirts that
say the Blue Devils, we can’t pretend we have nothing to do with
manufacturing them. We can’t claim, “We’re not connected with that.” I
thought their argument was powerful. It seems to me that’s pretty obvious.
You can’t say, “I have no relationship,” with a shirt that has the Blue Devil
on it. So I agreed with them that we had an obligation to find out where
they were made and make sure they weren’t being made by child labor in
sweatshops. Therefore, even though they had at first protested with

123

bullhorns and everything, I was persuaded, and Duke was one of the
founding members of a [Fair Labor organization] that was anti-sweatshop.
Anderson: There are some things I want to talk about that will relate to both Wellesley
and Duke, but can you tell me a little bit about how you ended up at Duke
and the transition from Wellesley?
Keohane:

[01:14:04] When I had been at Wellesley for eleven years or so and we’d just
finished a big capital campaign, it seemed like it was time for a change for
them and for me, not that there was anybody asking me to go, but I think
that after ten or eleven years presidents very seldom are as successful as they
are earlier. You’ve sort of lived out your time and you want to go when
you’re on a high point. We’d just finished the largest capital campaign any
liberal arts college had ever run. It was a big success. We proved that
women would give. There was a myth that women don’t give; only men
give. We broke that myth. We had a fantastic campaign and I figured it was
time to move on.
[01:14:46] I had assumed I would go back to scholarship, which is
what I had really wanted to do, but the chairman of the Duke board of
trustees who was an old friend and had been president of Williams came to
my living room in Wellesley and sat there one summer afternoon and
persuaded me that I shouldn’t quit at this point. I had learned all these
things about administration and here would be a great opportunity at Duke
to be president of a larger institution and a very fine one. And one of the
arguments that he didn’t make, but that was persuasive to me, was going
back to the South, since I’d grown up in the South and I’d also thought it

124

was a region of the country where it’s too bad when people just leave and
don’t come back. I wanted to go back and work for a southern institution.
[01:15:38] So for a variety of reasons I was persuaded, and I got the
job and became president of Duke. I had not intended to go on as a
president but he was right. There were all sorts of things I’d learned and
things I’d wanted to do and I thought it would be intriguing to be at a larger
institution as well.
Anderson: What was different about being at a larger coed research university as
opposed to a smaller liberal arts college?
Keohane:

[01:16:05] The coed wasn’t that different because Wellesley had male faculty
and I had four kids who’d gone to coed schools, and I’d always been part of
one myself except for Wellesley and St. Anne’s. So the coeducation didn’t
matter a whole lot. Well, of course you had to deal with things like
fraternities and that mattered. But what was really different was the medical
school. Wellesley had no medical school of course, and the hospitals--Duke
University Hospitals and Medical Center were a huge proportion of the
budget, of the size and space of the campus, and of the reputation of Duke.
And they thought the rest of us were sort of tagging along and that Duke
Hospital and Duke Medical Center, Duke Medical School were the best
parts about Duke. So it was a difficult thing to come in as a person who
knew almost nothing about medical schools, and doctors always think they
know better than you do about their work when you’re an administrator.
[01:17:00] So that was a challenge all the way along. Also big time
athletics, dealing with Mike Krzyzewski and the men’s basketball team--he

125

was a fascinating guy, too. Mike and I sort of edged warily around each
other for a few months and then decided that each of us had a fundamental
commitment to Duke and to the students of Duke. I began to seek his
advice on other things, and he was a strong ally. That worked out really well,
and I loved Duke basketball games. That was a big plus. Really a big plus,
having a great seat in Cameron Indoor Stadium, having the Blue Devil be
surfed up to sit beside me. That’s great.
[01:17:41] The other new challenge was the deans, because at
Wellesley there were no separate deans of different schools because there
weren’t different schools. But at Duke you had business and law and
engineering and so forth. So I had to get used to being president--I coined
for myself the term flotilla. I was more like being admiral of a flotilla than
the captain of a big ship because each of the little ships had its own captain
and I was supposed to keep them all roughly moving in the same direction
and set the course. So that’s the way it felt.
Anderson: At Wellesley, you were one of a long line of female presidents but that
wasn’t the same for Duke, right?
Keohane:

No, they’d never had a female president. [01:18:26] I was only the third
female president of a major research university. Hanna Gray at Chicago [and
Donna Shalala] at Wisconsin had been the first and second.

Anderson: So I was wondering if you noticed a difference being in a position that lots
of women had been in before you compared to one where you were the
very first.

126

Keohane:

Yes. It was quite different. But it was related in that I had enough selfconfidence to feel I could do the job because I did it at Wellesley. That was
literally the way it felt. So I didn’t go in thinking, “Wow, I’m never going to
be able to do this bigger job.” Much of it is the same, dealing with faculty,
students, staff, buildings, alumni, finances, leaky roofs, whatever it may be.
I’d done that at Wellesley even if on a smaller scale. So I thought, “I can do
this job,” and it didn’t occur to me to lack the self-confidence to do it,
which I didn’t, whereas when I got to Wellesley I didn’t have a lot of selfconfidence but I built it there.
[01:19:25] [I later discovered that] there were quite a few people who
thought, “How can this woman from Wellesley run Duke?” But [being
southerners], they were polite enough not to say it in public. I had sensed
that I had a lot of support and only later down the line did I discover that
some of the trustees had felt this way. By that time they were my friends and
some of my biggest financial supporters and excellent partners, so I forgave
them. But I didn’t know at the time [I was chosen] that they were dubious
that I could do it, and that was very gender related.

Anderson: So at both Wellesley and Duke you had initiatives to increase enrollment of
minority students. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about why that
was important to you and the steps you took to try to get more minority
students involved.
Keohane:

[01:20:22] Well, I think having a more diverse student body and faculty and
staff is really important for a strong institution of higher education because
you don’t learn very much from being with people all like yourselves. It is a

127

powerful part of a fine education. That was one of the main motivations.
The way we did it for students was simply to make sure that the admissions
office knew that we should--although we surely weren’t going to do
something simplistic like admitting people just because they were black--we
should make sure that where there were several equally-qualified students
one of the factors that you would weigh would be their ethnicity, because it
would be an asset to have people of different backgrounds.
Places like Wellesley or Duke have huge numbers of applicants so
what you get is three layers basically: a top layer of people who are shoo-ins,
a bottom layer of people who [don’t have the qualifications to merit serious
consideration], and a huge middle layer of people who could do the job,
who have interesting qualifications, and your task is to figure out which of
that set you will admit. In that mix you’ve got all kinds of choices to make: a
flutist, a soccer player, a person who brings ethnicity, a person who brings
geography, somebody from North Dakota, somebody who brings a
different religion, somebody from India, and you take all of those things
into account. So diversity as such becomes the answer, not “we will admit
more black students” as such. [01:22:02] And for faculty you start paying
attention to searches and having somebody say, “Look, if you’re going to
have a search for a faculty member we need to be sure that you have
appropriately considered people from different backgrounds and not just
called your best friends and say, ‘Who’ve you got coming out of graduate
school?’” Otherwise, that’s what everybody will tend to do.

128

Anderson: Did you notice any differences about this at Duke because it was a southern
school and because of the Greek life there? Does that make it more difficult
to be inclusive?
Keohane:

[01:22:31] Actually the Greek life is a separate issue, and I’ll come back to it.
But given the fact that Durham had always had one of the strongest black
middle-class communities in the whole South it was [easier to recruit
African Americans to Duke than it was to persuade young black women to
come to the Boston area]. Something that I really liked about Duke,
whenever you went to an event either on campus or off campus, there
would be a very healthy sprinkling of African Americans, [including civic
leaders in all areas]. You could count on that. You didn’t even stop and
think about it whereas it was much rarer at Wellesley. It was much rarer at
Princeton. Making sure that the student body reflected the same profile was
in fact a pretty easy sell for Duke. We had a lot of applicants once people
realized that we were serious about it, in part because people saw Duke as a
place with lots of black middle-class professionals around to emulate.
[01:23:29] The fraternity life was not so relevant to minorities. It was
very relevant to gender.

Anderson: I was going to ask about the Women’s Initiative.
Keohane:

Well, even before the Women’s Initiative, it became very clear [women at
Duke faced some challenges]. Most of the fraternity houses were on the
main West Campus corridor, [the path you would generally take to] walk
from the classroom buildings over to the Student Union, Cameron Indoor
Stadium, and the residence halls. So the frat guys would sit on their benches

129

and call out, you know, bad comments about women. That was historically
true; it’s been historically true on almost every campus where that happens.
So [our administrative team, with Board approval], worked out a
reallocation of housing so the frats wouldn’t be right on the main campus.
They would still have housing but many of them would be far back so they
wouldn’t be able to just call out at people walking along all the time.
[01:24:32] One of the things that I wish I’d done more with at Duke
was to tackle the Greek system. We [took some steps like fraternity house
relocation and tougher rules on alcohol]; but the situation didn’t change
fundamentally, and in retrospect I wish I had been bolder about that. It
looked like it would be really hard [to make more fundamental changes]
because the Greek system was very deeply embedded at Duke.
There were also good things about it. Many of the sorority women
found this the best place to feel that they had support and sisterhood. So it
was a complicated situation, but the parties were all run by the frats and they
were fueled by alcohol. One of the [most difficult parts of the situation] is
having the drinking age raised from eighteen to twenty-one. When you
could drink at eighteen, people could have a beer or glass of wine with a
faculty member and it was more a normal part of life. When you [can’t drink
legally at parties], people sometimes deliberately get drunk on vodka before
they leave their dorm rooms, and that’s a very sick way to live.
Anderson: Is that one of the things that you wish you would’ve done more with?
Keohane:

[01:25:34] It’s very hard to do anything about alcohol. But since the frats are
where most of the parties happened, it might have helped.

130

Anderson: So tell me about the Women’s Initiative that came later.
Keohane:

Okay, so when I got to Duke, I had from the beginning the concept that it
would be really important to know more about the lives of women at Duke.
Duke had had a strong Woman’s College instead of being totally integrated
coeducationally. The wonderfully generous and thoughtful and farseeing
founder of Trinity College, Washington Duke, the father of James
Buchanan Duke, had given a significant amount of money [to ensure that
the university would educate women on the same terms as men]. Maybe it
was $150,000--it was a lot of money in 1890--to Trinity College on
condition that it admit women on the same terms as men--which was a very
revolutionary idea, for the South especially. And so the gift was accepted. It
was decided that they would be admitted on the same terms, educated in the
same way, but that there would be a separate campus for women. That
worked quite well until 1970. The women’s college campus was a beautiful
neo-Georgian place. It was about a mile away from the main Gothic
campus. There were buses going back and forth and bicycles and everything.
But the Woman’s College had been a powerful part of Duke. There were
alums, people like Elizabeth Dole and Judy Woodruff and others, who had
gone there, and they remembered it with the same passion that Wellesley
alums remember their college.
[01:27:17] So I thought, “Well, when Duke became fully coed the
Woman’s College was disbanded and the women were now fully accepted
into Duke, but they lost something.” The women who graduated from the
Woman’s College felt the same way. That was just one thing that led me to

131

think, “You know, we really should be paying more attention to the
situation of women.” But I knew that it would be a big mistake to have my
very first initiative, as [former] president of Wellesley and a feminist, be
about women at Duke. I decided at least we would begin to get more
information, because we discovered we knew very little. We had very little
data about women: numbers of, condition of, whatever. We spent some
years gathering data, and I meant to get back to the issue sooner but we got
into questions about various crises. We were running a capital campaign.
There were a lot of other things going on, and it was only toward the end of
my presidency that I was sitting back and thinking, “Okay, now what do I
really want to do before I leave?” I had clearly only two or three years to go,
because I knew I was going to leave when the campaign was over, on the
same pattern as Wellesley.
[01:28:22] So what did I want to do before I left? At the very top of
my list was the Women’s Initiative. I appointed a steering committee, which
I chaired, to think about the situation of women at Duke across the board,
not just undergraduates but graduate students, trustees, staff, faculty, postdocs--not alums, but everybody on campus. It was a very, very good
experience. Really strong people were participants and helped do the
research and writing and make recommendations, and we took some
significant steps.
For example, one of the first things we found was that most graduate
students, post-docs, and young faculty were all saying, “The thing that
would make the most difference in my life is access to better daycare,

132

higher-quality daycare, and assurance that my child can have [access to this
benefit].” Because people were waiting two or three years to get their kids
into daycare at Duke. When the [research for the Initiative] was only a few
months underway, we [heard about this pressing need] from so many people
that we right away started plans to double the size of the Duke daycare
center, even before we had begun to think about writing the report.
Our EVP for finance and administration, Tallman Trask, also had the
idea of providing grants to other good daycare centers in Durham and
Chapel Hill so that in return for the ability to do some upgrading of their
facilities and pay their teachers a little more--which would also lift them into
a top bracket where they could get more state aid--in return for that, they
would reserve a certain number of places for Duke people, which was a
brilliant idea. [01:30:00] We did a number of things like that for faculty and
staff.
For students the main thing we did was to set up the Baldwin
Scholars Program, named after the first dean of the Woman’s College, Alice
Mary Baldwin. The Program admitted students in the first semester of their
freshman year, after they’d gotten to Duke, they knew what it was like.
These were all women students who would then have the opportunity to
[intern together in the summer], take a course together the first semester of
their sophomore year. They would live in a women’s dorm their sophomore
year. They could bring their freshman roommates with them, but it would
be a women’s dorm. After that, they could live anywhere they wanted to.
The program includes a lot of involvement of faculty and staff advisors. So

133

it was a vibrant women’s community within the larger university, and it has
been a great success for the students who participated and for the faculty
who are involved. There’ve been a number of very rigorous evaluations
about how well these students do academically, how many leadership jobs
they take in the university, a number of other measures compared with a
control group of people who had applied for the program but were not
chosen in the end. And it’s just a huge success.
[01:31:28] However, it only affected the relatively small number of
students who were chosen. We had hoped that it would leaven the loaf and
make some changes more broadly at Duke. I don’t think that has happened.
[But those who are in the program find it very rewarding, for the most part];
a number of them had been thinking of transferring [out of Duke before
they were admitted], but they had such a great experience they stayed.
Anderson: It’s like you all were recreating the women’s college experience from before.
Keohane:

Bingo. Bingo.

Anderson: I was wondering about how things that were going on in the outside world
affected your time at Duke. For example, September eleventh happened
during your time that you were there. Do you remember what that was like?
Keohane:

[01:32:06] Oh, yes. Several people at Duke had friends or relatives who were
killed, and there were eleven Duke alumni killed. And some of the students
had parents or friends of parents who were killed. It hit pretty hard. I
remember going to a service where we talked about it and consoled people.
I remember a lot of things being done the first few days after it happened
and then there was so much to think about. Bob and I then finally decided

134

for a break, when there was nothing more we could do, to go to Wilmington
and Wrightsville Beach for the weekend. Bob fell asleep in the car on the
way down. I was listening to classical public radio [as they were playing]
Fauré’s Requiem. [When they came to the passage about] “let them rest in
peace,” I started crying. I had to pull over to the side of the road. I realized
that [the enormity of the event] was finally hitting me; I had had so much to
do to help Duke people deal with it, I hadn’t dealt with it myself. We
planted eleven magnolia trees on campus for the alumni who had died,
which have grown beautifully. So yes, it hit the campus pretty hard.
Anderson: In 1995, which I guess is a bit of backtracking, you were inducted into the
National Women’s Hall of Fame. I wanted to know like what that meant to
you and how it felt at the time.
Keohane:

Oh, it was immensely rewarding. I was nominated by Judy Woodruff who is
a Duke alum and a Duke trustee. Having her support was really wonderful
because it was relatively early. I had only been president of Duke for two
years or something. I was fortunate to be chosen, and it was a very
rewarding experience. I haven’t been back to another induction ceremony,
but I have been one of the reviewers of potential candidates for admission
and given some support financially. So it’s been an important part of my life
in that way.

Anderson: So stepping back and looking at both your time at Duke and Wellesley,
especially given you have this book you’ve published about it, what would
you say are the lessons you took away about the purpose of higher

135

education and what needs to change to make it better to achieve that
purpose? I know that’s kind of a broad question.
Keohane:

[01:34:48] Well, the speech that I gave yesterday at the Stanford Faculty
Senate [anniversary celebration] would be one answer. I don’t know quite
how to answer that question. There are just so many things. I think the
mission of a really great institution of higher learning has to do both with
fine research and fine teaching, the discovery and transmission of
knowledge, but also service to the community and helping students develop
through residential experience an awareness of their obligations to the world
beyond themselves. Not just to envision their own future success but also
think about how they can use their education to help others. I think all of
those things are important to higher education.
We’ve talked about how diversity is important, about the search for
truth, not that I think truth is some objective Platonic thing out there, but I
think that together, collectively, we can get closer to what we would all
regard as a kind of truth. So there are so many things. But you have to
remember, I’ve spent my whole life in education. I’ve never done anything
else. I know my sister is equally passionate about journalism, and I know
other people are about medicine, but I mean, it’s my profession. It’s what I
care most about.

Anderson: You said that you initially went into this administrative segment of your
career thinking about what would it be like to hold a position of power. At
the end of that, what did you conclude?

136

Keohane:

[01:36:24] Well, I learned that it was kind of nice. [laughs] It’s funny because
I wouldn’t have expected to say that until I had done it for a while. I
discovered it’s really fascinating to have the ability to make a difference. And
you learn that you don’t want to claim credit, sometimes even when you
should be given the credit--you know, somebody should realize that you’d
made a big difference. But often the best thing that you do is to let other
people take the credit; Nelson Mandela said it. “Let other people think it
was their idea.”
I remember once at Wellesley I was pushing for a particular Gen-Ed
course idea. I had not made a big deal of it because it was really important
that the faculty at Wellesley deal with this as a faculty initiative, which in
many ways it was. I was very supportive, but I hadn’t spoken a lot about it. I
didn’t want to kill it by having it be “the president’s thing.” One of our
friends [on the Wellesley faculty] ran into Bob [when they were giving
blood]. The friend said, “I want to tell you, I’m really worried because
there’s this great idea about general education. We don’t know how Nan
feels about it.” I thought, “Okay, lovely.” Right? I mean, I was [very much
involved in launching the idea]. But having other people take credit [was
both rewarding for them and strategically smart].
[01:37:43] I also learned the importance of consultation, and the
importance of decision making in a timely fashion. It’s a very useful skill.
You don’t wait until you have so much information that you’re flooded by it
because then the moment may have passed, but you also don’t go off halfcocked. Decision making is a skill [that depends heavily on] timing, and you

137

only learn that by doing it. I learned the importance of good judgment. I
think I do have pretty good judgment and that’s so important to good
leadership. I learned an awful lot about having power and about leadership.
[01:38:15] But I didn’t realize how much I [had gotten used to having
power, and come to like it], until I didn’t have it anymore, and I’ll tell you
how that happened. When I stopped being president of Duke in 2004, we’d
already accepted positions at Princeton, but we both had sabbaticals
coming. I went back, of course, once more to the Center for Advanced
Study up on the hill at Stanford and had a fantastic year. I didn’t miss
anything. I just loved being back at Stanford and I loved being able to do
my own work. I was [beginning to think about the book that became
Thinking about Leadership], and finding it fascinating finally to be able to
reflect on leadership. So that was a great year.
[01:38:53] The next year at Princeton, I missed my executive
assistant. I’m very bad at keeping my own schedule and I missed having
somebody keep it for me, answer requests for things--I really missed that.
The year after that I missed the sense of academic ceremony because at
Wellesley or Duke when I walked down the aisle of the chapel, of course, I
was representing the university. I was wearing the seal of the university.
People would be snapping my picture as the president of Wellesley or
whatever. That was a great feeling, not so much having my picture snapped,
but being the representative of the institution, which I love. And of course
you don’t have that opportunity if you’re not [in a position of authority]-however much you may love an institution, if you’re not wearing that seal, if

138

you’re not the one who’s ultimately responsible, [you may be walking down
the aisle in your cap and gown as a faculty member], but it’s different.
[01:39:53] Only the third year out when I was at Princeton did I
realize what I was missing [in terms of power]. The occasion was this: the
dean of the Woodrow Wilson School Anne-Marie Slaughter went on
sabbatical; she is also a very good friend. She and I both thought it would be
a really good idea to have a program in a school of public policy which
would help women who had stopped out to raise their kids get back on the
job market, which is notoriously a very difficult thing to do. There aren’t
many “on ramps.” We thought it would be a good idea to give Princeton
graduates who had stopped out but who had also already made a
professional career, who had post-graduate degrees, MDs or JDs or PhDs
or whatever, but had left their jobs to raise their kids and wanted to get back
in--to help them think about the potential of going back into government
and training them a little bit to get them ready to do that. Help them with
their resumes, raise their self-confidence, teach them computer skills,
whatever. We thought it would be a really good idea.
[01:40:50] The dean went on sabbatical and left me in charge of a
committee to make this happen. However, quite a few people on the
committee, in fact a majority didn’t think this was a great idea at all. They
had all kinds of reservations about it. “We can’t do this in a week or so. We
can’t spend a whole semester on it. This won’t work for all these various
reasons.” And after one particular meeting where they all sort of said “nah,
nah, nah,” and left, I sat there at the table by myself and I said to myself,

139

“You know, if I were president, I would say, ‘Thank you very much. I’ve
heard your views. Now this is what we’re going to do,’ and everybody would
go off and do it.” [Anderson laughs]
That’s power and that’s what I missed. I know now how it feels
different, to have an equally important assignment and feel your arguments
are equally good and you’re consulting the same way, but you don’t have the
power of ultimately making the decision and having everybody go off and
do it. If you use that wisely, it’s a very exhilarating feeling, and you can
understand how people are so reluctant to give it up, how people such as
these horrible dictators hold on forever, how people who are 84 want to run
for Senate once again. I mean, at one level that seems ridiculous, but once
you have power it’s sort of an intoxicating beverage. You get used to it.
Anderson: Do you think some of what’s gone wrong in the political climate today has
to do with people wanting power too much?
Keohane:

[01:42:22] But that’s true of any political climate ever. I don’t want to get
into current politics because by the time this becomes oral history it won’t
be current.

Anderson: If you need to stop we can stop, but also I could ask a couple more
questions.
Keohane:

I need to stop at 5:15 in order to finish getting ready for Shanghai and make
the dinner engagement.

Anderson: Well, then we’ll just talk about a couple things just to sum up. I did want to
ask about one more activism-related thing, which was during your time on

140

the Harvard Corporation, there was this whole fossil fuel divestment
controversy. Do you remember that?
Keohane:

[01:43:08] [laughs] Man, I mean, come on. Do I remember it? I was--that’s
something I can’t really talk about, though, because I was on the
corporation committee. In fact I chaired for a while the corporation
committee on social responsibility, which is given the responsibility of
dealing with that issue. Its proceedings are totally confidential, and I can’t
really talk about it. But I certainly do I remember it.

Anderson: That’s fine. Because when I was reading about your time on the Harvard
board there was a lot of controversy swirling around that.
Keohane:

Yeah. Tell me about it, yeah.

Anderson: [laughs] You got some flak for some comments that you made.
Keohane:

[01:43:47] I know; the comments were so taken out of context, but it was a
silly thing to say. Well, BP had done something good at that time, was what
I said. In fact [BP had taken a positive step but I shouldn’t have spoken
because I didn’t know enough about it, and by the time I said it BP had
done something very controversial and negative as well. Making this off-thecuff remark was] a silly thing to do and it came back into my face so often.
But that’s in the public domain so you already know that.

Anderson: As you know from all of your experience leading things, it’s really hard to
have that level of scrutiny, I’m sure, and everything you say people can
remember and throw back at you.
Keohane:

[01:44:19] But I had never before had quite that experience [of being
publicly castigated for an off-hand comment, although I surely faced

141

significant criticism for actions I had taken, or policies I had endorsed, as
president]. That’s interesting--I had never thought about that. I remember
silly things like when I was at Duke I learned that I had mandated that
nobody could wear open-toed shoes. And I thought, “Hello? What?”
Somebody thought I had said something, god only knows what--I don’t
think I ever did--about open-toed shoes. But it is true that you cannot float
trial balloons, saying, “Well, maybe it would be really interesting to try this,”
because somebody at the table will take that as your decision and go off and
do it. So I found that you had to be more careful with your words. But I
never felt until that time at Harvard that something I had said--not only was
it an unwise thing to say, but it was plastered all over and used viciously. I
never thought about this, but luckily I don’t think I ever had that happen at
Wellesley or at Duke. It doesn’t feel good. [laughs]
Anderson: No, I’m sure it doesn’t. What would you say to the activists who do that sort
of thing and who are so angry at the administration? What do you wish they
understood from your perspective, either as a trustee member or just as an
administrator?
Keohane:

[01:45:48] Well, if you think back to the Wellesley divestment issue, the
students had a very clever strategy. They probably knew more about what
happened when you got arrested than I did because they’d already thought
ahead to [saying their names were] Winnie Mandela. But they were playing
fair. They were doing what they wanted to do, and they were ready to take
the consequences. That’s different from taking somebody’s words and
twisting them out of context and using them over and over again.

142

The other really difficult one was about the same time [as the
divestment crisis], we had a town meeting at Wellesley about diversity
because the students felt we weren’t doing nearly enough to recruit African
American students and faculty, to have courses on African American
subjects, et cetera. So the town hall had some pretty bitter moments, but it
wasn’t ad hominem, so to speak. They weren’t saying, “You as president are
just saying all these stupid things.” It was more they didn’t agree with me,
they were pushing back, but that’s their right. So it’s really odd. As I said, I
never thought about it, that the bit at Harvard was for me unprecedented. I
must have been very lucky, [or perhaps only more careful in what I said
casually as president].
Anderson: Finally, I just want to know if there’s anything at all, either from the topics
we covered today or last time, that you feel like we should go back to or that
you wanted to say more about, just in these last couple minutes.
Keohane:

[01:47:23] I don’t think so. We’ve talked about how much I love teaching
and research and how much I love Stanford, how I’m glad I had that stint in
administration and I think I’m both a better political scientist and probably a
better person because of it. I certainly learned a great deal. So when I think
about the two roads and the choice I make, I think it would’ve been
wonderful to stay at Stanford and write that book on eighteenth-century
thought and continue to work hard on feminist theory and maybe write a
really interesting book on feminist thought and have my kids grow up here
and have Bob happily remain here. That would’ve been a wonderful life. It’s
interesting. I always say that my biggest achievement professionally is the

143

book on France. And then people say, “Wait a minute! Weren’t you
president of Duke?” Yes, but to me, even though that was very rewarding
and very important it wasn’t as important as a single accomplishment.
However, in terms of [my talents and skills], I probably had more of an edge
after I learned how to be an administrator, after I learned what it takes,
compared with myself as a scholar. I think I’m a very good scholar. I think
Philosophy and the State in France is a great book. I think I’m a very fine
teacher. But being a college president is a more unusual thing to do and to
do well, and [my skills and talents seem to be well-suited to] certain aspects
of that--not all of it, but the speeches, the fundraising, the symbolizing the
university, the reaching out to people, the making decisions. It may be a
more unusual gift--well, it’s not a more unusual gift. Being a fine scholar is
probably the most unusual gift there is. But it may be that I’m better at
certain parts of administration, and therefore that I made more of a
contribution to the world by being president of Wellesley and president of
Duke than I would have done if I’d stayed and written those books and
taught. I don’t know, but you could argue that that’s true, and therefore I
think it probably was the right decision.
