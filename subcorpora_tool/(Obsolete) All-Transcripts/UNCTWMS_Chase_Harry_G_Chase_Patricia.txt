David Cline: Okay, so we've established today is May the 25th, [Laughs] 2010, and this is David Cline for the Southern Oral History Program.  I am in Knoxville, Tennessee with the Chases, and if you would both introduce yourselves, and what I&#8217;d like to do is start with some background on each of you, sort of a little bit of a family history to get to know you and to get a sense of where you were raised and the families and what may have led you to the kind of work that you ended up doing, so we spend a little time just getting kind of a family history and then a life and work history and get you to where you are today.
Harry Chase: My name is Harry Chase and I&#8217;m seventy-four years old.  I was brought up in Boston, Massachusetts.  I left Boston for a period of time to go over to Europe after the Second World War.  I was there in &#8217;46.  We were one of the first families to go to Germany after the war.  My father was over there working and we spent three years there.  Then we came back and I graduated from Newton High School in Boston.
DC: So how old were you when you were in Germany?
HC: I was ten or eleven when I went over there, so I never forgot it.
DC: I mean that must have been--.
HC: It was bombed.  I mean we went to--
DC: --an amazing time.
HC: --Frankfurt and there was very little of the city, and we finally--.  [After a year] we moved to Mannheim which had no--destroyed; it was completely bombed.  So I guess I got some exposure to that kind of thing, to the war.  Anyway, I graduated from Newton High School and went to Purdue for two years in pre-med, then I left school and went in the Air Force for four years, came out, went back to Northeastern, got my degree in industrial management engineering with an engineering and accounting, I guess, major.  Anyway, then I went to work in Boston for several firms, worked my way up, and came to Tennessee, went to Europe to work for eight years in England.
DC: What kind of work?
HC: I was working in production engineering and materials control primarily my first eight years.  That wasn&#8217;t actually true.  It wasn&#8217;t eight years, it was I guess five, but I went into management at that time because I&#8217;d say after five, six years I went into supervision, ultimately worked my way up to be the president of a company.  I was with AG&amp;G, which is a Boston firm.  I was there for twenty-one years but I worked for RCA and Bell &amp; Howell and AT&amp;T in my career.
DC: All in this area?
HC: Yeah, in this area, but I ended up running engineering groups and I ran manufacturing--.  Well one place I ran was the thermal engineering company, Whiteville Engineering.  I was general manager.  They sold me off to a private company so I became the president of the company when they sold it off.  Most of my career&#8217;s been in high tech areas.  I was involved with a PET scanner and a lot of technology, so although I was a lousy engineer I learned to be able to understand a lot of the terminology.  Although I never could really do it I understood the concepts, so I worked in that area.  But my main--.
DC: Made for a good manager.
HC: Yeah.  My main focus was on people and management of people, and when I ran my company I tried to have a company that was what you call a benevolent benefactor.  But our objective was to ensure that everybody was treated with respect and so I had a company where the people--.  Like myself; I was only allowed to make ten percent more than my manager next to me and when bonuses came out the employees got the bonuses first, so it was a structure that produced a lot of profits [Laughs] because it was people oriented.  I found the more you relate to the people and share the wealth the more benefit it is to everyone.   So, most of my life was spent on that.
DC: Where do you think you came to that way of thinking?
HC: Well my family has--.  I grew up with my grandparents primarily because my father was overseas a lot, so my grandfather was a very, very generous person, and my grandmother, and they gave a lot to the church and to institutions, and I think they taught me a lesson: Whatever you have is a gift and you share it, given an opportunity to do things, and what you have is a gift, so I believe in that and I think you should--.  The reason I retired was to give my life back to the poor, really.  I lost my first wife in England but--.  I went into hospice for eight years.  Matter of fact, when we came back from California, the last place I worked, we decided to go work at hospice, and we did it for a year and I don&#8217;t think it was--.  I just don&#8217;t know.  I didn&#8217;t feel--.  I wanted to get back in the mountains and do something up there, I guess.  I don&#8217;t know.  Hospice was fun and rewarding, but it was a time to get out of it for me personally.
So I started working up in the mountains in 1998 and Patty and I--and I&#8217;ll let her come in, because that&#8217;s when we started working up there was 1998 with a group called ADFAC, which is Aid to Distressed Families in Appalachian Counties, and they had us up there and they asked us to go up to Campbell County and open a satellite office to work with housing issues, so that&#8217;s how we started.
DC: Okay.
HC: But that&#8217;s a quick background.  I can&#8217;t think of anything else.  I have three sons and three stepchildren.  I&#8217;m trying to think of any major other thing in my life.
DC: [Laughs]
HC: [Laughs] Now everything was a major experience.
DC: Right, right.
HC: But, you know.  The Air Force was sort of fun.  I learned a lot about the Air Force.  In fact in the Air Force I learned about segregation because I&#8217;d never been involved with racial issues.  When we were in basic training we were all from Boston and we went to San Antonio and they wouldn&#8217;t serve a couple of the blacks--.
DC: What year was this?
HC: This was in 1956.
DC: &#8217;56, okay.  So things are supposed to be integrated by that point.
HC: Yeah.  It&#8217;s the first time I ever got hit by that, so it was an interesting experience.  It was a hard time because a lot of us--I mean we were friends and we had to break our friendship.  We had to separate and we never came together again.
DC: Really?
HC: Never.  They just--.  My black friends were embarrassed, I guess we were embarrassed, and that was the end of it.  We never could come together again.  The service at that time was integrated but it was really segregated, so.
DC: Right.  I mean on paper it&#8217;s supposed to be integrated.
HC: Yeah but it wasn&#8217;t.  Well, you could say--.  We worked together but it was hard to be friends.  But I mean some of us were.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, we were friends, but we couldn&#8217;t--.  I don&#8217;t know.  You know it&#8217;s a hard time to describe.  It just was always an us-and-them sort of situation.  I don&#8217;t know.
DC: And that was built in.  Yeah, interesting.
HC: So that&#8217;s--.  If there&#8217;s any other questions--.
DC: Yeah, well we&#8217;ll come back to--.  Let&#8217;s hear from you, Patty.
PC: I&#8217;m Patty Chase and I&#8217;m sixty-eight years old.  I was born in Louisville, Kentucky and went to school, graduated from high school, went two years to a small school in Kentucky, Centre College, and then I graduated from the University of Louisville in education.  Married a physician and he was in the Air Force so we traveled, and while traveling in the meantime had three kids and ended up here in Knoxville in &#8217;71 or &#8217;72.  I guess most of my life I&#8217;ve been a volunteer.  I had a teaching certificate and I taught early on in Louisville in the inner city schools but then when we came here I just raised my kids and worked with different kinds of people in different situations.  Always had a strong church background, was raised in a very strong family situation with my mother and father and two brothers, and somewhere down the line got a divorce and met Harry and married him and then traveled with him to Boston and California and then we ended up back here, and that&#8217;s about it.  When we came back here actually we were going to work with the Salvation Army,--
HC: Oh, that&#8217;s right, yeah.
PC: --was our original intent when we came back.
HC: That&#8217;s right.
PC: And came here to Knoxville, lived downtown Knoxville, and the people there--we went down and we said, here we are, and it just didn&#8217;t work.  It just didn&#8217;t work.  Harry was not really happy working in inner city type situations.  We did the hospice thing and we loved that.  That was wonderful.  Then actually Harry&#8217;s son, who&#8217;s a priest, was in Norris, Tennessee and was working and he said we need some people up in the mountains working with housing, as Harry said, and that&#8217;s how we kind of got started with ADFAC.  While working up there we were taken to places, little towns, little areas, where we had never been before and we thought that the places in LaFollette--which I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve been there yet--
DC: Not yet.
PC: --anyway, in La Follette and Caryville and Jacksboro were poorer until we went up, or Harry went up, one day to look at a family up in White Oak, and that&#8217;s when--.  It was just love at first sight, I think, for him.  I think he just said, this is the place that needs me, this is the area that needs me, so that&#8217;s when he started working up there and we started working up there.  He built a dormitory up there along with some other people and they bring in hundreds of people now to work in the mountains.  That&#8217;s the White Oak Dormitory and that has to do with the Henderson Settlement, which is in Frakes, Kentucky.  It&#8217;s a Methodist organization.
DC: Okay.  White Oak is in Tennessee or--?
HC: It&#8217;s in--you&#8217;re going to go right through it.
DC: Okay.
HC: It&#8217;s a small town on the way.  You&#8217;re going to go up on what they call 90 East and you&#8217;ll drive over to Clairfield and that area.  It&#8217;s Campbell County, Clairfield.
DC: Is it near--?  Jellico is the town that I--.
HC: Jellico is where I do most of the work now.
DC: Okay.
HC: That&#8217;s the town--.  Are you going to meet Marie Cirillo in Jellico?
DC: Yeah.
HC: Okay.  You&#8217;re not going up to where she lives?
DC: No, I&#8217;m meeting her at--
HC: Okay.  Well White Oak&#8217;s on the way to her.
DC: --someplace.  I don&#8217;t know where--
PC: [Laughs]
DC: --I&#8217;m going but I have directions. [Laughs]
PC: Okay.  So anyway, Harry was working with building things and getting people in to help build homes and I think the realization came that who needed help up there were the children.  They were just kind of forgotten and they weren&#8217;t getting the education that they needed and they didn&#8217;t have the homes that they needed.  So he started working with children and then eventually we started a camp, a summer camp--Arts and Crafts, we called it--in Jellico in the Methodist church, and we got help from the Episcopal Church as far as money was concerned and we started with I think two kids and that grew, and then over the next few years we brought it to, what, thirty kids?  So we had them for two weeks and we would do arts and crafts, take them swimming, take them on field trips to Knoxville to the science museum to show them other things, and then that developed into another camp.
DC: Would these kids have otherwise gotten out of the area where they are?  Do they come to Knoxville otherwise?
PC: No.
HC: Oh, no.  They have no transportation.
PC: No, no.  And through all of this a lady from Chattanooga became interested and now she comes up and she takes the kids to--.  She took them to Washington, D.C.; she took them to Kanuga to Camp Bob; she takes them to Chattanooga.  Because they just felt like these kids needed to see that there was something else out there.  So that&#8217;s developed into--.  We also now have a camp that we do with the Episcopal Church where we take kids from the area down to Grace Point, which is an Episcopal camp, and we also have developed another camp for children of incarcerated persons.  It&#8217;s called Camp for Kids and it&#8217;s named after a man that used to work in the prison system, Jim Ewer.  So we work with that.
HC: That&#8217;s the focus Patty has done.  She&#8217;s built up these camps.  We belong to a group which is part of Episcopal missions.  It&#8217;s Appalachian Resource Ministerial Team.
DC: Right.
HC: Marita Pratt probably told you about that.  We were involved in starting that.  We didn&#8217;t start it; a group of us started it.  But Patty has been an advocate for the camps and taken the camp we started up in Jellico and come up with a ministry for the [16:07] children in prison and then she&#8217;s tied in with Carolyn Doster out of Chattanooga to do the camps that go over to Washington.  I&#8217;ve gone a different path sort of, different way.
DC: So what&#8217;s your work primarily?
HC: My focus is on abused children and women really.
PC: You should tell him about your CASA work.
HC: I&#8217;m a CASA volunteer.  I&#8217;m a Court Appointed Special Advocate in Campbell County so I do that, but primarily I&#8217;m working as an advocate prior--.
DC: What does that stand for?
HC: I&#8217;m sorry?
DC: CASA?
HC: Yeah, it&#8217;s a national organization.  It&#8217;s Court Appointed Special Advocates, so they&#8217;re in every county.  Well that&#8217;s not true.  They&#8217;re in a lot of counties. [Laughs]
PC: They&#8217;re in a lot of counties.
HC: They&#8217;re a pretty big organization.
DC: And what county are you--?
HC: Campbell County.  I work up there.
DC: Okay.
HC: And working enough with the families--.  As Patty said we built--.  We got up there and what happened when we had the office in Jellico--I&#8217;m sorry, in La Follette-- was that we used to work with different ministries that brought people up into Appalachia, so Appalachia ministries.  I can&#8217;t think of all of them.  There&#8217;s Confrontation Point Ministries and Appalachian Proj--.
PC: Service Project, ASP.
HC: Appalachian Service Project, ASP.  They&#8217;re big housing units.  They bring in thousands of children every year, or young people--not children, young people--to work on housing, so we used to coordinate some of that.  We&#8217;d go around to the different people and tell them we were going to have a certain number of people come in the area and they would do service work, so we&#8217;d go identify projects for these organizations.  Well that&#8217;s when we, as Patty said, we got up to White Oak and then nobody came up there because there&#8217;s no housing for the volunteers.
DC: Right, okay.
HC: So a church in Chattanooga and Jim Hudson and I converted this daycare center to a dormitory for the Methodist Church.  And then, like Patty said, housing is just a minor part of the problem, although I shouldn&#8217;t say that because it creates stress for the children, the housing situation, so it is important but more important is the parents, and that&#8217;s a disaster up there. [Laughs] It&#8217;s a disaster.  So that&#8217;s where I&#8217;ve been putting all my focus and ultimately we built a daycare center, which took three years to get this church converted to a daycare center.  We finally got it open October 12 and we now have sixteen children, ages two to five.
DC: And that&#8217;s in--?
HC: It&#8217;s in Jellico.
DC: In Jellico, okay.
HC: Yeah, it&#8217;s at the Wesleyan church.
PC: Actually you could see that tomorrow.
HC: Actually if you get a second off you could take Marie--.  I don&#8217;t even know if Marie Cirillo knows it&#8217;s there.  I think she does.
PC: I think she does.
HC: She doesn&#8217;t get involved with that.
DC: It&#8217;s in the Methodist church?
HC: Yeah, it&#8217;s in--no, Wesleyan church.
DC: Wesleyan.
HC: It&#8217;s across from the high school.  Matter of fact, will I be up there tomorrow?  No, I won&#8217;t be.
PC: No, you have something [19:22].
HC: I would be normally but tomorrow I&#8217;ve got something at church so I can&#8217;t, but I usually work Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in the day school.
So, I have written a lot of papers on the area, some have been published.  In my spare time I do a lot of statistics on the profile of the area.  I&#8217;ve been working on trauma with children for seven years now, studying it, trying to figure out what we can do to help these children because the state and the system does not address care for children properly.  There&#8217;s just a big void there when it comes to children, and especially--and I&#8217;m going to say this--Appalachia is a white problem really.  It&#8217;s not an Afro-American, black, problem, people of color problem.  It&#8217;s white so people don&#8217;t realize that when they look at statistics and they look at the bias that--.  I use this in a thing I give, a workshop.  If you look at the eight counties contiguous to Campbell County there&#8217;s a hundred and eighty thousand people.  Ninety-seven point x are white, so they tell you that--.  They&#8217;ll come out and say that seventy-six percent of the blacks are in poverty in that profile.  Well that&#8217;s true, but there&#8217;s only four thousand blacks and there&#8217;s forty-three thousand whites in poverty.  It&#8217;s not to diminish the problem with the blacks, because it&#8217;s terrible, prejudice and things, but the white children up there are just suffering tremendously and it&#8217;s a real problem and nobody has really focused on that group of children and the anxiety they&#8217;re going through and the trauma.  It&#8217;s just tremendous.
DC: Is it difficult to focus in on one issue or one area to work on, being that the issues are so interrelated?
HC: It&#8217;s difficult because it&#8217;s so--.  Yeah, it is difficult because it&#8217;s very difficult to, one, make people understand how critical it is to us to get help from people outside to come in and help support the changes needed, and one of the biggest problems that people have done in Appalachia--and we always talk about this--organizations and people come in and out of that area and they go back to universities, they go back to organizations, and they write about it but nobody stays there and tries to solve the problem.  You know what I mean?
DC: Right.
HC: It really needs a lot of attention.  One of my complaints about some of the universities--and I&#8217;m not saying you. [Laughs]
DC: No, no. [Laughs] It&#8217;s fair.
HC: These universities, is they tend to do a--.  They&#8217;ll come in and profile an area and study it and they&#8217;ll come up with a history but the history is always there and it&#8217;s--.  The history has dragged the change down.  In other words there&#8217;s so much emphasis on history that people aren&#8217;t taking and asking a different question.  You know what I mean?  They&#8217;re always asking about what happened with the coal mining industry when it left, what happened, the transition and the people.  They never try to ask another question: Well where are you today?
DC: Right.
HC: You know?  And what are we doing today?  And you&#8217;ll find a lot of people up there, if they&#8217;ve got to go in and talk about problems that happened twenty years ago, and of course they&#8217;re relevant today because they haven&#8217;t changed.
DC: Right.
HC: So it&#8217;s a box that you got to break out of.
PC: Another problem they have up there is there are no jobs.
HC: Right.
PC: And the education--
HC: Is terrible.
PC: --is terrible.  They&#8217;ve gotten to the point where they can&#8217;t even--.  They were thinking they could have a call in center but the people can&#8217;t even get on the phone and carry on a conversation, so it&#8217;s even below that level.
HC: Language.
DC: Right.
PC: So it&#8217;s a huge problem.
HC: Yeah, it is.
DC: So--
HC: It&#8217;s all--.
DC: --no education, no jobs, no place to live.
HC: The classical trap.
DC: Yeah.
HC: So the question though, and the thing I have been fortunate, actually, I&#8217;ve been blessed by it, because I&#8217;ve been able to work with a group of people that have been in abusive situations for generations and the thing I&#8217;ve learned is I haven&#8217;t been in an office in Knoxville or someplace, or had them here in my home; I&#8217;ve been in their homes and worked with mother, daughter, grandmother that have all been abused, been through an abusive situation, so it&#8217;s really focused my attention on that one area.  I finally have come to the conclu--.  Well I haven&#8217;t come to any conclusion really, yet, but--. [Laughs] My thinking is that the situation, the anxiety level is so severe, [and] when you mix trauma into it you&#8217;re in a dangerous situation where there&#8217;s no hope, and that&#8217;s the worst thing, no hope.  You&#8217;ve eliminated any chance for somebody to have any--.  Well self esteem&#8217;s important too, of course, but hope; that&#8217;s a sad state when you&#8217;re in a situation where there&#8217;s no hope.
DC: And that&#8217;s what you see a lot.
HC: Oh, yeah, you see a lot of it, and you want to try to get back at the children at an early age, and we focus on two to five, really younger, two to three, to try to give them some self esteem and try to prepare them for crisis as much as possible in a school environment, because that&#8217;s what their lives are.  There&#8217;s going to be crisis.  They go into homes that aren&#8217;t adequate.  They&#8217;re exposed to things that most people aren&#8217;t exposed to at those ages because of the confinement of where they live.  They can&#8217;t escape it, that&#8217;s the trouble.  They can&#8217;t escape to a place of safety.  They&#8217;re trapped in a four hundred square foot trailer with thin walls so they&#8217;re exposed to sexual acts, they&#8217;re exposed to pornography, they&#8217;re exposed to all kinds of junk that normal children can get away from, they can escape from.  These children can&#8217;t and if you see an abusive situation you&#8217;ll find that they&#8217;re trapped even more so because the care givers won&#8217;t let them out of the environment, so they trap them in a trailer, say.  They won&#8217;t go to daycares, they won&#8217;t go to preschool, they don&#8217;t go to Head Start and people never know they&#8217;re there, so by the time they get into the school system and they&#8217;ve been abused they don&#8217;t make it, and there&#8217;s a lot of them.  And I&#8217;m not just talking about sexual abuse; I&#8217;m talking emotional and physical.
PC: And also in the area where Harry works and where we go to, it&#8217;s right on the Kentucky/Tennessee border and sometimes people can&#8217;t get help.  The police are so far away by the time they get there it&#8217;s over or the people are gone.  It&#8217;s a huge problem.  It&#8217;s a huge problem.
HC: There&#8217;s one sheriff that covers I think--.  I can&#8217;t remember what he told me.  I might be wrong saying this but I thought he said three hundred square miles, so he covers from Stinging Creek up to the border of Claiborne County, Kentucky, which is a huge area.
PC: Very mountainous.
HC: Now that&#8217;s not the Jellico place.  That&#8217;s the sheriff of Campbell County, so there&#8217;s--.  Oh, yeah, another thing: Drugs have infiltrated the family  I mean there&#8217;s an inordinate number of children born in utero with drugs, just all over the place.  I&#8217;d say eighty percent of the people I work with are on drugs or affected by it.
DC: Is it methamphetamine in that area?
HC: Methamphetamines and opiates.
DC: Okay.
HC: OxyContin and things like that.
DC: Oh, right, of course.
PC: Also there&#8217;s a lot of marijuana grown up there too.
HC: Yeah, there&#8217;s marijuana growing, but that doesn&#8217;t--.  I don&#8217;t see any of that really.  I mean you know people are smoking pot but I&#8217;ve never run into a big--.  They had a big bust up there last year--this year.  I think it was a hundred something thousand dollars worth of drugs that was supposed to be a Mexican cartel up there, growing drugs.  Anyway, I never saw it.  I never bumped into it although I bump into a lot of drugs.
DC: Are there social services in place?
HC: Department of Human Services is there.  The hospital is in trouble.  The community hospitals are all--.  This one&#8217;s practically bankrupt.  The people--
DC: Is there a community health--?
HC: --in La Follette and the people in the southern part of the county have very little to do with the northern part and the people in the northern part are suspicious of the southerners anyway.  They don&#8217;t even want them up there.  Right now they just don&#8217;t want to see them because they just never have supported it.
PC: There are a few clinics around.
HC: Oh, yeah, there&#8217;s healthcare clinics pocketed through the mountains, small clinics.
DC: Community healthcare or for profit?
HC: They&#8217;re run by the state.
DC: Okay.
HC: Health clinics.  There are some that are run by the churches, I mean by the Adventists, maybe.  I don&#8217;t know.  I don&#8217;t know if Indian Mountain--.
PC: The hospital up there is Seventh Day Adventist.
HC: Yeah, the hospital is Adventist but it&#8217;s state.  I&#8217;m trying to think of--.  I think Indian Mountain is supported by the state but that&#8217;s church run, I think.  I&#8217;m not sure.
PC: And as far as churches are concerned everyone thinks that everyone goes to church up there but that&#8217;s just not true.
HC: Twenty-five percent if they&#8217;re lucky.
DC: Okay, yeah.
PC: So sometimes when we take kids to camp, and the camp we take them to usually is a Christian camp--we tell them that it is--and nothing is ever forced on them or anything.
HC: We don&#8217;t push any kind of faith on them.
DC: Right.
PC: But it&#8217;s all new to them.
HC: It&#8217;s interesting because if they get mad at a pastor up there, he&#8217;s Baptist, they&#8217;ll go to another church so maybe you&#8217;ll see fifty churches up there but there&#8217;s only really one or two that are really financially able to maintain.  Then there&#8217;s a lot of these family churches where a guy becomes a pastor and has his family there.  There&#8217;s lots of them--Church of God, Baptist.  There&#8217;s, I think, five different Baptist churches up there, like Missionary, Southern.  I don&#8217;t know them all.  There&#8217;s five, I think, different kinds of Baptist churches.  But church is not a normal thing.  People will always come up to you and say, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to pray about that, we&#8217;ve got to pray about it,&#8221; but they never grace the steps of the church. [Laughs]
DC: [Laughs] Right.
HC: It&#8217;s sort of funny.
DC: This is a good segue I guess.  I wanted to ask you about the difficulty for people to actually ask for help, and I imagine some of these are quite proud people, and what that relationship is like of coming if from the outside.  Obviously you&#8217;ve worked there for a long time now, but do they have suspicion of outsiders, being that there is this tradition of folks coming in from the outside or missionary folks coming in?  What all is in the wind there in terms of those kinds of issues?
HC: First of all most of the people that we work with are on supplemental income or Social Security, so I would say seventy-five percent of the people are on some kind of government subsidy and they depend totally on subsidies.  The rest of them know about the churches and they&#8217;re willing to take anything they can get, any time, any place, anywhere.  They are totally dependent on welfare, and they&#8217;re not afraid to go get it.
DC: Okay.
HC: Now suspicious of outsiders, yes, there&#8217;s some suspicion, although I never felt that people didn&#8217;t trust me.  I mean I&#8217;ve had a good relationship with them because my rule is you never, ever judge who they are and what they&#8217;re doing, [Laughs] and the only reason I say that is if I see drugs being--you know, there&#8217;s drugs in front of me and things, people selling drugs, I look beyond that because my position is to focus on the children.  If you get a reputation of being a tattletale up there you&#8217;ll never see anybody so I have to turn my head, and we&#8217;ve been over in projects--.  We stayed in the projects one summer for two weeks when we ran one of the camps and I&#8217;m talking to people and they&#8217;re passing pills and selling pills in front of me and you just overlook it.
PC: Because the kids, the kids in the area would come, and they had computers where we stayed, and they would come in and talk,--
HC: Yeah, they&#8217;d just come in and stay with us.
PC: --and that was the important for us.
HC: Right.  I mean they stole our air conditioner, the people [there], because they wanted the copper. [Laughs]
DC: Right.
HC: They burnt the playground down when we were there because that&#8217;s one of the things they do up there.  That&#8217;s one way to show revenge is to burn your house down.
DC: I heard about this; a lot of burning going on.
HC: Yeah, they burn you out.
DC: And there&#8217;s no fire--.  Well--.
HC: No fire department, right.
PC: The fire department can&#8217;t begin--
DC: Too far away.
PC: --to get back in the mountains.  And most--I say most of the time, because of I really don&#8217;t know this for a fact--but I think most of the time they know people are not in the home, so it&#8217;s not like they want to kill someone.  It&#8217;s just to make it inconvenient for you.
DC: Right.
HC: The people up there have been so--.  It&#8217;s sad, but for generations people have been enabling them and they&#8217;ve lost sort of an incentive or a will to better themselves.  I&#8217;m not saying that&#8217;s everybody.  I&#8217;m talking about--.  See, unfortunately I work with the bottom tier, but I would say nobody where I work--.  Well that&#8217;s not--.  I know people that do work and I know people that are successful but I&#8217;m not involved with them.  The people I&#8217;m involved with, they have very little chance of change.
DC: So what are your goals for them and what are your goals in working with them?
HC: My goals in the past have been to completely dissociate myself from the family--okay?--and focus on the child, but that&#8217;s not a good answer, so if we have opportunities to remove the children legally, and it&#8217;s in their interest, we try to remove the children from the family.  That&#8217;s an objective.  Now that&#8217;s not the state objective.  The state objective used to be reunification of the family, which it should be, however it shouldn&#8217;t be in most of the situations with drugs, so our position is always to find some place for the children.  Unfortunately there&#8217;s no place for the children because foster care doesn&#8217;t have enough room and the state is resistant to take them away anyway.  What they&#8217;ve been doing in the past is--.  They don&#8217;t call it this anymore, they have another name for it, but it used to be called placement with a relative caregiver, so what they&#8217;ll do is place them with a grandparent, uncle, or aunt, or a neighbor, which is a disaster.  My answer to that question is they need orphanages.  They need places to get these children out of those homes for at least twelve hours a day, five days a week, if possible.  Now an orphanage would get them out twenty-four hours a day, and I think if you look at all the inner city things that have been successful, there are all these seed schools and things that take children out of their environment, put them in a school environment,--
DC: Structure, right.
HC: --and let them go home weekends.  That&#8217;s what we want to do up in the mountains but there&#8217;s nobody who cares about the mountain people.  There&#8217;s no focus on it.  That&#8217;s what we would have done, set up orphanages.  Now I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that if we can take these children and try to educate them as much as possible, not necessarily on the cog--well, cognitive skills, I guess you&#8217;d say--and have them build self esteem, give them some hope, try to regulate their structure so much that they can take crisis, work on that and then try to bring the mothers in, or one of the caregivers.  The problem being is the caregivers--.  The mothers are not the caregivers.  There&#8217;s no real one caregiver for these children, there might be five or six, and they&#8217;re pushed around from home to home during the night, so it&#8217;s very difficult to get a unit back together where you can actually try and bring them back to some kind of relationship where they can relate to each other.  Our position in the daycare is primarily to show them love and nurturing.  The next move I was going to try to do is try get some of these mothers involved, but then I haven&#8217;t been able to track the mothers down because [Laughs] every day somebody--.  You know,--
DC: It&#8217;s someone else.
HC: So it&#8217;s a fractured family.
DC: Do the camps serve a sort of similar purpose, of providing an environment like that?
PC: Right, and what I was going to say when you say, what is your goal, I guess my goal is just to give these kids some hope, and for the camps it gives them a few days of absolute security, which is amazing to watch.  These kids that go down that didn&#8217;t know where they were going to get their next meal, didn&#8217;t know who was going to walk in on them, and here they&#8217;re completely nurtured.  There&#8217;s food, there's love, there&#8217;s excitement, there&#8217;s joy, and to see this for a few days with these kids, it&#8217;s amazing, and when they leave it&#8217;s very sad.  It&#8217;s very sad to take them on the bus going home and they&#8217;re crying because they&#8217;ve had this glimpse into what life could be.  So I guess to take that then and to move it up a little bit and to actually try to find a way for these kids to have this more than just for a weekend.
HC: You really have to move them out of there.  You really have to get them out of that environment, and that&#8217;s maybe a goal in the long term, if there was somebody that would be willing to build an orphanage or a school up in that area, southern Kentucky, northern Tennessee, that would be dedicated to children of a certain income and get them out of there, give them a chance to change, it would help the families because there wouldn&#8217;t be this conflict all the time and it would help the children to separate themselves.  That would be one objective.  It&#8217;s a very expensive objective.  It&#8217;s very unrealistic.
DC: What are the statistics in terms of school completion?
HC: It&#8217;s probably less--.  I would say up in that area thirty-five percent of the people have high school educations.  The drop out rate is probably around forty percent right now.
PC: More men than women.
HC: Maybe more, and the thing is it&#8217;s hard to even tell because I think there&#8217;s a sizeable number of children that aren&#8217;t even in the school statistics.
DC: Right.
HC: They&#8217;re just up there.
DC: And never in the schools.
HC: Never learning.
DC: Right.
PC: Home schooled.
HC: But the other thing, I don&#8217;t want to say there&#8217;s no hope.  I&#8217;m trying to get a mental health--.  See the problem, every case I&#8217;ve had with a girl where she&#8217;s been severely abused sexually the state has put her in custody, they&#8217;ve put her in a situation where there&#8217;s no mental health, what I call real mental health system.  It&#8217;s short term, it&#8217;s not effective, so another area I really want to work on, and I&#8217;m trying to work on this now, is getting mental health up there with video conferencing, because we can&#8217;t get psychiatrists up there.  There&#8217;s a friend of mine who works with Blue Cross/Blue Shield, and we&#8217;ve been up to the hospital to talk to them about putting a video conferencing center up there and using the psychiatrist down here to work the counseling, so that&#8217;s something we&#8217;re working on.  We&#8217;re trying to get the state more aware of the abuse problem and do something about it so we are trying to do things, but the problem is so deep rooted and so severe that it&#8217;s--.  We&#8217;re trying to do little things at a time, I guess, but the focus is on those children.  It&#8217;s still on those children.
DC: And you&#8217;ve got to get to them that young, is what I&#8217;m hearing.
HC: Oh, I think so.  You&#8217;ve got to get them--.  The thing is if you get a child that&#8217;s been in an abusive situation, say seven years later they go into grade school, they don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on around them, really.  Then they get into high school and that&#8217;s when they start dropping out and they become very sexual.  The girls, at thirteen a lot of them are pregnant, and you find there&#8217;s an inordinate number of girls--seven, eight, nine, ten--that are very sexual.  A lot of ministers and I talk about it.  We sit there and say, we&#8217;ve got to be very careful about being around these girls, and it doesn&#8217;t matter what age you are.  They&#8217;re repeating what they see in the homes.  So you&#8217;ve got to try to get them--.  We feel we&#8217;ve got to get them as early as possible.  I wish we could go on to five and six and teach them as much as--I mean older--what they should do and shouldn&#8217;t do.
We always find, I guess, that when they get into high school, they get out of that grammar school in eighth grade and they start going to high school, that&#8217;s when they start--.  Now the girls that are severely abused, I would say they probably never get--.  They might get into high school but I doubt if they&#8217;re capable of getting through it because they have personality disorders and all kinds of situations.  They&#8217;re severely damaged, and there&#8217;s a lot of them.  There&#8217;s an inordinate number.  One year I tracked all of that, and it was like--.  The state didn&#8217;t report but three and I had statistics on nineteen, and I&#8217;m talking about a small area, six thousand people, even less than that.  What I did is when the census came out in 2000 it came out [by zip code] so we started to do statistics by zip code so we could actually target the more severe areas with poverty, because poverty up there is thirty-three percent, the poverty level, and what&#8217;s in the United States--twelve, or ten?
DC: Right.
HC: It&#8217;s three times the average.
DC: I think Sandy Elledge said that there&#8217;s one third below and maybe one third at the poverty line, something like that?
HC: There&#8217;s probably nineteen percent in extreme poverty, one half of whatever the threshold is now.  I don&#8217;t remember.  It&#8217;s twenty-two thousand or twenty-four thousand for a family of four.  That&#8217;s another thing.  Most of the families are single parent.  A couple of men now in my daycare are the caregivers.
DC: Single parents, yeah.
HC: The women have gone on drugs.  As a matter of fact more women are getting affected by methamphetamines than the men.

PC: I was going to say, we see more of that than you do the men.
HC: Yeah.  Men aren&#8217;t doing it.  See I think they&#8217;re doing it to prostitute the women.
DC: Hmm.
HC: That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve seen.  But, anyway. [Laughs]
DC: [Laughs] So, I&#8217;ll use that, I guess, as a segue--
HC: Yeah, it&#8217;s a tough--.
DC: --to this,--
HC: It&#8217;s a tough area, right.
DC: --how tough it is.  I wanted to ask about your own organizational networks but also networks that you use to sustain yourselves in doing this kind of work.  I&#8217;m curious what kind of training you&#8217;ve been able to find for yourselves to do this kind of counseling work and outreach work, but also how you keep yourselves sustained too.
PC: Well, for me it&#8217;s the church.  It&#8217;s the church and the people, the people that we work with.  They sustain me, through what they do and through their prayers and through their concern.  I would say mostly that&#8217;s where it comes from.
HC: I&#8217;m one of the few males up there, first of all, and I work with all women, so when I&#8217;m in the daycare I&#8217;m the only man.  When I&#8217;m in institutions where daycares are brought together I&#8217;m one of the few men, so I&#8217;ve been working with women for ten years, primarily.  The support I guess we get from each other, as Patty says, and I get support from the church, but personally it&#8217;s hard for me because until recently I haven&#8217;t had anybody to--.  See I&#8217;ve been reading, and you asked about who trains me; well I&#8217;m trained by CASA, I&#8217;m trained by the state for specific jobs I do, but when it comes to really understanding, taking the history today and melding it into what&#8217;s going on in psychology and psychiatry and education, I have to do that on my own.  I&#8217;ve sat there and read--.  In the last ten years I must have read twenty books on trauma, so I&#8217;ve sort of become--.  I&#8217;m not an expert on it because I have sense enough to say when I see it I give it to somebody that is an expert.  That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s taught me.  I&#8217;ve learned how to identify a problem and find an expert to address that problem, if I can find one, but that&#8217;s what I--.
DC: I imagine that&#8217;s often difficult.
HC: That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve worked towards so I&#8217;ve studied to do that, to become knowledgeable enough to ask the question, to direct it to the right people, so I&#8217;ve done that on my own.  I don&#8217;t think anybody--.  As a matter of fact I was talking about going back to school to finish some work I&#8217;ve done, research I&#8217;ve done.  But the church has been very supportive financially, which is important to me because I need financial help all the time up there, and secondly I know they&#8217;re praying for me, but I&#8217;ve had to go through some hard--.  I&#8217;ve been through some trauma myself, probably.
DC: I would imagine.  I mean you must.
HC: As a matter of fact I&#8217;ve been through it so I&#8217;ve called up--.  I went to call at Cambridge Hospital in Boston because there&#8217;s a group up there that does a lot of research with secondary trauma to find out if I&#8217;m in secondary trauma, [Laughs] find out about myself, and I think probably I&#8217;ve been in it.  I might be in it now but it&#8217;s sort of insulated me from a lot of hurt you know, so.  But it&#8217;s hard, it&#8217;s hard, especially with the children.  You get with two-year-olds--.  I mean I&#8217;m up there and you attach yourself to them because they&#8217;re so--.  They don&#8217;t have male love.  They don&#8217;t have a man--a lot of them don&#8217;t know what a man is, so that&#8217;s hard.  But you have to learn that you have to--.  I have learned that you can&#8217;t--.  First of all I don&#8217;t try to--.  I&#8217;ve learned that you can&#8217;t make immediate change; you&#8217;ve got to be patient.  You know what I&#8217;m saying?
DC: Right.
HC: You&#8217;ve got to know that the little steps you make are what are important and yeah, maybe someday you&#8217;ll have a big change.  And there has been a big change.  The dormitory&#8217;s brought in all these people to help all these housing issues, so that&#8217;s been positive, and the daycare is positive because you&#8217;re touching sixteen children.  However, that might close in September because of funding that&#8217;s going away, so you&#8217;re always fighting for funds.
DC: Where does the funding come from now?
HC: Well right now it comes from--.  We built it with church money and foundation money, like some of the foundations around gave us some money, but the sponsorship is--.  We charge a hundred dollars a week and nobody up there can afford a hundred dollars a week.  The stimulus money that came out this year, forty-two million, I think, was given to the state of Tennessee for daycares.  They told us last month that the money was going away in September, there&#8217;s no more stimulus money, and the state isn&#8217;t picking up the bill, I guess, so we&#8217;re going to lose more than half our income so there&#8217;s no way we can see of getting that, really.  So we&#8217;ve become dependent on the government [Laughs] for welfare really, like the people, I mean, so we might have to shut down, which I can accept.  I just have to find some way to get these children--find an alternative for them somehow.
I&#8217;m trying to think of any other organizations that have worked.  I mean there&#8217;s a lot of--.  I&#8217;m trying to think what other organizations I&#8217;ve worked with.  I work with CASA, I said, but we don&#8217;t do a very good job of [51:21].  One thing bad about CASA is when we have a case we don&#8217;t sit down and talk about it as a team because of confidentiality, and I&#8217;ve been trying to get them to--.  When I was in hospice one of the values was you sit down every month and go through your cases and release some of your hurt or your anxiety and in CASA they don&#8217;t do that and I&#8217;m trying to get them to think about doing that because a lot of people are carrying a lot of things inside themselves that they can&#8217;t talk about.
DC: Right.
HC: It&#8217;s hard.
DC: Well for serving the clients too, but then for taking care of yourselves.
HC: Right.  That&#8217;s right, so.
PC: And I think that&#8217;s what really has happened in a way to Harry, when he started working with the CASA people and working with these families and seeing what was going on up there, because he probably had not been exposed to some of the things that he had heard and seen up there, and when he was he wasn&#8217;t able to talk about it to anyone.
HC: Yeah.  I couldn&#8217;t talk to her about it.
PC: So he internalized it so much that I think it has taken a toll on him--

DC: Yeah.
PC: --mentally.
HC: Yeah, the--.
PC: So--
DC: The confidentiality rules are that strict?
HC: Yeah, they&#8217;re strict, and the schools, see, the schools--.  This is another thing.  Once I started working with abused children the schools started calling me and the principals would call me up.  I don&#8217;t know why they call me because I thought there were social organizations, but there aren&#8217;t.  So they call me up and the principal will call me up and say, &#8220;I have a girl, thirteen, who says she&#8217;s pregnant.  Would you mind talking to her?&#8221;  So I go up there and talk to her, so I get to know a lot of these children prior to going into CASA because I started--.  Every time something happened up there they&#8217;d call me about it.  It got to the point where everybody was calling me from every [Laughs] corner of the county.
DC: So they know you.
HC: They know I&#8217;m going to try to do something about it.
DC: Right.
HC: When it comes to abuse they know--.  See a lot of teachers--and by law they&#8217;re supposed to call in cases when they see abuse.  For some reason a lot of people up there--.  Well I know why some are afraid, because their house will get burnt down, so I have to call the cases in and then I have to fight with the department of children&#8217;s services who&#8217;ll do an investigation because they're biased and they go up there and see something and then they call me and say it&#8217;s not a case and I say, &#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221; so I have to sit there and argue with them about the severity of the case.  Sometimes it&#8217;s two or three years I&#8217;m working with these cases to get them into the courts.
DC: They&#8217;re social workers from--
HC: Yeah, they&#8217;re from--
DC: --the state?
HC: --Child Protective Services.
DC: Okay.
HC: They go up there; they&#8217;re probably afraid to go on these back roads they can&#8217;t get out of.  They go in the situation one time, see that person, and of course the person might give them a good answer and they go out of there saying, well, those children aren&#8217;t abused; they&#8217;re in this situation.  Well, over a month&#8217;s period of time you&#8217;re there, you know what&#8217;s going on, and you have to continually call it in, fight it out, negotiate, and you&#8217;re always negotiating to help these children, which is not easy.  That&#8217;s what frustrates you, is that people don&#8217;t react to the situation.  I don&#8217;t know if that makes sense or not.
DC: It does, yeah.
HC: But, yeah, you get tired of it after awhile but, hey, there&#8217;s children that need you so you just got to bear with it.  I mean I have some cases now where--.  I had a case where a girl, the mother had a paramour in her house and the guy was beating her daughter.  She was black and blue and the mother put makeup on her because she was on methamphetamines, so what do I do when I get in court?  I just made sure that that mother and grandmother and that whole family never see that child again.  It happened that two different fathers, two different children, they were good people, for some reason.  Don&#8217;t ask me how they get mixed up with these--but they got the children, so good things happen.  But you see a lot of--.  You talk to a little three-year-old and you know that she&#8217;s--.  She doesn't even know where her mother lives, one.  You can see the trauma in her eyes.  She&#8217;s disassociated herself from everything, and you look there and think what&#8217;s going to happen to her.  Her father&#8217;s a good guy and her stepmother&#8217;s a good woman but are they going to give her the attention she needs, because that kid has been through terrible things.
DC: Right, is she going to get the mental care that she needs.
HC: Oh, yeah, three, four years old.  What&#8217;s it going to do to her?  That&#8217;s the thing you want to have happen, is follow [up], but that&#8217;s something you never see.  That&#8217;s the frustration.
DC: In terms of working within the church, are there ecumenical networks in that area?
HC: No.
DC: No.
HC: No, the churches don&#8217;t work that much together up there--
DC: Cooperatively.
HC: --do they?  I mean the Catholic Church has Crazy Quilt, and they just took that over, Catholic Charities.  They&#8217;re starting to get more active up there, the Catholic Church is.  Then you have the Methodist Church in housing.  The Episcopal Church, we don&#8217;t try to have a presence up there other than individuals doing ministries.  The Baptist Church, they go to foreign countries. [Laughs]
DC: Are there a number of other Episcopal volunteers like yourselves, or are you--?
HC: There are some in other counties but not in Campbell County.
PC: We have a gentleman and a group of men--
HC: In Johnson--
PC: --that come down from Johnson City.
HC: --City, yeah, there&#8217;s a group up there now.  They are very active now up in Appalachia.  And there&#8217;s a group now in Hancock County starting.
PC: Right.
HC: And I&#8217;m going to try to get help to start that up, if I can.  What else is there?  Now if you went into Scott County and asked that question you&#8217;d probably find a different answer, because in Scott County there&#8217;s a group actually that is ecumenical.  I can&#8217;t think of the name of it, but there&#8217;s a group up there that are really good, work together, the Presbyterian Church--.
DC: In Scott County?
HC: In Scott County.  It&#8217;s a completely different atmosphere of organization.  What the heck is the name of that?
PC: [Laughs] I&#8217;m just drawing a blank.
HC: Oh, it&#8217;s a great group.
PC: We went up to see it just two years ago.
HC: Yeah, we went up to see it, and they have like clothing stores.
DC: Okay.
HC: Now Marie Cirillo has a lot of stuff.  She does a lot.  They have Model Valley that works together and they have housing--not housing--a clothing store.  I don&#8217;t know.  There are things, there are people working.  I don&#8217;t know how [Laughs] effective it is.  Marie&#8217;s famous.  She&#8217;s been up there for forty, fifty years.  I mean she&#8217;s been up there forever, but she doesn&#8217;t get involved in the things I get involved in.  She&#8217;s smarter than I am. [Laughs]
DC: [Laughs]
PC: She works with people in a quiet way.
HC: She does work in a different way.
PC: And she&#8217;s very much wanting to--.  She works on the environmental.  She&#8217;s very big on that.
HC: Yeah, she's an environmentalist.
PC: And getting the land back for the people.
HC: Yeah, right.  She&#8217;s good.
PC: And you&#8217;ll find that out.
HC: She&#8217;s a big enabler too, don&#8217;t kid yourself.  She gives a lot of her money up there.  I think every penny she&#8217;s ever had is dumped up in that place.
DC: Right.
HC: She&#8217;s very generous and she helps a lot of people out, but they don&#8217;t respect her at all for it.
DC: Really?
HC: Nah.
DC: The local people.
HC: They take advantage of her.  They treat her just like the government. [Laughs] I mean I&#8217;ve had people that she helps--.  She owns her home; they never pay her rent, and they reason I know them is because I&#8217;ve had to pull their children out of there. [Laughs]
DC: Right.  So you&#8217;re dealing with them at that level.
HC: The truth is that I know very few people in those areas that are normal, healthy living families, so when people say, &#8220;Do you know this person?&#8221; I&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Never heard of them.&#8221;  They&#8217;ll say they have a home; they go to work.  Nope. [Laughs] I don&#8217;t--. [Laughs]
DC: [Laughs] They haven&#8217;t come across your--right.
HC: Those are people I never meet.
DC: Right.
PC: I think--.
HC: That&#8217;s funny--I mean, it&#8217;s not funny, but--.
PC: I&#8217;m just thinking about Marie, who&#8217;s been up there so long and done such wonderful things.  Her gift and Harry&#8217;s gift are two different things as far as people are concerned.  Harry&#8217;s gift is working--.  He can just be with anyone and talk with anyone, and it&#8217;s a little bit harder for her.  It&#8217;s not that she doesn&#8217;t care as much but people don&#8217;t relate to her quite like they can relate to him, but their gifts--.
DC: Why do you think that is, that Harry is able to do that?
HC: I think the one thing people know about me is that I never judge who they are and I respect who they are.  I don&#8217;t care if they&#8217;re the worst person in the world, I still have some respect for their life and they feel that trust in me, I guess.  I mean there&#8217;s some rotten people I work with, believe me. [Laughs] But they trust me and they call me up all the time.  The girls that have been abused, I mean girls that are in the projects down here and are prostitutes, they&#8217;ll call me on the phone and ask me to come over and drag them out and then they&#8217;ll run away.  I&#8217;ve taken Patty over there in the projects and tried to find some of these girls.
PC: Here in Knoxville.
HC: They&#8217;re just not going to be found.  Anyway, they&#8217;ll always contact me just to swear at me or just to release some of their anxiety.  They know they can call me and do that.  That&#8217;s all right.  I don&#8217;t mind that.
PC: [Break in recording] --somebody&#8217;s in need of whatever, she&#8217;s there for them, and they know it.  They have a true love for her, and that&#8217;s her gift.
DC: So that&#8217;s interesting.  So they view her differently than they view Marie.
HC: Oh, yeah, different person.
PC: It&#8217;s just a whole different thing.
DC: Yeah.
PC: And both of them are focused on this very same area.
DC: Of course, right.
PC: The very same area.
HC: But you&#8217;d never know it.
DC: Right.
PC: But the way the people react to them, and I think maybe some of it is that Tonya comes from West Virginia, and I think she comes from--
HC: An abusive situation.
PC: --an abusive situation, so she&#8217;s kind of one of them.  Marie&#8217;s from New York.
DC: Originally, right.
HC: Brooklyn.
PC: Originally, and--
HC: Big brownstone.
PC: --from wealth and very educated, and I think for some reason there is--.
HC: She was a nun.
PC: It&#8217;s just harder for her to relate.
DC: Do people know that she was a nun?  Is that--?
HC: Yeah.
DC: Yeah, so that&#8217;s part of the--.
PC: A long time ago.
DC: Right.
PC: Yeah.
HC: Because see the nuns started all the organizations, the organizations that I&#8217;m in, Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange, Crazy Quilt.
PC: Is that just not fascinating?
DC: It&#8217;s totally fascinating.
HC: I know.  The Model Valley--every organization up there was a Sister Day or a Sister Cirillo or a Sister this.  Some of them are still up there, some of the sisters, like Marie.
PC: Mary Jo.
HC: Mary Jo works for a utility board.
PC: Very active.
HC: She&#8217;s up there.  I [talk to] her all the time.  [So it is interesting.] But they got burned out a few times when they were up there as nuns.  They destroyed all their--.  They were starting a sawmill and people would go in and burn it out on them.
DC: Oh, really?
HC: Ah!  They did awful things to them.
PC: Even though they were trying to help the people.
HC: I met some of them on a Catholic retreat once I was at.  But, I don&#8217;t know.
PC: I guess it&#8217;s just how the people view people and how comfortable they make them feel.
DC: Were you able to do this kind of, probably not volunteering at this level, but to be involved in these kinds of thing earlier in your lives, or is this something that has really sort of--?
HC: I&#8217;ve always done it, like when I was in the Air Force, when I was an enlisted man.  I left college and went into the Air Force and I used to work at a children&#8217;s home in Washington when I was stationed there.  In my companies I always spent a lot of time.  I volunteered in hospice for eight years.  What else did I do?  I was working with the church.  I was always involved in the church.  My grandmother was a very strong Episcopalian and she was like a nun almost because the Sisters of St. Margaret&#8217;s in Boston, she wore their cross, which is very rare.  My grandfather never graced the steps of a church but he was the kind of man that every time somebody came he gave, and I watched him when I was a little child during the Depression and I watched him after I came back, living with him.  The guy never turned anybody down, so I guess it was a great influence on my life.  My father, although he was a military person he was fairly generous and compassionate in a way.  But, I don&#8217;t know.  My whole life has been.
DC: Yeah.
HC: My company; we used to give people benefits like in a unique situation if somebody didn&#8217;t have money for a funeral we&#8217;d give them money for a funeral.  I don&#8217;t know.  It was always part of the structure of the company.  When I left this big corporation, when they sold me off, was when I could do everything.  Of course we used to things in the big corporation and not tell them.  Because it was so big they never knew what we were doing anyway. [Laughs]
PC: I guess my examples were my parents.  They were both very generous, very giving, and they taught by doing.  They showed us that we have this and you&#8217;re supposed to take that and help someone else.  It wasn&#8217;t necessarily something they told us, it was just something they showed us, so it was a huge influence.
DC: Did you grow up in the Episcopal Church also?
PC: I did not.  I grew up in the Presbyterian Church and then I became a Methodist and then I married him and said, okay, [Laughs] I&#8217;ll be an Episcopalian, so, yeah.
HC: I have two brothers that are priests.  They&#8217;re both retired now.
PC: And a son.
DC: And a son.
HC: My son&#8217;s a priest, yeah, one is.  [But] let me tell you, when I go out in the field religion&#8217;s never something I discuss.
DC: So you don&#8217;t identify yourself as an Episcopal volunteer.
PC: [Laughs]
HC: No, no, no, no.  That&#8217;s one of the things--.  I look at myself as an independent family advocate, family/child advocate.  I&#8217;m not associated with a church [Laughs] because I don&#8217;t want to be labeled.  I don&#8217;t like labels.  That&#8217;s one thing I never liked, because I think they bind you down.  You get labeled and you get tied to a church you&#8217;re dead in the water; you&#8217;re going to be structured.  I don&#8217;t believe in structure when you work with poverty.
PC: And some of the churches they told us--I didn&#8217;t know this--but they said that particularly the Methodist Church when the coal mines and everything were going they were an influence up there and they would do and as soon as the coal mines left and things got bad the Methodist Church left.
HC: So did the Presbyterian.
PC: And the people have not forgotten that--
DC: The people remember that, right.
HC: Oh, yeah.
PC: --and so therefore people will ask us, &#8220;What church do you go to?&#8221; and we&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Episcopal,&#8221; and they&#8217;ll go, &#8220;Well what&#8217;s that?&#8221; because it&#8217;s just a word they don&#8217;t know.
HC: They can&#8217;t even say the word.
DC: Right.
HC: They have a hard time with the word.
PC: So it&#8217;s just best not to go there, unless someone asks, and sometimes we will say the Episcopal Church gave money for this.  We certainly give them credit.
HC: Like they built a daycare center.
DC: Right, and are the camps--?
HC: Yeah, Episcopal.
PC: Funded Episcopal.
DC: They&#8217;re funded, but that&#8217;s not--.  Again you don&#8217;t advertise.
PC: No.
HC: We never advertise.
DC: You don&#8217;t explicitly advertise that.
PC: No.
HC: We never tell.  We just say--.  If they say about the daycare I say the church has built it.  I never say the Episcopal Church.  We they need money I say my church will try to do something.  We&#8217;re not trying to convert anybody. [Laughs] Not that we--.  I don&#8217;t think the Church is bad, don&#8217;t get me wrong. [Laughs]
DC: But it&#8217;s just--.
HC: Not an issue.
DC: You&#8217;ve learned that that&#8217;s--
HC: There&#8217;s too many other problems.
DC: --how to do business.
PC: Yeah.  And maybe, getting back to--and I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m going back here--maybe that had something to do with Marie, that the Catholics were just not accepted in that area at all, and maybe that&#8217;s a lingering thing of mistrust, that kind of thing.
HC: But she never throws her religion in.
PC: She does not at all.
HC: She&#8217;s just the opposite.
PC: She never mentions it.
DC: But there&#8217;s also--I was sort of alluding to this before, I guess--there&#8217;s a long tradition of missionaries in Appalachia and people coming in and then leaving again, and so I would imagine that there would be sort of a legacy of this kind of distrust.
HC: The hardest thing up there really is to break this cycle of poverty, and of course that&#8217;s generational poverty.  There&#8217;s all kinds of things written on it.  You read books.  I just finished reading a book by Edmund Freidman on generation to generation.  I don&#8217;t know.  The same thing, you just read the same thing over and over again about people and how they create this poverty, whatever it be.  It can be wealthy people too.  Up there it&#8217;s just all the issues you can think of that affect it.
DC: Right. [Pause] Wow. [Laughs]
HC: [Laughs] Don&#8217;t get depressed.
PC: Sometimes when we go out and we&#8217;ll be talking, and it is, it&#8217;s just very depressing and you see the audience getting to a point where they almost have to switch it off because they don&#8217;t want to hear it anymore.  They just don&#8217;t want to hear it anymore.
HC: It&#8217;s difficult to express joy in a place like that, but yet when I have those children come up--and I tell everybody--those kids come up and run to me and hug me and tell me, like a little child that&#8217;s a foster child said to me, &#8220;I love you,&#8221; and he&#8217;s two years old, I mean, what the heck?  What more reward is there than that?
DC: Right.
HC: So maybe that&#8217;s what insulates me from it too, those little kids.  And even the ones you help in the [1:11:35], they come up to you and hold you and touch because they know you&#8217;re there for them.  And then the parents even, parents come up.  I was with some parents the other day and they thanked me for what I&#8217;m doing for them, and they&#8217;re druggies. [Laughs] I mean I sat next to this guy and I thought what the heck and I&#8217;m doing sitting with these people, [Laughs] because he&#8217;s rotten to the core but you try to make them know there are people that care about them.
DC: Right.
HC: We&#8217;re not the police.  We&#8217;re not trying to arrest them.
DC: Have you seen people be able to turn themselves around, or would you not even see them at that point?
HC: I probably--.  Have I seen anybody turn themselves around?  No, I wouldn&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve seen anybody.  Have I?
PC: [Laughs]
HC: I don&#8217;t think so.
PC: I&#8217;m thinking.
HC: I&#8217;m trying to think if I can think of anybody that&#8217;s--.  I would say ninety percent of the people I work with have failed, maybe a hundred.  That&#8217;s a bad--.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong.  Maybe some have; I have never seen any.
PC: I think that was something we thought about probably just this year or the end of last year.  We were just talking and we said we&#8217;ve been up there ten to twelve years and instead of having more and more stories of success it seems like--and I think this is really basically because of drugs.  We see more and more people going down this other path.  So it isn&#8217;t a story of success, very few success stories.
HC: It is, and we talked about--.  Like this minister who&#8217;s left and gone down to Alabama, one camp we were talking about this girl, she&#8217;s very sexual, she was ten, eleven at the time, we were concerned about her, concerned about where she came from.  Her brother was very angry; he&#8217;d probably been beat by his father.  Anyway, she just had a baby at fourteen.  She&#8217;s in the high school across the street from me.  She lives up from where our daycare is and she has a little baby now.  I mean, when you think about--.
PC: And she came to the camps, she was just one of these really--
HC: Oh, sweet kid.
PC: --cute girls.
HC: Cute little girl.
DC: Right.
HC: Four years she came to camp.
PC: But because of her family situation where the mother and father let her just go.
HC: He was an alcoholic, the father, and the mother was.
PC: And therefore here&#8217;s this girl right back in the cycle.
HC: Yeah, and her brother was a very intelligent young man, really smart, and what does he do?  He pulls a knife in school and gets out of high school, and he&#8217;s a smart kid, he really was.
PC: Sweet child.
HC: He just became so violent.  He was; he was a nice boy.  Maybe we&#8217;ll see some in the next few years coming out of high school.  There might be some of the children we worked with, but now they&#8217;re into high school, a lot of them.  We were with them ten years ago, when they were five, six, seven, eight, but I can&#8217;t think of any that have graduated since we--. [Laughs]
PC: Well I got--.
DC: But you keep going.  I mean that&#8217;s the--.
PC: Have you talked to Wanda Perkins?
HC: Oh, I&#8217;m not--.
PC: Did you talk to Wanda Perkins?  Is she one of those [1:14:52]?
DC: I called and left a message.  I think I talked to her daughter, or maybe it was her pretending?
HC: No, that would be her daughter.
DC: [Laughs] That was her daughter.
PC: She has a daughter, Leanne.
DC: Okay.
HC: She&#8217;s a great mountain person.
DC: Yeah, I tried to get a hold of her yesterday so I can try again today.
HC: She&#8217;s on boards with me now.  She&#8217;s head of the board of this daycare.
PC: But the point I was going to make with Wanda is she has a niece--
HC: Oh, yeah.
PC: --that came to live with her, Angela, and we got to know Angela when she was a very young girl, and her mother--.  She was taking care of a dying mother and she was like in the third grade.
HC: Yeah, she [1:15:27]
PC: And her father didn't have anything to do with her.  Wanda took her into her home, and this girl is a true success story.
HC: Yeah, she is.
PC: She is in nursing school.
HC: Yeah, she&#8217;s going to Lincoln.
PC: She made it through high school, she was the top of her class, she was president, and she did it on her own.
HC: Yeah, she did it on her own.
PC: She had something in her that no one could give her.
DC: Right.
PC: But her aunt did give her support.
DC: But then she had--.
HC: Her aunt gave her security, gave her a home and security.
PC: Gave her the security--
DC: Nurtured her, right.
HC: Love.
PC: --and let her know that she was special and she could do anything she wanted to.
HC: She&#8217;s going to LMU to get her nursing degree.
PC: So she would be our success story.
HC: We didn&#8217;t have a lot to do with it though.  Maybe we helped--.  We helped out with clothing and things and we were around her.  I still see her.  She has a boyfriend next door to our school.
PC: Anyway.
HC: Anyway, there&#8217;s one.  We&#8217;ll find some.
DC: [Laughs]
PC: If you just keep talking, there they are.
HC: I tell you what, I see successes every day now because I see children talk that used to stutter, that can actually talk now in sentences.  I see a lot of change.  I&#8217;m starting to see--.  I&#8217;m lucky; I&#8217;m with a creative age, two- to three-year-olds.  Their brains are growing like crazy, so I can see these little brains and I guess I see success every day now.  It&#8217;s small but it&#8217;s important.
DC: Right.
HC: Anyway.
DC: Thank you.
PC: You&#8217;re welcome.
DC: Is there anything that I didn&#8217;t ask that I should have asked or anything that you want to add?
HC: No.  I just think that the area, it&#8217;s a very sick area of the United States and I think it&#8217;s evidenced by the television, yesterday&#8217;s, tells us how sick it is.  When a county like that becomes the fourth highest county in violent crimes it&#8217;s a sad statement.  It&#8217;s even greater than Knoxville, Tennessee, [or] a lot of the big cities.
DC: Right.
HC: It&#8217;s gone downhill because of drugs and I think the other thing is the people in the county have been irresponsible, but don&#8217;t repeat that in public.
DC: [Laughs]
PC: [Laughs]
HC: [Laughs] They really are.  They haven&#8217;t taken any responsibility for it.  There&#8217;s a lot of people moving there that are wealthy retirees, going along the lake, and they&#8217;re sitting down there--.  There are some people doing a lot of work, some of the work, but they&#8217;re not getting involved in the real problems.
PC: One of the big problems is the mountain right there because Jellico, Jacksboro, and La Follette are all here and then there&#8217;s the mountain--
HC: And you&#8217;ll see that when you go up there.
PC: --and then there&#8217;s the rest of the people, the northern part of the people.
HC: They should be part of Kentucky really.
PC: Yeah, so that really is a hindrance for getting any help up to that part.
DC: And [also out here] the people just sort of not see it.
PC: They don&#8217;t see.
HC: It&#8217;s like the people in New York that don&#8217;t want to--the inner city; they don&#8217;t want to know about it.
DC: Yeah.
PC: So that has been a huge problem, and the distrust between the two peoples.
DC: Yeah.
PC: [Laughs] It&#8217;s crazy.
DC: Which is probably generations of distrust.
PC: Oh, sure, exactly.  All righty.
DC: Thank you very much.
HC: If there&#8217;s anything you need, if you get back and there are some things you want to ask, after talking to Marie, we&#8217;ll be glad to do whatever we can.  If I have any things you want, statistics, I could send--.
