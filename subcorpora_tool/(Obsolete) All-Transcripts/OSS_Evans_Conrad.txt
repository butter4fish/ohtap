 Sherman, and today is March 17, 2010. I   m here in  the Bennett Room of the OSU Library visiting with Mr. Conrad Evans.  This interview is part of the O-STATE Stories project of the Oklahoma  Oral History Research Program. Mr. Evans, thank you for being here  with us today.  My pleasure.  Let us begin by discussing your background. Could you tell us where  you grew up, when were you born?  I was born in 1927, January the sixth, wintertime, north-central  Oklahoma, eighteen miles north and ten west of Enid, Oklahoma, in a  small town called Nash, Oklahoma. Out on a red dirt farm.  What kind of crops and animals did the farm raise?  Well, back in that time, our crops were a little bit different than they are  now. We were a little bit more of a diversified agriculture. We had corn,  various types of sorghum crops, milo, hay crops, wheat, barley, oats, and  milk cows, beef cattle, sheep, hogs, chickens.  What were your chores on the farm?  Tend all those crops, plant them, harvest, take care of the livestock, do  the milking. That was basically it. And it was year round, it wasn   t  particularly any lag time during the year.  Was your land part of the Run? Was your farm original homestead?  My grandfather made the Run, but where I grew up the land that was  land that he acquired during the Run, but I did not grow up on a  5  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  homestead.  Did he share any stories of the Run with you that you can recall?  Oh, yes.  What were they?  Well, when they came in, of course, they knew approximately where  they were going and located a certain type of terrain. He did not want  flat land for some reason. He preferred rolling country. Where he staked  his homestead, in fact, it was a little more rolling than (laughs) he really  wanted, but you didn   t hunt around, and he was in a little bit of a hurry  to claim land because there were people who were claiming land. So that  was the criteria. Then, he acquired other land as homesteaders moved to  other places or chose not to do what was required to improve on the land  that they had claimed.  So was he a Sooner?  No, no, he was not a Sooner. He came in from Kansas and he was not  too kindly to Sooners, in fact.  Really?  Yes. He didn   t like the idea that they had come in and set up and were  able to claim the better land.  Now was this land in the Cherokee Strip, or     In the Cherokee Strip.  So he made the big Run, the one where the famous photos are, the movie  scenes.  Yes.  Now, so your dad inherited that land?  Yes.  And, now is that current land still within the family?  It was until about ten months ago. We sold it.  Was your farm a Centennial farm then? Did it reach that designation?  6  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Hundred years?  Yes.  Not under my dad   s ownership, no.  You grew up during the Depression era     That   s right.  What can you recall about that time?  I can recall how poor people were, and they helped each other. My  neighbor, I remember vividly, he did not have seed to plant his crops,  and my dad furnished him seed at no cost. He borrowed machinery from  my dad to put the crop in, and had a fairly good crop. Of course, it  wasn   t worth anything. But my dad, he did have a truck. My dad had  some fat steers that he wanted to take to Oklahoma City. He figured he  could get more money out of them there. Our neighbor insisted that he  haul those steers to Oklahoma City. Well, as it turned out, he had several  tire blowouts, my dad had to buy the tires, and buy the meals, which cut  into the profit that he might get on the steers. I don   t remember the exact  price, but compared to today, it would be a giveaway.  Are there any other stories from that era that you can recall?  I remember very clearly the Dust Bowl days, too. They and the  Depression came close together. I remember coming home from school;  I went to a country school that was a mile south of us, and there were no  roads. There had been a road on the west side of our place, but it   d been  closed for many years, so you had to go across the fields and so forth.  The dust was so thick and the vision was curtailed to the extent that I  couldn   t see far enough ahead of me that I couldn   t see where the house  was. I was coming across a wheat field, but fortunately I came to a grove  of trees that I recognized and that was close to the house, so I did find  the house. So that   s what I remember mostly was the dust storms and  how dry it was, and hot, also. At night, in the summertime, you could  hear the chickens breathing in the chicken house, which was quite a  ways north of the house. But it was intensely hot, no green vegetation.  My dad thought the chickens would enjoy some green alfalfa hay, dried  hay, baled. He brought a bale to the chicken pen and put it out there and  wet it down thinking that they would choose to eat that greenery. What  they chose to do was sit on it. (Laughter)  That   s how hot it was.  7  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  That   s how hot it was. (Laughs)  What kind of precautions did you take during the dust storms? Did you  cover your faces?  No, we were far enough to the east of the Dust Bowl, the really intense  Dust Bowl area, that we didn   t do that, but we did hang wet cloths and  so forth over windows, and we took cloth and plugged every crack  because the houses back then did not have insulation in the walls, or in  the attic. And that dust would sift in everywhere. You could write on the  floor quite often. The only way to get that up, we didn   t have electricity  or running water, or anything, was to sweep it with a corn broom, and  that fine dust was kind of hard to really sweep up.  Do you remember Black Sunday at all?  No, really I don   t. I   m aware of it, but, as I said, we were far enough to  the east of the dust, out of the Panhandle and so forth, but a lot of it  came in. We could see these dark clouds rolling in, and the time that I   m  speaking of, when I   m coming home from school, it was dark enough  that the chickens went to roost. So that   s all I remember.  I always ask this question to former farm kids, myself being one: what  was the first tractor that you drove?  The first tractor that I drove was a Model L Case. Now the first tractor  that I remember was a cross motored Case. My dad had one. Ever since I  can remember he had a tractor, and most of the farmers around were still  using horses. And we too, we didn   t use a tractor for everything. We  planted our row crops, we cultivated our row crops with horses, and did  a lot of the plowing of small areas with horses. We used the tractor only  on the larger fields, to plow and to disc and harrow and plant the crops  such as wheat and oats, primarily.  Did you have any harvesters?  Yes. We had a combine and a binder. Certain crops like oats we always  bound, because oat straw was prized for bedding and even eating. Cows  would eat oat straw, they didn   t like wheat straw.  How many head of cows for the dairy operations?  We   d hand milk about thirty cows.  Did you sell the milk, or did you use it for private     8  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  We sold the milk, and well, I say we sold the milk, we separated it and  sold cream, and used the separated milk to feed calves and hogs. We  always had quite a number of hogs that we sold. And calves, our dairy  herd was not dairy cattle, per say, so a lot of the calves went into the  feedlot. I say feedlot, we fed them out as fat calves and sold them.  Where would you sell them?  At Enid, which was twenty-eight miles away. They had a sale barn, and  there were cattle dealers who came through the country buying cattle,  and you could sell quite often right there on the farm.  What about the cream from the milk?  We took that to town, a local produce buyer in town. I remember as a  kid watching them test it for butterfat, and putting what they called the  red reader in the top of the test tube to make a straight line.  Is that the Babcock Test?  It could   ve been. I don   t recall the name of the test.  Did your mother have a garden?  Oh yes, and not my mother, my dad.  Your dad?  And all of us kids (laughs) participated in that garden. He was an  excellent gardener, and raised a lot of garden stuff. We also had an  orchard, and my mother always canned over a thousand quarts of fruits  and vegetables.  Oh, wow.  We had a large cellar, concrete cellar, still there today, and that was the  store house. We cured meats and the canned goods, and potatoes and  onions all went in that cellar.  Was this for family consumption? Or did you sell     Family consumption.  So, you really didn   t have, quote un-quote, a hard time during the  Depression?  9  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Oh lands, no. We didn   t have any money, per say, but we certainly     You weren   t hungry?  No, no, no. We were not hungry. (Laughter) Not at all.  What was your favorite dish that your mother prepared?  She prepared wonderful biscuits and pancakes and homemade bread.  She was just a good country cook. Nobody produced better homemade  bread than my mother. Of course, you like what you grew up with.  That   s right.  And that   s what you remember most, is what you grew up with. But she  was a good cook, and I know in the fall when we would butcher hogs  and cure meat, there were certain parts of the hog that we did not cure.  That would be tenderloin and backbone. For breakfast following the day  of butchering, we would have heart, liver, tenderloin, biscuits, gravy.  (Laughter)  So you were fed well.  All of those high cholesterol, high calorie  items  that wouldn   t fit  Michelle Obama   s obesity program. (Laughter)  Did you participate in 4-H at all?  I guess it was about two years I did, and I had some purebred sheep, and  a man that worked at the local bank sponsored me for that project, but  that was my last two years in high school, and that   s all I participated.  Did you ever come to Stillwater for the Roundup?  No, no. That was too far away.  Did you show in the fair?  Yes, I showed a Hereford bull in the fair one time   Pond Creek,  Oklahoma.  What was that experience like?  The best experience was getting to know the bull. (Laughter) We raised  him right there on the farm, and he was from some registered stock that  we had. He placed second at the fair, and that was the main thing,  10  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  preparing him   showing him was not particularly spectacular.  Did you sell the bull at the fair?  No, no, we kept him.  How often would you go to town?  Mainly on Saturdays.  To do shopping?  Yes. Do shopping, and often times stayed in town because, to stimulate  people coming to town, the local merchants would have programs and  during the summer there was always an outdoor movie that you could  attend, and ordinarily they were of the western type: Custer   s Last  Stand, The Last of the Mohicans, and things like that.  Did you enjoy those movies?  Oh, yes, oh yes. Being a youngster, that was very exciting because you  got to meet other kids, and get into some kind of orneriness. (Laughter)  That   s true. Where did you go to high school?  Nash, Oklahoma.  How many were in your graduating class?  Seven.  (Laughs) Seven. Okay     And the reason for that was because WWII took a lot of our     I was going to ask about that, getting into that. Do you remember the  start of the war? Do you remember where you were when you heard  about Pearl Harbor?  We didn   t have a radio, having no electricity out on the farm. Didn   t  have a radio, so I heard about it the following day at school. We listened  to Roosevelt   s, I guess you   d say, Declaration of War.  His Day of Infamy Speech?  Yes.  11  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  What was the mood of that time period? Were you scared or  apprehensive, nervous?  No, really not. The students there in the high school, of course, there was  comment on how terrible it was and so forth. I   m sure there was some  derogatory remarks made about the Japanese, but no, there was no real  fear.  How did the war transform the rural farming community where you  were?  I can   t say that it transformed it at all. There were many things that took  place as they instituted the draft. There were certain farmers who were  able to get deferments for some of their sons, especially, I forget what  they called it. But they were needed, and the draft board decided those  issues.  That   s the way my grandpa was, he didn   t get drafted because he ran the  farm.  Yes.  Because his father passed in    39, therefore he was still needed on the  farm to run the operation.  Same way in our community. I   m assuming in every agricultural  community it was very much the same. Oddly enough, you would think  there would be animosity that some got deferred and some didn   t. There  wasn   t that. It was considered to be an honest need.  Do you remember the rationing at all?  Oh, yes. I remember that, shoes were rationed, and my dad had a big roll  of tanned leather. We had, and I still have, my grandfather   s, and maybe  it   s my great-grandfather   s, Shoelast, and our shoes were re-soled. My  dad was pretty good at putting a new sole on a pair of shoes. (Laughter)  And I took that Shoelast to Ethiopia with me and I did a lot of shoe  resoling there.  Quickly, before we get into the OSU Ethiopia portion, can you discuss  your life at Phillips University which is no longer in Enid.  That   s true. One of the reasons I went there was it was close by, and my  sister was going to school there, also. She was older than me. It was a  theology school, but it was very highly rated in science and education,  and I didn   t really know what I wanted to do. I went there two different  12  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  times, before the war and after the war. The first time was science, the  second time was to be certified in education as a public school teacher.  But it was an excellent school. Small school, very friendly. I have very  high regard for Phillips University.  Did you serve in the war?  Yes, I was in the Navy. Naval Air Corps.  Do you want to discuss that?  No, the way I refer to my time in the service, I was a taxpayer   s liability.  (Laughter)  How so?  I never saw any action in a war zone is the reason. I was going through  the process of becoming a naval pilot, and the war ended, and they gave  me the option to go ahead in the Air Corps and serve, I believe it was  four years after I received my commission, and I didn   t. I was not a  military person, because I   d previously turned down an appointment to  Annapolis. I chose to get out of the Air Corps, go into the regular navy  and be discharged on the points system. It didn   t take a long time.  Between my Naval Air Corps training and my discharge I was still in the  Naval Air Corps, what they called the Naval Air Transport System. We  would move planes from various and sundry places, but always in the  American theater. And that included from Iceland back to the US, the  Caribbean, that   s the area that I served in.  Okay.  But nothing spectacular, no.  I was just curious about that. So you came back and you got your BS in  education from Phillips, right?  Yes.  And you came to OSU, or     No. I first went to Phillips, and then I went into the Navy. While I was in  the Navy I attended Central College at Fayette, Missouri, and I attended  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute at Troy, New York.  Which is a very good school.  13  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Yes. Excellent school. Excellent school. I got out of the Navy, I came  back, and I went to OU  University of Oklahoma .  Okay.  I didn   t stay there long because my farm background didn   t (laughter)  conform to OU at that time. I have a high regard for OU, by the way.  Alright.  Then I came back to Phillips, and then I came back to OSU and got my  undergraduate degree.  You finished your undergrad here?  Yes. Then, I went into farming. And then I went back to Phillips to get  an education certificate, which I did. I taught public school at  Hennessey, Oklahoma prior to going overseas. And during that last  attendance, well, I need to fill in some gaps.  Alright, please do.  I was farming with my dad and my brother, and we were heavily in debt,  because we bought all new machinery, and we were farming about 2,000  acres. We needed some cash, so my brother and I worked on  construction. The Union Equity elevators at Enid, we helped build those.  At night, a twelve hour shift. Farmed in the daytime.  Did you ever sleep?  Hardly. Hardly. We increased the size of our livestock operation. We  had a feedlot, and we   d leave work, feed the livestock, my dad did a lot  of it. We   d haul silage from four miles away to feed 400 head of steers.  Yes, it was hectic, and during that construction I met the lady that  became my wife, and I went back to school. I don   t know why I did that,  really. It was kind of a hedge, if the farming didn   t turn out, then I would  be a public     Like fall back on it?  Yes. Then that phase ended and another phase took over.  So what did you teach in Hennessey?  I taught science courses, agricultural courses, mathematics, and that was  at the sixth, seventh and eighth grade level.  14  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  How did you become involved at OSU after you got your degree? How  did you actually land a position here?  Well, that was, after I got my undergraduate degree, I went into  agriculture. Then, when I came back to OSU, that   s a story all in its  own. While I was teaching at Hennessey, a faculty friend of mine, Hugh  Rouk, went on the Ethiopia program. I didn   t necessarily know that he  had, but a friend of mine called and said,    Hugh Rouk is going to be in  town, why don   t we take him out to dinner?    And we did, we arranged  for a group of former students of his to have dinner at the Student Union,  and as a result of that dinner meeting, I asked him how he happened to  wind up in Ethiopia. Well, he said,    Are you interested in hearing the  story?    I said,    Yes.    He said,    Why don   t you stay after the dinner   s  over and we   ll talk.    So we did, and he asked me if I was interested.  That was my entry back into OSU, because he   d came, he and another,  Bill Abbot, came to my house and my wife and I had invited them to  dinner. They asked us if we wanted to go to Ethiopia. So that was my  entry back into OSU.  This was 1957 or    58?  It was in 1956.  What was your wife   s reaction when you told her,    Hey, I   m thinking  about going to Ethiopia,   ?  She was pre-warned, I guess you would say, for reasons I can   t explain.  We were engaged to be married, I was going to school at Phillips, and  we were sitting on the golf course one evening and she said,    What are  we going to do after we get married?    And I said,    Oh, I don   t know.  How would you like to go to Ethiopia?    Now, that was out of the clear  blue sky. (Laughter) And she said,    Oh, my mother wouldn   t allow  that.    I said,    I   m not marrying your mother.    (Laughter)  But I need to give you some background on that, too. When WWII was  actually taking place, the background for it was taking place in Europe,  my dad was an avid follower of what was happening. One of the things  that really, really bothered him was the Italian invasion of Ethiopia. We  subscribed to the Wichita Beacon, and they had some very vivid pictures  of Ethiopian people, armed only with spears, throwing those at tanks.  That bothered him that somebody was invading a country with that  much of a military imbalance. He also read stories about the gassing of  people, the poisoning of water, and that really upset him. That whetted  my desire to know more about that. I read everything I could about that  Ethiopian invasion. I was well grounded. I knew more about Ethiopian  history at that time than I did Oklahoma history. (Laughs) I suppose, as a  15  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  kid, being introduced to that is what caused me to say,    How would you  like to go to Ethiopia?    Because I had not met anybody from OSU, I was  not even aware of the program taking place, really.  Sort of predestination?  I guess you   d call it that, yes. My dad   s interest in Ethiopia and, I don   t  know  but  that   s the way it happened.  So you left in 1956, right?  That   s right.  Can you explain the reaction from some of your relatives?  Some of them thought I was crazy. Most of them didn   t even know  where Ethiopia is. My parents were very supportive of it. That meant  that I was stepping out of the agricultural scene with my dad and my  brother. But my brothers and sisters were very, very much for it. My  parents had always encouraged their children to be adventurous, and to  think for themselves, and I have raised my kids to be the same way. So  although they hated to see us go, they shed a few tears, but     Did you have children at that time?  No.  So that made it easier.  That made it easier. Yes.  You were in Ethiopia, 1956-1968?  That   s true.  And you were the longest serving person over there?  Of a continuous term. Hugh Rouk possibly was there more time-wise,  really he wasn   t, because after the program was over I administered a  World Bank program in Ethiopia for OSU and spent a lot of time in  Ethiopia.  Seeing as how we   re sitting in the Dr. Henry G. Bennett Room, were you  aware of Dr. Bennett   s vision and mission of the Point Four program?  In fact, that   s another story in itself. I knew Henry G. Bennett quite well  16  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  as an undergraduate here. And (laughs) I was laying on the lawn on the  south side of Whitehurst Hall over here, and somebody said,    It   s a  beautiful day, isn   t it?    and I said,    Yes it is.    I didn   t turn around to see  who was talking. And he said,    Are you waiting for class?    I said,    No,  I   m waiting for a friend to get out of class. We   re going fishing.    We  were, and we were skipping a class to go fishing. And he said,    You got  an extra pole?    I turned around then, and it was Henry G. Bennett  standing there. After that, every time I   d see him he   d stop me and ask  me if I   d been fishing lately, and we struck up an acquaintance. I knew  Henry G., I felt comfortable talking to him. And that was my only  acquaintance, was just to stop, and he was always interested in what you  were studying, how you liked school, and specifically how you liked  Oklahoma A M. He   d always ask you that,    How do you like  Oklahoma A M?    If he suspected that there was something you didn   t  like, he would lead you to describe what you didn   t like. He was very  much a student oriented person, as was his successor, Dr. Willham.  What kind of esteem did students have for Dr. Bennett?  To the best of my knowledge, a very high esteem for him. Very much  so. He was very much liked by students because he was receptive to  students. He would mix with students, he would come down the hall of  Whitehurst, and there were a lot of classes held up in the upper stories of  Whitehurst, a lot of Ag courses, and he   d stop students and talk to them  about,    What class did you get out of?       How   d you like it?       Are you  learning anything?    That was one of his things,    Are you learning  anything?    (Laughs) No, students respected him very much.  How did you hear about his death? Do you recall at all?  Yes, I recall. I think I read it in the newspaper, really.  And do you remember     I really don   t remember, Jacob, how I heard about it, but I just remember  hearing about it.  What do you think about Dr. Bennett   s mission about foreign higher  education?  I think it   s absolutely essential. He was on the right path, I think.  Following our tenure in Ethiopia, I think we withdrew from that vision a  bit, and I think Henry G. would have objected to our reduced vision. In  other words we kind of withdrew inward. Now, I think Henry G.  would   ve pushed for even greater participation in international, because  that was his vision was that educational institutions needed to be  17  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  involved if they were going to be a complete institution. They had to be  involved in the world.  Who arranged for you to go to Ethiopia, and what kind of process was  that like?  Bill Abbott, who was, I couldn   t name the title of the office at that time,  was the one that was in charge of the personnel that went to Ethiopia.  You made all of the arrangements through his office. That office later  became the Office of International Programs. But it had an evolutionary  process through several different titles.  Where were you assigned to live and work in Ethiopia?  At Jimma, Ethiopia where it all began, by the way. It was an old Italian,  Catholic mission school that we rebuilt and used.  Did you live there the entire time?  No, I lived there eight years and then transferred to the, which we called  the College of Agriculture, because it was part of Haile Selassie I  University. It was the College of Agriculture of Haile Selassie I  University, which was located in Addis Ababa, the capital.  What were your living conditions like?  At Jimma, as I said, we lived in rebuilt houses built originally by the  Italian mission group that established that school. I have no criticism of  them. They were different than what we have here, we have mostly  wood construction. Those houses were full masonry. They had no wood  except in the roof. You didn   t hunt for a stud to drive a nail into to hang  a picture on. But it was good housing.  Were they heated?  No. We had electricity, and you could get an electric space heater, small,  of course. That was our only source. Growing up on the farm, where we  had no electricity, we used wood heating stoves. I found a wood cook  stove in a storeroom there in the school. I put it in my kitchen and I used  wood to fuel it. That was enough heat to supply the whole house.  What was the weather like there?  Don   t get me started.  Uh-oh.  18  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  No, it was the most wonderful climate. I   ve always said that the United  States should make Ethiopia a state of the United States just for a  vacation spot. It   s wonderful climate. During the daytime it would get,  maybe up to eighty degrees, a little over, maybe, but not too often, and  at night it would drop down into the 40s. Early in the day you wanted a  light jacket. It was wonderful.  Was it the same climate year round?  Yes. And they called it summer and winter, but their differentiation was  based on rainfall, not so much on temperature. There was actually the  dry season and the wet season.  What were your responsibilities for your job? Like, what did you  actually do there?  (Laughs) My contract stated not specifically, per say, but I was hired to  do what nobody else wanted to do or could do. It was that, it was, it  encompassed 180 degrees.  So everything from grunt work to paper pushing?  That   s right, that   s right. I was in charge of maintenance. That was  buildings, roads, water supply, electrical supply, shipping, receiving, and  classroom teaching.  What work did you enjoy the most?  All of it.  All of it?  All of it.  Who did you work with? Did you work for the entire university, so you  knew everyone there?  Yes. At Jimma, yes, it was a very close relationship. Even with the  students because they were confined to the campus and were to leave the  campus only with a faculty member. And that was partly precipitated by  the fact that when the school first opened and the students were  furnished clothing, they all wore the same type of clothing and they were  identified as a privileged group by the local people. If they went outside  there was some danger that they might be roughed up a bit. So to prevent  that faculty members went with them. We went to the movies, wherever  they went outside of the campus. But that soon wore off and it was not a  19  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  problem, but still we supervised their movements off campus.  What parts of your assignment were the most difficult for you?  Probably maintaining a water system because we chose to develop a  deep well system, and our wells were five to six hundred feet deep.  Maintaining the pumps was a constant problem because we served quite  a number of people, the dormitories and the staff houses, with a potable  water supply.  What did your wife do during this time? Did she work?  (Laughs) She had four children.  That would do it. (Laughter) That kept her busy.  Yes, she did work. Secretarial work, library work, things like that. We  had   child raising was not as difficult there as it is here, really, because  we had very competent local, what would you say     Nannies? Or caretakers?  Yes. Caretakers, we had very good in the home work maid service,  gardeners. Things like that.  Were you guys treated as, I hate to say the word, elite, or privileged?  How did the local population view Americans there?  There may have been some of that, Jacob, but we were encouraged (and  most of the people did it on their own)  to be  involved themselves with  local people, local causes. Like, my wife, when we first went there, she  worked with the governor   s wife to produce clothing for an orphanage  that the governor   s wife was operating there in the town. That way you  got to be recognized as doing something for the local people, also. In my  work I also assisted with the extension work, like poultry to farmers  outside, farming methods and things like that. The acceptance of  selected varieties of corn and grains and so forth. So when they realized  that you were working with them and not they working for you, and we  didn   t want to portray that at all, and didn   t, yes we were accepted.  After you were gone awhile, what were  your family members     thoughts  of this    adventure,    as I would call it? Did they like you still being over  in Ethiopia?  We stayed in Ethiopia two years at a time before coming on home leave,  and we had very generous allotments of home leave. I don   t know how  20  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  they figured that at all, but I never felt that we were deprived of time  when we came on home leave. And my parents, being knowledgeable of  where we were, my father especially was very interested because of his  deep concern about a European power invading Ethiopia during World  War II. That carried over to what we were doing over there and he was  very interested in what was going on, how we were trying to improve  agriculture and agriculture education and so forth. His interest and  consequently also my mother   s interest, although they said that they  missed us, and especially our children, that was their grandkids that they  were deprived of seeing them, but as I said, they were very supportive.  They saw it as a necessary need for the United States to be involved in  such things. And consequently we did, we felt very good about the  attitude of my family.  Now my wife   s, she was an only child, and her mother had some health  problems that we were concerned with. Her dad, being a former  minister, was very encouraging in us participating in this type of work  because he viewed it as missionary work, not necessarily theological,  but in that same vein of concern for other people. Her mother, she didn   t  like for her daughter to be that far away, but they accepted it, she  accepted it, and that was it.  How often would you come back to the States?  As I said, we came back every two years, but finally we were over there  so long that it seemed like all we were doing was going on home leave.  And we finally lengthened that to three years. That was at the end of the  program over there, when it, I believe the last time we were on home  leave with a three year gap, and then we came home and the program  extended then one more year. So, two, three and one.  How long were your lengths of stay when you came back for home  leave?  That   s what I was mentioning earlier, I don   t know how they figured  that, but we were home--well, in the beginning, the first home leave,  something over thirty days.  Oh, so a good month? Six weeks at a time?  Oh, yes.  What time of year did you come back? Was it summer time?  You could pretty well adjust that. Ordinarily it was in the summer time,  because that coincided with the break in school over there.  21  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  How long was the trip back? How long did it take physically from  leaving Addis Ababa     You mean the fastest you could get here, or     Yes. The fastest.  Well, let   s see. You   d fly from Addis Ababa to somewhere in Europe,  most people, either Athens or Rome, and then from there to London, so  it   d take about three days.  Did you happen to visit Europe when you were making the trek back?  Oh, yes.  What did you see? Did you see Athens or Rome, or     All of it.  So you played tourist some.  Yes. And, well, everybody did. We traveled throughout Western Europe.  Not so much Eastern Europe. We did at one time plan a trip to Russia,  but that got cancelled due to political  issues , it was during the Cold  War days. And we traveled through the east also, through Saudi Arabia,  Pakistan, India, Thailand, Philippines, Hong Kong, not mainland China,  Japan.  So you filled up your passport with stamps?  Oh, yes. Absolutely.  How did you manage to keep in touch with your family when you were in  Ethiopia?  By mail entirely. There were telephones, but where we were it was  almost a futile process to try and call internationally. We could use  Telex.  I heard that the mail was actually pretty good, the service was pretty  good because it was connected with Armed Services Mail.  APO. Yes, it was excellent.  So you got a letter within a week or so, basically?  22  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Yes.  That   s good then, because obviously the keeping in contact had a decent  basis.  Oh, yes. If you sent it by regular mail, well, a friend of ours, I don   t  know why she   d do this, but she   d send us a Christmas card every year.  We   d get it in May.  She was thinking it would take that long to get it over? (Laughter) That   s  pretty funny. Did you participate in American traditions, like, did you  celebrate Thanksgiving, Christmas     Oh, yes.  And how was that celebrated? Did you have to make adjustments?  No, not necessarily. As I said, the American staff was a very close unit  because we had to provide our own entertainment if we had, like,  holidays, so forth, but we did. We had Thanksgiving dinners  as a   group, all of us together. We had Christmas celebrations, especially for  the children, and even the students. They wanted to participate in this  also. So we   d have a school-wide Christmas pageant or a play. Even  though some of those students were not of the Christian faith, they  wanted to be there to see it, so we   d have it in an assembly hall. It was  part of the social life of the school. The same way with their holidays.  Did you participate in their holidays, and what kind of celebrations did  they have?  Well you see, their Christmas celebration was not on the same day as  ours, so we participated in theirs. The Christianity part dominated,  although we had students who were of the Islamic faith. I think we  probably did them a disservice by not incorporating their holidays into  our life there at the schools.  Aren   t Ethiopians one of the oldest Christian subgroups?  Oh yes. They are. Yes. I think they are the first to accept Christianity as  a national religion. Of course, that was by decree of an emperor. Most  people don   t realize that, but the Coptic Christian is one of the oldest, if  not the oldest, of the organized Christian religions.  How long did it take for you to feel culturally acclimated to Ethiopia?  (Laughs) Culturally acclimated?  23  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  To rephrase that question, how long did it take for you to feel that  Ethiopia was your home?  It didn   t take me very long. And consequently, it didn   t take my wife  very long, but it was more difficult for her than it was for me, because I  had job responsibilities to take my mind off of other things. At first she  was at the home, working with the servants, maid that we hired to do the  house cleaning, gardener, and that left her with nothing to do. She  needed something to occupy her time, so she was very creative. She  became an excellent gardener of flowers, edibles, and so forth, and she  devoted a lot of her time to that. Then later became a secretary for the  administration, worked in the library, things like that. Of course, as I  said, she bore four sons while we were over there.  Were the births at home?  One of them was. Yes. The other three were in a hospital in the capital  city,  Addis Ababa .  In your opinion, what was the thing that was the most culturally  shocking to Americans that went over?  I think the thing that was most shocking to them was the poverty. The  disparity in what we came from to what we were working in. That was a  shock.  Could you describe this poverty?  Yes. To see children with either no clothing or just a shirt, and no shoes.  In that part of Ethiopia they were not necessarily malnourished. The type  of housing they had, although, as you were there longer you began to  realize that they didn   t need what we had. We had too much. That was a  shock in reverse in a way to realize, and I felt a little bit guilty about our  American consumption weighed against what their level of consumption  was. I think I developed that because I was there longer and lived in it  and developed an appreciation for it. Well, maybe not an appreciation,  Jacob, a concern.  Getting into the food aspect, how did you adjust to Ethiopian food?  I love it.  You love it?  Absolutely. Absolutely. My wife, by the way, is a noted Ethiopian cook.  She has even taught the food services here at OSU how to make  24  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Ethiopian foods.  What do you like about it? Just     I like the taste of it, I like everything about it.  So how often does she still prepare Ethiopian food for you?  Oh, probably once a month. To prepare genuine Ethiopian food requires  a bit more work than our    go to the grocery store and buy prepared  stuff.     Do you ever get down to the City to the Ethiopian restaurant?  Oh, yes. (Laughter) Absolutely. Have you been there?  No, just thinking about it makes me hungry,  Do you like Ethiopian food?  I never had it, so, I   ve had Indian     Well, if you like Indian, yes. The new Indian restaurant out here, I like  that.  Yes. I   ve been there.  And the Thai restaurant down     But one thing that I really haven   t gotten into is Mediterranean. Yes,  I   ve had Greek, but like med-Turkish food, it   s real flavorful. The Middle  Eastern food is real flavorful, and Ethiopian food, I just have not gotten  into that.  Yes.  I want to, believe me, I want to try     Certainly do so.  Besides the food, did you bring back any other Ethiopian customs?  No, not that I could cite, no.  Did you bring back any artwork or statues, or any of that type of thing?  25  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Oh yes. Yes. Our home is kind of an Ethiopian d  cor. (Laughter)  Ethiopia West.  Yes.  How did you document your stay in Ethiopia? Did you take pictures,   keep  diaries, did you have a handheld camera?  Oh, yes, I had a camera, and my son is presently putting all of our slides  and photos on CDs. Yes, I have hundreds if not thousands of photos.  Did you get to travel around the country?  Oh, yes.  Were there mountains?  Oh yes, it   s very mountainous. Very mountainous. And very few roads.  First I took an American made car over, but it didn   t take long to change  my mode of transportation to four wheel drive and get off the road. I had  first a small jeep, and then I had a seven passenger Land Rover, then I  graduated to a ten passenger Land Rover, and I went all over the  country.  Did you like driving the Land Rover?  Oh, yes.  Was that one of your favorite vehicles?  It is one of the best vehicles ever made.  (Laughs) In Ethiopia, did you ever see any remnants of the Italian  invasion?  Absolutely. You   d see old tanks. And the main thing that you saw was  road building equipment; big rollers, steam engine type rollers for  crushing and packing the rock. They built wonderful roads, in the old  Roman manner. They would hand lay a rock base, and then finer and  they   re still there.  I talked to Dr. Webb, and he said that was one of the things that he  would remember was the roads that the Italians left.  Yes, absolutely.  26  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Did you see any exotic animals?  Oh, yes.  Like what kind of animals did you see?  All of them. (Laughs) The majors ones; the buffalo, both the Cape  Buffalo and the Nile, lions, leopards, elephants. You could just run down  the list. All of the Gazelle types, from the Wildebeest, Hartebeest,  Thompson   s Gazelle, the Water Buck, the Greater and Lesser Kudu,  Baboons, Warthogs, Forest Hogs     Ever do any big game hunting when you were there?  Yes, I shot some game, but I shot one Oryx for trophy, I shot a buffalo, I  shot a lion, one lion, I shot two leopards, I shot a Giant Forest Hog,  which is in the museum here. But I didn   t just go out and  shoot , and I  abhorred anybody that did.  Did you happen to travel within the rest of the African continent at that  time?  Yes, I drove also over Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda. Those three especially.  I was in the Sudan, up and down the Nile River in Egypt, but that was  about the extent of it, right there.  Were there border checkpoints? I was just thinking you have so much  open country that they didn   t really have border checkpoints.  (Laughs) Well, you could cross the border if you were an adventurous  type and had a four wheel drive vehicle and had some knowledge about  choosing the terrain and so forth. Yes, I crossed the border. (Laughs)  I got caught one time. I was in the Ogaden area of Ethiopia, that   s in the  Somali section. I was following a range of hills, and I knew that if I went  that way and made a right hand turn I would intersect with a road from  Hargeysa to Jijiga. I went a little bit further than I realized, and the  border made a turn inward there and I crossed into Somali land. When I  turned right and intersected the road and made another right turn to  come into Jijiga, I was actually approaching the checkpoint out of  Somali land, and they stopped me. Well, I crossed this dry gulch called  Tugwijali, over on the other side was the Ethiopian checkpoint. Well,  they were over there motioning and saying,    Come on, come on.    I  realized that I was in the wrong area. And when they blocked the road  first, and as I eased up there they parted. I just shifted gears and down  that dry gulch I went to the Ethiopian side. Then it took me four hours to  27  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  explain to them what I had been doing over there. But I got there.  You made it safely.  Yes.  Did you ever have any contact with the Emperor Haile Selassie?  Yes, I   ve met personally with Haile Selassie and talked to him. It was on  an informal basis. You didn   t do that often, no.  What was he like when you met with him? Describe him for us.  He was a very gracious person. In formal occasions he always spoke  through an interpreter, he didn   t speak English, although he spoke  English. But his major foreign language was French, and he oftentimes  would use French to go to an interpreter to speak back to you in English.  But, in an informal basis he would speak English, and was a very easy  person to be around in that occasion. Yes, I have a lot of respect for  Emperor Haile Selassie.  Were you ever invited to any of his palaces?  Yes.  What were they like?  They   re very, very elegant. (Laughs) Compared to the local peasant,  there   s no comparison.  How did Ethiopians at that time view him?  It depended on where you were. If you were in the Northwest area,  Wollo, Tigray, Begemder, provinces which was the Amhara, and he was  an Amhara, they were a hundred percent behind him. If you got into the  Northern Tigray area, they were actually contenders, historically, for the  throne. Then you had the major population group, the Oromos, who felt  that they had been colonized by an Amhara, King Menelik, and they  were grudgingly supportive.  At that time did you see any undercurrent political movements?  Yes. There were some attempted coups while I was there, and he was  always able to subdue those. So there was an undercurrent, always.  Always. When I first went to Ethiopia, the major road between Asmara  and Addis Ababa was closed due to, we called them shiftas, bandits, but  28  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  it actually was a political movement of insurgents, I guess you would  say. Another guy and I drove two old buses that we were given by the  American military base in Asmara, and we drove those back and for a  certain portion of the way we had to take armed troops with us. It was  quite an experience. That was driving it through that very mountainous  territory, too, around curves that you had to stop and back up to  negotiate the curve. Those long buses wouldn   t make the curve.  Did you see any Marxist movements, or was that underground?  No, I was totally unaware of any Marxist movements at that time. That  happened shortly after we   d terminated the program.  What was the overall American involvement there? You said there was a  military base, and what else, what kind of support did the United States  give Ethiopia at that time?  In Asmara was the major communications base for any American  personnel, like the president. If he traveled outside the United States,  that was the center  for  communications at Asmara. It was the major  listening post to the Soviet Union, so it was a very important base and  very well supported. Although it was not particularly an armed base.  Now, the United States supported the military of Haile Selassie   s  government, and there was often times training groups in the country.  We met many of those but we didn   t think anything about it being the  thing to do.  How did you hear about news from back home?  Primarily by radio, short wave.  Is that how you heard about the Kennedy assassination?  Yes. On the radio.  What was the atmosphere like when that occurred?  (Laughs) Strange to say, but it affected the Ethiopians as much or more  than it did the Americans. Because they had a different perception of  what would happen than we did. We knew that there would be an  orderly transfer of power. They suspected that it was an overthrow of  government, and being allied to the United States the way they were,  they had more to fear if that was the case than we did. So yes, they were  very aware of it, and they were very grieved by it also. They held their  own ceremonies for him.  29  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  I   m pretty sure the Emperor was actually in the funeral procession     He was. Marching right beside Charles de Gaulle.  Yes, that   s right. I just remember the pictures. Did the campus actually  become locked down then, because of this uncertainty     No, no, no, no, no.     of power?  No.  Now, going to 1968, can you tell us what the circumstances were that  led to the withdrawal of Oklahoma State support?  This was always, we were working our way out of a job, that was the  concept from the beginning. However, the OSU administration didn   t  agree fully with the United States Agency for International Development   USAID , which was the federal unit in charge, really. USAID said that  it was time to turn it over to Ethiopians. We didn   t see it that way, for  more than one reason. There was not enough trained personnel to take  over the administration and operation of the academic units. Because  many of our graduates, when they returned, were given administrative  positions in the central government, not back to the academic institution.  We had some concerns there, but the federal concerns prevailed and we  closed it down.  So the federal government provided the funding?  The United States.  Provided the funding instead of the Institution.  It was a joint effort. The US government provided some funds, and the  Ethiopian government provided some funds.  What was the reaction of those who were in Ethiopia of this news at that  time? Were they stunned, saddened?  You mean about Kennedy?  No, about the closure of the     The Ethiopians did not want it terminated. Not at all. We knew who was  in charge   the US government was basically in charge. We didn   t agree  30  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  with them, but we accepted it.  What was your sons    reaction to this?  To the closing?  Yes, but,    We   re going to have to move back to the States.     No, no. Of course , the two oldest ones had formed very deep  friendships with the local children, so much so that those children asked  for transportation to the airport, which was forty-five kilometers away,  to see them off. I get a bit emotional, because it bothered me, too. I  wasn   t ready to leave, I left a lot of things that I intended to do, not for  myself, but projects for the school and the Ethiopians that I worked with  because I enjoyed working with them, Jacob.  Otherwise you wouldn   t have spent all those years there.  But I realize that we couldn   t stay forever. I was asked to stay on by the  Ethiopian government, but I felt that I had some obligation to my  children. If they were going to be US citizens rather than, I called them,     World Citizens,    we needed to get them back here and get them into  the system. I don   t know whether that was the right thing to have done  or not. But we did it that way. And it   s hard to second guess yourself.  But I didn   t look forward to leaving, no.  I understand. You   ve still got that soft spot in your heart for     Oh, yes. I have a multitude of very close Ethiopian friends that were  formed through OSU after the program was over.  That leads me to my next question, so you have maintained relationships  with those that you met from your time in Ethiopia?  Definitely. I get now e-mails from them almost daily, if not weekly, at  least.  Have you assisted with those international students that have come from  Ethiopia since you got back here?  Assisted in what manner?  Like, you   re a person to go to and talk to about     Oh, yes.  31  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans     culturally     Definitely.  Did you learn their language?  Yes.  Are you fluent, or     No. (Laughter) No, not at all. I speak what I call a    truck driver type     language. I can make myself understood, and I can basically understand  what they are trying to say.  Is there a bond with faculty members that you worked with in Ethiopia?  Oh, yes.  What   s that like?  It   s hard to explain. Let me explain it this way. I came back on home  leave and one of my farmer friends, an old farmer in my area, he said,     Are you teaching those savages anything?    And I said,    Yes, Mel, I   m  telling them all about people like you, and what you believe and how  you perceive them.    He didn   t like that too much, and he said,    Well,  can you trust those people?    I said,    Let   s put it this way. If my life was  in danger, I would want them to be within hearing distance because they  would come.    That   s the way I feel.  What did you teach over there? I completely forgot to ask you that.  I taught mathematics at the college level, because the College of  Agriculture was there at that time. I taught mathematics at the  undergraduate level, I taught world history, I taught economic  geography, I taught horticulture, I taught a soils course one time, but that  was what I was supposed to do. If they didn   t have a teacher lined up,  I     You filled in the gap.  I filled in the gap. And often times with very little notice. But I enjoyed  it. I enjoyed it.  And you probably also learned by jumping in.  Oh, yes. Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.  32  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  How did the Ethiopian experience impact your life?  Well, it became my life. Basically, it turned my life to internationalism, I  guess you would say. Had I remained in agriculture I would   ve been  somewhat confined, I guess you would say, to the local community,  state, and nation, and my international experience would   ve been mostly  through hearing and reading.  So you   re more attuned to the needs of the world, you   re more aware of  international problems and what kind of     Definitely. Definitely. It disturbs me that our population as a whole is  not informed on an international basis as they should be.  Well, we   ll probably discuss that kind of philosophy once we get into  your work with the Office of International Programs.  Alright.  What do you think the legacy of the OSU Ethiopia project was or is  currently?  The legacy   define legacy for me in a term.  Looking back at the University   s land grant mission and the educational  goals of Dr. Bennett, did the project fulfill Bennett   s vision, or even John  F. Kennedy   s vision of the new frontier, that we   re going to work for  democracy? The big macro giant picture.  The legacy was this. Ethiopia suffered political upheaval after our  program ended, and we discussed that as Americans, what would happen  with the death of the autocratic type of government Haile Selassie  operated when he departed. We hoped that there was enough of a civil  service cadre in place to absorb the transition to a more democratic type  of government. That wasn   t the case. And they underwent a period of  dictatorship, but they   re still experiencing. But throughout all of this, it  was the OSU program that trained a large enough group of people that  they were the glue that held that country together. They performed the  tasks that needed to be performed to keep those institutions there and  operating. Today, where we left a group of about 200 students, it   s now  20,000. And there are other, both institutions  Alemaya and Jimma   being the same way. There   s evidence as was exhibited just recently, the  world food prize was given to an Ethiopian  Gebisa Ejeta  that went  through those institutions that we left there. And although we weren   t  there, he has a very high regard for the program, and spoke here. Did  you attend?  33  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  No.  He gives OSU the credit for him being what he is, because we left those  institutions there with people who would operate them. There are other  legacies, also. One of the most debilitating diseases of livestock is  rinderpest throughout Africa and Asia. An Ethiopian who went through  those institutions produced a vaccine for that disease which he donated  to the world for five cents. It   s in operation worldwide now, and is  contributing to the income of world agriculture, a figure that would be  astronomical.  You returned to Ethiopia in 2005, correct?  No, 2004. That was their fifty year anniversary.  Were you invited back, or how did that come about?  Yes, we were invited back. They invited a representative from OSU.  None of our top administration was able to go. So people who served on  that project went, as well as a former Peace Corps administrator, who at  that time was faculty at OSU.  What were your thoughts when you returned to Ethiopia?  What were my thoughts?  Yes.  Well, my thoughts, I anticipated seeing a lot of change, but there had  been even more than I could anticipate in the growth of the institutions.  One of the most striking things was the increase in population, which  was tremendously evident. But other changes, buildings, roads, things  like that.  Did the country progress in those forty years that you     Yes, they progressed, but there   s still a lot of abject poverty in the  country.  Did you see any effects of the Ethiopian war with Eritrea?  Oh, yes. Because I had visited both Eritrea and Ethiopia. One of my  former student   s brothers took me through the Ethiopian armaments that  they had taken over tanks, trucks and so forth that had been put in a  graveyard, more or less. He took me around and showed me the trench  work in the mountainsides where they had torn up a railroad to use the  34  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  rails to construct protection from bombs and shelling. Yes, I saw a lot of  it, from both sides.  I   ve heard that even now for some Eritreans it is hard going through the  Ethiopian project because Eritrea was part of Ethiopia at that time, they  fought for their independence, it   s still hard to go back and associate  with Ethiopians. Did you see that as the case?  Oh, yes. Definitely.  Did you personally know any Eritreans that felt this way?  Yes. In fact, I participated in work with Eritrea after they had gained  their independence. I went back to participate in a, I don   t know what  you would call it   it was a conference on the improvement of Asmara  University. I sat beside Isayas Afewerki at a banquet and visited with  him, and at that time there was supposedly general friendship with  Ethiopia, at least at the top administration level, but I detected at that  time, deep, deep animosities between a lot of the academic unit faculty  and staff. There was a deep schism between Eritrea and Ethiopia.  Overall, in this 2004 return trip, how were you treated, what was your  overall reception back there?  (Laughs) Again, I get emotional. I was received equal to family. I can   t  explain it. It   s as deep a relationship as brother to brother. That   d be the  best way I could   I feel fully a part of Ethiopia. I   ve never felt  endangered from Ethiopians at all. I have no hesitation whatsoever to go  to Ethiopia. But it   s just hard to explain.  Does the rest of your immediate family share this?  They   ve not been back and had the opportunity to develop the  relationships that I have, because after the OSU project was over, I  administered a World Bank project with OSU, and I went back many,  many times, and kept those contacts alive. But it was unfortunate, I was  the one keeping the contacts alive, not OSU, because they didn   t  participate in it, and I feel bad about that. All of the faculty that was on  the World Bank project were off-campus. They didn   t have the OSU  feeling, and OSU is a family word in Ethiopia. I don   t believe  administrative personnel here realize the     Full impact?  Yes. They just don   t grasp it.  35  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Now is there anything else about your Ethiopian experiences that we  haven   t touched upon that you would like to share?  No. I   m sure there are, but all I have to say, it was a great experience, it  continues to be so in my contacts. Although I don   t travel there  anymore, I have a tremendous correspondence contact, telephone  contact with Ethiopians. As I said, it became a major portion of my life.  Now we   re going to get into your work with the Office of International  Programs, which I now believe is called the School of International  Studies, is that correct?  That   s, as nearly as I can determine, they fill the role.  You came back in 1968. Was there a job lined up for you at OSU, or  how did you become involved with the Office of International  Programs?  When I came back in 1968, I came back as a graduate student in  agronomy. I was on an assistantship. I guess it was in 1973 I was offered  a job with the Dennison Peanut Company, which I took. I was there five  years, and it was at that time that I was offered a job with the Office of  International Programs. I came back to OSU in 1978.  What were your responsibilities for that job in the Office of International  Programs?  It was varied, but my major responsibility was with international  students and sponsors of those students. Now when I say sponsors, I  mean within their countries or at least outside the United States. I would  contract, in the name of OSU, for their specific educational needs, and  these sponsors would pay for the terms of that contract.  So you would be involved if, say a university in Pakistan didn   t offer a  program in Biochemistry, they would contact you to set up that work for  a particular student?  Yes.  Is that my understanding?  That   s it. That   s exactly right. Because the Office of International  Programs was the entity that did the contracting for the services of  Oklahoma State University. We were a central office.  Did you assist foreign exchange students then?  36  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Yes.  What kind of assistance did the office provide?  The foreign exchange?  Yes. Foreign students, international students, what kind of assistance did  the office provide at that time?  Well, (laughs) as I said, we would contract, and we would provide  services for a fee to those students. If they needed to go to the hospital,  we saw to it that they got to the hospital. If they needed, we saw to it that  they had supplies; we saw to it that they had adequate housing. I don   t  know how to describe it. We took care of their needs. Now, outside of  the academics, we saw to it that they had adequate contacts in the  academic field, but we didn   t dictate the teaching or anything like that.  We provided the support services, even to the handling of their monies  from their sponsor, and reporting their academic progress, and any  required reporting to their sponsor, whether it be private or  governmental or otherwise.  Would you say it would be like a mini-consulate?  That would be a good comparison, yes. A mini-consulate, because we  handled also the immigration process for them.  The student visas.  The student visas. Yes.  Did you have a role working with the student visas then?  Yes.  Now, what was your title? From the book on the Office of International  Programs by Jerry Gill, you were called the Associate Director. Now,  was that the accurate title of your position?  Yes.  Just clarifying that. Now, you had worked with Bill Abbott in Ethiopia.  Was he the one that recommended you for this position?  He was the one that hired me. Yes.  Could you describe for us the working relationship and your overall  37  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  relationship with Bill Abbott?  Well, he hired me, and the job description, he was partly responsible for,  that job description was determined by the administration of the program  in Ethiopia, and to the extent that he was their agent in choosing a  person to fulfill that job description, that is how I came into the program.  I filled the need for the type of person that they had determined ahead of  time that they needed.  What years did you work for the Office of International Programs?  1978 through    93, or, through    92.     92 was the year you retired?  I retired January 3, 1993.  Oh, so close enough.  Yes. Close enough.  Where were your offices located?  First we were located in the USDA building, above the police  department, and then in the Watkins     The Wes Watkins Center?  The Wes Watkins Center.  You came back to OSU in 1978, and you were here in the    50s. What  kind of changes did you see between those two times?  The first thing that I would notice was the expansion of the campus, the  physical plant. Along with that came an increase in the number of  students, but basically that was about it.  Could you describe for us the history of the Office of International  Programs prior to your arrival?  Well, as I said, there was considerable evolution in the final title of  Office of International Programs. I really don   t know much about the  history from, let   s say, 1950 is a fair date for the beginning of the Office  of International Programs, and its termination in what, 19-, when did it  cease to exist? I retired in    93, and it continued to exist for awhile  thereafter. I really don   t know, coherently, the procedure that it went  38  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  through.  I heard that President Willham was influential in the office, do you know  what kind of influence that he had?  On the Office of International Programs? Very definitely he did. He was,  essentially, you would say, a part of it, because we answered directly to  the president of OSU. Not through any other office. So he was very  influential in that respect because he reported directly to him and he  directly back to us.  Did he shape like the mission and vision of the office?  Yes, he did. Yes, he did. Because he, like Henry G. Bennett, was very  internationally minded, and supported programs of OSU internationally,  and consequently the Office of International Programs being the entity  responsible for contracting for the services of OSU, we had a very close  relationship with him.  Could you flesh out more his vision of how internationally he viewed the  world? Could you describe that more?  Yes. In that he wanted to see campus-wide every college being involved  in international projects, even to the extent of student exchanges, faculty  exchanges, of this nature. Even down to the single student, and groups of  students. He also was a strong supporter of contractual agreements for  educational objectives in foreign countries. He had a broad vision of  international education.  Do you know where he got this perspective?  Probably from Henry G. Bennett. (Laughs) Not entirely, no. He was his  own person, in every aspect. He came to OSU no doubt with that  concept. Where he developed it, I would say it was at a young age,  probably, in his advanced degree work somewhere.  Did you ever meet him?  Yes.  Did you meet him, actually, in Ethiopia?  No, I met Oliver Willham right here.  When was that? When did you first meet him?  39  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  I can   t name a time, but I can name an incident.  Please share with us the incident.  Well I   m not going to share all of the incident. (Laughs)Because I have  one concept of it, and others have another. But there used to be a, what  would you call it, a tradition between  the  aggies and engineers. I don   t  know whether you   re familiar with it or not.  I   ve heard stories about statues being stolen, animals being stolen, that  type of thing.  The statue is the incident that I   m talking about. And there   s some  differences of opinion that I   ll not go into. But, the bull over in the  animal science disappeared. A very good friend of mine, whom I will  not name, was president of the Ag Council. He was also president of the  Agronomy Club. My brother was vice-president of the Agronomy Club.  I was secretary of the Agronomy Club. And those three got an invitation,  I will say, to see Dr. Willham. Dr. Willham was sitting at his desk, and  we were the three of us on that side. He said,    I   ve been told that the  Agronomy Club was responsible for the theft of the bull.    My friend, the  president of the Agronomy Club said,    Dr. Willham, that   s the most  absurd thing I   ve heard.    And he leaned across the desk, and it seemed  like his finger was that long, and he said,    That   s what I told them.  You   re not the type of individuals that would do such a thing.    And we  were. (Laughter)  And you were.  From that day on I knew that Dr. Willham knew, because the head of the  Animal Science Department, at that time, was a very close friend of  mine. I grew up with him, just across the section, and I   d stayed in their  home many a night, and his brother was my close buddy. He drove to  my residence, and he said,    I want to know what you guys did with that  bull.    (Laughter)  I was just going to ask you that.  And I said,    Glenn, we didn   t have anything to do with that bull.    But  we did. And that was my first contact, real contact with Dr. Willham.  Later, in Ethiopia, I took him on extensive tours, just he and I alone, and  the opportunity to confess came up more than once, but I never did. But  I knew that he knew, so we   ll leave it at that.  Whatever happened to that bull?  40  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Well, they found it. I don   t know exactly when. I know where. And it  doesn   t square with the story that was told in the O-State Magazine. So  again, we   ll leave it there.  Alright.  Because there are plenty of people still living, a lot of them are gone,  that participated in that.  Why was there such a rivalry between the engineers and the ag  students?  I don   t know why that would develop, but it did. But the theft of the bull  arose because the two divisions, ag and engineers, got together and  arbitrarily agreed there would be no more of that. But we decided there  would be. (Laughter)  Did they ever get payback?  No.  Because you guys kept silent of who did it?  We kept silent of who did it, of course, but they knew that it was the ags  that did it, because, we also covered the pyramid with cow manure.  I   ve heard that story.  And we also ran a flag, my brother painted a Hereford bull on a bed  sheet, on a white bed sheet, a nice piece of art, and we ran it up the  engineers    flag pole, and wired it in place, and greased the pole.  Oh, so they couldn   t get it down?  So they couldn   t get it down. But they did.  Now, what kind of pranks did they pull on you guys?  Well, they really didn   t.  Really?  No, no, no. No, they, for some reason, by doing that we thought that  they would, but they didn   t. I guess they were more cultured than we  were.  41  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  You guys had your fun with them, that   s for sure.  We did.  What a nice transgression. What was your relationship with President  Kamm? Did you meet him, know him?  He   s a close friend of mine.  Close friend?  Yes. Close friend. Very close. I met him first, I guess, when he visited in  Ethiopia. From that time on we had coffee, meals. Bob Kamm was a  great person, and his wife, also.  How did he view the Office of International Programs?  I really don   t know, Jacob. He was always supportive of the work that  we were doing, and he was a pleasure to work with. He didn   t always  agree with what we wanted to do, but we always found common ground.  It was an amicable relationship, very definitely.  What about President Boger?  At that time, it was     I   m just going through the presidents that you worked with.  There was a transition attitude taking place at OSU. They were, for some  reason, I say they, I couldn   t name people or anything like that, but it  was a felt movement away from international programs. International  programs had, in many people   s mind, too much power. Because we  answered directly to the President. We handled all of the contracting.  There were reasons that people were concerned, because we didn   t, we  were not a budgeted entity. We developed our own income. I   d be the  first to say, many of those contracts were lucrative contracts due to  overhead and so forth, and we had a lot of money. There was resentment  for us having that money, because we could spend it as we determined.  We could write checks, things like that, which the other people of OSU  could not do. We didn   t have to go through the comptroller. We had our  own bank account at the bank downtown, Stillwater National Bank. I  could assist a student in paying their tuition, just by opening my desk  drawer and writing a check right there, that they could take to the bank.  Or that they could go to the Bursar and pay their tuition.  So the income came from these contracts?  42  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Yes.  Primarily.  Yes. But we provided, as I said, a lot of services. We handled the  information about OSU to the rest of the world. We published colored  journals in seven languages.  Oh wow.  And distributed those worldwide. So we provided services to OSU and  we paid for a lot of travel of administrative personnel to projects and so  forth, that otherwise they may not have been able to do. This was for  individual faculty, also, to attend conferences internationally, and so  forth.  Now, what about working with President Campbell? Did you work with  him that much,?  That was when it all came to an end, so our work with Dr. Campbell was  not too friendly an encounter. Although, I got to know John fairly well.  John was a good person. He wasn   t operating unilaterally. He had others  behind him who were insisting on change. And it came to pass.  Did you ever work with Dr. Halligan?  Not at all.  What were the benefits of working in the Office of International  Programs? Like, personal, or what did you feel   .  Well, if you wanted to do something and you had the approval of Bill  Abbott, the only other person you had to convince was the president,  you had more freedom of action. You didn   t have to go through all the  rigamaroo of regents and comptrollers, and this that and the other. You  could operate more freely.  That   s kind of nice to have a two man bureaucracy, then, right?  Yes, really. I personally think it was very effective.  Did you travel extensively when you were in the office? Overseas?  No, I didn   t. I didn   t. I did when we had a project, yes, but just to take at  junket, no.  43  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  What were some of the projects that you recall that you worked with or  on?  Like I said, when the Ethiopia project ended it seemed like that we  withdrew or began a withdrawal from international projects. The scale of  the international contact was reduced. Most of my work was related to  supporting the colleges in programs that they chose to participate in.  Now, they always chose to participate in them, when the Office of  International Programs was more active. But the relationship changed,  they became more involved in their own contracting and so forth, on  their terms.  How would you go about securing a contract? Could you describe that  process for me?  Ordinarily it was a contract from a sponsor, whether they be  governmental or institutional or some other private entity. Then, the  other way was through the US government. They would identify projects  that they wanted to fund and then they would ask institutions to submit  proposals. In the beginning they were quite simple, but they became  more and more and more complex and more competitive. We didn   t  seem to fare too well in the attaining of contracts.  So they were like grant competitions in a way?  Oh, yes. That   s what it was.  Did you put feelers out to universities worldwide that,    Hey, come to  OSU, we offer these services        Oh, yes. That   s what I was mentioning when we furnished information  in seven languages. Those went to educational institutions worldwide.  They went to US Embassies and consulates. They went to ministries of  education in those countries that we printed that language in. That even  included Arabic and Chinese. Yes. So we actively contacted sources for  students.  And these were basically snapshots of the university?  They were snapshots of the university but they also described the  curriculum and degree plans available in the various colleges of the  university.  Where were you most successful about bringing in students? What  countries stand out  that  you brought in, like the most Pakistanis, or  where were you most successful when you were there?  44  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Certain South American countries, primarily Venezuela and Columbia,  somewhat Bolivia, then there was Thailand, Malaysia, Jordan, India,  Pakistan, and even China. We had a sizeable group here from the Labor  Department in China.  Did you mention Thailand?  Yes.  Did you help bring about the Thai connection to OSU?  Yes. OSU had a development program similar to the Ethiopia program  in Thailand.  Describe your relationship with Bill Abbott. How did you work together,  what was he like personally, that kind of information about him.  I always had a good relationship with Bill, and to me it   s a very sad tale  the way he ended his career at OSU. He exercised, for many years, a lot  of power at OSU in the international sphere, and is responsible to a great  extent for OSU involvement internationally, just as Henry G. Bennett  and Oliver Willham were. Bill was always a fine fellow to me. In the  end, I think our relationship suffered a bit because they terminated his,  well, career at OSU in a manner that I   m not in agreement with. But I  didn   t have the power to influence it. I think Bill might think that I  didn   t do enough to prevent it, but it was a change that probably needed  to be made, Jacob. Let   s just leave it there, but our relationship was  excellent.  What was his personality like? Was he jovial?  Oh, yes. Bill was jovial, he was easy going, but when it came down to  business he was a very astute businessman in the sense that things would  accrue to the entity that he was representing. He was shrewd.  Was he, I hate to use the term, always looking to make a buck, is that the  type of personality he was?  Oh, yes definitely. Definitely. Because we had to maintain our own way,  and (laughs) we were able to do that.  How did he get along with various presidents? Did he work well with  them, or     With Henry G., excellent; with Oliver Willham, excellent; with Bob  Kamm, excellent; with Larry Boger, and with John Campbell, not at all.  45  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  How did Bill Abbott become involved with the office? Do you know that  story?  At a very young age, I don   t know the name of the program that he was  involved with, but it involved going to Washington, and as I said, Bill  was a very shrewd negotiator, and he made his mark early and  participated in the Washington oriented involvement of OSU. Not  necessarily international programs, they were state oriented programs,  and that was back under Henry G. Bennett. So, that   s about all I could  say.  How was the organization run structurally? Like who made the  decisions?  The ultimate decision, of course, was Bill   s, but he was very receptive to  suggestions, ideas, plans, definitely.  What was your office like? How many people worked in the office  besides you and Bill? Were there secretaries?  Yes, there were secretaries.  I   m just trying to get an overall picture.  There were secretaries and we had accountants in our office that did the  accounting work. There were students, well there were people who  handled the student work under me. There were, well I had one, two,  three, four people full time that worked with students.  Wow.  Well, because all international students that were sponsored came  through our office. So that was a sizeable number. I even took care of  their sponsorship monies, but it all passed through the accountants     office. But I had to keep, because I did the reporting to the sponsor and  the expenditure of the funds, the academic progress of the student, and  so forth, or whatever else they requested.  Did the office work with campus faculty?  Yes.  How would they involve campus faculty?  Often times a student would be admitted to Oklahoma State University,  a sponsored student, to a graduate degree program. I would work with  46  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  the respective department that he or she was going to study in to identify  a major advisor. Then, I would work with the student and the major  advisor then in setting up their curriculum and their financial support for  a graduate program and things like that.  How many students, on average, do you think OSU would have during a  given semester, during your time? Foreign students?  You mean that came through our office?  Yes, that came through your office. How many did you work with?  It varied from year to year, but, I was trying to think, we would have in  the neighborhood of 400 sponsored, 400-500 sponsored students.  How did the office fit within the university   s land grant mission?  That   s a hard one to answer. I don   t think we operated within the land  grant system, really, because the land grant system was in the beginning  viewed as an educational opportunity for the rural populous. And  especially the lower income end of the population, whereas the Office of  International Programs operated entirely internationally. So if the land  grant system had an international aspect to it, we participated in it.  Would you consider it as part of the outreach component of the triangle?  Yes. Yes, yes. That   s a good way to put it. Because definitely the  international aspect in effect would affect the land grant people. The  populous of a state and nation.  How do you think having international students benefits the university?  The first thing that anybody would notice would be the cultural  exchange. And underneath that would be the political differences,  because most international students are quite well informed of politics,  more so than we are. That exchange does take place in informal  meetings, ordinarily. Friendships that are formed, and the exchange is  made at that level.  How is it beneficial for the student, once they arrive, besides the  educational aspect? What do you think that the people of Oklahoma can  offer a foreign student? What kinds of values? Do you know what I   m  trying to get at? What can a student take back that they learned about  Oklahoma?  (Laughs) I   ll put it this way. I was taking a graduate student, he had  47  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  completed a doctoral degree and I was taking him to the airport, and I  asked him the question, I said,    What impressed you most about the  United States, and specifically Oklahoma?    He said,    This   ll sound  funny to you, but what impressed me was that everybody can drive their  own car directly to their house.    (Laughs) You don   t think too much  about that, but in many countries of the world, you   d have to park your  car fifty miles away and travel by some other means to get to your  house. So, we gave to them a sense of development, rural development  especially, that they didn   t see in the way we would get products to  market, the way we would travel to visit one to the other. In other words,  we gave to them a broader concept of community.  Talking to students was there a sense of democratic values imparted on  them, too?  Oh yes, very definitely. They readily saw the differences in our  transition, as I said, of power, from one administration to the other. They  marveled at how that worked, and they tried to understand how that  worked.  And that it could be done.  And that it can be done, yes.  That   s good. How did the office evolve when you were in the position?  Did it grow, or did you add more?  Yes, it grew, in that I was the primary mover in getting information  about OSU into other languages, and getting it disseminated as broadly  as I could worldwide. So it evolved in, for one thing, an increased  number, although as a percentage of the student body, it didn   t change.  Because student population had expanded.  That   s right. But our numbers of students increased.  Now, what kinds of programs were expanded under your leadership?  I would say the student programs, sponsored programs, primarily  because our developmental contracts diminished, and we concentrated  on training programs of short duration, graduate programs under  sponsorship those types of programs.  What were some of the challenges that the office faced?  As I said, the evolutionary changes that were taking place in the desire  48  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  to decentralize the international involvement of OSU, and that the  respective departments and colleges would do their own international  work.  Now, is that the model that is currently in place?  Yes.  Where the colleges do their own work?  That   s right.  Is that how the office has evolved since you have left? To that structure?  Well, it stayed that way at least.  What about some significant changes since you left? What have you  noticed that the, besides the name change to the School of International  Studies.  Well, the fact that it is International Studies. That   s a very added  necessity.  So it helps that, now correct me if I   m wrong, but your office didn   t deal  with OSU students going overseas?  No, it did not.  So now the School of International Studies deals with it both ways?  And that is something that has changed over time. When I was a part of  the International Programs Office the university did not encourage OSU  students being involved in overseas study. That is the change since I left  the office.  Where do you think the program is currently headed? Where do you  think the School of International Studies is headed? Do you think that  someday, as a requirement, I   ve heard this saying, that one of the  missions currently is that     Every student shall have an international experience?  Yes.  I think that   s a noble dream, but I think the     49  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Is it feasible?  It   s feasible that a greatly increased number will have an international  experience, and should have, but 100 , I doubt that that will take place.  I certainly will not see it, but I say it   s a goal to shoot for. I think the  School of International Studies has played an integral part in creating  that concept. I don   t think that rests with the president alone, and I think  that   s evidenced by the fact that Dr.  James  Hromas did push, and  others, Larry Boger and others, did push for a School of International  Studies, the establishment of an African studies group, things like that. I  think that is an indication that we   re moving in the right direction.  Is there anything that you would like to add about the Office of  International Programs?  I think it was a very effective tool in involving Oklahoma State  University in international work. But it also was an entity that would not  last forever, because it did not fit the administrative process that OSU  wanted to move in the direction of, and that was decentralization.  Now one last question before we end this, how do you feel about  Oklahoma State University, generally? Where does it hold in your life?  Can you describe that feeling for us?  Yes. I guess I could say it   s been my life, in the greater aspect. Now,  there are some things I do not agree with in the development of  Oklahoma State University, and that is sports coming ahead of  academics. I cannot see that, and as one of our noted coaches made the  statement that athletics is the front door to the university. I cannot agree  with that. I cannot agree with that. So I would like to see more emphasis  placed on academics than is placed on sports. That bothers me. Although  I enjoy sports. Tremendously. Tremendously. But the emphasis that is  placed on that is overgrown.  How do you feel about Mr. Pickens and his recent contributions to the  university?  In academics, or     Yes, academic.  I   m all for it. I applaud him for it. Give more.  That   s right. Empty out that bank account.  You bet. (Laughter)  50  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Is there anything you would like to add that we haven   t covered in the  last three hours here?  Well, back to OSU, I think it   s a great institution. I would like to see it  even more heavily involved in international enterprises. One of the  things, I think, is in student exchanges and faculty exchanges. On a one  to one basis, I think there   s great room for progress there, and a way to  change world attitudes, especially the way people think about the United  States. That bothers me, because when I went overseas, they almost  worshiped Americans. It   s not that way today, and I don   t think it needs  to be that way. So I   d like to see greater faculty and student exchange  programs implemented.  And how would you like to be remembered?  As somebody that helped people who needed help.  Well, I thank you for your participation in this interview today.  -------  -------
