 Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Today is July 28, 2014. My name is Tanya Finchum along with Juliana  Nykolaiszyn. We   re with Oklahoma State University Library, and today  we   re in Jet, Oklahoma, to speak with Billy and Bonnie Stanley, and this  is part of our Oklahoma Centennial Farm Families Project, so thank  you for having us today. Let   s begin with having you give us the history  of the ownership of the farm, how the family initially came to have it,  and then work our way forward to today.  The land actually was settled in the Land Run in 1893 by her granddad,  Trigg Jett. We have a Trigg Stanley in our family, so make sure and get  that right. (Laughter) Then after that, his son owned it, Wayne Jett.  When he passed away and they settled his estate, her mother, Clara Jett  Hopkins, bought it. From that ownership, then it was given to us, and  we   ve lived here since 1955. We   ve probably been here longer than any  of the rest of the owners.  Do you have any idea why Trigg chose this piece of property to begin  with?  The Jett brothers, there were five that made the run and another one that  came and bought some property a little bit later, that were old enough.  The other Jett brothers weren   t old enough to make the Land Run. You  had to be of legal age, and they weren   t that old, so they couldn   t make  the run. They came later. There was eight. No there was more. It was  eleven     Eleven.     in that family, and they all settled in this area. That   s why the town is  named Jet. It   s after that Jett family that made the Land Run. Trigg  settled on this place. Newt Jett settled on the place across the road. Dick  Jett settled on the one south of that. Warner Jett settled across the road to  5  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  the west, and then  John  Jett settled south of the highway, so they were  all in a row across this area. Where they lived in Kansas they had to haul  water, and so they wanted a place where there was ample water. All of  these places have some water on them, but Grandpa Jett   s place actually  just has runoff off of the others, so he didn   t really have a well or a good  water supply.  But they came from     But the others all did have good water.  They came from Kentucky, Oldham County, Kentucky. Great-grandpa  James Proctor fought in the Civil War at Perryville Battle. I think that  was one reason that they left there and went to Boone County, Indiana.  Then they heard about the run, they was going to have a run, and then  they came to Kansas, so that was kind of the     They moved to the Pilot Knob area around Harper, Kansas, and then  made the land run from that.  What order was Trigg in that   was he     He was   let   s see.  William was the oldest, and then Dick, and then Trigg.  Trigg was about the third.  Third.  They lost one that drowned in Kentucky, an older one.  William.  William, he drowned when he was a baby, or a smaller age.  How much acreage was the original piece?  Hundred and sixty acres.  What is it today?  This place is 166 acres, but he owned other land around it. Later he  bought land around it.  The six acres is off of the west place because he wanted water. He  6  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  bought six acres off of the neighbor, too, and that   s the reason it   s 166  acres.  What did he grow on it initially?  Alfalfa.  Corn, oats.  I don   t think much wheat.  They had wheat on some of the other places, but on this place they  didn   t.  Not on this place they didn   t.  It was more corn and alfalfa, feed for the horses.  What were some of the first buildings he put up?  Well, had the dugout first. From then, it was a barn, and it was     Granary.  Then the granary. Then the house was built in 1901 and smokehouse,  cellar     The old Delco system, was that where they had the        the wash house. They had a dug well underneath the wash house.  Grandma had to go down there to do her laundry. They had a Delco  system in that building. They had electricity from that.  The washer was down underground?  Tubs and scrubbers, scrub boards. (Laughter) They didn   t have a  washing machine.  And she had to carry the wet     Yes.     up the steps to hang them out?  Right, hang them out on the line.  7  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  We   ve heard a little about a Delco, but we don   t know that much about  it. Do you?  It was a battery system called a wind charger. It run a generator. It  would store electricity in the batteries. It was a DC system instead of an  AC system, which is direct current and alternating current. Everything  was DC current and would run off the battery power.  They used that just for the washer or for other things?  Everything.  Everything.  What electricity power they had was DC battery power.  Are any of those buildings still standing?  The wash house with the Delco system is still standing but not in the  same location. We moved it out by the road, and she had an antique shop  in it, but it   s still there.  The north barn where their horses     The north barn that they had their horses in. The big barn that would  hold a hundred ton of loose alfalfa hay burned. It was caused from  internal combustion. The hay was too green when they put it in the barn,  and then when the humidity and atmosphere got right it would combust  internally. That   s what burned the barn down. There was five barns  burned that day, and this was one of them, on this place. Then after that,  they never did build that big barn back. They built a horse barn and a  granary.  Then later the round top.  Then just before World War II they built a round top. I don   t remember  what year that was,    40,    39 or    40. They built a round top. The granary  that is out here, but it   s getting in pretty bad repair. It used to be east, oh,  probably two or three hundred feet. Had a big flood, and it was full of  wheat. The water got up to the eaves on it, and they had to go in and take  picks and shovels and dig all the wheat out and spread it out on the  ground and dry it. Fed it to hogs.  I always think, too, that Grandpa was a real strong man. I mean he  wasn   t afraid of work. I   m not sure the year spans that this all happened,  but his barn burned, the flood took the granary, he had a sixteen-year-old  8  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Finchum  daughter that died with tuberculosis, he lost his wife with cancer. Oh  my, he had so many hardships, but he never gave up. He just kept right  on. His youngest son was, he wasn   t really mentally retarded, I shouldn   t  say, I guess, but he was not capable of doing his work.  He was capable of working. He wasn   t capable of managing     His business.     his business. Her mother was his guardian, and she took care of him.  When Grandpa lived here, he had a stroke. We lived over about two  miles from here, and Mother took him in because there wasn   t any rest  homes then like there are today, so she took him in and took care of him.  Then Uncle Wayne lived here. Well, he was afraid to stay. That house  that I was born in, (we call it    up here on the Ball hill     W.L. Ball was  the original owner ) they moved it over by the folks and Uncle Wayne.  He was close to Mother where she could take care of him. He had so  many things that happened to him, and I think that   s what today makes  me think we don   t have it bad when I look at what he had.  So how many children did he have?  Eight. Four boys and four girls.  And your mother was in what     She was next to the youngest, and she was born in 1911.  When the property came into her   let   s back up. Was she born in the  house that was on the farm at that point? Was she born at home?  Yes, this house right here.  In this house?  Yes. Yes.  This is the 1901 place?  You   re sitting in the old part of the house. We built on three sides of it.  In 1974 we added on, built on three sides of it. The old house is still in  here.  So when you were a youngster, you came to visit this?  9  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Finchum  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Yes, this was Grandpa Jett   s. Mother always cooked for harvest when  they started thrashing hay and baling. She would cook for the harvest,  and then she   d go down and work at the field and either run the buck  rake or sit at the   there   s a stationary baler, and she   d poke the wires in  and do all that. Anyway, this was the history of the Jetts, right here.  (Laughs)  Well, from your memory as a child, talk about the house a little bit,  about the various rooms in the house at that point.  It was four rooms, and then the kitchen here was a, they used it kind of  to store their wood for the winter, but then they had to make a bedroom  for all the family. This was really a five-room home with eight kids.  When they left here, it was only a three-room home, then the porch was  added on.  And did it have running water?  No.  An outhouse, outbuilding?  Yes.  A one-seater or two, or more than that with eight kids?  You know, I   m not sure.  First one I remember was a one-seat.  One, yes.  When we moved here, that was just a one-seater. There wasn   t any water  then, either. They had a cistern, but no running water.  When we were married, (this has always been our home) there wasn   t  any running water, no bath or nothing. We wasn   t married very long,  and then we put in the running water. We run the water from that well  up here to a   there   s an old wash house behind the house. We put an  electric pump in there and then run it into the house from that well down  there. That was our water supply, and then we put in the bathroom.  They had a neighbor where her folks lived was going to move to town,  and so they sold everything out of their house. We bought their water  1 0  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  pump and hot water heater and     The tub. (Laughter)     the tub with feet on it. They gave us the pipe if we wanted to dig it up,  so I went over and dug up all of the pipe. We bought the other stuff from  them, and we brought it over here. That   s where I got the pipe to do the  plumbing and everything with, was out of their house. Their pump was  about as far from the house as this one was, so there was pipe all the  way, and we had enough pipe to bring it from the well down there, up  here.  That was the first of any running water or electricity. Well, Grandpa had  electricity, but no bathroom or running water.  It   s a good day, wasn   t it, then, when that     Yes.  It was a good day. It was.  Do you remember about when electricity came to the farm?  Nineteen thirty-eight was the first electricity from Alfalfa Electric which  was a REA  Rural Electric Association  company. Where I lived, we  didn   t have electricity until    41. We were past the end of the line that  they had designed, and we had to wait until there were others that lived  there. They wouldn   t extend it for one family, but they would for two.  None of the other families wanted electricity, so we didn   t have any until     41 when they came out with an expansion program and added more  lines.  Things we take for granted today. So when your grandfather gave up the  farm, gave up farming   well, let   s back up. Before, did he have people  that helped him when he was doing the actual farm work himself?  Well, he had his boys, and then two of them went to war, went to World  War I.  There was four sons, and they all helped with the farm at one time or  another until World War I. Two of the boys, Everett and Leonard, were  drafted, and they left Cherokee on a troop train and came back through  this place on the troop train. Then they went to Texas to their basic  training and went to France during the war and came back, and they  were both on the same troop. They stayed together all the time they were  in the service. They were in the same outfit. When they came back, they  1 1  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  came back through this place on the troop train going back to Cherokee,  which is the county seat. One of them didn   t want to have to walk home,  so he jumped off of the train when it went through, rolled down the  grade, and got all skinned up. The other one rode in, and Grandpa was  waiting in town for him. (Laughter)  It was a team and wagon. (Laughter) That story was always real     everybody always got a big joke out of that. Then when they came back  then, Uncle Leonard, he didn   t want any part of the farming. Uncle  Virgil, he was there, but he was just kind of a problem child. Grandpa  would set him up, got him a tractor when they came out and everything,  but he   d go up behind the railroad and shut the tractor off and walk to  town. You know you couldn   t depend on him.  Finally, he went to Oregon and worked in a alfalfa mill, and he was shot  in a gambling deal. That was another one that Grandpa lost, a son, too.  Anyway, they shipped his body back. My aunt that had lived in  Watonga, he shipped it to her. When she got the package, she said it was  just full of alfalfa leaves. He had one daughter, and in about the   70s, I  think, she came back from Escondido  CA . They had been up to her,  and she wanted to find out what really happened to her dad. All the  pages in the courthouse was ripped out, and they had no record of it. So  we don   t know what really happened, only he was shot.  We always thought the sheriff was in on it because the pages were torn  out of that.  They said he had a lot of money he had won in gambling. They figured  that probably somebody just relieved him of it. I remember when they  brought him back and there was two south windows there, and they put  him in a casket on the library table. I can remember somebody lifting me  up and looking in there because I have that memory. I know because I  was probably about four years old. That   s kind of the history of that part.  Well, did your grandfather work off the farm?  No.  No, so he made his living on the farm.  Yes, and when he got where   I had two other sisters, and we would just   be  behind him continually. We was with him. He never went anywhere  unless he had a shovel. He would take sand burrs. He would, you know,  just walk and walk and walk, and we   d get tired. He never quit taking  care of the sand burrs. He always was busy doing something.  1 2  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  After he quit the farming and the in-laws and the kids took over, he did  the cooking. When they were in the field, putting up hay or bundles or  thrashing or whatever, he cooked for them. They   d all come in. They  always talked about how good his biscuits were because he made  biscuits almost every day in a big wood range. There was two windows,  one there and one there, and the range was between them and a fireplace  that had a chimney. That   s where he made the biscuits, was on that old  wood stove.  I can remember he would be rolling out biscuits, and I mean they were  big pans because they had a lot . He   d have a white apron on, and he   d  do like that, and he   d reach down and get some wood and stoke it in the  stove and wipe his hands off and go right back to kneading the dough for  of the biscuits. (Laughter) Well, it worked. He could put up some pretty  good biscuits, I know that, and fried chicken. We had a lot of fried  chicken.  He, himself, actually fried the chicken?  Oh, yes  He done all of it, yes.  Yes, when he couldn   t work in the field anymore, he took over the  cooking. Of course, he lost his wife, so he took care of Uncle Wayne,  and he did all the cooking for that.  You think back of all the, what people went through. We don   t have a  clue of how tough times     Yes, I don   t think people understand what the early-day settlers went  through to settle this country. Everything was the hard way. There was  no easy way to do anything. They had to go through bad weather. After  they made the Land Run in 1893, that winter was really cold, down to  zero. Of course, the dugout was pretty warm, but as far as other clothes,  they didn   t have the kind of windbreaker clothes with insulation and  everything like we have now.  Grandpa was married before he made the run. Uncle Leonard was the  oldest. Grandma was expecting with Uncle Edward. Mother would tell  that Grandma   of course, the dugout, she was living in the dugout. She  was standing at the door of the dugout, and an Indian was riding a horse  and came across. She said she was scared for her life because she didn   t  know really what to expect. She said he stood there and watched her for  a while and went on southwest on the horse.  This place is sitting right on what   s called the Cantonment Trail. Went  from Ark City  Kansas  to Canton, and Canton was the last Indian  1 3  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  outpost where they would go in and get supplies. They would deliver it  from Ark City to Canton, so this is right on the trail of that, went by  Barrel Springs across the road here and down to Timberlake Springs. All  those trails were developed where they could find water to take care of  the horses and people to get water.  So the farmers on that, and then it was obviously close to a railroad,  then, too?  The railroad came in in 1905, and the town of Jet was, at that time, two  miles east of where it is now. They had a choice of either moving the  town to the railroad or the railroad would start in town. The road where  the town was was called Albert Pike Highway, which was not a  highway. It was just a trail from Hot Springs, Arkansas, to Colorado  Springs, Colorado. They crossed the railroad, and Albert Pike Highway  crossed where the town of Jet is. That   s where they set up the town site.  Before it was ever paved, then it was later graveled, and some bridges  put in. That   s where the town was originally. It was two miles east of  where it is now.  But the first was right across the road at Barrel Springs.  Yes, that was a gathering place.  A gathering place. The Jet boys would take their supplies over to Pond  Creek. They would tell some pretty hairy stories on going to Pond  Creek. (Laughs) They usually stayed all night, and then they   d bring  supplies back for the neighbors. Then they   d come over here and pick up  their supplies and mail.  It   s twenty-one miles to Pond Creek just straight through. Of course,  they had to wind around the creeks and everything.  In a wagon, it would take longer.  Yes, so they   d go over one day and stay all night. Then they   d bring  supplies back the next day when they   d take their produce over there and  sell it because that was the only railroad. It was at Pond Creek.  Does the railroad still come through Jet today?  No.  No, they took it out.  They took it out. I don   t remember what year, now.  1 4  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Finchum  Billy  I don   t either. I love the railroad. You could hear the train. You knew  about when they were going and coming. In the winter, the ground  would be frozen, and you could just feel the vibration of the ground  being frozen when the train come through. The Jett   s   the reason they  call this Jett   s is because the neighbors would say,    Let   s go over to  Jett   s and get our supplies.    That   s how it started. Then they moved two  miles east of Jet, and that   s kind of the way. Each one of the brothers  had mercantile, and the Jet Visitor, and there was two of them that was  veterinarians, and one had what was the post office. He wasn   t really the  first post master because Mr. Corbett was, but he became the post master  of Jet.  Was there a point in time when Trigg thought he might lose the farm?  No.  Was it ever in danger of     I don   t think.  He never mortgaged this place. He bought some other land that was  mortgaged, but he never would mortgage this place when he bought  other land.  Did he keep records of his business, what was coming and going, that  type of thing?  Yes, he did. In fact, we   ve got a lot of his that we have captured because  nobody else wanted it. (Laughs) We just don   t let anything get by. In  fact, when the bank failed up here, a lot of the old ledgers they gave to  the museum over at Cherokee. A lot of the guys    records through their  banking and everything was in those ledgers. Billy and I went over there  one time. We went through   . He bought quite a bit of land.  In the late   30s, early   40s, (I   m not sure exactly what time) about all of  the Jett brothers went to New Mexico and bought land out there. They  was going to get in the ranching business, and they didn   t realize how  dry it was in New Mexico until they bought some land out there. Finally,  they sold all of it.  And came back?  Yes, well, they never did move. Well, two of the Jett boys did move out  there, but the others never  did . They just owned land out there.  1 5  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Yes, Joe Jett, he lived out there. He never did come back, but John and  Henry. The youngest boy, Sam, he had a confectionary. He was real  little, and we always called him Wimpy. (Laughter) He had that, and that  was his     Made ice cream     Made ice cream, yes.     sold cigars and cold drinks.  We always wondered, how did they make ice cream with no ice? But  evidently    I don   t know.  Evidently it was the process.  Yes they did, and candy. I don   t know. In fact, we   ve got a lot of his  little pewter ice cream dishes, little spoons.  And he did that in Jet, in the town of Jet?  Yes, well he did it in the old town     Old town.     and then when they moved, he did it again. Moved over there and did  it again over there.  And then Grandpa Jett had the Jett Mercantile where they sold the dry  goods. Not only that, he farmed, and he built the Mennonite Church in  Jet. It   s Nazarene now.  They were Mennonites when they came to this area, but then as the  younger ones married, they split off. The Mennonite Church folded up  later. He pretty much built it and maintained it and kept it going.  Two of the sisters, when they made the run, after they got kind of  settled, they came down, and they cooked for their brothers. Alice and  Anna. Anna married Finch. He run the Jet Visitor, and then Aunt Alice, I  don   t know what he did. Do you remember?  Is that the one that married Rufus?  Yes.  He was a Deputy US Marshall. He settled on a place south of town, and  1 6  Bonnie  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  they married and raised their family down there. Then he got  electrocuted changing a light bulb in the basement. Something shorted  out, and it electrocuted him.  John was the sheriff at Grant County for years. You always kind of feel  like you   re selfish because I don   t want any of the things to get away  from family, but my cousin in Arizona got his badge. I thought, oh, that  would have been so neat to have, but I   m sure that will never happen. I  always thought that was so neat. He was a veterinarian, too, so really not  only just one trade, but they did a lot of other things. Threshing crew  and     There was a big livery barn in the old town of Jet. That   s where the two  Jett brothers that were veterinarians, that   s where they operated out of,  that barn, and took care of them. They were actually horse doctors more  than they were veterinarians. I   ve got all the tools that they had to do  work on horses    teeth. They were horse dentists. If you didn   t take care  of a horse   s teeth, he would starve to death. Their teeth would get long,  and they wouldn   t line up and they didn   t fit. Then they couldn   t eat, and  so they   d starve to death. They had the equipment if they had to pull a  tooth or if they had to file a tooth down so it   d be the same height as the  other ones, whatever it took to make their mouth sound so they could  eat.  How had they learned to do that? Had they gone to official training  somewhere?  I don   t think there was any place that they went to school to learn. I  think it was just     Trial and error.     trial and error.  Being practical, I guess.  They had a lot of chemicals that they probably didn   t have any business  with because they couldn   t have really known what the chemicals would  do if they mixed them or mixed them with something that they didn   t  know anything about. There   s a whole deal of vials of all the different     Big ol    clamps that they   d go in and pull their teeth if they had to, why, I  couldn   t even hardly lift them. Uncle Dick lived uptown, and my aunt  and uncle lived right across the alley. He only had one boy, and that boy  didn   t amount to much. Uncle Dick, when he died, the boy left, and his  wife soon died, and it was just left in the house. My uncle went across  1 7  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Finchum  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  there, and he found them. He took them, and he wanted to know if we  wanted them. We said yes. We even took them down to Enid to the  museum, thinking that maybe it   d be nice to display them for people.  They weren   t interested, so we got them.  They said they would come sometime and look at them, and that they  would probably take them and put them in storage and then later put  them on display. We never did send them down there. They never did  show up, either.  During the years of the Depression, how did the farm survive?  It was tough. He had times when the machinery that he owned, they  would want to come and repossess it. He just kept telling them,    No,  you   re not going to get it.    He came through.  And something come through, and he hit maybe a good crop, or fairly  good, that gave him enough where he could hang onto everything. He  bought one, two, three, four, five, five or six quarters that he had  bought     He bought ten at one time.  Yes, ten, but he never mortgaged this one because he never intended to  lose his home. Today, I think we are the only heir that still has the land  that was in the Jett     The original...  Yes, and we bought a half section that was his. We   ve always tried to     you can   t do it all. I understand that. We   ve always tried to keep  everything we possibly could that was his and in the Jett family.  So it came to be in your mother   s hands about when?  Nineteen seventy or seventy-one, something like that.  Uncle Wayne died in    69, so it would have been about    70.  And you were born when?  Thirty-seven.  So you would have known him quite a bit, for quite a while.  Yes. You mean Uncle Wayne or     1 8  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Your grandfather.  Oh, yes, my grandfather. Oh, yes.  He lived with them     He lived with us.     after he had his stroke.  In fact, he would buy us school clothes. He   d take us to town, and he   d  buy us overalls and a red bandana handkerchief. We was thinking we  were just about the neatest kids on the street. He was always so good to  us. He raised a big garden, potatoes. Mother would can, and Grandpa  would always help her put up as much food as they possibly could  because he had that garden. Then when he got moved over with us for  permanent he told us, he said,    If you two girls will take piano lessons,  I   ll pay for it.    Well, you know, that was a big deal because it was not  much a lesson. We took piano lessons, and he paid for it. I think I took  for eight years, and my sister took seven.  You had a piano at home or     It was Aunt Edna   s. That was his daughter that died.  The daughter that died, he had bought her an upright grand, and that   s  what they learned to play on.  My daughter   s got it now. When they had the sale, she bought it. She   s  got it beautiful. It   s got ornate on it. I mean, it   s just a beautiful piano.  So from 1893 until 1970s, he had  the land ? Trigg had it?  Yes.  Once your mother got it, what did she do with it?  She kept it then deeded it to Billy and I.  Did you raise crops on it and work it, too?  Yes. Well, in fact, my dad, he farmed it. He did, and then when he gave  it up, we got it. I guess they say    gave    it to us. They deeded it to us.  Even today with some of the years that our crops have not been good,  it   s been tough. Of course, the banks, that   s the first thing they want is  1 9  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  land, but we fought for it.  The banks have changed over the years. They don   t operate like they  used to. They don   t. You   re a number. They don   t care whether you live  or die or what as long as they get their money.  What we did in the centen in 1993, about two years before that, we  decided we   d like to have a run out here and have all the Jetts that we  could possibly find, send them letters, and we   d have a three-day  celebration. Well, we did. We got a big tent, and the little shop out there  was our land office where they   d register when they   d come in, and then  there was the five Jett brothers. We had white flags that we had that  would have each one of the families have one person to run to stake the  claim. We had old cars. We had surreys. We had church service. We had  a watermelon feed. We had horseshoe pitching. What else did we have?  Horse and wagon.  Yes.  All the games that they used to play in the early days that we could find  out about, we had some of those.  We had a dance, barn dance, I mean, everything we thought they did  then because the Jet brothers played at dances with their instruments.  They went around and played at dances. We tried to make it as much  like it as we could. We had   how many did we have?  We had over 300 registered during the three-day period. Not all of them  stayed for all three days, but they would come for one day or two days.  We had about sixty-four, sixty-five first cousins. One of them, his job  took him to Australia, and he told them he wouldn   t go unless they  would let him come back for the Jett reunion. They agreed to let him  come back, so he came back. We had some from Canada and one from  Australia, besides the thirty-four states were represented.  We had church service on Sunday morning. We had one family that  took   we had a choir.  The Green family were descendants of one of the Jetts, and so they took  up the church service.  Then we ended up the day with a big hamburger fry. On Saturday night  we had a   I can   t remember what all we had, but we had the most  wonderful time. Of course, a lot of them are gone now, but that was  something that we really felt like that was worthwhile.  2 0  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  I told them, I said,    Well, there   s two times that the Cherokee outlet of  the Land Run will be important. That was the day they had it and the  hundredth anniversary. The two hundredth anniversary, there won   t be  enough people around that even heard about it to even care.  You   re twenty years into that, though, so there might be   We tried to, you know, make that a big weekend so everybody could  come. One reason why it was three days was so people that couldn   t  come on one day could come on another.  So the two of you took over farming it in the   80s?  Seventy-six. That   s when your dad retired.  Retired, yes, in    76.  And has it been your main source of income, or have you had secondary  jobs or     Oh, no.     it be primary?  Farming is     The boys did custom harvesting along with the farming. One time we  had three combines run all the way from Texas to Canada. They didn   t  go into Canada, but they   yes, they did, one year.  Yes, one year they did.  The rest of time they just went up to Montana or North Dakota. Then  they   d come back. Then they decided they   d go back south and start on  the corn harvest and that wasn   t very good. That   s a hard, bad time of  the year to try to make that corn harvest.  And we had a registered angus herd, and we had production sales.  So not just wheat then?  No.  No.  2 1  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Finchum  Bonnie  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Where would you take your wheat to market?  To the local elevator     In Jet?     in Jet. For a while we took some to the gulf, not to the gulf, but     Catoosa.  Port,  Tulsa Port of  Catoosa. When they were doing the custom  harvesting, we had two semis. In the wintertime when we had time, we   d  haul wheat. Then we started hauling wheat for other elevators around.  That was another source of supplementing the income.  We noticed the shelterbelts coming in.  Yes.  Is there a story about those?  There were a lot of shelterbelts planted. We planted some over the years.  People that   s bought the land where we planted them, they   ve tore them  all out. Probably not another dust bowl, but we   re going to pay for  taking them out because they were a big asset at one time to be able to  keep the ground from blowing.  Well, these seem like they do the job currently.  Yes.  Were there other conservation efforts done on the farm over the years?  Terraces. Terraces and waterways.  And who did those? Which generation, I guess, did those?  It was Uncle Leonard     Yes, so it   d be Grandpa   s sons.     Grandpa   s sons. When they were farming, they started doing the  terracing, and then we   ve been doing it ever since, and more terraces.  I think we   ve done over two hundred acres of terraces. (Laughs)  2 2  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  Two hundred miles.  Two hundred miles, I mean. You have to have them for erosion, help  protect the land.  The terraces, according to some, (and I kind of think they   re right) is that  it   s got more alkaline because the water   s held up on the side of the hill,  slows it down so it doesn   t run off as fast. Then it soaks into the soil and  percolates down through the soil until it comes to the shale layer. Then it  can   t go any farther down, so then it works its way down along the shale  through the bottomland. Like water is, goes to the point of least  resistance and that   s to go back up when it gets underneath the  bottomland. That   s where all the alkaline shows up is the bottom, on the  best land.  When Aunt Docia had it, they put in that where the water drains. I can   t  remember what     Oh, the tile.  The tile.  Yes, and it   s under the alkaline ground and drains to the creek. And it  helps.  It helps, yes. On that one, it runs all the time, and it has helped the alkali  because it   s kind of going away.  When the water percolates down through the soil and gets down, then  that tile will pick it up and drain it out so it doesn   t come back up.  He did that to his place, which helped.  Have much interaction with county agents through the years?  Over the years we have. We work with them in the 4-H and in the Soil  Conservation and all the practices. There   s a lot of practices you have to  be involved in in order when they have government payments for  farmland. You didn   t qualify for any government payments if you didn   t  follow those conservation practices.  Our kids was real active in 4-H and FFA  Future Farmers of America .  Through the 4-H, we had an exchange student from the Netherlands that  stayed with us through the 4-H Foundation. We went over there to see  him. I haven   t heard from him for quite a while. In fact, I think the  saddest thing was when we got home from over there, he just was royal  2 3  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Finchum  to us. We just had the nicest time with him. Of course, we didn   t stay up  with him all the time because we traveled by the train and went through  parts of the country over there. Him and his wife got a divorce, and you  would   ve never known it when we were over there. We were just so sad.  Then it wasn   t probably two years he came back, and he brought his  pimp friend with him, and that was disappointing. That   s beside the  point, but anyway, we did that through the 4-H Foundation. The national  foundation done that.  We were involved with the local 4-H, the county 4-H, the state, the  national, and international.  Go to Roundup at OSU?  Yes.  Yes.  Were you a member of a homemaker club?  Yes.  What was the name, and is it still going?  Yes, it   s still going, but it changed its name. It   s Jet Industrious Club is  what it was when I was there, but now I don   t even   . It   s  OHCE,  Oklahoma Home and Community Education  or something like that. I   m  not sure.  That   s initials?  Yes, but it was Jet Industrious when I was in it. I got out when the kids  got older and Billy and I was the one to have to do all the farming  because the boys were in school. I had to drop out because I didn   t have  time for it. But I did, I enjoyed it. I really did. I   d always compete things  in the fair, and I canned a lot.  So what was your specialty?  (Laughs) What was it?  Yes.  Canning.  Jellies or tomatoes or what?  2 4  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  I had done peaches and jelly, and I think I did     Tomatoes.     tomatoes, yes.  Ketchup. You made a lot of ketchup.  Ketchup, yes. I entered that.  Do you do much of that today?  Not today, I don   t. No, I don   t.  Do you have a garden?  No.  Not even a tomato plant?  Well, I   ve got two out here in pots, but they don   t look very good.  (Laughter)  They   re not going to make any     They   re not going to make any ketchup. (Laughter)     fruit. (Laughs)  I wish I did, but I   m not very able to, really, and we don   t hire any help.  He does the farming, and I help him, and that   s pretty much     We used to have about two acres of garden all the time.  In the early   80s when they come out with this PIK  Payment-In-Kind   program, government program, it really devastated the farming of  everybody. About    84,   85, we told the boys there isn   t enough for all of  us to live off of because they had just taken about everything the farmer  could muster up to survive.  And then the bank failed up here.  And then our bank failed up here, and we had all of our banking up here.  It just was a rollercoaster for a while. We just told them,    We   ll take the  debt. You go out and get you a job,    and they did. One boy took the  2 5  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  semi, and he hauled cattle and done that. Then it got where your permits  and insurance and going to one state after another state, it just took  everything they had, whatever you made, it took to pay that. He just  said   you know, so we sold the semi.  When we had the three combines, it got where it took eight thousand  dollars per combine and truck to buy the permits and insurance before  they ever left here, and as the combines got bigger, the trucks got bigger,  the permits got higher.  And you had to do the trailers, get bigger trailers.  It just got to the point where he had to make that much money just to  pay your startup costs, and if he didn   t have a good year, he couldn   t do  it.  And then our other boy, he went and worked on a ranch up there north  of the river for a while, and they sold it. Now he   s working construction  over at Nash, building oil field sites, so he   s got a good job.  So how many children do you have?  Two boys and a girl. Our girl   s in the middle. She   s a postmaster at  Helena Post Office. She lives in Jet, but she drives down there. The  youngest boy, he helps us with the farm, but he was a pumper for  SandRidge Oil Company. They live around where we get to see them,  not a lot, but we know they   re there.  Did, through the years, did the farm maintain the mineral rights for the  property?  All but this one down here.  One place we bought, we didn   t get the minerals with it.  But the rest of it, we do.  Has that helped?  Yes, made all the difference.  I tell you what, it was a God send to a lot of people in this area, but one  day out of the clear, we thought, we was trying to figure out,    What are  we going to do?    A guy drove in from Chesapeake and said they was  going to put a well down here on this one place. It was a good well. That  really helped. Then we sold a lot of leases for pipelines, and that has just  2 6  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  been tremendous.  A headache to keep up with all of that?  Kind of fun. (Laughter)  Yes, it   s kind of different.  Different, yes.  When did this start, then, in the   80s or   90s or just recently?  No, just this was about     Four years ago.     four years ago.  Recently.  Yes, my granddad on my mother   s side worked on a seismograph crew.  He was secretary of a little oil company in the early days of Jet. He  always said there   s oil and gas under all this land through here, but they  never did drill. If they drilled, it   s a dry hole.  But now they   re doing that horizontal drilling, and that really has been  the lifesaver. This one place, when we bought it from this lady, she  didn   t want to sell the mineral rights. Then about a year later, had a guy  from Oklahoma City call and wanted to know if we wanted to buy some  of the minerals. That   s the first we ever heard that she sold them. I called  her and said,    Why didn   t you let us know? We bought the place.    She  said,    Well, I needed the money real quick. I just took that up with        Sold it to somebody who could give her the cash.  Yes, so we lost out, but the others, we   ve got the minerals.  We   ve been offered a lot of money for the minerals, but once it   s gone,  it   s gone.  It   s gone. We won   t never get them back.  You won   t buy it back for what you sold it for. Her grandpa owned two  quarters of land. That   s where the lake is now, and if they ever drill  under that, he still owns the minerals. When the government took the  land for the lake, they didn   t get the minerals. They let the land owners  2 7  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  keep the minerals.  So it   s out there covered with water. (Laughs)  It   s close enough to the shore that they could go in that section.  Yes, they could, underneath it, yes.  We noticed some wind turbines coming up. Has that been     It   s not close enough. We   re not involved in it. That   s around Hunter  and Pond Creek, over in that area. All of that electricity that   s generated  from that wind farm goes to Georgia, state of Georgia.  Interesting.  Yes.  Yes.  Now, Alfalfa County can   t get the wind     The story is that the Alfalfa County doesn   t have enough wind.  Wind. Now, can you believe that? (Laughs)  I think most of it   s because of the air base  Vance Air Force . It   s in the  flight pattern.  That could be.  Our son, youngest son, when on the farm, he went to Vance and was a  foreman down there for probably ten years. Then he came up here   part  of Vance training. Then they decided, when they started cutting back,  that they wanted them to drive   he lived at Jet, but they wanted him to  drive to Enid, get on a van, drive back up here on the base, work until  six o   clock, go back to Enid     Get his car and drive home.     and get his car and drive home. He said,    I don   t think so. I can find  something.    Well, then he got on   that   s when the oil deal began to  really pick up, and he got     I think the biggest thing that they was trying to do was get rid of the  Union that had all the personnel in Vance that were all civilians and  2 8  Bonnie  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  firemen and maintenance and all that work. Civilians, but it was a Union  and they wanted to get rid of that, so they come up with this better idea.     You can drive to Enid and ride the van back.     It didn   t make sense, none at all. Then he just, he said no. He said,    I  don   t have no time. I leave at five o   clock and drive to Enid, then when I  get back a little after seven, and then I have to drive home.    He said,    I  don   t have any time for my wife or   .    He had a boy, and he said,    You  know, I   m not   I don   t think so.    He   s been doing this and helping us  when he can, which I don   t know what we   d do without him, really.  What   s the biggest challenge today to keeping the farm going?  Competing with the big farmers.  For prices or for what?  The big farmers, just buying up all the land     All the land.     or leasing it.  Leasing it.  They   ll just pay whatever it takes to get it. I don   t even know how it  works. They got to be doing something that I don   t know anything about  for the price of the equipment,  350,000 for a tractor and a planter and   500,000 for a new combine. That kind of     I don   t know how they     They got to be     They have other sources.  You got to farm all over the county and half of another one to make that  work.  I think that   s the real challenge. You know, bigger is not better.  Well, that   s not what settled this country.  No.  That   s not what developed this country was big operations. It was the  2 9  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  little operations, collectively, that built the elevators and built the towns  and did all that.  But you know, when I had my little shop out here, I did good. I really  did. But what really hurt is was when Walmart began to come in and  they run the mom-and-pop stores out. His aunt bought my uncle and  aunt   s property in Jet when she came back from California and she left it  to us. Well, I moved in town and put my antique and gift shop in town.  That was, it just   that was the same thing. Those big stores just run the  mom and pops out. You can   t compete against it.  The only way that she could make it work is she   d go to market, either  Denver or Dallas or somewhere, and get new items that Walmart hadn   t  started selling yet. Then she could sell those, but as soon as Walmart got  them     Got them. You know, you   d have people come in, and they   d say, you  could hear them say,    Well, you can get this at Walmart for so and so.     You wanted to say,    Then just get at it. Go for it        Get your happy butt down there and buy it at Walmart.        Go for it, lady. I don   t care, but don   t be telling that in the store.     (Laughter) I had a lot of people, tourists. I didn   t have many local  people. They just will not, and, pray tell me. I have no idea why they  don   t support the local people and merchants.  It   s that way everywhere, though.  Yes, oh yes.  You talk to business people in other towns, and they   ll say,    Well, we do  pretty good, except the locals don   t trade with us.    I don   t know what it  is.  I don   t know, but I   d have people   and it was on the highway going to  the lake, and I had people stop. I saw a lot of things just driving through  and tourists, and then the real kicker was in 9/11 when that happened.  People quit buying. I mean absolutely.  Well, they quit traveling.  They quit traveling and everything.  The tourist business dropped off. The lake up here, there was always a  lot of traffic to the lake, and it stopped. They had to go right by her place  3 0  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Finchum  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Nykolaiszyn  Billy  in town to go to the lake, and the traffic just stopped. People quit  traveling.  I used to have a lady come in and buy   oh, you know, I sold candles  and porcelain dolls and mixed them up with my antiques. A lady from  Pond Creek come and bought a lot of that, and then the furniture we had  just at an auction and sold it.  You had unique items. You had maple syrup from Vermont, you know,  places like that, they couldn   t get just anywhere.  But anyway, to this day I   ve never been in a Walmart. I don   t intend to  go. That just left a bitter taste in my mouth. (Laughs)  Well, when you look at ten of the richest women in the world, five of  them are in the Walton family. You kind of think that something   s going  on there that shouldn   t be.  Yes.  I know I   ve talked to people that sell products to Walmart. Once you  start selling to Walmart, you can   t sell to anybody else. That   s in the  contract. They control everything that they are involved in.  Where   s the closest one? In Enid?  Enid or Alva. We   re kind of in between.  And when you talk about the lake, you   re talking about Canton Lake?  No, Salt Lake. The Great Salt Lake.  Great Salt Plains Lake.  We   re close to that? Okay.  Yes, you are.  Yes, three or four miles. If you go down here to the corner and go  straight north, you   ll go by the air base and then the dam at the lake.  When you cross the bridge, all that camping and everything   s there.  How did you two meet?  I can   t remember when I didn   t know her. (Laughter)  3 1  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  We just lived two miles apart. He was two years older than I was, and  when I was a seventh grader he was a freshman. I didn   t know he was  there because I was sports. I loved basketball. I loved playing and  everything. I   d ignore the boys because I was kind of one of them.  (Laughs) I liked to be kind of rough and tumble, but then he kind of   I  don   t know just how it did happen. Do you?  It just did.  Just did, and we never dated anybody else. We dated all the way through  high school. When I graduated, he was two years ahead of me, and he  was out two years before I was. June 18, right during the harvest, we  decided we wanted to get married. Mom and Dad probably should have  shot us for that, but they didn   t. They gave us a beautiful wedding.  Either your folks or my folks, one, should have shot us     They didn   t.     getting married right during harvest. Her folks had just finished  harvesting, and they always had a custom harvester cut their wheat.  They stayed until after we got married, and then they went on back to  Kansas. We hadn   t even cut our wheat yet because we lived on sandy  ground and the wheat was later over there than it was on the hard  ground. Anyway, we got married, and her folks had just finished harvest,  and dad hadn   t started yet.  We just, I mean, really, I don   t know if I ever remember not knowing  him. He was kind of ornery because I remember Dad, before we even  started dating, he   d say,    I know that Billy Stanley is the orneriest kid I  ever saw.    (Laughs) He ended up being his son-in-law. The folks dearly  loved him so because we didn   t have any brothers. I come from a family  of four girls, I mean, four of us girls. We didn   t have a brother. My four  sisters, the oldest one had a boy, the second one had two boys, I had two  boys and a girl, I was the only girl in the   then my sister had twin boys.  In fact, one of her twins is the manager at the OSU football equipment  down at Oklahoma State.  So only one girl in that generation, then.  Yes.  Her dad always said that the Lord blessed him with four daughters, and  the devil paid him back in son-in-laws. (Laughter)  3 2  Nykolaiszyn  Bonnie  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Where did you go to school?  Jet.  It was just Jet High School then. Then Nash joined Jet later, and it was  Jet-Nash. Then Helena and Goltry went together, and it was Helena-  Goltry. Then, they, Helena-Goltry and Jet-Nash, went together and made  Timberlake, so now it   s Timberlake School. It   s named after an old  settlement halfway between Jet and Helena. Was called the Timberlake  community, named after a rancher that owned some land down there  around that area.  What about the elementary school?  It   s up here.  It   s up here at Jet, and the junior high and high school is at Helena.  When you went.  Oh, when I went? It was all up there at Jet. There was a three-story  school, and they built a new grade school in   what year was that?  Fifty-three, fifty-four. I worked on it, and it was after I graduated.  They built a new grade school. Then they tore the high school down and  built a high school and put it together. Now it   s a pre-K to the sixth  grade.  School buses then?  Yes.  When I was in the first grade, we had eight buses, and one of them had  to make two routes. First bus in had to go out to the corner where we  caught the bus, and there was seventeen of us got on the bus there, three  families. We all had to walk down to the corner, and the bus would  come out there and pick us up and turn around and go back two miles. It  didn   t matter which bus got in first. They had to come out and get us.  You   d have to be last getting to school then.  We started walking to school because sometimes in the wintertime the  bus was late and it wouldn   t get there until ten or eleven o   clock, so  we   d just walk to school. Well, then the folks found out we were  counted tardy because we walked to school, but if we waited and rode  3 3  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  the bus, even if we didn   t get there until noon, we were not counted  tardy or absent. But if you walked and was late, then you were tardy.  They were pretty strict with the way things were done then.  More so than they are now.  Probably our group was one of the most fortunate in the fact that after  World War II a lot of the veterans came home and went back to school  and then became teachers and coaches. They still remembered the  discipline that they had when they was in the service, and they used it at  school. They were tough.  Oh God, we were scared to death of them. (Laughs)  They were all nice people and good teachers, but, boy, you didn   t do  anything to     No.     upset them. It didn   t bother them to spank the kids, and they didn   t  care who didn   t like it (Laughs) because they still had the discipline that  they was in service with.  Did you experience any of the discipline?  Oh, yes. (Laughter)  Since you were ornery.  I never did get a spanking, but I got close a couple times. (Laughter)  One time we were in the state playoffs in eleven-man football before  they had eight-man, and we only had sixteen boys in high school that  could play football. We had two or three others that weren   t able  physically to play, so they were the   what do you call them?  The trainers, I mean water boys or whatever.  Trainers, kept track of the property and stuff, but they were there every  day and kept everything gathered up for us. We were going to be in the  state playoffs, and one of the teams we was going to play was playing in  Pond Creek. We asked the coach if we could go over and watch that  game because we was going to play the winner of that game. He said,     No, I don   t want you over there messing around. I don   t want any of  you over there.     One of the guys that was in our class went to Korea. He joined the  3 4  Nykolaiszyn  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  National Guard before they went to Korea, and he was a year older than  the other kids in his class. He couldn   t get out, so he had to go to Korea.  Well, when he came home under what was the GI Bill, he could get paid  to go to school. He went to high school and graduated with our class.  Well, he had a car, so about five of us went to Pond Creek to watch the  ball game. I can remember sitting over there, and we   d kind of turn  around and look,    Is there any smoke back to the west?    Anyway, we  thought,    Everything   s all right.     We got back into town that afternoon and saw the superintendent  walking down the street. We waved at him, and he waved back at us. We  thought,    We   re all right,    until the next morning. That night when I got  home, (Dad was on the school board) he said,    Where in the hell was  you today?       We went to Pond Creek to the football game. How   d you  know?       Well, they called out here wanting to know where you were,  see if you was sick.    Mom told them I wasn   t sick. They knew I had to  be over there at the ball game.  When I got to school the next morning, the superintendent, we had to go  and meet with him. He said,    Well, you boys skipped school, so I want  you to go up see Mr. Reinke   , he was our coach,    and whatever  punishment he deals out, I   ll stand behind.       We   ll go up and see Mr.  Reinke.    We got up there, and he had on a polo shirt, and his face and  neck was red clear down as far as you could see into the shirt. He lit into  us and chewed us up one side and down the other and then told us that if  we didn   t give a 110 percent that week in practice that he would cancel  the ball game. But we didn   t get a spanking. (Laughter)  But did you win the game?  We won the game. (Laughter) We practiced hard all week. We didn   t  have enough players to have another team to scrimmage against, so we   d  have to play this side of the line against this side of the line in  scrimmage. All our players going that way and then turn it around and  do all of them going this way, and that   s the way we practiced.  And you played during the day then? The games were during the day?  Yes. Yes.  Before night lights.  Yes. (Laughs)  When I started school there wasn   t any lights on the football field. The  year I was about a eighth grader, I guess, they made a deal with  3 5  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Nykolaiszyn  Billy  Cherokee. They had lights, and so all of our home games were played at  Cherokee at night. They thought they   d get a bigger crowd.  And you graduated high school when?  Fifty-three.  Then you would have been    55?  Fifty-five, yes.  And you got married in    55?  Yes, got married in    55, June of    55. We got married, and then we went  to California two years   no, about a year and half, wasn   t it?  Yes.  Because what little bit of land we had, we put in the soil bank. We went  out there and was     We hadn   t raised a crop in three years.  Three years, so we went out there, and he got on working out there right  after we moved out there. His brother was out there. We was out there  eighteen months. We had Gib, our oldest boy. We had him before we  left, and then I had our little girl Shawn, prune picker, and she was just,  like, six weeks old when we came back because his brother was coming  back, so we just moved back. That wasn   t to raise a family out there. Oh,  that was awful.  You couldn   t leave the kids out in the yard to play because somebody   d  get them.  It was just really bad.  We decided we   d just be poor and move back here where we could raise  a family.  What were you doing in California?  Well, when I went out, my brother worked at Douglas Aircraft, and he  thought he could get me on there, and I had an uncle that lived out there.  He got ahold of me and told me there was a service station that was  needing help, and if I   d go down there and apply I could probably get  on. So I did. We got there Friday night, had sixteen dollars left in my  3 6  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  pocket. (Laughter) I had flat on the way out there, and I didn   t have a  spare when I got there. I went down the next morning   no, I went down  that afternoon when we got there and applied. I went to work the next  morning. When I went down to apply   you remember the old story on  television, Ben Casey     Yes.     the doctor? When I filled out my application, the lady said,    Would  you wait here just a minute?    In a little bit the door went open about like  Ben Casey coming through the door into the operating room, and it was  the general manager of this service station. He said,    When can you go  to work?    I said,    Right now, I guess.    He said,    You show up in the  morning,    told me where to be,    and we   ll put you to work.    Because I  was from the rural Midwest, they wanted all those people they could get  because they   d work. A lot of them they had wouldn   t work, so he put  me to work as soon as I got there.  He made good money.  We had a system where if we did more business this month than we did  last month, we got a commission. With the pay and the commission, I  could make more money than my brother did working for Douglas. He   d  worked there ten years, and he was the assistant lead man. The stretch  press that made the nose cone on some of those fighter planes, the others  couldn   t set it up to do that. He   d have to set up the machine for them to  do their shift before he went home, and then he   d have to change it back  to do what they were doing. He had a good job, but I could still make  more at the service station than he was making there.  I think this guy that had the service station had seven stations through  the Long Beach     They had eleven.  Eleven?  Twelve. They had twelve because they six that were incorporated in one  deal and six in another.  Back in the days when it was full service?  Oh, yes.  Cleaned your windows and everything else?  3 7  Bonnie  Billy  Nykolaiszyn  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Check your oil.  The company gave away a Cadillac every two months as a gimmick, so  when you went out to greet a customer you gave them two tickets to the  Cadillac drawing. It didn   t matter whether they bought anything or not.  You still give them two tickets, and then you washed their windshield,  and you checked the air in the tires, you checked under the hood for the  oil and the water and brake fluid, all that stuff, washed all the windows  clear around, not just the windshield. It was full service.  And this was in Long Beach?  Yes.  You ran out. If you were working back in the shop or whatever you was  doing, you had to wash your hands, and you ran out to wait on the car,  and you ran back to make their change, and then you ran back to give  them their change. The cash register was inside. You had to go in to tally  the deal up. That was full service.  Well, they don   t have it now, do they?  No.  Of course, in Long Beach it was close to the beach, and there was  always a fine layer of sand on the sidewalk and on the pavement. I   d  wear out a pair of shoes every two weeks, wear the soles out. I had a pair  of GI shoes, and I thought,    Well, these will last,    and they didn   t last  any longer. That sand when you   re running and walking, it just     It   s like sandpaper.  Yes. Then we had to mop the drives and the lube bay three times a day.  The restrooms had to be cleaned three times a day, all that stuff, and  they were out to do business. The guy that owned all of them, Harold  Parks, he didn   t have any kids, but he was a multimillionaire. He started  out   he put in a service station, and there was a gas line that run  underneath his service station. He dug it out and tapped into it and was  selling somebody else   s gas. (Laughter)  That   s the reason he had twelve. (Laughs)  That   s where he made all his money. Then when he started hauling it  from there over to another station he built, they had a greater loss on the  line than they knew should be, so they started investigating and found  out what he was doing. By then he was started. He had his own trucks  3 8  Nykolaiszyn  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  Nykolaiszyn  Billy  that went to the refinery and got the gas and brought it out and put it in  the tanks. It was a pretty big operation for them at that time.  When your brother decided to come back to Oklahoma and you came on  back, too, did you have any idea what you were going to do?  We were going to farm. I was going to help Dad, but Dad had got bit by  a spider and was having a terrible time with his knee and couldn   t hardly  get around. I was going to come back and help him with the harvest, and  then her dad had said that he was getting about ready to retire. Then the  social security thing come along, and they couldn   t retire until they had  two or three more years into social security so they could draw, not the  maximum but they could draw more. Her uncle got killed in a car wreck  where the old town of Jet was, and they didn   t have anybody to farm  that, so they rented that to us. Then the place that we   d put soil back  came out, and I farmed it. I had those two places to farm. Then after her  dad did retire, then we farmed more of the ground that he farmed. I  guess we decided we was going to farm whether we     Whether we could make it or not.     whether we made any money or not.  The kids always was raised on the farm, and I wouldn   t trade that for  nothing.  You know, it was different then than it is now. If one of our neighbors  had a problem and needed help, Dad would say,    Why don   t you boys  go down and help Frank?    or,    Go up and help John.    We didn   t expect  any pay. We just was neighbors, and we   d go help them. Almost every  year there was one of the neighbors somewhere that needed help, and  we   d go help them. When her dad had trouble with his back and couldn   t  do their chores, Dad said,    Boys, go over there and help Buck with the  chores and see if you can help out over there.    It   s just one of those  deals that everybody was neighborly and tried to help.  Do you know your neighbors today?  Just got one.  That   s all there are. (Laughs)  How has that changed through the years? Did there used to be a lot  more?  Bigger farming, and people started coming in from other areas and  3 9  Bonnie  Billy  Nykolaiszyn  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  renting ground. Used to be, if a place was going to sale or a renter was  going to leave the farm with somebody, they needed somebody else to  farm it, it was kind of,    Well, so and so ought to have that. They   re right  there next to it. They   ve always been good neighbors.    Now it isn   t that  away. It   s whoever has got the most money is going to get it. The people  that live there don   t live around here anymore, the people that own the  land. I was talking to an attorney, I don   t know, four or five years ago,  and he said in Cherokee there was over three million dollars that went  out of Cherokee that day out of the banks.  There were two estates that had been settled, and the kids lived on the  East Coast and the West Coast. They sold the land and took the money  out of the bank, and that   s what   s happened to all the small  communities. The money that was available in the area to be loaned out  for farming has all went to the East Coast and the West Coast because  that   s where the heirs are. Then one of the ladies over at FSA  Farm  Service Agency  (used to be the ASCS  Agricultural Stabilization and  Conservation Service ) office, she said they have people call and say,     What do I need to know about this farm program?    When they try to  tell them, it   s,    I don   t want to mess with it. I think I   ll just sell it,    or,     Do you know somebody that might want to rent it?    They don   t want  anything. They don   t     Don   t want to mess with it.     want to be involved in it. Some of them don   t particularly want to sell  it, but they will because they just don   t want to be involved in it.  How do you keep up with farm programs today?  If something   s on the internet, she   ll tell me, and I   ll go read it. I don   t  spend much time on the internet, but she does. (Laughs)  Well, they send on the internet. They send it out now on the internet.  Yes, all the farm offices are on the internet, and you can go in and pull it  up and see what their last program was or the last newsletter they sent  out. They post the newsletters on the internet, I think the High Plains  Journal and several other farm magazines. When I was in high school I  used to go to Tulsa to the fair and stock show. Of course, you know,  when you   re in high school, you   re pretty important. Little red-headed  newspaper boy come along, and he said,    Paper, Mister?    I said,    No, I  can   t read.    He said,    Well, put one under your arm. You won   t look so  damn dumb.    (Laughter) He had a answer for everything. While I   d be  over there at the fair, they always had a cane. The Tulsa state fair  marked on the cane. If you subscribed a new subscription to a farm  4 0  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  magazine, they   d give you one of those canes. I think I had about a  hundred years    of subscriptions by the time I got out of high school for  The Progressive Farmer or Farm and Ranch, one of those. Finally they  started sending us another magazine so they could use up that prepaid  subscription. It was two dollars, and I   d get a cane.  How many canes did you     He had a lot. (Laughter)  I still got two or three of them canes around here somewhere.  Hope you don   t need them. (Laughs)  Yes, I do too. I give a lot of them away.  So do you keep up with the weather through the Mesonet or some other  source?  Usually on the television. A lot of them   s got it on their phone and they  can pull it up, but it   s usually changed by the time they pull it up. It   s  hard to predict weather in this area because of the Rocky Mountains.  The storms come over the mountains, and then they go up or down or  whatever. They don   t know where they   re going to go.  So social security coming in in the   60s was a pretty big deal for  farmers?  Yes.  We haven   t had too many people talk about that aspect. Is there  anything else you remember from that?  I remember that a lot of the first ones that started drawing their social  security only paid the maximum in one year, and they   d do the  maximum at that time. Of course, the maximum was higher than that  now. Dad   s social security was pretty good because he had worked for  the State Highway Department for four years, and then when they built  the air base up here, he worked up there. He had made a contribution  into the social security system, so his social security was pretty good  when he started drawing. Now, her dad was like we were. They didn   t  pay in too much. It was a thing, that a lot of farmers wouldn   t pay in the  social security.    It won   t be there when I get ready for it.    It   s a  government program. It   s not going to work.    That kind of deal. They  didn   t pay in if they didn   t have to, and then when it come time to draw,  they didn   t draw much, either.  4 1  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Bonnie  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  I guess it was the Medicare that came along with it that they benefited  the most from?  Yes, right.  Yes.  Then her granddad on the other side, her dad   s dad, they didn   t know he  existed. He never paid income tax. He never signed up for     Nothing.     anything, but he was chairman of the county democrats, and he was  chairman of the election board, and he was on the federal land bank  board. He did all that and never had a social security number, never paid  taxes.  I don   t know how he did it.  They didn   t know he existed, I guess, but he was on all those other  things.  Never made a great deal of money, either, then, I guess?  No.  No, probably not.  They had a big family, and he was a horse trader and did a lot of  different things.  He was one of his kind.  I think he had some money of his own by the time he retired because  they always had a car and then they moved to town.  I have to tell her about Grandpa. He drank a lot. He   d go into town and  come back     He   d sit at the pool hall all day and drink beer. I don   t care how big a  man or how tough you are, after a while, it affects you. (Laughter) He  didn   t think so, but it did. So he left there one time and went home.  At night.  4 2  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Nykolaiszyn  Billy  Nykolaiszyn  Billy  Oh, yes, sometimes he   d stay all day and get in a Pitch game up to the  pool hall and wouldn   t want to leave. Might   ve won a hand or two, so he  wanted to stay until he spent that. Anyway, when he went home, they  lived four miles out of town, four or five. His son rented a place right  north of town, and when he left, he got over in the ditch and up in the  fence, tore out the fence between two telephone poles, and then missed  the telephone poles, went back, and tore up some more fence. His son  went out the next morning, and he stopped at the house.  He said,    Dad, was that you that went through my fence? The cattle   s  out.       No, Lad, that wasn   t me.    (Laughter) He said,    Well, I know it  was because the wire   s still out to the driveway where you drove in.     They had a granary there, and he had a ladder, and he always drove  astraddle of the ladder. Well, when he did, all that wire under his car  hooked the ladder and shoved it right out through the north side of the  granary. (Laughter) He said,    Now, that was over on Vickers    side of the  road that I hit that fence. It wasn   t yours,    but he had all the fence under  his car. Made it home. (Laughs) When he got out of the car he tripped on  the wire and fell down. He didn   t get into the fence on that side.  But that   s on my dad   s side.  I don   t know. He would take Grandma to town with him a lot of days,  and he   d go to the pool hall. She   d buy her groceries, and they   d box it  up for her, and then they   s supposed to pick it up before they went  home. She   d go down, and sit in the car the rest of the day     All day.     all day long. People would come stop and talk to her and visit with  her, but he   d leave her sitting there in that car. It was a different world, I  guess. (Laughter) That   s the way he grew up, and I guess that   s what he  thought he was supposed to do.  Well, today how many acres are you farming?  Fifteen hundred.  Okay, and for each of you, could you just take me through a typical day  on the farm?  Well, we get up and eat breakfast, and then we just go from there.  Whatever needs to be done, that   s   . If I   m in the field, I   ll go to the  field and work ground. A lot of the younger ones anymore they don   t  have any regular routine as far as eating breakfast. We always called it  dinner and supper, but now it   s lunch and dinner. We still eat three  4 3  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Nykolaiszyn  Billy  Bonnie  meals a day and on our time of when morning and noon and supper is.  The kids all, they want to wait until two o   clock to eat lunch, or they  don   t want to eat at all. It was always important to her family and it was  important to my family that we be at the table when the meal   s ready,  and Dad made sure. He said,    Now, if your mother   s going to get up and  fix breakfast, you   re going to be in there to eat it. If your mother   s going  to fix dinner, you   re going to be there to eat it. She goes to all that work,  and you don   t feel like eating or you don   t want to do this, you don   t  want to, you   re going to be there. If you don   t eat, you   re going to sit  there.    Her folks were the same way.  I think it   s important to sit at a table as a family.  Then you can visit. Like our daughter, when her kids all come home,  there   s a basket there by the door, and their cell phones go in that basket.  We   re going to visit, and we   re going to be here as a family. Pick that  phone up when you leave instead of all of them sitting around the  table     I think, too, you know, of course, I   ve never had to work away from  home. I did work in the insurance company. I take that back, now. I had  my shop. I think it   s important, and always have been, if I have to go to  Enid to get groceries or pick up something, I always make a practice that  I   ll either have his dinner ready where he can have it when he comes in  from the field, or I   ll try to make it home by that time.  If you   d go to the doctor or something, tell me you   re going to be a little  bit late because I don   t go with you.  I always feel like we try to be on not a real strict schedule but some form  that he knows where I   m at and I know where he   s at. We usually get up  about six in the morning. It   s just pretty much a day like that.  How late do you stay working in the field?  Oh, I used to work until ten or eleven o   clock at night, but I   ll be in by  six thirty or seven now. The older you get, (and I   m getting there) sitting  in the tractor all day without getting out and walking around is bad for  your circulation. I have trouble with my feet swelling, and I had to start  wearing compression socks. I   ve kind of learned to stop once in a while  and get out and walk around. I used to sit in the tractor fourteen, sixteen  hours a day, would stop for lunch. Same way with the combine. I don   t  do that anymore, and I shouldn   t have done it back then. I think my  circulation probably would have been better.  I always try to do the mowing because he really don   t have time.  4 4  Finchum  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Yesterday morning I got on the mower about nine, and I didn   t get off of  it until four o   clock. (Laughs) It just seems like the yard gets bigger.  That was the hottest day of the year.  Yes, but I always like to have my grass mowed, and I do that. There   s  such a few moments of our life, anymore. We can   t work like we used  to. We   ve got some buildings we want to take down, and I want to take  my patio out because it   s in bad shape. We just work a little at a time on  that because I can   t do it all when I want to. Anyway, we just kind of  plug along.  What do you see happening for the next one hundred years for the farm?  What do you hope?  Oh, I hope that my generations keeps it going.  Something has to change from where we   re headed now. Everything is  big business now. Big business controls everything. Something   s got to  happen or we   re going to run out of food. It was all the hundreds of  thousands of hands that built all this country that can   t let it get in  control of one or two big companies.  Because food will just keep going up.  I would say we   re becoming more like the Romans. We want more time  off for leisure than we spend working, and that was what ended their  dynasty.  But you know what? I think a lot of it may not have a thing   but these  mini-marts. People can   t survive unless they go up to the mini-mart and  hit happy hour or just sit and listen to gossip and all that. To me that is,  it   s just not important.  You buy a car now according how many cup holders there is (Laughter)  instead of what the mileage is or how comfortable it is.  Or phone chargers.  Yes.  Yes.  A place to plug in your phone charger.  To me, I mean, we   re just not people to go to town and go to the co-op  4 5  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  and sit and see what   s the gossip. Used to be a farmer here that  everybody said he   d grab the Enid paper first thing and see who was in  the obituary column, so if anybody he knew, he could go ask them to  rent their land. That was just what he did.  Well, it was just kind of a standard joke in the community.  Yes, and he did. He rented a lot of land.  But after some of the ones that start coming in from other areas and  more people moved off of the farm, it began to change. It wasn   t the  same community it used to be.  Well, in the little town of Jet, my gosh, I bet there   s 90 percent of the  people I don   t even know who they are anymore that   s moved in. The  town don   t mean anything to those kind of people. It   s the people that   s  had their roots here for years, you know, that really means something to  them. It   s just like that house uptown that I had the shop. That was Aunt  Vera and Uncle Ray   s, and us girls used to spend   they always had  water in town. We didn   t have water where we lived. Dad and Mom had  to haul water. They   d buy us bathing suits, and we   d go in there and run  and play in the sprinkler. Things like that I can remember, and they were  important to people. Now, I don   t know. I doesn   t mean nothing. We  tried to, Bill and I, with the old bank building up there, and it   s still  standing. We done everything in our power. We went and had guys  come in from      Fort Scott.     Fort Scott to estimate how much it would take to redo it. We was  going to get grants to help pay for it, and we just done a lot of leg work.  Do you know every time they   d say,    I don   t know why you want to  save that for. It   s not worth it.        Why don   t just tear it down?     Just tear it down.    You know, things like that, that we tried to do things  for the town of Jet and don   t mean anything.  Well, not to the ones now.  Now, no.  And then drugs.  Oh, yes.  4 6  Billy  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Drugs is terrible.  In this small town?  Yes. We   ve got one guy that   s been in drugs ever since he was in high  school, and he   s already killed somebody. The building burned. He   s  burned two other buildings.  He   s burned three buildings and had one guy that worked for him die in  a fire. It was a meth lab.  And they have not done one thing to him.  He always said,    I don   t have to worry about the sheriff. I give him  enough money, he ain   t going to bother me.     They got a new sheriff now. We   re going to see if it makes a difference.  Do you envision yourself staying here until the very end?  Oh, yes.  And have you got things in place for who gets it next?  No, we   ve talked     We have a trust that has a     Irrevocable trust.     automatic hand down to the next generation.  Now personal things, I   ve got to mark things and do that. It   s hard to do.  It   s very hard.  It is very hard to do.  I told her, I said,    Well, the best way to do that is just give it to them  while you   re still living, and then you know they got it, and they   re not  going to fight over it.  But none of them, now, have a place to put it. Our oldest son, his wife  don   t care to hoot and a holler about any of his things, and so she can  throw out more than     4 7  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  She don   t care a whole lot about her family   s things.  No, and Gib, he has his Grandpa Nelson   s old railroad watch, and his  mother give it to him when he was fifty years old. Gib   s named after  him, so Billy said,    I   d like to give it to him.    Well, if we did, it  wouldn   t mean nothing to her.  She   d either sell it or throw it away, and he   d let her.  So you   ve got that problem, and we   ve got a daughter that doesn   t throw  away nothing. She just wants everything. Then our son, he likes history,  and he likes family heirlooms. This Hoosier cabinet we got was my  Grandma Hopkins    that came in a covered wagon from Missouri. Mom  and Dad gave it to me, and we had it redone. Well, there   s two that  wants it, so, you know, it   s hard. I give it to him, and I could leave the  old world where I didn   t have to hear them fight, (Laughter) that would  be fine with me.  A lot of the stuff we   ve got was family   d say,    Would you haul that off  for us?       Well, yes, I   ll haul it off, but we   ll haul it to my place.       I  don   t care what you do with it. Take it down to the creek. Do whatever  you want to with it. Just get it out of here        So we   ve, you know, got things like that.     so we just take it. That one table that   s in there, when they sold her  granddad   s place, they said,    Would you haul that table out and take it  down to the creek?    I said,    Well, I   ll take it home. I   m not going to  haul it to the creek.       I don   t care what you do with it. Just get it out of  here,    so we brought it home. We had her other grandpa   s wagon out  there in the barn, so I just turned it upside down on that wagon and had it  out there for seven or eight years, probably. One day she said,    Would  you get that table down for me? I think I   m going to refinish it.    I said,     Yes, where do you want it?    She said,    Well, just put it in the driveway  of the granary, and I   ll work on it out there.     I did, and then before she refinished it   her uncle did carpentry work,  had a router. I borrowed his router, and I run around the edge of it to  smooth it all up so it wouldn   t have splinters. She refinished it. She got it  all refinished, and when we brought it in the house everybody   d come  and say,    That looks like Grandpa and Grandma   s table. Where did you  get it?       Well, we was up to the sale, and they wanted to get rid of it, so  we brought it up here.       Wish I   d have known that.    Well, they didn   t  see it like it was before she refinished it.  4 8  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  So the solution in those days was to take it to the creek?  Yes.  Yes.  If you didn   t want something, you took it to the creek.  Those platters and stuff   this uncle that was a carpenter, he married a  German family   s daughter, and they lived over on the creek. They told  him to get rid of all them old platters and stuff, said,    The ones that we  brought from Germany, nobody wants them. Just haul them down to the  creek and dump them.    So he did, and then he come by, and he had the  silverware. He said,    You kids want this silverware?       Yes, I want it      So we took it, and he said,    I hauled a bunch of other stuff down to the  creek. I don   t know whether it all got broke or not.    The next day he  come by, and he had three or four of them platters and some dishes. He  said,    These didn   t get broke, so I dug them out of the creek where I  threw that other stuff.     I told him,    Where   d you throw it? I   ll go over and dig that stuff out and  see if there   s anything else.    He never would tell me where he throwed  it. (Laughs) He didn   t want me over there digging around. I guess he   d  hauled other stuff out there, and he didn   t want me digging. Then the  place her sister got, her uncle lived there before that, and they had a  trash dump on it. We was over there one time digging around in that  trash dump   down through there and found a whole bunch of old, like,  homebrew bottles that had the cork deal in them and the wire bale, and  you pull the wire bale down to seal the cork. We found a bunch of them  with stuff they   d thrown away years and years ago.  It wasn   t important to them.  No, they wanted to get rid of it. They wanted something new. It   s  scattered all over the country. I found this deal  vulcanizing solution  bottle  here about a year and a half, two years ago out in the field...  Out in the field. (Laughs)     where a house used to be, but it   s still in pretty good shape for  however long it   s been there. They used to vulcanize tires, and that was  a solution that they used to glue the tires together, but how it escaped  machinery, yes.  Cool.  4 9  Bonnie  Billy  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  A lot of people used to find those dumps and shoot targets and see if  they could hit them. A lot of the stuff got broke that way.  I had a brother that was a master at that, throwing stuff in the air and  shooting it. We had a football Dad got us for Christmas one year.  Neighbor kids was there, and they   d been hunting, and one of them said,     Throw that ball up in the air, and I   ll see if I can hit it.    They said,     You   re not going to do that.    He said,    Throw it up there. I   ll show  you.    They threw that football up in the air, and he shot a hole right  through it. (Laughter)  Were holidays fun back in this room years and years ago?  It was. We used to have a lot of fun.  We used to play cards.  Yes, and Billy   s sister and brother and then his brother that used to  come, they   d all come over. We might play cards all night long.  Two or three o   clock in the morning, and then we   d get up at four thirty,  five o   clock in the morning and go milk the cows and do chores, but  they didn   t have any of that to do.  We milked. When we come out in California, I don   t know how many  milk cows we started so we could have cream to sell and have that.  We started out with ten.  Ten. Billy fixed the barn down there so we could have   but we carried  all that milk up here, suffering. (Laughs) Anyway, to make the story  short, we   d take the kids down. We couldn   t leave them in the house  because we milked by hand. Our daughter, I mean, if she wasn   t a pistol.  She didn   t like any part of this because we set them up on the     Feed barrel.     feed barrel. It   d take a while to milk by hand, and that was a story in  itself just to keep the kids satisfied. Anyway, when she got a little older,  we decided we might just leave her up at the house and I   d just come up  every little bit and check on her. My Lord, she had every pot and pan in  this house out of the cabinet. Let me tell you, I didn   t do that no more.  (Laughter) But anyway, we used to milk and that   d help supplement  buying our groceries, and then we   d have our cows as an asset. We done  that, then we got milkers. My dad had milkers, electric milkers, and we  got them. Used to have milkers that we could milk. Instead of by hand,  5 0  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  we used the milkers. He   d go buy little pigs at the sale, and then we   d  feed them the whole milk after we separated it because you had to get  rid of it someway. I went out there one evening, and they were gone.  Them pigs were gone, and we looked and looked and looked for them  pigs. Finally, about how many months went by?  Three or four months.  Three or four months went by, and they came across the pasture and was  in the pen when we separated that night. They had been over on our  neighbors   , north, down in his milo.  Yes, and when he cut the milo he said,    I can tell you where your pigs  were at.     They were big   They had nests. Yes, they were big enough for market when they came  back, but he said they had dug out, rooted out, nests over there in that  milo. It was by the creek. They had water, so they stayed over there.  In the meantime, he went back and bought some more little pigs, so we  could have it for the milk. That   s an experience. We did do that, and  then we had a huge garden. The guy that we did our grocery trading,  he   d buy onions, potatoes, tomatoes. Then I had people come to the  house and bought out of the garden.  Did you do chickens?  Yes, we raised chickens, dressed chickens. In the spring   s when we  usually dressed our chickens. I   d have over 125, 150 in the freezer, and  that fed the family. That   s about all the meat we had.  We had chicken until the next spring when we   d get the next bunch.  When we come from California, though, we didn   t have nothing. We  were out of debt, then. That   s about all I could say. He   d kill some  rabbits, and I   d fix rabbit for a meal. I didn   t care for it, but it was better  than nothing.  Did you have a method for killing your chickens?  How we did it?  Yes.  5 1  Billy  Finchum  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  We   d step on their neck and pull their neck and let them flop. Then we   d  scald them and pick the feathers and singe them and     And then cut them up.     cut them up.  But you can   t do that anymore, do you?  No.  Would you do what we call the pulley bone part?  Yes, the wishbone?  Yes. You can   t find those anymore, either.  No.  No.  They   re already cut in two.  They don   t cut them that way anymore.  They don   t. It   s different. We used to cut them up and then it got where  one time I did them by myself. His mother was real good to come over.  I   d help her with her chickens, and then we   d come over, and she   d help  me. Once in a while, maybe something should happen that she didn   t get  to come. I   d dress a hundred a day.  That   s a lot of work, too, isn   t it?  That was a lot of work.  We   d sell some to help pay the cost of raising the ones we kept. We   d  sell them for a dollar apiece, dressed.  Then there was a place up at Wakita that this lady had a   I mean, you   d  take them up there, and then she would dress them. She had a picker. Of  course, when she killed them she   d stick them down in funnels until they  quit kicking and then dipped them in a scalding vat, but she had a picker  that had little rubber pickers on it.  It   d turn.  5 2  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Bonnie  Billy  Bonnie  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Bonnie  It   d turn real fast, and it   d get the feathers off. We used to do that. Back  then, it didn   t really   like, ten cents a chicken or fifteen, and it got  where we did take them up there and let her do them.  Ten cents for her to do it.  That didn   t last long. Then they got where I suppose they couldn   t get  rid of the feathers or maybe     Probably some regulation.     yes, that kept them from doing it.  Regulations changed the dairy business, too.  Oh, yes, a lot.  Oh, that was terrible. We had some neighbors that was in the dairy  business that sold the milk instead of the cream. They was always  having to either put in more windows or take windows out and close  them up and change the ways the barn was. Constantly they was having  to change their barn to fit the new regulation. They   d do it, but it finally  got them.  Took care of them.  We   ve covered quite a bit of ground today. Is there anything else you  want to add before we close out?  Well, we have the original patent and land grant that her grandpa got.  We can look at those when we shut off. Well, if there isn   t, thank you  very much for sharing. It   s been a pleasure.  Seems like we haven   t done much, but covered enough territory that     We   ve covered quite a bit, so thank you very much.  You   re welcome.  -------  -------
