Speaker 1: Okay, now, was he a DuBois or was he named after William Edward Burghardt DuBois [W.E.B. Du Bois], or was he?

Story_ID: 284403
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask as kind of a warm up and the first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy, truth or tell--my favorite food is food.  I, I love food period.  I don't know about a favorite, you know I love steaks and I love lobsters, I love chicken.  I just love fish in general and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Love the--I was in New Orleans [Louisiana] for twenty-two and a half years so I have a great love for seafood and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay, and.
Speaker 2: But that's the favorite food itself that-I, I don't have a favorite per se.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I have a variety of favorites.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: No, well I (laughter), I like black and white with all the symbolism I suppose, but I also like brown, but that has no deep significance for me really you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy this is a--you know I like spring with all of its heavy symbolism of the rebirth and new birth, but I also like fall, change of the season and its symbolism.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, I, I suppose my favorite method is the cruise.  It doesn't have to be a single place, my wife [Sylvia F. Cook] and I have been all over the Caribbean.  We've been on two or three cruises to Alaska, we loved all of them, and that's why I loved vacation, get away from-I, I love the water, but to get away from, what I used to call, the tearing of the telephone, commune with nature and see the water, sky, continuity of the water and the sky just awesome for me you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well (unclear) I have several, which are not mine, I guess it came from Dr. [Benjamin] Mays, my great mentor, at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and throughout my life about novel striving, great expectations and aspirations and things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you remember one of them?
Speaker 2: Oh, I can remember a variety, a variety (laughter) of them that-about aiming high and reaching for the stars.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Burning the midnight oil.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Giving life your best shot.
Story_ID: 284404
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask you about your family history (background noise) and I'm going to ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Emanuel Cook] side of the family, but first I'll ask about your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's first name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's first name was Mary, M-A-R-Y, Beatrice, B-E-A-T-R-I-C-E, Daniel, her maiden name, and D-A-N-I-E-L, and of course then, Cook.
Speaker 1: All right and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Talbot County [Georgia] and, and was born on Christmas Day, but I'm not sure of the year.  I'm sure it was in the 18--before--sort of about 1890 something, but I'm not sure.  I just don't recall a number yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, well that's close, that's you know that's all right.  Now, what do you about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back in history can you trace those ancestors?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew my only grandmother and grandfather on my mother's side.  I don't know any of the great-grands, I just don't have any knowledge or experience.  I know very little about my family tree.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your grandparents didn't talk about the family history much or anything or?
Speaker 2: Well, we are very small; they, they died when I was a very small kid, so I just, just don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, are there any stories that are passed down about what your ancestors were doing in Georgia back in 19th century?
Speaker 2: Well, just as farmers, or sharecroppers working throughout the year to make ends meet, that's on my mother's side and so forth.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: On my father's side.
Speaker 1: Now, wait I don't want to get to him yet, but.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, okay, okay yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But on your mother's side are there any stories about, you know 'cause she was born in the 1890s, that's like I imagine her mother was probably born either during slavery or right after slavery?
Speaker 2: Around--yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did they have any stories about slavery, Civil War, or any of that or Reconstruction or?
Speaker 2: I--the you know I actually here as a kid, remember I was a very small kid when my grandmother, my maternal grandmother died.  I'd hear stories about the [Ku Klux] Klan [KKK] and terrorism and the fears that blacks had in those days, and how racism dehumanized blacks and how whites took land, just thousands and thousands, I guess millions really acres of land from blacks at the time.  So the, the story, as I remember from a kid, hearing my grandmother and grandfather talk was that with the end of Reconstruction, they had a hard time, 'cause they had a hard time during Reconstruction, of course, because it was right after slavery--didn't have the means to do anything. In poverty, just worked hard from sun up to sun down.  So life was, was rough, terrifying in a profound sense and black life was cheap, but after all that's the nature of racism, to make black life cheap.  So that you know, tidbits I picked up from my great, from my grandparents and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay, are there any specific stories about things that happened to members of your family that have passed down from that time?
Speaker 2: Well, stories about how the land was taken from them--
Speaker 1: How, well how did they say it was taken?
Speaker 2: --and their--.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, how do they say it was taken?
Speaker 2: Well, there was never any you know comprehensive statement, they just said whites took the land from them, and my guess is it was through various kind of chicanery in terms of--I, I don't know whether the loans or what have you, I just know how, but they say they just took the land from them.
Story_ID: 284405
Speaker 1: Did you mother [Mary Daniel Cook] talk about growing up in Talbot County [Georgia] and what it was like for her?
Speaker 2: Ah yes, my mother talked about it, growing up, struggling to get an education in Talbot County in Woodland, Georgia and how her parents revered education and sent her away to what they called then, boarding school, in Cordele, Georgia.  I've forgotten the name of the academy that--you know, in the post-Reconstruction era there were a lot of academies throughout the, out the South trying to provide education for blacks.  And when she finished there, she went to what became Fort Valley State College [Fort Valley High and Industrial School; Fort Valley State University, Fort Valley, Georgia]. Fort Valley College and was private to begin with and became a state institution, and a four-year institution I think when she went there.  She went to high school there under where the legendary Dr. H.L. Hunt, H-O-N-T [sic. Dr. H.A. Hunt].
Speaker 1: H H-O-N-T?
Speaker 2: Hunt.
Speaker 1: H-U-N-T?
Speaker 2: H.L. Hunt.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you spelled the last name, is it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) H-U-N-T.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right just the way you would normally spell Hunt okay.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And she got a certificate, not a degree, but a certificate in those days and taught school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she became a teacher?
Speaker 2: A, yeah a teacher, a school teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay and did she teach in Talbot County mainly or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in Talbot County.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Woodland, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay, you remember any of the names of the schools where she taught at?
Speaker 2: No, I don't, I don't, I don't recall.
Speaker 1: Okay, um, now well, how many people, did she come from a large family or a small family?
Speaker 2: Large family, I remember two or three of her brothers and sisters; a pretty, pretty large family, pretty large family.
Speaker 1: Okay, and they were basically farmers.
Speaker 2: Yeah, basically farmers, yeah.
Speaker 1: Farm family?  Okay.
Speaker 2: But somehow they eked out a living and got some education.  Education was valued.
Story_ID: 284406
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's name--my father was a Baptist minister.  His name is Reverend M.E.--initials, C-O-O-K and the M was for Manuel which was short for Emanuel Cook.
Speaker 1: Okay, and all right, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Well he, he too was born in Talbot County [Georgia] and the day he was born in the 1890s too, but I, I don't recall the year, but in the 1890s, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side, the Cook side, of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well, again, I did not know my grandmother and grandfather on my, on my dad's side.  I knew uncles, they died pretty early apparently, but when I was growing up in Griffin, Georgia, I just, just didn't know my grandparents on my father's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I knew the--my uncles and I knew my aunts, but not, not my grandparents on my father's side.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you--
Speaker 2: You know, they died before you know, even before I was born or before I developed (laughter) any kind of consciousness.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, what I mean though is do you have any stories about your ancestors, you wouldn't necessarily have to know them but how far back, I mean do people talk about the ancestors?  How far back do they go that you know of and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Oh well on my father's side, I--my, my great-grandfather, I guess, was a minister, almost everybody was a minister on my father's side, that was a great tradition and the pastor of the churches.
Speaker 1: What denomination were they?
Speaker 2: Baptist.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Missionary Baptist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Pastor of the church down in Meriwether County [Georgia] and Talbot County, Woodland, Georgia in, in that area.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Woodland, Meriwether, they're all what part of Talbot?
Speaker 2: Talbot County, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay are there any stories about slavery or Reconstruction that come down through your father's side?  Are they the same kind of stories?  Was--did they have land taken from them too or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, land taken from them and so forth.  I said most of 'em were ministers and they were very sensitive about it and so forth.  But, you know, the same kind of terror and fear of the [Ku Klux] Klan [KKK] on my father's side.
Speaker 1: Did they talk about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was the same kind of dehumanization what they-you know.
Speaker 1: Did they talk about lynching and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes--oh, yeah, oh yes, that's a common practice.
Speaker 1: Okay in Talbot County and such?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yeah, Meriwether County down there and so forth--night riders and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay so you come from a long line of ministers on your father's side?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's correct, that's right.
Speaker 1: The ministers are often like the community leaders and they provide leadership for the community.  Did they ever get in any spots where they were-they had to make some crucial decision about what the community was going to do or step in and try to save someone or?
Speaker 2: I don't recall any stories about that, I, I just don't.  No I, I don't recall any stories that were handed down.  It's with my father's generation that's--in the ministry, now that's what I, I remember a great deal and discussions about education, about leadership.  I had on my father's side--my father had two brothers who were ministers and who left Talbot County at a fairly young age and became ministers and steel workers in Alabama.  They were not full time ministry work you know, had to work in steel mills and so forth in Alabama, Westfield and Fairfield, Alabama.
Story_ID: 284407
Speaker 1: Now, did your father [Emanuel Cook] talk about growing up?  What it was like for him to grow up in Talbot County [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was rough as to my mother [Mary Daniel Cook] and other blacks of that generation.  Eking out a living was difficult, they lived in fear and terror.  They had to remember and court that place to survive.  They, they had to struggle and so forth, they were poor.  As [W.E.B.] Du Bois say you know it's, "To be poor is always bad but to be poor in a land of dollars is infinitely bad," you know and so they were the poor.  They, they eked out a living and tried to maintain a certain sense of dignity and.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did your father have a chance to go to school?
Speaker 2: Yes, my father went to, what was called--he lived in Talbot County--went to a school called Central City College in Macon, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now Central City College was not really, not even a first class high school, but had the name college as so many institutions of that era.  You know Dr. [Benjamin] Mays talked about the dying faith to call these institutions colleges and some of them even universities and so forth but it was an expression of hope and affirmation and all that.  So my dad went to Central City College, but the amazing thing about my, my father in terms of education, he had a great passion for education.  That was--he thought that education was the, the keys to life, the good life and had that, that great passion for education, and not merely education, but higher education and so forth and one of the most vivid memories of my own, own life--my dad talked so much about education and talked about the, the bottom floor is always crowded, room on the top.  You've gotta strive for higher, higher things.  He, he influenced me so much, I remember one of my teachers saying to me that when I was in middle school in Griffin, Georgia that I once wrote my name [HistoryMaker] Samuel DuBois Cook, A.B., A.M., Ph.D., and before I was twenty-five I had my Ph.D., but I was influenced on a large part by my parents, primarily my father, who didn't have a college degree, but had that passion.  As I indicated earlier, you know one of the really amazing things about blacks and the Reconstruction, post-Reconstruction era, and in the '90s [1890s] they had that great passion for education and Du Bois had written about it and (unclear).
Speaker 1: Right, there is a conflict--I know there are two opposing views, of course, they're famous now, Du Bois point of view about higher education and Booker T. Washington's industrial education model.  It seems as though your father was a follower of Dr. Du Bois' model as opposed with--?
Speaker 2: No question about it, no, no question about it.  But that passion for education was just, just there.
Speaker 1: Now did he have any heroes in terms of that?  Did he idolize Dr. Du Bois or any of the others, Dr. William [H.] Ferris, any of the other people, black scholars from those days?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't, I don't recall his black heroes in terms of education that he idolized other than ministers, L.K. Williams and people like that, a great minister in Augusta, Georgia--I forgot his name at the moment, but he you know, we were exposed to books, social research books and exposed to some of the boys and all that, and, of course, Booker T. Washington and, but I do not recall in growing up in Griffin any of the celebrated heroes of my dad intellectually and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 284408
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Mary Daniel Cook and Emanuel Cook] met? Do they tell a story of how they met?
Speaker 2: I, I don't recall how they met, no, no.  I, you know I used to talk about when they were courting in Woodland in Talbot County [Georgia] and so forth, going to church and you know all this business, but in terms of how they met, I, I don't know.  I don't recall them saying to me how they met.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did they have an eventful courtship?  I mean is there a story there (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) They, they didn't tell me much about that (laughter).  Dancing was forbidden in those days I guess for ministers and so forth and the children, so they didn't dance as much, but they courted, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's hard to imagine now that dancing was forbidden, you know and among Baptist ministers, but that was the case then, you didn't dance in missionary Baptist church?
Speaker 2: It's, no it's not just, it's not surprising at all being many of them were, well Puritan in affect you know--that dancing involved a lot of fun-you know you're not supposed to have a lot of fun and so forth.  You know it's hard to believe but my great mentor and idol and benefactor, Dr. Benjamin Mays while teaching in Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] in the early 1920s was also a pastor, of Shiloh Baptist Church here in Atlanta [Georgia]. He took--not only took a young lady to a dance but he danced with her and Shiloh Baptist Church fired him.
Speaker 1: That's quite story, I had heard that before.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, fun.  He took a lady to a dance and there were Baptists preachers you know who were in Atlanta, close to Morehouse who sought to dancing but was terrible, sinful, as the Puritans taught.  I mean that's what the Puritans taught that dancing was sinful.  When I was a student at Morehouse, I remember the name a man, the name W.F. Paschal, very outstanding, very prominent minister in Atlanta and in Georgia, very influential, saying to us at Morehouse College students, that, that dancing was bad, it was immoral and he said to us, he said, "You dance with these girls, you get close to them, something is going to happen," that's what he said, "you get close to them."  Of course we fell out and he didn't think it was funny at all (laughter).  We laughed at him you know, he said, "When you get in the way," he said "you get close to them, you know," other than dancing and so forth, "something is going to happen."  The guys just cracked up and he was upset by us laughing at him, but his name was Reverend Dr. W.F. Paschal.  I will never forget him.
Speaker 1: Is he related to the Paschals that own the Paschal Motor Lodge [Paschal's Restaurant, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: No, I'm not, I don't know, I don't think so.
Story_ID: 284452
Speaker 1: So we were talking about the admonishment by the--about dancing, right (laughter)?
Speaker 2: About dancing, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Something's gonna to happen if you--
Speaker 2: Something is going to happen and so forth he [Reverend Dr. W.F. Paschal] said and but that was but dancing, they don't want you to have any fun.
Speaker 1: Now was that.
Speaker 2: That's why card playing was forbidden by the Puritans and so forth.
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned the Puritans, are you actually--was there as an influence from the North in terms of--I know a lot of the northern clergy came south to establish schools and so forth in the South.  Are you talking about that kind of influence from northern ministers or being at the root of this or do you think it's a southern thing, or or, or was here already?
Speaker 2: It's not a southern, it started in New England the Puritan and then down here because when it got down south, it got even worse, I suppose you know in a sense and so forth.  And it was combined with other things including the racism and so forth.  But I really had referenced to the, the great Puritans in New England, Cotton Mathe- Mather [Cotton Mather] and people like that and so forth.
Speaker 1: Kind of laid the foundation?
Speaker 2: Yeah, laid the foundation and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's why you had the blue laws, you closed the stores on Sundays, you didn't open stores on Sundays, so that came south.
Story_ID: 284453
Speaker 1: What year did your parents [Mary Daniel Cook and Emanuel Cook] get married?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: No, I, I don't.  It had to have been in the--it must have been the late teens [1910s], yeah, in the teens [1910s] yeah, but I don't recall the year.
Speaker 1: Were they very young when they got married?
Speaker 2: Well, fairly-- not very young.  My guess is, oh any guess would be, they were in their early twenties.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My dad was in his mid-twenties and so forth, but they, they didn't marry young.  In those days, you just didn't marry young like you do now (unclear).
Speaker 1: Well, I've heard that people could get-you know where women would get married, you know, at fifteen, sixteen years old in those days.  You know in some places in the South and in the North.
Speaker 2: I guess so, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know usually educated people don't get married as soon as others you know so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but you know in my generation, growing up in Griffin [Georgia], you--folks didn't get married that young.  You have teens for the most part get married, it just didn't happen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it just didn't.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have any brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, well there were six of us to begin with.  Now all, now there are only two of us, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was next to the youngest, but the youngest one died in '98 [1998] I guess it was-my youngest brother yeah you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But there were six of us, four boys and two girls.
Story_ID: 284454
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory, the first memory that you can put your finger on?
Speaker 2: Oh, well the earliest I, I--no, I would say the earliest memory--I remember my--had vivid memories of my dad [Emanuel Cook] cutting you know--he would always-he had four churches and he would go out of town on Saturday or Friday and come back on Monday morning and on the southern train some time his members would bring him back to Griffin [Georgia] in the car, but mostly it was on the southern train about ten o'clock in the morning, and my, my siblings and I would listen to hear that train, that whistle coming to Griffin was brining my dad home and so forth.  So that that was a time of great joy and celebration.  Sometimes on Monday mornings now I can hear that train you know coming back to Griffin--it's my dad.  And I, I would have--I'd have to been very, very young to you know to observe that and the symbolism of dad you know coming back in town on the ten o'clock train on Monday morning.
Speaker 1: Now were they.
Speaker 2: So that was a special time.
Speaker 1: Now, were they married--I mean what--did they move to Griffin after they got married or before?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah they moved to Griffin. Moved to Griffin in the '20s [1920s], it, it had to have been early '20s because I was born in '28 [1928] and we still owned the house where I was born in Griffin, but prior to that--and they built this house, but prior to building the house, they had rented a house in Griffin, and so forth where one of my other, well two other siblings were born, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it had to have been in the early '20s [1920s].
Story_ID: 284455
Speaker 1: Okay, can describe where you lived, and what it was like, and, you know, what the street was like, and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah well, we lived 739 South East Street in Griffin, Georgia, and 8th Street was next to Hill Street, not 9th [Street] but Hill Street.  Blacks lived on 8th Street, whites lived on Hill Street and, and so forth, and right on Hill Street, almost parallel to where we lived, was a filling station run by a white family and so forth who had two sons, who were about the ages of my brother, my kid brother and myself and their names were Billy and Ray Sims.  That was Sims, and this is one the, the most vivid and illuminating experiences of my, my childhood.  Ray and Billy were our very good friends, they were white, and my brother, Payton [Cook], and I were of course black and we played together a great deal.  Built a wagon together, a little tricycle together and all that.  And they ate in our homes quite often at our tables, and we ate and now never in their home you know, but you know in the store, candy, this, that and the other and so forth, but we developed a great affection for each other, a great, a great love each other, a great love for each other in fact.  The father was an alcoholic, and the mother was named Kate [Sims], I should never forget, was very nice, she was very decent and so forth.  But we used to play at their home, play in our home and I (unclear) and I should never forget.  I, and I, I suppose I was six or seven in, in that vicinity and we were--I, I was up to Bill and Ray's house, playing in the yard and there was a white kid, a girl, playing with us--had joined us--we were all-everybody was playing as kids would play. And a white fellow who was a friend of the Sims family saw us all playing and he looked at me and became terribly upset and told me, "Sam [HistoryMaker Samuel DuBois Cook], you go home."  I said, I, I think I'll go to my grave with this memory--"Sam, you go home and you stay there when you get there."  And he said it with all the harshness, all the anger, all the insensitivity that you know, and behind it all of course it's racism, and it taught me a great lesson you know in terms of white girls, females, and so forth you know was that sex was a great bugaboo you know for southern whites and so forth.
Story_ID: 284456
Speaker 1: Can you tell us what he said?
Speaker 2: He just said, "Sam [HistoryMaker Samuel DuBois Cook]," he said, and said it harshly "and you go home and you stay there when you get there."  He didn't call me the n-word, he just said, "Sam, you go home," he knew who I was and "you go home and you stay there when you get there" in other words, don't come back up here no more.  And I was hurt, I was crushed because of Billy and Ray and the Sims family, you know had been so nice to me, and we'd been nice to them, we (unclear) love each other.
Speaker 1: Well what did they say, did--?
Speaker 2: See that's the thing, they didn't say anything, and I (unclear) I didn't understand it as a kid.  But I ran across the field from Hill Street to 8th Street [Griffin, Georgia] where we lived, crying, just, just crying because I was hurt and told my dad [Emanuel Cook] what had happened.  He, obviously understood what it was, and my dad, who was not--he was (unclear) wonder who was demonstrative of affection and excessively, but he understood and he took me on his lap and hugged me, and tried to explain you know, your mother [Mary Daniel Cook] came to me and talked to me about you--how do you explain to your, your kid you can't go over here to the swimming pool because you're black; you can't go to the theatre because you're black; you can't go to the restaurant?  How do you explain to your kids?  You can't play over here and so forth, and how he talks about how you stutter and stumble for words trying to explain to your kid.  But this was is what my dad--you know he tried to explain but he says (unclear) he said, "Just don't go back there no more" and you know and so forth, just don't, and I never went back.  But that experience and that harshness will never leave me, I'll go to my grave remembering that and so forth and the lesson, and what it told me intuitively about racism, about white women and white fears of blacks in terms of sexuality.
Story_ID: 284457
Speaker 1: Did your parents [Mary Daniel Cook and Emanuel Cook] give you any instructions about how to behave around white people?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh yes, oh yes that was part of the social etiquette, it's part of the cultural mores and folkways, that you know you just didn't, for the most part you didn't associate, you didn't fool around with them. But with Ray Sims, and his family you know we, it was a natural thing in terms of the friendship and so forth.  But be careful, oh, yes, be careful.  I never you know my dad wouldn't let us work for white folk.  He didn't like white--in Griffin [Georgia], unh-uh, he never.  Wouldn't let my sister work with white folk, wouldn't let us work for white folk in Griffin, and I didn't understand it.  We didn't understand it growing up why he was so stern about this and so forth.  He just said, "Don't."  I had friends who used to caddy at the golf course and the golf course was within walking distance of our house on the South East Street right on that side of the--of 9th Street and my friend, Will Martin, and Cokeman [ph.] and them would go there and make some extra money caddying.  My dad would never let us go, my--wouldn't let us go over to caddy.  "No, you can't do that." I I, you know--"Why can't we go make some money?"  But he was trying to protect us against the brutality and the harshness of racism.
Speaker 1: Now, was Griffin a fairly well-to-do little town?  You tell me they had a golf course and I mean were the whites pretty well off there?
Speaker 2: Well, they were much better off than the blacks, it was not a wealthy town, but you know had Hill--you had that street, Hill Street, was the most--I suppose--the most prestigious street in Griffin.  Whites with antebellum homes and, and so forth.  We used to pick berries and sell berries you know to whites and so forth, but they had a golf course and of course blacks obviously, couldn't play there.  They couldn't play in the golf course in Atlanta [Georgia] in those days and so.  In fact, it was only in the '40s [1940s] when you got to play in Atlanta with [Alfred] "Tup" Holmes and all them well.  But my dad and my mother--my dad in particular--were trying to protect us from the harsh brutality of racism.  This was a method of trying to salvage our sense of self-respect and our dignity.  So we didn't work with white folk, course you didn't work with blacks either for that matter, so we stayed with our own world, but white, you just didn't do that.  He didn't want us in the white folk kitchen working, he didn't want his daughter--he didn't want us to caddy and all that, and so forth.  I was walking around the street as a kid in Griffin, and it's amazing how they saying come back, hadn't thought of this in years, but I should never forget walking down the street and on 8th Street in the white folk's section of 8th Street and a policeman called me and said, "I, I want you cut my grass."  Of course when he called, when the policeman called me, you can imagine the fears of black kids in Griffin, Georgia back when he was only--back in the--it had to have been in the '30s [1930s], but all kind of fears.  I almost wanted to run, I don't know what would have happened run and so forth, but he said, "Would you like to cut my grass" and so forth.  I told him no.  I'm pretty sure I said, "No, sir," in terms of racial etiquette and what I said, and I thanked him for it and so forth very nice, but the fact that he, he here's a policeman calling me, I think got my attention and asked me to work for him and I said, "No."  But it was against the family etiquette, social etiquette and racial etiquette and so forth.
Speaker 1: How did he respond to you saying no to him?
Speaker 2: Well, no, he was nice you know.  He said, "Okay," you know, just like that you know.  He was nice.  He wasn't hostile or anything, so.
Story_ID: 284458
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself growing up?  What kind of kid were you and what did you like and what didn't you like?
Speaker 2: What now?
Speaker 1: What did you like and what didn't you like as a kid growing up in Griffin [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Oh, I liked athletics and played them.  I liked tennis, football, and basketball.  But I also liked academics. You know. I liked to study.  I liked to do well in school.  I liked to be singled out by my teachers when they would brag on me and so forth.  In terms of studying and all that, I remember when I was in high school, I guess the eighth grade, we had a class in the library, vocational high school. I remember, vocational high school. In the south, that wasn't Griffin High School [Griffin, Georgia].  Griffin was for whites.  Vocational [Griffin Vocational High School, Griffin, Georgia] was for blacks. In Athens, Georgia, Athens High School [Clarke Central High School] was for whites.  Blacks went to Athens High and Industrial School [Athens, Georgia] and Meriwether County--blacks when to Meriwether [County] Training School [Meriwether County, Georgia], so vocational and so forth.  But, anyway, in vocational high school, in this, we had a class in the library and you had as many books in that library as you could put in one-fourth quarter in this room in terms of books.
Speaker 1: It wasn't a large library?
Speaker 2: You can say that again. And the books that were in there were handed down from whites but there was a picture on the wall that haunted me. And it was a picture of blacks in congress in 1921 during Reconstruction.  Now, I said to myself, "How did it happen?"  We once had blacks in congress, '21 [1921] as I recall, and you had two black senators short term for Mississippi.  Here, now, in Georgia, blacks could not vote.  We can't even vote.  How did it happen?  We had all this political power during Reconstruction and now we don't have any?  You can't vote at all. So you had the white primary, exclusive white. Republicans had no power.  If you won the Democratic primary, you were elected there, so. No competitive politics.  And I said, "One of these days, I'm going to find out what happened," (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So nobody in school could explain it to you--could explain the situation to you?
Speaker 2: I'm sure I had a good teacher of history and so forth.  But this was just, this was more of my conversation with the photograph.
Speaker 1: Okay, but did you have black history in school?  Did they talk about--did they try to give you a decent--did they try to tell you about the Civil War, slavery, about Reconstruction?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean from a black prospective that where you would know that there were black congressmen?
Speaker 2: No, they didn't say--well, they talked from the book and in those days, of course, the textbooks were obviously racist and drew a picture of Reconstruction, black corruption, black ignorance--you would've never thought you had an intelligent black in congress at all, you know, some in congress were very bright.  And they didn't say anything about the ignorant white congressmen and so forth, but it was the picture that the textbook painted in those days that the black were ignorant, they didn't know what they were doing; up smoking cigars; trying to be big shots and all this kind of stuff.  But I had a good teacher named Penrose Park [ph.], who was a football coach, who taught civics and history.  And you know, he would try to give a more modern interpretation of it.
Story_ID: 284459
Speaker 1: Where did you go to school?
Speaker 2: Where who?
Speaker 1: Where did you go to school?  What was the name of your school, the first school you attended, grade school?
Speaker 2: Well the first school I attended in Griffin [Georgia], was, it had been Cabin Creek [School], independent, it's private school run by the association, Baptist primarily.
Speaker 1: It was called Cabin Creek you said?
Speaker 2: Cabin, pardon me. Cabin Creek School.
Speaker 1: Cabin Creek School, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And the principal was a man named A.Z. Kelsey. K-E-L-S-E-Y
Speaker 1: A.Z. Kelsey?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, who had gone to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was a very stern, very stern man.  His wife also taught in that school.  Mrs. Marie Kelsey.  There was another teacher named Patrick, Lillian Patrick [ph.].  Dr. Kelsey, Reverend--Professor Kelsey, we called him, had a son who went to Morehouse and made a brilliant record.  He went to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and got a Ph.D. from Yale, made a brilliant record at Yale; in fact, the dean at Yale said that they don't come much better than George Kelsey.  Later, he became a big--taught at Morehouse and was at--taught at Morehouse during my time; and went with the Federal Council of Churches and the executive and later taught at Drew University [Madison, New Jersey], called Christian ethics and became one of the preeminent theologians in America.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Drew University is kind of a special theological school.  It's one of the toughest ones I heard.  It's one of the best ones.  It's where [HistoryMaker] James Cheek--I think--went, to Drew, I believe.
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: James Cheek, who was--Dr. James Cheek (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I know him.  He went to--was president of Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Drew University.  So George Kelsey ended up at Drew University?
Speaker 2: He retired there about ten years ago.
Speaker 1: Is he related to--is Dr. Richard Kelsey, who was at [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio], related to George Kelsey?
Speaker 2: Not to my knowledge.  He had one brother named after his father, A.Z.  Dr. Kelsey wrote several books.  He wrote one of the most compelling books on racism, 'Racism and the Christian Understanding of Man,' [George D. Kelsey] which is very influential.  But, anyway, I went to that school under Professor A.Z. Kelsey.  We called him in those days professor.  We called the principal Professor Kelsey.  I went there until I was about oh I guess about third grade and they closed the school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is there a story behind the school being closed?
Speaker 2: Well, no money, no support, insufficient support.
Speaker 1: This is in the days of the early years of depression--the middle of the Depression, the middle of the Great Depression I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In 1935, maybe?
Speaker 2: In '35 [1935] or '36 [1936], yeah, '28 [1928], yeah, and my dad [Emanuel Cook] and others in Griffin tried to raise money.  Cabin Creek Association came to support the school and they did but they just didn't have the money to support it, but it was a very good independent private schools.  There were a lot of those private schools in the South. Several years ago, I spoke at the Providence Church.  At that time, I was president of Dillard [University, New Orleans, Louisiana] and I spoke at Providence Church and one of the fellows got up.  He knew me in Griffin growing up and said, "I always said I wanted to be a professor." In quotes here. And he talked about how his father, my father and several others supported education tried to raise money, and he said they went to Cabin Creek, Cane Creek [School, Lumpkin County, Georgia], and he said Taylor Creek [School, Hinesville, Georgia].
Story_ID: 284417
Speaker 1: And you was talking about all the schools named after creeks: Taylor Creek, Cabin Creek.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's creek (laughter). Yeah, but despite all the efforts, it [Cabin Creek School, Griffin, Georgia] didn't have enough resources so [A.Z.] Kelsey had to close it.  It was an independent school and it was a tragedy because it was a very good private school.  It was very high standards and Professor Kelsey was again was, was particularly a very strict, you didn't smoke, you didn't dance, in fact I remember him slapping a young lady for 'cause he thought she was flirting (laughter).
Speaker 1: She--thought she what?
Speaker 2: She was flirting with some fellow (laughter), she--bam!  So when I.
Speaker 1: That's a different, well this is a different era we're talking about.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah, absolutely!
Speaker 1: He could actually--he actually could just slap the young lady?
Speaker 2: He actually slapped her.
Speaker 1: And, was there--with her parents' consent?  Everything was okay?
Speaker 2: Everything was, sure. Parents were happy-they said because she was flirting and so forth.  He thought, he thought she was flirting or kissing a boy and so forth and he, he--bam!   We use laugh 'cause hand like it looked paralyzed anyway.  See it's full force with (unclear) but he had a very high standards and so forth.  So when that school closed, my dad [Emanuel Cook] sent us to--we had to go to public school, Spring Hill School [Cook County, Georgia] under Mrs. Cora Lee Nimmons.  Now this was important to me, a pivotal point in my life.  With this school, Spring Hill School, not too far from my house to tell the truth.
Speaker 1: Now, how old were you when you went to the Spring Hill School?
Speaker 2: Fourth grade, I guess I was about eight somewhere in there, about eight years old or some--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I had a, a sister who's a couple years older who went there with me.
Story_ID: 284418
Speaker 1: Spring Hill [School, Cook County, Georgia] was a public school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a public school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And had a younger brother who was also, who also went there.  He was about five years younger somewhat several years younger than me, than I am. And I had a good experience the first semester, I guess it was.  But then they had, there was a public school we had to pay to tuition.  And, as I recall, tuition was only about--I guess the bill was only about seven, eight dollars and my, my dad [Emanuel Cook] had a son and a daughter in college at the time.  I had a brother at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia]; I had a sister at Georgia State [College, Savannah, Georgia], which at that time was called--I mean it, it's-now it's called Savannah State College, [sic. Savannah State University] but in those days, it was Georgia State.  Now Georgia State is white you know and they took the name and made it Savannah State College.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Georgia State in those days was a public college for black students I guess?
Speaker 2: That's right, public college, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: So there was a son at Morehouse and a daughter at Georgia State.  My dad simply didn't as poor preacher, simply did not have at that time the seven--I think about [$]7.50 something like that to pay that tuition at that time.  He was going to pay it now but he just didn't have it at that time.  So Mrs. Cora Lee Nimmons, bless her soul, said, "If you don't have it by what the next day, you can't come back to school."  So you know I told my dad.  He said, "Well, I'll get the money but I just don't have it right now," and so forth.  "I'll pay it, tell Mrs. Nimmons."  I told her, she said, "No, you can't, you gotta go home."  So we left the school and one of the saddest days of my life I suppose but, and ironically as, as it turned out it was a blessing in a sense in disguise.  So we went home and told our parents what had happened. And my dad was a proud man.  You're talking about a proud black man, he was a proud man and so forth.  So he said, "Okay, don't worry about it because I'm going to send you to Professor Mosby--George Mosby, M-O-S-B-Y, who ran a county school, but a county school didn't require any tuition.  So we went to the county school, my three brothers, my brother and sister.  I walked, course you didn't have buses in those days for blacks.  We walked to the county school.
Speaker 1: How far was it?
Speaker 2: It was three or five miles down the highway to Professor Mosby.
Story_ID: 284419
Speaker 1: Now, this was a one-room schoolhouse; it was just a one-room schoolhouse. So, he was the one teacher, so we would (laughter) do, he would--the second grade went by, you know.  The first grade leaves, the third grade, you know, so what, what have you and so forth, and I--so we studied under Professor [George] Mosby, but Professor Mosby took great interest in us, and I guess in me in particular, and he asked me once what--asked me once, as a class what Christmas meant and so forth to nineteen--I say forty-seven [1947].  It was 1947 that say what does that mean and I said, you know, "One thousand, (unclear)," so he thought I was smart.  So he encouraged and so forth, and so I said this is a blessing in disguise, 'cause he put his arms around me.  He thought I was smart.  He had a stroke and I would go to his house to take mathematics under him in mathematics class, and he was--oh, he thought I was a--you know he encouraged me.  That meant the world to me, and would tell my dad [Emanuel Cook] and my dad thought so highly of Professor Mosby, you know, "Sam [HistoryMaker Samuel DuBois Cook] is," as he said, "he's going places, you know.  He's a smart kid," this and the other and that just did everything for me.  So it was a transformative experience, plus it was a blessing in disguise that I was rejected from this public school [Spring Hill School, Cook County, Georgia], city school, because we didn't have tuition [$]7.50, whatever it was to pay 'em, and once this school where it that had a principal, a teacher--a one-room schoolhouse, but he--who believed in me and who encouraged me and he was very confident and who made a tremendous difference in my life and my life journey.  So much so that when I got ready to go to high school [Griffin Vocational High School] in Griffin [Georgia], I took the test and was supposed to be in the eighth grade and they put me in the ninth grade you know.  They felt I was too smart to be in the eighth grade and so forth, but thanks to this professor who encouraged me (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How do you spell his name again?
Speaker 1: M-O-S-B-Y. Mosby.
Speaker 2: Okay, M-O-S-B-Y
Speaker 1: George Mosby, M-O-S-B-Y.
Story_ID: 284420
Speaker 1: And what was the name of your high school when you?
Speaker 2: Voca- high school was vocational.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what was the name of it?  It was called--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what was the name?  It was called--?
Speaker 2: What the school I went to there.
Speaker 1: Griffin Vocational School or what was it?
Speaker 2: No, I said high school was just Vocational High School [sic. Griffin Vocational High School, Griffin, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what was the name of it you know, I'm asking for the name of it.
Speaker 2: That's the name.
Speaker 1: Just Vocational High School?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay all right.
Speaker 2: That was the official name.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: That's on my diploma, Vocational High School.
Speaker 1: All right, okay, now that, that's a public school, right?
Speaker 2: Public school, yeah.
Speaker 1: City public school, was it city or county?
Speaker 2: City.
Speaker 1: City.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, now well so you were prepared by Professor [George] Mosby?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And--now, what became of him?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: He died, he had a stroke and never fully recovered, but he, I think he died while I was in college [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay, what was high school like?
Speaker 2: Oh, high school it was--I was there only three years.  So, it was--I had a great experience in high school.  Well, it's--you know get carried away, forget about these things, and, you know, we accept to think it's normal.  The books we had were hand-me-down books.  We never had the new textbooks, all the textbooks and the books we had in that school were hand-me-down from the white high school, Griffin High School [Griffin, Georgia], with the names of the whites in there, with their writing, you know, with the torn pages, all of it, right down to the--I never had new textbook, always.
Speaker 1: Did you ever have messages inside of the books from the white students (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, I don't recall any message at all.
Speaker 1: I've heard that, that they write things in there since they knew the books were going to a black school, they'd write insults in the books at set times.  You never had that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I never had that, I never had that.  I played football.  Never had any new towels, they were hand-me-down towels.  I never had any new shoes to fit my feet, they were hand-me-down shoes and they you know, and I had pretty big feet (laughter) and so forth so I never had shoes so--those hand-me-downs, right down the line and so forth.  There was a nice football field--and we always played the homecoming game at Lightfoot Park [Griffin, Georgia], the white park, the white football field. And we would play schools like Athens High and Industrial School [Athens, Georgia], and so forth--homecoming and so forth and with the homecoming you know blacks came from every place to see this team you know playing and so forth.  But it was--I had good teachers, one I referred to earlier.  There was another one who really, really taught civic and history and so forth, Mrs. McKinney [ph.]--Ms. McKinney had gone to Spelman [Seminary; Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] and who encouraged me and who took a liking to me, and in fact she has a sister who is a minister here.  Now I've forgotten her name and she says that, that the teacher she just loves me.  She talked about I was her best student.  Well, I talked about her too, I had a crush on her.  She was just as sweet as she could be you know and so forth, but she encouraged me and she supported me and so forth.
Story_ID: 284421
Speaker 1: I had another teacher, named Mrs.--Ms. Dorothea Boston [ph.], B-O-S-T-O-N who got a group of us who were interested in going to college and taught us Latin after school.  So I had Latin in [Griffin] Vocational High School in Griffin, Georgia.
Speaker 2: Now, Latin in those days--up until I guess the early '60s [1960s] was taught, in most high schools you had to take Latin if you were going to college, right?
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: I know a lot of places in the--even in the North--
Speaker 1: I ain't never (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) Latin was.
Speaker 1: Latin, yeah.  But she taught Latin, so we stayed after school and in that Latin class, was a fellow named T.P. Griffin, Jr. [ph.] who is now--who almost became a bishop in the United Methodist Church, the pastor of one of the biggest churches in California, and later in New York and so forth and all that.  But he was in that class.  Another one was Richard Bass [ph.], who finished Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and, and so forth, but those who were interested in going to college--and she wasn't paid for it.  She just wanted to help prepare us for it, to go to college.  And when I got to college and I ran across all the Latin phrases in philosophy and metaphysics you know, I, I could appreciate more fully what she was talking about, and Latin had a great impact as you know on the French language and so forth, so that helped, helped me to the background.  So I was a student academically and athlete and, and so forth, developed great friendship there.  We had three males in my class, three of them, and all of us went to college.
Speaker 2: Just three?  Three out of how many?
Speaker 1: Three out of I guess about thirty-yeah about thirty students and so forth.
Speaker 2: That's interesting so females, they had that many females in school?
Speaker 1: Um, yeah.
Speaker 2: What happened to the males do you have a--?
Speaker 1: Uh?
Speaker 2: What happened to the males?
Speaker 1: The males?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: We all went to college.
Speaker 2: No, what happened to the balance in the class, you know, if there was only three of you all out of thirty (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No--there were males.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And all three of us went to college.
Speaker 2: Yes, but what happened to all the rest of the males in the community that didn't go to school?  I mean what were they doing?
Speaker 1: Oh, boy--trying to get job and doing this and that and the other, just fell by the wayside.
Speaker 2: 'Cause it was the [Great] Depression.
Speaker 1: And many of them were very intelligent students, good athletes and a lot of great athletes came out of that high school and came out of Griffin, and.
Speaker 2: Any ones that we would know of?
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: Any ones we would know about now or, or?
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh there's a list that I might share.  Well, one who just retired from Atlanta [Georgia], Atlanta, the Falcon [Atlanta Falcons]--[Jessie] Tuggle.
Speaker 2: Oh, Tuggle the.
Speaker 1: That the linebacker.
Speaker 2: He was a linebacker, right?
Speaker 1: But Richard Dent who played with the Chicago Bears--from Griffin.  There were several others, I use to know their names, their--I've forgotten now, but several of them came from Griffin.  Whites and blacks came, a place that fostered athleticism and so forth.  So high school was--and I mentioned to the three males and I went to Morehouse, T.P. Griffin who almost became a bishop and who is still alive and doing quite well and prominent in the United Methodist Church, and the third was Richard Bass.  T.P. went to Clark College [sic. Clark University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and became the president of the student body.  I went to Morehouse, and I became president of the student body, so we used to collaborate, and Richard Bass went in the [U.S.] Navy and then went to Morehouse two or three years later.
Story_ID: 284422
Speaker 1: So when did you graduate from high school [Griffin Vocational High School, Griffin, Georgia], what year was it?
Speaker 2: That was 1944.
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-four [1944], and so you were sure you were going to college when you graduated?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah it was just never--it was never any question in my mind.  I just knew I was going to, and I knew I was going to grad school somehow, and--
Speaker 1: How did you end up choosing Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia]?  Or how did you, you know end up, you know, 'cause no one in your family had really been--well, your brother had been to Morehouse.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my brother went to Morehouse, my sister went to Georgia State [College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia] and so forth, and so my dad [Emanuel Cook].
Speaker 1: Is that why you ended up there?
Speaker 2: My dad's a very good friend of Dr. [Charles DuBois] Hubert and all that.  But actually the reason I went to Morehouse--in those days Morehouse had a working agreement, a contractual agreement with various tobacco farms in Connecticut, Coleman Brothers Hartman Bros. [sic. Hartman Tobacco Company], and Morehouse would send students there in the summer to work on the tobacco farm, every summer there's a lot of them.
Speaker 1: In Connecticut?
Speaker 2: In Connecticut, not too far from Springfield, Massachusetts, across the border and, and so forth, and it's imported across the--now, Bloomfield, Connecticut, Hazardville, Connecticut, Simsbury, Connecticut, not too far from Hartford [Connecticut], but Morehouse would send students there every summer.  I guess because I had a brother in Morehouse that helped me and so forth.  I started going up there when I was in high school, a sophomore in high school, every summer, going to the tobacco farm in Connecticut and worked through the whole summer, and it was great--it was like you know we, it was like college that, that summer.  We used to play softball and had a glee club, a chorus and so forth and had all kinds of athletic activities and so forth.  So I started going as a sophomore in college going back and forth, and all those Morehouse guys, I got to meet so many of them and so forth.  So it was just natural, and just my brother having gone to Morehouse, but that was where I met Dr. and my great friend and mentor and benefactor, Dr. Benjamin Elijah Mays, whom I think about almost daily.  I met him at the tobacco farm, and he influenced me a great deal.  So I just knew it was, it was an interest.  Morehouse was so much a part of my psychic and my mentality that I applied to one school: Morehouse. And this of course is hard to believe, it never occurred to me until I went back to Morehouse for my thirtieth anniversary--what would have happened had Morehouse turned me down?  What would have I done?  I just--it just never you know.  I, I just knew I was going to Morehouse.  It was written in the stars.  I just knew it.
Story_ID: 284423
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And after having Dr. [Benjamin] Mays, you know, I was going to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Describe meeting Dr. Mays.  How did you meet him and what were the circumstances?
Speaker 2: Now, that I can answer.  On the tobacco farm. And it would have a Morehouse faculty and so forth there as supervisors and they would come up.  Every summer, Dr. [B.R.] Brazeal who at that time was dean, whose daughter [Aurelia E. Brazeal] is now an ambassador to Ethiopia and so forth.  (Unclear) B.R. Brazeal, distinguished economist who got a Ph.D. from Columbia University [New York, New York].  He would always come up in the summer and make a tour of all the tobacco farms that I mentioned and some that I didn't mention to see if everything was all right, and you know he was the kind of diplomat in residence temporarily.  Dr. Mays would also come up to visit, so he came up to--I was at Hartman Brothers [sic. Hartman Tobacco Company] in Hazardville, Connecticut and Dr. Mays came up to visit the--his students and so forth and watch, and Dr. Mays was a great competitor, he jumped out there and was picking tobacco and so forth, but to Dr. Mays--I said and he spoke to us and I remember to this day the kind of suit and he became, not only my mentor, and when I came back to Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] to teach, but a good friend.  I, I came, I was very close to him.  In fact, I guess the biggest honor in my life and the most difficult task I've ever been assigned was he asked me to deliver the eulogy when he died and so forth.  And when he wrote his book, 'Born to Rebel: [An Autobiography,' Benjamin E. Mays] he asked me to write the introduction and so forth.  So he became just my idol, and that's why I said I think about him you know quite often.  And, but I remember the suit Dr. Mays had on when, when I met him and he was going down into tobacco farm with that fine suit and so forth.  But that's how I met Dr. Mays on the tobacco farm, and there's a famous pediatrician here, a Morehouse grad, Dr. Otis W. Smith.  You might have interviewed him along with Dr. Clinton W. Warner [sic. HistoryMaker Clinton Warner]. And one summer, Dr. Smith and I were asked to stay on the tobacco farm two extra weeks--after all the other guys had gone, some two hundred or more had left, and we stayed there and took care of the farm, closed everything down.  We were just glad for the opportunity, stay there and made some extra money and so forth.  Now, he's a wealthy physician, millionaire, and he retired and, and so forth.  But that's the story about Mays and about how I met Dr. Mays and about how I met Dr. Mays (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we became very (unclear) very good friends and when I came to Atlanta University to teach in 1956, he was in Hughes Hall, his office was down that way, mine was over here and Dr. Clements [Dr. Rufus E. Clement] was over there so, and we developed this, you know, and I saw him all the time.
Story_ID: 284424
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He [Dr. Benjamin Mays] performed the ceremony for my wife [Sylvia F. Cook] and myself when we married.
Speaker 1: Did--I heard that Dr. Mays would often come into the cafeteria and stand on the table and deliver oration for the students, you know.  Did you ever witness anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, I never saw him stand on a table.  He would come--would sometimes when he was concerned of some immediate issue, he would come in the dining room sometime and dress us down.  I remember he came in once, he was upset because we were striking.  Guys throwing food around.
Speaker 1: You were striking?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: You were strike--oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yeah this was back in the '40s [1940s] now.  Striking against the dining room, they didn't like the food and so forth.  And Dr. May got up there and dressed them down, people in the world starving and you're around throwing food on the ground.  You know, he, he dressed us down, and another time, we were discourteous to the dietician and he came in and he was right.  He dressed us down, and he was always-I don't remember him getting on the table, standing on the table and I doubt, of course you know apart from these things develop and all these myths develop. And I'm sure I perpetuated some of them and so forth (laughter) you know (unclear).
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite memory of Dr. Mays of something he said or did?
Speaker 2: Oh, I have so many favorite memories of Dr., Dr. Mays.  I suppose one of them is--this is kind of humorous and so, I told Dr. Mays I wanted a picture, a picture of him to put in my office and he said he is going to give it to me and so forth, and I kept asking about it and he never did.  So I said, "Dr. Mays, I, I, you know I need your picture in my office.  I need you to catch me when I stumble and to pick me up if I fall."  I said it just like that.  He looked at me and said, "You better--Samuel [HistoryMaker Samuel DuBois Cook] you better leave that to the Lord."  And I said, "Mr. President, you know, you, you don't realize for many of us, you is the Lord" (laughter), and he said to me, he said, "Boy, I don't know what I'm going to do with you" (laughter).  But we had that kind of relationship, and that's one of my favorite things about Dr. Mays is he just, just really. But I, I guess 'cause I got so many, but I gotta tell you this one since you impress me.  When I went to grad school at [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio], I heard that Dr. Mays was coming up my first quarter that Dr. Mays was coming to speak before the Ohio Federation of Churches on Broad Street at the city--at the auditorium [Veterans Memorial Auditorium, Columbus, Ohio].  So I said, "I better go, I want to hear Dr. Mays."  So I, knowing Dr. Mays, I know he's gonna grill me about my grades.  I mean he was serious.  I had just finished my first quarter, had my grades, and I had made all A's.  I had taken six courses, and I made six A's.
Story_ID: 284425
Speaker 1: Now, you were talking about the story, now you had all A's.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I well I had all A's and I said I'm going to see Dr. [Benjamin] Mays.  I said knowing Dr. Mays, he could be, he's very specific with detail oriented as well as cosmically oriented, so I said I'd better put these grades, because he's gonna ask me about my grades, he might ask me for proof, not what I say but proof.  So I put the grades in my pocket.  Dr. Mays spoke before this Ohio Federation [of Churches] and the guy who introduced him said he was a modern St. Paul and this that and the other and so forth.
Speaker 1: Now this was at [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ohio State, (unclear).
Speaker 1: And he spoke for the Ohio--what was it?
Speaker 2: Ohio Federation of Churches.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Ohio conference of Churches (unclear), all over the state and so forth at the city auditorium [Veterans Memorial Auditorium] on Broad Street in Columbus [Ohio].  So he delivered his address, and, of course, when he sat down, people jumped and lapped [sic. clapped] a standing ovation and all of that.  So I went to in the back and to see him you know at the proper time to speak to him.  He was glad to see me of course and he said to me he said, "Mr. Cook [HistoryMaker Samuel DuBois Cook], how are you doing in graduate school at Ohio State?"  So I said "Pretty good."  "Pretty good?" Looking me dead--he could look at you and look through you with his eyes.  "What were your grades?"  Looked straight at me--, "What were your grades?"  I reached in my pocket, pulled out my grades and gave them to him.  He looked--gave me a strange look as though I was an air of disappointment and he said, "This is pretty good."  I said to myself, hell that's damn good news.  But when he looked at me with air of disappointment, he looked as though he would've said "Look you're a Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] man.  You should have made at least ten A's out of six courses," (laughter) you know.  That was his character to me, he just you know, there was air--and there was a part of his philosophy, he, he said, "You're not deserving of unconditional congratulations unless you've done your best."  And he was saying you could do better you know, that what--literally you know, it doesn't mean I (unclear) you know, but he was saying there was always--he's, he's a man, he's, his philosophy will never be satisfied.  Never become complacent no matter what your achievements are, don't become complacent, it's deadening to become complacent, so always be creative and restless about life or any task you undertake.  Now that's a tough philosophy doctor, but that's what he taught us at Morehouse.
Story_ID: 284426
Speaker 1: Well tell us about becoming the student body president at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  Now before we get away--I know we were at [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] but what year were you student body president?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I was student body president at '46 [1946] and '7 [1947].  I was the--until a couple years ago, the only sophomore ever elected president of the student body at Morehouse, and I was elected, elected president in, in large part because the veterans came back and I got several of them to work with me to be my campaign managers and this, that the other and so forth and the guy because he knew he would be the president, blew it I suppose, and politics was in the atmosphere at Morehouse, you know, you ran for office and had the great supporters and (unclear) and so forth.  One of the reasons I was just chosen was because I was the coach of the freshman team, which won the intramural championship in football at Morehouse.  So all the freshmen voted for me.  Thanks to some friends I had and the veterans voted for me.  Some of the veterans came back said, "We're gonna take over, we got these kids here they don't know what they're doing" and so forth.  But I was selected president as a sophomore, and I said that was a great experience, and then some of the folk wanted to impeach me (laughter) in my year.  That's a fascinating one.  You remember veteran Bob Johnson [Robert E. Johnson], you know.  Did you know Bob Johnson?  Bob got a great story about, about that said I'm the only person who didn't know that they had planned to--but, but that small group said planned to impeach me as the president and so forth, and I think I'm the only one who didn't--everyone else, just everyone assumed I knew.  But Bob Johnson tells, so, and I should have had him record it.  You know he could tell it and [HistoryMaker] Lerone [Bennett] can tell it too, the different stories.  But Bob Johnson said that--I said, "Okay, okay do what you want to do but let me speak, just let me say a word, let me say a word."  He put it in terms of Mark Antony speaking and so forth and he said, "Well, let him speak, he-we're gonna kick him out anyway, so let him speak," he said, and I said that's where they made their mistake, they let me speak and I said, "There is some evil is going on in this place," (laughter) and Dr. [Benjamin] Mays and so forth (laughter) and he said that when I finished speaking, said guys started sneaking out on their knees (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you were a pretty good orator.
Speaker 2: Well that, they said.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: They say that, Lerone had said, even written about that, Lerone says I told them, "Look, I can't go back to Griffin, Georgia." That, that's his version, "I can't go back to Griffin, Georgia and tell people an African proverb that I've failed.  They expected me to succeed," (laughter) you know and so forth, said--so I embarrassed them that way and so forth, but he's written about it and so forth yeah in a book or whatnot, but those were great, great and exciting times at Morehouse.
Story_ID: 284427
Speaker 1: So [HistoryMaker] Lerone Bennett was there with you?  Now what was Lerone Bennett like as a student [at Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Very serious student and a football player too.
Speaker 1: Okay, I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, he was a football player.  He didn't play the whole four years, he played his freshman year and was a half back and I loved to kid him.  I said, "I saved you, Lerone, I hit you so hard in the practice field that you said you'd better stick to the books and forget about, you know, football," and said--though he played, played football.  But he was a very good student and one of the most decent individuals I've ever encountered just really. But Bob Johnson [Robert E. Johnson] was great and, but as a student Bob and Lerone worked for the Atlanta Daily World too in various capacities and so forth.  But you had you know across the board, students of various states and had just a great cadre of wonderful students.
Story_ID: 284428
Speaker 1: Now, young [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King, Jr. was a student there when you were at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now what did you think of him at the time?
Speaker 2: Well--I'm--you know when people asked me when did I first met him, and I met him someplace when we were--I guess we were perhaps in middle school.  His daddy [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] used to come to Griffin [Georgia] to speak all the time.  His dad was a big preacher and my dad [Emanuel Cook] was a preacher too and then we got to know each other.  So we pastors met at some convention and, and all that.  So when I came to Morehouse, I had known Martin Luther King, Jr. for some time we were--as classmates and he, he was of course a--always the, the nice, genuine individual, sharp as a tack--he didn't live on campus, he lived at home, so he didn't participate very much in campus activities and people asked me--in fact, someone asked me this, "Did you people--did you know that he was going to become a great leader the way he did?"  [HistoryMaker] Lerone Bennett, so of course, we were smart people, we knew he was going to be great, you know Lerone did.  But one thing we knew, it--knew, there was no--he didn't participate in campus organizations for the most part except I think the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] or something like that but he was not a campus leader at all, But I--we knew that he was going to be a great orator, a great speaker.  And I knew that because at Morehouse in those days, the last two or three, three weeks of--we had chapel six days a week, we would--didn't have chapel on Saturdays, but otherwise we had chapel nine o'clock including Sunday morning and so forth, but in the--at the end of the year people, students from, very outstanding students from various departments would speak in chapel.  There were history, political science, philosophy, chemistry, and this that and the other, this went on all right.  The culminating event was the senior sermon which was someone an outstanding student was chosen to deliver.  Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered the senior sermon and I remember it as though it were yesterday.  I said tell 'em about that.  He use to talk about the memory I had.  But in that senior sermon, Martin Luther King, Jr. said that there are laws in the physical universe which you cannot violate with impunity any more you can violate--he said there are moral laws in the universe that you cannot violate with impunity any more than you can violate the physical laws of the universe.  And he went on to elaborate that and to talk about the continuity of what he later called the continuity of means and ends and the brother soared, I mean, he was just, he just took off.  So we knew he was going to be a great preacher, a great, great speaker, a great orator and so forth, and won the oratorical and he was a, just a delightful--he had a great capacity for friendship, which remained until he died you know, just, just a--every time I'd see him, "Sam [HistoryMaker Samuel DuBois Cook], when are we gonna get together in fellowship?"  He, he you know he used to love to get together and chat and shoot the breeze and this that and the other, very down to earth, just a lot--that's, and--I won't want to say any more about this because it--he was so special.  M.L.--we called him M.L. at Morehouse--was just a nice and decent individual and friendly.  After he won the Nobel Peace Prize, as it was and other student awards.  Now that's saying a lot you know.  I said do you--as a political scientist about the, you know the corruptibility of power, sooner or later I said power's gonna get to him.  It never did.  The last time I saw M.L., and I said it'd be the last thing, was at the Washington Hilton Hotel [Washington, D.C.], he was up there for the Poor People's March [Poor People's Campaign] and so forth.  Saw him in that lobby, and he put his arm around me and he said, "My political advisor." And I said, "You don't listen to me, you know, you, you, you're opposing the war in Vietnam [Vietnam War]."  He was right, I was supporting it.  I was wrong.  I see, I said, "You don't listen to me."  I'm so glad he didn't listen to me and so forth because I misunderstood the war in Vietnam.  A lot of, many people understand the war on Iraq [Iraq War] now have misunderstood, but it's a different situation there obviously, but he said, "We got to get together in fellowship," and, that, that (unclear), but just a, just a nice, just a, just a heck of a nice guy.
Story_ID: 284429
Speaker 1: Tell me about the political science department at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  I mean, who were, did you have any special instructors or mentors in terms of political science there at Morehouse?
Speaker 2: You know, in those days, Morehouse did not have a political science department.  Dr. Arthur Chester Banks [Jr.] came there my sophomore year and got a Ph.D. from John[s] Hopkins University [Baltimore, Maryland] and taught political science one year.  He left and went to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], so, so we didn't have anyone teaching political science.  I didn't major in political science in Morehouse; I majored in history.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then my--
Speaker 1: Well who were the history instructors there that um?
Speaker 2: There was [Dr.] Melvin Dowd Kennedy [Sr.], Thomas J. Curry, C-U-R-R-Y, were the two main people who taught history.  They had a small history department and so forth.  It was not even history and political science, it was just a history department and so forth, but my, my junior year we were told that, in fact Dr. [Benjamin] Mays announced that a young scholar from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] named Robert H. Brisbane was coming down to teach.  It would be our senior year, so we were all excited about Dr. Brisbane coming down from Harvard, but then he announced that Dr. Brisbane decided to remain at Harvard to finish his dissertation, so he didn't come until 19--the fall of '48 [1948] and that was the year I had already finished and so forth.  So we really didn't have political science back then.  I took a course in political science in my senior year at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and so forth, so we really didn't even have political science in those days.
Story_ID: 284430
Speaker 1: So how did you decide to go into political science in graduate school; I mean, what motivated you to do that?
Speaker 2: That's (laughter) that was for a couple of reasons, a very good question.  I'd considered going to law school, the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] and so forth.  And then it occurred to me, I had a younger brother come up.  My father [Emanuel Cook] I had died the summer of the year that I became a rising senior [at Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] in '47 [1947] and I had a younger brother coming on behind me where he had finished high school and I figured that I had to help my kid brother in college, through college, so I decided, I said well I'm going to [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio]--I worked in Ohio State, I worked in the steel mills after I quit working tobacco farms in the summer, so I worked at the steel mills and in Youngstown, Ohio.  So I said, I'm gonna, well what I'm going to do is, I'm going to Ohio State, I met a lot of students from Ohio State, and I'm going to grad school and get a master's [degree], get a job teaching, help my kid brother through college and then I'll go to law school.  Well I went to Ohio State in political science in '48 [1948], the fall of '48 [1948] and a whole new world was open to me.  I, I found it so exciting the ideas and I had three or four professors who took an interest in me. One was named David Spitz, I should never forget, S-P-I, David S-P-I-T-Z, and another was named Louis Nemzer, N-E-M-Z-E-R, and they encouraged me and you know I made nothing but A's in that class, and they talked about my promise as a political scientist, my promise as a scholar and so forth, and I just, just fell in love with political science at Ohio State.  So I decided and I got, they gave me a university scholarship--the highest honor in those days you could get a--as a graduate student.  So it was certain then I was going to get a Ph.D.  So I stayed right there and got a Ph.D. and so forth, took as many hours as I wanted to in philosophy, so I'll get a Ph.D. in philosophy as well as political science, and my advisor said, "You don't need to--you can take as many courses in philosophy as you want to and so forth."  So I stayed and I got my Ph.D. and so forth and then went into the [U.S.] Army for a couple of years.
Story_ID: 284431
Speaker 1: So when did you get your Ph.D. [from The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio], in what year did you?
Speaker 2: In 1954.
Speaker 1: Okay, now that was an important year--that was the year the [U.S.] Supreme Court Brown vs. Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right, that's right absolutely.
Speaker 1: What did you think of it then as a political science student, you know?  What did you think of that decision?
Speaker 2: Well, well it's a revolutionary--by the way, I just wrote an article.  It was published in, in a journal on that case Brown vs. Board of Education.  I was in the [U.S.] Army, sat with Army I got my Ph.D. in '54 [1954], but I got it when I was in the Army.  I was inducted into the Army in October of 1953, and I finished my dissertation while in the Army, so my Ph.D. was awarded while I was a soldier in the Army and, and, and so forth, and I-yes, what's the question I was--?
Speaker 1: I was asking you about Brown vs. Board, and.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I was at, yeah Brown--so I was in the Army at that time when the decision was handed down in May 17th and the excitement I felt and so forth and I said to my sergeant, I said you know--he's from Memphis, Tennessee and I said, "I can see you now down in Memphis, Tennessee enforcing integration orders."  He didn't think it was too funny (laughter) and so but it was a great deal of celebration.  And when the Supreme Court revisited that in 1955, I was writing my, writing a--working on a book at the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.], and I was there for the press conference for Thurgood Marshall and Jim Nabrit [James Nabrit, Jr.] and so forth at the Supreme Court thing in 1955.  So I was right there on the scene.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was actually in the Army when it was handed down, yeah.
Story_ID: 284432
Speaker 1: What was your dissertation about at [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: It was called "An Inquiry into the Ethical Foundations of Democracy."  I was concerned with how you justify and validate democracy from an ethical point of view.  So I dealt with--it was much too broad but it caused me to read widely and had to prepare me professionally.  I can still quote those philosophers but I, you know I dealt with theologians like Reinhold Niebuhr, Henry Nelson Wieman, Paul Tillich, Walter Rauschenbusch.  I dealt with philosophers like John Dewey and Sidney Hook.  I just roamed the field and so forth, and my professor, major professor of writing Dr. [David] Spitz encouraged me to do what I wanted to with it so, so I just read and I wrote, was on the ethical foundation, how do you justify democracy if you, how you justify democracy as against all alternative systems of government and so forth, and so I, I had a lot of fun with that, it was--that-I just--it was just exciting, I found it very exciting.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sociologists like Robert McKeever [ph.].
Story_ID: 284433
Speaker 1: So you completed your [U.S.] Army tour and you received your Ph.D. while you were in the Army in 1954?
Speaker 2: That's right, Ph.D. in 1954.
Speaker 1: In '54 [1954], so what did you do after that?  What did you do in--when you were done with the Army and you had finished your Ph.D.?  It seemed like you're really ready to--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I wrote, wrote around to get a job, wrote to various schools sets of black schools.  I wrote all to black schools matter-of-fact.  You had no chance with white schools, and I got fourteen offers and I reduced them to two: Southern University [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College] in Baton Rouge [Louisiana] and Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University] in Nashville [Tennessee] and so forth. And so I went to Southern, but that summer, school--Marshall University in [Huntington] West Virginia wrote [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] about getting a political scientist and they were sold on me and called my uncle in Youngstown [Ohio] and so forth, but discovered that I was black--that I'm a black rather and that was the end of it.  They were--they didn't offer me the job.  It's, it's, well you know that's you know, so I had--of course in those days you didn't expect white schools to offer you any position.  Only a couple had you know had offered blacks jobs.  Roosevelt at University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] had done, you know, had (unclear)--the University of Chicago had, otherwise, not a single school.  Ohio State--during--at Ohio State during my time there, one of our major professors went to Oxford [University of Oxford, Oxford, England] as a visiting professor, so they had to get a, a replacement.  My major advisor, David Spitz had been a good friend of a schoolmate, a John A. Davis, Allison Davis' brother, the great anthropologist, University of Chicago and so David Spitz invited and told, recommended my department to invite John A. Davis, a black guy, he came for one year, 1951, and wanted to stay but Ohio State would not invite him to stay.  This was 1951 and 1952, and we laughed but blacks at Ohio State laughed because John Davis was as fair skin as any white on the faculty and so forth, but Phi Beta Kappa, Amherst College [Amherst, Massachusetts] and so forth.
Speaker 1: I know Allison Davis has blue eyes, does he have them too or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, those were Alli- so didn't have one time--in my whole time, Ohio State had never had a black on the faculty, but then John A. Davis taught, and he Johnny Davis did the major research for Brown vs. Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954]. [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin and the others worked and, and Kenneth B. Clark worked under John A. Davis, a brilliant political scientist, a bright young researcher and so forth, who did all that social research for the Brown background. And then Ohio State, what five or years, five years had more than one hundred blacks on the faculty, you know one of my own former students is a full professor there, a distinguished professor and, and so forth.  But not one--one black advisor; one visiting professor, and he was not invited to stay, and it crushed him too.
Story_ID: 284434
Speaker 1: Now, where were your--what offer did you take when you started your teaching career, what was your first spot?
Speaker 2: Southern University [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College] in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I went there in large part because a dear friend of mine in graduate school [at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] named Dr. Michael Roddy [ph.] was at Southern.  But Southern, though a public university, had some--so many of the traditions of the private black colleges [HBCUs].  We had convocation, we had even-they had vesper on Sunday.  Dr. [Benjamin] Mays spoke and [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] spoke on vesper and so forth, and a few years early had even had prayer meetings and so forth, so it had a strong tradition of private, yeah in higher education, which was very consistent with my own commitment and background. And I loved it that every--Southern it (unclear) that if--Southern had, had so many distinguished professors that had it able to retain them all, would had a better faculty than Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], it's, it's everybody who is--every black who is somebody in higher education had taught at Southern it seemed, had started their career at Southern back in the '40s [1940s] or '50s [1950s] or '60s [1960s].  Frank Yerby, for example, taught at Southern.
Speaker 1: Frank Yerby, the author?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the author.
Speaker 1: Yeah he's someone that--I don't know that we had very many people mention Frank Yerby but he was a prolific writer, right?
Speaker 2: Prolif- absolutely--sorry, absolutely prolific, but every you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) His name is Y-E-R-B-Y, right?
Speaker 2: That's right, Y-E-R-B-Y, Frank yeah, went to Paine College [Augusta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: In Wilberforce [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: No, in Augusta, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Oh, Paine College in Augusta, ok (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You're talking about Payne Theological Seminary [Wilberforce, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay I got them wrong and got them mixed up.  Okay.
Speaker 2: In Wilberforce, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Paine College in Augusta, Georgia.  And many people of course, didn't know that Frank Yerby was black.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: In fact, it was a long time before I learned that Frank Yerby was black.
Speaker 1: And the reason is that he's the author of so many popular (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So many (unclear).
Speaker 1: Romance and adventure novels, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: That are on the--in every store.
Speaker 2: And lived abroad you know all that time and so forth.
Speaker 1: All the pocket books, the Dell [Publishing] books.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: In the bus stations, all these Frank Yerby--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Novels about pirates and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right, absolutely.
Speaker 1: And people all thought he was white.
Speaker 2: That's right, they thought he was white.
Story_ID: 284435
Speaker 1: But in--there were so many people in Atlanta [Georgia] who taught at Southern [University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] that we organized a group and I was once at Southern club, because there's so many distinguished people and so forth.  So and it was a great academic tradition, a great football tradition, basketball tradition as opposed to football I felt, but it was a great place.  And I enjoyed, I enjoyed it very much.  And, at that time, we had more Ph.Ds. in political science that any other black college in the country, more than Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  We had four Ph.Ds. and, and that was in the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: Four Ph.Ds. in political science? Okay.
Speaker 1: In political science in the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: Who were--can you remember some of the others?
Speaker 1: Aw yeah, Twiley [W.] Barker, Ph.D. University of Illinois [at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] , his brother, Lucius Barker, Ph.D. [University of] Illinois [Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], who were, was president of the American Political Science Association and was chair of the department of political science at Stanford [University, Stanford, California].  Another was Rodney Higgins, (unclear) who had a Ph.D. from the University of Howard [sic. Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and myself.
Speaker 2: Now that's quite a department.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Now, do you remember--I think he might have been there when you were there, but do you remember [HistoryMaker] Thomas N. Todd?
Speaker 1: (Laughter), TNT, he's a younger generation, a big lawyer in Chicago [Illinois].  Oh, TNT, oh, yes, yes, he's, he's a great one.
Speaker 2: Well was he a law student at that time when you were there or was he an undergraduate student or?
Speaker 1: I'd say now I, I think that was little young, little--he was just too young, I--he's of another generation from I.  This was, I was in 1955 and '56 [1956].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I don't think TNT was there at the time.
Speaker 2: He should have been just starting or I think he was just starting around that time.
Speaker 1: Oh probably just, just (unclear) he was just, yeah, yeah.  I remember [HistoryMaker] James Joseph who was an ambassador--was at Southern at the time was there and so forth you know, but I don't think TNT, who is a tremendous guy, a tremendous lawyer and in fact I had him deliver a major address at a conference--over a school conference at Dillard [University, New Orleans, Louisiana] while I was there.  That TNT is something.  Where do you know him from, well?
Speaker 2: Well, from Chicago.
Speaker 1: Oh, Chicago.
Speaker 2: Yeah we know him, he's quite a figure in Chicago.  He's a powerful speaker and a great, great man. Great--
Speaker 1: He is a powerful speaker, and he's given them, the racists at Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana] and so forth a hard time and he's just--you know in terms of integration and so forth and quality education.  Yeah, I, I remember him yeah.
Story_ID: 284436
Speaker 1: Yeah, now as a, now you're a political scientist, a science instructor, are you--now, when you were, were you active in politics at all as a political scientist?
Speaker 2: Oh well at, and not in terms of elected office, but I was very active in Atlanta [Georgia] in the, when I came to Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] in '56 [1956] after Dr. [William H.] Boyd died.  I was very active in the voter's registration, I was very active in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] on the executive committee and I was the youth director of the NAACP in Georgia.  I was active in the Atlanta Negro Voter's League.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: I was active in an interracial group that we met on Saturdays, Don Hollowell [Donald Hollowell], Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] and so forth we--and with our white counterparts we used to meet on Saturday afternoons to talk about the political climate and so forth, and we encouraged Horace Ward to run for [Georgia] State Senate.
Story_ID: 284437
Speaker 1: So I was very active on that level, not as elective, you know, but--
Speaker 2: I know the, the students at Atlanta U [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], they were forbidden to demonstrate I think in the late '50s [1950s] if I'm not mistaken they had, I guess that after in '58 [1958] and '59 [1959], so what were they--the campus took a dim view of them participating in demonstrations?
Speaker 1: Well, it was--I wouldn't say they were forbidden.  It wasn't seriously--Dr. [Rufus E.] Clement at Atlanta University was a pretty conservative man, though he was the first black to be elected to the Atlanta Board of Education and I think Ruehoo [ph.] [Rufus E. Clement] was elected if I'm not mistaken in '54 [sic. 1937] and got a lot of white support because he was on the conservative side, and Atlanta University Center [Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia] at that time that the person who was sensitive on the race issue and I spoke with was Dr. [Benjamin] Mays--he's, he's our spokesman.  The others were more conservative, Dr. Barulich [ph.], Clark [ph.] and so forth.  Dr. [Frank] Cunningham at Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia] was a good man, a philosopher, more reserved and so forth, but Dr. Mays was the voice of social justice in the Center and so forth.  And now of course in the, in '60 [1960], '61 [1961] the students became very active in Atlanta [Georgia] Committee on, Committee on [the] Appeal for Human Rights, [HistoryMaker] Marian Wright Edelman, Medgar [Evers], Lonnie [C.] King [Jr.] were active. I was a kind of the advisor to, to the group, worked with them.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah and Marian Wright Edelman she went on to become head of the Children's--what is it called, the Children's Defense Fund?
Speaker 1: The Children's Defense Fund, yeah.
Speaker 2: Defense Fund, right.
Speaker 1: She's one of the proudest students that I have ever had.  She took all of my courses and she is, she's just absolutely fantastic--brilliant student and so forth, absolutely brilliant.  She wrote a paper for me in a course on contemporary political philosophy on [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King, Jr. and it was a beautiful paper.  And she ended up saying, "You know this must've,"--talking about Dr. King--, "this must've been what Christ was like."  And I gave her an A, an A plus and this that and the other, but I said now, I said, "A term paper is not worship now.  It involves scholarship you know, so don't get carried away too much now in this worship."  Later, I guess twenty years later, I was thinking about Martin Luther King, Jr.--I was writing something and I got deeply involved in it and I said, "This must have been what Jesus would write."  And she influ- I told her later, I said, "You influenced me."  You know the back of my mind that phrase she had--you know stuck with me and so, and she had the insight to see the ultimate ethical, Puritan integrity of Dr. King that, that I didn't see at the time, didn't feel in my guts at the time, but she saw it.
Story_ID: 284438
Speaker 1: How did--now it, from '57 [1957], I think '56 [1956] is Montgomery Bus Boycott and [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] becomes prominent then.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And you, you came to Atlanta U [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] in '56 [1956], right.
Speaker 2: Yeah in '56 [1956].
Speaker 1: That same year, so how did it feel you know knowing someone personally who was becoming the spokesperson for black America in those days?  You know I mean he was becoming the spokesperson slowly but surely and eventually becoming the one that all the media would go to as soon as he had something to say.
Speaker 2: Well I felt great about it.  I, when I first went to Southern [University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] '55 [1955] I was still in the [U.S.] Army in Fort Eustis [Joint Base Langley-Eustis] in Virginia and Dr. King came to speak at vesper and I was going, I'd gone back to back to Fort Eustis Virginia to get my discharge so I missed him, but I wrote him a letter, telling how sorry I was I missed him, but telling him about the striking parallels in our careers, and I gave him my strongly enthusiastic support, and I said that, I quoted Aristotelian 'Dictum'  that the cause for which we love is dearer to us than the object of our love.  And I said you know we have the same, you know we, there's striking parallel.  I mentioned his dissertation on Paul Tillich at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts]; I had a section Paul Tillich and Ron (unclear) on my dissertation and went right down the line and this letter and it's published in his, I think volume six of the, 'The Papers of Martin King Jr' ['The Papers of Martin Luther King, Jr.: Volumve VI, Advocate of the Social Gospel,' ed. Clayborne Carson] and so forth and it's in the, Duke has a, a--I, I committed my papers to Duke University [Durham, North Carolina] and the first thing I submitted to them was the letter that I wrote Martin Luther King, Jr. way back in, in '50 [1950], it must've have been '55 [1955] you know and so forth, you know, you know, but the, the parallels.  [TW1]I always teaching the course in political philosophy you know and he was doing all this and so forth and it's, it's amazing how an individual who was in the most abstract part of philosophy and theology became such a social activist and so forth.  That fascinated me, but I was, I was very, very proud of him and--then, as that letter indicated and so forth; I was just, you know, very proud of him.
Story_ID: 284439
Speaker 1: 'Kay now in those, in those days, in the early part of the Civil Rights Movement, did you, what were your thoughts about what we ought to do as a people?  Did you have any, as a political science professor and what were your thoughts about what our struggles should have been in those days?  And did they change any, you know, or did they stay pretty much the same?
Speaker 2: They stayed pretty much the same.  Um, none of us at that time had been exposed to direct action, the kind of protest they had in Montgomery [Alabama] and so forth.  A little had been tried in all or nothing in Baton Rouge [Louisiana], a bus boycott, you know it failed but, so most of us had relied on the courts, NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] strategy and so forth, and especially attacking segregation head on as they did here. You know at first we saw the equality within the framework of segregation.  Then the NAACP in the early '50s [1950s] started to meet the issue head on and attacked segre- the whole principle and so forth, and of course, I was very much in favor of that.  But in terms of direct action and in terms of student protest, and all that, that was just--none of us had anticipated that.  I had a program, for example, at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] called, town meeting.  And we had all the schools participate.  We had advisors from all the schools.  We had speakers like Dr. [Benjamin] Mays, Dr. [Rufus E.] Clement, Dr. William Holmes Borders and so forth speaking at the town meetings.  We had one town meeting on how can students make the world better.  Not a single one mentioned direct action, to sit-in 'cause not one in the audience, no one on the panel, which was really amazing.  So the sit-in was really, almost a spontaneous thing which no one, I don't quite--anyone anticipated that, you know what happened in February 1, 1960 you know when the students at A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] decided they were gonna sit in.  Is the--you're talking about spontaneity, that was social spontaneity and genius and so forth.  So you know I was a strong and when in Atlanta [Georgia], in, in the, in, '61 [1961] when they got out the Committee on Appeal for, the Committee on [the] Appeal for Human Rights got out this, this fantastic statement.  It was very high level, Dr. Mays worked with them on it.  I did.  Dr. Clement finally approved it and, and so forth, and it was a very great document but it was just new to us, just new to us.  We just had, had no experience whatever was direct action and so forth.  It's, it's like, you know in terms of [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King, Jr.'s strategy, passive resistance.  The [Mahatma] Gandhi technique, it was just new.  Now Reinhold Niebuhr had anticipated, it's in his book 'Moral Man and Immoral Society[: A Study in Ethics and Politics,' Reinhold Niebuhr].  It was published in 1934 [sic. 1932].
Speaker 1: How do you spell Niebuhr?
Speaker 2: N-I-E-B-U-H-R, Reinhold, R-E-I-N-H-O-L-D, Niebuhr, N-I-E-B-U-H-R.
Speaker 1: Oh you're talking about Reinhold Niebuhr, yeah right, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but he talked about the possibilities, the application of civil disobedience and nonviolence.   The Gandhi technique to the American scene to secure equalities for the blacks and it was a brilliant, brilliant idea.  It was M.L. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] who had the wisdom to try and it was spontaneous in Montgomery [Alabama] (laughter).  You know it was, it was almost an act of the divine that he was chosen a leader.  He didn't anticipate being the leader; he didn't want to be the leader as a matter of fact.  He was now, but he said he hadn't been there long enough not to have, develop any enemies and so forth and so it just happened.  But it, there was almost spontaneous.  It was spontaneous, yeah.  The, the fact that Rosa Parks, had been getting up and moving all her life, and decided all of a sudden that she wasn't get up.
Story_ID: 284440
Speaker 1: Now this raises an interesting point here.  There's a popular culture notion that is that all this occurred with a lot of spontaneity, but we all know now that a lot of it was planned.  I mean they had a plan--I mean they didn't plan for [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] to be the leader necessarily, but the action, itself, the strike, the bus strike was something that I believe E.D. Nixon and Rosa Parks actually had planned for some time to do and they were just waiting for the right moment to strike with it.  Isn't this true, I mean?
Speaker 2: Well I think--I don't think it with her, her act of defiance was completely unplanned.  You know, M.L. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] said that she was torn between the forces of history and forces of destiny, which doesn't explain very much, it explains everything at that moment and she said she had not anticipated her not getting up at that time.  Yeah, she'd been getting up all her life and then all of sudden, she said, "I'm not getting up anymore," purely spon--.  Now she'd, they'd been active when you said well Nixon and all them, there were NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and so forth.
Speaker 1: She went to the community organizers, school and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Preparing and so forth.
Speaker 1: Tennessee and yeah.
Speaker 2: Preparing and so forth, but not the boycott--not the, her act of defiance.  Her, her mark of courage on the, on the spur of the moment.  You know, she just said that, you know, "I'm not going to do it anymore."  And the world is different because of it.
Story_ID: 284441
Speaker 1: Now, did those activities make teaching political science in the black colleges [HBCUs] more exciting?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, absolutely, absolutely.  As I, that was really a, an exciting time.  Actually, I will never forget I was teaching summer school in 1964 and the Civil Rights Act [of 1964] had just been passed, Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] had just signed it and this--went to my course in American government, and I was so excited and I told my students, "You know this country is on its way now to justice and full equality.  Take pride in your country now."  And I said, "We're on our way."  I felt, and I'm no great optimist, I'm gonna sit around our neighborhood and name the deficiencies in human nature and so forth, more realistic about human selfishness.  But I was, I was, I was caught up in it and I said, "You can be proud of your country now.  We're on our way."  That was an exciting moment, I mean you now to have been subjected to the brutality of segregation and discrimination and all the institutions of culture had taught us that as blacks, we were something less than human.  We were dehumanized, everything you know from the cradle to the grave, literally.  That taught us we were radically defective as human beings, that we were inferior to whites.  And then all of sudden you know, you see this legislation in [U.S.] Congress.  It's, it's a great moment.
Story_ID: 284442
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a sense--now I've heard Dr. Benjamin Hooks [HistoryMaker Reverend Benjamin Hooks] is very adamant about the fact that NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] court cases and suits and that, those kind of activities were more important than demonstrations and boycotts and so forth.  And there are others that would say just the opposite.  Do you have any analysis of that yourself that you know and what is it?
Speaker 2: In my view is they're both, both are important.  The legal attack was necessary, you had to have the legal framework.  You had to change that and so forth.  There's no question about that.  But by the same token, it was direct action and there were protests, this that and the other which created the legal situation, where you could strike down segregation in Montgomery [Alabama] and so forth.  See both of them are, are crucial.  So I'm all for direct action and all the social pressures that way, but also you need the law on your side.  You gotta change the laws, and that's why, and Dr. [Benjamin] Mays wrote a brilliant, delivered a brilliant address about the contribution of Howard University's School of Law [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], through desegregation and so forth.  Dr. Mays stated that Jim Nabrit [James Nabrit, Jr.] had developed the first course in civil rights in this whole country and so forth, but more deeply, Dr. Mays said, they developed the, the strategy, said the strategy to tear down segregation and discrimination.  The legal strategy could not be developed and was not developed in, in at Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] or Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut] and I would say or Duke law school [Duke University School of Law, Durham, North Carolina], that I love.  They, they ended up describing.  It was, had to be Howard University under Charlie Houston [Charles Hamilton Houston] and Jim Nabrit and others that developed the strategy for it and so forth.  Tremendous, you know it's, and Dr. Mays said, if Howard University [Washington, D.C.] has contributed nothing more than for that law school attack racism and segregation, it has more than justified itself and so forth.  But way we have underestimated the impact of that law school and turned as a quest for social justice and equality in this land you know.  So I think you gotta have both.  You gotta have the legal strategy, the legal framework 'cause you gotta have the bodies, direction action, the sit-ins and so forth, you gotta have them all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They're not mutually exclusive.  They're mutually supportive of each other.
Story_ID: 284443
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you about party affiliation ,because I believe you're a Republican or were a Republican, I don't know if you still are.  Are you still are?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: A Republican?  Were you or for a while or, or--?
Speaker 2: Never!
Speaker 1: Never, oh okay.
Speaker 2: Where you get that from?
Speaker 1: From something I read I thought that you were, you know, but I, I, okay I'm sorry (laughter).
Speaker 2: Never voted for a Republican in my life.
Speaker 1: Okay, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But I say in a partial election in Atlanta [Georgia] way back in the early '60s [1960s], two of the most liberal members of the city council, board or alderm- alderman then, the city council now, were Republican, Richard C. Freeman and Rodney C. Cook [sic. Rodney Mims Cook, Sr.] were Republicans and so forth but he had, but it was a nonpartisan election and so forth.  I'm just curious, where--did you read the--?
Speaker 1: I thought I, maybe I got you mixed up with somebody else I read, but I know it's--when you talk about, when we talk about party affiliation in the South here, there's gotta be some kind of conflict because of all the--in those days, the Dixiecrats were all Democrats.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So what was it difficult to be a Democrat here in Atlanta with that of situation where you had all these Dixiecrats here in the South?  That's before they got out of the party you know and turned and became Republicans, which is--but was it difficult?
Speaker 2: Yes, it, it was difficult.  On the other hand, for the Republicans they didn't have any power so they could say anything they wanted to.  As soon as they got power, they became Dixiecrats and so forth and the Republicans now in the South now are the heirs of the Dixiecrats you know and the Wallace-ites and all them.  They had gone to the Republican Party and so forth.  It was, it was--the question raised--it was difficult in a sense, being a Democrat for a while--for a long time actually being in the same party you know with (unclear), [Theodore G.] Bilbo and all that.  It was, it was terrible but the alternative was insignificant.  One of my major professors in 1960, and had the great battle between [Senator John Fitzgerald] Kennedy and [Vice President] Richard [Milhous] Nixon and it was really and they--of course, most blacks then voted Republican really in the presidential election.  In Atlanta, most blacks in Atlanta voted for Richard Nixon over John Kennedy and so forth.  Well, one of the great professors at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], at the Atlanta University Center [Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia], man named E.A. Jones, who wrote the book 'A Candle in the Dark[: A History of Morehouse College,' Edward A. Jones] and he voted Republican, and I was kidding him about it.  "How could you vote Republican blah blah blah with Nixon, and?"  And he looked at me and said, "Sam [HistoryMaker Samuel DuBois Cook], I simply could not pull that lever and think about [Herman] Talmadge, Bilbo," and all them and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's sad, you know.

Speaker 1: And this is a continue- and where are we at the present time?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: We're at Auburn Avenue, historic Auburn Avenue in Atlanta, Georgia, 415 as I recall.
Speaker 1: That's right, and we're continuing an interview that we started back in September, I believe, right?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 284461
Speaker 1: Well, we were talking about the Dixiecrats and the Republicans and the transition from the Dixiecrats to Republican in the South. I want to ask you more questions about the politics.  You're a professor of political science and in the early '60s [1960s] you were in Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: That's right, yes.
Speaker 1: When the Voting Rights Act [of 1965] was passed and when all the voter registration agitation was going on in registration.
Speaker 2: The Civil Rights Act of 1964 on the desk.
Speaker 1: Right, so in that regard do you have a--were the members of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference [SCLC] or Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee [SNCC] interacting with the political science professors on the black college campuses at all in those days?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes SNCC people--Lonnie [C.] King [Jr.], for example, who was head of SNCC for a while was one of my students at Atlanta University and yeah, [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond of course was a student at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  You had others in the Atlanta University system and in terms of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference it was a great deal of interaction.  [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], himself, was involved who was my classmate at Morehouse, by the way, and [HistoryMaker Reverend] Dr. [Joseph] Lowery and all them were involved, sure, sure and they were always on campus speaking, interacting, inspiring, encouraging and so forth.  It was, it was a time of great excitement, the Civil Rights Movement was a time of great social awe, incredible vitality and energy and vision and sacrifice.
Speaker 1: Now.
Speaker 2: It was a great moment to be in Atlanta [Georgia] too, which is often called the seedbed of the Civil Rights Movement, so it was very exciting.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there a story you can tell about maybe a time when there was a crisis--I mean a real, I mean a big--there was always a crisis, the whole segregation atmosphere was a crisis, but was there a time that you can think of where there was a meeting at Atlanta U [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] campus or you were summoned to a meeting to discuss a strategy or something to really handle it?
Speaker 2: On there was an occasion when we discussed a strategy involving the Committee on Appeal Students for Human Rights [sic. Committee on the Appeal for Human Rights], which was a student group in Atlanta University Center [Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia], consisting of students in all the colleges, Morehouse, Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], Atlanta University, Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia], Interdenominational Theological Center [Atlanta, Georgia], and there were countless strategy meetings, especially when students were arrested--you know and at that time you didn't know what was going to happen.  Violence could have erupted and so forth.  I remember once when the students were demonstrating down by the old railroad station on Mitchell Street, and I was in the station looking, and I heard a white fellow say the n-word--, "They're here, they're there, they're all over the place," and indeed they were all over the place.  And you didn't know what was going to happen and so forth yeah, yeah, but it was a time of great excitement.
Speaker 1: Well what happened in that particular case?
Speaker 2: Nothing really--of course, some got arrested and they stayed in a jail a while and got out.  They didn't stay in there that long, always had money to bond them out, and there were people like Jesse Hill, Jr. very active in the Civil Rights Movement here, and they put up the money.  So that was never a problem.
Story_ID: 284462
Speaker 1: One, one of the interesting things about the Civil Rights Movement, especially in Atlanta [Georgia] is that see you had not only students involved, professors and social activists and stuff, but business people were involved.  There was a sense of community in that we were all involved in this and there were some whites involved, of course, in the movement, but--
Speaker 2: From Atlanta?
Speaker 1: Yes, oh yes.
Speaker 2: Now this is an aspect of the movement we don't hear that much about, and though I want you to go back and mention some of the black business people that were involved too, but who were some of the, well who were some of the black and white people involved?  Who were some of the black business people and who were, were some of the white people?
Speaker 1: Well, Jesse Hill [Jr.] who was president of Atlanta Life [Insurance Company; Atlanta Life Financial Group, Atlanta, Georgia] was deeply involved in it as a business person and he would get a lot of money for it.  K.B. Williamson [ph.]was involved in it, he's a business person in Atlanta had an insurance company.  T.M. Alexander [Sr.] was involved, he's a big insurance executive, big realtor and so forth.  So a lot of this, a lot of them were involved.  Of course, the ministers were involved, people like Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] and Dr. William Holmes Borders, Dr. Sam Williams [Samuel Woodrow Williams] and all of them were involved and so forth.  Across denominational lines, across generation lines, secular and religion lines were intertwined.  It was really indeed a mass movement.
Speaker 2: Now, who were some of the whites involved (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Well, on the practical level, Dr. Howard Zinn who taught history at Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia] and was involved in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] and he wrote a book on SNCC, 'SNCC: The New Abolitionists' [Howard Zinn], he was very much involved.
Speaker 2: Yeah, now he's an activist, historian one of.
Speaker 1: Activist that's right.
Speaker 2: Most active in the country on a level, and but were there any native Atlanta white people that really were for civil rights, openly for civil rights or even secretly for--?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, oh yes.  A lot of them, I remember Margaret Long, who was a columnist for the Atlanta Journal [Atlanta Journal-Constitution] was very much involved and her daughter [Margaret Leonard] was involved and demonstrated, was insulted, humiliated by people who called her all kinds of names.  You can imagine the names they called her when demonstrating, and she not only demonstrated here in Atlanta, but she went to Montgomery [Alabama] and she met [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and participated in Montgomery.  You had whites who were supportive like Ralph McGill, the great editor in Atlanta Constitution [Atlanta Journal-Constitution] and publisher, and another one, Eugene Patterson, who succeeded Ralph McGill as editor of the Constitution involved.  You had generals like Pat Waters involved and so forth.  So you had, you had some whites involved in the movement.

Speaker 1: Now, what I've heard in other places, and tell me if this is true or not is that many times, I know on the Gulf Coast and Memphis [Tennessee], I've heard it said that some of the white merchants really found segregation to be a drag in terms of making money.  They couldn't really make the kind of money they could've if they actually open everything up in some way.  Was this you think a consideration of the white supporters of the movement?  I mean a person like Howard Zinn is an ideologue but what about the businessmen and people like that who, how did they--did they really think segregation was a good thing, I mean deep down inside, or did they think they could do a lot better without it?
Speaker 2: Well many of them thought it was an absolute necessity, foundation of social order in the political system in the South, men that were really racist and believed it, and there were others who believed in their heart of hearts, that even if segregation is wrong, it's bad in terms of vital self-interest, what you just suggested in terms of business, and one of the individuals who testified in favor of the Civil Rights Act [of 1964], in fact the only major deep south southern official, official to testify in favor of the Civil Rights Movement was Ivan Allen [Jr.], who at that time was mayor of Atlanta [Georgia], and his basic argument was that segregation was bad for business and that in terms of enlightened self-interest, the elimination of segregation would be, would mean economic progress and economic profits for white business entrepreneurs and so forth.  So the basic argument is one of rational and enlightened self-interest.  Of, of course, the militant segregationists wouldn't buy that kind of argument.  They would come hell or high water, they wanted racism and a rigid Jim Crow system.  They, they believed in segregation with all their hearts, and they were just absolutely terrible, of course just saying that and they would do anything.  You know as and I, you and I discussed in our previous session, one of the things about racism is that it was a total philosophy.  Not merely a political system, an economic system but also a moral system, a religious system and many of the racists believed, segregationists believed that God was a segregationist, in fact, the first segregationists.  They believed with all their heart that, that the whole system taught them that.  And this is what made Jim Crow so hard to dislodge.  I mean they--Dr. [George] Kelsey, who taught philosophy and religion at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] used to say that racism is a form of religion, it's a search for meaning and fulfillment and it's a rival to the Christian faith, and it perverted Christianity in terms and if God himself were racist.
Speaker 1: I've never heard it put like that before.  That's interesting--a search for fulfillment and enlightenment.
Speaker 2: And meaning.
Speaker 1: And meaning.
Speaker 2: They founding meaning and fulfillment in terms of racism and this is what it such a terrible thing to dismantle, to undermine.  I remember--excuse me--I remember a lady named Helen Bullard who was the campaign manager for Mayor [William B.] Hartsfield in two of three of his campaigns, political campaigns, and Helen Bullard is a decent individual and she was at our house one night for dinner.  It was just wonderful, and we were talking about racism, what it means, the dimensions of racism and she taught me a great lesson.  She, she said to me, she said, "Sam [HistoryMaker Samuel DuBois Cook], you, you don't understand."  She said, "For racism, for the racist, if you question segregation, you question racism, you question the whole value system, religious, political, everything."  And if you, she said, "If you reject that system, you reject everything that we were raised to affirm."  And I, I Dr. Kelsey later wrote a book on Christianity and the understanding and race, and others have written books on this and [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and, and they emphasized the same thing.  But this lady taught me that once you question racism in the South, Old South you question everything they believe.  You question their politics, their sociology, their religion, their morals, their social ethnics, their folk ways and mores. Everything hinges upon the affirmation of racism, and this has made the system so iniquitous, so treacherous, so horrible.
Story_ID: 284464
Speaker 1: I was going to ask about, oh I had a question about Dr. [W.E.B.] Du Bois' legacy at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  Do you think there was a lingering legacy that he left behind at Atlanta U [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], or when was--when he left, did he take it all with it or--?
Speaker 2: No, he left a strong legacy, he left Harold Reed [ph.] there and that, that legacy--a lot of students wrote their M.A. theses on Du Bois.  One of my classmates, Arthur Johnson, who's now who is retired and is a great civil rights leader in Detroit, [Michigan] president and executive director of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and he wrote his dissertation, M.A. thesis, under Ardie Reed, and wrote it on Du Bois.  And Du Bois was a great influence on their lives, so that legacy was there.  In terms of the studies, for example, Du Bois was a great pioneer trailblazer in terms of studies of the black community, the black church and all those kind of things.  He was very active in that kind of thing, and Du Bois is a great statement that the problem of the 20th century, is the problem of the color line, almost every black social scientist has adopted that philosophy and it's so profound and so true. [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin has just you know, just celebrated his ninetieth birthday and his autobiography ['Mirror to America: The Autobiography of John Hope Franklin,' John Hope Franklin] just came out.  I'm just reading it.  It said, "Du Bois not only write about the 20th century but the problem of the 21st century and the problem of the color line."  And in his autobiography, in Dr. John Hope Franklin's autobiography, he talks about the depth and persistence of racism--, "No matter what side of the bed you get up on," says Dr. Franklin, "you're black, period."  So even now, but that's the Du Bois legacy, very much alive.
Speaker 1: Now, for (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And we better not forget it either.
Story_ID: 284465
Speaker 1: Now as a political science professor during those days here in Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], what was--did you have a specialty, something that you were focusing on more than anything else in terms of your teaching and writing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well my--technically speaking, my specialty was and is political philosophy--the great tradition of Aristotle and Plato, and John Locke and [Jean-Jacques] Rousseau and all that in American political thought and so forth. But you couldn't be black, teach at a black (unclear) a black university or college [HBCU] and not be involved in the black community and black values, black quests, and black struggles.  So, much of my research dealt with the black, the blacks in the political systems, blacks in social justices of social justice.  I, I wrote several things involving voting and so forth, the white primary, blacks in the Old South, and the tyranny of racism.  So I had to get involved in all of that, and I was involved not only as a scholar but also as an activist in, in demonstrating, boycotting and all that.  That was all part of the system in Atlanta [Georgia] in the late '50s [1950s] and early '60s [1960s].
Story_ID: 284466
Speaker 1: You were, you were here, in Atlanta [Georgia] here, until 1966, right?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: How did you come to, now this is--here we have like this history-making event where you were hired at Duke University [Durham, North Carolina] in '66 [1966] but as the first black teacher at Duke and the first black teacher in any of these all-white schools in the South, right?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: All right, now how did this happen?  How did this take place?
Speaker 2: Well, to tell the truth, it happened through a, the network, the same way that whites get invited to teach in places.  I delivered a paper at the Southern Political Science Association in Gatlinburg, Tennessee on the foundation of political obligation and when I finished that paper, a man walked up to me and congratulated me.  He said he was impressed with it and so forth and very generous in his praise, and I said, "What is your name?"  He said, "I'm John [H.] Hallowell of Duke."  I said, "John."  I had read his books and he's a great believer in the Christian basis of political action and political thought and so forth, and he believed bringing in the Christian prospective to bare upon political thought.  And I just admired him so much, and he was one of these awesome figures in the field of political thought in this country, one of the seminal thinkers and when John Hallowell told me he was John Hallowell, I almost collapsed.  And here he was commending me for my paper at the Association.  So we developed a friendship and I got this letter from Dr. Hallowell in 19--it had to be in '65 [1965] saying he wanted me to invite me to serve as a visiting professor at, at Duke.  Well, you know I thought he was just being nice and this, that and the other so I didn't pay attention to it at all.  Then he wrote me another letter and said, "Look, why don't you answer my letter?  We want you at Duke."  And then I saw he was really serious about it, I spoke to Dr. [Rufus E.] Clement, who was then the president of Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], and Dr. Gerard [ph.], my dean, about going to Duke as a, as a visiting professor and so forth, but that how it happened, through in a sense networking.  In addition to, I'm sure that Dr. Hallowell, who's a very sensitive man, and who, by the way, was known as a conservative, but who believed in the Christian faith and human dignity and human equality beyond racial line.  So he, when he selected me, a black you know, some people just couldn't believe it, John Hallowell, of (unclear), but it was his, his brief, and that's how I--how it happened.  It was through friendship and scholarship, you know professional association--that's how I got that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you started at a visiting professor?
Speaker 2: Yes, I went there as a visiting professor, but (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was your reason?
Speaker 2: Before I, before-it's this funny thing, a friend of mine at Duke told another friend of mine at Duke, said, "Look, Duke is not going to let Sam Cook [HistoryMaker Samuel DuBois Cook] leave.  They're going to keep him."  And I said you know, they're just talking this, that and the other, but that was a part of the plan to get with it you know.  I'd go as a visiting, and the very first semester I was there and there was some things going on at Atlanta University and between the president and myself and this, that and the other and so forth, but Duke came and offered me a regular position that was second semester so forth and gave me tenure and everything you know.
Speaker 1: So they just--they gave you tenure and all that right away?
Speaker 2: That's right away, yeah, right away and so forth.
Speaker 1: So they wanted to make sure you were locked in securely.
Speaker 2: Locked in and so forth, and (laughter), it's, it's painful in a sense to say this, but actually I, when I went to Duke, although I had been offered a leave from Atlanta University, and the president, for his own reasons revoked the proposed leave and said I couldn't go.  And I thought it was a matter of my own integrity involved, so I went anyway, and of course, I didn't have a job (laughter) at Atlanta University you know but that, and that's another reason why of course Duke was eager to keep me.
Story_ID: 284467
Speaker 1: Well, tell us this now what was your reception like on the campus?  I mean, how were you treated?  I know that the department wanted you, but how did the--this is Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina], you know, so I don't know.  I mean what happened?  What was it like?
Speaker 2: Well it was a really a heartwarming experience, and was a you know at that time, it was the Civil Rights Movement, so liberals were excited and I'm sure there were some conservatives who were some concerned.  But they didn't express any opposition whatsoever.  And I was welcomed, in fact, the first day, my department chair, Dr. [John H.] Hallowell said to me, "Want me to go to class with you?"  I said, "Oh no, I said my--the students and I are going to get along just fine.  I'm not going to have any problems with students."
Speaker 1: Now just a question, did they have any black students on the campus at the time?
Speaker 2: They had that very year, I mean '63 [1963] rather, they had, they had Duke admitted ten blacks, nine came in '63 [1963], so they were seniors my first year there in '66 [1966].  So Duke had, I guess, the nine were still there--nine black students, undergraduates.  They had some in graduate school, but nine undergraduates and so forth.  So I told Dr. Hallowell the students and I will get along quite well.  And students were excited, in fact you know it's hard to believe that for almost all the students at Duke none of them had had a black professor and they were excited, and they would bring their parents to my class, their grandparents to my class, even their girlfriend and boyfriend--could bring them to class and so forth.  So I had some kind of phenomenon but they had never, and they you know Duke kids were from, though Duke is in North Carolina, kids from all over the country, all over the world really, but so many from New York, you know Boston [Massachusetts], all of New England, California, all over, but they never been exposed to a black professor.
Speaker 1: Now, did you ever have some resistance among the faculty, staff or the students?  I mean did they mount any kind of resistance to having this kind of change?
Speaker 2: No, none whatsoever.  On the very opposite we were invited to so many dinners and parties, my wife [Sylvia F. Cook] and I had to cut back. We couldn't make them all.  They were just, just gracious to us and so forth.  Now, it, the, the issue did come up in the first meeting of the Board of Trustees in '66 [1966] when I went there.  The Board I think met in October.  And I was told that one trustee got up and said, "I understand that you got a Negro on the faculty here."  Said, what, you know what's he doing here?"  And one fellow said, "I think I need to say something here."  He said, "My granddaughter is in Dr. Cook's [HistoryMaker Samuel DuBois Cook] class and she's impressed.  She said he's a great professor."  Another one said, the chair of the Board named [Wright] Tisdale, who's the vice president of Ford Motor Company, said, "I better say something here," said, "my son Boyd [Tisdale], is in Dr. Cook's class, and Boyd said Dr. Cook is the best professor he's had at Duke, he's ever had."  And then someone else said something nice about me.  And that, you know, that was that.  But you know I often wondered, said what would have happened had those students disliked me rather than liked me and so forth, had they opposed me rather than supported me and so forth, what would have happened?  And then it's an interesting question and so forth.  I don't think the Board would have done anything but it would have made it a little difficult for me and so forth, but the faculty was gracious to me.  My students I said you know I just loved those students at Duke they were just so supportive, and as a matter-of-fact, my classes were always full and overflowing.  The students were coming, trying to get in the class and trying to get their friends in my class, and my third semester at Duke, the students selected me as one of the best professors and one of the greatest honors of my life when that happened and so forth.  But the experience was, was great.
Story_ID: 284468
Speaker 1: Okay so, 1966, you're at Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina] basically you--when did you get tenure and all that?  I mean did it happen right away?
Speaker 2: That very next year.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that was '67 [1967] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the first year I go it and, and it went into effect the next year.
Speaker 1: Sixty-seven [1967]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah '67 [1967] yeah.
Speaker 1: All, all right; now, were you pulled into the discussion of the Vietnam War at all in those days?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was, you almost had to take a stand in, in that and so forth.  So I, I was involved in that too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Although I had some ambiguities involved in it, and so forth and at first, I, I must confess, I was, I was torn myself on it and I should never forget I saw my dear friend, classmate, [Reverend] Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in Washington [D.C.] at the Washington Hilton Hotel.  He was preparing for the, a Poor People's March [Poor People's Campaign] and so forth, the last time I saw him, frankly. And when I saw him in the lobby and ran up and hugged him, we hugged each other and he said to me, said "You were, here's my political advisor, Sam Cook [HistoryMaker Samuel DuBois Cook]." And said, I told him, "You don't listen to me."  I said you know, "We can have both beer, bread, and guns.  We can have both and so forth."  And, you know, I suggested he ought to back off a little, and as it turns out of course, he was profoundly right and I was profoundly wrong and then when I found out that he was right, I opposed the war.  But, at first, I supported, I thought, I supported [President] Lyndon [Baines] Johnson.  And I must confess, I had, you know I had certain conflicts because Lyndon Johnson supported civil rights and I thought I'd give him the benefit of the doubt.  But I missed the whole point that Dr. King was making.  When I say, we can support both guns and butter, both the war and domestic policy, I was speaking a material terms. But M.L. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], Dr. King, was speaking in deeper terms.  What he was saying, it's a matter of priority, it's a matter of focus, a matter of prospectus, perspective, it's a matter of commitment.  That if you concentrate on the war, even partly, you're going to miss something in terms of domestic policy and civil rights and so forth, and he was right.  That you can't have two supreme priorities, you gotta make a choice and he had the moral courage to make the right choice to begin with, and I'm glad to say I learned from him.  But, at first, I supported the war.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess so, the major contradiction being us being over in a war for someone else's freedom when people here are not free.
Speaker 2: Precisely, precisely.  Course that was quite different from the war, the tragedy of misadventures, the preemptive war we're in now in Iraq [Iraq War].  It's quite different and so forth, but, yeah, but Dr. King had great, great insight.  He was just, he was just, he's a moral genius, the only moral genius this country has produced.
Story_ID: 284469
Speaker 1: What was the--so you taught political theory basically historical--the history of political thought and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: That's right the history, and contemporary political thought and so forth, you knoe.
Speaker 1: Did you use Arnold Brecht's book, 'Political Theory[: The Foundations of Twentieth Century Political Thought']?' (Laughter) I just asked 'cause that's what I (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, right I used to yeah, no, it's a great book.  It's a great book.
Speaker 1: Brecht, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Arnold Brecht, yeah, great book.  I didn't use it in the text, but I used it to influence students and referred them and so forth, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you teach I mean any other courses at during those days or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, ironically, when I worked at Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina], I taught out of my field, I built my reputation by teaching advanced students a course on political parties and so forth.  I taught American government and things like that, but in terms of advanced course, I taught American political parties, and American party system and so forth which was quite, quite interesting and so forth.  Yeah, yeah I taught outside of my specialty.  The next year, of course, I taught in my specialty and even the second semester, I even had a, a seminar which met in my office.  I had to select students and had a seminar on Aristotle and Plato, and two of my most outstanding students were in my class and we're still very good friends, one is a judge in DeKalb County [Georgia] out here from North Carolina and the other one owns a television station in Florida, Orlando, Florida and so forth.  So we maintain friendship through, throughout the years, yeah.
Story_ID: 284470
Speaker 1: In terms of what was going on in the late '60s [1960s], did you feel--oh, did you feel--were you a supporter of [President] Lyndon [Baines] Johnson in the 1968?  I know he, the, the anti-war movement really was pushing him around '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: When you went to Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina] and did people like in Minnesota--you know who I'm talking about?
Speaker 2: Hubert Humphrey?
Speaker 1: Well, Humphrey, but you had the other one too, Gene?
Speaker 2: McCarthy?
Speaker 1: Eugene McCarthy and, yeah.
Speaker 2: Eugene, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: He came out first against the war big and ran for president and declared his nomination.  Then Humphrey, after, after--I think Gene McCarthy kinda pushed Johnson to kind of advocate, he, he didn't wanna--he announced he wasn't going to run in '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Yes, I was hoping Johnson would run because I still think he's--I still think he is the greatest friend that blacks and the civil rights have had in the White House.  I mean he put it on the line.  Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] gave moral support to it, but he didn't put it on the line.  Lyndon Johnson put it on the line.  Of course he had the advantage of using the capital of Kennedy's death and legacy, he had it all, but Lyndon Johnson was really committed to it.  I mean he talked about, they talk about how persuasive he was and how he would put the screws on people.  He put the screws on for, for civil rights too.  I still think he's the greatest friend blacks have had in the White House with the possible exception of Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton], and so forth, but Clinton had to build on Johnson's legacy.  I'm still a great admirer of Lyndon Johnson.
Speaker 1: Okay, there are some, there was some criticisms of Johnson that were written in those days.  Do you recall a book by [HistoryMaker] Samuel Yette, 'The Choice: The Issue of Black Survival in America'?  I think he kind of, I think that's probably the deepest criticism of, in, in the black community you know that well, the idea was as people say today about the war, the--that Vietnam [the Vietnam War], that today's, that the Iraq War is also like paying people off you know with tax money.  There was a criticism that the Vietnam War also you know made it, enriched you know some of the politicians over here by growing rice.  You know a lot of southern senators started growing rice and we were bombin' the rice patties and all that sort of things.  We--do you have any thoughts on that?
Speaker 2: No, I, I must confess I have not read yet the book, I know about it but I haven't read it, so I can't comment on that.
Speaker 1: That's probably the deepest criticism I know of Lyndon Johnson but you're right nobody you know there was no other politician that supported civil rights, you know something like the Voting Rights Act [of 1965] and you know that had that much teeth in it.
Speaker 2: When he delivered his speech supporting the Voting Rights Act, and he ended it with we shall overcome, I mean that was just, just classic.  And he used all his considerable, his massive political skills.  I don't know anyone else who could have gotten that legislation, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which in affect reinstituted the Fourteenth Amendment then the Voting Rights Act of '65 [1965], which in effect reinstituted the Fifteenth Amendment.  Who could have done it other than Lyndon Johnson?  I mean he used all his skills and so forth.  He put the bite on people.  I mean, he really, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 284471
Speaker 1: Now do you remember what you were doing on the day that you found out that [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated?
Speaker 2: Yes, indeed, I was--I taught my courses, and I went home.  We were living on campus at Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina] and Dr. Leslie [W.] Dunbar, who had been head of the Southern Regional Council here in Atlanta [Georgia], a number of years, and who at that time was president of Field Foundation [New York, New York], called me oh I guess around three o'clock and said "Sam [HistoryMaker Samuel DuBois Cook], turn on the television."  Said, "Martin has been shot."  And I said to him very frank I said just on a hunch, "There is no point in me turning it on, he's dead," just like that.  I said, you know he's dead and I, you know I, I brooded over it, I couldn't believe it and yet I had to believe it, and that night several friends, came by the--white, came by the house, the political department, one was named John Strange, he was in my department, political science and he said to me, "Sam," said "how do you take it?  How do you take it, all of this and what blacks had been through and so forth and then here they killed Dr. King?" and this, that and the other and I disgustingly responded to it, and then the paper called me, The Duke Chronicle [The Chronicle] called me to get my comment, and I must of course say, his death brought me closer to bitterness than anything that ever happened in my life.  I mean I was angry, I was bitter, and I said to the press when they called me, I said, "Every white racist has had his finger on that trigger that killed Dr. King."  I said, "Racism killed him." I mean I was really and so forth.  Some people were shocked because I was so, you know.  So, it was on--I, I was on the edge of real bitterness.  No, there's no question about it.  So a neighbor of mine, who is in the history department called and said, "Sam, I wanna borrow some of your records that featured Dr. King."  Said, "We need to do something to honor Dr. King, and in memory of Dr. King."  And I, his name was Fred Krantz, and I said to Fred Krantz, "Fred, your white folk killed Dr. King.  You do something," you know.  "Don't, don't call on me to do it."  I said, "You do something."  I said, "I'll let you have the record, but I'm not going to participate in it."  And I was really, I was upset.  So you know I, I brooded it over and then I came down to Atlanta the next day to visit the King family and so forth, and I went back to Duke and I had a, I had a note saying, "Bring some food and some assorted drinks to the quad," that's in front of the great Duke [University] Chapel [Durham, North Carolina].  It said, "We're over there, just bring some over."  I had no idea what to, what was going on, but I said well I'd soften you know I'd gotten my thoughts together.  I knew it was just a service to Dr. King and his legacy, M.L. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] we called him.  To be, be bitter so I, I discussed with my wife [Sylvia F. Cook] and I said, "I'm going to take, I'm gonna take some food over, I'm gonna take some soft drinks over for the chapel."  I put--so I went to the store and got some soft drinks and got some food and went om to the chapel.  And there Campus Drive is the main entrance to Duke and it goes directly in front of the chapel and I drove down Campus Drive and I got near the chapel in the car and I saw all those students, a there were few faculty people, and a couple administrators, out there on that quad honoring Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. It was a sight, it's a sight Mr. [Larry] Crowe that I will go to my grave with.  I, I just couldn't believe it.  So I not only delivered the food, and drinks, I parked my car, and joined the group on the quad.  Those students and a few faculty, they stayed on that quad, day in and day out for almost two weeks, in the rain, honoring Dr. King.
Story_ID: 284472
Speaker 1: So I was there [Duke University Chapel, Durham, North Carolina], and I, I came down to Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] funeral and when I went back, they asked me to address this quad.  They called it the Vigil in honor of Dr. King and asked me to speak to the group and so forth.  Of course, I did so, and I said, I said, "The other night after Dr. King was assassinated, John Strange asked me, 'How do you take it, Sam [HistoryMaker Samuel DuBois Cook]?  How do you--,' 'cause we were Negroes and everything, 'take all of this and now with Dr. King?  You know everything you've gone through and now they killed Dr. King, how do you take it?'"  And I said, "I couldn't answer John Strange's question that night but I can answer now looking at you."  And I went on to tell them that how they had restored my faith and how a moment of great tragedy and heartache, they had provided roses for my soul, and they recorded that speech and played it over and over and so forth.  But it was a moment you know, but that, that's how I responded to Dr. King's tragic assassination at that time.  It, it almost destroyed my hope and faith, really yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: And could you relate to the rioters--all the riots that broke out?  Could you relate to how people felt?
Speaker 1: Oh, sure, sure, I felt you know almost the same way, and I would not have been violent about it you know but in terms of the anger and the hostility and, the, the and the bitterness and so forth, so I could under- I could under- I could understand it.  And then we had some in Durham [North Carolina], you know we had some in Durham.  In fact, they declared--one night I was leaving the quad, leaving the demon- not demonstration the vigil to honor Martin Luther King, you know, I was going home and I was stopped by the troopers and they had their machine guns you know and all that stuff.  So I understood, I understood you know.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, now do you have any thoughts about who, how, who assassinated Dr. King I mean being a native of Atlanta [Georgia] and being in the political science group?  I mean have, do you have any thoughts about that?
Speaker 1: No, I accept the official version.  I don't, I, I can't accept their conspiratorial theories of--there are so many conspiratorial theories, I don't and one of the reasons why I accept the official version of the Warren Commission and so forth is that, you know, had there been some conspiracy or some evidence that someone did it other than the person accused, Bobby Kennedy [Senator Robert F. Kennedy] would have haunted them, would have gone all over world and so forth and the Kennedy family, especially Bobby would have done so and he accepted the official version.  So I said if Bobby Kennedy could do it as much as cared about his brother [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] and as sharp and as clever and as determined as he was, I can accept it too.  So I don't believe in the conspiratorial theory of history and there are so many of them.  I just don't see any evidence of any conspiracy and so forth.  I think a lot of people would have killed him, of course.  But I think the official version of the Warren Commission is about as accurate as you're going to get.

Speaker 1: Now, tell me about your, your teaching at Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina].  What were some of the highlights of your academic life at Duke and otherwise you know, and how long were you at Duke as a teacher?
Speaker 2: I was there until from 19--August 1966 until December 1974.  Although I was on leave for a couple of years with the Ford Foundation in New York [New York], but teaching at Duke was a great experience.  I developed a lot of friendships.  I was--I had great colleague and they put me on every committee and so forth, and later I got--they put me on the Board of Trustees, still a trustee emeritus.  They gave me an honorary degree and for a while I was at Dillard [University, New Orleans, Louisiana] and so forth, and subsequent they established a society in my honor and the idea is to mentor blacks at Duke and since then, and they have a mentoring program.  They have an annual lecture.  They have an annual dinner.  They have a reception--they do the things you know in my name, [HistoryMaker] Samuel DuBois Cook, and so forth and so they've done everything you know just that and one of my great joys is to go back there every year for a meeting with the [Samuel DuBois Cook] Society and for the dinner and so forth, just one little sparkling and heartwarming experiences, so you know (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, there's a Samuel DuBois Cook Society at Duke I believe.
Speaker 2: That's it, that's it yeah.
Speaker 1: Formed by the students, black students, right?
Speaker 2: No, this is by the university.
Speaker 1: It's, it's, oh, everybody, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the university, yeah--the President said started it in 1997, the year I retired.
Story_ID: 284474
Speaker 1: Well, getting back to--now in 1974 now what happened, is this when you went to Dillard [University, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1974 is when I made the most difficult decision in my life to leave Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina] because I had planned to retire there.  We had a wonderful home and we had wonderful friends and all of that, but I had to--and when Duke, not Duke, when Dillard inquired about my interests, I said, "No."  I wasn't interested.  They called me back in two or three months and I said, "I'm not interested.  I'm committed to teaching," which is true.  You know I always felt that teaching is so much more divine, and Morris R. Cohen said, than administration.  I wasn't interested in being anyone's administrator (unclear).  So what I didn't know was that my saying no to them accentuated their interest in, in me.  They said we want someone who is not seeking the position and doesn't want it and so forth.  So this went on for some eight months and so forth before I considered even talking to them about it, and then seeing the thing and all that.  Then finally talked to me about it at Duke and I was impressed, but then I went on that campus, beautiful campus and the you know the sadness now of [Hurricane] Katrina and how it destroyed, devastated the campus and I'm told, I haven't seen it.  But one morning, you know they had a great architecture and beautiful greening campus.  I went on that campus--and a beautiful day really--and I got a flashback of Dr. [Benjamin] Mays, Benjamin Elijah Mays, my great mentor at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], I saw him on that campus at Morehouse, dashing from his office, from his home to his office (unclear), and I said to me, "You know, I said if I can do one-tenth for the students at Dillard that Dr. Mays did for us at Morehouse then I know that my living will not be in vain," and that changed my mind on it.  When I got back to Atlanta [Georgia], I told Dr. Mays, I said, "Dr. Mays, you tricked me."  He said, "What happened?  You talking differently now than you talked back then."  I said, "You tricked me," I said, "That flashback."  And it's true.  When I saw that flashback of Dr. Mays walking on the Morehouse campus, that's when I said, "Yes, sir," you know, "if you elect me president, I'll accept."
Story_ID: 284475
Speaker 1: Did you try to pattern your presidency after Dr. [Benjamin] Mays in that sense?
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: Or did everything, did things still work like that or?
Speaker 2: No, it's just I should have known you would ask that question.  Yes, I did.  Some may think I did.  As a matter of fact, I said, and my friend, my classmate, who was executive editor at the time of Jet at the time, Bob Johnson [Robert E. Johnson].  I'm sure you knew Bob Johnson.  Bob quoted me and said, "I want to be a mini Benny."  And one of my colleagues criticized me in that sense--instead of trying be a mini Benny, you ought to want to be maxi Samuel and so forth, I said but Dr. Mays--
Speaker 1: And that's referring to Benjamin Mays' nickname, right?  What did they call him?
Speaker 2: Benny, yeah, well-it's Bennett, Buck Benny.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Buck Benny, that's right.
Speaker 2: Buck Benny, yeah, and said you want to, you ought to want to be maxi, a maxi Samuel, rather than a mini Benny."  Well I tried to model mine after Dr. Mays and I was president for twenty-two and a half years.  This fellow who criticized me was president for about two years and he was out and so forth.  But I, I did.  Dr. Mays had a great sense of time and always on time or ahead of time.  I asked Dr. Mays when I went to Dillard [University, New Orleans, Louisiana], I said, "What time did you go to your office" And he said, "I'm always there on time you know, eight o'clock," said "I was there."  (Unclear) say, well I said when I go to ask three or four presidents when they got there and they told me, one told me about nine and the other one told me about ten and so forth.  So I decided I would follow Dr. Mays, so I was in my office every morning for twenty-two and a half years, when I was there for anywhere from seven thirty to twenty minutes of eight, sure I got there early no matter what and so forth.  And I gotta tell you this, one of my dear friends at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] a class--a schoolmate from--Lerone Bennett Jr. [HistoryMaker Lerone Bennett], who you know, and we're still very dear friends--Lerone called me one Christmas Eve, about six o'clock, called the house and I wasn't there--Sylvia [F. Cook], my wife, told him that I was in my office working, which I was.  He called Dr. Mays and said, "Dr. Mays, Sam Cook [HistoryMaker Samuel DuBois Cook] is at his office working."  Said, "Will you call him and tell him to go home and be with his wife and his two young kids [Samuel DuBois Cook, Jr. and Karen J. Cook] on Christmas Eve?"  And see that I got it.  Do you know what Dr. Mays said?
Speaker 1: What did he say?
Speaker 2: Dr. Mays said, "Mr. Bennett, I don't know what I can do for that, sir. I got a few things to do myself," (laughter).  So, he was working.
Story_ID: 284476
Speaker 1: Off-camera we were talking about, we were telling the story about how some students took over the administration building when Dr. King, I mean, Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] and [Dr.] Benjamin Mays were locked in the administration building [at Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] by a group of students who were protesting who were kind of shocked to know they were there and didn't know what to do after they--but you heard a similar story?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, [HistoryMaker] Grayson Mitchell tells a story in his interview with us, in case somebody watching this wants to hear the full thing, but you concur the same thing. They were at the horns of a dilemma; they didn't know what to do.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So at Dillard University [New Orleans, Louisiana], you're, you're president and you get there early in the morning every, every day.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What other things did you do that were similar to Benjamin Mays?
Speaker 2: Well, I worked on weekends, holidays and so forth.  I worked hard.  Another thing Dr. Mays spoke in my inauguration, and Dr. Mays looks through an individual and he said to me, "Though it's against your nature to do it, I'm going to say it anyway.  Never use Dillard as a stepping stone to anything," and when he said it, really it went through me.  I could never consider leaving Dillard with that.  I figured I'd be cursed, he put the curse on me so forth, but the way he said it and the way he looked at me and paused.  He says, "It's against your nature, but never use Dillard as a stepping stone to anything," and you know, "do it as though God sent you here and so forth."
Speaker 1: You have the implication that it is, that it's a sacred trust?
Speaker 2: Absolutely!
Speaker 1: To be president of this black college [HBCU].
Speaker 2: Absolutely, sacred trust, and so forth.  Another thing that Dr. Mays did that I patterned my administration after.  It's a matter of time--Dr. Mays had a great sense of time, never late and you'd better not be late.  When he was teaching at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], way back in the early '20s [1920s], teaching mathematics, he would close the door and (unclear) legend had it that he said to a young man, "One foot was in the door and the other was out, you can't come in," he used his Boston [Massachusetts] accent, "You can't come in" and so forth.  You know a lot of people started to meeting on time on this, that and the other.  Dr. Mays always started on time and at Dillard, it was legendary.  They said "Well, Sam Cook [HistoryMaker Samuel DuBois Cook] is going to start, so you'd better be there."  And I would tell freshmen when they came, "When we say two o'clock we really mean five minutes or ten minutes of two, don't come late, just don't (unclear)."  So we started a program, I did it deliberately a few minutes early, so people get in the habit and they got in the habit and they were there on time and so forth.  And one of my and this is hard to believe, the first black fellow judge in the history of the South, Bob Collins [Robert Frederick Collins], was a Dillard grad, and we were to honor him by giving him an honorary degree, doctor of law.  When the procession was ready to start, he wasn't there, and I said, "The procession will proceed," and we left without him.  And I shall never forget, here is the first black judge in South running across the campus trying to catch up with the academic procession. And rushing, but we started on time and so forth.  Time is important.  Dr. Mays said time has swift wings and he's right.  Therefore, so I tried to in--my charges to students, you know Dr. Mays talked about integrity that the man who starts to race behind has to run faster than the man in front or forever remain behind.  Well that was my--I say the same thing.  I quote him all the time.  He has said so many, there's so many wonderful things.  If you're weak, folk will exploit you.  If you're ignorant, they'll take advantage of you and if you're coward, they will keep you running.  I use to tell the students this all the time, and I've written several things on Dr. Mays and I gather so many of these quotations that are useful to me, have meaning and that's a part of the texture of my own life and being.
Story_ID: 284477
Speaker 1: What was your biggest challenge at Dillard [University, New Orleans, Louisiana]?  What condition was it in when you came in and what was your biggest challenge there?
Speaker 2: I was saying, as Dr. [Benjamin] Mays once said, to make a good institution better, to make a greater institution greater.  Dillard had an excellent reputation academically.  It had an excellent--it had an outstanding financial situation.  It had never had--under Dr. [Albert Walter] Dent who finished Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] in 1926, was a very good friend of Dr. Mays, Dillard never had a deficit.  And Dr. Dent went there in 1941, never had a deficit and had a philosophy - you don't spend what you don't have.  And that philosophy seeped into the consciousness of Dillard and when I went there, I built on that reputation and his business manager became my vice president for fiscal affairs, [HistoryMaker] Dr. Charles Teamer [Sr.] and a very able individual, and we never, we never had a deficit.  We increased the endowment from less than five million [dollars] to almost fifty million [dollars] while we were there and so forth.  So we tried to strengthen the physical situation, tried to improve the academic situation and things like that, but so my challenge was overall to increase the endowment, improve the academic quality of the institution, to make be Dillard a little more visible, to make it overall a better place.  Dr. Mays said, "That the challenge of a success is always to leave an institution better than you found it," and that was my philosophy.  I did my best to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay, was there--did Dillard have an academic specialty when you were there?
Speaker 2: You know it's a good liberal arts school but it had the first accredited program of nursing in the whole State of Louisiana and one of its most distinctive with a great tradition in nursing.  It had an outstanding hospital, Flint-Goodridge [Hospital, New Orleans, Louisiana], like Provident [Hospital; Provident Hospital of Cook County] in Chicago [Illinois] and Homer G. Phillips [Hospital] in St. Louis [Missouri].  There were, they were the three of the great black hospitals in the country, and I tried to improve that, but it ran into some difficulties in with competition from the other hospitals there.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the hospital again?
Speaker 2: Flint-Goodridge.
Speaker 1: Flint, okay.
Speaker 2: F-L-I-N-T, G-O-O-D-R-I-G-E, hyphenated.  So it had a tradition to have the first prog- first department of drama at a historical black college [HBCU] so it was outstanding in that, in that regard too.
Speaker 1: Now was that created while you were there?
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, it was created way back in the '30s [1930s] and so forth, but its fiscal soundness is one of the great traditions at Dillard and academic excellence and so forth.  So my job was tough and easy.  It was tough to maintain those kinds of standards to improve upon them and so forth, easy in that I had a model to go by and a tradition to adhere to and so forth and a certain built-in momentum and so forth.  You know you have a, you go to a school that has a tradition of fiscal irresponsibility, that's in financial trouble, so that you worry about meeting payroll, you can't do much thinking; you can't make much progress there and so forth.  That wasn't true at Dillard, it wasn't true.  And it had one of the most beautiful campuses in the whole world, at least it had I should say that and yeah.
Speaker 1: So most of it was destroyed in the?
Speaker 2: Yeah, just devastated but a beautiful campus, gorgeous. White buildings, nothing but white buildings and so forth, architecture.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Hurricane Katrina in 2005 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. That's--yeah.
Story_ID: 284478
Speaker 1: Is there, what's the--would you consider the highlight of your presidency there?  What was the biggest event?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's, that's difficult.  I suppose one of the highlights was to develop a university scholars program whereby we attracted outstanding students from throughout the country.  We gave them full scholarships; you know it had to be competitive you know.  You can't say come to Dillard [University, New Orleans, Louisiana] when other schools are offering them all kind of resources, all kind of opportunities and all kinds of financial aid.  So the university scholars program meant full tuition, it meant room and board, it meant in a sense a free ride, but you had to be good.  But students turned down Ivy League schools to come to Dillard to be university scholars.  You know we built it up where you know the students would say, "I always wanted to be a university scholar.  This inspired me and the challenge," and so forth, and those young men and women came to Dillard and to see them sparkle, just to see them excel, and to see them excited about academic enterprise, just to see and hear them dream about what they plan to do with their lives ten, fifteen, twenty years was a source of unending joy.  It was really, it made the whole enterprise significant and worthwhile, and some of them became doctors and lawyers, scholars all over.  As I move about the country now, it's, it's a such a great pride to see them and how they have excelled and so forth.  So I suppose that's the greatest freedom to see those university scholars and so forth.  And, of course, it was a, a thrill to, to improve the faculty. To see young faculty members come and be productive, write books, write scholarly articles, participate in professional meetings. You know, that was, that was a special joy too.
Story_ID: 284479
Speaker 1: Do you have any favorite, I guess, students or staff members over the years?  I don't want to get you in trouble, but, you know--
Speaker 2: I'm not going to call names; yes, I have some (laughter).   Yeah, I have some, I have some favorites.  No question about it.  Some, just--
Speaker 1: Well just give, let's put it this way, just give us a sample of some of them because I know you love all of 'em, but just give us a sample.
Speaker 2: Well, I, I wouldn't want to call their names, you know every place I've been, I've had students a few students who were just, just outstanding academically, humanistically, socially involved I mean in terms of trying to make life better for other people, and who had integrity and so forth and they stood out at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta Georgia], Southern University [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], where I taught, at Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina], UCLA [University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] and, at Dillard [University, New Orleans, Louisiana], and they were just special.  They just, just warmed my heart knowing, you know, as, in the twilight of my life.  And I, I used to hear people talk about how their students gave meaning to their lives and so forth, and joy as they advance in age and you know I-- the feeling now and so forth.  And since you, yeah, since you-of course I can think now of two students I had in Atlanta University, Dr. Hain Walter, Jr. [ph.] who was a distinguished professor at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] has an endowed chair.  Dr. William [E.] Nelson [Jr.], full professor at [The] Ohio State University [Columbus, Ohio] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --my alma mater brings me joy. [HistoryMaker] Marian Wright Edelman who is the founder and president of the Children's Defense Fund committed her life, who was an idealist and my student, she was at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] at the time and took all my classes at Atlanta University and so forth.  Just an idealist, her (unclear) was big, I thought she was going to go off her rocker, because she was so committed to making this world better and one of the leaders of the student movement in Atlanta [Georgia] and, and so forth.  Just, just a special joy and, and you know special pride and so forth.  Margie Thomas [ph.], I mentioned her earlier, at Duke, who was in my first class at Duke, who owns a radio station in Orlando, Florida, who is committed to social justice, is on the board of the (unclear) council and so forth.  Those are examples of--Dwayne Thomas in New Orleans down in Louisiana is a head of hospital there and so forth, so just, just sources of great pride and joy and meaning and so forth, and so I never I had to worry about whether my life has been significant and meaningful.  I can look at my students and I can see why some of our professors took pride in me.  I, I see myself in my students and so forth.  They saw themselves in me.
Story_ID: 284480
Speaker 1: How long were you president of Dillard [University, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Twenty-two and a half years.
Speaker 1: Okay, so until 1996, I guess?
Speaker 2: Ninety-seven [1997].
Speaker 1: Ninety-seven [1997], all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So did you retire at that point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I retired yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On my own too (laughter).
Speaker 1: That, that didn't have to be a coup or anything.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Not any suggestions and so forth--I decided that they needed new blood, infusion of new ideas and so forth.  In addition of which, I wanted to come back, my relatives are here.  My wife's [Sylvia F. Cook] parents--mother is here.  I had at brother, who at that time was alive, he is deceased now, in Midville [Georgia], his family and wanted to come home.  I'm from a little town called Griffin [Georgia], and so forth, so I, I wanted to retire and get back and re-establish myself back here.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right okay, now you've been involved in a lot of boards and you do a lot of volunteer activity aright in terms of boards and so forth here?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were on the Board of Trustees at Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina] or you were--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm still the trustee emeritus, I'm active.
Speaker 1: --okay.
Speaker 2: I'm now chair of the Joseph E. Lowry Institute for Social, for Human Rights and Social Justice [sic. Joseph E. Lowery Institute for Justice and Human Rights; Joseph & Evelyn Lowery Institute] you know here, here in Atlanta [Georgia].  So I'm involved in a lot of things, but on my own terms.  I'm doing a lot of writing and so forth and finishing up a couple of projects, major projects.
Speaker 1: What are they books, or book projects or?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah several.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us what the contents of these projects are?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well one, one of the--I'm doing a book on Dr. [Benjamin] Mays, as you would expect.  A publisher asked me to pull together and write an introduction to some essays--I didn't realize, realize I had written so many I saved, but I wrote to Dr. Mays--I hate to mention him so much, but he's such an awesome influence in my life.  He told me when we were together to keep my scholarship alive and he tried to write an article, at least an article every year.  Well, I tried and I missed a few years but, for the most part, I wrote scholarly articles, not newspaper articles, but scholarly articles.  And, so I guess I got fifty or sixty articles, which the publisher asked me to bring together in two volumes of things I had written from 1957, when I published my first article in the American Science Political Review, the official publication of the American Political Science Association, up to an article I did last year--well, it really came out this year on Brown vs. Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], the ultimate meeting and significance.  And I got another one that will be published in the next couple of months and so forth.  So I want to bring them together and write a new introduction and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I'm trying to do that.
Story_ID: 284481
Speaker 1: Now, we always ask this question, and that is, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, I, I suppose the, the basic one is I want to see this country overcome the tragedy, and the tyranny, and the universality to racism, which it has done so much to stifle the black mind and the black spirit, so that blacks will be treated as equals--I mean absolute equal in terms of their common humanity and their citizenship.  I, I want to that, you know, I want to see blacks you know, I want to see blacks on equal plane as citizens and human beings with whites in this country.  I want to see equality as an imperative, as, as existential reality in this country.  [Gunnar] Myrdal in his book on the '[An] American Dilemma' said that "Negro [political] genius has been imprisoned in the Negro problem," and he's in large part right.  Though blacks have transcended racism to a large extent and they've made outstanding contributions, and I think of [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin and [Dr.] Benjamin Mays and this, that and the other.  I want to see this country in other words live up to its creed.  This country deserves that, blacks deserve that and so forth.  And I said earlier that John Hope Franklin in his memoir ['Mirror to America: The Autobiography of John Hope Franklin'] it talks about the continuity of racism, how it stifles and so real now, we've made great progress, but have a great distance to go.  I want to see this country go that distance, and I wanna see blacks continue to participate in their own freedom, their own emancipation.  And I want to see them reach that maximum in terms of personal responsibility; again that people like Dr. Mays, Mordecai Johnson and Howard Thurman, the great masters in black colleges have taught, we have an obligation, we cannot eliminate racism by, by ourselves but we can help and there are certain things that we can do, as human beings, to improve our lot.  We can't leave it all to the white community, we have an obligation.  You know if you look at it in terms of teen pregnancy, you know kids, mothering and fathering kids, you know, what a tragedy, the cycle of dependency and, and, and poverty and degradation.  We gotta overcome that.  So a lot of things we can do ourselves, recommit ourselves to the educational order, to learning.  You know I don't want to say too much about this, but if we read black history and look at the freedmen, after the emancipation, after the Civil War, and the passion they had for learning and the kind of sacrifices they made with nothing, the kind of opportunities they created out of almost nothing, and he we have all these opportunities and we're missing and we're missing them and wasting it.  So we're, we're being irresponsible at some degree.  So I think we have an obligation, a moral obligation, an intellectual obligation to participate in our own self-improvement.  So, America has a broader responsibility, but the black community has a special responsibility.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To itself and to this country.
Story_ID: 284482
Speaker 1: Tell me this, now when you look back at your life and all the things that you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could do it again?
Speaker 2: Oh, I suppose I would, I suppose I'd do a few things differently.  I was thinking the other day, a lot of projects I started and didn't complete, go on to something else and so forth.  I would do things like that.  I think they are peripheral things but the basic content, I wouldn't change and you know and so forth.  I would--I've always worked hard, but I think I have been, I would be more focused on completing certain tasks and so forth, certain enterprises that I, that I would want to do and so forth.
Story_ID: 284483
Speaker 1: The next question is similar to that one: when you look back at your life at this point, what would you consider today to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I (laughter), oh that, that's a difficult one.  Yeah, I would hope that my legacy would be that in the main tradition of perpetuating a sense of integrity, and honor, and decency and concern for others, getting out of the main, be confined to myself and committing myself to helping others.  I, I think life involves a vision and a commitment beyond the self.  You gotta move outside yourself to fulfill yourself and so forth, and I hope that would be a part of my legacy--a concern for others.  I tried to leave this legacy in my classroom, in my administration [presidential administration, Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana], in my civic activities, in, in my life to do something for others, the, get outside the prison of the self and focus on the dimension of existence outside the self.  One of my favorite philosophers [Josiah Royce] said, "The best world for the moral agent is one that needs him to make it better," and this says all of us need to make the world better.
Story_ID: 284484
Speaker 1: Do you wanna tell us a little bit about your family?  I don't think we really discussed your family any, but just--
Speaker 2: Sort of--
Speaker 1: Do you have children?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah, I have a wife [Sylvia F. Cook], and my wife and I have been married.  We're in our forty-sixth year.  She tolerated me for forty-six years and so forth, and I hope she'll tolerate me the rest time on this earth.  We have a son [Samuel DuBois Cook, Jr.] and a daughter [Karen J. Cook], thirty-four and thirty-two.

Speaker 1: Sir, is there anything that I have not asked that you think you need to address before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, I can't think of anything (laughter)
Speaker 1: Okay, well the last question is similar to legacy but a little different and it is--Sir, how would like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I suppose I would like to be remembered as an individual who was born in Griffin, Georgia, of parents [Mary Daniel Cook and Emanuel Cook], who though not highly educated, had great decency, great integrity, great honor, and who taught me to have integrity, honor and decency and who taught me to have integrity and honor and decency and who taught me the virtue of hard work, and who taught me to be faithful and assured me if I am decent and faithful, the Lord will make a way somehow, and I didn't have any better sense than to believe that, but they were right.

Speaker 1: So my dad [Emanuel Cook] died when I was a, a rising senior at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], died that that summer and I didn't know how I was going to make it.  My mother [Mary Daniel Cook] didn't work you know.  She had been a teacher and had stopped teaching and so forth.  I finished work that summer in the steel mills in Ohio--Youngstown, Ohio, came back to Morehouse and I needed an increase in my scholarship, academic scholarship, I was a football player.  In fact, I was captain of the team, but Morehouse said your athletic scholarship and (unclear) academic, but I needed an increase, and went to Dr. [Benjamin] Mays, my main man, and told him I needed an increase in my scholarship to cover my tuition.  'Cause I worked all summer.  My dad had died and so forth and Dr. Mays said, "No problem, fine."  So I got an increase in scholarship.  I got a scholarship to grad school, to law school, the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], the Lord made that way and I got a scholarship to [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio], the Lord made that way and so forth.  I needed some money for my meals.  I got a job serving, you know as a waiter and I was a graduate assistant, so I got money that way and so forth, but I still needed the meals and students were in my class, a couple of them when I was an assistant, and I would serve them at lunch and dinner, and they were very gracious to me you know they said "Mr. Cook [HistoryMaker Samuel DuBois Cook], I would like to have some more beans" or this, that and the other so forth, but I made it to graduate school, got a university scholarship and all kinds of honors.  The Lord made a way, I worked hard.  I tried to be decent displaying integrity that my parents had taught me and Dr. Mays had taught me and so forth but I worked hard and I made it, and you know I went into the [U.S.] Army, and no sweat.  I spent my two years in the Army and so forth.  Got out.  While in the Army, I wrote around for to get jobs.  I had fourteen offers for jobs while I was in the Army and so forth.  I got my Ph.D. while I in the Army.  So I went to my office at night and finished my dissertation at Ohio State while in the Army so and you know worked and made out, the Lord may a way for me, through my hard work too.  I had to work hard and so forth. And, and down through the grinding years, I've just been blessed, ever blessed.  I've known a lot of great individuals who have influenced my life, not only Dr. Mays, but people like Howard Thurman, [HistoryMaker Reverend] Gardner Taylor today and so forth, great friends, a friend like [Reverend] Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., you know, I've just been blessed.  But I've tried to display integrity, and decency and honor and I've tried to get beyond this prison wall of myself and give something to life and I'm, I'm a dreamer at heart. And I'm still a dreamer, and Howard Thurman, the great theologian, who happened to be a friend of mine later, used to say, "Keep alive the dream and for as long a man has a dream in his heart, he cannot lose the significance of living.  Keep alive the dream."  And that's what I've tried to do.
