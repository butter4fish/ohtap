Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask you what I call People magazine-ish type questions.
Speaker 2: Okay, um-hm.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Well, it's probably yellow and scarlet.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Christmas.

Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Favorite phrase.  Well, I've had different favorite phrases at different points in my life.  The mantra that got me through seminary [Boston University School of Theology, Boston, Massachusetts] was, "I can do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthens me" [Philippians 4:13].  And very recently, maybe the beginning of--the end of the--
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: I used to say a lot, "Don't petition--give yourself permission; you are the answer to your prayers."
Story_ID: 654656
Speaker 1: Let's begin by talking about your family, and I think we'll, we'll begin with your mother's side of the family.  Tell me your mother's name, when and where she was born, if you know.
Speaker 2: My mother was born Bernice May Childs [Bernice Childs Johnson], and she was born in Dawson, Georgia, Terrell County, the same place as my birth.
Speaker 1: What year?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: She was born 1922, December the 25th.
Speaker 1: And, and tell me where Dawson is in relation to Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Well, first, Dawson is twenty-six miles west of Albany [Georgia], fifty-two miles south of Columbus, Georgia, and I would just imagine that from Atlanta--and I'm guessing that it's at least a hundred and--maybe sixty-two miles.
Speaker 1: Okay, so we're talking south Georgia.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did your mother share any stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: It was a time of brutal segregation, and there were few jobs, she used to tell me, for Negroes, and that was one of the reasons that she went north, even after I was born, leaving me with my grandmother [Carter's maternal grandmother, Willie Mae Roberts Mullins], to seek employment.  Most of the women in the community did day work in the homes of whites, ironing clothes, cleaning house.  It was a pretty cruel time because it was during the Depression [Great Depression].  And stories--I can't recall stories that my grandmother or my mother would have told.
Speaker 1: Do you know about her education?
Speaker 2: My mother's formal education went to the eleventh grade, and she took classes in Columbus, Ohio after that, but she never received a high school diploma.
Speaker 1: Do you know what year it was that she left to go north?  Or how old were you when she went north?
Speaker 2: I think I may have been two or three; I think it was closer probably to two.  I cannot remember my mother being with me in Georgia raising me; I can remember my grandmother, and I can remember my mother returning at Christmastime with many gifts, coming back to see me, and I have very fond memories of those--anticipation of those visits.
Story_ID: 654657
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your [maternal] grandmother; and then when we get to your childhood, we can then share those stories.
Speaker 2: Okay, I'll fill out a little more.
Speaker 1: Tell me your grandmother's name, and about your grandmother.
Speaker 2: Willie Mae Mullins [Willie Mae Roberts Mullins].  My grandmother was married about three times [sic.].  She was Roberts, she was Childs, and Mullins.  My grandmother was a very strong church woman; in fact, she was president of the missionary society at the Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church [First Shiloh Baptist Church, Dawson, Georgia], and had been for many years.  My grandmother cast the longest shadow in my life, my--this is my maternal grandmother, because while we were watching Alex Haley's 'Roots' at our home in Columbus, Ohio--and this was after I had finished college [Virginia Seminary and College; Virginia University of Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia], after I had graduated from seminary at Boston University [Boston University School of Theology, Boston, Massachusetts], after I had gotten married [to Marva Griffin Carter] and I was ordained.  We were watching 'Roots' and a commercial came on, and just in the family conversation about our roots, my mother [Bernice Childs Johnson], without any solicitation, informed me that when I was one week old, that my grandmother took me in her arms and stood before the congregation at the Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Dawson, Georgia and prayed out loud for God to make me a preacher.  No one ever told me that until after I was ordained, and it fell on me like a ton of bricks because it's probably the most powerful thing I have ever heard regarding the potency of prayer.  Because I really believe that I had been called to the ministry, but I thought it was primarily something between myself and my connection to God.  And to entertain the idea that my grandmother had first put this request out in the universe, every time I think about it, it shakes me.  And after they pronounced me Dr. Carter [HistoryMaker Lawrence Carter] at Boston University, after I had finished the defense of my dissertation, when I left the room at 745 Commonwealth Avenue, every step I took was to my grandmother's grave, and when I got there, I knelt down and thanked her, and then I spent a good part of the afternoon cleaning the entire family gravesite in Dawson.
Story_ID: 654658
Speaker 1: Tell me more about your relationship with your [maternal] grandmother as you were growing up, 'cause how long did you stay with her before you actually moved up north with your mother [Bernice Childs Johnson]?
Speaker 2: It was five years.  I was born in 1941, my grandmother passed in 1945, and that was when my aunt, Auntie Kate Mays [Eddie Childs Mays], came and, of course, to the funeral, and stayed after my grandmother's burial, and prepared to take me to Columbus, Ohio.  My grandmother was a very dignified--a very queenly lady.  And I'll show you a picture, in a moment, of her.  And I can remember several things--one of them is a little disturbing.  I was a kid full of energy, and I remember my grandmother complaining to my mother that she could not keep up with me and that I would do things that embarrassed her, like one Saturday--every Saturday we went to Main Street, the only street downtown that was paved, except maybe one or two others in the white community, and she'd go to pay bills and to shop.  Our first stop was always at Joe Moore's undertaker [Moore's Funeral Home; Johnson and Son Funeral Service, Dawson, Georgia] because we got the news from him [Joseph Moore] what was going on around town.  He was the first black in Dawson [Georgia] to have a telephone, and my grandmother would always--we'd always go in to view who was in there, and that was the way she knew who had passed, and we never went downtown without going to the undertaker and stopping to talk to the mortician on the sidewalk, and he knew a great deal.  But on one particular Saturday, my grandmother went into a furniture store to pay a bill, and as I walked in behind her, always following her, I saw this nice little rocking chair that was designed for a child, and I just sat right down in it and started rocking, and she turned around and saw me and she said, "You stay right there until I come back."  So she went and paid the bill and then she walked by me and said, "Okay, we're ready to go."  And she walked on out the door assuming that I would trail her--well, I didn't; I continued to rock in that chair.  Well, she soon discovered that I was not following her and she came back and found me in that chair and she said, "I told you to come on."  And I said, "Ma Dear, I want this chair."  I called her Ma Dear.  And she said, "I cannot afford that chair."  And I said, "But I like this chair, Ma Dear," and I'm just rocking--I don't know whether I was three or four.  And the white owner of the store said, "Oh, Willie Mae [Willie Mae Roberts Mullins], why don't you buy that chair for that boy; he clearly likes it."  And my grandmother, I think, was furious with me (laughter) and she bought the chair.  And I imagine she did so because the white store owner had suggested that she do so so strongly.  Looking back on that, I don't know; the relationship between blacks and whites was not normal, as you can imagine.  Well, my grandmother got the chair for me, but she told my mother about it and that it strained her, and my mother bought a child's harness for me with a leash so that I could be controlled better when she went downtown.  I'll never forget that--walking around with that.  I don't know where that leash is today (laughter), but I think of that sometimes when I think of how we put leashes on animals (laughter), particularly our pet dogs (laughter).  Since then, I've seen that on a few children, but I sometimes feel horrible that I caused my grandmother a little anguish in that regard (laughter).
Story_ID: 654659
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But another thing that I remember that is really historic--we lived--from Main Street, maybe was one, two, three, four, five houses.  Now, I'm saying houses rather than blocks, but they were actually blocks also--five houses by telephone from getting news of what had happened in town because when the messages came to the undertaker [Joseph Moore], there were few blacks that had phones.  He would call the closest house to our home that had a phone, and that person would come out on the back porch and yell across a field to the next family, and pass the news, and that family member would go out to the front yard and yell across the street, and they'd go out to their backyard and carr- and that's how we would get news.  But I remember a day that's just so faint in my mind; it's a strange thing because I was born September 23rd, 1941, and Pearl Harbor, I think, was December 1st, 1941.
Speaker 2: Seventh.
Speaker 1: December 7th?  You may be correct.  I know it was December.  So, you see, I'm just a--I'm just a child in arms, but I remember.  And this may very well be my earliest memory.  Somebody had to have been carrying me.  And after we left the downtown area walking--somebody was carrying me--we got about a hundred yards from the undertaker [Moore's Funeral Home; Johnson and Son Funeral Service, Dawson, Georgia] going into the black community, and it was evening.  And the family that had a phone came out on the porch and said, "Willie Mae [Carter's maternal grandmother, Willie Mae Roberts Mullins], come up on the porch; we have some news for you."  And my grandmother, with packages in her arm, went up on the porch, and they told her that her son had been killed at Pearl Harbor [Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Hawaii], and she started crying--I can feel it.  And she just went to pieces.  That, I believe, is my earliest memory, and I was only, what?  How many months?
Speaker 2: Four months old.
Speaker 1: Four months old.  I can feel that--my grandmother crying.
Speaker 2: Wow, that's powerful.
Speaker 1: And that was the first time I knew.  And it's fascinating that it was a war [World War II, WWII], and the loss of her son that made her weep because war that caused my father [John Carter III], who was drafted, to be shell shocked in the [U.S.] military.  One evening my father was standing watch, and--with his best friend--
Speaker 2: Let's, let's finish talking about your mother's [Bernice Childs Johnson] side of the family--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and then we'll go to your father's side, just so that we, we keep the dates in, in the order chronological, okay?  So you were with your grandmother for five years--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and you kind of described the neighborhood.  You didn't actually get a chance to go to school until you went north, is that correct?
Speaker 1: That's correct.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Well, I just--she took me to church [at First Shiloh Baptist Church, Dawson, Georgia] constantly, and I remember us walking through the community a lot and visiting neighbors, and my getting hungry and saying, "Come on, Ma Dear, I'm hungry; let's go home, I'm ready to eat."
Story_ID: 654660
Speaker 1: Because you--one of my questions was going to be what was your earliest childhood memory.  But at this point, think about the sound--a sound, a sight or a smell that would take you back to that time.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, that's easy.  I think it would have to be a smell of vanilla because the custard pies, and also the Brunwich [sic. Brunswick] stew, made from the ears of the hog, and other parts.  They used to dig pits in the ground and they used to put fence over them, and they'd put the cleaned, split hog on the fence and put another fence on top of the hog, and over these coals they would use a big branch or a broom to put the barbeque sauce on it, and they'd turn the double fence over in order to--I remember that smell.  And the Brunwich stew, it went with the cooking of the barbeque.  But the blackberry cobbler was another smell, and the pecans--the many pecan trees; but the vanilla, the egg custards--there's a story about this.  My adopted aunt, Corine Harris--we called her Auntie Dot.  Auntie Dot cooked the best egg custards, and I remember asking her when I visited her much later--about 1950--to give me the recipe.  She would not, and I didn't understand.  She said, "I'm not gonna give it to you because if I give it to you, you will forget me, but if I take it with me to the grave, you will never forget me."  And so for years, I wanted to have that experience of tasting those egg custards, and it wasn't until a plane broke down and could not arrive on the island of Dominica--an island close to northern South America, and they had to send another plane to get me a few years ago, that required us to detour and land in St. Lucia, and my host who was chaperoning me said, "I've been here before and I'm gonna take you to a restaurant close to the airport."  And I ordered creme brulee for the dessert.  And when I tasted it, I jumped up and brought the entire restaurant to a halt when I screamed, "I found it!  I found it!"  Because it was the taste of vanilla (laughter) of my aunt's egg custard pies, of the recipe she had taken to the grave (laughter).  And so I theorized that my ancestors either came up from the Caribbean, or that that recipe that was, was an African recipe that had been brought over, and in the separation, it was passed along in different families.
Story_ID: 654661
Speaker 1: You talked about your, your [maternal] grandmother [Willie Mae Roberts Mullins] and, and religion and, and going to church.  I'm sure there's a story about--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --you at church with your grandmother.  What do you remember (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I will tell you one--one that has influenced my ministry here powerfully.  And maybe--I didn't bring it out here but I'll take you in there and show you the pictures.  Probably my first job in this world was one that I can never forget.  Either a little boy of three or four, I was permitted to ring the church bell high in the tower, and that required me--'cause I was just the right size--put my foot in a rope that had a loop on it, and to ride the bell (laughter) up and down, as my weight was just enough to cause the swinging and the movement of the bell hammer.  And there's nothing that I enjoyed more than going to church, to ring the bell that I knew would summon the people--that it was time for church (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of the--you told me Shiloh (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church [First Shiloh Baptist Church, Dawson, Georgia]--
Speaker 1: Baptist, okay.
Speaker 2: --and that church is still standing.
Story_ID: 654662
Speaker 1: Now you said your--did your mother [Bernice Childs Johnson] have siblings bes- you said one aunt--you just talked about one aunt.
Speaker 2: My mother had--yes, she had, she had three brothers--Nathanial [sic. Jathaniel Childs], Curtis [Curtis Childs] and Joe [Joe Mullins], and she had one sister, Auntie Kate Mays [Eddie Childs Mays].  My mother and my aunt raised me because my father [John Carter III] was--because of being shell shocked in the [U.S.] military--posttraumatic syndrome--was in and out of the Chillicothe's Veterans Hospital [Chillicothe Veterans Hospital; Chillicothe Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Chillicothe, Ohio], and I could only remember him living with us for one--about one month, and I can remember visiting him in the hospital.  So, you see, war, once again, robbed me of my, of my father, and is the first memory that I have of pain--that something was wrong.  And so that has followed me into my professional career, and my big emphasis here is that my work is a peace ministry, and it emanates from my hatred of war.
Speaker 1: You spoke of your [maternal] grandmother [Willie Mae Roberts Mullins] being married three times.  Who was the grandfather that you knew?
Speaker 2: Well, it's interesting.  The grandfather that I knew was my father's father [John Carter, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay, so on your mother's side you didn't know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) On my mother's side, I did not meet but one of those--Mr. Childs, but I did not meet him until I was nine, and that was in 1950.
Speaker 1: And that's actually--and that's actually your mother's father.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And what I learned was--that was my mother's stepfather; my mother's real father's name was Emmett Warren, but for some reason, she took the name of Childs because I believe that my grandmother never married Emmett Warren but was married to these other three.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think I've gotten my facts just a little wrong here.  Roberts was my grandmother's maiden name, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was, it was Childs and Mullins--so two husbands, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And marriage, of course, you know in those days, was just a matter of jumping a broom (laughter); that was all.
Speaker 1: Now, what about any great-grandparents?  Any--do you have any names?
Speaker 2: Yes, one, but that's on my father's side.
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll go there in, in just a second (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 654663
Speaker 1: We talked about your father a little bit.  Tell me again his name and where and when he was born.
Speaker 2: Well, my father's name was John Henry Carter III [John Carter III], and as far as I know, he was also born in Dawson, Georgia in Terrell County.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know what year?
Speaker 2: No, I do not.  I could probably find that out through the [U.S.] military, but that is research that I have not yet done.
Speaker 1: What can you tell me about your father and his, his family?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My mother [Bernice Childs Johnson] used to tell me that my father was a very smart man--very intelligent.  He came from a family of railroad men and preachers, and she expected that he was going to be a minister, and being shell shocked in the military ended that.  My father's father was a minister, John Henry Carter, Jr. [John Carter, Jr.], and I have very strong memories of him passing our house to go to church.  He was short, as was my father, and I remember him--I don't think I ever saw him when he did not have on a three piece suit with a gold chain.  And he was highly respected in the community, and I remember they told me that he always pastored very small churches.  My image that I have of him was that he was bald, and was not corpulent, but seemed to have a nice (laughter) chest, or stomach, and used to wear old preacher shoes--those black high top shoes, and used to walk very slowly with a little rock, from one side to the other.  This is my first image of my grandfather, and I could see him passing our house.  I remember that he had a daughter, and she lived a--quite a while; I don't know if she's still living today, but was the last relative that I think we had on my father's side in Dawson, Georgia. I have a vague memory of when my grandfather's wife--my father's mother passed, but I don't remember the year, and I can remember just vague conversation about it around the house.
Speaker 1: What was his wife's name?  What was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: I'm sure I've written that down somewhere but I cannot--I remember I, I probably went to the home several times, I can just vaguely remember, to eat, and I can see myself sort of running around in the yard.  It--it's quite something; most of those memories have passed.  I'm so sorry (laughter).
Speaker 1: It's--that's fine.  So, do you have any names of great-grandparents on your father's side?
Speaker 2: Just John Henry Carter, Sr. [John Carter, Sr.], and he was a preacher.
Speaker 1: Was there any talk about either side of your family being in slavery?
Speaker 2: I think there was, but John Henry Carter--John Henry Carter, Sr. may have been a slave in his childhood, but I think that was about all that was ever said to me.  I have no--I know that he, he may be the one, but somebody lived to be 114 years old.  I remember when I first heard that, I used to just shout around the house and say, "I got a chance!  I got a chance!" (Laughter) But he may have been the most--the longest lived in the family.
Story_ID: 654664
Speaker 1: Do you know whether either, on your mother [Bernice Childs Johnson] and father's [John Carter III] side, that--whether they owned the land that they lived on, or whether they rented?
Speaker 2: I really don't know the answer to that, but as I reflect on it, I get the impression that we owned the property.  I think our address was 614 Walnut Street [Dawson, Georgia], and I, I think that house stayed in our family for years, and I think it was only in my teenage years that we sold that house, but it was a house on brick stilts.  And I can remember the day.
Speaker 1: You can remember the day that you sold the house?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Oh well, I think, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was a teenager in Columbus [Ohio].
Speaker 1: But you said you remember the day; what day is that?
Speaker 2: Yes--no, I was about to tell you something else.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry; go ahead (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I remember the day when electricity was installed in the house, and this was around 1944, and I remember my--going around there looking at that meter with that thing going around in it and my grandmother [Carter's maternal grandmother, Willie Mae Roberts Mullins] saying, saying very strongly to me that I was not to touch that by any means.  And then my uncle came and reinforced it.  We had kerosene lamps throughout the house.  And another memory I have was the day I discovered the airplane.  I was walking in front of our house in the middle of the street, barefooted on the dirt road, and I heard this sound up in the sky and I looked up, and this plane appeared to be writing in the sky, and I started yelling, "Ma Dear!  Ma Dear!  Come out here!  There's writing in the sky!  There's writing in the sky!"  And when I dropped my head, my uncle Nena Mullins, was coming down the middle of the--Walnut Street, and he said, "Young'un!  Go in there and tell your grandmother to come out here; tell her they're writing in the sky that Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] is dead."  That was how I discovered there was a president, so 1945.  Another thing I recall that happened like on a Saturday, I walked outta the house and saw three white men walking down the middle of the street--middle of the road--with rifles, and it frightened me and I ran inside and got my grandmother, and she came and looked, and she said to me, "Go under the house and get Benny [ph.]; they're killing dogs that don't have license tags around their necks."  And I got under the house and held him so he would not bark, and I saw these men from the middle of the road aiming their rifles and killing dogs on the private property of homes.  This is in the black community, and I don't believe this was happening in the white community.  I also remember when I discovered that there were colleges.  My grandmother had some renters, and they were two girls; they were college students who were going to Albany State [Albany State College; Albany State University, Albany, Georgia], and they came and lived in our house and they paid rent, and that was when I first discovered and heard people say in my house, "You're going to college, too."  And these girls used to--they were very fond of me; they used to talk to me about college, and that probably was where the ideas were first planted that I would not only go, but I'd one day work in a college (laughter).
Story_ID: 654665
Speaker 1: Now, you talked a little bit about your house [in Dawson, Georgia], but if you would just take a minute and describe your, your home.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yes.  It was a wooden frame house, a one story that sat on brick stilts; it had a front porch and a back porch, only the back porch was on the side of the house.  It had no running water, and it had an outhouse, no inside plumbing.  I remember that during the day, you could look up to the roof--it was a tin roof, and you could see the holes in the tin, and I remember during the day, you could--some points in the floor, in different rooms, you could see the ground.  In other words, the boards were very worn, and I do remember that there were--it was one, two, three--I remember three rooms and a hallway--and a wide hallway.  I remember that one room had a fireplace, and this was also one of my early jobs, and when my grandmother [Carter's maternal grandmother, Willie Mae Roberts Mullins] ironed clothes, I used to sit between the ironing board, behind which my grandmother stood, and the fireplace, and my job was to receive the coal irons from her and put them next to the fire, and to hand her the hot irons so she could iron the clothes because there was no electricity at that time.  And I remember as I sat there between the fire and the ironing board, we would talk.  And it's amazing to me because, you see, this was between 1941 and 1945 so I was--had to be just three or four years old, or five.
Story_ID: 654666
Speaker 1: Perhaps the most powerful memory was on the night my uncle Mud, as I called him--he was the oldest child of Mr. Mullins from a previous marriage.  Uncle Mud came and got me.  It was now night, and he picked me up and he said, "I'm taking you across the hall so that you can say goodbye to your Ma Dear [Carter's maternal grandmother, Willie Mae Roberts Mullins]."  He said, "She's going to pass."  And I remember, in silence, as he held me and we crossed the hall (pause), worrying and trying to make sense out of where she's--where's she going?  And when we got to her bed, she was under a white sheet and the room was very dimly lit, and we stood there as he held me.  I am so grateful for this moment.  And she looked up at me and her last words to me were, "I want you to be a good boy; be a good boy."  And right there in front of my eyes, I saw my uncle move the sheet and covered her head.  So I was the last one she spoke to.  There is a sense in which my grandmother has never died.  And as much influence as my mother [Bernice Childs Johnson] and my aunt [Eddie Childs Mays] had on me, in a very real way, my grandmother has been right with me everywhere I have been.  So, it's amazing how powerful an early five year experience can be.  And as you can see, this is a very emotional time for me because I love her as dearly as I love anybody.  I don't know, but she was a very kind lady.
Story_ID: 654667
Speaker 1: Now, how soon was it after your [maternal] grandmother [Willie Mae Roberts Mullins] passed away that you were then taken to, to the north?
Speaker 2: Well, my aunt stayed a--maybe a month, sort of straightening up things and preparing me to go, and I did not want to leave.  And I knew that I delayed the trip because when finally we boarded the train to start toward Columbus [Ohio], I became violently ill on the train, and the conductor said to my aunt, Eddie Mays [Eddie Childs Mays], "You're going to have to get off this train in Atlanta [Georgia] because this boy is too sick to go across the Mason Dixon Line."  And so, against her wishes, she got off the train with me in Atlanta in 1945, and she took me to the home of Queen Esther out here off of Simpson Road in Atlanta, and back in those days, that was country--you were in the country.  And they had acres of corn; I guess you could say they had a small farm.  And we lived with this cousin--Queen Esther Goar [Queen Goar] was her name--was the daughter of my grandmother's sister--my maternal grandmother's sister--Willie Mae Mullins' sister.  And for a month, a solid month, we stayed in Atlanta until I got well.  And I remember playing hide and go seek with her daughter Cookie [ph.], running through the cornfields and climbing pecan trees and eating raw pecans and getting the worse stomach ache I've ever had in my life; I thought I was gonna die.  And you know what they did to get me well?  They gave me my first enema.  And I don't know if you know what a hot water enema is, where they put the hot water up in a rubber bottle, and put this tube up your buttocks, and that hot water rushes down into your body, and then they put you on a slop jar and you completely empty?  That was the most painful and almost traumatic experience, but it cured me instantly 'cause it washed all those raw pecans out of me (laughter).  Well, I think about that a great deal because we only buried Queen Esther about a year ago, and her daughter is very close to us and I have just finished--I performed the wedding.  I, I, I--a renewal of vows of her granddaughter recently, and I performed the wedding.
Speaker 1: Did they ever find out what was making you ill, that caused you to get off the train?
Speaker 2: Well, to be honest with you, I think it was psychosomatic.  I did not want to leave Georgia.
Story_ID: 654668
Speaker 1: And that gives me a chance to tell you another story.  Probably when I was four, my grandmother [Carter's maternal grandmother, Willie Mae Roberts Mullins] and I--it must have been the winter--went to Columbus, Ohio to visit my mother [Bernice Childs Johnson], and I believe that was my first train ride.  And I don't know if you're old enough to remember, but any trains coming from the South going to the North had to usually go through Cincinnati [Ohio], and Cincinnati had the most spectacular train station, I believe, in the nation.  And we had to change trains in Cincinnati, and there was this long flight of stairs you had to climb.  And you gotta remember now, those locomotives with those powerful wheels, with all that noise and smoke--it's enough to scare you to death.  That was my introduction to American industry, and I had never seen anything like that Cincinnati train station [Union Terminal], which was a far cry from the one little train stop in Dawson [Georgia].  And climbing all those stairs was opening up my world in a way that I don't know that any other kind of exposure could have done it to how great the achievement of our nation was.  But when we got to the top of those stairs, and got into that vaulted, Romanesque, arched terminal with those massive sand paintings, I just knew I had arrived someplace that I'd visit a hundred times more.  But do you know that the authorities in the City of Cincinnati dismantled that train station?  And in my belief, and in the belief of many citizens of Ohio, that was one of the seven wonders of the United States.  The building still stands; they took those paintings out of there--those sand paintings, and they don't use that station anymore because I'd be encouraging everybody who watches this video to go see it.  I'm told that they put some of those removed sand paintings in the Cincinnati airport [Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, Hebron, Kentucky], but I've been through there several times and I've never seen them.  And so we went on to Columbus, Ohio 103 miles away, and we got there it was night.  And my mother and aunt [Eddie Childs Mays] were living in a--what they called a four room cold water flat with a basement, and I ran from the front window on the second floor to the back window, and they told me many times--I kept saying, "Ma Dear, let's go home; this house don't have no porch."  "Ma Dear, let's go home; there's no back porch, there's no front porch."  "Ma Dear, I don't like this place."  To put me to bed, they had to give me whipping.  And the next day, they tell me that all I did was sit on the steps of the house and beat some pot lids together and sing church songs to myself (laughter).  That's how I entertained myself.  And they talked among themselves, but they never told me, "This boy is going to be a minister;" though I think they thought it, they never said a word to me.  I just eventually preached on (laughter).
Speaker 2: So, at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, you see, I didn't want to go to Columbus when my grandmother died because my memory was no yard, back or front; and no porch.  "I wanna stay in Georgia."
Story_ID: 654669
Speaker 1: So, after this month, staying with Queen Esther [Queen Goar]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm (laughter).
Speaker 1: --you eventually had to go.
Speaker 2: Had to go, and it evidently was enough of a transition that I went, and it was the best thing that could have happened to me (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, tell me why do you think this was the best thing for you at this point?
Speaker 2: Because my mother [Bernice Childs Johnson] truly loved me, and she tried her best to provide the very finest that working three and four jobs could provide.  She gave me so many wonderful experiences from adventures in eating, to buying a car, and driving us around to visit, exploring--taking me to the zoo, to the Ohio State Fair, downtown to shop.  I was one of the best dressed kids in the neighborhood.  Christmas was unbelievable, unbelieve- she gave me everything she wanted to have in her life.  And I knew it was very painful for her because she always wanted to be married, but my father [John Carter III] was, was ill--was in the hospital [Chillicothe Veterans Hospital; Chillicothe Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Chillicothe, Ohio].  And so the two of them struggled to give me the best they had, and they trusted the school system--the elementary school system; they took me to--I went to a private kindergarten.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school?
Speaker 2: And the elementary school was Garfield Elementary [Garfield Elementary School, Columbus, Ohio] on Mount Vernon [Avenue].  Garfield--the building itself dated back to the 1800s.  I loved school.  The principal, Mr. Charles Blackburn [Charles P. Blackburn], he looked like he had some Indian [Native American] features--a very distinguished looking man, became a first hero.  I can actually remember sitting in the first grade looking out the window contemplating college; that I wanted to go all the way, as far as you could go.  And because Columbus [Ohio] was the home of Ohio State University--The Ohio State University--we were always hearing about it in the news, and everything that happened with its great football team.  And I just always knew that I would go to college.  But in the first grade, I developed a series of illnesses--whooping cough, mumps, measles, needing my tonsils out.  These illnesses hit almost one right after the other, and when I had the whooping cough, I remember the doctor coming to the house, and I can see my aunt [Eddie Childs Mays] looking at me in the bed and wondering if I was going to live.  But I remember one unusual prescription the doctor gave me which surprised me as a kid.  He told my aunt to give me, ever so often, a big tablespoon of whiskey (laughter).  Well, it must've worked because I got strong enough, but I almost missed half of the first grade. I went back to school, and I did not realize, until the fifth grade, but my mother and aunt realized it, I wasn't getting the education, I wasn't learning how to read.  And my aunt used to read to me the newspaper, and one day she refused to.  She said, "I don't understand; you're supposed to be able to read by now."  I did not learn to read in the first five grades of school, and--I don't know if I'm moving too quickly, but the emphasis in this school was on recess and art.  And I remember when it came time for spelling, I used to look around the room and write down words on the walls that I would see, rather than the words that I was supposed to be spelling.  So they were correctly spelled, they just weren't the words requested.  And I remember the Weekly Reader when it came out; this is 19--late 1940s, and that was the first interest that I had in national and international issues; the Weekly Reader introduced me to them. But there was a challenge because I couldn't read.
Story_ID: 654670
Speaker 1: --Strange because the whole community had predicted that I was gonna be one of the smartest kids in this school--the whole community, before I went to school, 'cause I had all the signs of it but it, in my opinion, was the wrong school.
Speaker 2: Well, tell me about the school.  You told me who the principal was [Charles P. Blackburn], and--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --the teachers.  Were your teachers black or white, and who were the other students (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All the teachers were black.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They were--and I, I think some of them are graduates of Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].  They were--and they were all women, all the teachers at this--at Garfield [Garfield Elementary School, Columbus, Ohio]; I didn't have any male teacher there.  And you said who were some of them?  I remember the name.  A Rutledge [ph.]--oh, boy.  Mrs. Hughes [ph.]; there was one who was--I just can't call her name, and I'm sure she will be delighted that I can't because she was a beautiful woman, but she--when we moved from that community across town--what is known as the Hilltop [Columbus, Ohio], I was supposed to pass to the sixth grade; she did not--she put on the--my card, place in fifth grade.  So I did the fifth grade twice because she knew that I was not ready.
Speaker 2: So, when you, when you moved--changed neighborhoods and moved, were you able to get help to help you learn to read at that point?
Speaker 1: Josephine Clark [ph.], white teacher, called on me in the fifth grade--called on everyone in the class; maybe there were twenty-five to thirty kids in this class, most of them white; there were other blacks in the class.  And I--and everybody read well, and then it came my turn, and I started missing words and the kids started snickering, and I started laughing with them--that was how I dealt with it.  And I didn't do well, and so Mrs. Clark said to me, "I want to see you after class."  So, when all the kids left, I went up to her desk and she said, "Would you like to learn how to read?"  And I flashed a big grin on my face--I'll never forget it.  And I said, "Yes."  And she said, "I will teach you how to read," she said, "but you'll have to stay after school."  I said, "I will."  Now, let me interrupt myself to tell you this.  This is one reason I could never hate white people because in my house my aunt, Eddie Kate Mays [Carter's maternal aunt, Eddie Childs Mays], had a little red bookcase filled with books.  And as a kid, from the very beginning I used to pull those down, after I got in Columbus [Ohio], from 1945--take the books down and look through the books and look at the pictures.  And I can remember sort of crying inside, wondering what secrets were locked in those words, and all I could do was look at the pictures.  And when Josephine Clark said, "I'll teach you to read," she was handing me the golden key that would help me to unlock the secrets of those words so that I would be exposed to the wisdom of the ages.
Story_ID: 654671
Speaker 1: And it was in the sixth grade I had my first science project with Mr. Charles Cook [ph.], a white man, my first male teacher, and he judged my science project to be the most impressive of all the students.  I'll tell you about that in just a minute.  Well, I'll tell you now.  The--I had gotten a movie projector for Christmas, reel to reel, and somehow the idea got in my mind somewhere that black was the fullness of color, and white was the absence of color, and I set out to prove it.  And so I brought my little projector to school [Garfield Elementary School, Columbus, Ohio] and I took the--one of the reels off that held the film--the empty spool that was supposed to collect the film, and I took construction paper and I drew a circle around the wheel and cut out four quarters, four different colors, and I pasted those different color quarters on the wheel--scotch taped them on, so you had four colors, and then I put them on the machine, plugged it in and turned it on, and when the wheel went around, all the colors turned to gray.  And I said to the class, "You see?  Blackness is the fullness of color, and white is the absence of color--end of my experiment" (laughter).  And the teacher, I can see him today, said, "That's very impressive, Lawrence [HistoryMaker Lawrence Carter]," and said to the class, "That's good science" (laughter).  And then we had to change classes for English--composition--and Mrs. Teeter [ph.] asked the class, "Who can tell me what the word exclamatory means?"  No one knew, and she couldn't believe it.  So, for ten minutes she just--, "Somebody knows."  In the back of the room I raised my hand and I got the answer correct.  When we changed classes, four teachers were standing in the middle of the hall, and when I went by, she said, "Lawrence is the only one in the class who knew what exclamatory meant," and all the kids heard it and the teachers came to me, one at a time, to congratulate me--all--three white women and one white man, and all the kids were complimenting me in my class.  That was the beginning of my love of language, and words, and reading, and speeches (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's great. Before we go on and talk more about school--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --because you're in the sixth grade--
Speaker 1: I--there's one other thing I remember about my first speech in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What grade were you in?
Speaker 1: --for Easter, and I think I had to have been no more than first or second grade.  And the speech simply was--and, and this--no, no, this, this was back in, in Georgia at Shiloh [First Shiloh Baptist Church, Dawson, Georgia], so I wasn't in school yet.  It was Easter; I had to memorize this.  "I don't know what you're looking at me so hard for, I didn't come to stay; I just came to let you know today is Easter Day" (laughter).  I can--my grandmother [Carter's maternal grandmother, Willie Mae Roberts Mullins] was so proud of me, and they were so nervous that I was not gonna get this right (laughter).  That was my first speech (laughter).  I just wanted to get that in.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Tell me--before we go on, because sixth grade--do you go to a middle school?
Speaker 1: I went to junior high school [West Junior and Senior High School; West High School, Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Junior high school.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 654672
Speaker 1: But before we go to junior high school [West Junior and Senior High School; West High School, Columbus, Ohio] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --I want you to tell me more about the neighborhood.  You moved to Hilltop [Columbus, Ohio]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and I wanna know about that neighborhood--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and a little more about the type of work.  You said your mother [Bernice Childs Johnson] had three jobs and your aunt [Eddie Childs Mays] worked also.  A little bit about her work, and the neighborhood in which you lived.
Speaker 2: Well, when we moved from the East Side of Columbus [Ohio], which was entering what was popularly known in the country at that time as urban renewal, which really was urban removal.  They sold our cold water flat, and I remember that my mother and aunt lost five hundred dollars that they put down on a house in the--on the East Side that they didn't get because they decided that it was not gonna be a good place to raise me; it had no front yard, front door came right out to the sidewalk at a busy intersection, like Mount Vernon [Avenue] and Hamilton [Avenue] in Columbus.  So they found a house on the other side of town, what was called the Hilltop.  It was a residential community where the homes had front lawns, and this was different from where we had lived; it meant I would have to cut the grass.  And there was backyard, and there were flower beds along the side of the house, and I was so thrilled.  We had a screened in porch, it was a white framed house, and this was a community where people were very education conscious, and the pastor had degrees, and it was a predominantly white community with a couple of streets that had sprinklings of blacks, and it was much more middle class, and it was not crime saturated like the East Side had been because there were shootings, and there was the numbers racket, and there were drunks staggering, and there were sirens.  I never thought of it as the ghetto--it was home.  But, I guess, looking back, some people might have characterized it as that.  But urban renewal wiped it all out; they tore all the houses down.  I go back there today, there's nothing.  Well, they even cut the main street so that--it used to be a thriving black business street, Mount Vernon; it isn't anymore.  But now, in the new community I was located in, on the Hilltop, the main street that our home was just three houses from, was Broad Street, Route 40 [U.S. Route 40], which spanned the entire nation from Atlantic City [New Jersey] to San Francisco [California]; it was the old trail west, and it was the highway that Lincoln's [President Abraham Lincoln] body was taken from Washington [D.C.] to Springfield, Illinois.  So anytime of the day, I could walk out on Broad Street, and I could literally see cars from all over the world, not just the nation, but cars that had been put on boats with license plates from other countries.  And that was the street that I used to walk to school on from the fifth grade to the sixth, going to Highland [Highland Elementary School, Columbus, Ohio], and then after a bad experience in the seventh grade walking through the community to what we called junior high then; they call it middle school now.  The seventh, eighth, and ninth grades were called junior high.  I used to--for the seventh grade--used to walk through the community with the kids in the community, but I stopped very abruptly one day walking with them because I got tired of arguments, fights, people slapping you upside the head because back in those days, the boys--black boys--used to get their hair shaved very closely around the sides, and one of the humiliating things was the older kids would slap you upside the head and then nobody--you turn around and everybody would be pretending like, "I didn't do it."  So rather than deal with that, in the eighth grade I made a decision to walk to school down Broad Street to Powell Avenue, where the high school was, until the twelfth grade--alone.  That is how I got control of my life.  I took seriously the scripture, "Come out from among them" [2 Corinthians 6:17].  And little did I know, it set a trend for the rest of my life that he who would see the great wonders of the world must often be ready to travel alone.
Story_ID: 654673
Speaker 1: Tell me more about the difference in the neighborhood where--you said you lived on one side of town before you moved to Hilltop [Columbus, Ohio] which is predominantly white.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Who were the store owners that were--all--were, were there black store owners on that side of town?
Speaker 2: There were black barbershops.  The store owners on the Hilltop were white; it was a laundromat and cleaners--it was a black, a black cleaners--maybe two.  On the Hilltop, Wayne [Avenue]--these were streets--Oakley [Avenue], Wheatland [Avenue], Highland [Avenue], and Clarendon [Avenue]; those were the most heavily populated black streets.  Other streets around--Belvidere [Avenue], and so forth, were solidly white.  The blacks were between Sullivant [Avenue] and Broad Street, but on the other side of Sullivant and the other side of Broad Street was solid white.  And there were whites on the streets that I named where the blacks lived, but they were gradually moving.  Even the radio teacher for the high school, Mrs. Hall [Evelyn Hall], lived on my street, but she eventually sold the house.  My experience with her at West Junior High School [West Junior and Senior High School; West High School, Columbus, Ohio], was that she couldn't make up her mind.  She liked my voice, but she eventually did not vote for me to be a member of the high school radio announcers--made the announcements every morning to the student body.
Speaker 1: All right.  In the neighborhood that you moved from, can you tell me whether your friends there, whether they lived in one or two parent households?
Speaker 2: In which community?
Speaker 1: In the first community.  Was that on the South Side of, of Columbus [Ohio] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The East Side.
Speaker 1: The East Side.
Speaker 2: Where they lived in one or two--
Speaker 1: Parent homes.
Speaker 2: They lived in two parent homes.  My classmates and neighbors were in two parent homes.
Speaker 1: And at this point (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was the exception.
Story_ID: 654674
Speaker 1: And your mother [Bernice Childs Johnson] and aunt [Eddie Childs Mays]--what were their occupations at this time?
Speaker 2: My mother--my mother's first job in Columbus [Ohio] was oiling the wheels of locomotives.  We had--got some pictures of, of her at home doing this--long oil spouts; she in overalls.  It's her first job.  And though I can't give them all to you systematically, what I remember was she worked at Grant Hospital [OhioHealth Grant Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio], she worked at North Hospital [Doctors Hospital North; OhioHealth Rehabilitation Hospital, Columbus, Ohio], but the longest job I remember she had was at the Lazarus department store in their dining room, and she was in charge of the sandwich division.  And then there was a job she had when I was--this is getting ahead--when I was--had gone away to college [Virginia Theological Seminary and College; Virginia University of Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia], I came home one--Christmas like, and my mother came home and was changing clothes and going out the door for another job, and my aunt said to me, "You need to go with her in order to see what she's doing to put you through college."  So I did, and I will never forget; we drove into the downtown area of Columbus, just off the downtown area, into a dark area.  It was like a fac- factory district, tall wire fences, poorly lit, and I was very turned off, and I was thinking, I don't want my mother down here in this area at night.  It didn't look safe.  And she got out of the car and opened up this gate, and then we drove in and she locked the gate and she went into this building, it was dark, and turned the lights on.  I said, "What do you do here?"  And she said, "I clean the offices and clean the floor."  And I, I was just sort of devastated that my mother was doing this, and I thought to myself, well, my mother--this just too hard, you know, and I'm just--have her do some dusting and I'll do the hard stuff.  So she got this buffer out and she plugged it in, and she proceeded to start buffing the floor, and I said, "No, no, no, I'm gonna do this."  So, I took the handles from her--it was disastrous.  I couldn't control the buffer; it threw me in every direction, and she just laughed (laughter).  I was humiliated.  There I was towering over her, and muscles, and I could not control this machine, and my mother took it from me and handed me the dust rags.  I felt that big (demonstrates).
Speaker 1: Hm.
Speaker 2: But every time I went home, she took me to Lazarus department store, took me to her friends, who were the clerks, and said, "I want this for him."  She got me everything I wanted.
Story_ID: 654675
Speaker 1: And if I may tell you this in connection?  On the day we buried my mother, I stayed in the cemetery after everybody had left, the family, to make sure that everything was like I wanted it, and one of the men who had dug the grave walked over to me and he said, "Are you related to this lady who we are about to put in the ground?"  And I said, "Yes, this is my mother."  He said, "I was looking at that tombstone, and I see it has on there, Bernice Carter Johnson [Bernice Childs Johnson]," and he says, "I'm just wondering is this the Bernice Carter who used to work at the Lazarus department store?"  And I said, "Sure is."  He said, "It is unbelievable."  He said, "I was one of her colleagues, and she had a son that she loved dearly, and she talked about him every day."  He said, "Would you be that son?"  I said, "I am he."  I lost it, I lost it.  All over town [Columbus, Ohio], as we were preparing for her funeral, this is what I heard, "Your mother never stopped talking about you."  And it was like the universe--it's like she was speaking from the grave of how proud she was of me--from one side of the city to the other as we got ready.
Story_ID: 654676
Speaker 1: Do you think that the jobs that your mother [Bernice Childs Johnson] held--well early on, you talked about one job that's just very unusual for a woman, had to do with the fact--was--do--or do you know whether this was during war time when a lot of the men were away and women took on jobs that men would normally do?
Speaker 2: Well, I really think that it didn't have so much to do with the war; I think it had more to do with discrimination, with racism, and lack of opportunity.  My mother was a very smart woman who could stretch a dollar.  My mother did more with money (laughter), with a little money, than people could do with a lot, and my mother was--used to amaze us with the detail of information that she, she knew about what was going on in town [Columbus, Ohio] (laughter), and with certain citizens.  We used to--my uncle had a nickname for her; he called her Noah--Nora [ph.] which was a take off on know it all (laughter).  I think if my mother had had a good chance at a solid education, she would have been one of the finest journalists (laughter), investigative journalists that any newspaper could have hired (laughter), because she could get the information that other people seemed not to be able to have access to.
Story_ID: 654677
Speaker 1: Let's move on now to, to high school, and tell me the name of your high school.  Or did, did you tell me--you told me the name of your junior high school.
Speaker 2: Well, it was West Junior and Senior High School [West High School, Columbus, Ohio]; both junior and senior high school were in one building.  It was quite a building; in fact, in the 1930s when it was built, there was a big sign on Broad Street at Powell Avenue that announced, "Million dollar high school two blocks away," (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So tell me about your experience in high school, and--
Speaker 2: And you realize this is my fiftieth anniversary, this past June, and I'll be going next month to celebrate my fiftieth reunion at that high school (laughter).
Speaker 1: Hm, okay.
Speaker 2: So, you want me to tell you about--
Speaker 1: About high school, about the teachers and about your, your studies, and what kind of student are you now in high school, since you had that problem with reading and seemed to have been able to overcome that.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So now you're in high school.  Tell me what type of student you are.
Speaker 2: I worked very hard, but my grades were just average, and in junior high, Mary Mock [ph.], one of my teachers--a white lady, was the most encouraging person that I recall.  She always had something positive to say, and she believed that I was going to really be somebody.  And I had some amazing experiences in, in high school--senior high school.  I was elected by the student body to be president of the science club.  This was majority high school, and I was elected to be president of the Victorious Christian Youth, the second largest club in the school.  So I was interested in science and spirituality, even in high school.  And I was a bailiff in the court; I was the one who delivered the bad news to you (laughter) that you had got a court summons, and I took the California personality exam [California Psychological Inventory], and it revealed that I scored highest on architecture, but I had a poor math background so I didn't consider that.  From the ninth grade--from the first to the ninth, I knew that I wanted to be a teacher and a principal, and I couldn't understand the people that didn't know.  But in the ninth grade, I started to get confused, and I didn't know what was happening, and from the ninth grade to the twelfth, it went from principal and teacher to social work, to ministry with--considering the law just for a minute.  And I determined that I was going to be the speaker--student speaker at my commencement from high school, and so I started early, like two years early, working on the speech and reading pieces of it to Rosa Triggs [ph.], one of my neighbors, who was a retired teacher.  And so came time for the contest; there were five of us, and the faculty voted me third place.  I was shocked, but that was it.  After I left and came back and visited a teacher, Mr. Kaylor [ph.], I asked him why I didn't get first place, and this is what he said to me.  He said, "You will remember that your twelfth grade English teacher was one of the judges, and she heard your speech.  She said it was too good for you to have written, and she voted against you.  She said the whole committee thought that your speech was the best and that you should have been the commencement speaker, but they didn't give it to you because they said, 'He can't write, so how did he write this?'"  I took it pretty well, but that is a--almost a little example of what I have lived with most of my academic career.  I never received an academic honor, but I--like for example--this may be getting a little ahead of the story--and the title of my speech, by the way, was The Hand that Rocks the Cradle Rules the World [ph.] (laughter).
Story_ID: 654678
Speaker 1: Okay.  Before, before we go on, you talked about being a bailiff.  Explain to me the bailiff of the court and the judicial--I'm, I'm not sure I understand what that is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter).  What a bailiff is.
Speaker 1: Well, I know what a bailiff is, but is this for, for school [West Junior and Senior High School; West High School, Columbus, Ohio], the school court?  Tell me how the whole system works--the judicial system of the school.
Speaker 2: I should've brought my yearbook.  I didn't bring my high school yearbook; you would have loved to have seen what they said about me--never--didn't think of it.  The student court was designed to involve the students in the disciplinary procedures, and the court had officers, it had a recorder, it had a chief justice; I don't remember if it had other justices.  I will look in my yearbook when I go home to see, and--'cause I had a--there's a picture of me in there with all the court officers, and if there was some infraction--some violation of the school policy that any student in the high school committed, if some complaint was brought against you by a faculty member or by a student, the issue was reviewed, and if it was decided by the student court that you needed to appear before them and give an explanation, or perhaps be punished, a decision was made of a date you would appear and time, and it was the bailiff's job to deliver the announcement to you during one of the school days, Monday through Friday, to get your schedule and find out where you were--class or study hall--and to deliver that to you as conveniently and as professionally as possible.  And I was chosen to be the one (laughter) to bear the bad news (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And the other thing I, I wanted just a little clarification is about the speaker for the commencement exercises.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: It, it seems that there was a written type essay contest rather than being chosen because you had the highest GPA [grade point average], which is the norm now, today. Okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's correct, yes.

Speaker 1: You're preparing to go to college; and you graduate in 1960 and, and civil rights is going on.  Tell me the landscape of, of the Civil Rights Movement in Columbus, Ohio.
Speaker 2: Well, first, I was a member of the Oakley Baptist Church [Oakley Full Gospel Baptist Church] on the Hilltop [Columbus, Ohio].  On the East Side, I was a member of the Hebrew Baptist Church [Hebrew Missionary Baptist Church, Columbus, Ohio] and attended Vacation Bible School at the Shiloh Baptist Church [Columbus, Ohio].  Shiloh is where Sandy F. Ray [Sandy Ray] had pastored, and when I was there, the pastor was James Wesley Parrish.  These were very distinguished men, and Ray was on the board of trustees here [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  In fact, there's Ray's picture right there (gesture).  And those men were, were learned; at Hebrew, the pastor was not.  But on the Hilltop, the pastor was highly educated--Jacob Julian Ashburn [Jacob Ashburn, Jr.]--and upon his death, his son [Jacob Julian Ashburn] became pastor and he had an excellent education.  But his father baptized me in 1954, but it was his son who chose me on a Sunday afternoon from our BTU group, Baptist Training Union, to participate in the Prince of Peace speaking contest, and I won that contest and went to the second level and lost against a young lady.  But this introduced me as a public speaker, and it was from this that inspired me to compete to be the commencement speaker for my 1960 high school commencement [at West Junior and Senior High School; West High School, Columbus, Ohio].  Now, on a Sunday, the president, M.C. Allen, of Virginia Seminary and College [Virginia Theological Seminary and College; Virginia University of Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia], came with a college choir to our church to speak and he came to our church because the pastor who baptized me, Jacob Ashburn, had come to be our pastor from having taught Hebrew at Virginia Seminary and College in Lynchburg, Virginia, and it's where he had taught his wife, Virginia Ashburn, and from there they moved to Columbus, and that move must have occurred in the '30s [1930s].  And so he was a highly learned man, and because I had indicated a desire to enter the ministry and had become licensed to preach May the 11th, 1960, fifty years ago, many people in the church thought--they had a certain notion about how this school prepared pastors, and that's where they wanted me to go.  I had gotten a scholarship based on a old law that had been discovered by a neighbor, a lawyer who was roaming around the attic of the Ohio state capitol [Ohio Statehouse, Columbus, Ohio], and got me a scholarship to go to Central State University [Central State College; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] about sixty-two miles away.  So I had to choose between Central State and Virginia.  The ministry thing won out.  I went down on the train, never having seen the place, and the first day I saw it I didn't like it, and I was ready to come home; my mother [Bernice Childs Johnson] would not let me.  I should have gone to Central State.  And they had sent me there based on their recollection of the glory days when this school had turned out most of the black Baptist pastors of the nation, back during the day when the entire student body and faculty had gone in support of Marcus Garvey.
Story_ID: 654680
Speaker 1: And so the school was living on its heyday decades past.  But I stayed, and in 1961, Martin King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came to Lynchburg, Virginia to speak, and I didn't know he was coming, and this was gonna be my second time going to hear him.  Maybe I should put in, before I tell you this, that in the tenth grade the superintendent of school was at our church, Oakley Baptist [Oakley Full Gospel Baptist Church, Columbus, Ohio], on a Sunday morning with no warning, took me across town to hear him speak at Union Grove Baptist Church [Columbus, Ohio].  It's the first time I heard him--tenth grader.  And I was impressed, and couldn't figure out why I had been brought, but I was considering the ministry--didn't know for sure, and I had figured out a habit that was a good practice, that when I visited churches, I should go and ask the minister could I look at his study--library.  And I asked Dr. Hale [ph.], a Morehouse man [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], if I could see his study after church, and he said, "Of course, go right in, there's nobody there."  I went in and closed the door and started looking at the books, from the floor to the ceiling, and when I turned around to view the books on the other side of the room, Martin Luther King, Jr. himself was seated in a chair, alone.  I was astounded, and the first thing I thought was the pastor lied to me (laughter); he said nobody was here.  King said, "What's your name?"  I told him.  He said, "Have you considered college?"  I said, "Yes."  He said, "Have you considered Morehouse?"  I said, "Yes."   And I said, "But one of my neighbors talked me out of it."  He said, "Why?"  "He said it wasn't up to snuff."  He then started a very persuasive conversation on why I should consider Morehouse.  Long story short, the neighbor won, and the church people said to me, "Basically, we think that you'd be better off at Virginia [Virginia Theological Seminary and College; Virginia University of Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia] because we think that Morehouse would be too hard for you."
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: That's how I got to Virginia to college.
Story_ID: 654681
Speaker 1: Before we go forward, I just wanna go back a little bit and, and pick up some pieces.  I wanna know about when--I mean you told about the tenth grade you were considering ministry, but when was the first time you felt that you had the call?
Speaker 2: Oh.  My calling was not a Pauline call, of being knocked off some proverbial horse and blinded by a bright light, it didn't happen abruptly; it was a gradual thing from the ninth grade to the twelfth, and it got stronger and stronger by elimination.  And it wasn't until January of the twelfth grade; I was so anguishing that if God wanted me to preach, why didn't he just tell me?  And of course I could hear Bill Cosby's voice, "You know, he doesn't operate like that" (laughter).  Well, one day I was seated in the sanctuary [at Oakley Full Gospel Baptist Church, Columbus, Ohio] trying to decide, and my pastor came down the aisle.  Nobody else was in the sanctuary but me.  And as he passed, I said, "Reverend Ashburn [Jacob Ashburn, Jr.], I think I've been called to preach."  He kept right on going (laughter); didn't say anything.  I was shocked; I thought this would cause for some kind of conversation.  So I watched him go on back to the narthex, and then I decided to sit there until he came back, and he walked right by me and I said, "But I'm nervous about having to preach all these Sundays."  And he said, while passing by me, "I thought you said you were called to preach," (laughter), and he walked right on into his office, and I thought, what's going on?  I was dealing with my ambivalence.  So I followed him into his office and so we talked a moment.  And he said, "Well, if you think you've been called," he says, "I'll set a date for you to preach your trial sermon."  And that was January.  He set the date of May 11th; that gave me time to finish and to graduate [from West Junior and Senior High School; West High School, Columbus, Ohio], though the graduation wasn't 'til June.  I'll never forget--the church was full; it was like a Wednesday night.  My mother [Bernice Childs Johnson] had told everybody.  People from out of town came.  I was as nervous as you can imagine.  I had only preached one other sermon a few Sundays before at a United Methodist church, and I don't know what happened, but the sermon was received thunderously, and the word spread throughout the community, "[HistoryMaker] Lawrence Carter has been called to preach, and you should of heard him last Sunday."  But I had not preached at my church.  And when I finished that sermon, I didn't have another sermon (laughter), so I had to write another sermon.  So I did, and I remember using--I can't even tell you the title of the sermon right now, but I used like these little devotionals, these little handbooks--one of the popular ones; it's not coming to me right now, that everybody knows.
Speaker 1: Daily Word?
Speaker 2: Daily Word--to help me get ready.  And I went in with my little manuscript, and I sat there, really sweating, looking out at all these people, wondering, what do they want to hear?  And I got up and I delivered it.  And I sat down, and the church licensed me.  But I remember I was very disappointed at one of my favorite deacons, Mr. Joseph Gentry [ph.]; he did not make the motion and he did not second it, but he voted in my favor.  I wanted him to make the motion just because I had so much--he was the one who took me to hear Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther, King, Jr.]; I had so much respect for him.  So that is how I started, and I've been struggling ever since (laughter).
Story_ID: 654682
Speaker 1: What was--even before that--oh, there's two things.  Before that, you were probably baptized somewhere around 1954.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: I wanna know about your baptism experience--
Speaker 2: Oh, that was something.
Speaker 1: --and I want to also know if you remember what your--the title of your first sermon was, even though it wasn't at your church [Oakley Full Gospel Baptist Church, Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 2: No.  I've got that sermon (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was--do you know what the topic was about?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, that's fine.
Speaker 2: And you know why I don't remember?	Because some time ago, I looked back at those manuscripts and I said, "Oh, no, I didn't say that."  So I have tried to forget (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.  Before, before we go on--and, and I want you to tell me--well, let's do one thing at a time.  Tell me about your baptism experience.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, this is in the Baptist church?
Speaker 2: In the Baptist church where they don't believe in, in infant baptism, but in believers baptism, and I--people were telling me that they wanted me to be baptized, but I was not gonna be rushed, and I wanted to do it when I felt it.  And when I went down the aisle to--and made the decision, no one knew in advance in my house that I was gonna do it and--but everybody was thrilled.  And when I--I remember that when I came up out of the water, the older women shouted, and one woman, I can see her face--I cannot remember her name--and she said, "I knew,"  she told me that, "when you came up outta that water, that the Holy Spirit was upon you; I knew that you were going to preach."  She told me that over and over and over again.  "I saw it," she said, "I knew."  She was one of the sweet old sisters of the church who's long gone.
Speaker 1: What was your experience?  What did you feel?
Speaker 2: It was very powerful.  First of all, I was being baptized by perhaps the most revered pastor [Jacob Ashburn, Jr.] in the history of the church who was beloved--who was indeed a learned man.  And he was the one who recruited my family to join that church.  It was a hot summer day in 1951.  He was of the old style--sort of cream colored straw hat, white shirts, long sleeves, back in the days when the shirts for men were only three sizes, and you knew it because they had those bands around the sleeve.  If you had on a sleeve that was too long, then you could--and he had those on--suspenders--and black like Johnson and Johnson shoes--Johnson and Murphy [sic. Johnston and Murphy].  And he came down the street on this hot summer day, walking from his house; we lived on the same street, and it's the same street that Jesse Owens lived on.  And he walked up onto our porch and my aunt [Carter's maternal aunt, Eddie Childs Mays] and I were seated on the porch, and he--we welcomed him, and we hadn't met him but we had heard of him.  And he said he has simply come to welcome us to the community.  And he sat down on the porch--the swing--with us, and he must have stayed forty-five minutes and we just chatted.  This is, this is something that has gone; this, this era is gone forever.  And it was because of his visit that we went to the church.
Story_ID: 654683
Speaker 1: But I must tell you something.  Next door to a Highland Avenue elementary school [Highland Elementary School, Columbus, Ohio], where I had enrolled, was a very large Un- Methodist church; it wasn't United Methodist then, it was Un- a Methodist church.  They had a big gymnasium, magnificent sanctuary--stained glass windows that cost over thirty-four thousand [dollars] apiece, and back in those days, that was a whole lotta money.  And I had presumed that it was predominantly white; I didn't know, but it looked like I saw white people going in and out of it.  And when we came across town, my aunt [Carter's maternal aunt, Eddie Childs Mays] said, "Shiloh [Shiloh Baptist Church, Columbus, Ohio] is too far away for you to go to Vacation Bible School, so where do you plan to go?  I've heard that Oakley is down the street."  I said, "I know where I'm going--." I'm fifth grade.  I said, "I'm going to that big church right next to Highland.  I saw their sign on a big canvass in front of the church on the lawn, advertising Vacation Bible School."  I said, "I'm going there."  My aunt stared at me.  She said, "Are you sure you're, you're going there?"  I said, "Oh, yeah."  She said--I remember she was hesitant.  She said, "Are you sure you can go there?"  I said, "Oh, yeah, they're Christian; I saw the cross.  I can go there."  She said, "But they're white."  "Oh," I said, "they'll let me in; they believe in Jesus."  And I went--by myself.  And when I walked into the building, all the white kids were pointing and looking out the doors, and laughing and giggling, and I walked into the office and two white ladies saw me and they both got up and came to me and said, "Oh, what's your name?"  And I said, "[HistoryMaker] Lawrence Carter."  They said, "What may we do for you?"  I said, "I've come for Vacation Bible School."  And they looked at each other and they smiled, and I knew something was up, but I didn't--and they said, "Are you Methodist?"  I said, "Baptist."  They said, "Oh, well have you heard of the Oakley Baptist Church [Oakley Full Gospel Baptist Church, Columbus, Ohio]?"  I said, "Yes."  "Do you know where it is?"  I said, "No, I haven't been there."  They said, "Well, they have a Vacation Bible School; we'll take you there."  And they took me by the hand and marched me out, these two very nice white ladies, past all the children--white children, and they put me in what seemed like a Model T Ford [Ford Model T]--had running boards--even in 1951, all-black, and they drove me a few blocks away, and I arrived in front of a very modest looking one floor, with a basement, church.  And the front door was wide open, and I could see a lady that was sitting in there at a sewing machine, and when they opened the car doors and I got out, she looked up and saw them, and she got from behind the sewing machine and came down the stairs out onto the little plaza as they walked up from the sidewalk, and she had an apron on--a very distinguished looking lady, had Indian [Native American] features.  And they greeted her warmly like they knew her, and said, "Virginia [Virginia Ashburn], we have brought you a wonderful young man for Vacation Bible School."  And she, receiving me, said, "Oh, thank you so much; I'm sure he'll be very happy here."  And I'm watching all this, looking up at them, and watching the ladies go back to their car, and she took me, putting hands on my shoulders, and walked me up the steps into the church, past the sewing machine, through the narthex, but they call it a vestibule, into the sanctuary.  Something happened to me psychologically.  There was a trauma there.  I had been rejected by the church of Jesus, by white people, but I had been warmly welcomed by black people at a Baptist church.  Something about denominations--I was Baptist, they were Methodist, they were white; that went through my mind.  What does this mean?
Story_ID: 654684
Speaker 1: There is a difference because, you see, one of the things that I didn't tell you that has now come back to me, was the first interracial experience I had in Dawson, Georgia at a minstrel show where there was a man that came to town selling a tonic to cure all ills, and when we arrived in Dawson at the minstrel show, there was a rope down the middle of the chairs, and all the blacks were on the right and all the whites were on the left, and I was seated on the end, right on the aisle, and I sat there the whole time staring at that rope, and staring at the whites, and looking at the blacks, and thinking, with a smile on my face--I'll never forget this--they're no different from us.  I'm gonna tear that rope down.  I am gonna tear that rope down.  And the year that I had this experience, I think, must have been something like 1948--on a trip back to Georgia, and Uncle Mud took me to this minstrel show.
Speaker 2: Did you tear the rope down?
Speaker 1: Yes.  After Martin King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] did the initial work, then I started mine (laughter).
Speaker 2: This was in 1948--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --and was there any repercussion for you taking down the rope?
Speaker 1: Yes.  There's always been resistance in the black community because my method of taking down the rope was to make real the whole notion of integration.  I didn't see any need for separatism in my ministry, and so I would go to white churches, black churches, and all of my jobs I invited black preachers and white preachers to my pulpit.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But not everybody wanted to go.
Speaker 2: Because you opened the door and went back, talking about a minstrel show, just tell me what a minstrel show was like--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and what you thought about minstrel shows at that time.
Speaker 1: Well, first of all, I remember doubting that there could be a tonic that could cure everything (laughter).  Secondly, the whole notion of black face on white men, it's always been insulting to me, even at a young age.  It was always amazing to me how people laughed, both black and white, at what they saw, and I've often thought it was just another example of how African Americans, back then colored people, had bought into white definitions, and how whites have absolute ties to race, and lifted it to the level--to an ontological level and a metaphysical level; in other words, they have imbued race with a moral meaning, a moral value.  And race, like nationality and ethnicity or culture and sexual orientation, are morally neutral.  Why?  Because a person's race, nationality, and ethnicity, and sexual orientation won't tell you one thing about their moral character.  And so--the thing, maybe, that I can conclude this sentence with is that Martin King was a cosmopolitan, and I am a cosmopolitan--a world citizen.  None of those categories that I named define--should define us.
Story_ID: 654685
Speaker 1: One question I had--you were talking about getting ready to go to college and that one of the deacons had--was--had found an old law that would allow you to go to Central State [Central State College; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  Do you know what this old law was?
Speaker 2: No, I actually don't, but it was a law that had not been used; it was discovered by a black lawyer--I think his last name was also Carter.  I know he was the brother of Rosa Triggs--Rosa Carter Triggs [ph.], who had helped me with that, that speech, but he was a government official in Ohio and found this law on the books in the Ohio Legislature, and because Mrs. Triggs was aware of that, told her brother about me, and he made it possible for me.  The scholarship was not a complete scholarship; it was like a two thirds scholarship; it was gonna pay for two thirds of my education at Central State, and of course I think I would have been very different if I had gone there.
Speaker 1: Why?  How so?
Speaker 2: Because being a state school, unlike Virginia Seminary and College [Virginia Theological Seminary and College], which today is Virginia University of Lynchburg [Lynchburg, Virginia], there was a great deal--see, we went to chapel every day at Virginia, and because of that experience alone--four years of that, I heard the greatest preachers in the country; greatest black preachers in the country used to come there, and William Augustus Jones [William A. Jones] was one of them, and I ended up doing my Ph.D. dissertation on him at Boston University [Boston University School of Theology, Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: The other quest- I'm sorry (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And--yeah, he was the revivalist at Court Street Baptist Church [Lynchburg, Virginia] under Harold Alphonso Carter [Harold A. Carter, Sr.], who's now pastor of New Shiloh [New Shiloh Baptist Church] in Baltimore [Maryland].  But because of that, that's the church I joined, and was a member of for four years as assistant to Harold Carter, and it's fascinating because Harold Carter was the assistant of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] at Dexter [Dexter Avenue Baptist Church; Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church] in Montgomery [Alabama] when he was at Alabama State [Alabama State College; Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama].  Some say that, more than anybody else, Harold Carter inherited Martin King's charisma, and many wanted him to lead the movement but he said it just wasn't in him.
Story_ID: 654686
Speaker 1: So, there were benefits to going to Virginia [Virginia Theological Seminary and College; Virginia University of Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia] to college, and perhaps one of the decisive ones was that John Daniel Manning [ph.], my math teacher, one day surprised me with the announcement, "You're going with me tonight."  I said, "Where are we going?"  He said, "I'm taking you to E.C. Glass, to the E.C. Glass High School [Lynchburg, Virginia].  It's a white high school with the largest auditorium in the city that seated four thousand.  I said, "And why are we going there?"  He said, "Because you're gonna hear Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]."  And I remember we walked; it was that close to the campus--walked to the high school, and that night I heard a speech that changed my life, a speech that was so powerful.  It was The American Dream, not to be confused with I Have a Dream.  It was 1961.  And that was the greatest speech I had ever heard in my life, and I measured all speeches for many years after that, even after I heard the I Have a Dream speech in '63 [1963].  I thought it could not compare to The American Dream.  And so that speech had four crescendos, four climaxes, four unanimous standing ovations, and each one higher; I'd never heard oratory like that.  I went back to the campus and called my mother [Bernice Childs Johnson] and told her that I was transferring to Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia].  If anybody who could speak like that, I wanted to be taught by the same teachers.  She said, "No, you're not."  I did not know until my mother's funeral, 2008--she was eighty-five.  I did not realize that she had said no to me in 1961 because she couldn't afford it; she was working three to four jobs to put me through Virginia, and she believed that Morehouse was gonna cost more.  I had no idea what it was gonna cost, but she thought it was a bigger school.  The--she--I disappointed her in one way, and only one thing in my entire life.  She wanted me to go to Ohio State University [The Ohio State University] right there in Columbus [Ohio].  For Ohio citizens it was pennies.  I didn't wanna go there because I had grown up there and I was quite familiar with the announcements in The Columbus Dispatch newspaper, every quarter, of how many students flunked out of Ohio State.  And with people telling me that I couldn't write, they're telling me that I could barely read, I thought I would be a statistic.  Nobody encouraged me to apply there; in fact, the only place, the only place I was encouraged to apply to was Virginia, and one person, maybe two, wanted me to go to Central State [Central State College; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  So, when she gave me that stunning news, which was the very first and only time she ever denied me, I remember hanging up in absolute shock, and it was that night, after that conversation, that I made the decision that from then on my education would be in my hands.
Story_ID: 654687
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you, before this time, had you never had a job?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, and that's a very good question.  I always wanted a job when I was a teenager, but my mother [Bernice Childs Johnson] wouldn't let me have one.  She said that it wasn't time yet, and she said that what she was concerned about, that I was gonna get oriented too quickly to money.  She said that she wanted me to have a job that I enjoyed, and that gave me meaning in life, not a job that paid me a certain amount a money, and she wanted to drill that into my head.  So, the first job I had was throwing papers, with virtually no pay; the second job was setting pins in a bowling alley, and I set pins all day, and when I went to collect my money, the man said, "I'm not gonna give you a dime."  That was my introduction to the corruption of human nature.  I was crushed; he was white, and I thought it was most cruel, but I soon came to conclude that was the way the universe was getting me ready to understand the words of Jesus, "Be as wise as a serpent and as harmless as a dove" [Matthew 10:16].  So that was a vaccination--that betrayal was a vaccination against other potential betrayals.  So, then, I was a very unhappy teenager one summer in Vacation Bible School because I was the biggest kid in Vacation Bible School at Oakley [Oakley Full Gospel Baptist Church, Columbus, Ohio], and I had spent time previous years helping the teachers, and they considered me wiser than my years; I was more mature than a teenager of my years, and very serious, but I knew that they knew that I was not happy, and that I was restless and I wanted to do something, and one day in Vacation Bible School, I was told that Mrs. Mary Claytor [Mary Martin Claytor] wanted to see me; she was the head of the Vacation Bible School.  And I went to her office and she said, "How would you like to be a camp counsellor?"  My face lit up like a neon sign.  I said, "Yes, I would like to be a camp counsellor.  Where?"  She said, "Camp Wheeler [Chesterville, Ohio], about sixty-two miles north of the city."  She said, "I've just gotten a call from Jake Young [ph.], and they--the camp had just started; it's only about two or three days old, and they've had to fire the counsellor in charge of the oldest kids for breaking some law, some policy--procedure they had, so he's gone, and they've asked me to recommend somebody, and I told him that I thought you were the right person because of your maturity and your seriousness."  He said, "But how old are you?"  No, she said to me, "How old are you?"  I said, "I'm sixteen."  She says, "These young men are eighteen, but they'll never know that you're sixteen, and I'm going to recommend you."  I said, "When do I start?"  She said, "Right now.  Rush home."  She said, "I've already called your house.  Your aunt [Carter's maternal aunt, Eddie Childs Mays] knows, and they said it's fine.  Pack, and come back to the church, and there'll be a driver that would come and will pick you up and take you."  I left and celebrated all the way home, several hundred yards away (laughter), threw stuff in a bag, and I was on the Camp Wheeler campus in no time.
Story_ID: 654688
Speaker 1: I had about five young men.  I had an experience there [Camp Wheeler, Chesterville, Ohio] that turned out to be decisive in my life.  This was my first job, and one of the things the camp director said to me was, "Each of the cabins shares responsibility for straightening up the dining hall and mopping the floor in the dining room once a week, and it's your dorm's time this evening, so get your guys and get them down to the mess hall after dinner."  So, I went into the dorm and the guys were on their separate beds--their bunkbeds, and I announced that--what we had to do, and I walked out the door and said, "I'll meet you down there."  I got down to the bottom of the hill and looked back, and I didn't see any activity, no movement; nobody was coming out of the cabin to follow me.  I thought that was strange, so I went back up and repeated myself and walked out again.  But I didn't go quite as far when I realized they didn't move, and I was shocked and I looked at the building and I started doubting myself.  I said, "Can I do this?  These guys are paying me no attention."  So, I walked over to the--what we call the white house--the director's house, and I saw, as I was approaching the lake, that he and his wife were seated on the dock; it was a dock that went around the swimming area in the lake.  And I noticed they were washing clothes in the lake, and I walked over onto the dock toward them and they never looked up at me, and I said, "Jake [Jake Young (ph.)], I can't get these guys to move--to go down to the dining hall."  Says, "They're ignoring me, and I've asked them twice now."  Jake and his wife Marie [ph.] never looked up at me and continued to dip clothes into the lake, take them out, squeeze them, lay them on the dock.  And I watched them and I wondered did they hear me, but I was so close I knew they did.  And I tried to figure out what the meaning of this was.  Eventually, as I stood there, I heard Jake say, never looking at me, "I wouldn't let any cheap punk keep me from having my first job."  I heard every word, and I stared at him and at his wife.  They never looked at me, and I started backing up 'til I had backed off of the dock onto the campus, and I turned and slowly started walking up the hill looking at my cabin, and by the time I got to the bottom of the hill on which sat the cabin where the guys were, I had acquired a defiant determination.  I opened the door and there they were; I didn't say a word.  I walked over to the first bed, reached down, grabbed the leg and turned the bed over, and I said, "Get down to the cafeteria, and I'll meet you there!"  And this kid fell on the floor, and all the guys jumped up and ran out the back door and came around the building, and when I went down the hill this time, they were behind me.  All the way to the cafeteria the universe was saying, "You have become a man now; you are in charge and you have, you have your first paying job."  I have always wanted to be in charge somewhere.

Speaker 1: If we could go back to--your mother [Bernice Childs Johnson] had just told you that you could not transfer to Morehouse and you said that you took your education into your hands at that point--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and tell me what you meant by that.
Speaker 2: I decided that if I could not go to Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] and fulfill Martin King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] recruitment wish, which now was coming into focus as far more significant, and that I had missed an opportunity, probably the opportunity of my life, because I believe if I had come here, I'd be president now.  But, that was water over the dam.  If I couldn't go to Morehouse, then I would do the second best thing possible, that I would get the rest of all of my education at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] where he went, where I could be taught by some of the same professors who might still be there.  So, in my junior year, I went to Dr. C.M. Cofield [Curtis Cofield], my psychology professor, whose home was near the campus; I went to his home--and his wife [Elsie Watson Cofield] was my reading teacher--and I told him about my dream.  He gave me--I don't know whether it was thirty-nine or sixty-nine dollars--for a Greyhound trip, maybe that was two way, to Boston [Massachusetts] to look the school over.  I went up there--that was my first time in New York City [New York, New York] on the bus.  Port Authority [Port Authority Bus Terminal] scared me to death (laughter).  I got off, and we had to--a little stopover.  But they interviewed me at Boston, I saw Marsh Chapel [Boston, Massachusetts], talked to the dean, Dean Walter Muelder [Walter G. Muelder], who signed Martin King's degree, and who signed mine eventually.  He recruited me; he told me that the previous year, Boston University School of Theology [Boston, Massachusetts] had recruited no blacks.  He said this was unusual because Boston University had gradated more blacks at the doctorate level than any university in the country, and had graduated the first woman, I think, in the country, of the major universities and the first black psychiatrist in the nation--Solomon Carter Fuller, for whom one of the big buildings in the medical center [Solomon Carter Fuller Mental Health Center, Boston, Massachusetts] is named there.  So, to make a long story short, I was accepted at Boston University in my junior year of college from Virginia Seminary [Virginia Seminary and College; Virginia University of Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia] in college.  And let me tell you, that was history and that was news all over Virginia and Ohio.  I mean it shocked the hell out of a lot of people, and the faculty were so proud of me--everybody was.  And Mrs. Cofield, who is still living--Dr. Cofield, her husband, died only recently, and I sent a tribute to be read at the service, and I had already gone to New Haven [Connecticut] to honor Mrs. Cofield.  Mrs. Cofield said, "If you're going to Boston, I want to work with you to help get you ready, to strengthen you."  And she spent many evenings with me, strengthening my reading while I was at Virginia--and the rest is history.  I can go into more detail later.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so in your junior year, you actually go to Boston?
Speaker 2: No, I was accepted my junior year (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You're accepted your junior year.
Speaker 2: --and I stayed and finished my--
Speaker 1: Okay, so--okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 654690
Speaker 1: One more thing before we go on to your graduation--well, getting your degree at, at Virginia [Virginia Seminary and College; Virginia University of Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia], in Virginia, is that you said that you, you did your trial sermon--this was in 1960, and you were licensed.  Tell me what the difference is between being licensed and ordained.
Speaker 2: Well, being licensed simply gives you an opportunity to sit in the pulpit, read scripture, and pray.  In order to perform what we call in the Baptist church, the ordinances, in the Catholic church they might call them the sacraments.
Speaker 1: In other words, give communion.
Speaker 2: Give communion, do funerals, weddings, baptisms--you have to be ordained.  And so the idea is that being licensed gives you a chance to exercise your talent to, to practice preaching, and it sort of sets you off.  But you see, some denominations are very concerned about easy access to power and influence in the church, and so the ministry is probably one of the easiest routes to leadership in the black community, and there are a lot of people who go into ministry for that purpose, and for the wrong reason; they go in frequently to the ministry for personal needs rather than to minister to the people; they go in to be ministered to.  And so the separation of these two is frequently characterized by a requirement that you can't be ordained until you have finished seminary, though in the Baptist church, that's very inconsistently practiced.  But I was not ordained until I finished seminary [Boston University School of Theology, Boston, Massachusetts] because I wanted to be ordained by the American Baptists [American Baptist Churches USA] who have a more rigid set of requirements than, let's say, other conventions--traditionally black conventions.
Story_ID: 654691
Speaker 1: Before we go on to your getting your degree also, we're in the, the era of civil rights, and talk to me about what you know about the landscape in Ohio, and in Virginia because that's where you are--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --when--in '63 [1963]--the March on Washington.  What's, what's going on in, in your world?
Speaker 2: Now, the landscape racially in Ohio--I was--I didn't have a deep knowledge of.  Some fascinating points.  I never heard my aunt [Carter's maternal aunt, Eddie Childs Mays] or my mother [Bernice Childs Johnson] say a negative word about white people in my life--never--that I can recall.  And yet I know that there was a lot of talk about the death of Emmett Till, though that occurred in Mississippi, I believe.  But it was--the pictures were in Jet magazine, and I know that arrived at my house.  Now, I know that my aunt was very much aware of discrimination because what I shared with you about how she responded when I wanted to go to the, to the Glenwood United Methodist Church [Columbus, Ohio], and yet, as I listened to her to very accurately define what her concern was, she never went there--she wouldn't verbalize negativity.  They never demonized anybody; they were the most, I think, practiced Christians of my youth.  Now, there was a discrimination, and the scene that I remember most vividly was when I was preparing to graduate from high school [West Junior and Senior High School; West High School, Columbus, Ohio] with my class being--it was 315 of us in my class, and they were preparing the activities surrounding commencement, like prom, an all-night event, an early morning hotel breakfast, a swimming party at the Hague Avenue pool, which was an all-white pool near the high school, and the high school was on the boundary between one level of economic living and a more advanced, upgraded community that everybody wanted to get to.  The Hague Avenue pool turned the request down for the class to have its pool party there.  The reason?  Blacks were in our class.  When the news reached the high school, I remember the class officers were stunned, and the message went forth immediately; we didn't have to get together to vote.  "The party will not be at that location for anybody.  If the blacks can't come, the whites can't come either."  I was very proud of them.  That is one bit of discrimination--maybe the only one that I remember.
Story_ID: 654692
Speaker 1: I remember in the eighth grade--this might surprise you.  You remember the--I almost called his name.  The, the Gary Powers reconnaissance flight that was shot down over Russia during the presidency of Dwight David Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower], whose inauguration I stayed out of class in the--1954 [sic. 1953], to watch on television in the elementary school auditorium; I wasn't supposed to but I did.  Well, I thought America was the land of the free and the home of the brave, and I thought our government told the truth and would never be engaging in spying.  So, when Eisenhower came on national television and announced that Gary Powers was spying over Russia, that shattered my innocence about the United States, and without knowing it, I had discovered the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] (laughter).  And that was during the time when Senator Eugene McCarthy [sic. Joseph McCarthy] thought there was a Communist under every rock (laughter).  And so I joined in the high school [West Junior and Senior High School; West High School, Columbus, Ohio] the Un-American Activities Club because I thought all of our hearts were red, white and blue.  This was another period of losing my innocence.
Speaker 2: You said the un-American?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Activities club, because--you know, Senator McCarthy, I think, was from Wisconsin.  He was on a rampage; he thought that the nation had been infiltrated by Communists, and they had all these hearing on Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.], and they had the whole nation upset.  And of course you remember Sputnik was launched during this period, and I saw the biggest shift I have ever seen in life, in American higher education, when all of a sudden an emphasis on math occurred because it was felt that the Russians were gonna beat us into outer space.  So, by the time John Kennedy's [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] inauguration and his call for us to land a man on the moon, and then us doing it the first year of my marriage [to Marva Griffin Carter]--'69 [1969], '70 [1970], as a result of all of this emphasis on math in the eighth grade--my eighth grade, I saw how a nation could be inspired and could operate to get ahead, and so I believed the same thing could happen on civil rights and discrimination, and I always believed that King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was gonna win because there was nobody more inspiring and more eloquent than he was, so that's why he became my hero.  And he is the one--he's one of the two people that sent me to Boston University [Boston University School of Theology, Boston, Massachusetts]--inspired me to go there; the other one--and this causes me to give you a missing piece--
Story_ID: 654693
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, I wanted to know what the Un-American Club [Un-American Activities Club]--what did you learn?  What do you accomplish by being a part of this?
Speaker 2: It was about--are you ready?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: It's, it's all about patriotism--loyalty to the United States.  It was about practicing real and true democracy.  But the fascinating thing was it had a lukewarm application to black citizens, and it always has.  There's always been a demand or an imperative that black citizens be loyal and committed to the nation and to the [U.S.] Constitution, even when they weren't fully supportive of our rights.  If it had been otherwise, there would have been no need for a Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  And so there I was, an African American kid in a majority junior and senior high school [West Junior and Senior High School; West High School, Columbus, Ohio] in the 1950s, and I was trying not to be different, and I really didn't see any big difference between Christianity as a civil religion and what the government was preaching, you know.  The flag was in the church, in the school, we crossed our chest, we did the Pledge of Allegiance, and I thought that every president was a Christian, and all the senators--you know, the higher you went, I thought that you were able to--and you put your hand on the Bible to be sworn in--I thought America was a Christian nation and the Communists were atheists; and I thought they were going to hell, and they didn't love Jesus, and I thought America did, you know.  I was--I guess I, I drank the Kool-Aid, got the tee shirt (laughter), the potato chips--everything (laughter), you know.  I was very naive, which is dangerous.
Story_ID: 654694
Speaker 1: Now, we left off when you're in your junior year at Virginia [Virginia Seminary and College; Virginia University of Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia], you go to Boston [Boston University School of Theology, Boston, Massachusetts], you get accepted; and then tell me what happens next because this should be around the time of the March on Washington, am I right?
Speaker 2: Well, I arrived in Boston [Massachusetts] in '64 [1964]; the March on Washington was '63 [1963] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: I was in Virginia at--in college when Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was assassinated, I was there when King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] gave the August 28th, 1963 I Have a Dream speech, Kennedy was November 22nd; I experienced all those things there--the trauma, the pain, the shock.  We jumped up every morning, my roommate and I, and said, "Let's turn on the radio and see what Caroline [Caroline Kennedy] is saying."  The first family album was out.  We worshipped the Kennedys.  The BBC [British Broadcasting Corporation] said it was the first time that royalty had come to the White House [Washington, D.C.], and we believed it.  We were scared over the Cuban Missile Crisis, but we comforted ourselves by saying, "It doesn't matter, John Kennedy will speak tonight, and he's so eloquent, he'll get the rapport--everybody laughing, and this will be over."  But we were scared, and we were walking around looking up at the sky, wondering if we'd see the missiles fly.  But it was the most inspiring time in American history, the '60s [1960s]--but especially from '60 [1960] to '63 [1963].  You had John Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Ralph Nader, Pope John XXIII [Saint Pope John XXIII], you had Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy], you had all of this inspiring rhetoric filling the airwaves, then eventually you had Malcolm X, you had Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.].  It's just phenomenal.  There's never been a decade so uplifting for a generation of youth.  We felt we could do anything, and one by one we saw the lights go out on every one of them.  It was depressing.
Story_ID: 654695
Speaker 1: And then we had to deal with Tricky Dick [President Richard Milhous Nixon].
Speaker 2: Well, even before that--well, go ahead, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: That was 1968 when he was elected.  We admired Lyndon Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson], but the Vietnam War, it made no sense to us.  I was a part of the "Hell no, we will not go," but I had a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was my, my next question.
Speaker 1: I, I had a 4-D classification; that's an ex- that is a clergy exemption.  But I participated in the marches.  In Lynchburg, Virginia I was in charge of the mimeograph machine for the demonstrations.  Virgil Wood [Virgil A. Wood], one of my college professors, pastor of Diamond Hill Baptist Church [Lynchburg, Virginia], he was the Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] of Lynchburg; it's like the SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] representative.  We had huge rallies at Court Street Baptist Church [Lynchburg, Virginia] that could easily seat over two thousand people, and that's where I was assistant with Harold Carter [Harold A. Carter, Sr.].  So I was--I had a front row seat in the pulpit and on the first row of the sanctuary when we had the big gatherings, and I marched with Virgil Wood.  And then he went to Boston [Massachusetts], and I marched with him there, and was his assistant there.  And he was--he hosted me when I first went up there for that--
Speaker 2: For the interview?
Speaker 1: --for the interview.  He and his wife [Lillian Walker Wood] had me over to their house for dinner.
Speaker 2: Did you march for civil rights as well, or just for the Vietnam War?
Speaker 1: Yes, I marched for civil rights.
Speaker 2: Oh, because the--you know, the way it sounded is that you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, I marched for civil rights in Lynchburg, Virginia--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I marched for Vietnam--against Vietnam War in Boston.  But when Martin King came to Boston to lead one march, led by Virgil Wood, I made a deliberate decision not to go because I was in the process of proving that I was strong enough to pass everything at Boston University [Boston University School of Theology, Boston, Massachusetts], and I had to make crucial decision of whether to stay at my desk or participate in the march.  I'd made a decision that--the degree was a three year degree--I made a decision that I would get it in four years in order to get the best grades, not rush, that would qualify me to apply for a second master's [degree]--would put me in striking distance of the Ph.D.  It all worked.  I said, "I'm a rabbit, not a hound," and I went at my pace, and I'm the only one in my class to get the Ph.D.
Story_ID: 654696
Speaker 1: So, tell me, what, what made you decide to stay in Virginia and not go to Boston [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: What made me decide to stay at Virginia [Virginia Seminary and College; Virginia University of Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia] after I got accepted in my junior year?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I was not accepted to the undergraduate college at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts]; I was accepted at the graduate school.  I was accepted to the graduate school of theology, so I had to--I--they wouldn't admit me unless I had the Virginia degree (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: I had to stay at Virginia and complete that.  But it was unprecedented what they did.  They sent me a signal--let me put it more plainly so you really get it this time.  They were practicing affirmative action before it had been formulized, and they bent over backwards to maintain their tradition of recruiting blacks every year; they didn't want not to have blacks two years in a row in the School of Theology [Boston University School of Theology, Boston, Massachusetts].  So in other words, I'm very grateful to Walter George Muelder [Walter G. Muelder]--his picture is right behind you--for the faith that he put in me.  Every time that faith has been expressed in me, the people who invested it have never been disappointed, but getting people to do that when they want to evaluate you downward, that's where the great leap of faith comes in.
Speaker 1: The March on Washington, were you there?
Speaker 2: No.  I was seated in my living room in my pajamas in Columbus, Ohio, and when--see, I couldn't afford to go.
Speaker 1: But I thought you were still in, in Virginia during that time.
Speaker 2: That's right, 1963.  My mother [Bernice Childs Johnson] was paying for my being there--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --so I was at home that summer.  I remember that was August--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --twenty-eighth; I would be leaving shortly to return to college, but I was in the living room watching the TV by myself, and to this day I can't remember exactly how I knew that was all happening, but I must have heard it advertised.  And so I watched that on TV and I remember when Martin King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] finished that speech [I Have a Dream], in my pajamas--I had on my robe.  I got up and I ran around the room (laughter) in a circle, and I just shouted, and I knew that was one of the great speeches of history.  And that further made him my mentor and my hero, and that further sealed that I had made the right choice that I was going to Boston University.  But I should tell you, if I can just leap ahead just for a brief moment, I believe that on the train, on my way up there, that when the train arrived in Boston because I had been there, I kept looking out the window to see whether I could recognize anything, and the train went under a bridge--the St. Mary Street bridge [sic. St. Marys Street bridge]--at Boston University, and I spotted the tower of the School of Theology, and I honestly think I must have fainted because I don't remember anything until I got in the train station.
Story_ID: 654697
Speaker 1: Well, tell me what year did you actually get your degree from Virginia [Virginia Seminary and College; Virginia University of Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 1: And that was in social science and psychology?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And when did you obtain your degree in divinity [from the Boston University School of Theology, Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968].  And note the year; that was a commencement.  And that--and this picture right here, that's my seminary graduation picture.
Speaker 1: Well, wrap up your, your days at, at Virginia, and--
Speaker 2: Well, you'll be interested to know that my commencement speaker was my pastor, Jacob Ashburn [Jacob Julian Ashburn].  And this was fitting, coming back to where his mother [Virginia Ashburn] and father [Jacob Ashburn, Jr.] had met, his father had taught, and he had just come out of the hospital.  He had been taken to court seven times for court depositions because he had basically gotten the youth of the church to vote, with a few of the adults, to move the congregation to the sanctuary of the Glenwood Methodist Church [Glenwood United Methodist Church, Columbus, Ohio], and many of the old folk didn't wanna go because they had had visions and dreams of building a new church on that site, but the pastor felt that we could never build a facility, he said, like the Methodist had, and the teenagers wanted that gym.  But it had caused him some health problems, and he was just recuperating at the time the invitation came because it meant he was going to receive an honorary doctorate of divinity degree, and he was the speaker, and it was fitting since I was--had, had been elected president of the senior class.  There were only thirty-four, thirty-five in my graduating class.
Speaker 1: And how many black?
Speaker 2: All black.
Speaker 1: All black.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was a historically black college [HBCU].
Speaker 1: About the church and, and wanting to move the congregation.  Now, had the community or neighborhood changed so much that the white Methodists were now not in that neighborhood (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were moving further out. They had built a brand new church, a beautiful sanctuary, and they were moving closer to their members.
Story_ID: 654698
Speaker 1: So, what happens next, as far as graduation and, and your completion at Virginia [Virginia Seminary and College; Virginia University of Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Well, I had served all those summers, from the age of sixteen, as a camp counselor and a camp director--Camp Wheeler [Chesterville, Ohio] and Camp Mary Orton [Columbus, Ohio], and then for the Boys Clubs of America [Boys and Girls Clubs of America], I served at another campsite in southern Ohio; that's how I had supplemented my mother's support of me.  But an interesting thing happened.  The summer that I graduated from college, I went once again to do the camp director's job in a decentralized setting; it wasn't cabins, we lived in tents, and at the end of that summer--and I gave those kids wonderful experiences--cooking out, even making the oven, making a pie in the woods, hiking, building huts.  I developed a hiccup.  Camp ended and I knew I had to get ready to go to Boston [Massachusetts].  I went to the doctor and the doctor said, "This is not good."  The hiccup lasted for over twenty-four hours, and the doctor said, "I don't think you're going to be strong enough to go to Boston."  He says, "You really need a vacation, a break--somewhere you can go and relax."  But my mother [Bernice Childs Johnson] could not afford to send me anywhere, but at the camp, I had developed a new friend by the name of David Paul DeNoon [ph.].  Dave was white, and was a member of the great First Community Church of Upper Arlington [Ohio]; it was one of the wealthy communities in the city.  It was a non-denominational church; in fact, they had forty-two denominations under one roof--seven thousand members.  And I had been introduced to this church and the newspapers--and when the pastor, Dr. Maxfield [Otis Maxfield], came to address the careers day at the college and they brought him to the group where all the future clergy were gathered, and he invited me up to the church, and some ladies had already taken me there from Oakley [Oakley Full Gospel Baptist Church, Columbus, Ohio] for a racial seminar, and I was most impressed with what I saw.  And all this happened in the tenth grade.  And I started subscribing to his sermons.  And he was--Maxfield was a Ph.D. from Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] in pastoral psychology and counseling, so King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and Maxfield were the big influences to go, and Maxfield was my reference for all of my degrees; he was one of my references--all of them.  So--I lost my train of thought.  I was telling you--
Speaker 1: You're--about the hiccup.
Speaker 2: The hiccup, yes.  So, I called Dave DeNoon--no, he called me and I told him how I was doing; we'd become good friends.  And he said--I told him what the doctor had said, so he said, "I'll call you back."  When he called back, he said, "I've spoken to my parents and my parents think that you should go to Huckleberry Island off the coast of Parry Sound, Canada, where my parents own a cabin, and that's where you should vacation to get you ready for Boston."  I went, and just the two of us palled around on this little island, just the--nobody else--for a week.  I went water skiing in the deepest water--I cannot swim.  I had on two life preservers.  I went hunting for fool's gold, we cooked on the beach, the hiccups went away, and I was ready for Boston.
Story_ID: 654699
Speaker 1: And I--just to tell you, many years later--see, David [David Paul DeNoon (ph.)] graduated from Ohio State University [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio]; he wanted to be a doctor, so he applied to Tulane medical college [Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana] and got in, in Louisiana, but he didn't like it.  By that time I had finished seminary and I was working on the second master's [degree], and I was now married [to Marva Griffin Carver] and living in a huge dorm, one of the biggest in the world, at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts], and he called me and told me that he was not happy.  So I said, "Why don't you come and vacation with me one summer."  So he did, and he stayed in the dorm, and I drove him around town.  And on the tour, I drove him by the medical college at Boston University School of Medicine [Boston, Massachusetts], and he said, "Oh, you know, I, I applied here."  I said, "Oh, very good, very good."  He says, "I wonder if they still have my application."  I said, "Let's park and find out."  So I parked, he ran in, they had his application still on file and they told him he could transfer.  On the spot they accepted him.  He transferred from Tulane, and the rest is history.  I performed his wedding, and I gave him a job, and that was beginning of payback--a thank you for the Huckleberry Sound--Parry Sound [Canada], Huckleberry Island relaxation, recuperation.
Story_ID: 654700
Speaker 1: One thing I wanted to ask you is--we didn't talk about in your childhood, how you would have learned how to do all these things at camp.  It was like when you first went to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's a very good question.
Speaker 1: --went to the camp [Camp Wheeler, Chesterville, Ohio], you know.
Speaker 2: And you know what?  How I'm gonna answer this question and respond to it will also kind of answer the question of how did I score so highly, or noteworthily, on the California personality exam [California Psychological Inventory] for architecture?  And I have an interesting answer for you.  The East Side community that I lived in in Columbus [Ohio], which I told you some people would describe as a ghetto, we lived in a cold water flat.  Behind that cold water flat was a junkyard--a big junkyard, and the kids used to play--my playmates, we used to play in it, and the one thing we did in the junkyard was build houses, and sit by the door; in case they fell, we could get out quickly (laughter).  And we used to just take the junk and make different designs of stuff, and I didn't know what had happened until one day, years later at Boston University [Boston University School of Theology, Boston, Massachusetts], when I was the acting director of the Martin Luther King Center for--Martin Luther King African American Cultural Center [ph.], and I had a big staff, and I did some decorating.  Bishop Roy Nichols [Roy C. Nichols], of the United Methodist Church, walked into my office on the second floor on Bay State Road, and he said, "This place is beautiful.  Who did this?"  And I said, "I did."  And he said, "You know, you have an interesting ability to create functional space."  And for years I've thought about that, and I heard it, even regarding this room.  And I tried to figure out how did I acquire this talent?  I think I did--in the junkyard playing with stuff that people had thrown away, creating new toys.  This is what poor kids do.
Story_ID: 654701
Speaker 1: You said that when you get to Boston [Massachusetts]--well, let me, let me clarify some dates.  In '68 [1968], you get your divinity degree, and your Ph.D. in what year?
Speaker 2: I received the master's of divinity in '68 [1968], the master's of sacred theology in '70 [1970], and I completed the Ph.D. in '78 [1978] and received the degree at the commencement of '79 [1979].
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, you also mentioned that you get married in 1969?
Speaker 2: Sixty-nine [1969].
Speaker 1: Tell me how you met your wife and who she is.
Speaker 2: Marva Griffin--Marva Lois Griffin [Marva Griffin Carter], named after her mother [Lois King Griffin], was a blind date.  I had had many dates through what was called in Boston, Operation Match.  Because I hadn't succeeded with the young ladies, I saw advertised in the newspaper that I could send all of my specifications--my biography--into a big computer sys- program at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] that would match my bio with several young ladies, and they would send me a printout of all the matches in terms of contact information, and so I tried that, and had a--breakfast dates and luncheon dates--nice young ladies, but not complete match.  So, I said to my roommate, "I'm gonna try one more time, then I'm gonna take my love life out of God's hands," (laughter).  And at the time, I was in my senior year of seminary, and I had been appointed the Baptist counselor to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts].  Because I hadn't finished seminary, I couldn't be a chaplain yet, so I had a letter writing ministry to about five hundred students at Boston University who had identified that they were Baptist, and I had office hours in the chaplain center and I had an office for them to come to if they wanted to chat with me about any counseling problem.  But for the most part, it was a letter writing ministry.  Well, the head of that was--Ernie Klein [Ernst Klein] was pastor of the Old Cambridge Baptist Church in Harvard Square [Cambridge, Massachusetts], and one Sunday afternoon, he convened all of the campus ministers from around Massachusetts, 'cause he was the head of the Baptist Campus Ministry Foundation [ph.].  He convened us at his house for dessert and so we could meet each other, and we had a good time.  But as we were all leaving, he and his wife were standing at the door there in Cambridge [Massachusetts] near Harvard Square, and Mrs. Klein [Clara Klein Gallup] said, "Do you have a girlfriend?"  And I said, "Yes, but the relationship is on the rocks and it probably by fall will be over."  She's young lady--her name was--Cheryl Bibbs [Cheryl Susheel Bibbs] was an opera major at New England Conservatory [New England Conservatory of Music, Boston, Massachusetts], and I'd taken her on a date, the last date, with another couple from School of Theology [Boston University School of Theology, Boston, Massachusetts]; took her to the Boston University, Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] football game, and when it came time to sing the National Anthem ['The Star Spangled Banner'], the whole stadium stood, and she proceeded to sing the anthem like she was at Carnegie Hall [New York, New York], and the whole area around us just--everybody just froze; everybody looked around (laughter) because she just behaved like Leontyne Price or [HistoryMaker] Jessye Norman.  I was totally embarrassed.  Then we went, after the game, to get something to eat.  We went to a hamburger place and we all looked at the menu and people picked--I picked a grilled cheese sandwich (laughter) 'cause that's got a (unclear), and my friends they chose hamburgers, and she picked a T-bone steak (laughter).  We all looked at the price (laughter), and there's a little man on my shoulder who said, "That's it, she's off the list" (laughter).  So I paid for it; just swallowed and paid for it--she broke me (laughter).
Story_ID: 654702
Speaker 1: And so I said to Mrs. Klein [Clara Klein Gallup], "No, this is not gonna probably last very long."  She said, "Have you met Marva Griffin [Carter's wife, Marva Griffin Carter]?"  I said, "No."  She said, "Well, we think that she would be perfect for you, but you're gonna have to wait because she has just left for Germany in their Experiment in Living program [Experiment in International Living], but we'll give you her contact information and you can call her in the fall.  She's a student at the Boston Conservatory [Boston Conservatory of Music; Boston Conservatory at Berklee, Boston, Massachusetts]; she's from Texas."  Well, about the third Saturday of October, when Cheryl [Cheryl Susheel Bibbs] and I had severed, I called her, Marva--introduced myself, and asked her would she permit me to see her the next day, Sunday; she said, "Yes."  So I went to 54 the Fenway, in the heart of Boston [Massachusetts], to her dorm, and sat there in the lobby, and I now know that she sent a spy down to check me out (laughter), and I saw her look around the corner and then run back upstairs giggling.  Shortly thereafter, Marva appeared, and from the first moment my eyes fell on her--I can tell you what she had on--it was a two piece dress; it was orange with a white lace collar.  She had a TWA, a teeny weenie Afro, and I had already told my roommate if she has that, it won't work.  She had one, and she started talking and she flashed the biggest smile and a gold arrow went right through me; I knew I was gonna marry her.  It was love at first sight.  She started talking, and it was amazing; it was the most intelligent sounding woman I had heard in my life (laughter).  It's like, "Where have you been?"  Every step we took was confirmation that she was the one.  We took a long walk through Northeastern University's [Boston, Massachusetts] campus--the Prudential Center [Boston, Massachusetts], across the Massachusetts Bridge [Harvard Bridge] toward MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and I was thoroughly convinced; she told me that she wasn't.  In fact, at the end of the walk, she said to me, "I'm gonna have to go back to the dorm because I've got homework to do."  I found out months later she had another date (laughter).
Story_ID: 654703
Speaker 1: This is my grandmother--my maternal grandmother, Willie Mae Mullins [Willie Mae Roberts Mullins]; I called her Ma Dear.  She was my chief parent from 1941 until 1945, and she's the one who, when I was one week old, held me in her arms before the Shiloh Baptist Church--Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church congregation [First Shiloh Baptist Church] in Dawson, Georgia, and prayed out loud for me--for God to make this boy a preacher.  She probably had one of the most powerful impacts on me of anybody in my life.
Speaker 2: And this is my dear, beloved mother [Bernice Childs Johnson].  I got my energy, my drive, and my determination from my mother.  She passed, at the age of eighty-five, in 2008, and she got me ready for so much.  If I could have caught the lightning, I would have given it to her as a gift (laughter).
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: And this is my dear aunt, Eddie Kate Mays [Eddie Childs Mays], who was the one who escorted me from Dawson to Columbus, in 1945, after the death of my grandmother, and spent a month with me in Atlanta [Georgia], not knowing that she was literally, on that month long visit in Atlanta, anointing me for my stay here.
Speaker 2: And that's another shot of her; that is the image that I remember most of her as I grew up, sitting at her table on North 11th Street--317 North 11th Street, and at 26 South Oakley Avenue.  She was very much also like a mother; those are--same persons (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Those are the same (unclear)?  And this person, too?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And this is on the Hilltop [Columbus, Ohio] at 26 South Oakley.  The gentleman to the right, with his hand up to his head, is Moses Mays; that was my--Eddie Kate Mays' husband, and that's me sitting next to him, and Willie Lee Campbell [ph.] sitting next to me--my best little friend, and next to him was Uncle Joobie's [ph.] son, Marvin Mays [ph.].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: And this is Auntie Eddie Kate Mays sitting there holding her daughter's baby, Lauren [ph.].  Shirley Mays--Shirley Ann Mays there is in the red, my mother is standing behind Shirley, and that's Evelyn Sparks [ph.] and her daughter standing next to my mother.
Speaker 2: That picture was recently taken here on the Morehouse campus [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] at the president's home.  This is one of the--the diversity officer of Delta [Delta Air Lines, Inc.] here at the Atlanta airport [Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Atlanta, Georgia], and her name is not coming to me.
Speaker 1: And that is about 1952; that's Shirley Ann Mays, my aunt's daughter, and that's me, so I would have been about eleven years old there.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: And that's me, I think, on my arrival in Columbus, Ohio.  I may have been five or six, and I'm in my very first suit that my mother bought for me.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Looking very dapper.
Speaker 1: Yes (laughter).  Everybody, all my life, told me that I had a million dollar smile--keep smiling.
Speaker 2: And that was, I think, my first year in seminary [Boston University School of Theology, Boston, Massachusetts]--I came home, and that's Shirley; it was taken in Columbus, Ohio, and we were out I think Christmas shopping.
Story_ID: 654704
Speaker 1: Well, this was April 7th--or was it 1st?  What--
Speaker 2: What year was it?
Speaker 1: This year, 2010--
Speaker 2: And what's the (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) and it was, it was the induction Crown Forum in our Science and Spiritual Awareness Week here at Morehouse, and it pictures our honorees--those who were inducted into the Martin Luther King Board of Preachers, Board of Sponsors, and Collegium of Scholars, with some dignitaries posing with the president of Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia], and myself.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: That is my wife's family--her father, Dr. Marvin C. Griffin [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Marvin Griffin], and today he's eighty-seven years old, my wife's late mother [Lois King Griffin], my wife, her older--her next in line sister age wise, Gaynelle Jones [Gaynelle Griffin Jones], who's an attorney, and her younger sister, Ireeyah Griffin [Ria Griffin].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: And that is my beloved wife of forty-one years; I've known her now forty-three years, Dr. Marva Griffin Carter.  She is associate professor--a tenured associate professor in the School of Music at Georgia State University [Georgia State University School of Music, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is my father, John Henry Carter III [John Carter III], in his military uniform.
Speaker 2: That's Mrs. Madhavan [Nacha Madhavan] in San Diego, California after I conferred on her husband [M.C. Madhavan] the Gandhi King Ikeda Award [Gandhi King Ikeda Award for Peace], after a speech I delivered at San Diego State University [San Diego, California].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: And of course this is my wife's wedding picture, June 22nd, 1969, and then the picture of us there, together; it was taken after the wedding in Columbus, Ohio at the Curtis Allen Studio [J. Curtis Allen Studio], who was my high school photographer.  We went to Columbus for a big reception at Oakley Baptist Church [Oakley Full Gospel Baptist Church, Columbus, Ohio], where we got many, many gifts.
Speaker 1: And that was about a 19--no, about a 2002 visit to Tokyo, Japan, and I'm pictured there with Daisaku Ikeda, pointing to him that I can see the very top of Mount Fuji peeking through the clouds, and behind me is Dr. David--George David Miller [George Miller], who's a philosopher at Lewis University [Romeoville, Illinois] outside Chicago [Illinois], who is a co-author of my book on 'Global Ethical Options in the Tradition of Gandhi, King, and Ikeda' [ed. Lawrence Edward Carter, George David Miller, and N. Radhakrishnan].
Speaker 2: And that was one of my pictures in Columbus, and you see by how I'm dressed, that my wife--my, my mother [Bernice Childs Johnson] was very dedicated to making sure that I was one of the best dressed kids in the community.  I imagine there I may be seven years old.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  All right.
Speaker 2: And that picture was taken at the Morehouse College gala about two years ago in February, and I have on--my son [Lawrence Carter, Jr.] and I have on these Singaporean jackets that were gifts to me on my trip down there to speak, and we're posing with my wife.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Looking good.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: And this picture was my high school picture, about the eleventh grade, when I was at West High School in Columbus [West Junior and Senior High School; West High School, Columbus, Ohio] wearing one of my favorite shirts; I loved that shirt (laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  All right.
Speaker 1: And this picture was taken here in my office on the occasion when we welcomed Sri Sri Ravi Shankar from India, who was speaking in the chapel, and I wanted him to feel very comfortable so we put on costumes like he had on.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: That was about 1980.  That was a picture taken by Mr. Ho Un Chung [ph.] in his studio at the Lenox mall [Lenox Square, Atlanta, Georgia], and from that photograph, he did my official oil portrait for Morehouse, which now hangs in the King Chapel [Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel, Atlanta, Georgia], and that is the face of the oil portrait right next to it.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This picture was done by, by J. Curtis Allen in Columbus, Ohio--my high school photographer, and it depicts me in my seminary graduation robe from Boston University [Boston University School of Theology, Boston, Massachusetts] in 1968.  This was probably the proudest day of my life--that I had officially graduated from Boston University after I had been told in Columbus, by Mr. Yankum [ph.] at the Urban League, that I would never go to college because I could not read.  I didn't tell you that story.
Speaker 2: It's amazing.  [HistoryMaker] Naomi King was telling us that A.D. [Alfred Daniel Williams King] couldn't read either, and he went to Morehouse--
Story_ID: 654705
Speaker 1: I'm Denise Gines, the interviewer for The HistoryMakers.  Scott Stearns is the videographer.  This is, this is a continuation interview from July of 2010 [July 15, 2010].  Would you please state your name?
Speaker 2: Lawrence Edward Carter, Sr. [HistoryMaker Lawrence Carter].
Speaker 1: Today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is April the 18th--
Speaker 1: Two thousand (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) in 2011.
Speaker 1: And where is this interview being conducted?
Speaker 2: It's in what we call the library, or the peace room of the Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel on the campus of Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia.
Story_ID: 654706
Speaker 1: Okay, let's get started with--going back just a little bit--when we ended the last interview, you were talking about your marriage to the love of your life [Marva Griffin Carter] and, and we were going to talk about your son [Lawrence Carter, Jr.], who was not born until 1985, which you marry in 1969.  So my question was why so long before having children?
Speaker 2: Well, Denise [Denise Gines], we made the decision that we thought we could be better parents if we had finished all of our education, including the terminal degree in our fields, the Ph.D., and from those credentials be able to have jobs that we liked, enjoyed, that gave us meaning, that paid us enough to provide the kind of home and lifestyle, and future for family, so we committed ourselves to get that out of the way, and I got my doctorate [from the Boston University School of Theology, Boston, Massachusetts], finished it in 1978 and received it in '79 [1979], came here that year to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], and my wife finished hers, maybe got to the dissertation two years later [from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], and moved here from Illinois and wrote her dissertation while we were living on the Morehouse campus.
Speaker 1: Before we go--before we actually get to Morehouse, let's talk a little bit more about 1960--well, 1970--the 1970s.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: After you mar- when you marry, where are you and your wife living?
Speaker 2: Our first residence was at 700 Commonwealth Avenue, at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts].  We lived in the largest dormitory at that time in the country where there were eighteen hundred students, and I--there were five hundred I was responsible for as residential counselor in C Tower [Shields Tower], and we had a three room apartment furnished, office, I had two secretaries, and we had all the food we could eat--even had maid service.
Speaker 1: So, you stayed at Boston University for how long?
Speaker 2: From 1964 'til 1979.  I left there maybe nine days before July 1st, so that I arrived here on July 1st, 1969.  It took those nine days to drive down the East Coast, getting the blessing of many of my mentors (laughter).
Story_ID: 654707
Speaker 1: Now, you teach at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] also in 1976.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me, tell me more about that experience.  How did you get to, how did you get to Harvard?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Father Richard Tolliver [HistoryMaker Father Richard L. Tolliver], who now pastors in Chicago [Illinois], an Episcopal church [St. Edmund's Episcopal Church], was pastoring in Boston [Massachusetts], and he was what they called a clergy teaching advisor at Harvard, but for some reason, he was not able to serve either, I think, that year, and he asked me to take his place and the Harvard Corporation [President and Fellows of Harvard College] approved it; it was a corporation appointment.  And there was a Old Testament professor by the name of Hanson, and we team taught this course, orientation to ministry, in the Divinity School [Harvard Divinity School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]--I think it was Paul Hanson [Paul D. Hanson].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then you move on to Simmons College [Boston, Massachusetts], the--so you were at Harvard for a year, and then you go on to Simmons College?  Tell me about the African American studies coordination there.
Speaker 2: Yes.  My wife [Marva Griffin Carter] had been the coordinator of African American studies there, and she left in order to work on her doctorate at the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], and so the president liked us a great deal; his name was Dr. Holmes [William J. Holmes], and so he asked me if I would come in as the acting coordinator in her absence, and I said, "Yes."  I was quite surprised, and I was still working on my degree at Boston University [Boston University School of Theology, Boston, Massachusetts], and that's how I got to Simmons.
Story_ID: 654708
Speaker 1: Now, it also tells me--we're gonna talk a little bit about other activities in the community.  Tell me about other organizations that you belonged to at this time.
Speaker 2: At--
Speaker 1: While you're in Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: While I was in Boston.  Well, that's--
Speaker 1: Did you pledge?
Speaker 2: Yes, pledged Omega Psi Phi [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity] (laughter)--thought that I was gonna pledge Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity], but there was no graduate chapter for me to pledge, and my friends said that I would pledge Alpha over their dead body (laughter), 'cause all of them were Omegas, and so I went the route of Omega.  I served on a special committee to approve pharmaceuticals; it was a very sophisticated, very diverse professionally, drug committee, and the name of that is slipping me right now, and the name of the hospital we used to meet at once a month to read the write ups of the ingredients of pharmaceuticals, and then to interview the people--the officials from the drug companies who wanted us to approve this.  That was a very important eye opening experience in terms of examining the side effects of pharmaceuticals and wondering if they were humane enough to put on the market because they all had, had negative side effects.  And it really opened my eyes to the need to have fewer and fewer prescriptions to--for people to learn how to make their food their medicine (laughter).  But I also was a member of Twelfth Baptist Church [Boston, Massachusetts] at one time, and then Peoples Baptist Church [Boston, Massachusetts], and I was ordained at the Baptist Church of Brookline [sic. Baptist Church in Brookline; United Parish in Brookline, Brookline, Massachusetts], where Victor Scalise was the senior minister.
Speaker 1: What year are we talking?
Speaker 2: The ordination occurred May 1968.
Story_ID: 654709
Speaker 1: Also, you become a Mason.  Can you tell me when and why you joined that organization?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I became a Mason since I've been here in Atlanta [Georgia], and the year--
Speaker 1: That's fine.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, this was what they call, an occasional elevation.  Every year, the grandmaster can select prominent citizens to elevate, and the year that I was elevated also the mayor of Atlanta was elevated--Bill Campbell.  But I was invited to be elevated and I accepted because all during my childhood, my uncle Nena Mullins in Dawson, Georgia, who was a Mason, said, "I want you to be a Mason, I want you to be a Mason."  And though he's been long gone--died in the '50s [1950s], 1950s, I did it as much for him as for myself, but there was one other reason; because I became just a little knowledgeable--maybe even, you might say, suspicious, that the Masons were built on the pharaonic history of ancient kemet- ancient Egypt, and I had held here at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] the nation's first Nile Valley Conference, and we're about to have a big anniversary of that this fall.  And I thought that being a Mason would help me to further discover the secrets.
Story_ID: 654710
Speaker 1: Because it is such a secretive society, some people feel that it doesn't walk hand in hand with Christianity.  What do you think about--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay, so now you get to answer my question about the Masons and Christianity.
Speaker 2: I don't see a conflict between the Masonic order and the Prince Hall Masons.  You know that a good deal of biblical lore and history is built on ancient Egypt's history; it's all through the scripture.  For example, the, the names--many of the names in the Old Testament and in the New [New Testament], can be traced linguistically to antecedents that relate directly to hieroglyphs.  Hieroglyphically, Eve means serpent, fruit, and tree.  Noah means flood and drunkenness.  And so that's a dead giveaway that a lot of the Old Testament is adapted ancient Egyptian lore, and the Christian church is not really aware of that, though many of the scholars are.  And it's not talked about in churches because pastors are not quite sure the affect this would have on faith, so it takes a pretty scholarly pastor to know how to explain that, that history has a continuity, and time periods were built on the previous ones.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It's such a secretive society is, I guess, why most people think of it as something that, you know, just--they're not quite sure about.  I guess unless you're a Mason, you just really don't understand what is going on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the Masons are aware of many of the connections like, for example, the Pope's mitre--that cone shaped hat that he wears?  That is some of the vestiges romains of the pharaoh's court.  The pharaoh wore the mitre, and a lot of the pharaonic history is preserved in Roman Catholicism.
Speaker 1: Good information.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, do you--do you want me to give you one other thing?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know what the name of the pharaoh's house was?  The white house.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So, tell me about the Prince Hall Masons because that's a different--I mean there's two different factions, is that right?
Speaker 2: Well, there are a variety of Masons, or Masonic orders, but I don't think that I'm permitted to talk about that (laughter).
Speaker 1: There go the secrets again (laughter).  But it is a, a, a African American branch, is that right?
Speaker 2: I think the answer to that is yes, but I think I'd better stop right there.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, no problem.
Story_ID: 654711
Speaker 1: Okay, so in 1979, you move to Atlanta [Georgia] to come to Morehouse, is that right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And during this time, tell me how you feel about becoming--you're the first dean of the Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel [Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Chapel; Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel, Atlanta, Georgia], right--and the college curator?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me what you feel about this position.  Or how, how prepared are you to take on this challenge?
Speaker 2: Well, to be very honest with you, I believe, from the very beginning, that this is where God wanted me to be.  I believe that I was supposed to be here, and it surprised many people when I got this job--Dr. Gloster told me--and he was the seventh president of Morehouse who hired me, that there were many--maybe as many as five hundred people applied for this position, and it took them three to four years to fill it.  I delivered my candidating [sic.] sermon in December of 1977, and I did not hear from Dr. Gloster until 1979, about April or, or--yeah, about April.  We met at Sandy Ray's funeral in New York City [New York, New York].  It's where--
Speaker 1: At whose funeral?
Speaker 2: Sandy F. Ray (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I don't know who--
Speaker 2: He was the pastor, Morehouse College trustee, Morehouse alumnus, pastor of the Cornerstone Baptist Church in Brooklyn [New York], and one of the two holders of preaching chairs in the National Baptist Convention [National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.]; the other holder of the chair--preaching chair, was Gardner C. Taylor [HistoryMaker Reverend Gardner Taylor].  And I was there at his funeral because I had preached for him, but also because my wife's mother [Lois King Griffin] was raised by Sandy Ray's brother, and so I represented the family at the funeral, and I went to the home. I was quite surprised that the many Morehouse trustees, including Dr. Gloster who interviewed me, and eventually hired me, were there--and Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.], and I was just meeting people, and everybody was shocked at how many people I knew.  And it was the day after the funeral, the next day, I received the word from Thomas Kilgore, Jr., standing in front of the United Nations [United Nations Headquarters, New York, New York], that I would become the first dean of the chapel.  He said, "Did you know that Hugh Gloster was interviewing people on the sidewalk yesterday, after the funeral, about you?"  I said, "I was unaware."  He said, "I told him to cease and desist.  Congratulations, you will be the first dean."  I had preached for him in Los Angeles [California] when he stepped down from the presidency of the Progressive Convention [Progressive National Baptist Convention, Inc.], and he loved the sermon; it just so happens that was my candidating sermon at Morehouse, and he didn't know that I had been there and candidated.
Story_ID: 654712
Speaker 1: So, what were your hopes and, and desires for taking on this position as the, the first dean [of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Chapel; Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel, Atlanta, Georgia]?  What did you hope to accomplish?
Speaker 2: I wanted to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let's say your first year.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Well, I, I came here wanting the program to be a living memorial--not a museum, but a living memorial--a dynamic program honoring Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], and in witness to the prophetic Jesus.  I believe that Jesus very clearly described himself in the prophetic tradition, and I wanted to help keep alive the memory, legacy, and life of Martin Luther King, and the inspiration on this little red hill in Georgia that had produced Martin Luther King, Jr. and a host of other social engineers, and I was quite amazed when I got here to learn that that was also the same rationale that brought Benjamin Mays back to become president.  He had taught here from 1921 to 1923, and when he accepted the presidency in 1940, he said it was because he first discovered an amazing inspiration at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], and he came back to help it stay here.  Well, that's why I came, to keep the incubator alive that produced Martin Luther King and to keep his memory alive.
Story_ID: 654713
Speaker 1: Oh I know earlier we talked about the fact that you met Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], but have you worked with The King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia], or with Mrs. King?  And what is your relationship with--like with them (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I had a very good and close relationship to Coretta Scott King.  There are many stories I could tell you, but--I worked with her on her Martin Luther King, Jr. parade, and the annual celebration, served on committees to help with the organization, we brought her over here [Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Chapel; Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel, Atlanta, Georgia] any number of times to speak, and we honored her at least three times here--maybe more.  I visited her home for just private meetings with her, consultations--she and Mrs. Farris and Mrs. Farris' husband [Isaac Newton Farris, Sr.]--Mrs. Christine King Farris [HistoryMaker Christine King Farris], Martin King's only sister; they came to our home for dinner and she shared many intimate things about her life with Dr. King, and she was here for my installation, and supported my getting the job because I had worked with her in Boston [Massachusetts] when I was a head of the King center at Boston University.  She brought her board meeting to Boston, had called me one--very early one morning; I was quite surprised.  I had to wait thirty minutes on the phone before the operator put her through after she--she could not do business during the day; she had to wait 'til after midnight when people were in place, and she would make several phone calls--have the operator make several calls and alert people that she was calling collect, and wanted their permission for her to speak to them.  But then when you said, "Yes," the operator would say to you, "You will have to wait fifteen, twenty, thirty minutes--," and when they spoke to me, they said I have to wait, I think, twenty minutes.  And she said I was in line behind Ramsey Clark, the attorney general of the United States (laughter).  And so I hosted her, Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.], Mama King [Alberta Williams King], and, and Mama King selected me to be the chauffeur of she and Daddy King around Boston, and I drove them all over town.
Speaker 1: And, and what were they like?
Speaker 2: Oh (laughter) Daddy King was very humorous and very down to earth, and also very (laughter) direct.  I remember I had them to the King center on Bay State Road, and while they were there, I had Mrs. King unveil an oil portrait of Dr. King done by an artist that I didn't know that--who had been selected by one of my staff members.  And when Mrs. King pulled the cloth off the portrait above the fireplace in my office in a brownstone where the Kings said it was located on Bay State Road, they both looked up at it--Daddy King and Coretta, and Mrs. King said, "Hm," and it was a good picture--painting, but one of the hands of Dr. King was not quite right, maybe even a little deformed, in terms of how the artist showed that that was one part--aspect that he hadn't mastered.  And Daddy King was the first to speak and he said, "There's something wrong with that hand," (laughter).  I was so embarrassed I just couldn't say anything.  But there it was.
Story_ID: 654714
Speaker 1: You also filed--found a, an organization here for assistant chaplains, is that right?  I'm, I'm not sure (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You said I found or founded?
Speaker 1: Founded.
Speaker 2: For assistant chaplains?
Speaker 1: Is that correct?
Speaker 2: Now, I think you're right.  It is now coming back to me.  There was a, a history of an organization that had existed that Howard Thurman had had something to do with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Simultaneous) Hold on one second.  Let's just let this conclude.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: When Howard Thurman met me at the University of Southern California [Los Angeles, California] where he had addressed the preachers--all the pastors of the Progressive National Convention [Progressive National Baptist Convention, Inc.], I had a meeting with him afterwards to sort of get his blessing for coming here, and he's--I asked him how I should begin, and he asked me to gather around me all of the young men who were interested in ministry, who were already here, and the Christian groups that were on campus, and get them to believe in my belief with my strength until they were strong enough to believe in my belief with their strength, and it was Melvin Watson [Melvin H. Watson] who succeeded Howard Thurman at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] as the second dean of chapel [Andrew Rankin Memorial Chapel] who said to me that I should name them not deacons, but name them Martin Luther King, Jr. Chapel Assistants, and this became my Pre-seminarian Program [Martin Luther King, Jr. Chapel Assistants Pre-seminarians Program].  They were the core of this group, though not all of the young people were necessarily headed for seminary schools of theology or divinity schools.  And so that is now the longest running consistently meeting organization on campus--thirty-one years every Thursday at either 5:00 or 5:30, and we have now sent, to the leading university based divinity schools and independent seminaries, probably the largest number of young men in the country, from any college, black or white, are going to seminary.  And those young men now hold some of the leading pulpits in this country, including Otis Moss III at Trinity [Trinity United Church of Christ] in Chicago [Illinois].  I only mentioned him because The HistoryMakers are from Chicago (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, are there others that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes, Raphael Warnock [Raphael G. Warnock] at Ebenezer [Ebenezer Baptist Church].
Speaker 2: Here in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Kevin Johnson at Bright Hope Baptist Church in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Michael Waldron [Michael Waldron, Jr.] at First Corinthian Baptist [First Corinthian Baptist Church] in Harlem [New York, New York].  Some say that it might equal five hundred and--from coast to coast, so we hope to have, this coming year, our fist alumni clergy and alumni chapel assistants reunion this--next April.
Story_ID: 654715
Speaker 1: Now, this is your first year, 1979, and in Atlanta [Georgia], at this time, the missing and murdered children episode is going on here [Atlanta Missing and Murdered Children cases; Atlanta Child Murders].  Can you talk to me about that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes I can.  That was a meaningful and traumatic moment in my life, and certainly in the life of the city, at that time under the leadership of Maynard Jackson, the first African American mayor, who had campaigned that if he was elected, he'd keep the city safe.  And so one of the things that this group of chapel assistants did here [Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Chapel; Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel, Atlanta, Georgia], we decided to have an evening vesper service in honor of the parents of the twenty-one missing and murdered youth, and we really did it in a kind of innocent way to--planned it, and we decided to have a competition with all the dormitories, to see which one could bring in food--canned goods--mainly processed items.  And we put them on tables in our orchestra pit, and that--for that service we bagged these and we gave four or five bags of food to each of the families.  We had them driven here, we presented them carnations and orchids, and I preached a sermon that night titled, When Bad News Has Wings [ph.].  But there was a shock.  As I was putting my robe on to go out onto the platform for the service--and we had a swollen congregation with all those parents in place on the front row--the chairman of that program service came running into my office--Matthew Vaughn Johnson [Matthew V. Johnson, Sr.], now a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and pastoring in this city, and he said, "Dean Carter [HistoryMaker Lawrence Carter]!  Dean Carter!  You've got to come out here!"  I couldn't imagine, from the excitement in his voice, what was going on, and so I came out, and when I got to the stairs to go into the nave, I saw something that I could not have imagined, but huge cables, many of them, covering the carpet across the front of the stage--the platform--and I saw cameramen running up and down the aisles with huge cameras on their shoulders.  And I stopped one and I said, "Who are you and where are you from?"  And they said--this one particular cameraman said, "I'm from NBC and I'm from New York City [New York, New York].  We were not going to trust this to the local boys; you're gonna be seen all over the world."  And I was just stunned.  The president saw it--Dr. Gloster [Hugh Gloster]--and he was equally shocked.  But of course this was a story that had literally arrested the nation, and none of us realized that it was going to draw all of the media that came.  And it was a moving service, and a night that I shall long remember.
Story_ID: 654716
Speaker 1: You mentioned that Maynard Jackson was the mayor [of Atlanta, Georgia] during this time.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was your relationship like with him?
Speaker 2: It was very warm and cordial.  He, sometimes, would come to the chapel on Sundays and would bring his family, and he would come for special programs and he was very impressed with how we often choreographed things when we were honoring people, and he would frequently express that to me.  He had me to his home in Buckhead [Atlanta, Georgia], and (laughter) he wanted me to play--I don't know whether it was bid whist or something, but I was--I didn't know bid whist (laughter) and, of course, many trips to city hall [Atlanta City Hall, Atlanta, Georgia] when we had special guests, and that continued under his successors, and he was frequently seen on campus [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] because he was a member of the board of trustees.  Of course, he was bigger than life, especially during the Olympics [1996 Summer Olympics, Atlanta, Georgia], and I think the crowning day of my memory of him was when he was the chief host of Nelson Mandela in the city, and Nelson Mandela was only taken to two places--to the Bobby Dodd Stadium [Atlanta, Georgia] second, but first to the King Chapel [Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Chapel; Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel, Atlanta, Georgia], and in one hour they conferred thirty-eight honorary degrees on Nelson Mandela, and in this very room we unveiled his oil portrait.  This table wasn't here, and the room was absolutely packed with celebrities for that, and Maynard was absolutely thrilled, and gave Mandela the biggest motorcade procession leading the limousines I've ever seen in my life.  It was--there were so many motorcycles abreast--four or five abreast, turning onto Wellborn [Street] out here, that from a distance, before we saw the motorcycles 'cause we were lined up waiting out here in our academic regalia, the sound of them sounded like thunder, and the whole group of us fell silent as we tried to discern what the sound was, where it was coming from, and we were looking at the top of the trees in the distance on West End Avenue because they seemed to be (laughter) rustling from the rumbling, and then the motorcycles started turning the corners and just kept coming 'til almost the whole street was just full, and then the limousines occurred.  I would say Maynard showed out that day (laughter).
Speaker 1: What year was this?  Do you remember?  It's okay--if you--we'll, we'll pick it up later; we'll, we'll figure it out.  But for now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Some--somehow, it seems like 1992 [sic. 1990] but, but I'm guessing.
Story_ID: 654717
Speaker 1: Well, let's go back a little bit because we left at about 1980, '82 [1982].  So, from '82 [1982] to '85 [1985] or '86 [1986], tell me what was going on here at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], and in your life.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  These were the final years of Hugh Gloster as president, who retired in 1987, and those were really exciting years; it was the year that we got introduced to Bill Cosby whose son came to Morehouse and who became a trustee of the college, and we welcomed him here for the first time; that was a day, and the excitement was very high.  When he appeared at Morehouse for the first time, you couldn't get in here, and Dr. Gloster had recruited Cosby himself--had been to his home.  Cosby had made a commitment to give the school twenty million [dollars].  And then another exciting high point of that period was the hiring of Lamar Alford--Willie Lamar Alford [Lamar Alford], as the first dramaturge in residence.  Lamar had starred in 'Jesus Christ Superstar' [Andrew Lloyd Weber and Tim Rice] on Broadway and was working at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], and Dr. Beulah Gloster [Beulah Harold Gloster], Dr.--our president's wife, brought him to the attention of Dr. Gloster, and Dr. Gloster told me that he wanted to hire him.  I didn't know him; he told me he thought he'd be a great asset in the chapel, and so I welcomed him and he had tremendous gifts at writing plays, singing, dancing, putting on theatrical dramas, and he was in charge of all of the choreographing of the crowning of Miss Maroon and White, which became so outstanding that, given a week, we discovered he had the ability to pack the King Chapel [Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Chapel; Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel, Atlanta, Georgia] twice, and he lifted the very commodious multipurpose facility, and demonstrated its usefulness to a new level, and created an excitement among the student body that has never been achieved since.  He died prematurely, but he was absolutely brilliant.
Speaker 1: And, and you, you said Miss Maroon and White; tell me what that is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, that is the crowning of the Morehouse queen who had traditionally, I think, been a--this--I think the tradition is still--I don't think it's been broken yet--been a Spelman student.
Speaker 1: I see.  And you also mentioned Bill Cosby's son was a student here, as well, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, Ennis [Ennis Cosby]; he graduated from Morehouse.
Speaker 1: Right.  And tell me about your feelings when you heard that he had been killed.
Speaker 2: Oh, I was just devastated; we all were just devastated.  He was so young and he had, I believe, gotten his master's degree from Columbia University [New York, New York], and we thought he had so much promise and, of course, he was the only son of the Cosbys.  I think they had one other child [sic.], a daughter, but you just knew how pained the Cosbys were.  So we did here a memorial service for them that I presided over, and it was a lot of fun putting that together, to honor him and remembering that when he met people, he called everybody friend, so we passed out tee shirts with friend on the front or the back--I can't remember.  And we had a big gathering on the plaza after the service, and everybody had balloons--helium balloons, and we released them to let them go so they filled the sky with balloons, multicolored balloons, and Dr.--at the time that that happened, Dr. Massey was president--Walter Massey [HistoryMaker Walter E. Massey] who, today, is president of your Chicago art institute [School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], and Johnnetta Cole [Johnnetta B. Cole] was president of Spelman; and they both participated in the service.
Story_ID: 654718
Speaker 1: Now, in 1986, you become a part of Leadership Atlanta?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me why you chose to be a part of that.
Speaker 2: Well, I had been nominated by Dr. Gloster [Hugh Gloster], and Dr. Gloster and I both shared a very big vision for what the King Chapel [Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Chapel; Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel, Atlanta, Georgia] could be to the city and to the world.  Dr. Gloster had a kind of cathedral mentality; he had first wanted this chapel to resemble, in looks, the Duke University Chapel [Durham, North Carolina], but the faculty talked him out of it, so they had something more along a multipurpose design.  And being a part of Leadership Atlanta, Dr. Gloster thought, would help me learn the city better--who the movers and shakers--the emerging ones were, surely, and help to get the branding of the chapel better understood in the city, and how it related to the college's strategic plan and mission, and helped to tell the story of Morehouse's [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] connection to the civil and human rights nonviolent movement.  And so it worked, and I learned an awful lot that I needed to know about Atlanta [Georgia] and people who have been dear friends ever since.  I don't think I have been able to, with all of the demands on me, take it, full advantage of what that was all about since, because I've had to be both Moses and Joshua (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you remember just one life changing incident that happened during that class?  Because I know they do so many different things.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Well, I think that the discussions regarding why southwest Atlanta was not as developed as other parts of the city, I think that actually had some affect in improving what happened here when the Olympics [1996 Summer Olympics, Atlanta, Georgia] came.  Of course, you know the Olympics straddled two mayoral administrations.  Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] was mayor, and Maynard [Maynard Jackson] was mayor.  They got the Olympics under Andy, and he went out of office and Maynard came back in office and got to preside his last term which was his third term as they were--he went to Barcelona [Spain] to get the flag to bring it back and--I guess it stretched into three administrations, then even went to Campbell [Bill Campbell] administration (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, we're gonna talk more about the Olympics as it comes up.
Story_ID: 654719
Speaker 1: Back in '88 [1988], you were a delegate to the eleventh Baptist Youth World Conference--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in Scotland [Glasgow, Scotland].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that experience.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I got selected by Dr. T.J. Jimerson [sic. T.J. Jemison] who became president of the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.  I got to represent the Baptist ecumenically, on a number of committees and boards, like I was a member for six or seven years, I think seven years, of the governing board of the National Council of Churches, USA; that's the National Council of Churches of Christ [National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA].  And being in that position got me invitations to participate in the Sixth Assembly of the World Council of Churches in Vancouver, Canada as a delegate, to teach as a part of the world Baptist alliance [Baptist World Alliance] in Zagreb [Croatia], Yugoslavia, and in Scotland, and in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  Dr. Jimerson is responsible for the statue of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], and I was able to arrange all of that to everybody's great delight and shock because that's $100,000 Dr. Gloster [Hugh Gloster] said he wasn't able to raise, by making the argument to Dr. Jimerson that the statue would become a wedding band, re-inducting Martin Luther King, Jr. back into the National Baptist Convention, because he'd been expelled by J.H. Jackson [Joseph H. Jackson] along with Ralph Abernathy, and reuniting the National Baptist Convention with black higher education.  And they all bought their argument, and you see the statue.  And Dr. Gloster gave Dr. Jimerson an honorary degree, put him on the board of trustees, and we unveiled his oil portrait, which hangs here [Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Chapel; Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel, Atlanta, Georgia].
Story_ID: 654720
Speaker 1: Now you have to go back a little bit and tell me about this--the expulsion of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes.  Well, you know, there was (laughter) great jealousy on the part of J.H. Jackson [Joseph H. Jackson] who had been president of the National Baptist Convention [National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.] for about twenty-nine years, and was widely believed to be the nation's greatest preacher.  And because he was such a powerful orator, who literally had arrested the attention and the vote of all of the black Baptist pastors in the country, he didn't keep his promise that he would only serve like--something like ten years, and it got good to him so he stayed in, and no one could challenge him.  When Martin King came forth and was finally invited to address the convention--so Martin King delivered his now famous Paul's Letter to the American Churches [sic. Paul's Letter to American Christians], the convention was just overwhelmed by him, and when Jackson stood up afterwards, he said, "Let us not crown our heroes too quickly" (laughter), and threw a bucket of cold water on everybody's celebration and--because he was always afraid somebody was trying to take the presidency from him, and there were many, Gardner Taylor [HistoryMaker Reverend Gardner Taylor], among them who ran against him and lost, and it went to court and judges threw it out.  And so Jackson told the people at one of the conventions, who were registering delegates, not to receive the registration of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Ralph Abernathy.  So, when they went to pay to register, they were told they could not register, by order of the president.  So that was the expulsion.
Story_ID: 654721
Speaker 1: So now, after 1988, between '88 [1988] and 1993--well, before we go there--when we first started the interview, we were talking about your marriage and your not having children until after you and your wife [Marva Griffin Carter] received your degrees that you were looking to accomplish--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and--but in 1985 you do have a son [Lawrence Carter, Jr.].  Let's talk about him now.  Who is he, and what is he doing today?
Speaker 2: (Laugher) He is named after me, and he's a graduate of Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia].  He studied at the London institute of economics [London School of Economics and Political Science, London, England], did very well, and he has established some corporations.  He's a manager now of one of the Hyatt Place hotels on Peachtree [Street], and he's working on his M.B.A. at Strayer University, which we're very proud of, and he's excited.  And he composes music, and I think he has two corporations that he's founded.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's very talented--
Speaker 1: Okay, let's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) and we're very proud of him (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Story_ID: 654722
Speaker 1: Okay, let's go on from 1988 to 1993.  Tell me what's going on.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  This was during the presidency of Leroy Keith [Leroy Keith, Jr.] at Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia].  When Dr. Keith came, he announced that he wanted everything concerning Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] to come through his office, not through the chapel [Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Chapel; Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel, Atlanta, Georgia], and so, that gave me a little more freedom and a little more time to creatively use.  And so it was during his tenure that I went and sat--large periods of time, long hours--in the stacks at Emory University's Robert Woodruff Library [Robert W. Woodruff Library, Atlanta, Georgia], and that is when I, I worked on my books.  He commissioned me to write a, a centennial festschrift; that's a German word which means a book of articles and essays on a--dis- for a distinguished person on a significant anniversary--that's what festschrift means.  And so he commissioned me to do the festschrift for Benjamin Elijah Mays, and so I accepted it and I produced that ['Walking Integrity: Benjamin Elijah Mays Mentor to Martin Luther King, Jr.,' ed. Lawrence Carter], and it was--because it was commissioned by the college, a limited number were published with the school seal on the cover, and that became my first published volume.  And then it got a second edition; the first one was published by Scholars' Press, the second edition in paperback, slightly revised, was published by Mercer University Press [Macon, Georgia], that specializes in publishing books on famous Georgia Baptists.  And then I started my third book on 'Global Ethical Options' ['Global Ethical Options in the Tradition of Gandhi, King, and Ikeda,' ed. Lawrence Edward Carter, George David Miller, and N Radhakrishnan].  So that's how I used my time under Leroy Keith.
Speaker 1: In 1993, you're the National Endowment for Humanities [National Endowment for the Humanities] fellow?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And tell me what, what happens then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  I believe I got--I received a, a fellowship from the National Endowment of Humanities twice--one for me to study at Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island], and one to study at the University of Wisconsin at Madison [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin].  At Madison, I went there to learn more about how to handle all of the research I had accumulated on Benjamin Mays, and it was a program for documentary editing, and I got that certificate.  And at Brown University, I was there refining my work for the publication of my book on 'Global Ethical Options,' which deals with twenty ethical principles by which Martin King lived his life and led the movement; and that was most helpful.
Story_ID: 654723
Speaker 1: So, the following year you go to Brazil as a Fulbright [Fulbright-Hays Program].
Speaker 2: Yes, and there is where I was, for--I think that was, that was for a whole month, may have been a little more.  We went to Manaus [Brazil], to San Paulo [sic. Sao Paulo, Brazil], Rio De Janeiro [Brazil], Recifes [sic. Recife, Brazil], Salvador [Brazil], and we were studying the ecology of the country, and during that period, I concentrated on one of the ethical principles in my 'Global Ethical Option' ['Global Ethical Options in the Tradition of Gandhi, King, and Ikeda,' ed. Lawrence Edward Carter, George David Miller, and N. Radhakrishnan], dealing with the relationship between nature and value--working out the ethical principle.  And this was an ethical principle that I was creating that didn't exist with the group of principles that Martin King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had been exposed to at Boston University [Boston University School of Theology, Boston, Massachusetts].  I was comp- I thought that was the weak aspect of the whole system of personalistic ethics.  Personalism was the name of the philosophy that he learned at Boston University and I learned also, and it has a theological tradition, a philosophical tradition, an ethical tradition, and a psychology tradition, all revolved around personalism--it's a metaphysical perspective.  And so I wanted to mature the ethical system, and my professor, who signed my degree and signed Martin Luther King's degree--Walter George Muelder [Walter G. Muelder], approved this principle, and that's what I did in Brazil.
Speaker 1: So, tell me more about the principle.  I, I need to have a little more explanation of how you developed it or what did you develop?  What was the outcome?
Speaker 2: Well, many people are confused regarding the difference between the meaning of ethics, morality, virtue, vices, and how to write an ethical principle.  All--so there's no such thing as medical ethics, ecological ethics, business ethics--just to use those as examples.  There is the application of ethical principles in the field of medicine, in the field of business, in the field of ecology.  In order to qualify as an ethical principle, it has to be universal, it has to obligate, and it has to evaluate.  To do ethics, you must universalize, you must evaluate, and you must be obligated.  So if an ethical principle doesn't qualify by those three standards, it's not an ethical principle.  Ethical principles must transcend all disciplinary boundaries, nation state boundaries, racial boundaries, gender boundaries.  And so I evolved a principle in terms of writing; a principle always begins with, every person ought.  Ought is obligatory; it's an ethical word.  And then you proceed to make--not a prescriptive statement--you're not prescribing what people should do in any given instance, but you proceed to make a regulatory statement that doesn't tell people what to think, but it shows people how to think--how to think broadly and inclusively about ecology, about how to think; you should think consistently--about how to be inclusive, about ideal personality, ideal of community, ideal of personality.  I think there're three of those, but I think you get the idea (laughter).
Story_ID: 654724
Speaker 1: Well, also, in Brazil at that time, the, the country was going over--was in an economic downturn, I guess; reconstruction was going on.  Do you remember anything about what was going on in the country?
Speaker 2: Of--during which period?
Speaker 1: When you--in '94 [1994] when you were there as a Fulbright-Hays scholar [Fulbright-Hays Program].
Speaker 2: What was going on in Brazil or in the Unites States?
Speaker 1: The Brazil--in Brazil. Or did that affect you at all?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think I was as aware of the politics.  I remember a lot about the culture, Brazilian culture, that impressed me and inspired me, which was a very celebratory act.  We liked the music, the dance, the food, how creative the people were and how close together the rich and the poor lived.  To see the nature of the poverty there, how beautiful the Brazilian people are.  The politics--I knew that the capital was Brasilia [Brazil], I knew that it was a fairly new city, wanted to see it but we didn't get there.  I was just overwhelmed by the size, and the look, and the feel of the Amazon rainforest, the world's--I'm convinced, the world's greatest untapped drugstore.  And the mahogany trees.  If the American people saw the beauty of a mahogany tree, they'd never want to cut one down; there'd be a law passed against mahogany furniture, the trees are so magnificent; they're as majestic as the Redwoods and the Sequoias, only more beautiful.
Story_ID: 654725
Speaker 1: So what happens the next year after you finish in Brazil in '95 [1995]?  Or you can go on to '96 [1996].  You had begun to talk about the Olympics [1996 Summer Olympics] and what was going on in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Well, I remember that somewhere in there, the federal holiday for Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was signed into law by Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan], and I wanted to do something special for Martin King to get the chapel [Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Chapel; Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel, Atlanta, Georgia] spruced up; 'course, in 1984, we put this addition on the building, but I persuaded Georgia Power [Georgia Power Company] to bury all of the telephone cables that frequently marred our photographs, and to put in high pressure sodium lights to light this area up more since southwest Atlanta was known for more than its share of crime, and we didn't have the campus [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] completely enclosed yet, and many of the people from this part of the city would drift through and sometimes rob the students and beg, and so that's why I wanted the high pressure sodium lights, which they installed, and they buried the cables in preparation for the federal holiday [Martin Luther King Jr. Day] as a gift to the school, and took down unsightly wooden poles.  And then, of course, the Olympics put up the very nice imposing majestic lanterns, and broadened Westview Drive out here.  Those were some high points.  Of course, we also put up--after Leroy Keith's [Leroy Keith, Jr.] step down (audio disturbance) coming, we put up the tower--the obelisk in front, and interred the cremains of Sue Bailey Thurman and Howard Thurman, and that was very historic.  And we brought back--during that same nine months to the campus--they--Dr. Keith gave me the authority to be in charge of the entire project--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  I'm going to pause--
Speaker 2: --and I disinterred the Mays [Sadie Mays and Benjamin Mays] and brought them back--
Story_ID: 654726
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were telling me about Dr. Keith [Leroy Keith, Jr.], and he gave you permission.  Tell, tell me that story again.  We need to pick up where we left off.
Speaker 2: I went to Dr. Keith at a time when he was under a lot of criticism, and I said to him that I thought this was the appropriate time to return the Mays [Sadie Mays and Benjamin Mays] to the campus [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  It startled him, and then he looked at me and he said, "I'm putting you totally in charge of that, and don't tell anybody; just go about it."  And within a very short period of time, maybe two months, I laid the deeds on his desk, and it just so happened that the project was completed after he had left because--I did not know it at the time, but his tenure was cut short by the trustees.  And so--
Speaker 1: Where were the Mays buried?
Speaker 2: At South-View Cemetery [Atlanta, Georgia].  They were in a crypt above ground, that they had chosen, and I had to first get all of the living family members to authorize it in writing, and I achieved that--it was between nine and twelve family members.  And then I go to the cemetery and show this approval, and then I had to get a marble company in town to remove the bodies; they were taken to the Sellers Funeral Home [Sellers Brothers Funeral Home, Atlanta, Georgia], dismantled the crypt, and then rebuild it in a freshly designed plaza that I had described to the architect--Love Stanley Love [sic. Stanley, Love-Stanley, PC, Atlanta, Georgia], and they created the plaza with a seal of the college in white Georgia marble that has the sun rising from behind clouds, and they sat his crypt right on the clouds.
Speaker 1: Would that be the same people who re-did the King--the, the--what do you call it?  The crypt for, for the--Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and Coretta [Coretta Scott King]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And they built the monumental cornerstone base of the King statue, and the marble plaza around the Thurman obelisk as well.  The Robert-Shields Company [Roberts-Shields Memorial Company, Atlanta, Georgia].
Story_ID: 654727
Speaker 1: Now, talking about the, The King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia] and Ebenezer Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia].  You were the one in charge of finding a location for the new edifice, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Joe Roberts [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Joseph L. Roberts], the senior minister, had put me on the, the building committee.  He had had two heart attacks, and about three fizzles--groundbreaking fizzles at different locations, and the church couldn't agree because they didn't wanna move too far away from Auburn Avenue.  So I had a vision on a Sunday afternoon, after he had told me I was gonna be on the committee--the meeting was Tuesday night, and I walked out of the church and saw the whole church; it appeared in my vision right across the street, and I had just been looking at a model of it in the church, and when I walked out, my mind just put it across the street, and I was so startled when I saw it, and I knew what the reasons were--Mrs. King [Coretta Scott King] and Joe Roberts, the senior pastor in the church--why they didn't pick that site; they never thought they could get it.  They didn't wanna be criticized by the local community for taking the community center from the community.  They--I mean they had been criticized by the community people that Ebenezer and The King Center got everything.  So I had to go to a service at three o'clock, and lo and behold, Maynard Jackson, the mayor of the city, was seated right next to me at the service, and I thought, oh, Lord, this is gonna happen.  I told him what I--my vision was, and he said, "If you're serious, have the trustees send me a letter saying they want that property for that purpose."  And he said, "It'll take a long time to untie the legal knots, but I'll make it happen."  He said, "The city owns the building, and the federal government owns the land."  "But," he says, "I think I can do it."  It all happened, and it shocked the pastor and the church.  They gave me four standing ovations (laughter).
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other people on the committee?  Were there other people--
Speaker 2: Yes, on the--Judge Glenda Hatchett [HistoryMaker Glenda Hatchett], and the chair of the committee was Senator Leroy Johnson, the first black senator in the Georgia legislature [Georgia General Assembly] since Reconstruction.
Speaker 1: So y'all made it happen, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  And also Terry--Carl Terry was on that committee, and of course Joe Roberts.
Speaker 1: And so tell me about the first day--the first service.  Were you there?
Speaker 2: The first service--
Speaker 1: At Ebenezer, at the new edifice.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes!  It was elec- matter of fact, I was there for the ground breaking, and for that first service when Joe Roberts and the other pastors wheeled, in wheelchairs, the senior citizens--elderly of the church who couldn't--who were in nursing homes; brought them in in wheelchairs, a whole caravan of wheelchairs, so they could be there for the occasion, and it was a royal full house, and everybody was just as happy as could be (laughter).
Speaker 1: And that, that gave way to the old sanctuary being remodeled.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And of course you know it's on the national register of historic monuments [National Register of Historic Places] of the interior department [U.S. Department of the Interior], and they've just gone into it a few days ago.
Speaker 1: And, and what year was this?  Do you remember what year?  Ninety-nine [1999] is when they had the first service, so your search for the land and getting everything done (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I think that was about--it was probably '97 [1997]; I think '96 [1996] or '7 [1997], right in there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 654728
Speaker 1: All right, so now--you talked a little bit about 'Walking Integrity' ['Walking Integrity: Benjamin Elijah Mays Mentor to Martin Luther King, Jr.,' ed. Lawrence Carter], the book that you edited, and a, a biography.  Talk to me a little bit more about this because this is when--we're, we're in 1998 now--is when this, this book is published, is that right?
Speaker 2: 'Walking Integrity' by the Scholars' Press.  I believe that's about correct.  This book was a celebration of the centennial of Dr. Mays' [Benjamin Mays] birth.  He was born 1894, and that's definitely when he was born, but now the publication date I'm not absolutely certain of.  And I had sat in Dr. Mays' basement of his home in the early '80s [1980s], long hours, all day long, annotating his Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier] articles--over a thousand five hundred of them, and had learned a great deal about him, and the more I learned, the more inspired I was, and thought that he deserved a festschrift; in fact, I was very surprised that at his funeral, they did not print one line of biography on his funeral program, not one line, and I was just horrified.  And that was one of the big things that motivated me to do something for him, and since then, another festschrift has been published by Dr. Samuel DuBois Cook [HistoryMaker Samuel DuBois Cook]--came out just last year, but--fact, I need to call him (laughter) for lunch.
Story_ID: 654729
Speaker 1: So, what happens next--in 1999?  I wanna talk about the, the Gandhi, King, Ikeda Institute (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes um-hm, 1999 was the Columbine High School [Columbine, Colorado] shooting, and that brought many calls into the chapel [Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Chapel; Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel, Atlanta, Georgia] asking what we were gonna do, and I decided to claim Gandhian nonviolence philosophy and merge that with Kingian nonviolent philosophy, and to do that not just for Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], Georgia, America, but for the world.  And I decided, since we were approaching the close of the century and the millennium, to have a big celebration which I called Millennium Sunday, and we dedicated the Gandhi Institute of Reconciliation; we've since added King's name [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and Ikeda's [Daisaku Ikeda].  It's an interfaith institute--the Morehouse Interfaith Institute for Global Ethics and Reconciliation [sic. Gandhi, King, Ikeda Institute for Global Ethics and Reconciliation].  And on that day, we gave the first Gandhi, King, Ikeda Community Builders Prize to Prince Hassan [El Hassan bin Talal] of Jordan, and unveiled a big plaque with the litany on it dedicating the institute, and unveiled the bust as a gift from the people of India, of Mahatma Gandhi and his wife Kasturba [Kasturba Gandhi], and the two upper busts--one done in New Delhi [India], the other in Calcutta [India], and shipped here--rest on a marble table given by about sixty-five thousand Indians--Americans here in Atlanta [Georgia], and it was a major day, and we unveiled--Mrs. King [Coretta Scott King] unveiled a huge plaque outside the chapel with the I Have A Dream speech engraved on it, as identified by 100 American professors from coast to coast as the greatest speech of the 20th century, beating out all of the American presidents.  So that's how we ended sort of documenting the 20th century, and we did this with the help of the Prince Hall Masons, who paid for the plaque--twenty-two thousand dollars--and with the Soka Gakkai International, and we've partnered with them ever since.  They're the largest Buddhist spiritual community in the world, headed by a, founded in Japan, and now it exists in 192 countries and territories with 12 million members, and we have partnered to do peace work, so the exhibit that we--a two thousand square foot exhibit on the three men, on a legacy of peace, has been to six continents and been viewed by over a million people; it parallels their lives.  Not saying that their lives were equal in their achievement, but these men were certainly equal in their dedication with what they have done, and Ikeda has probably done more than anybody, other than Mrs. King, to institutionalize the nonviolent legacy of Dr. King.  And I made a little qualification because Mrs. King deserved the Nobel Peace Prize and she did not get it, but she deserved it because I consider her the greatest lobbyist in American history; just a, a little more successful than Mary McLeod Bethune, who I thought is the second greatest lobbyist in American history.  But Mrs. King is chiefly responsible for getting the legislation proposed by Congressman John Conyers [HistoryMaker John Conyers, Jr.] of Michigan, asking for the federal holiday [Martin Luther King Jr. Day]--asking for the now Dr. King--and four days after Dr. King was buried, Mrs. King started lobbying [U.S.] Congress for the passage of that legislation.  And, of course, you knew it passed both houses and President Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] signed it, and then it had to be ratified by every state in the union; Arizona was last.  Coretta Scott King has made it possible that once a year, everybody thinks about her husband, his philosophy, his legacy, his amazing life, and nonviolence.  And that's what the Nobel Peace Prize is als- all about.
Story_ID: 654730
Speaker 1: Well, well tell me how were you first aware about Ikeda [Daisaku Ikeda]?
Speaker 2: It was in the, the late '80s [1980s] that the Soka Gakkai International, that bases their spirituality around emphasis on culture, education and peace, brought to the chapel [Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Chapel; Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel, Atlanta, Georgia] a huge, magnificent, colorful musical; that's when I first met them.  They swept in quietly, and they swept out, and I didn't see them again until I announced in the newspapers the founding of the Gandhi Institute for Reconciliation [Gandhi, King, Ikeda Institute for Global Ethics and Reconciliation], and one of their members, a professor at Clark Atlanta [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], Ann Fields Ford, Dr. Ann Fields Ford, saw the announcement in the paper and called me and said, "Is this true, that you're about to do peace work?"  I said, "Yes."  She said, "May I come to see you?"  She walked in here in twelve minutes, saw this room--she was stunned.  She said, "This is the biggest secret in the AU Center [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia]."  She stayed and talked, and wanted to know if I wanted to know more about the SGI, I said, "Yes," more about Dr. Ikeda, I said, "Yes," and she arranged for me to receive his books from local people, and then a delegation came to see me from as far away as Tokyo [Japan], Los Angeles [California], Chicago [Illinois], New York [New York], Miami [Florida], and Atlanta [Georgia], and I knew they were serious.  The more I talked, the more they talked, and the more we heard each other, the more we saw we had a lot in common, and that's when we decided to develop--I came up with the idea of the exhibit, and they said, "We specialize in exhibits.  What should it look like?"  And I told them, and they made it happen, and the rest is history.  So I've gone all over the world talking about peace.  I've been to thirty-seven countries and--helping people acquire a vocabulary for peace, and that it's more than cotton candy (laughter), and it's more than a security.
Speaker 1: So, this was right at the end of 1999, is that right?
Speaker 2: That's when it all started, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's when it started?
Speaker 2: --and it culminated in 2000 and 2001.  I shouldn't say, culminated; it burst--it happened when the millennium dawned in the beginning of the century.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in 2000--
Speaker 2: And then we did it in April--
Speaker 1: Oh, in April, okay.
Speaker 2: --of 2000.
Speaker 1: Two thousand [2000].  And the award [Gandhi, King, Ikeda Community Builders Prize] was given also during that time, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me more about why the recipient received the prize.  Why was he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We--I wanted to make a radical statement.  Of course you know the trouble that Americans have had after the World Trade towers [World Trade Center, New York, New York] collapsed, and how many in this country demonized Islam and started talking as if all Muslims were terrorists.  And so--I never believed that, especially when the very word Islam means peace.  And Gandhi [Mahatma Gandhi] said that the roots of nonviolence could be found in the world's great religions, including Islam.  So we deliberately chose a Jordanian Muslim as the first recipient to be honored by a historically black college [HBCU].  We wanted to send a message so we found someone in their--the Muslim spiritual community who was a champion of peace and non-violence.
Speaker 1: Where--tell me again, who was the recipient?
Speaker 2: Prince Hassan [El Hassan bin Talal] of Jordan; he was at that time--I know he was, he was--yeah, he was the crown prince of Jordan at that time.
Speaker 1: And so how did you become aware of his work?
Speaker 2: It was brought to me by Dr. Walter Massey [HistoryMaker Walter E. Massey], our president.  He called me and told me that someone that he had met or knew had--was very close to Prince Hassan, and knew of his peace work, and had some knowledge of what I was doing.  But it was Dr. Massey, Walter Massey--Walter Eugene Massey, a Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] grad--class of '58 [1958], who thought that I should know about him, and so he brought him to my attention, I looked into his background, and I liked what I saw; and the rest is history.
Story_ID: 654731
Speaker 1: You, you talked about the World Trade Centers [sic. World Trade Center, New York, New York], but let's go back and talk about that day [September 11, 2001], and tell me what you were feeling during that time--what were your thoughts?
Speaker 2: 'Course everybody knows where they were, and I was getting out of my car when a student ran up to me and said, "Something awful has happened; come, and we have the televisions in the chapel."  That alone startled me 'cause we didn't have TVs in the chapel; they had brought them into the chapel.  So I came in and I saw the pictures on the screen and my heart just absolutely dropped.  I, I just never imagined anything equivalent to a military assault on American soil, and I knew, knowing this country as I do, that we were in for a period of the demonizing of Islam; I knew that immediately.  And I had worked so much in this city to improve interfaith relations, so much so that I'm referred to by many pastors as, the most ecumenical pastor in the city, and that's quite something when you consider that there are over six thousand Christian churches in Atlanta [Georgia], and that doesn't even count the non-Christian spiritual communities.  So, it's a good thing, and I knew that I would have to do more, a kind of an uphill battle, to continue that because there were many people who wanted to hate Islam.  And so that emboldened me to do more peace work, and to travel more, and to speak more, and I think it's all been good--the spreading of abroad.  I concluded, when I came, that in order to achieve Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] dream, that the programming here had to be international, interfaith, interracial, cross cultural.  And the trustees accepted my recommendation, changed the name of the chapel from Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Chapel to the Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel [Atlanta, Georgia].
Story_ID: 654732
Speaker 1: So tell me--well, actually, I just wanna go back just a little bit because I know that you had a relationship with [HistoryMaker] Andrew Young, and you said you--we talked about Maynard Jackson, but we didn't talk much about Andrew Young.  Did you have a relationship with him as well (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: And we had started--I know we're going a little bit backwards, but we didn't complete our talk about the Olympics [1996 Summer Olympics] here in Atlanta [Georgia]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and Andrew Young, as you talked about before, was instrumental in that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So talk to me about that before we go forward--back into--to 2000.
Speaker 2: I actually had a closer relationship to Andrew Young than I did to Maynard, and it has many parts.  I actually worked in, in Andrew Young's first run to be mayor; I worked in his campaign, and then also Andy Young helped us host the first and only visit to this college [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and to this country of Cheikh Anta Diop from Senegal.  You know he's the great Senegalese scholar who discovered the method for measuring melanin in the skin of mummies, and he proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that all of the pharaohs of the first twelve dynasties of the second union, after Menes, all the pharaohs were Negroid.  And that was--when that discovery was announced, that's when Anwar Sadat, the president of Egypt, shut down all access to the mummies.  So he made only one trip in his life to the United States, and we gave him an honorary degree--it was for our Nile Valley Conference, which came in two parts because he got in trouble over the Atlantic [Atlantic Ocean].  The plane had to go back for the real Nile Valley Conference, and so we brought him separately a little while later, and Andy Young helped us host him, and we--he invited us to his home to help plan it, and dinner for him, and we--he hosted him in his office, and the president of Delta [Delta Air Lines, Inc.], Ron Allen [Ronald W. Allen]--he and his wife flew Cheikh Anta Diop from Paris [France] to Atlanta on the very first flight, the maiden flight of Delta, and flew him Medallion class, and when he arrived in this city, oh, my god; there was a throng in the Atlanta airport [William B. Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport; Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Atlanta, Georgia] and the people just shouted, they jumped up and down, they went wild, shouting, "We did it!  We did it!  We did it!"  And I was stunned when we got back to the college as the news spread across the country that he had landed here.  The scholars in universities across the country were demanding that we share him, and especially New York City [New York, New York]; they were angry as could be at us (laughter), that we had actually got him here before they got him in New York City.  And as fate would have it, when he returned, and I got to take him to D.C. [Washington, D.C.] to NAFEO [National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education], the meeting of the--all the black college presidents, when the whole visit was over--lasted about a week--he went to Senegal and he died suddenly.  He never got to return to this country, but they named the university after him in Senegal [Cheikh Anta Diop University, Dakar, Senegal].  But he was a multi-genius.  In order to get his doctorate officially, from the Sorbonne [University of Paris] in Paris [France], he had to write four Ph.D. dissertations because the first three were rejected because they were so radical, because he was proving that Egypt was populated from the South and not from the North--not from Europe, not from the Mediterranean, not from the Middle East.  In other words, it was populated--founded--by black Africans, and the European scholars did not want to hear that.  But every dissertation that he wrote, he published.  And finally, the fourth one became his magnum opus, and they accepted it.  This was an assault on scholastic racism.
Story_ID: 654733
Speaker 1: Did we ever talk about what your dissertation was about?
Speaker 2: No, but that's another subject.  But very simply, I realized at one point, sitting in church, that the preaching of the minister was a time far too often for the preacher to do his own therapy on the congregation by projecting his need values when the people could not talk back.  Put very simply, my wife [Marva Griffin Carter] and I would go to church--first year we were married, there was a particular church in Boston [Massachusetts], and we would go feeling very good, but when we left church, we didn't feel so good; we didn't feel inspired, we felt like we had been hit over the head.  So we decided to pay attention--to see at what point during the service this was happening, and we observed that it happened during the sermon time--when the minister literally scolded the people and bawled the congregation out, and got a lot of things off his chest.  So I decided to do a dissertation using Abraham Maslow as my theorist; I now know I should have used Peter A. Bertocci, philosopher of religion of Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts], but I used Maslow, his hierarchy of needs, as categories into which to place sermons--aspects of sermons. I chose two preachers, one white, one black--William Augustus Jones [William A. Jones] in Brooklyn [New York], and Otis A. Maxfield [Otis Maxfield] in Columbus, Ohio.  After having read their manuscripts, I listened to their cassette recordings to determine at what point, when, and how--what the wording was when they projected their needs, and I discovered that it centered around pronouns, and I discovered that there was more negativity in sermons than I realized.  And I had selected Maslow because of his theory of self-actualization--developing your full potential; so that's why I chose these two preachers who were favorites of mine 'cause I thought they were such actualizers.  And so that was what my dissertation was about, and it was an exploratory dissertation.  I never published anything from it because both men were alive for so long, but Jones has passed, and I think Maxfield is still living; and I just didn't wanna do that.
Story_ID: 654734
Speaker 1: Let's talk about some of the highlights of your speaking engagements all over the world.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me one that you enjoyed the most (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the one that shocked me the most was a chance to give two addresses on the same day in Madison Square Garden [New York, New York].  But the highest honor, I think, though--the one that I will long remember and never--and always prize, is the invitation by Daisaku Ikeda to deliver the founding address for Soka University of America in Orange County, California [Aliso Viejo, California], an event that was so amazing that it made the front page of The New York Times in color. Soka University, it was founded on a pedagogy--a curriculum of peace.  I don't think there've been many universities founded on such a pedagogy; it was founded by the Buddhists, and a tremendous amount of money that was almost startling, collected from the 12 million Buddhists from all over the world, went into the construction.  If you don't know this university, you should go on the Internet and look at it.  It is built for the ages--it is beautiful, almost beyond words.  It is avant-garde.  The student body has no more than five hundred; the endowment, the endowment will very shortly--and I mean in a matter of months--surpass a billion dollars, and I serve now on the board of trustees.  The university was founded in 2001, and my address that I delivered was titled, Growing Up into Democracy's Crown.  And they published it.  That may very well be the zenith, the apex, of my speaking.  And it's fascinating that the invitation came from the Buddhists, not from my beloved Christian church.
Story_ID: 654735
Speaker 1: But the chance to serve seven years on the governing board of the National Council of Churches of Christ [National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA] and to go to Russia, to Moscow, and several other cities in Russia, was also another high point.
Speaker 2: With the council of parliament of the world--in world religions [Parliament of the World's Religions] in Spain and Rome [Italy]?
Speaker 1: It was--yes.  I went to Barcelona [Spain], and that was eye opening because I was amazed to discover that the council of the Parliament of World Religions is literally run by the Muslims, the Buddhists, the Hindus, the Sikhs--with very little Christian influence.  I think I was probably one of the most prominent Christians present, and the reason I know it was because when I appeared just as a delegate from here; when they found out that I was there, they put me on program to address the entire eight thousand delegation.  In the exhibit hall, there was no Christian exhibit--Christian books, no picture of Jesus; I was amazed.  And it disturbed me that Christians are not significantly trained; they're clergy.  In knowing how from a Christian perspective to engage the other faith traditions, and so I decided to do something about that here, so we invite--this Sunday, Easter, is probably going to be the nation's first interfaith Resurrection Sunday. And people said, "What is that?  Easter is so Christian, exclusively Christian, so how can you make it interfaith?"  I said, "It's very easy."  I said, "The real meaning of Easter is resurrection, and resurrection means that nothing--neither height, nor depth, nor sickness, nor death can separate you from the love of God, the life of God, the peace of God, the harmony of God, because every religion in the world acknowledges that in God we live, move, and have our being.  And even if you don't believe as the Buddhists do in a deity, it means--resurrection means you cannot be separated from the mystic law, from the vibratory energy in the universe that sustains all."  And when the Buddhists heard that, they shouted.  I had everybody else.  And even if you're an atheist, all of that still applies to the non-believers; they just don't give it a name.  So, Easter is about the day death died, that there is no separation from you and whatever you call the infinite.
Speaker 2: So that's how it, it can be inclusive of, of everyone (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: But I have to ask is, is this--not calling Easter service, is it called (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's being called, Interfaith Resurrection Assembly.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But as a Christian, can you just address Easter for me, since we're talking about Easter?  Because it's not biblical is it?
Speaker 1: You mean the word?  The word (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The word, Easter, the word, Easter, yes.
Speaker 1: You know, the word I will have to research, because I just recently, Saturday, asked someone, "Why are people so hesitant to use the word Easter anymore?  They prefer the word resurrection."  And the person couldn't tell me.  But now that you've asked me this, you have further conscientious-tized me that there is something there, so I will research very quickly, on the Internet, the origin of the word Easter, and which I have a suspicion may be connected to Easter--to rabbits--Easter bunnies.
Story_ID: 654736
Speaker 1: All right, so we came through up until 2011, but let's just go back a little bit (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter)--
Speaker 1: --(cough) excuse me, and go back to 2005, and talk a little bit about Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] and the impact that it had on the city and, and the school, if any.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Many blacks fell silent because we absolutely were horrified at the slowness of the response of the government.  George Bush [President George Walker Bush] was president.  George W. Bush was in Texas, and he had to fly on Air Force One back to D.C. [Washington, D.C.], and in my own mind, I knew he was going to--just out of humanitarian interest, I knew that there would be some deviation so that he could at least fly over and get a view, but he went right back to D.C.  And I remember the criticism.  Many people thought that Kanye West was right, that he didn't care anything about black people.  Their response was so slow--Secretary Rice [Condoleezza Rice], Vice President Cheney [Dick Cheney]--that you didn't--with the outcry coming up from all the people who were affected by this crisis, it was a tremendous contrast with the way the Japanese people responded.  The resilience, their stoicism, their humility, no looting, their patience.  Of course, they come from a different spirituality, different culture--but is why I preached on Sunday from the title--for Palm Sunday, Job, Jesus, Jerusalem, and Japan.  And I put all this together around the common theme of suffering, and how there's more coming.  But I think that's one of the big things that helped to popularize Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] and made his win so triumphant, because his humanity and his moral vision for the world seemed to be so strong.  I felt sorry for President Bush.  I didn't agree with what he did in Iraq, but I really think he is basically a decent man, but I think that the--what Dwight Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] warned us about regarding the military industrial complex, and the alliance they have formed with corporations, make the way government and our presidents have used war very suspect.  War makes a small group of people very wealthy, and you know the whole weapons of mass destruction were really the weapons of mass distraction.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But you know that on our board of trustees is Spike Lee at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], and you know he did a documentary ['When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts'] on this, which aired here, and so there's a poster over there (gesture), right against the wall, that he autographed of that event, and I think--Spike Lee, who I hope to honor here at Morehouse soon, by unveiling his oil portrait to be hung in the King Chapel [Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel, Atlanta, Georgia], is perhaps one of the great secular prophets, and that's quite significant considering that Joe Lowery [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Joseph Lowery] may be the last of the great Christian prophets at least speaking now, and he'd share that honor, I think, with John Shelby Spong--Bishop John Shelby Spong.  And I think, to some extent, the late Peter John Gomes [Peter J. Gomes] would fit in that category.
Story_ID: 654737
Speaker 1: You talk about honoring other people, and you've been honored with a number of awards.  Tell me--well, I guess they're all special to you, but what is a highlight of an award that you received?
Speaker 2: That's hard; I have received quite a few.  I think that I have been most surprised to find my name in marble on four cornerstones at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], put there by three separate presidents--Hugh Morris Gloster [Hugh Gloster], by Leroy Keith [Leroy Keith, Jr.], and Wiley Perdue.  I didn't ask for it but they did, and it's quite something, considering I'm not a Morehouse man.  I often say to people, when they ask what year did I finish Morehouse, I'll say, "Dr. Mays [Benjamin Mays] and I did not go to Morehouse" (laughter).  But that is certainly a high honor.  Another was the award I received from the Soka Gakkai [Soka Gakkai International]; the (Unclear) Award was a very distinguished honor from Dr. Ikeda [Daisaku Ikeda], and then they really took me away when they told me that it--I think it had only been given out three times; I was the third recipient, and the second recipient was Mikhail Gorbachev (laughter).
Speaker 1: Impressive.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And locally, I have to mention the Trumpet Award (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I was about to say, yeah; that did come to mind--and the Trumpet Award.  That really surprised me.  I think that [HistoryMaker] Xernona Clayton is a very special lady in the world, and I have wanted to honor her here by unveiling her oil portrait (laughter), but she has been very bashful about that.  But maybe it'll happen.  But she certainly has been a very special person; in fact, she has wondered if I have forgotten them because every time they have a Trumpet Awards, I'm out of town (laughter), and so I've got to surprise her and show up.
Story_ID: 654738
Speaker 1: Is there anything that we have not talked about that you would like to talk about?
Speaker 2: My wife.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Marva Griffin Carter is the best thing that has happened to me.  Her name, Marva, means the miracle; and I guess it would take that to be married to me (laughter), but I prayed for her, and had almost given up--almost despaired, until on a blind date I found her and, and seeing her for the first time, even with--I told my roommate that if she had a TWA, a teeny weenie Afro, it wouldn't work--she had one, and the moment I saw her, it was like cupid shot a golden arrow through my heart.  I knew she was the one; I knew I would marry her.  She didn't know, but I knew, and she's had a brilliant career--a graduate of the Boston Conservatory [Boston Conservatory of Music; Boston Conservatory at Berklee, Boston, Massachusetts], the New England Conservatory [New England Conservatory of Music, Boston, Massachusetts], Boston University School of Fine and Applied Arts [Boston University College of Fine Arts, Boston, Massachusetts], and the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], the Ph.D.--the first African American to get that degree in musicology from that university.  She broke into an old white boys' club, and then to become the professor and chairman of the department at Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia], and to go from there to being professor and director--assistant director, or associate; I don't remember which, of the School of Music at Georgia State University [Georgia State University School of Music, Atlanta, Georgia].  And before that, to serve for ten years as the organist at Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta [Georgia], and coordinator of all the church music--and the mother of my son [Lawrence Carter, Jr.].  And now she's published a book published by Oxford University Press [Oxford, England], the definitive biography on Will Marion Cook, ['Swing Along: The Musical Life of Will Marion Cook,' Marva Griffin Carter] the mentor of Duke Ellington, and a host of others.  She is remarkable for her stick to it-iveness, her discipline, her writing ability, her speed reading, and how she manages money and can keep the whole house stable.  And she's the mother of our most beautiful son--it was a perfect pregnancy.  And she's a very peaceful lady, and I have never met anyone who, on meeting her, did not like her.  And that's how she's gotten also all of her jobs.  She's walked into people's presence and they've said, "You're the one."

Speaker 1: Tell me, what do you want to accomplish that you have not yet?
Speaker 2: I want to write the history of this chapel [Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel, Atlanta, Georgia].  It's amazing to me that it's beginning to look like I'm approaching the end.  It has gone so fast, and it has been a challenge but it's been a lotta fun.  And I wanna finish the history before the 150th anniversary of the college [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] in 2017, and I'd like to write my autobiography before I lose my memory (laughter), and I'd like to be able to pay down considerably, if not pay off our house; I'm a long ways from it, so my son [Lawrence Carter, Jr.] won't inherit that burden, but I'd like to give him--you know, turn the deed over to him, and hope he is strong enough to be able to raise his family there is my dream.
Story_ID: 654740
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: My chapel assistants--that I tried to prepare them in the prophetic learned ministry tradition of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  Since the age of fifteen, I have prayed the longest that I would send many young people into the Christian ministry.  I've always had a passion to strengthen the leadership of the Christian church for the new age, and I think I've done a lot in that direction.  Many of you will think that I have succeeded, but I did it with pennies.  I now have a $2,050,000 grant from Lilly [Lilly Endowment, Inc.] , that I wish I'd had earlier, and so we're working--see can we increase that so the six people staff that I had--see, for twenty-nine years, I did this all with a clerk-typist, but now I have six staff members, and they've come in the nick of time and they wonder how in the world I did this by myself; I wonder too, but maybe that's why I'm so tired now.  But that's--I want to be remembered for keeping Martin Luther King's legacy alive.  I committed myself on the night that he died, in prayer, and with my fiance [Carter's wife, Marva Griffin Carter] then sitting on the back pew of Marsh Chapel at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] the night of April 4th, 1968.  I prayed out loud, "Lord, help me to do something significant for Martin Luther King, Jr. before I close my eyes."  Well, I was given two opportunities, one at Boston University and here [Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel, Atlanta, Georgia].  And putting up the statue of him, the only statue of Dr. King, I raised money for it in the State of Georgia, that's one of the high points.  Bringing the Mays [Sadie Mays and Benjamin Mays] back to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and putting up the obelisk outside, which is probably the tallest tomb in the southeastern United States to honor the Thurmans [Sue Bailey Thurman and Howard Thurman] and inter them there--those are the accents of my work, leaving the compass and the map on the kitchen table for becoming moral cosmopolitans.
Story_ID: 654741
Speaker 1: Because this will be seen by future generations years and years and years from now, if you had to send a message to the future generations, what would it be?
Speaker 2: It would probably be what I just said.  For Martin King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], the goal was integration.  I would like to say that the whole planet must work toward his vision of a world house so that we understand and get beyond internationalism, which is simply a kind of acknowledgement that they're sovereign states--nation states, and that we move between these states.  We must get beyond the in between-ity concept of living, and understand that to become a moral cosmopolitan is that you don't put a straitjacket on your morality, and you must have the same loving compassion for the children in Bangladesh, the Gaza Strip, Peking, China [Beijing, China], Moscow [Russia], as you have for the children of your neighbors next door; that's what Martin King was all about when he said, "Injustice anywhere--anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere--across all boundaries."  So we must transcend all of the boundaries and get out of the race box, the religion box, the nation box, the gender box, the language box, the diet box, the apparel box, and recognize the humanity of everybody, even of our oppressors.  When we get there, the human species will have evolved greatly, for in exemplifying the humanity that I think Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, Moses--a host of others--are all about.  It's really just a kind of Hindu, Buddhist, Islamic, Judeo-Christian love.
Speaker 1: Is there anything else?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: You sure?
Speaker 2: It's very important for the clergy to work toward being servant, scholar leaders.  What I mean by that is that your servanthood should be informed by scholarship.  Before you act, reflect; reflection, action, and that way, nobody will be hurt.  We, we need more than the military for conflict resolution between nation states; there are other methods.  Nonviolence must be seriously studied.  And one final word to the church, to the Christian church--don't let homosexuality divide any further the already broken body of Christ.
Story_ID: 654742
Speaker 1: With that said, I just cannot go without asking your opinion about some of the things that have gone--not only in Atlanta [Georgia], but because you live here in Atlanta, some of the thing that are going on in some of the churches.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me how you're feeling about that.
Speaker 2: Well, I have come down on the side of one perspective of Jesus, and I think on this issue there are two perspectives from Jesus.  The closest Jesus comes to sanctioning capital punishment are through the words; it would be better that a person had not been born than to have that person harm the hair on the head of a little child.  He says it would be better for that person to have a millstone draped around their neck and that they be drowned in the midst of the sea.  That's pretty strong.  But also I read in scripture, in the New Testament, in the gospels, that we should forgive seven times seventy.  And I don't think that is a mathematical absolutism, but I think that it is a metaphorical way of saying infinitely.  And that is a side I come down on.  Of course we can always say we wish it had not happened, but it's very important for us to engage in nonjudgmental compassion, you know.  We say in Christian church, except for the grace of God there go I.  We don't know all that is going on in people's lives that have brought them to these particular points--crisis points.  They could be experiential, and they could be developmental.  But we don't know what other people have had to put up with in themselves, or bear with in others.  And many of us have been very lucky by how we were raised and by the parents that we had, but there are many who were victims, I think Malcolm X was one.  But you don't have to behave like a victim, and you can overcome, and I think Malcolm X did, and I think that is why he's a hero of so many.  And I think what has been published in his most recent biography by [HistoryMaker] Manning Marable ['Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention'] about him, is going to heal a lot of people.  But everybody needs forgiveness.  If we can learn not to see intentionality in other people's mistakes, then the way is open for us to practice forgiveness more.  And so there is still a great need for pastors who've already done their own homework and who have a broad and deep understanding of human nature and understand that it is developing, evolving.  You see, if you don't understand the stages that people have to go through developmentally, and you don't understand the possible crises that can happen when things don't go well, then, as a pastor, you won't know how to program in church to help people in a full guidance ministry, transverse the stages of life from the cradle to the grave.
Story_ID: 654743
Speaker 1: Do you think that the fact that many of these churches are becoming megachurches that the pastor cannot actually pastor?  I mean they have so many different pastors because not like days gone by where you had a pastor, and you can go and talk to your pastor and be counseled by the pastor.  Megachurches have changed the dynamics of so many things.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you think that because there are so many megachurches that this is the reasoning for that non-process that the pastors go through?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that you're right when you suggest that it's impossible to pastor a megachurch, at least for one person to do that, whether that person is a bishop or not.  It's safe for me to say it's very hard for one person to pastor three hundred people (laughter).  People are very needy; they often turn first to the pastor in the community for help in times of trouble, crises, and there's an argument that can be made and is made by the pastors and priests who are celibate that they have married the church because having your own family takes time away from what you can give to the parish, to the community, to the church, because just being fresh, creative, original, and relevant every Sunday for fifty-two Sundays when you don't have visitors--getting a homily together is a challenge, and unfortunately, many pastors have hobby horse topics.  And so the goal of a megachurch, and then the unbelievable situation that is created of having a church on both sides of town where you helicopter between them and in another city are watching the wonderful ministry of Joel Osteen every Sunday on TV addressing thirty-five thousand in Houston [Texas], as effective a speaker and a wonderful motivator that he is, it's, it's, it's crazy to suggest that he's pastoring that many people (laughter), you know.  He's appearing before that many people and talking to them.  So, a pastor must be a celebrator of change, a negotiator of structure, a facilitator of meaning, and you must help people deal with the past, the present the future, so you must be a guarantor of continuity.  You must help people see how all these things relate.  And so church is a very serious business, but unfortunately, in most places, it's just a Sunday service--Sunday school, choir practice, prayer meeting, and a meeting of the board of trustees and the deacons (laughter).  And they're not affirmatoriums, they're not laboratories, they're not education centers--that's why Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]--during his time, they said that they let the--they said the Sunday school hour in the Christian church on Sunday is the greatest hour of the sharing of Christian ignorance (laughter) 'cause the teachers don't get prepared--they don't go to school for this; few pastors even teach their church--congregations church history.  They don't know the history of the development of the Bible.  Most of them don't know that the King James--the King James Version of the Bible?  Most church members don't know--never been told that King James was a bona fide, certified homosexual.  We know that.  No apologies (laughter).  I've often speculated that one of the reasons he killed the people who translated the version that bears his name was because he didn't like the way he--what they said about gays in the Bible (laughter); that's my interpretation.  He had them killed, I'm told--all the people who translated the Bible.  But you know, they say the truth will set you free, but before it does, it will (laughter) irritate you (laughter).

Speaker 1: Any last words?
Speaker 2: I've been delighted to be a part of this wonderful experience of The HistoryMakers, and this is going to be, I think, an everlasting project for The HistoryMakers because we just keep on coming, and there are people maybe that you should interview who could talk about some of the people who you've missed (laughter) before you were founded.  But thank you so very much for considering me, and now my grandchildren--I told my son [Lawrence Carter, Jr.] this morning that I was having this experience of induction, and I'll tell him this evening that now his children can go to The HistoryMakers to learn about gramps.
Speaker 1: Well, thank you so much for taking the time to share.  I mean all of this is just so amazing and, and your life was amazing, and your wife [Marva Griffin Carter], and your father-in-law [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Marvin Griffin] (laughter)--a family of HistoryMakers.  We thank you so very much for your time.
Speaker 2: Well, thank you, and I hope you have safe travels.
