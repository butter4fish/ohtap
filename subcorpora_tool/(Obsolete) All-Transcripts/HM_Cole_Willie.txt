Speaker 1: Time of year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of year is probably the winter.

Speaker 1: And saying or phrase?
Speaker 2: I don't use colloquialisms.  I don't have sayings or phrases.  I have original ones--

Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) maybe those would be better.  Well I told my son, "It doesn't matter when you get on, get on the bus as long as you know when to get off."
Story_ID: 665466
Speaker 1: So I want to g- talk about your family and we'll go, both sides of your family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Let's start with your father, if you tell me his name, when and where he was born and about him and his family?
Speaker 2: Okay, my father's name is Willie James Cole [Willie Cole, Sr.].  He was born Navassa, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Navassa--
Speaker 2: Navassa--
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: N-A-V-A-S-A [sic.], Navassa, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: And what's that near?
Speaker 2: Navassa is a little town near Wilmington, North Carolina, that's the big city.  That's probably about a half hour drive.
Speaker 1: And when was he born?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  He's eighty-five years old now, so that's a clue.
Speaker 1: So probably 19--
Speaker 2: Nineteen thirty [1930]--
Speaker 1: --thirty-one [1931].
Speaker 2: Okay, yes.
Speaker 1: And what day, do you know that?
Speaker 2: Oh, December 10th, I know his day for sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what, what's his work?
Speaker 2: Right now his work is retirement, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And as a young man?
Speaker 2: --when he was a younger man he worked as a, a maintenance mechanic for American Cyanamid [American Cyanamid Company], which is a chemical company in New Jersey.  He was the guy who would fix all the machines there.
Speaker 1: How long did he stay in Navassa?
Speaker 2: I think he left there when he was probably a teenager.
Speaker 1: Tell me about his growing up?  Does he have siblings?
Speaker 2: Yes, my dad has three brothers that I know of and two sisters.
Speaker 1: And where does he fall in the birth order?
Speaker 2: He's the eldest.
Speaker 1: And what--and who were his parents?  What did he, they do?
Speaker 2: Oh man, you're talking about the '30s [1930s] now.  I think that my grandfather, whose name was Janis [Janis Cole], but we all called him Big Eye [ph.], I think that he was just a carpenter and a farmer and my grandmother, Maryanna [Mary Willis Cole], she played the piano in church on Sunday, but other than that she was just a housewife.
Speaker 1: And the '30s [1930s] in Navassa, North Carolina, did they talk about what life was like in, in their town at that time?
Speaker 2: Not really, but my relationship with them wasn't as strong as I would like it to have been because my parents divorced when I was maybe twelve years old, so from the age of twelve up until probably the age of thirty I didn't travel down south, yeah.  Prior to that I would go there every 4th of July and have family time.
Speaker 1: And when you went there where--is Navassa a, an agricultural town?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you could call it that (laughter).  I laugh because I call it a shit town.
Speaker 1: Because?
Speaker 2: Because the industry there was a manure factory.
Speaker 1: Literally?
Speaker 2: Yes and the story is--my cousin [Eulis A. Willis] is currently the mayor of Navassa and he wrote a book called 'Navassa and Its People' [sic. 'Navassa: The Town and Its People, 1735-1991'].  In that book he describes a, a, a factory that migrated from Cuba to the Carolinas because it was an island off the coast of Cuba where the bat manure was the greatest you know, for growing.
Speaker 1: Bat manure?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, there's another word for it, guano maybe, so they would collect that and they brought that to the Carolinas, so I always wondered did they bring it--their slaves with them, so according to my cousin, they brought their slaves with them.
Speaker 1: And what's your cousin's name?
Speaker 2: What is his name, that's a good question.  I can't think of his name (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, you'll, you'll (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I told you about my--
Speaker 1: But he's the mayor now?
Speaker 2: He's the mayor of Navassa, yeah.
Speaker 1: So it clearly you have family (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I only met him twice, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you have, you have family that stayed there?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  My father is, my father and his siblings left, but their children are still there.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: They moved back.
Speaker 1: --you said your father left when he was a teenager--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so that would have been in the '40s [1940s].
Speaker 2: Yes, in the '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: And was it leaving as many in the Great Migration, for work?
Speaker 2: Also Navassa is, there's nothing in Navassa, at that time dirt roads, ditches, outhouses, so most people wanted to leave, most young people, teenagers wanted to leave, so I think that's what lead to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And so the people who were there, the parents and grandparents--were, were there plantations there, what, what was the--?
Speaker 2: No farms, my great-grandfather had huge farm there when I was a kid, and.
Speaker 1: And what was his name?
Speaker 2: That's a good question, I just knew him as grandpa, but he was old my whole life, first of all (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and he spoke another language, which I don't know what it was, but I think it was probably his father or him who came from Cuba.  I guess it would have been his father who came from Cuba to the Carolinas.
Speaker 1: Was it because there was a large Cuban population because of the, the  (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The factory, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --that, and so you can trace your family likely to Cuba?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And that would be what, two generations, three generations back?
Speaker 2: That would be not my grandfather, possibly my great-grandfather, but definitely my great-great-grandfather.
Story_ID: 665467
Speaker 1: What about tracing them to Africans and or to slavery?
Speaker 2: Well of course we know there is a link there, but I don't know, I always think that they may be Ibo from Nigeria just based on the way that we look.  The Ibo people I know now always think I'm Ibo, so I would trace it to that.
Speaker 1: But you can't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, I can't--
Speaker 1: --directly, right?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah I can't--
Speaker 1: Occasionally--
Speaker 2: --I can't give you my African address (laughter).
Speaker 1: --(laughter) occasionally people know, so--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nowadays and it's a goal of mine to do the ancestry.com, or something to find out, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, but the Cuba part is, is interesting.  Did, do you know anything about the Cuban population that built up in Navassa [North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't.
Speaker 1: And now are there Cuban family members?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I don't know because these would have been black Cubans--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --back in those days, so their current descendants would all speak English most likely.
Speaker 1: And your, your, your--do you know where your father [Willie Cole, Sr.] went to school when he was in Navassa?
Speaker 2: I don't, but I know that he dropped out in the third grade, yeah.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Probably to work on his grandfather's farm.
Speaker 1: Did he ever get more education?
Speaker 2: Well you know, he was a smart man and he was good with his hands so he at American Cyanamid [American Cyanamid Company] they taught him blueprint reading because he could fix things without reading the blueprints, but they wanted him to have the blueprint reading as one of his skills, so he did that and he actually, but that wasn't his first job from the Carolinas.  When I was born he was working at a beer factory in Newark [New Jersey].  It might have been Budweiser [Anheuser-Busch Companies], but wherever it was there were a lot of German employees so he learned some German during those years.
Speaker 1: When he moved from Navassa it was to Newark?
Speaker 2: No I think he moved to Connecticut first because he had an uncle in Connecticut near Bridgeport.
Speaker 1: And what did he do there?
Speaker 2: I don't know, he might--
Speaker 1: And did, was he the first to come, he's the eldest?
Speaker 2: Well my grandfather's [Janis Cole] brothers were here also 'cause I have an uncle who lives, who--well he's passed but he used to live in New York and in Massachusetts.
Speaker 1: But they all came east?
Speaker 2: They all came east, yes and I think that was just the times.  A lot of people did.
Speaker 1: From that area, that part of the country (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 665468
Speaker 1: Okay, so please tell me about your mother, her name, when and where she was born?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mom's name is--her maiden name is Jacqueline Eva Mae [Jacqueline Epps Cole], which she hates, last name is Epps, E-P-P-S and she was born in Georgia.  I think she was born in Macon, Georgia.
Speaker 1: When's her birthday?
Speaker 2: February 13th, 1937.
Speaker 1: It's almost here.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we're having a big party for her soon.
Speaker 1: And she--Macon, Georgia, is, where is she--are there other siblings, and where is she in the birth order of her family?
Speaker 2: She is the eldest.  She has one sister [Sharon Epps].
Speaker 1: So she comes from a small family?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And her parents?
Speaker 2: She never knew her dad, but her mom was Christine Epps [Christine Groce Epps].
Speaker 1: So she never knew him, did he die early or he just wasn't around?
Speaker 2: He just wasn't around.
Speaker 1: So what did her mom do for work?
Speaker 2: Her mom, again I wish I knew all the answers to all your questions, but I'll tell you what I know (laughter) okay.  So my grandmother, my mom's mom, worked at American Cyanamid [American Cyanamid Company] also, but she worked in the chemistry lab there.  She worked her way up from being a janitor to being the first black woman to work in the chemical lab there.
Speaker 1: This is your--
Speaker 2: My mother's mom.
Speaker 1: --your mother's mother, so from a janitor to what?
Speaker 2: To, to a chemist.
Speaker 1: Wow. And was she taught there, or she went to a school?
Speaker 2: I, I think she was taught on the job, but she did go to high school and she went to secretarial school after that.
Speaker 1: So, that, that's, so that's in Newark [New Jersey], right?
Speaker 2: No, American Cyanamid used to be in Bound Brook, New Jersey, but it's been closed down for maybe twenty years because of pollution and contamination, I mean it was a horror, it was sci fi-ish [science fiction] so they closed it down.
Speaker 1: So we'll get into more detail on that in a moment, let's go back to your--Christine Epps--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 1: --that's your grandmother--
Speaker 2: Yes, my grandmother, right.
Speaker 1: How far can you trace her family back?
Speaker 2: Well, I haven't done a trace myself, but I have been told by another cousin who did the, he did one of these online things, that my mother's family entered the U.S. through Mexico.  Now I know Mexico is not the most, most well known port of entry for slavery, but it was a port of entry, so my mother's family came through that direction.
Speaker 1: And through the slave trade--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to, to your cousin's knowledge?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What about your grandfather's family, do you know anything about them?
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was your mother's work?
Speaker 2: My mother had all kinds of odd jobs.  There was a point in our lives where my sister [Debra Cole (ph.)] and I went with her to clean offices in downtown Newark, but she retired as the night supervisor in the mailbox division of the U.S. Post Office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service], but between those two jobs she, she worked as a bank teller, she worked as a cashier, she worked at Remco toy factory [Remco Toys, Inc.; Remco Industries, Inc.], she worked at Burroughs Corporation, so a lot of different jobs.
Speaker 1: And how much education did she receive?
Speaker 2: High school graduate, but the post office sent her back to school I guess maybe management or something to learn some intricacies necessary for her promotion.
Speaker 1: When did her family move from Macon, Georgia north?
Speaker 2: Well my mom never lived in Macon, Georgia, she was just born there because her, it may have been her great-grandmother was, was dying so my grandmother traveled down there to visit her grandmother in the hospital and my mom was born that same week.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your, your Grandmother Christine--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --was already (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, she lived in New Jersey already.
Speaker 1: Okay, she was already working at American--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, American Cyanamid.
Speaker 1: --Cyanamid.  When did she move north?
Speaker 2: I don't know, definitely before I was born and her father, my great-grandfather [Charles Groce] was in the North my whole life too and he was in the North at the time of Paul Robeson at Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey], so he'd been here for a while.
Speaker 1: Your grandfather--?
Speaker 2: My great-grandfather.
Speaker 1: Your great-grandfather?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And did he know Robeson?
Speaker 2: Well he was a minister, so definitely Robeson's dad [William Drew Robeson].  They all went to the same church in Princeton, between Princeton and I guess around the Somerset County in New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Did he tell you stories about him?
Speaker 2: He has never told me any stories about Paul Robeson or Paul Robeson's father, but he's referred to them in conversation, yeah.
Speaker 1: So your, your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now that I think about it, because he, he's told me that he met Albert Einstein on the campus of Princeton, so whatever year that would have been when Einstein was at Princeton, he's in New Jersey during that time, before that he was in Florida.
Story_ID: 665469
Speaker 1: And what was your [maternal] great-grandfather [Charles Groce] doing at Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: Well these are the mysteries of the family, you know how old folks can be (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) He, he didn't say?
Speaker 2: Well he gave me the impression that he was a student there, but you know, I never really paid attention until I got older and he had lots of certificates and degrees on his office wall, but I never really read one closely, but he said that he went, he went to school at Princeton.
Speaker 1: And what was his work?
Speaker 2: He was a minister.
Speaker 1: Okay, in, in what faith?
Speaker 2: Baptist.
Speaker 1: And did, did you and your family go to his church?
Speaker 2: When I was younger we went to his church, as I got older we went there for, for Thanksgiving I guess, or a couple of holidays.
Speaker 1: Where was his church?
Speaker 2: His first church was in Bound Brook, New Jersey, that's where my mom [Jacqueline Epps Cole] lived after she was born in Georgia and that's the church that he built himself.
Speaker 1: The physical building?
Speaker 2: Yes and his next church was in Jersey City, New Jersey, New Bethel Baptist Church and then his next church was in Florida, he returned to Florida as he got older.
Speaker 1: Where did your--Bound Brook is where you said your grandmother [Christine Groce Epps] lived--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and, and her father and your--
Speaker 2: Yes and my mom lived there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and your--
Speaker 2: That's where my parents met as well.
Speaker 1: Right, they met in Bound Brook?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 665470
Speaker 1: How did they meet?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I'm laughing because I have these racy stories I'm not going to tell you. But my [maternal] grandmother lived in a house not far from Ruberoid [Ruberoid Company], which is a factory like maybe a block away and she was also a socialite, so she would give big gambling parties and all the young men would come and she'd charge them and serve them food.
Speaker 1: This is your grandmother--
Speaker 2: My grandmother.
Speaker 1: --Christine [Christine Groce Epps]?
Speaker 2: And my mom [Jacqueline Epps Cole] was her daughter, so that's how she met my dad [Willie Cole, Sr.].
Speaker 1: He came to one the parties?
Speaker 2: One of those parties, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and how long before they got married?
Speaker 2: That I don't know (laughter), but I would imagine three years maybe, but I'm not really sure.
Speaker 1: Well I was going to ask you how your grandmother managed because she wasn't, you know, her husband--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --wasn't there?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That's tough to be a single mom taking care of her kids (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yeah. Well she had a pretty good job, you know, I don't know at what point she got her promotions, but she had a pretty good job.
Speaker 1: Because she went from janitor to being a chemist [at American Cyanamid Company]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 665471
Speaker 1: Tell me about the, this place American Cyanamid [American Cyanamid Company]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, American Cyanamid they make paints, I mean that's, I think that's their main product and I actually worked there for a while too maybe for about six months.
Speaker 1: Was that the main industry in that town?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, Ruberoid [Ruberoid Company] was in Bound, was in, on the border of Bound Brook [New Jersey] and South Bound Brook [New Jersey] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what's Ruberoid again?
Speaker 2: --that's another factory that's in town there where my dad [Willie Cole, Sr.] worked for a little while, but if you get on the highway and go down a little further it's American Cyanamid and I forget the exact town it's in, but somewhere between Somerville [New Jersey] and Bound Brook 'cause that was our stumping ground.
Speaker 1: Can you spell Cyanamid just so I'm clear?
Speaker 2: C-Y-A- C-Y and the color C-Y-A-N-I-M-A-D [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay, got it.
Speaker 2: So they made, they made dyes and paint, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you said that it was kind of like a sci fi [science fiction] movie, how so?
Speaker 2: Well if you look at like some of the older sci fi movies where they are showing laboratories and there's steam and smoke everywhere, it was like that, but it was the size of the city. So when I worked there I was a janitor, but my contract said that because this is a chemical plant if you feel uncertain or unsafe by cleaning up anything that spills you can just say no, so I said no to everything (laughter).  So I spent six months there in a, in a sweeping cart just driving around, driving around the whole thing, touching nothing, but seeing everything.  I would park and draw pictures and things like that, so, so--
Speaker 1: And you touched nothing because it felt unsafe?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't want to clean up chemicals you know, I mean I worked there because I didn't have any money and my dad said, "I can get you a job at the plant." Probably all the black dads said that back in those days (laughter), so I did it for six months.
Speaker 1: Cleaning up nothing?
Speaker 2: Cleaning up nothing.
Speaker 1: It took them six months to figure that out?
Speaker 2: It took them six months to fire me, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, I would sweep you know, I would sweep like one of the main warehouses, but trailers would come in where stuff had spilled in the trailers and they would call me to clean them up and I refused to do it.
Speaker 1: How old were you then?
Speaker 2: That might have been 1979 so, twenty-four.
Speaker 1: You were an adult?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah I was a struggling artist (laughter).
Speaker 1: So this was the job that you had to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --to make a little money?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 665472
Speaker 1: You're born in January in Somerville--
Speaker 2: Somerville, New Jersey (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) this is where your family had moved to?
Speaker 2: Well, my, Somerset county hospital [Somerset Hospital; Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset] was in Somerville, but they lived in Bound Brook [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's near, they're nearby?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and my [maternal] great-grandfather [Charles Groce] lived in, well at that time it was Franklin Township [New Jersey], which pretty much now it's Rutgers University [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey], so that our whole family was in that part of New Jersey.
Speaker 1: And that, and you have a sister, what, what's your birth order?
Speaker 2: My sister's older.
Speaker 1: Okay, and was she born there also?
Speaker 2: She was born also in Somerville.
Speaker 1: And what's her name?
Speaker 2: Her name is Debra, Debra Elaine Cole [Debra Cole (ph.)].
Speaker 1: When you think back on your childhood what is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory is my dad holding me as like, less than a year old, over a hog pen and hogs running towards me and my mom [Jacqueline Epps Cole] saying, "Willie Cole [Willie Cole, Sr.], put my baby down, put my baby down."  It blows their minds that I remember that, but it was such a traumatic experience for me as an infant I never forgot that.
Speaker 1: Where were you?
Speaker 2: In Navassa [North Carolina] on the farm.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That was frightening.
Speaker 2: Yeah, even for a baby (laughter).
Story_ID: 665473
Speaker 1: In your, in your growing up when you think of memories of your childhood and growing up in New Jersey--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --or Navassa [North Carolina], wherever these memories come--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what are the sights, sounds and smells that you remember as a child?
Speaker 2: Sights, sounds and smells, I grew up in a lot of different places.  In Somerville [New Jersey], the sound of lawnmowers because I heard this sound like--I'll just backtrack a bit, so my family moved to Newark [New Jersey] when I was three years old, but I spent every weekend and every summer in Somerville at my [maternal] grandmother's [Christine Groce Epps] house and the sound that I heard all the time was the sound of the lawnmowers, but as a kid I never knew what that was.  When I moved here I realized that's the sound of lawnmowers, so all those years later (laughter)--
Speaker 1: You just heard the sound?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I thought it was like an animal or something, but it was lawnmowers so the sound, that's the sound of Somerville.  In Newark--you said sight, sound and smell, see I was, I was such an introverted kid, all of my sights, sounds and smells probably were in my room, so (laughter), so the smell would, I guess my mom's [Jacqueline Epps Cole] cooking.  She has always been a great cook, but I also made a lot of model cars as a kid, so I always had a tube of rubber cement or glue in my room, so those are the big smells in my life as a kid.  The sounds, probably a lot of sounds of profanity and arguing--
Speaker 1: In your house--?
Speaker 2: In the whole community, there was always somebody fighting or bottles breaking, so that's childhood in Newark in the projects [Stella Wright Homes].
Story_ID: 665474
Speaker 1: Where, which projects were you living in?
Speaker 2: I lived in I think it was called the Stella Wright projects [Stella Wright Homes, Newark, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: And so this is in, in what years are you living there?
Speaker 2: I moved there in 1963.
Speaker 1: So by the time your family is living in the projects there's, they've changed a bit I guess, because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, they were brand new then.
Speaker 1: Were they?
Speaker 2: But they were given to people who didn't have anything or no money, so had, I feel they had no respect for the property at all; so we moved there in '63 [1963] and we saw this beautiful high rise luxury building but within six months it was a pretty rough neighborhood, yeah.
Speaker 1: I've talked to a number of people who moved into the projects--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --some a little bit before you--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --having the same image--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --this is beautiful, it's so great that this was built and we can afford it and--
Speaker 2: Yes, but it was built in a low income community and offered to low income people and before the projects were there, there were people there who were noisy and violent and drunkards, so suddenly they were all in the same building (laughter), so that's why it wasn't really high rise luxury living after all.
Speaker 1: But that was the promise?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well that was the, that was the bait I would say that, yes.
Speaker 1: The bait, better put--
Speaker 2: Because the, you know, you've probably heard about the, these things like the Prince Albert plan [sic. King Alfred Plan] and the Moynihan Report ['The Negro Family: The Case for National Action,' Daniel Patrick Moynihan] and all those things, so those, those buildings (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So tell, tell, tell me about them?
Speaker 2: --had windows that were this big (demonstrates), so if there was a fire you couldn't get out you know and also thirteen floors and apartments from A to H on every floor and only two elevators, so it was really just a trap, you know.  Almost like a prison with a hole in it with little windows, a hole.
Speaker 1: And did it feel unsafe?
Speaker 2: It didn't feel unsafe to a little kid because they could run up the steps and down the steps and my friends were like one floor down, so it was, it was great for little kids at the time.  I wasn't allowed to play outside a lot.  We had a playground attached to our--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --to our building and I could play there sometime, but, but again I didn't go out much anyway you know, I was, I was probably the strangest kid in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Strange how?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't use profanity.  I remember one day my friends challenged me to curse and I said every curse word I could like in one sentence (makes sounds) and that was it.  So I felt cool that I had said all that, but you know--
Speaker 1: And, and why did you choose not to (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and, and also because I was an artist kid.
Speaker 1: Why did you choose not to curse?
Speaker 2: Because I was taught not to use profanity, yeah.
Speaker 1: Your parents [Jacqueline Epps Cole and Willie Cole, Sr.]--
Story_ID: 665475
Speaker 1: And you were an artist kid, you knew early on that you were an artist?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my family said I was an artist since about the age of three.  My mom [Jacqueline Epps Cole] found me in the kitchen tracing the comic, the Sunday comic paper, the Sunday comic strips from the newspaper and since then they said I was an artist.
Speaker 1: And they supported that?
Speaker 2: They supported that, yes, my dad [Willie Cole, Sr.] because he worked in this big factory [American Cyanamid Company], he would bring home paper, like when he stayed in blueprint reading he would bring home the grid paper and pencils, blue pencils, you know, black pencils and my, at different points my life had different modes of support, but that was a good one and then my [maternal] grandmother, she married when I was in high school [Arts High School, Newark, New Jersey] and her husband's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Christine [Christine Groce Epps]?
Speaker 2: Yes, her husband's ex-wife had been an artist so I inherited all of her supplies, so that was good too.
Story_ID: 665476
Speaker 1: Your family you said from, from three they know, they knew that you were going to be an artist and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --they're providing you with supplies as they can?
Speaker 2: Right and classes as well.
Speaker 1: From, from, how young are you taking classes?
Speaker 2: Well, every summer in Somerville [New Jersey] they had art classes in the park and I would go to that, so probably started doing that at the age of six up to the age of twelve in the summers there.  And the Newark Museum [Newark, New Jersey] offered classes so I moved in the projects [Stella Wright Homes, Newark, New Jersey] when I was eight, so probably from the age of eight up until high school I went to the Newark Museum classes and then in Newark's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what, what were you studying, from six on up, what kinds of--
Speaker 2: At the Newark Museum I was doing mostly puppet stuff, making puppets and papier mache.  The Somerville art in the park for kids in the summer was mostly craft stuff, you know making little, little things, little insects, bottles of sand, things like that, but the Newark School of Fine and Industrial Arts [Newark, New Jersey], which is the country's oldest school of the arts, they have a high school and a college.  I went to the high school there [Arts High School, Newark, New Jersey], but before I was in high school I went to classes at the college on Saturday for drawing and painting.
Speaker 1: So, could (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I probably did that from the age of ten to the age of maybe fifteen.
Story_ID: 665477
Speaker 1: As you're, you're growing up, where are you going to regular school?  Where do you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: Well it's a long list. First I went to Robert Treat School [Robert Treat Academy Charter School] which is in Newark [New Jersey], which then I think maybe in the '70s [1970s] became Marcus Garvey School [Newark, New Jersey] and I think it's closed down now, so I went there from kindergarten to third grade and then I went to Quitman Street School [Quitman Street Community School, Newark, New Jersey], right across the street from the projects I lived in [Stella Wright Homes].  I went there from the fourth grade to the sixth grade, but my parents divorced in the sixth grade so I moved in with my [maternal] grandmother [Christine Groce Epps] in Somerville [New Jersey] and I went to Somer- Somerville Elementary School [Ridgewood, New Jersey] there.  And then my mom [Jacqueline Epps Cole] got an apartment in Plainfield [New Jersey], so I went to school in Plainfield, so in the sixth grade I went to three different schools.
Speaker 1: Okay, how did you manage?
Speaker 2: Well I, I successfully graduated so I guess I managed okay, but you know my parents were trying it out, so although we made that full circle we ended up coming back to Newark, parents getting back together (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So they, they got back together?
Speaker 2: They got back together and I graduated from Quitman Street School, the same sixth grade school where I started.
Story_ID: 665478
Speaker 1: The--you know divorce is always tough, you're in the fourth grade, (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --how did you and your sister [Debra Cole (ph.)] manage during that time?
Speaker 2: (Pause) We managed okay, but you know, I hesitate because I grew up in a house of domestic violence so that was pretty much the main event, that's what occupied our thoughts.  We were interested in protecting our mom [Jacqueline Epps Cole] you know, that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: As children in, in a house like that, how, what were you doing?  How, how, what did you do in your efforts as a child to protect your mom because you know it shows itself in many different ways?
Speaker 2: Right, well, see now I don't know how much of this should be said, but it wasn't like, it wasn't total madness, it was just, it would last that long (gesture), so our job was, was mostly to say stop.
Speaker 1: Which is a courageous thing--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to do as a child.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you feel heard?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes I did.
Speaker 1: So when your parents split was that a relief?
Speaker 2: (Pause) No because you know, what, what I'm thinking I guess is to say what I'm thinking, is that in my family if you are somebody's partner they're in your life forever, so even though my parents divorced you know, my dad [Willie Cole, Sr.] was still in my life and he's still my mom's best friend even 'til this day, so I couldn't say it was a, a relief, I could say it was a struggle because of my mom, with my dad he took care of everything, so suddenly she had to take care of two kids and that's why we lived in so many different places until she got a good job and then she got an apartment and all that stuff.
Speaker 1: And throughout this you are still being supported in your creative pursuits which--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --some of which costs, right?
Speaker 2: Yes and you know I have heard that kids who are artists use that to, to feel comfortable and to resolve issues, so I mean I could always bring a drawing into a room and say, "Look," and then suddenly everybody was like, "Oh that's wonderful."  Everything was suddenly peaceable you know and I could also escape when I needed to escape because as a kid I, my dad built, well he helped me build a light box because I wanted to be a cartoonist as a little kid, so I had full series of cartoons and characters, story lines and everything; so that was my escape into that world, the world that I created through my own characters.
Story_ID: 665479
Speaker 1: You mention that you were sort of the odd kid being the artist. You're in Newark [New Jersey] yet one school is across the street from the projects [Stella Wright Homes], you're moving around to different schools.  How are, what is your social life like at school?
Speaker 2: I didn't have a big social life.  I would say at Quitman Street School [Quitman Street Community School, Newark, New Jersey] I had maybe two friends, Fred Thomas [ph.] and Tommy Levine [ph.].  I remember their names and the three of us were into building car models so that was our, our connection.
Speaker 1: And this was an integrated school, Tommy Levine, is he Jewish?
Speaker 2: No, no, he's not Jewish he's, no, Tommy Levine is not Jewish.
Speaker 1: These are black students?
Speaker 2: Yes, they're--
Speaker 1: Were any of these schools integrated?
Speaker 2: In Newark the school was most- almost 100 percent black and Puerto Rican.  In Somerville [New Jersey] it was an integrated school [Somerville Elementary School, Ridgewood, New Jersey] and in Plainfield [New Jersey] it was an integrated school 'cause Bound Brook [New Jersey], Bound Brook is north and north Bound Brook, I mean South Bound Brook [New Jersey] and Bound Brook, Bound Brook is white then there's a river [Raritan River] and then there's South Bound Brook.
Speaker 1: If there's no train tracks there's water (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right (laughter).
Story_ID: 665480
Speaker 1: When you were thirteen 1967, is when the riots occurred in Newark [New Jersey] do you remember that?
Speaker 2: In 1967 I was in Los Angeles, California, so I watched the riots on TV.
Speaker 1: Really, what were you doing there?
Speaker 2: Visiting family, so I missed the riots.
Speaker 1: But you saw it, this is, this is, where--
Speaker 2: I saw it but I didn't really see a lot of it.  I don't know if that was deliberate or not, but I didn't really see, I mean they wanted to give my sister [Debra Cole (ph.)] and I a great vacation so we didn't spend a lot of time watching TV.
Speaker 1: So who were you with?
Speaker 2: I was with my mother's sister [Sharon Epps] and her husband.
Speaker 1: And your, was your mother [Jacqueline Epps Cole] with you as well?
Speaker 2: No, she was in Newark.
Speaker 1: So, so she had sent the two of you on vacation?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How long were you there?
Speaker 2: For the whole summer, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you missed--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --all of that incendiary--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --situation?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But when you came back where were you living?  Could you see the--
Speaker 2: We were living in the projects [Stella Wright Homes, Newark, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: --the devastation.
Speaker 2: No, 'cause our neighborhood was all these tall buildings, there was nothing else there except those tall buildings from the neighborhood house where we would go play sometimes and the Quitman Street School [Quitman Street Community School, Newark, New Jersey] and then some little mom and pop stores in the community, but the riot didn't take place in the neighborhoods where you lived, it took place downtown.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So I guess I, I'm sure I had to, I couldn't, I could have not, I could not have seen the evidence of it downtown, but I don't really recall how I felt when I saw it at that time, but I--'cause when we were at Robert Treat School [Robert Treat Academy Charter School, Newark, New Jersey] we moved to the projects before the school year ended, so my sister and I would walk from Robert Treat School to the projects every day, so I knew there were a bunch of stores on Springfield Avenue and Bergen Street, et cetera, et cetera, so I know those stores were gone, windows were broken and all that kind of stuff, some were boarded up.
Story_ID: 665481
Speaker 1: Where you aware of Amiri Baraka at the time, when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: I was aware of Amiri Baraka once I got to high school because I went to Arts High School [Newark, New Jersey]--
Speaker 1: Right, Newark's--that's what it was called, Arts High School?
Speaker 2: The high school was Arts High School; the college was Newark School of Fine and Industrial Arts [Newark, New Jersey].  Baraka had a center right down the street called the Committee for Unified Newark.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I had to pass there every day and he would do programs in the community, but at my school.  He would have programs come to our school, so I was very aware of him.
Speaker 1: What kinds of programs?
Speaker 2: Just mostly music programs, African drummers and dancers, things like that.
Speaker 1: He was a leader in the Black Arts Movement, obviously.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah definitely in Newark [New Jersey], I, I would say that he brought blackness to Newark.
Speaker 1: At, at a time when you know, in the, in the '60s [1960s] black consciousness is--
Speaker 2: Bubbling--
Speaker 1: --and you know what I--this is the, the beginnings of the Afro and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and you know, a, a greater boldness.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, no Baraka was very present in Newark and he was so present in Newark that people who were not part of his organization would say habari gani, you know, we were all saying habari gani.  We were all suddenly wearing dashikis and that was all through Baraka.
Speaker 1: Would, did you ever get involved in his organization?
Speaker 2: I didn't join the organization. Actually I wished I had.  I wanted to be a boot dancer, but I couldn't do after school stuff, you know.  My mom [Jacqueline Epps Cole] was at work so I had to come after school every day, I had to come home after school.
Speaker 1: With your sister [Debra Cole (ph.)]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did she go to the Arts High School?
Speaker 2: No, she went to Weequahic High School.
Speaker 1: And where was that?
Speaker 2: That was more in our neighborhood.  It was on Chancellor Avenue in Newark.
Speaker 1: And was your mother's rationale for coming home, safety?  She wanted you to come--?
Speaker 2: I'm sure it was, she was that kind of mom, yeah.  So I didn't do any after school activity in those years.  In my--I did do the track team I think in my sophomore year but in my, the year you mentioned, '67 [1967], '68 [1968] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Nineteen sixty-seven [1967], um-hm.
Speaker 2: I didn't, didn't do anything.
Story_ID: 665482
Speaker 1: So in, in '68 [1968] is when you go to Newark Arts High School [Arts High School, Newark, New Jersey], right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Is this a public school?
Speaker 2: It's a public school.  At that time it was a school that required a test to get in, an art test, or a music test and it had a very small student body.  Now it's a huge school, but when I was a kid there it was a real small school.
Speaker 1: And many notable people have gone to this school?
Speaker 2: Right, right, the great--
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Melba Moore.
Speaker 2: --the great [HistoryMaker] Wayne Shorter went there, yeah.
Speaker 1: More recently, [HistoryMaker] Savion Glover--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Woody Shaw--
Speaker 2: Right, Sarah Vaughan I hear went there too.  Miriam--Melba Moore, I was going to say Miriam Makeba, but Melba Moore came back to visit when I was a student there.
Speaker 1: Really.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: Did you get to meet her?
Speaker 2: Well they kind of rushed her in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or hear her?
Speaker 2: --and yeah we had a big event in the auditorium she's on the stage, she sang a song, you know.
Story_ID: 665483
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So for you as an, an art student being in this environment when are you believing that you can make a living as an artist?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't figure I'd making a living as a child.  I remember when I lived in the projects [Stella Wright Homes, Newark, New Jersey] stepping outside one day and looking up and down the street wondering what I would do as an adult and I remember seeing the garbage truck and some guys doing land survey, surveyors and I said, "Yeah, maybe I'll do that.  That looks like an easy job." But that was just a moment's thought in those times.  Then I remember when I was in high school [Arts High School, Newark, New Jersey], my mom [Jacqueline Epps Cole] was dating a guy who was a cross country truck driver.  He owned two trucks.  He was a great man, he could cook, and he was cultural, with a shaved head, an earring and all that.  He impressed me a lot, really good man.  So I thought I'd be a truck driver then because I said if I'm driving a truck across country I can pull over and set up an easel and do landscapes wherever I am.  That was my plan, but by the time I was a senior in high school and had to choose a college, I decided I was just going to make a living as an artist and my family encouraged me to do graphic design instead of fine art.
Speaker 1: And did you do that?
Speaker 2: I did that and that's wasn't my first choice, my first choice was fashion design 'cause my major in high school was fashion design, but my sister [Debra Cole (ph.)] had a boyfriend who lived in New York [New York] who was a bit older than me.  His name was Zack Vas [ph.]; he ended up being A and R [artists and repertoire] at Motown [Motown Records].  But when we were kids he put the fear of homophobia in my family by saying, "Don't let him go to that school because of this, because of that." You know, that kind of stuff, so I didn't go to FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York] for that reason, but I got accepted.
Speaker 1: Wow.  FIT's a great school, hard to get into--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you go to the School of Visual Arts [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Right, I went to SVA instead, yeah.
Speaker 1: Which is a great art college.
Speaker 2: Yeah, back then it was a hippie school though, but it was cool, those years.
Speaker 1: It was a hippie school.  Tell me what you mean?
Speaker 2: It was all like drugs, sex and rock and roll at SVA.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yeah, all of our exams were take home exams.  It was just, the only way to describe it is the word of that time, it was just far out, you know and I can, I can honestly say that because I left SVA and went to Boston U [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] to have a more college experience and that's where I really noticed the contrast between the schools (laughter), but I ended up leaving BU and coming back to SVA to graduate.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Because BU was just too stiff, you know, I'd gone to this hippie school for two years, I just couldn't, I wasn't happy at BU.
Speaker 1: And SVA, one of the things that's unique about the School of Visual Arts is that all of the teachers have to be working artists?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Which is, many colleges and universities have people who teach who, who no longer do or never did whatever--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that their field is--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but at SVA that's a requirement?
Speaker 2: Right, I had Jonathan Borofsky for sculpture a West Coast artist who was really popular in New York back in the '80s [1980s] and '70s [1970s].  I had Chuck Close one year for painting and we all know who he is nowadays.
Speaker 1: And, and what year did you graduate from SVA?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-six [1976].
Speaker 1: Okay and who were other students there or teachers like you mentioned--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Chuck Close, who, who we might know?
Speaker 2: Well, I would think that Borofsky and Chuck Close were the better known ones from my time there because a lot of the professors that I had were illustrators who worked in commercial art, 'cause my major at SVA was media arts.
Speaker 1: Media arts and did that include graphic design?
Speaker 2: It did.
Speaker 1: Because isn't it true that SVA prepares you so that you will be able to work as an artist, not just--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes they did and that's a good point because when I graduated from SVA it never occurred to me to look for a job.  They encourage you to get out there with your portfolio and find work, do your own thing and I started doing that while I was still a student there.
Speaker 1: So--I, my husband went to SVA and I--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --wonder if you met him, it may have been at the same time.  His name is [HistoryMaker] George Chinsee.  He's a photographer, because he, you all are the same age.  I'm not sure when he--?
Speaker 2: No, I don't know him, but--
Speaker 1: But how many black students were there at that time?
Speaker 2: Less--
Speaker 1: Right, that's why I'm asking--
Speaker 2: --than I do with fingers, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Not many?
Speaker 2: No so, then I didn't know him, but the film department separated themselves from everybody else.  They were the elites, so there were black students in film that--
Speaker 1: And this was--he was photography but--
Speaker 2: --didn't associate with us.  Okay, so he would have, he would have been at our table in the lounge then.
Speaker 1: So they'd meet right there?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You would know each other.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But he talked, he has talked about the push--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --to, for students to go out and figure what--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --their work is going to be and to find--
Speaker 2: And that was a good thing.
Speaker 1: --apprenticeships and--
Speaker 2: That was a good thing.
Speaker 1: --did--
Speaker 2: I started at a graphic design company when I was at SVA.  Basically I would find work and I would share it with my friends and take it, you know, markup their, whatever they wanted, "You want two hundred bucks [dollars], okay I'll charge a client $250 or something like that." And I did that while I was at SVA and I had some pretty steady clients in, mostly in New Jersey.
Story_ID: 665484
Speaker 1: And just in terms of paying for college, did, did, how, how did you pay for college?
Speaker 2: I worked at Pathmark [Pathmark Stores, Inc.].  I worked in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The grocery store?
Speaker 2: --I worked on the night shift.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I worked there when I was in high school [Arts High School, Newark, New Jersey], so by the time I got ready to go to college they gave me the job of changing prices so I could make my own hours.  I had a date where I had--the prices would have to be changed so I could come in there with my label gun and take it with me off the shelf and change the price and put it back, as long as I got it done by their deadline it was cool.
Speaker 1: So they were accustomed to working with students, or did you, they trusted you?
Speaker 2: I think they trusted me because I had been there for so many years and my mom [Jacqueline Epps Cole] also worked there for a while.
Speaker 1: You graduate in '76 [1976]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what do you do next?
Speaker 2: Let's see, in '76 [1976] when I graduated from SVA [School of Visual Arts, New York, New York] I thought that my career would be writing and illustrating children's stories so I had samples of that that I would carry all around the city, knocking on a lot of doors and also I had my graphic design background so I went to ad agencies and magazines and record companies and all that stuff and I did that from '76 [1976] to '78 [1978], so I worked as a freelance graphic designer and illustrator and I found some work, not as much as I'd hoped to find, but I found work.  I did album covers for Savoy Records.  I did a couple of, I don't know if they published my covers, but I got paid to do covers for a couple of blue or pornographic novels back in those days and I did some illustrations for Uniworld, Uniworld Group ad agency [Uniworld Group, Inc.]--
Speaker 1: Uniworld was a big ad agency then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I did their General, General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] Black History Month campaign illustrations and I did book covers for Fawcett book publishers [Fawcett Publications] and I did political cartoons for the New Jersey Voice [ph.], like the Village Voice but in Jersey.  And I did any and everything that would come my way that involved imagination and paint pretty much.
Speaker 1: And so these book covers and things that you're doing are they figurative, what, what kinds of work are you doing at this time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the '70s [1970s] in New York [New York], photorealism was the thing, so when I was in school I learned to paint photo realistically, so that's what I was doing.
Speaker 1: And are they images of black people or are they, who are they, who--?
Speaker 2: Well see that was a challenge during those years.  I felt that I wasn't getting work because my people were, were not of the right tone.  Like Fawcett gave me two romance novels to do and when I brought--and they, they setup a photo session and they give me a photo of the models and everything and I'd bring it home and I'd paint it and they would say that my people looked too ethnic; so they paid me for them but they never used them because they looked too ethnic.  Also they were surprised that I actually drew the stuff myself.  A lot of artists at that time would just project the image on the canvas and trace it and then paint it in, but I didn't do that.  I actually drew it free hand and painted in.
Speaker 1: Did they like that?
Speaker 2: They spoke mostly about the fact that my people looked too ethnic, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you--
Speaker 2: So they--
Speaker 1: --try to make them look less ethnic?
Speaker 2: Well, they gave me two opportunities because I did two covers for them, so (laughter) it didn't quite work out.
Speaker 1: Well did the piece for Uniworld Group, so this is an African American--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --agency specifically getting work for the African American market--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --so they were happy with your ethnic images?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, they hired me to do portraits of Frederick Douglass for a General Motors campaign, so I did three of those for them during those years.
Speaker 1: Frederick Douglass is still doing a great job (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Freddie D, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then the political cartoons, are these also ethnic images?
Speaker 2: Yes.  The City of East Orange [New Jersey] is where the paper was published, had a very, what's the word, they had a very Trump-like [President Donald John Trump] political campaign going on, one mayor, mayoral candidate insulting another, all that kind of stuff, so the supporters of one team hired me to do these negative cartoons about the other candidate.
Speaker 1: And this is in, this is in Newark [New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but they're published in East Orange, so it was the East Orange mayor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: About the East Orange mayoral race and that was in the, in the '70s [1970s] so this is all between '76 [1976] and '78 [1978] right after SVA.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did a lot of logos also.
Story_ID: 665485
Speaker 1: And so this time, just for context, in 1970 is when Newark [New Jersey] has the first black mayor.
Speaker 2: Right, Ken Gibson [HistoryMaker Kenneth Gibson] was elected when I was in high school [Arts High School, Newark, New Jersey], yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And this is in the '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then, and, and right before then there were a few other black mayors in the country. Nineteen seventy [1970] is when Essence is founded, is when Black Enterprise is founded. So there is this broadening black consciousness.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: On, on, on the national front but as well as right where you, you're--
Speaker 2: Right, locally yeah.
Speaker 1: --where you're living.  Are you, does it seem like the doors are opening a bit for imagery, positive imagery of blacks?
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: 'Cause this is now a few years later--
Speaker 2: --but I mean I, I went to Black Enterprise and Essence and they never gave me a job, but Ebony gave me a job for Ebony Jr! magazine.  They published one of my stories and illustrated that.
Speaker 1: Right, Ebony Jr! at that time was still--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --going strong.
Speaker 2: I think they, that was in '77 [1977], they published one of my pieces.
Speaker 1: What kind of reaction did you get from Essence and Black Enterprise?
Speaker 2: Well, it's not, I don't know if reaction is the right word, when you're a freelance illustrator you come in and you show your portfolio and they smile and say, "That's nice, that's nice, thank you." So it's not a real reaction, but, but if you're successful in persuading them that you have what they need, they call you back and then you get more reactions.
Story_ID: 665486
Speaker 1: Let's talk a bit about this, the, the process because there's--there's the creation of work and there's the pitching and selling of work, which are two (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --completely different skills?
Speaker 2: Right, a lot of artists never cross that bridge.  I have so many friends that don't sell their work.  They never were able to fathom that.
Speaker 1: And being in the commercial space, having learned graphic design and cartoon work and illustrat- you know those kinds of things that, that can be commercial projects, you, you describe yourself as someone who is not as particularly outgoing at least as a child, so how are you managing these two different heads 'cause they're, they're different?
Speaker 2: Well I just had to evolve as a person.  I have let's see, maybe like around 1975 I was living in an apartment in Newark [New Jersey] in Colonnade Apartments [Pavilion and Colonnade Apartments] and I go to the, to the incinerator room and I find a book on the ground called 'Three Magic Words' ['Three Magic Words: The Key to Power, Peace and Plenty,' Uell Stanley Andersen] and I read that book and it just changed my whole way of thinking about everything.  It's kind of, you can say it's self-help, motivation kind of book, but all of its references were related to, or at least linked in spirituality and faith and that kind of thing and that pumped me up a bit, quite a bit.
Speaker 1: And when did you discover that?
Speaker 2: In 1975, but also I knew a generation of black commercial artists who were just slightly older than me who were all freelancers.
Speaker 1: And who were--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --actively working?
Speaker 2: Yeah, like I knew a guy named Jim Cummings [ph.] who had a magazine that he did everything himself.  I think it was call Pro Hoop [ph.] it was like a successful basketball magazine, so he would go to all the Knicks [New York Knicks] games and take all the shots and then he'd come home with his wife and his kids in front of the TV with a board in his lap cutting out stuff, pasting stuff up and then he'd publish it and it would be on the newsstand, so that was very inspiring and motivating to me.
Speaker 1: And who were some of the other people--
Speaker 2: Well it was a guy, another guy named Charles [ph.], better than Charles, there was a guy, what was his name, oh, Calvin Reed.  Calvin Reed ended up being one of the founders of Cablevision TV [Cablevision Systems Corporation], bringing cable television to Newark and that, eventually he sold to Optimum [Altice USA] and became a millionaire, so I knew him and his partners because he worked, he worked as, he worked for a, a book publisher in the city and had given me time to discuss business and things over the years.  I don't know where he is now and--
Speaker 1: So they inspired you?
Speaker 2: --yes, and there were a few others, another guy named Tom [ph.] whose last name I don't recall, but Tom was a, was a writer but he had a program at New Jersey Public Television [New Jersey Network] and a big studio and he hired me to be his assistant in that studio, basically I would just carry cameras and lights around for him, but we had a lot of great conversations.
Speaker 1: And when was this?
Speaker 2: This was also between '76 [1976] and '78 [1978].
Story_ID: 665487
Speaker 1: And during that time you also studied at the Arts Students League [Art Students League of New York, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I went there on the weekends--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for drawing, painting and anatomy.
Speaker 1: So you continued even after you completed SVA [School of Visual Arts, New York, New York], you continued your education?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yeah, but, but not, you know I'm, I'm not an academic, so I, it was mostly through inspiration of friends.  It's like I fell into a group of artists who were portrait artists and they all went to Arts Students League on the weekends.
Speaker 1: So you went (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So I started going with them.
Story_ID: 665488
Speaker 1: In '78 [1978] you moved to Newark, Delaware to work with a theater company [Stepping Stone Theatre Company]?
Speaker 2: Oh, you've done some research here, okay.  Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What, what, this was a children's theater company?
Speaker 2: Right, this was through the Comprehensive, Comprehensive Employment Training Act program [Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973], a federal program and I saw an ad in The Times [The New York Times] that there was a theater company in Delaware wanting to hire actors, now prior to that I had worked in theater before because I was so inspired by Baraka [Amiri Baraka] and he was a playwright you know, so during those years in high school there was a program called the sister cities program and your teacher had to select you for the program and I got selected, so I was able to go to Rutgers University [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] and study playwriting, acting and dance.
Speaker 1: When was that?
Speaker 2: This was all through my high school years [at Arts High School, Newark, New Jersey], yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and then now this is after college and you, you're re-engaging?
Speaker 2: Yes and I saw that sign.  Well in college in New York [School of Visual Arts, New York, New York], before Boston U [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts], which I guess was maybe '72 [1972], '73 [1973], I was at the Negro Ensemble Company [NEC] in New York [New York] too because they had a, a very prestigious workshop for, for young actors and I got in, into that program.
Story_ID: 665489
Speaker 1: Let's talk a bit more about the Negro Ensemble Company [NEC], so they, they started, I think it was 1968 when, with a very large grant to build Negro, what was called Negro theater (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right (laughter).
Speaker 1: --at the time and, and they ended up being predominate in terms of creating black theater.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes definitely.
Speaker 1: And so you went in what years?
Speaker 2: I, let me see, if I started college [School of Visual Arts, New York, New York] in 1972, maybe '73 [1973] and '74 [1974].
Speaker 1: So this is still in, in, in the beginning?
Speaker 2: It's in the beginning, but I was there when they produced 'Soldier's Story' [sic. 'A Soldier's Play,' Charles Fuller] on Broadway.
Speaker 1: Ah! Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So it's at a height.
Speaker 2: They were at a height.
Speaker 1: Right, because this is also when Denzel--this is the one time--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Denzel Washington worked with the Negro Ensemble.
Speaker 2: Yes, when I was in the Negro Ensemble, Denzel was there and Larry Fishburne [Laurence Fishburne].  Larry was in my class, but he was the only person in our class who had real work.  He was on a soap opera ['One Life to Live'] so we didn't see him that often and he was the youngest one in the class (laughter).
Speaker 1: Wow. And your, and what classes were you taking there?
Speaker 2: Just acting yeah, it helps you beat shyness.
Speaker 1: Sure and, and, and so do--[HistoryMaker] Douglas Turner Ward is who founded--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --one of--
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: --the founders.  Did you--
Speaker 2: --and [HistoryMaker] Robert Hooks.
Speaker 1: Did you work, interact with them at all?
Speaker 2: You know one of them taught our class every once in a while but they weren't there every--also my years, they were their Broadway years.  They were more involved with that.
Speaker 1: They were very--they, they produced a lot of work during--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at the time that you were there.
Speaker 2: But I had to audition for, there were probably about maybe twenty people in the class, ten males and ten females.
Speaker 1: And were you a part of any of the ensemble performances?
Speaker 2: No, we were kind of like in training so we didn't, we weren't on Broadway or anything like that, but we did workshops.
Speaker 1: And where, where--were the workshops at their same--
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York] I think it was, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you ever do live performances?
Speaker 2: With them live only within the confines of their organization.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But not to the public.
Story_ID: 665490
Speaker 1: Okay, so then let's fast forward to where we were which is 1978 when you go (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, the University of Delaware [Newark, Delaware].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: University of Delaware hosted the Stepping Stone theater arts company [Stepping Stone Theatre Company].
Speaker 1: And that's the one where you were?
Speaker 2: And that's the one, that's where I was, yes.
Speaker 1: And this is a children's theater company?
Speaker 2: Yes, funded through the federal government through the CETA program [Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973].  And I guess they'd say I got hired illegally because they were suppose to hire people who lived in the state where they were, but they advertised in The New York Times and I saw it and applied and auditioned and got the job.
Speaker 1: And then you moved there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, then I moved there.
Speaker 1: And how long did you work there?
Speaker 2: I stayed there for one year because their government grant was a one year grant.  After the grant they began doing like soap operas in the mall and I didn't hang around for that.  Also the arts scene was taking off here in this part of the country and I wanted to come back and be part of that.
Story_ID: 665491
Speaker 1: Since you were involved more broadly in the arts than some, you know, you're, you're acting, you're painting. You know, you're doing a number of different things?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How, how are you making the choice to switch?
Speaker 2: Well I would say how am I making a choice to commit--
Speaker 1: Okay to commit, okay.
Speaker 2: --because the commit was the first big task and it had to do with economics.  I recognized maybe sometime in the early '80s [1980s] that I'm doing all these things and not making any money, so I said I've got to focus on one thing and I think that awareness was prompted by the fact that I was also an athlete and I saw myself getting better at my event but I knew I could never be a champion because I didn't have the team that the professionals had.
Speaker 1: What were you doing athletically?
Speaker 2: I'm a marathon runner--so I just decided that I needed to choose.
Speaker 1: Where were you doing this running?
Speaker 2: Well I did New York marathon [New York City Marathon] twice, New Jersey Marathon twice and back in those days and then in the more recent years I did the Miami Marathon.  I never did Boston [Boston Marathon], but you know I had got my time from like 3:20 to 3:02 when the world record was like two hours and like ten minutes and I said the only way I'm going to get to get to two hours and ten minutes is if I make this a full time occupation and get a team behind me, so I took that same awareness and applied it to everything else I was doing and I knew I had to like focus on one thing for a while, so I said because in visual arts now you can add music, you can do performance, you can combine all those things together.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now meaning 2017?
Speaker 2: No, meaning 1980, '82 [1982], 1982.
Speaker 1: All right, so you're speaking of, in the moment when you're making that decision?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, so I decided to pull in and focus more on visual arts, yeah.
Speaker 1: Visual arts--and so you come back to New York [New York], is it New York where, where you come back?
Speaker 2: Yeah, New Jersey, yes.
Speaker 1: New Jersey (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Now that return from, from Delaware though was 1979, so in '79 [1979] I was still trying to do everything.  I mean I, I came back to New York and auditioned for like a black Chippendales event (laughter), you know, I said I can make some money and you know, I can travel et cetera, et cetera, but they didn't want to pay for rehearsals and I needed money so I didn't do that.
Speaker 1: Well and so in 1979, just for context, Chippendales was huge--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --it was one of, it was, it was a huge and legitimate business--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right, right.
Speaker 1: --in that space?
Speaker 2: Right, but these folks in Harlem [New York, New York] didn't want to pay for rehearsals.  They wanted me to come there every day and sing and dance and not get paid until they could book the gigs and I couldn't afford that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you couldn't afford to do that.
Story_ID: 665492
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you did a number of things.  You taught at a Job Corps training center in Newark [New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: Right, except (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You taught art though, so it was still--?
Speaker 2: I taught art, yes, yes.  So that period of my time, of my life, I would say from '78 [1978] to, to maybe '83 [1983] was very similar to my life from when my parents got divorced because I was in a lot of different places doing a lot of different things, so I can tell you now--so I came back to Jersey in '79 [1979], my oldest son was born in '78 [1978] so he, his mom and I lived together but not long, we had lots of conflicts, so I ended up living--moving in with my dad [Willie Cole, Sr.] and I stayed with him until 1980 and then I moved to South Jersey [New Jersey] to a town called Maple Shade with my high school sweetheart and she was very successful.  Her name at that time was Robin Dawson [ph.], but she became the first veejay on BET [Black Entertainment Television] and she, at that time she had a opportunity through I think it was, might have been called Capital Cities Communications, so they would take you right out of college and they would give you internships all over the country at all their newspapers and TV stations, so she was doing that so in the year that she and I got together which was 1980 she was at, she was an anchor at WPVI [WPVI-TV] in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and I was home painting everyday so I would drive her to work across the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge in my raggedy Fiat and then I would come home and I would paint.
Story_ID: 665493
Speaker 1: But then I had an injury 'cause my raggedy car radiator overheated and burned this arm all up to here (gestures) so I couldn't work and I couldn't, I couldn't use my left hand, I'm left handed too, so I started painting with my right hand and after a while it didn't make a difference, so I was able to sell paintings at a place called the starving artists gallery on one of the highways, I think it was maybe Route 7 [sic.] or something.  I would take photos from National Geographic magazine, the black kids you know in Africa or wherever and I would sell them to this gallery for fifty dollars a piece, so I was doing that.
Speaker 2: And how many pieces were you able to generate?
Speaker 1: I probably sold in, in that year maybe four or five pieces and I had schemes too though (laughter).  I had a product, I advertised in the back of Rolling Stone and the Village Voice.  My ad said, "A Hundred Ways to Practice Birth Control without Contraception," you know, and you'd buy it for one dollar and it was a pamphlet and I'd listed these 100 things (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And people bought it?
Speaker 1: --so I did that as a mail order thing.  And I also had a flyer for it that I would put under the doors of apartments in my area, so I was able to sell that, those for.
Speaker 2: And, and how many of them did you sell?
Speaker 1: I didn't sell like millions (laughter) but I sold enough to keep it going for a while, you know and it was, you know, I mean you think about it, How to practice birth control without contraception, number one, become a nun (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh so it was funny
Speaker 1: --number two, become a priest, number three, cum only when you're alone (laughter) not some--so it was stuff, it was stuff like that, but, but I was able to sell them.
Speaker 2: What did people say when they got it?
Speaker 1: I never got any letters back, I mean there was no Internet back then.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So I didn't get any quick responses.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That was clever (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So I just, so I did that and I did some freelance stuff that year.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well and by, by the way, I mean just that idea at this time--so this is what year are we talking about?
Speaker 1: We're talking about 1980.
Speaker 2: So 19--so this is 1980 which is you know, this is still disco, this is--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know it's, there's a whole lot of sex, drugs and rock and roll going on then and it's right before HIV [human immunodeficiency virus].
Speaker 1: Right, right, true.
Speaker 2: The next year--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --everything changes.
Speaker 1: True, true.  Of course you know those dates, but yes, you're right.
Speaker 2: But you were still in, in, in a different kind of world, people--
Speaker 1: I, yeah--
Speaker 2: --people were more afraid of having a baby than having a disease at that time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was going to say I was not part of the disco scene or any of that kind of stuff, I never got into that at all. And so yeah, I was able to sell those.
Story_ID: 665494
Speaker 1: I was, I was still writing stories and trying to sell them.  I was taking my portfolio around Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  I, I did some work for some hospice service.  I did their newsletter.  I did a bunch of logos.  I worked one day at the Yellow Pages in Philadelphia, they, but the work was so tedious I quit the first day, pasting up before computers, cutting out each name and address, lining it up with wax (laughter), so, so I quit that one.  So then my partner and I separated and I moved to Bound Brook [New Jersey], lived in my [maternal] grandmother's [Christine Groce Epps] house in Bound Brook because she now had gone to Florida because her father [Charles Groce] was ill, so I lived in her house for six months and worked at American Cyanamid [American Cyanamid Company], so that's, brings that all back around then, so during that time--
Speaker 2: That's when you were driving the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah the sweeping machine around and but at night.
Speaker 2: And what year are we talking about now?
Speaker 1: We're talking about maybe 1981.  It was the winter of '81 [1981], I moved there in December.  But at night I would just write and illustrate stories and try to sell them.  I already had the Ebony Jr! story under my belt so I thought that I could continue doing that for success.
Speaker 2: Now what kind of stories are you creating?
Speaker 1: Well back in those days I was writing only children stories and they were mostly about health and nutrition because that's one of my passions.  The story that Ebony Jr.! published was called 'Mother Goose Was Here But Now She's Gone And Left Black Eyed Peas And Chitterlings To Carry On' [ph.] and you know, it could have been rapped, it was all in rhyme, like a nursery rhyme.
Speaker 2: And, and you're illustrating these books so that the, the, the projects that you're working on, are they all featuring black images?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yes, yeah at that time, yes.
Speaker 2: And, and by, by the early '80s [1980s] there, there is a market for black children's books?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: When it--because we, we talked to [HistoryMaker] Jerry Pinkney recently--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and, and he's one of the pioneers in--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I know him well.
Speaker 2: --in that field when there were none.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And by, by late '70s [1970s], early '80s [1980s] there, there seems to be space--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and, and interest--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --how, how was it working for you?  Are you finding publishers, are you, are you able to--
Speaker 1: No, no I didn't find any publishers.  I started taking my stuff to magazines and I had a promise from Ms. magazine that never came through and the Village Voice promised me a job illustrating somebody else's stuff that never came through, so that's, to go back to where you were you said a few sentences ago, that's where the Job Corps came in, so I was offered a job to teach at the Job Corps training center.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: To teach art there, so I think that might be around '82 [1982], so in '82 [1982] I, I worked in New York [New York] as a graphic designer.
Story_ID: 665495
Speaker 1: Seventy-nine [1979] was the first time with Job Corps?
Speaker 2: When they started you mean?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And then you continued with that?
Speaker 2: I didn't work at Job Corps in '79 [1979].
Speaker 1: No, okay maybe I have that wrong.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I came later 'cause I, during my separation from my partner is when I had all these odd jobs, so I would say that that--
Speaker 1: You think it's more like '82 [1982]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the '80s [1980s] because I worked in New York [New York] as a graphic designer.  I worked at the Queens County office of overall economic development corporation [Queens County Overall Economic Development Corporation; Queens Economic Development Corporation].  I worked under--in Donald Mathis' [ph.] office, remember Donald Mathis, the web tech guy, so I worked in his office as a graphic designer.
Speaker 1: And this was a government office?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So do--you have a couple of times when you were being employed as an artist through a government program?
Speaker 2: Yes, but I didn't get this job through a government program though, actually maybe I did, I don't remember, but I worked there for a year, but I was able to convince them that the job didn't require me to be there every day, so I could just take the stuff home and do it 'cause I was doing like street maps and brochures for stores and things like that, so I--
Speaker 1: And, and you turned the work in on time?
Speaker 2: Yes and at night during that same year I worked teaching at Job Corps.
Story_ID: 665496
Speaker 1: You have your first major galley show in '88 [1988], is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: At Works Gallery?
Speaker 2: No, okay (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where was it?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Te- te-
Speaker 2: I should tell you so now in '82 [1982] I got a job doing computer graphics and I did that for maybe a year and a half or two years and by that time I was living in a loft in Newark [New Jersey] and I divided my loft into sections, it was maybe twenty-five hundred square feet, maybe three thousand square feet, so I used half of that as a gallery, so I was the Works Gallery.  I didn't show my own work there, I showed the work of all my friends there, so I had the Works Gallery and I had the Works Graphics [ph.] and I did--
Speaker 1: From '82 [1982]?
Speaker 2: Yes, and I did the art director thing again and I started giving other artists work and showing their work in the gallery.
Speaker 1: And that's, so--
Speaker 2: And that's, that's how I made my living in those years
Speaker 1: By, by showing the artists' work--
Speaker 2: By showing other artists--
Speaker 1: --and selling?
Speaker 2: --and selling.  We didn't sell a lot, but gave a lot of events that made money.
Speaker 1: So how did you make money?
Speaker 2: Well we had black Fridays, every Friday, we called it black Fridays and we'd have poetry and food and music and there would be an admission fee for that.  Then I had a partner from my days at BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] who was a deejay and I let him use the loft for parties, so we made a lot of money doing the parties and then just all the freelance stuff that I was generating through the graphic service.
Speaker 1: How long did you have Works Gallery?
Speaker 2: Well I personally was the director of the gallery and I think it was up until around 1984, because in '84 [1984] I got my first New York [New York] art dealer, I think that was around '84 [1984], so the board of directors ran the gallery after that, but just for a couple of years because they realized that they weren't about the gallery, they were about me, so they closed it up, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They closed--but it was where you lived?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, so they were still my team of supporters but we didn't rent a gallery anymore after that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 665497
Speaker 1: And so tell me about your first art show, 'cause that--
Speaker 2: My first professional art show, I, I was probably, I mean professional is a strange word, but I mean I had lots of shows all time.  My first sort of, I thought was a big deal was in 1984 and that was at the Littlejohn Smith Gallery in SoHo [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And what were you showing?
Speaker 2: Drawings and paintings of dogs mostly.
Speaker 1: Dogs?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but not like the blue dog, nothing humorous, pretty aggressive stuff.
Speaker 1: And how was that show received?
Speaker 2: It was well received.  I got a review I think in The Times [The New York Times] and a couple of other places and they sold most of the work, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what did you do after that?
Speaker 2: In terms of the art world?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well this woman she became my dealer and you know I was in a lot of group shows there after that, but then she went out of business and she moved to Washington, D.C. to partner with another dealer but she didn't take any of her New York [New York] artists with her, so that's how that evolved.  She and I are friends now, she is back in New York on 57th Street, so we're still friends (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What's her name?
Speaker 2: Jackie Littlejohn.
Speaker 1: So that was her gallery?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 665498
Speaker 1: You were an artist in residence at the Studio Museum in Harlem [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes, in 19--well I actually started in '88 [1988], but they called it an '89 [1989] residency.
Speaker 1: So that is a prestigious program started many years ago which allows artists the opportunity to--
Speaker 2: Do their thing full time, yeah.
Speaker 1: --do their thing, right, which is a luxury.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How long, how long was the program?
Speaker 2: One year, one year.
Speaker 1: What did you create while you were there?
Speaker 2: Well you know before I came there I was making things out of metal.  I didn't have a car so I had to think of something I could do there that didn't require me to bring all this scrap metal and I didn't know what it would be.  I think they accepted me based on maybe some paintings I had done, but I took some windshield wipers there with me and I thought I would just kind of make something out of these windshield wipers, make a whole series but that didn't work out, but on the way there one day I found a, a steam iron on the street so I started making art out of steam irons that year.
Speaker 1: And the steam iron that you found, was this an old one, new one, what, what was it?
Speaker 2: It was an old one.  It had been run over by a car 'cause my loft was right near the highway, so it was run over by a car and I had to walk from my loft to the Newark Penn Station [Pennsylvania Station, Newark, New Jersey] every day to go to Harlem [New York, New York], it was probably about a one mile walk and I would see this on the street every day, so after maybe four or five days I picked it up and brought it to the studio and took a lot of photos of it and just went on from there.
Speaker 1: This, this one steam iron that you see in the, in the street really changes--
Speaker 2: Changed my whole life.
Speaker 1: --your life, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean there's some you know, as I told you when we started I think I have a really great memory.  There's so many details to everything I say to you (laughter) so, but I know you know, I want to keep it flowing, but yes, it did change my life, it, but it, it was, everything came together, you know, I had been studying African art, one of my best friends was a dealer of African art so in his loft every night I got to experience the art first hand, like you can't go to (unclear) and take a mask off the wall and put it on your face, but--
Speaker 1: Is this (unclear).
Speaker 2: --but my friend would let me put the mask on him or myself.
Speaker 1: Who is this?
Speaker 2: His name was Lawrence Ramsey.  He was with the gallery in SoHo [New York, New York], SoHo called Leonard Kahan Gallery [L. Kahan Gallery of African Art].
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: So he was Leonard's partner.
Speaker 1: And so he let you handle the mask?
Speaker 2: Yes, I blew the ivory horn and put on a headdress and everything and he would always talk to me about African art and you know, he would say, "Well you know you're, you're a black man, maybe you have a good feeling for sculpturing, you should try it." 'Cause I'd primarily been a painter up to that point, you know I started making things that were kind of sculptured because I'd taken a jewelry making class at the Newark Museum [Newark, New Jersey] and I realized that jewelry is just little sculpture, so I started looking for things to make jewelry with and then that's how I started using found objects in my sculpture.  That's what led me to pick up the iron, it was a found object, but my connection with Lawrence Ramsey led me to make things that were African, but also in that same year the Yoruba awareness was big in Newark [New Jersey].
Story_ID: 665499
Speaker 1: This is '89 [1989]?
Speaker 2: Yes, and it, well '88 [1988] for me and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh right.
Speaker 2: --and '89 [1989] yeah, so there was at Rutgers University [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] every Sunday I would go to a African dance class with drummers, dancers, people selling books and food.  I had friends who were Yoruba practitioners who would invite me to ceremonies, so all that just mixed in together to make that iron have meaning for me and changed my life.
Speaker 1: Because what you, what you ultimately did with the iron was, and while at the Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York] was what?
Speaker 2: Well I started out by taking the iron apart and reassembling like all the parts from one iron, putting them back together as something totally different, something that looked very African, so that's what I did first.
Speaker 1: Did you start as masks or--
Speaker 2: No, I started as figures and--
Speaker 1: Three dimensional figures.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, like, because you know in the African art of course there are larger pieces, but in the gallery you see a lot of pieces that are like this big (gesture) so I started making things like that out of an irons, but one day you know, I asked myself--okay so I'm making these little power figures out of an iron, well what's the evidence of their power and I realized that evidence of the power of the iron is in the scorch, so then I then I started scorching canvas to go with the sculptures, yeah, but you know, I view that as a very magical, deeply spiritual time and I don't even know if I can express it fully, but I lived in a place that was, I lived in the Ironbound section of Newark [New Jersey],  I lived in a loft that use to be a sweatshop.  Once I started scorching I started discovering scorches in my loft on the floor 'cause it was a sweatshop.  I guess they'd dropped an iron a few times.  I'd never seen them before, but there were scorches right on the floor in the place I lived in and I had also come to a point of like personal development that just that, things were just happening for me at every turn, like I'm walking down the street coming from the Studio Museum one day and I don't have a dime in my pocket and I see a dollar blow right by me in the wind on a non-windy day, night rather.  So I followed that dollar and I come to a corner and there's probably like thirty bucks on the street right there, that dollar had blown out of that pile or something, so that's magical stuff for me you know; or I'm making something and I say, "Man if I just had one more iron." So I leave the loft and I start walking down the street and I find an iron on the street, so all those kinds of things started happening to me.
Speaker 1: And you finding irons on the street is not a normal thing to find?
Speaker 2: True, so, so that's led me to my whole life possibly today, I truly believe in personal magic today.  I believe in mind power, so, now if you take, all this awareness goes back to me finding that book ['Three Magic Words: The Key to Power, Peace and Plenty,' Uell Stanley Andersen] in the incinerator--
Speaker 1: Yes (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) (laughter) back in those days, but it's all true for me.
Story_ID: 665500
Speaker 1: Now at the, the Studio Museum in Harlem [New York, New York] who are the other artists who were working with you (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was there with Renee Greene and John Rozelle.
Speaker 1: And, and is there interaction between you, how, how does it work?
Speaker 2: Well see nowadays they have a large facility.  Each artist has a studio, but in my day we all shared one big space, so we did have interaction, at least conversation you know, Renee and I became very good friends.  John was older and he was also from out of town, from Chicago [Illinois].  Renee was from New Jersey like me, so we knew some of the same people, so we had interaction.  We didn't collaboratively work together, but I think we did inspire each other.  I remember John looking at my work and saying, "Those scorches are going to do it for you my brother." And that was encouraging for me.
Speaker 1: Who was running the Studio Museum then?
Speaker 2: Kinshasa yeah, Cromwell.
Speaker 1: Cole--?
Speaker 2: Cromwell, right, Kinshasa Cromwell [sic.]?
Speaker 1: It's not that.
Speaker 2: Conwill, then.
Speaker 1: --Holman Conwill?
Speaker 2: Holman, yes.
Speaker 1: Kinshasha Holman Conwill.
Speaker 2: See I leave the Holman out because Houston [Houston Conwill], her husband was a friend mine (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, he just recently passed.
Speaker 2: Oh he did?  Wow.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, last year. The Studio Museum at this, at the time that you're there, how, how is it being received in the community?
Speaker 2: In the Harlem [New York, New York] community?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay, so I can't speak for the perception of the whole community first of all, but I had a friend who was a guitar player who sat in front of the museum playing every day.  He was basically--people thought he was a bum and a wino.  He might have been a wino, but he wasn't a bum.  He was just a musician who'd had gone through a lot of changes and after a while they chased him out from in front of the museum.  He had been there for years, so that's one awareness, one awareness I have about the relationship between the museum and the community, but in general I really, I really couldn't say, you know, I mean I would go into the community and hit all the stores looking for irons so I was well received in the community, but they had events there and you know the art world is sometimes a mystery to a lot of people who are outside of the art world, so there would be people coming to these events, but I'm not sure they were from the community or not, you know.
Speaker 1: Well the Studio Museum has been a New York City [New York, New York] and even broader draw for a long time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause I remember Miles Davis came there for an interview. [HistoryMaker] McCoy Tyner came there and the place was packed.
Speaker 1: Did you attend those interviews?
Speaker 2: I attended the McCoy Tyner interview, but I missed the Miles because I had to pick up my son from school.
Story_ID: 665501
Speaker 1: Tell me when was the moment that you realized you had to dig in and as you say crank it up to be an artist?
Speaker 2: Well, fortunately when I lived in Newark [New Jersey] in this huge beautiful three thousand square foot loft my rent was $250 a month, so life was good (laughter), but in 1988 I became a single parent and that was the moment where you know--before that I, I use to call myself a dirt hippie.  I, I didn't care what I looked like you know, I didn't--nothing really mattered, I mean I was making a living but my life didn't cost a lot, but now suddenly I had a ten year old boy who, who I was everything to.  I was his god, his role model and his provider.
Speaker 1: And had you been a couple with his mom before?  Were you a family--?
Speaker 2: Just for one year when he was born and not even the whole year, but I did see him every other weekend and every holiday, so we had a good relationship.
Speaker 1: And when did you become a single father?  That implies that he's now with you?
Speaker 2: Right, he came to live with me in 1988, yeah, when he was ten years old.
Speaker 1: So did you petition for that because it's not--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  That's a long, a longer and darker story that I'm not going to go into, but yes.  Yeah, I won the court battle for that.
Speaker 1: And then, then you, you become a single father which is a completely different experience?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You were free before to do what you wanted weren't you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, more or less, yes, exactly I was 100 percent free.
Speaker 1: And the responsibility of taking care of your child includes financial responsibility?
Speaker 2: Right, right and also you know, time management, which was a plus to learn to manage my time better because he had a schedule with meals and school and bed and homework, so it was a great experience.
Speaker 1: And that's '88 [1988], it was--well, that's the same year that you started working with the Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes and before my son came to live with me I had two choices that year.  I had planned to like, go to France and stay there for a year, but the opportunity came to me to have my son with me I decided that I would take the residency in Harlem [New York, New York] instead.
Story_ID: 665502
Speaker 1: Okay and in, in this residency do you go to the, to the Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York] every day?
Speaker 2: Every day, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's part of the agreement?
Speaker 2: Well, no.
Speaker 1: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The part of the agreement is you had a studio on the premises.  You don't have to come every day if you don't want to, but since I was working every day in my studio at home, it was no problem for me to go there every day and work in that environment, plus it was inspiration.  I enjoyed sharing the studio with two other artists [Renee Greene and John Rozelle], 'cause that's the best part of art school for me.  And I enjoyed seeing my man, his name was Satan [ph.], a guitar player in front of the museum.  I enjoyed seeing him every day and talking to him, so.
Speaker 1: And you, you are evolving what you do with the iron?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: The, the, the scorching on fabric, was it--the scorching on canvas as well?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I started on canvas and then on paper and then on wood and nowadays probably mostly paper and wood.
Speaker 1: And some of the irons that I've seen that you have look like, like the old, like the flat irons, like what my [maternal] grandmother [Christine Groce Epps] used to have--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I've got a variety of irons, I mean, you think I've got a lot of shoes, I've got a lot of irons too (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, and so your search for irons is taking you where?
Speaker 2: Everywhere that I go up until about ten years ago I would hit every thrift store to look for irons.  In the beginning as I mentioned earlier, the irons were finding me on the street.  I never had to like, buy one, but once I got my current dealer in New York [New York] and she was selling a lot of these pieces I had to start buying irons to meet the demand so I would just hit all the thrift stores.
Speaker 1: Well the iron found you on the street.  As, as you get into it are you also getting into the history of black people and ironing and I mean is it (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, well I was already, I was already into the history of black people.  I didn't get into the history of ironing, but I had a personal experience that became very inspirational and that is my great-grandmother worked as a domestic all of my life so I'm able to tie her stories into the iron and then to even expand from that and think about it as a, as a line or journey that some African captives or slaves had to experience whether you worked in the big house or in the field, so since she was a domestic and her husband [Charles Groce] was a minister I said, "Okay, well they must have been house Negroes," (laughter). So that inspiration and then my awareness of Malcolm X 'cause I, I use to work at the library as a kid and all these years, all these years later I can say when I worked at the library as a kid I stole the complete works of Malcolm X on vinyl, so I still have that to this day, so I played all the speeches and the one called the house Negro and the field Negro tied into my own extrapolations about my great-grandparents and descendants before them on my mom's [Jacqueline Epps Cole] side, so that was my history of the iron through usage in the family.
Speaker 1: Well and then there's the, the, the scorching brings to mind, branding.
Speaker 2: Yes, well that awareness--I was big on a double entendre, I still am to this day and those were the years of fashion branding too, like my son was into Fila [Fila USA, Inc.], everything in his room was Fila so I had a big awareness of brands, so I knew that I was branding and branding myself and you know tying it to the slave experience I was very aware of all those things.
Story_ID: 665503
Speaker 1: And, and then with all of that depth of history through this iron and the imprint of the iron, scorch iron, you, you then start making masks?
Speaker 2: I started making masks out of shoes mostly though.
Speaker 1: Oh it wasn't, it wasn't with the iron?
Speaker 2: I don't think I've, I've made a couple masks out of irons too.
Speaker 1: I thought I saw that.
Speaker 2: But the masks out of irons just, you know I don't plan the stuff out, so I'm, I used to say that it's like if you're a archeologist you go to a dig site and you find all of these bones, they're just bones until you put them together and tell somebody they're something else.  If I have a table filled with irons so I just start at whatever comes up.  It's like having a new set of building blocks or Tinker Toys and whatever happens, so I have made a couple of masks, but they were very small.  My mask making became more a part of my work with hair dryers.
Speaker 1: And that was starting when?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Okay, so I'm at Harlem, at the Studio Museum in Harlem [New York, New York] in '88 [1988], so probably that same year.
Speaker 1: You started working--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and how did that come about, did you see a hair dryer in the street?
Speaker 2: Well, like I said I was a painter pretty much, you know when I, when I lost my job as a computer graphics artist I was able to get unemployment and I said, "Okay, so this is my scholarship, I'm going to have to work this a lot." So I was taking a jewelry making class at the Newark Museum [Newark, New Jersey] and realized these are just little sculptures, so now I'm making jewelry for myself out of found objects and I'm walking down the street following rusty things and I come to this abandoned factory and I go inside and I see a mountain of hair dryers so I got, went back to my studio and got a shopping cart which I found on the street.
Speaker 1: This is an abandoned--
Speaker 2: Factory--
Speaker 1: --factory.
Speaker 2: This cart probably belonged to a homeless person but it was parked so the guy stole his cart, I don't know, but I made like several trips back and forth and got every hair dryer out of that factory and began to make stuff out of the hair dryer, so this might have been--'cause I didn't show those in Harlem, so this might have been 1990 actually for the hair dryers.
Speaker 1: After you've finished?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 665504
Speaker 1: So the work that you, you create while you're at the Studio Museum in Harlem [New York, New York] with, with the irons, do you sell this work?
Speaker 2: Yes, my show at the Studio Museum was, was almost a complete sellout.  One collector, a gentleman named Dennis Derrick [ph.]; he purchased probably five of my pieces from that show.
Speaker 1: And at this point it's '88 [1988], well is it '88 [1988]?
Speaker 2: Eighty-nine [1989], yes, yes--
Speaker 1: What are you selling your work for?
Speaker 2: I don't know, probably like maybe fifteen hundred dollars maybe, yeah, 'cause this; this was before the big art boom as well.
Speaker 1: Right, but fifteen hundred dollars is a respectable--
Speaker 2: Yeah, for somebody who couldn't sell anything for more than five hundred dollars before (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, so being at the Studio Museum in Harlem had an impact economically on you, could--?
Speaker 2: It had an impact economically on what I could produce because I could afford to buy hardware if I needed hardware.  It had an impact on my ego.  I saw my value, inner value go up because every artist that I knew wanted that opportunity, so and I got it, so suddenly I felt that I was a full time professional and I had no doubt that my life would continue on this line.
Speaker 1: So you had a consciousness shift?
Speaker 2: Well I had that shift back in '84 [1984]--
Speaker 1: With that book ['Three Magic Words: The Key to Power, Peace and Plenty,' Uell Stanley Andersen].
Speaker 2: --when I got; when I was represented by a gallery--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in SoHo [Littlejohn Smith Gallery, New York, New York], so that was the first big shift.  So that was kind of like a- another, a seal I guess on top of that just, it gave me more confidence.
Story_ID: 665505
Speaker 1: Well, and then in '91 [1991] you received the Penny McCall Foundation Grant.
Speaker 2: Yes, I, I did receive that.
Speaker 1: And talk about the, the work that, that you made during that time?
Speaker 2: Okay, I, I have a strong feeling that publicly from 1989 to 2000 I was dominated by the steam iron and it was a deliberate choice because of self-branding.  I've noticed that a lot of artists do the same thing their whole career, I knew that I didn't want to be like that, but I knew to get established I'd have to present myself that way, so, so outside of the public world I was doing the pastel portraits of family members, doing hair dryers.  If I had a show out of the New York [New York] metropolitan area I would do something completely different.
Speaker 1: But for branding purposes through your--
Speaker 2: Yep
Speaker 1: --galleries?
Speaker 2: For galleries I did just the iron stuff.
Speaker 1: And so when you got this grant was it continuing in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --that work?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What are the pieces, lawn nigger and field nigger?
Speaker 2: House and field--
Speaker 1: Oh, house--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What are--?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  The piece is actually called 'House and Field' [Willie Cole].
Speaker 1: 'House and Field' (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Somebody else added those other words to it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, that, that's--
Speaker 2: I called it 'House and Field.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well 'House and Field' is the Malcolm X speech you know, and house would be--first it's made from two lawn jockeys, one is named House and one is named Field. The one named House holds the symbols of the house Negro, so he's dressed in his regular long jockey you know, suit with the vest and the pants and the hat, but he's holding a cross, the Christian cross, whereas the field Negro is like an nkisi, so he's got nails all over his body.  He's wearing a, like a warrior skirt, feathered headdress and mirrored eyes, so it's, it's pretty much just showing just the contrast of the house Negro and the field Negro.  So I made a, a story in my mind that the--Malcolm says that if the house, if the master got sick the house Negro would say, "What's the matter boss, we sick?"  So I took that as a queue, so now my house Negro works in a house and if the house, if a revolt broke out or something his, his weapons would be his iron and his ironing board, you know, the iron you could do this with it (demonstrates), you could burn somebody with--the ironing board is his shield.  So I imagined that the field Negro at night strips off all of his plantation traits and just becomes a, a full functioning African warrior, so that's what that piece was about.
Speaker 1: And she purchased those pieces, right?  Penny McCall?
Speaker 2: Somebody has them, yeah it's possible (laughter).  I don't really have memorized who owns most of the work (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: But, yes.
Story_ID: 665506
Speaker 1: So you begin working with shoes.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is that around '93 [1993]?
Speaker 2: That's around '93 [1993], around (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How, how, how, how does shoes come into your world as an artist?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I was an artist in resident at the Fabric Workshop [Fabric Workshop and Museum] in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and Kippy Stroud [Marion Boulton Stroud] who, who was the founder of that place had organized a show at Eastern State Penitentiary [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  I think it was called 'Prison Sentences' ['Prison Sentences: The Prison as Site, the Prison as Subject'] or something like that, so we each got a big part of the prison yard to do things in and because I was by that time a serious family man with kids around me, I decided I would make a playground in the prison, but I wanted to have something to hang in the playground that you see, in, in the, in the inner city and you see shoes, sneakers over wires, so my son who was a little boy at that time gave me all of his old sneakers and I sewed them together, but my vision, 'cause at time I actually thought of things to make, I don't think of things to make anymore, I just open myself up to it, but at that time I thought that I would make a jumpsuit and tie the sneakers onto it so they'd bounce when you danced, but I didn't have enough to do that so I just tied them together into a big ball and hung it over a wire in the, in the playground I'd made in the prison yard, but I recognized in that moment that I wanted to get more sneakers, so I went to the thrift store to get more sneakers, but when I walked in the high heels caught my eye.  They were--well sneakers are pretty fancy nowadays of course, but back in those days they were just black and white, plus they were used, really used in the thrift stores whereas the high heels looked brand new.  They came in all textures and colors.  They were just beautiful, so I switched to high heels.
Speaker 1: And, and in, in the beginning what are you making out of the shoes?
Speaker 2: Well the first thing I made was a chair because, because of my whole, what some people call my cornballedness, or my love for double entendres.  I was planning to make a shoebox kind of--as an artist I saw it made a box, it might have been, I don't know, but it was--I was going to make a box and have the heels of the shoe inside, kind of like a Lucas Samaras with the pens but with heels, but then I started making that box I said, "Man this could be a chair." So I switched and turned it into a chair, so that was the first piece I made with shoes, a chair.
Speaker 1: And, and you said that you went to the thrift shops, went to a thrift shop looking for the sneakers and found the heels--what is your search for shoes becom- ?  What did it turn into?
Speaker 2: Well now my search for shoes is going through my own collection 'cause I have so many shoes.  I had a studio that was a helicopter hangar and it was like a big indoor fruit market where I had bins all around, shoes separated by color, texture or heel size, so I could just go to my two tone selection and pull out five pairs of black and whites, whatever but I moved out of that space about four years ago, so when I moved out I threw a lot of shoes away which I regret to this day.
Speaker 1: So before you--let's, let's backup. How did you get these shoes?  How did you accumulate the shoes in the beginning?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well the, when I made the, the chair I would go to the thrift store and I'd pay full used shoe price, say anywhere from $1.50 to $3 or $4 a pair, but that was expensive I thought, so I then went to The Salvation Army thrift store warehouse because the warehouse distributes to all the satellite stores and I just struck a deal with them where I would buy all the high heel shoes at that moment in the store at that moment.  I'd buy every shoe here for fifty cents a pound, so they bagged them and weighed them up and I bought all the high heels in one day.
Speaker 1: And how many shoes did you walk away with?
Speaker 2: I couldn't even begin to count them. I mean it, it took me maybe three or four vanloads to get them all to my studio.
Story_ID: 665507
Speaker 1: And at this point your studio is the hangar so it's large?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: My studio was in Newark [New Jersey] then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In, in the Ironbound, the factory there.
Speaker 1: And so you begin in Newark?
Speaker 2: I began in Newark.
Speaker 1: How do you, how do you get to this hanger, air- airport hangar?
Speaker 2: Well I had the studio in Newark up until probably 19--maybe 1999.
Speaker 1: And is that where you had also had the gallery [Works Gallery, Newark, New Jersey], in the same place?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Three thousand square foot place?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, but they tore the building down and I had to move.
Speaker 1: And that was around what--?
Speaker 2: And by then I was living here, so--
Speaker 1: And that was around what time?
Speaker 2: You mean the building was--
Speaker 1: When, when the building was torn down?  When you had to move.
Speaker 2: I think it was '98 [1998] or '99 [1999], yeah, so--
Speaker 1: So there was a lot of change--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in your life in, in that period, '98 [1998], '99 [1999]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't remember if my work changed.  I was still doing the irons as a dominant approach to art making though, but I moved here I think in '93 [1993] or '94 [1994] and I would catch the train to Newark every day to work, so--
Speaker 1: And the, the airplane hangar how did that come?
Speaker 2: That came about where--I have a good friend who was in advertising, he's a wealthy man and when I moved here I saw a building that I wanted to buy and not knowing how to go about it, the building was empty but there were people working around the building so I asked them about the building and they told me the building is not for sale, that it was a protected EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] site, so I let it go and then a year later my friend buys the building.  He wasn't my friend then, but he bought the building, so I see a light on in the building now so I find out who owns it and they say the guy he, he's in an office across the street and he, he rents me a space in the building for quite a few years.  We become good friends, but when he rented me the space he was renovating the building.  He was closing his big office on one side of the street.  We had a whole crew in there working in advertising, a whole, like company because technology had changed, so now it was just him and his computer, so he moved into the other building and he had the second floor and I had the first floor and he gave me a good price, I mean this building was huge.  I can't even guess, maybe twelve thousand square feet on each floor, something like that, but once he finished renovating the building I had to go, I mean that, my loft in that building is a barbecue restaurant now with a bar (laughter).  So when I lost that building I went on Craigslist and I saw a helicopter hanger, so I got that.
Speaker 1: And how long were you in that space?
Speaker 2: I was there from 2005 until about four years ago.
Speaker 1: And, and did it just become too big?  Why did you then?
Speaker 2: I guess this is all about honesty, so I, I left because I, I had a divorce and my alimony was the same as my rent plus I was left in this big house, you know I was here with the wife and four kids for all those years, but suddenly it was just me, so I said, "Okay, I'll use the house as a studio." And that's what I've been doing for the past four years.
Story_ID: 665508
Speaker 1: With the shoes you begin doing the work in '93 [1993] and it has evolved over time? What are the, what are the, kinds of artistic expression that you are developing for the shoes?  What are you making?
Speaker 2: Currently what I'm making with the shoes?
Speaker 1: Starting back from you know, as you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well with, with all the work, and I kind of discover this, or maybe begin to apply this with the, with the irons, but I'm telling myself that I am working to exercise the memory in these items, whether it's true or not I always start with that, with that premise, so all my shoe pieces, I feel their, their personality, the woman that wore them is in this shoe still, the spirit of that person is in this shoe or on the shoe, so I put those together to, you know, bring that forward, I mean definitely with the masks and things.
Speaker 1: So you, you describe having organized the shoes by color and plus whatever their similarities are. So there's, there's that, but you're bringing more than one pair of shoes into it, so what is that spiritual relationship that you are defining I guess, from multiple pairs of shoes to put them into a mask or--?
Speaker 2: Oh I feel--my sister [Debra Cole (ph.)] would call it, let go and let God, but you know I don't use that kind of language, but so for me it's just about being open to the inspiration, don't have a preconceived notion of what you're doing, just you know, you've got a pile there.  Like when I finish a piece I'm always amazed and my friend [Lawrence Ramsey], the African art dealer, told me I have to freak myself up first before I can freak the world out, so I'm just looking to get that moment that just blows my own mind and it comes through play because you can't play unless you're relaxed, so you know, the pieces to me kind of, they tell me what to do, what piece to pick up.  I create certain limitations because when I was a painter I worked in limitations from reading about the Impressionists and the point was rather they worked from following the illustrator, Maxfield Parrish, I would always limit my color palette to just the primary colors and never used the color black; so that idea fused in with a little bit of Buddhism has led me to these ideas about oneness and you know just everything is a multiplication of a single element.

Speaker 1: Are you a practicing Buddhist?
Speaker 2: No, I don't practice any organized religion at all.
Speaker 1: But you studied a bit?
Speaker 2: Well I was a Buddhist for a while, I think maybe in the '70s [1970s], but I was Nichiren Daishonin and I was Nichiren Daishonin because I loved the sound of the chants.  I'd go to these huge meetings in Philadelphia [Pennsyvlania] with thousands of people and we're all together, "Nam myoho renge, nam--," and the sound was just so beautiful, but when I asked someone, say, "Well, what does this mean in the (unclear)?" Nobody in my group knew what it meant.  Nobody could translate it for me, so I, so I stopped.  So now I read about different religions, but I just keep my spirit open to energy and awareness and what I need to be aware of seems to come my way.  Now need is based in what makes me feel comfortable at that moment I guess, so, I call myself a no frills nature worshipper.
Story_ID: 665510
Speaker 1: You described the--when, when you were telling me earlier about the way you construct the shoe sculptures that you're looking for it to have three dimensional--
Speaker 2: Yes, views all around, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) views that different views as you look at it from different sides?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: How, with that intention, how are you, how are you literally constructing these pieces?
Speaker 2: Well, you know after so many years I can look at a single shoe and know what's what, I mean and it changes.  I'm always surprised, like there are these pieces you see around here in these photographs, they each have something that was new in the awareness, so there's still a lot for me to learn about what this shoe can become, but in the moment that I think I know something it makes it easy to, to add on to it because like I know this long heel has to be an arm or a leg, you know, just things like that it's hard to explain.  Like I, I know that your eyes are two colors, so if I've got a two tone shoe I know this shoe might end up being an eye, you know (laughter) and so things like that, but I really don't, don't know until it happens, but they, they kind of make themselves.  Like I did a lot of masks last year for a show in Hong Kong and they were like no masks I've ever made before, discovered all new things and they were kind of a return to the shoe sculpture because I kind of stopped, everything comes in phases and stops, sometimes it returns sometimes it doesn't.
Story_ID: 665511
Speaker 1: Well the- and there's a, a period of time when you were making flowers?
Speaker 2: Yes, I've made flowers like giant blossoms out of shoes because, you know when I was a kid in the '70s [1970s] through those rock and roll era stuff and in college, Carlos Santana made an album ['Love Devotion Surrender'] and it had a long poem or prayer written on the cover by Sri Chinmoy who was his guru at the time and one of the song lyrics was, "Love, devotion and surrender," so I take that as, as a mantra and I recognize that the ocean is a body filled with single droplets of water that have surrendered for the greater, you know, so, so that's what I do.
Speaker 1: Well it, it, they look like a meditation, so as, as you describe--
Speaker 2: So I recognize that each, each shoe is a leaf--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --you know, so (laughter).
Speaker 1: Is those, are those pieces large?
Speaker 2: They're eight feet in diameter, yeah.
Speaker 1: I've just seen pictures of them.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They look large and they--
Speaker 2: But see I'm also--I have a friend, I guess I'm naming so many people--
Speaker 1: No that's fine.
Speaker 2: --because I knew this is a historical document, but an artist named--wow, it was on the tip of my tongue--but a Brazilian artist, Judith De Santos [ph.] who I met in 1988 who lived in Newark [New Jersey], she said to me that her work was conceptual as well as contextual, so I took that to heart and never forgot it, so anything I make out of shoes has to have a connection to a female, so that's how flowers came about, you know.  In fact my--oh, a friend of mine at that time told me she loved the gerber daisy [Gerbera] and I looked at gerber daisy and said, "Hey, that's shoes," (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Actually, yeah, I could see, yeah, I, I see that when you say that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a flower.
Story_ID: 665512
Speaker 1: I want to talk about the shoes a bit more (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Because they're different--you had so many shoes and they're different themes and we just talked about flowers and the gerber daisy [Gerbera]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --what are so- and, and you started with the chair.
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: What are some of the other themes that are playing out through the shoes?
Speaker 2: Right, well I've made chickens, remember the, the connection is female energy, so you know I've made what I call goddesses.  I've made chickens because of the slang of chicks.  I've made (laughter), I've made dogs because of the derogatory female dog name and, and just all kinds of masks in general and, and furniture, chairs and couches.  I've made flowers, bouquets, that's where it's at so far but I'm open still 'cause I always think it's over, like when I did, when I made the piece for the show in Hong Kong--
Speaker 1: When was that?
Speaker 2: I felt--that was last winter.
Speaker 1: Twenty sixteen [2016].
Speaker 2: Yes, I thought that was it for me, but I got a commission out of that so I've got to make a piece for that.
Speaker 1: Well and you said at, at, at the biggest point you had about a million pairs of shoes?
Speaker 2: Right, maybe more, I had never counted them, but what I have now is less than one twentieth.  What I have now is in the hangar and I threw away a dumpster full of browns and greys when I left the hangar.  I just kept the brighter colors (laughter).
Speaker 1: And the brighter colors attract you why?
Speaker 2: Just more possibilities, you know more excitement.  I mean at, to me all the work is about harnessing energy so there is more energy through you know color science and those brighter colors, or at least there's energy that I'm interested in extracting.
Story_ID: 665513
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the masks, you know there--you are described as an artist who's using these kind of found objects, or I mean shoes, fashion objects, accessories and creating a new incarnation of an African mask. You've mentioned your friend from many years ago, the African art dealer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, the African art dealer, Lawrence Ramsey, yes.
Speaker 1: --letting you handle these masks and pieces.  How, in, in your conscious awareness how is the African masks melting into your masks, what's happening?
Speaker 2: I just aesthetically you know, I mean we get stuck into realism and during the '70s [1970s] in arts school, we learned photorealism so African art in general going all the way back to Picasso's [Pablo Picasso] time was, was a vehicle that would free their thinking so they could now see the face as something beyond just a regular straight nose, two eyes and all, nose and mouth, so African art frees an artist aesthetically.
Speaker 1: And do you study African masks in the sculptures you're creating your own?  Is there any of that kind of--
Speaker 2: Well I certainly have a lot reference material, a lot of books and things, but I don't look at it while I'm making my work, I mean I, I mean you know, I'm in that age group now and half of this stuff is in my head already, so I just play with the materials now, you know.
Speaker 1: Was it a conscious intention to have them take on the, the, the energy of an African mask?
Speaker 2: Well now I just think of myself as making masks because mask making is universal and there are a lot of masks I see in the Japanese art that I like a lot, so just putting it all together you know.  I think reading everything by Joseph Campbell back in those days has made me more of a universalist in many ways.  It's, it's given me a, a religious belief that combines every religion in the world and it's done the same thing to my art, so the marketing of African American artists has led the world to see I make an African mask--
Speaker 1: As opposed to you--
Speaker 2: --but I'm just making masks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: Often true.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 665514
Speaker 1: You have been a recipient of a number of foundation grants and awards from Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation grant in '95 [1995], Joan Mitchell Foundation award in '96 [1996]. Are you applying for these things?  How are they coming to you?
Speaker 2: No, most of these things you have to be nominated for, so I've never applied for anything.
Speaker 1: But this obviously helps you to do your work?
Speaker 2: Well it gives you a validation and it's like you know getting a, a degree or pedigree at least, you know (laughter), but it helps but I tell you making art is such a journey that by the time that money comes if you want to spend it on your work it's already spent.  You've already spent everything else you have so this, so you--so okay, so now I use this money to, to buy something else or to pay a bill that I didn't pay because I wanted to make this, that or the other, so--
Story_ID: 665515
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell me about the '97 [1997] piece, 'Stowage' [Willie Cole].
Speaker 2: 'Stowage,' yes, 'Stowage,' now that, now that pinpoints the year for me; so I moved out of the factory in Newark [New Jersey] in '97 [1997] or '98  [1998] because I was there packing my stuff and cleaning up and I found a book on the shelf and it was called Ebony guide to Negro history ['A Layman's Guide to Negro History,' ed. Erwin A. Salk]. My mom [Jacqueline Epps Cole] had bought it when I was a kid and I, I still had it and I'm flipping through this book and I see a graphic of the Brookes slave ship, now at this same moment I'm cleaning out my studio and I've got all these ironing boards on the shelf and I say, "Man that ironing board could be a slave ship." And that's when I made that connection.
Speaker 1: It's a powerful piece.  This is--and, and you're using the scorched technique?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm using the iron imprint to represent the tribes because you know, you've got Proctor Silex, Sunbeam, Black and Decker, these are the tribes in the cult of the domestic, all of these tribes are named after these iron brands, so I imagine that the ironing board is the slave ship and the scorch mark is the tribal emblem of each of the brands, so that's how that came about.
Speaker 1: So the size of that piece is the size of the ironing board?
Speaker 2: Yeah, everything is, is actual, yes.  What I did was I embedded the real objects into a block of wood and printed from that.
Speaker 1: And how was that piece received?
Speaker 2: That piece was a life changing piece.  It was well received.  That piece led to me having my first one person show at a major museum, the Museum of Modern Art [New York, New York] and that piece--
Speaker 1: The very next year, '98 [1998].
Speaker 2: --is, is kind of like a signature piece for me because people always ask about it and it was a small run but most of the major museums have it, so it was really--I call it my thesis piece because I didn't go to graduate school, but yeah it was life changing.
Speaker 1: And that show, at MoMA was in '98 [1998], right?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure, in ninety--'99 [1999].
Speaker 1: And so you then are reviewed by The New York Times--
Speaker 2: And I'd been reviewed before of course.
Speaker 1: By The Times?
Speaker 2: Yeah The Times, every time I had a show at the, like I've been with the Brooke Alexander Gallery [New York, New York] I think since 1990 or '91 [1991], so every show I've had there has been reviewed up to this day.
Speaker 1: And you say it, you say it changed your life, is it based upon exposure, what, what, what's the change that's happening?
Speaker 2: I would say, well, sense of self because it was the Museum of Modern Art which is kind of like a dream come true at that time for me and like now I get invited to do prints at studios all over the country and that's the result of that piece.  People call me a printmaker and, and I never used that term before then and I rarely use it now, but the invitations keep coming and I got to speak at the, at some big printmaking conference in New Orleans [Louisiana] and all that came because of that piece.
Story_ID: 665516
Speaker 1: Did--during your, during this period, did you interact at all with Bob Blackburn [Robert Blackburn]?
Speaker 2: I didn't inter- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The national printmaker?
Speaker 2: --interact with Bob Blackburn as a printmaker, but he was at SVA [School of Visual Arts, New York, New York] when I was there and I didn't take printmaking at SVA, but I knew him from there, so this big circle again, so when I was [HistoryMaker] Willie Cole running the Works Gallery [Newark, New Jersey], I wanted to do a show of black artists from previous generations, I went to Bob and he gave me prints by Benny Andrews and Ed Clark [HistoryMaker Edward Clark] and Herbert Gentry to show (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh my goodness.
Speaker 2: So.
Speaker 1: Fantastic, so you, you certainly knew him?
Speaker 2: So I knew him, yes.
Story_ID: 665517
Speaker 1: In '99 [1999] you create 'Man Spirit Mask' [Willie Cole]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What's that piece?
Speaker 2: 'Man Spirit Mask,' can't quite recall the inspiration, but you know, my sketchbook is a lot of writing, a lot of words so I probably saw those three words together and decided to make a piece where I would be the man.
Speaker 1: So is it a self-portrait just photographed right?
Speaker 2: Yes in a way it's a self-portrait, you know.  I, I think that year and maybe a few years after that I did a lot of photographic work using the computer and that was because one, I felt I should be a computer wiz since I use to be in that industry, but then also because I'd become better acquainted with Cindy Sherman, we were on the board of Artists Space [New York, New York] together and I was very aware of Matthew Barney.  I said, "Now these two people get, they've got so much presence in the art world and they're doing photographs of themselves so maybe I should put my own image in my work." So 'Man Spirit Mask' was the first of that.
Speaker 1: When you were on the board with Cindy Sherman did you, did you talk about your creative process?
Speaker 2: No we just talked about Artists Space business pretty much.  She had a couple of partners that are at her plays that I attended but I never really got to talk to her like, anything deep like that.
Speaker 1: And she's one of the ones who has certainly--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --taken that art form and blown up with it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In, in, in this piece you--there's a photograph of you where you--the tribal markings of you, are they painted on the photograph?
Speaker 2: No, no, it's embossed from the steam iron.  We made, yeah we made a--
Speaker 1: On the photograph?
Speaker 2: --plate of the--you know you take the iron and photograph, you blow it up to the size of the page you want and you make a plate so you can emboss the scorch patterns; so that's the Proctor Silex scorch, so my tribe is the Silex in the scenario anyway; so as a Silex warrior I had to have the Silex scarification, so that's how that comes about.
Speaker 1: So you really studied these--
Speaker 2: Well, just you know, just--
Speaker 1: --the irons?
Speaker 2: --like they say, take it as far as you can, you know and then when you can't take it any further you just ride it and see how far it goes (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well I, I watched a film; I think maybe it was on a news show where you were teaching the scorching technique.
Speaker 2: Right, that was Kentucky Public Television [Kentucky Educational Television], maybe.
Speaker 1: And, and it was really fascinating because you talked about the, the intensity of the heat--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and, and the depth with which--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the scorching would go which is quite deep actually.
Speaker 2: Right
Speaker 1: What, what was the material that you were scorching?
Speaker 2: It was just paper.  We had a watercolor sketchpad that we used for the demonstration.
Speaker 1: When I watch that what immediately comes to mind is branding.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that was rushed too because I let the iron get very, very hot, but that was TV, it's timed so we had to take it as it was.
Speaker 1: But it did go a, a number of layers?
Speaker 2: It did, it did, but see nowadays I do a lot of wood so I use a forge so my iron gets red hot, even pink hot, so I can do like a whole, like an eight by eight [inch] surface in maybe (gesture) just two heatings (laughter).
Speaker 1: Because, right, you're heating it differently (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's so hot. Yeah.
Story_ID: 665518
Speaker 1: You do another artist in residence in Sheboygan, Wisconsin?
Speaker 2: Sheboygan, Sheboygan, yes, the Kohler (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is John Michael Kohler Arts Center?
Speaker 2: Right, the Kohler Arts Center there.
Speaker 1: So then are you living there for this period of time?  How does that work?
Speaker 2: I, I was there for, I'm not sure how--it was long, but I was not, I was living there, but my family was still here, so I would catch a flight home quite often, like maybe every--once a month or something like that.
Speaker 1: This is in 2000?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Is your work at affected by 9/11 [September 11, 2001]?
Speaker 2: Maybe it was in 9/11, that year, 'cause when 9/11 occurred I, I had just had a one person show at the Bronx Museum [Bronx Museum of the Arts, Bronx, New York].  The year before I had met this artist in Florida who was from New York [New York] and he worked at the Bronx Museum as an art handler, so we had scheduled for me to come to his studio on 9/11 to look at his work and his studio was one of the buildings that came down, so that awareness, that memory of him affects me a bit, you know just makes me--the whole world now is just so crazy, but that experience led me to make a piece called 'Malcolm's Chicken' [Willie Cole] because you know, Malcolm [Malcom X] asked by the journalist what do you think about the assassination of President Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] and Malcolm said, "It's a case of chickens coming home to roost."  So I thought that 9/11 was a same kind of thing and I still do, you know, I mean the U.S. exports terrorism all around the world, so whether it was coincidence, which it was not, or whether it was deliberate it's still chickens coming home to roost.  It's what we send out has now come back to haunt us, whether we orchestrated it or whether we just inspired it.  So I made two chickens out of matches.  They are basically firebombs.  I carved them out of styrofoam and glued layers of matches all around them, so they're like this big piece, so that was 9/11 inspired.  I also did a piece that year called 'Suicide Virgins' [ph.] where I got a statue of the Virgin Mary and I, her garment I think was maybe blue and white so I made the blue part became a firecrackers, so she was wearing a vest made of firecrackers, so, that was about it for my 9/11-ness.  I feel that black artists are expected to be political and but white artists are not, so I also have feelings about what you focus on becomes your life, so I don't always want to focus on the negative things in life or the things that are so disturbing, I mean I don't want to live in a bubble, but I believe that I'm shaping my own reality with my thoughts, so I can't focus on that stuff too long; but I know when the first Gulf War broke out I felt that I was lost in personal mythology and I made pieces related to the war for the first year in that war.
Story_ID: 665519
Speaker 1: And now I've been invited to be in a show about this Trumpness [President Donald John Trump], you know, but--
Speaker 2: Are you going to do it?
Speaker 1: Well, I've made two pieces just for Facebook, I'm going to just show those.  I made a video for Facebook which was pretty much the moment where the Obamas [Michelle Obama and HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] are waiting for the Trumps to pull up in a car and they welcome them to the White House then you know, wave to the camera.  I took that and I mixed it with Barbra Streisand 'Send In The Clowns,' but I balanced it just right so when Barbra says (singing), "Making my entrance again," the Obamas step out the front door and then when they say (singing), "But isn't it rich," Trump pulls up, the door opens (laughter) and then when in the end when it says (singing), "Where are the clowns, don't bother they're here," Trump is on the steps waving, so I'm going to give them that piece and then I made a piece that was Santa Claus spanking Trump, whether he's naughty or nice, so I'm going to give them those two piece 'cause it's, it's an instant show.  They just thought of it. I just found out yesterday they want the pieces by tomorrow, so--
Speaker 2: So you have, you've already made them.
Speaker 1: --so I had those in the computer, so I'm just going to send them those.
Story_ID: 665520
Speaker 1: I want to ask you--for many artists supplement their income through teaching, is that something that you've done in your career?
Speaker 2: No, no because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I don't see that.
Speaker 2: --you know it's like (pause) a baby wants to learn how to walk.  They practice they walk, you know.  They, I mean the parents give them a walker to help them out, but without that walker the baby will still learn to walk, you know 'cause it has the faith that it will eventually walk just as everybody else around them walks, so I was kind of that way about it, you know, I didn't go to school to become an art teacher.  I wanted to be an artist, a full-time artist, so.
Speaker 1: And, and as I mentioned earlier, there have been many grants and different prizes--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that you have received including--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in 2006 you received the David C. Driskell Prize--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --at the High Museum of Art [Atlanta, Georgia], which is the--?
Speaker 2: The first artist to receive it [sic.].
Speaker 1: Yes, can you describe what that prize is and what it meant to you?
Speaker 2: Well it meant acknowledgement from the black faction of the art world.  It meant a connection to [HistoryMaker] David Driskell and--
Speaker 1: And, and say a little bit about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and monetarily it wasn't, it wasn't a great thing monetarily.  I think they gave me thirty thousand dollars, but it was an honor to be honored you know.  I have a friend who wrote a poem years ago like in the '70s [1970s] about that honor without using that name, that one day I would be honored by, by a community of proud African scholars and intellectuals--
Speaker 1: Describe--
Speaker 2: --so that's what I was.
Speaker 1: --David Driskell and his, his importance?
Speaker 2: Well David Driskell as I know him and I didn't know him well as an artist, but I knew him mostly through the center that he used to be a professor at the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] and he was Dave--he was Bill Cosby's art, what do you call it, art adviser. I--
Speaker 1: And Cosby built a huge art center for him [David C. Driskell Center for the Study of the Visual Arts and Culture of African Americans and the African Diaspora].
Speaker 2: Yes and I recognized that he was very, very respected in the arts community.  I know that he does a lot of great printmaking.  One prize was to receive one of his prints as well, but for me David Driskell is just a model of how a black man can become great and respected in the art world because he's a great guy.  Now I don't know his career trajectory as an artist, but I know that he wears the banner of being an art scholar and you know when I received that award we went to his hometown [Eatonton, Georgia] so, he comes from a small town.  His dad [G.W. Driskell] was the minister.  We went to his old church where he went to as a boy.  He played the piano in church.  When we got our group there from the High Museum we'd get on a big bus and go to his church and he's wearing a medal, presidential medal of honor, some years he was wearing that around his neck (laughter), so we all go into this church and everybody's glad to see him and he makes a speech, a short speech and he says, "I want to give you all a gift." And he sits down and starts playing the piano and singing so that just blew me away.  I said this--I want to be like this old man here.
Story_ID: 665521
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Well let's talk about that for a minute because in addition to, to painting and sculpture you also play music?
Speaker 1: I do play music.  I want to play music now in my life because it doesn't have any pressure.  It's not related to making money or anything it's just love.
Speaker 2: What do you play?
Speaker 1: I play the guitar, but I have played the flute and the piano in my life.  When I was in high school [Arts High School, Newark, New Jersey] I had played the tuba for the marching band but I didn't play it long because at fourteen years old I fell in love with a young girl (laughter) and the only time I could spend with her was the same time that I had my tuba lessons, so I dropped the tuba so I could spend that time with her (laughter).
Speaker 2: And the other instruments--it's always a girl, right?
Speaker 1: But I played the flute when I was in college because I have a friend who plays the saxophone, it's a longer story than that, but I had a friend who was a great piano player, Joseph Davis [ph.], he passed away years ago and I traded him a flute.  He had the flute.  I had a pair of blue suede platform sandals that he wanted so we traded (laughter), this is at Boston U [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts], you know.  So I began to practice the flute and I carried it everywhere.
Speaker 2: And you taught yourself?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I taught myself because I, you know I had listened to a lot of music.  I have a good ear for music, so I'm able to play along with records and stuff like that, but then my other friend I mentioned, Bill Penn [ph.] was a great sax player so he would do these jam sessions at all the jazz clubs and he would encourage me to do it with him, so I tried it.  They, nobody booed me off the stage, but I knew I sounded horrible, you know it like (snaps fingers) just trying to keep up, so I did that.  And we took--I took classes at the Jazzmobile [Jazzmobile Inc.] in Harlem [New York, New York] for two summers too.  I had Mario Rivera and Dave Valentin as my flute teachers.
Speaker 2: And this was around what year?
Speaker 1: This was in the '70s [1970s], somewhere between '75 [1975] and '79 [1979], two summers at Jazzmobile.
Speaker 2: And then the guitar and the piano.
Speaker 1: I've had a, I've had a guitar my whole life I got my first guitar when The Beatles came to the U.S., they were on Ed Sullivan ['The Ed Sullivan Show'].  The next day I said, "Dad [Willie Cole, Sr.], I've got to have a guitar," so my mom [Jacqueline Epps Cole] went to the pawnshop the next day and bought me an electric guitar.
Speaker 2: And did you have formal, formal lessons?
Speaker 1: I didn't have lessons; well I had lessons then for about two weeks because I was left handed and in that community my teacher at the, at the, I forget what the name of the school was, but he said, "We can't teach you because you're left handed." So I didn't get any lessons, but throughout my life up to this day I probably had three different teachers and about five years ago I started taking classical lessons, I did that for maybe three or four years and when I was in the, when I was at the University of Delaware [Newark, Delaware] I took piano lessons and at the University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia] I took guitar lessons.

Speaker 1: Now many artists combine video, painting, music, you know the, the--we are in a multi-media culture right now more than ever before--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, true.
Speaker 1: --not that it wasn't done before, but now it's much easier, just like you described the thing that you made for Facebook because it's easy to do that.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Have you incorporated your music into your art?
Speaker 2: I have but not in a big way, again it's about the marketing though, you know it's about the marketing.  My dealer [Brooke Alexander] is not, doesn't see me that way, so she doesn't encourage it.  She has, she has called some of my other interests distractions (laughter) but I have done these things long before I knew her so I still do them.
Speaker 1: Okay, so to her point, being your dealer for a long time?
Speaker 2: Yes, since 1990.
Speaker 1: So from 1990 now we're at 2017, as a working artist you have described that you are not doing other things so you make a living solely as a working artist, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  Well you could say I do a lot of show and tell.  Nowadays I'm invited to give lectures all over the country.  In fact, starting February the 11th I'm going to be probably on the road until around April 1st lecturing at museums and colleges, show and tell you know, I made this this year, I made this that year, this means this, this means that, so I, I've been doing a lot of that since 2005.
Speaker 1: Well, and, and it's tricky to the point of marketing and, and potentially marginalizing all the things that you do, while at the same time there are many fine artists who are not able to sustain themselves.
Speaker 2: True, that's true; well you know I live 100 percent on faith.  I don't worry about anything.  I say to myself God didn't put me here to suffer.  This talent is a blessing not a curse; don't sweat it.
Speaker 1: And you continue to make the other things (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So even when it looks, it looks, when it looks bleak--
Speaker 1: What--right.
Speaker 2: --I don't worry about it.
Speaker 1: And, and you continue to make whatever creative, creativity tells you to do--
Speaker 2: True.
Speaker 1: --along with the things that are part of the brand, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well this is my year to do, to make those other things the most important things because my dealer in New York [New York] is not selling as big as she was like three years ago, so I feel that I've got the space to do other things now.
Story_ID: 665523
Speaker 1: You've been working with plastics, plastics, plastic water bottles (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Plastic water bottles, that's right.
Speaker 1: When did you start doing that?
Speaker 2: I started that about three or four years ago.
Speaker 1: So that would be around 2014?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And how did that begin?
Speaker 2: Well in New Jersey there's a place called Grounds for Sculpture [Hamilton, New Jersey].  It's a big outdoor sculpture park.  They had three buildings with galleries inside and I was invited to do a show there, a one person show, so in my mind I thought it was an outdoor show, but when I had the meeting they wanted me to be inside in one of the galleries, so then I say, "Well, is there a budget for this show?" And they say there's no budget, so that's how I came to water bottles.  During that meeting I was drinking a bottle of water and the next day I'm at a friend's house in Union, New Jersey, Ted Davis [ph.], sitting by his pond drinking water and I'm squeezing the bottle and I'm realizing all these lines and ribs on the bottle, on bottles like the one I have, they are to make the bottles collapsible so I can manipulate the image of the bottle by manipulating these lines.  I was able to make a fish, so I'm looking at the fish in his pond so that kind of led me to make a fish.  That night I dreamed about a chandelier made of the water bottles and there was a Buddha in every bottle, so that's what I made for that show ['From Water to Light'], the Buddha chandelier.  It just started from there.  It played in well for me because of my interest in health and the environment, but also because a few years earlier I'd received an award for recycling from this county, Morris County, New Jersey because of my work with the shoes and the irons they saw me as a recycler, so now I'm really recycling something that affects the environment.
Story_ID: 665524
Speaker 1: I want to talk a bit more about the plastics.  So you--that exhibition ['From Water to Light'] was with the chandelier?
Speaker 2: Right, and that first show of bottles--I (unclear) the sculpture in New Jersey.  It was a twelve foot, twelve by twelve square on the ceiling and hanging down another ten feet were bottles, so it was thousands of bottles and there's a picture of Buddha in each bottle, but at that same show there was also a car made out of bottles and those are my first two bottle pieces.
Speaker 1: And since that time you've done a lot of bottle manipulation and some pieces that are figurative?
Speaker 2: Yes, one sets the evolution, just you know it's, it's all the same journey with each object.  You start with one thing and then you discover something else to that process, or something else discovers you.
Speaker 1: And then talk about the painting with the bottles because they're, they're a couple of pieces that I've seen that--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --remind me of the daisies with the shoes?
Speaker 2: Right, right, well I think maybe it's just certain things become a part of a person, so maybe there is a part of me that's a flower, I don't know (laughter), you know a flower energy from being that generation with the flower power and peace and love and, and females and flowers, but when I was in Hawaii maybe two years ago at the University of Hawaii [University of Hawaii at Hilo, Hilo, Hawaii] doing a print and the director of that art department took me to visit a friend of his who lived on this hill overlooking the ocean [Pacific Ocean], it was beautiful, I mean it was so high up that the street had a barricade front, in front of it and a guard but only one car could go down at a time because the hill was like this steep (demonstrates); but her property was covered with beautiful flowers and it inspired me and it, and I saw it as bottles.  So the print I ended up doing in Hawaii was a print of bottles so I crushed the bottles and I put them on a light table and then I photographed it down so you can see all the cracks and lines in the bottle, the drops of water in a bottle and the words on the bottle; so when I came home I said, I want to make this as a real 3D [three dimensional] piece. So I started attempting to do that and it still involved crushing the bottles, putting them in a mold with resin so they all stay together and the, the heat of the resin kind of makes the bottle lock in the shape that it developed through the crushing, but what I'm doing now is I'm painting them and that's what you see in the studio now is the painting.
Speaker 1: What kind of paint are you using?
Speaker 2: I'm using spray paint. Rust-Oleum makes a paint for plastic, but I am--because the first one I did which was showed at the gallery in New York, I sprayed them solid yellow but then I got an acrylic marker and I tried to draw on it and it looked like bananas instead of flowers.  The gallery showed it, they didn't sell it. But maybe about two months ago it just came to me to do the way I'm doing it now, so I take a, like a dowel, I put a wire on the end of it and I make a pattern with the wire so now I hold that wire against the bottle while I spray it, so I get the shapes that I want without using a brush and still using just spray paint and each one so far is just two colors so I may spray the whole thing red and then stencil and start spraying white and then come back with red and go back and forth until I get something that I like, so that's--
Speaker 1: So the plastics is, is that what's holding your attention right now the most, in, in creating art?
Speaker 2: Well the, the pieces that I have here now and this is February 3rd is suppose to be finished at the end of the year, but I still want to finish them before I move on, so recently a couple days ago I had a vision in my mind of Jeff Koons' big dog made out of flowers ['Puppy'], and I said to myself, no I can make it out of bottles; so I go online and I'm looking at dogs and I realize the Welsh Terrier can be made out of bottles, so I plan to make a Welsh Terrier out of bottles.  I should just say for anybody who's really listening in detail that the bottle pieces are the first pieces that I've made that I actually think about what I'm going to make 'cause a lot of the bottle work, especially the chandeliers and the cars are just mathematical equations you know, I get a schematic for a car, divide it by the size of the bottle so the Cadillac is fifteen feet long, the bottle is eight and a half inches long so I divide it by how many I need.
Speaker 1: So it's a different approach than you've had (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's a different approach, yeah. So my assistants can make these pieces for me.
Speaker 1: I was going to ask you that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so whether you're working alone or with support?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  With the bottle pieces up until this year, I worked with three assistants.  Their job was to prepare the bottles for me.  So we basically make sheets of bottles.  You take the bottle, you put a hole in each end of it and you thread it onto long wires, so now I have tons of these long strips of bottles, so I lay them side by side like this way (demonstrates) and now I sew across them like weaving so I end up with this sheet of bottles and I can shape it anyway I want to make anything.
Speaker 1: And that your assistants--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --can help you with doing that?
Speaker 2: Yes, they do that, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you say you had three assistants up until this year.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Are you working with assistants now?
Speaker 2: Not currently because currently I'm doing things that are more of my other interests and loves, you know I'm drawing cartoons and writing stories and things like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well--
Story_ID: 665525
Speaker 1: You've created a, a character--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to, for animation?
Speaker 2: Yes, maybe about three years ago I was making bronze sculptures out of shoes.  I'd make the thing out of real shoes then I would have it enlarged in bronze, so in that process I made one that looked like it wanted to fly so right away I knew it was a ShooFly and that--so I made a cartoon of it that year. Actually I hired a professional digital artist to make a digital animation of it and I want to take it--
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: This was about maybe three years ago and I've been, and I want to take it further so I've, I've consulted with a good friend of mine who can make that connection for me and she suggested that I try to brand the character myself first, by making a children's story and a book and those kind of things, so that's what I'm doing with it now.
Speaker 1: And for ShooFly?
Speaker 2: For ShooFly, yes.  And the ShooFly is a little bug that gets in your ear that makes you want to buy more shoes (laughter).
Speaker 1: Every woman's dream.
Speaker 2: Since I've been making art out of the shoes I buy a lot of shoes too, which I find very interesting too.  I never had more than two pairs of shoes, but now, man I've got so many shoes it's crazy (laughter).
Speaker 1: Would you ever consider doing this shoe sculpture with men shoes?
Speaker 2: No, the men shoes are not as interesting as the women shoes.  I made two pieces where the men's shoe was the foundation because I needed something big to hold the figure up and I used men's shoes for that, but no, not much these days.
Story_ID: 665526
Speaker 1: As you look at your career and you know it's varied because you've done a lot of different things in your artistic career. What is the legacy that you hope to leave?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm very interested in inspiring, well I guess anybody, but specifically my family members because you know, my sister [Debra Cole (ph.)] was the first one in the family to go to college, I was number two.  My family lived on a certain economic level.  I've broken that level and just sense of freedom that you don't have to be granted freedom, that you can just take it and run with it, so that's what I want to show people and it's worked among my family, my kids; my stepson wanted to be a rock star and it was challenging for me (laughter) but he went to college for one year and then he dropped out because he wanted to just play music and he did that for years.  He had a good time.  He got on TV, 'America's Got Talent' and all that stuff, but he never got a big record deal, but he told me that he did that because his whole life he saw me doing what I wanted to do; so now he still plays music and enjoying it, he's been able to separate it from, from monetary pressure, he does it for love now.  So it could still lead to a bigger picture for him.
Speaker 1: Has he figured out work that is sustainable for him?
Speaker 2: Well, he's moved to Vermont now.  He's living a whole different kind of life, so I'm not sure what he's going to do.  He's teaching guitar now though, but he grew up hearing me play guitar every night for his little sisters in their bedroom, so he decided he wanted to do that, so that the legacy is just an example of freedom and great expression.
Story_ID: 665527
Speaker 1: Do you have any regrets?
Speaker 2: I have and I mean it's a, it's a, it's a funny regret that I wish I'd never stopped those tuba lessons (laughter).
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Because here I am like fifty years later, I don't have the girlfriend anymore that's, (laughter), nor do I have the tuba experience.  If I'd learned that tuba back in those days my life, actually if I'd learned the tuba back in those days I'd probably be a jazz musician today rather than a visual artist 'cause I love music that much and I think that jazz is the highest creative calling on earth right now, you know, I mean you look at Coltrane [John Coltrane], Pharoah Sanders, when they're playing their music they're not playing their music, they're involved in some deep spiritual event, you know and I trace it back to like, the Bible says, in the beginning there was a word, that tells me that sound is where everything began, you know, doesn't matter whether the word said you know, green, or man or woman, or God, but it was the sound, sound, sound initiates a vibration.  People think that vibration is sound, but I think it's the other way around, you know.  And so I would have had that awareness at that age and I'd be doing that now, you know.  I'd still be making visual art too, but my primary creative interest would be in, in jazz and classical music.
Story_ID: 665528
Speaker 1: For young African American males or females who may want to become fine artists today, what advice do you have for them?
Speaker 2: Well first I would say look at your life as it is now and just like in the financial industry your advisor will say what is your risk tolerance, ask yourself that question first (laughter) and if you're willing to like take a big risk, then you're more likely to have success.  If you take a total leap on faith because that leap on faith will begin to program you to believe that that's who you are, not as opposed to that's who I want to become, but that's who I am, you know it's like back in the, in the '70s [1970s], better yet, back in the '80s [1980s] when I lost my computer graphics job and unemployment had run out I had to think to things like, to keep myself going.  My mom [Jacqueline Epps Cole] would call me and say, "You have any interviews today, did that man call back, did you get the job?" All that kind of stuff and I wasn't going on interviews, so I had to convince her that I was self-employed, so I would say now 'cause, I would say like, okay, so I need $100 today, how can I get it and I'd just break it down.  I can sell ten pieces for ten dollars a piece you know, I'd just break it down.  I can sell two pieces for fifty bucks [dollars] a piece until I got to a number that I felt comfortable with and then I would just pursue it and I pretty much still do the same thing today, you know.  So yes, it's a leap on faith and you have to nourish that faith everyday by thinking of, thinking logically about how you can reach the goal.
Speaker 1: Is there anything you'd like to share that I have not asked?
Speaker 2: Well you've asked so much that I think that I, I'll take this opportunity to just to be silent (laughter) and say thank you.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Thank you.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Story_ID: 665529
Speaker 1: This photo shows one of my first events at the Works Gallery [Newark, New Jersey] and from left to right that is Mr. Curtis Young [ph.] on the left, that's my mom's second husband; that's my mom in the middle with the Afro,
Speaker 2: Say her name.
Speaker 1: Jacqueline--nowadays she's got a lot of names, I don't know which I say.
Speaker 2: At that time--
Speaker 1: Jacqueline Young [Jacqueline Epps Cole] (laughter); that's me back there with the hairdo, [HistoryMaker] Willie Cole and that's my sister Debra Chernower [Debra Cole (ph.)] on the right.
Speaker 2: And about what time is this?
Speaker 1: I believe this is probably like 1983 or '84 [1984].
Speaker 2: Okay, this photo was taken in Georgia.  I'm not sure of the exact location, but the woman sitting down is my great-grandmother, her name is Eva Mae Johnson [ph.] and on her lap is my aunt, whose name is Olivia, at that time her name would have been Olivia Groce and the little girl on my left is my aunt, Bernise [Bernise Groce] and the one on the right is my grandmother, Christine Groce [Christine Groce Epps].
Speaker 1: This a photograph taken at my grandmother's house in Somerville, New Jersey.  The woman on my left is my grandmother, in that photo her name is Christine Peterson [ph.] and that's my sister, Debra Cole in the middle and the elder woman on the right is my great-grandmother, Miss Eva Mae Johnson; so that's all blood there, mother, daughter, mother, daughter.
Speaker 2: And these, these are my parents.  That's--the woman is Jacqueline Cole and the man is Willie Cole [Willie Cole, Sr.].
Speaker 1: And this is about what time?
Speaker 2: I don't know, is there a date on the back maybe?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: It's an old photograph.  It's got to be from the early '60s [1960s] I would say.
Speaker 1: This photo shows my mother and my aunt.  On the left that's my aunt, Katherine [ph.] and on the right is my mother, Jacqueline and the year--
Speaker 2: They're about how old?
Speaker 1: I'll go with whatever your guess is.  I mean if she's, she's like eighty now, so, what was she, five?
Speaker 2: Probably.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This year, what year was that?  This might have been, this might have been in the '70s [1970s], but I took a lot of classes at the Tree of Life Bookstore [New York, New York], so this is the group of people from the Tree of Life Bookstore who were studying herbology with Dr. John Moore, that's him on the right at the top and he'd take us out into Central Park [New York, New York] and we'd just studied all the wild plants in Central Park; so that's me in the middle with my bag of mullein and other plants that I had picked that day in Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: This photo is an excerpt from a photo shoot for Vanity Fair magazine.  And the shoot was celebrating the anniversary of the Artists Space gallery in Manhattan [New York] and I forget what year they were celebrating, but everybody there is an artist you probably know, I mean from here I can see the guy on the right is Chuck Koontz [ph.], next to him is Jeff Koons, and that's me on the left at the top in the back.
Speaker 1: This is probably 1989 or '90 [1990] and after doing the scorches in Harlem so now I'm here and I was trying to do an installation called 'Ten Thousand Mandelas,' so I cut out these cardboard Mandelas to the Mandelas are all around me, but because I was so involved in scorch, they said, "Can you put a scorch in the background?" So that's why the scorch is there (laughter).
Speaker 2: And this is me working on, on the Mandelas, gluing the faces on.
Speaker 1: And can you describe what, that project--?
Speaker 2: I had a slogan in my mind that we were all Mandelas, so for that year and probably the year after that, that became my work and I did cutouts of Nelson Mandela in various situations.  So in this project I made like maybe ten thousand or more cutouts of Mandela out of cardboard, found cardboard and Xeroxed faces of Mandela on the cardboard.  Each one was numbered and we put them all around SoHo [New York, New York] and the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York] in that year.
Speaker 1: And what year was that?
Speaker 2: That year might have been 19--maybe 1988, I'm not sure of the year exactly.  It was before Mandela was released.
Speaker 1: And this is me in 1972 doing a painting of my great-grandfather, Reverend Charles H. Groce [Charles Groce]; so there are two paintings of him there, the little one in the background and the big one upfront.  I made that for his church and you know when he died they gave it back to me, which I thought was strange, so I have it now (laughter).
Speaker 2: This is the announcement card for the first exhibition at the Works Gallery.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: And what year was that?
Speaker 1: That's a good question.  I would say, again I can base it on my hair.  That was probably, probably 1985 (laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: I think this is either 1998 or 1999, but this is me receiving a recycling award from the Morris County recycling commission [Morris County Municipal Utilities Authority].
Speaker 2: That's great, that is great.
Speaker 1: This is my sister and I and I believe we're in Newark [New Jersey], or we might actually be in Bound Brook [New Jersey], I'm not really sure where we are, but that's little big head days; that's probably--
Speaker 2: Nine, ten--?
Speaker 1: Okay, I'll go with that (laughter).
Speaker 2: Now, this one here I was probably younger, but we would visit my cousin in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, so that's me on the left in the red jacket, my sister, Debra Cole in the middle and my cousin, Judy Anderson [ph.] on the right and--
Speaker 1: And whose car is that?
Speaker 2: --that's her, her father's car, Uncle Ernie's [ph.] car, yeah.
Speaker 1: This is me as, as a radio deejay.  I worked at a closed circuit radio station in the Times Square area [New York, New York].  I forget the call letters for it now, but it was connected to a school and they gave each student a show, so that was my day to have my show.
Speaker 2: Do you know when that was?
Speaker 1: Yes, that was probably 1973 maybe.
Speaker 2: This is me in my first trip to Europe, I'm in Amsterdam [the Netherlands] there and what year would that have been--'88 [1988], this might have been 1985 or '86 [1986].
Story_ID: 665530
Speaker 1: This is high school graduation [from Arts High School, Newark, New Jersey], so that would have been 1972.
Speaker 2: Now this might actually be my first, what I thought of as my first exhibition (laughter) so, this is Art in the Park in Paterson, New Jersey.  I want to point out some, point a couple of things.  These are all paintings that I did as a student in school.  This is Frank Perdue riding a chicken.  This is what I thought would be my first album cover, it's called 'Bluebird Singing the Blues' [ph.], a little bird playing the guitar there and I was writing stories about health and nutrition.  This was my character whose name was Moshe [ph.], so I made him as a puppet as well as a children's book.  He was a big hit at that event.
Speaker 1: And what year was this?
Speaker 2: And this is Stanley Clarke, the bass player.  I tried to set it as a high times.  I wrote a story about marijuana, I called something about roaches, so this--I still have that painting, that's what that's about.  This landscape I did in the park locally.  And this was my first business card, so it's a, a white boy holding a sneaker, a giant sneaker, but it was inspired by the story of Abebe Bikila, the barefoot runner, I forget--maybe the '64 [1964] marathon, he won barefoot.  His shoes came off after the first five miles; he continued.  So in my story the boy finds the shoe.
Speaker 1: And this was about what year?
Speaker 2: I think that's--
Speaker 1: Your first show--?
Speaker 2: --it's, I was in college then, so that's probably like in the '70s [1970s] I would say maybe '70 [1970], '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: And this, this is a band that I was in called Tough Duck [ph.] and we started in '72 [1972], but this photo might be from '73 [1973] or '74 [1974].  I don't remember this guy's name, but this is Anthony Durant [ph.] playing we were all guitar players, so it was crazy, but he played the guitar.  This was Floyd Russell Riley [ph.], he played guitar and that's me, I played guitar also.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And this is my second marathon I believe.  Let me see if there's a date on there; so this is either the New Jersey Marathon or the New York marathon [New York City Marathon] and what year was that?  Oh, I know it's, it's in the '80s [1980s], it's probably around 1983 or '4 [1984] I would say.
Speaker 2: And so, so that's the second marathon, that one.  This was the first marathon 'cause this is the Jersey marathon and this is probably, I've still got the years all wrong based on my hair because I couldn't look like that when I had my job, my computer job, so this is probably '84 [1984] and that one is probably '83 [1983].
Speaker 1: This, this is, this is in seventh grade so, this is, must be 1966
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  All right
Speaker 2: And you see my record collection?
Speaker 1: Yup (laughter).
Speaker 2: James Brown at the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York] right in front there (laughter).
