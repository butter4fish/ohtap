We   re in Asher, Oklahoma, to speak with Fay and Blanche Hudson. This  is part of our 100 Year Life Project, and we   re with Oklahoma State  University, so thank you for having us today. Let   s start with having you  tell us when and where you were born.  Two, twenty-seven, fourteen, Trousdale, Oklahoma.  Okay, and where did you go to school?  I started at Adell in 1920, a little schoolhouse over here about a mile,  stayed one year and then moved over to the other, so I went to school  three-quarters of a mile north of here, Adell.  And how would you get there?  Walked.  Walked. (laughs)  It was always a mile and a quarter.  Would you go even in bad weather?  All the time. I didn   t miss. I   ve had ice froze on my clothes.  How many other kids were in the classroom with you?  How many kids in school with me?  Yes.  5  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Gray  Oh, probably forty.  All different ages?  One through eight.  Was it a one-room? Was it one room?  Two-room. I started in a one-room and went two years, and then I went  to a two-room.  What would you take for lunch?  What I took for lunch?  Yes.  I took biscuits and sausage, sorghum molasses and butter and sweet  potatoes, all the good stuff.  Sounds pretty good to me. After the eighth grade, where did you go?  I went to Trousdale High School.  And graduated in what year?  Thirty-two.  Thirty-two. Did you have a favorite subject?  Yes, geography, agriculture.  Were your parents farmers?  Yes.  What did they raise?  Cotton, corn, oats, maize.  And what were your chores? What did you have to do for your chores?  I had to milk cows, feed chickens.  I thought you had to plow the crops.  6  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Gray  Bishop  Gray  Bishop  F. Hudson  Blanche Hudson  Gray  F. Hudson  Bishop  Oh, yes I did, when I was seven years old.  With a horse or a tractor?  Horse. We didn   t have tractors. Horses and mules.  Do you remember their names?  Tate and Beck was our mules. Daisy and Maude was our mares. We  raised colts and sold them. That   s the way I went to college, was selling  the colts. My mother and dad separated when I was fifteen. I had to  make a living for the family, my brother and two sisters and my mother  and myself, on eighty acres of farm during the Depression, but we made  it.  Were you the oldest son?  No, my older brother was married and left home.  And left you in charge.  I was the sole survivor. I   ve had a family ever since I was fifteen.  Can you describe the house you grew up in?  Get that picture over there.  That   s Maude and Daisy, the horses.  Oh my gosh  Those are your horses?  They   re part of the family, I guess. They   re in the picture.  Were they a part of the family, the horses?  Yes.  Isn   t one of them his grandmother?  Yes. The lady sitting in the chair is his Grandmother Harmon, and the  dog   s name is Fred. (Laughter)  Fred.  Do you remember Fred?  7  F. Hudson  Bishop  F. Hudson  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  F. Hudson  Gray  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  Finchum  Yes.  What kind of dog was he?  Guard dog.  You ought to ask him about being a body guard before he started to  school.  For who?  For his brother, his older brother.  I understand you were a body guard for your older brother.  I was what?  A body guard, for Frank.  Yes, when he was going to school. When he started, I was three years  younger, but my mother sent me to school to keep the kids off of him.  Were you bigger than him?  No, I was meaner. (Laughter)  He never saw anything he was afraid of.  I took me a club, and nobody bothered. (Laughter)  What about the time in the hayfield? Somebody said something to you,  and you started after them, and they grabbed you. I   ve heard him tell it,  but I don   t remember how it went.  Whenever I was six years old, we   d get up early and do the chores, milk  the cows, separated the cream, shipped it to Guthrie. If we didn   t milk  the cows, we   d go to the cotton fields and pick cotton. When we come in  at night, we   d weigh up and go back to the field and pull bolls with a  burr. Then, you didn   t have bolls; you had to have clean cotton. We   d go  back to the field and pull the bolls and bring them to the house, and after  supper we   d pick the cotton out of the burrs, so we put in a full day.  And then some. What kind of light would you have to work by? Oil, I  guess?  8  Finchum  Gray  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Bishop  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Gray  F. Hudson  Gray  A lamp, kerosene lamp.  Did it just sit on the table, or was it hanging on the wall?  Sitting in the floor, close by where you was working.  Would you get paid for the work you did?  No. Food, clothes.  That   s better than pay.  Did your mother have a large garden?  Yes, yes. We raised everything we ate. Still do.  She did a lot of canning?  Yes. She canned meat and chicken, and we   d have anything to eat we  wanted anytime. Stuffed sausage. No problem on food ever. I was never  hungry in my life.  How did she do her laundry?  Rub board.  Rub board. And what about bath time?  Tub.  In the kitchen or on the porch?  Just wherever. (Laughter) Every Saturday whether you needed it or not.  Once a week?  Yes, yes.  He   s got a funny story, too, about a little red wagon that he tried to make  into a sleigh.  I started brushing my teeth when I was six years old with a rag and salt  and soda, and I   ve still got all my teeth but one. I had some fillings done  here the other day, and three fillings two weeks ago.  He just lost his first tooth when he was ninety-eight.  9  F. Hudson  Gray  Finchum  B. Hudson  Bishop  B. Hudson  Finchum  Gray  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Bishop  F. Hudson  Bishop  F. Hudson  Gray  F. Hudson  Still got them all.  But one.  That   s pretty amazing.  He always used salt and soda. I   d fix it up in some kind of a jar, but he  always used salt and soda.  Never used toothpaste?  He finally did. He does now, but for years he didn   t, no.  So after high school   well, you want to talk about the wagon.  Tell her about your little red wagon, and you trying to hook reindeer up  to it.  Oh. When I was a little kid, they   d had these ox team yokes made, and  pulled the plows on the prairies, early day. I thought,    Well, shoot, if  they can do it, I can do it.    I made me an ox yoke for a couple of calves,  and I had a new little red wagon. I hooked them to it, and that was the  last of my little red wagon. (Laughter) They stopped running, and there  wasn   t nothing left.  How did you have a red wagon to begin with?  Got it for me for Christmas.  So what were holidays like in your home?  Holidays?  Yes.  We had Christmas and Fourth of July.  Tell them about your Christmas tree. Tell them about how you fixed  your Christmas tree.  In the early day, all these cedars you see around here, taking the country,  there wasn   t a cedar tree in the country. There were no greenery of any  kind, so we   d have to go to the woods and get a little blackjack sapling  and take cotton and wrap cotton around the limbs, pick berries and string  them, popcorn and string it, put it on a little tree for Christmas. Didn   t  10  Finchum  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  Gray  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  Gray  F. Hudson  Gray  have any cedars then. Now them cedars are taking the country     They have.     ruining the land. Oklahoma will be nothing but a cedarville in twenty  more years.  I think there ought to be a law that they had to get rid of them.  Going to have to be some kind of law against cedars.  Well, after high school, what did you do?  Farmed and went to college.  Where did you go?  Ada.  Eastern?  East Central University.  I started teaching on a two-year certificate.  What did you teach?  One-room school.  So the subject, everything?  Every subject. Home-ec, I taught home-ec and had a girl who won a  ribbon at the state fair on an apron she made.  That you taught her how to make?  Yes.  Had your mother taught you? How did you learn?  Did your mother teach you how to sew?  Yes. I made a quilt. I think I still got it.  Yes, you have.  11  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Bishop  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  Gray  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  Were you involved with 4-H in high school?  Yes, that   s what put me through, 4-H Club.  Well, tell us when you met your wife, how and when.  Well, I went home with her brother from high school one day, and she  was there. We latched onto each other, and she was a baby. She didn   t  know any better, and I should have. (Laughs)  How old was she?  Probably ten. (Laughter)  Wasn   t that bad. (Laughter) Probably thirteen.  Twelve.  Maybe not over twelve.  Oh my gosh. (Laughs)  She was the prettiest girl in the country.  And still is.  Yes.  And how did you ask her to marry you?  Well, I don   t know whether I asked her or she asked me. (Laughs) She  was sitting on a sack of corn cobs behind a wood stove like this out here,  and I asked her. She said yes.  And did you ask her father?  No. Stole her. I went down to Sulphur, hitchhiked down there and got  the marriage license. We went down one day and got married, and  nobody knew it for a month or so.  How did you keep the secret that long?  We just courted.  Well, he went out of the county so he could get the marriage license.  That   s why he went to Sulphur     12  Finchum  B. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  Bishop  B. Hudson  Bishop  B. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  Bishop  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  And he hitchhiked?     because if he   d have got it in Shawnee, it   d have come out in the  paper.  But you guys didn   t live a month together before your dad came and got  you, did you?  Yes, after we   d been married a while, I decided just to go home with  him, and I left them a note, and my dad came and got me.  Her dad latched onto me and put me to work for him to do his chores. I  got ten dollars a month from him.  He told Fay, he said,    You come get her tomorrow like a man.    I told  Fay later, I said,    I didn   t know whether you   d come after me or not,     and he said,    You knew I   d come.    He came the next day and got me.  Well, how old were you when you got married?  Fifteen.  Fifteen, and how old was Fay?  Twenty-four, but that isn   t on our marriage license. He put me as  eighteen and him as twenty-two or -three. I don   t know how old he put.  I don   t know. I don   t know where your marriage license is.  I don   t know either.  It   s kind of like cooking the books. (Laughter)  I walked three miles and three-quarters, three miles to here and three-quarters  north, to where she went to school. It   s where I first started  teaching at a one-room school, Ivy.  Where I had gone to school. I wasn   t going then.  Got fifty dollars a month, and I did the janitor work, the cooking. That   s  where I learned to cook some things. I was put on a government  program. You   d get the commodities, and that was all you got. I put a  cup of beans on the stove for every kid I had. I got to school the next  morning; those beans were all over the floor. I had beans for everybody  in the community. (Laughter) That   s how I learned to cook.  13  Bishop  Gray  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  Enough for a fundraiser. (Laughter)  Exactly.  I had a lot of fun along the way.  He also cut their hair, pulled their teeth.  I had a little girl that was retarded, and I didn   t know what retarded was  then. She had no toes. She had toenails where her toes were supposed to  be, and she had three sets of teeth. I pulled seven teeth for her one day.  She had about a fourth-grade education. Moved to California, and she  went to work for an elderly lady out there, and when she died, she left  her her home.  Her hand was all together like that. (Gestures)  Her fingers?  No, her thumb was...  She didn   t have much of her fingers left, but she could write better than  some of them could who had good hands. We were going to take the  kids up to the state fair in the city, and she said she couldn   t go. I said,     How come?    She said,    They   ll make fun of me.    I said,    Who told  you that?    She said,    Mama.    When I got through with Mama that day,  she never did say it anymore. She went with us. A lot of people look  down on handicaps, and I wish I could take up for them. They   re the  ones that need the help. The other people don   t need the help.  They all need some, probably, but it   s terrible.  I had a handicap. Her mother brought her to school, wanted to know if  I   d take her. I said,    Yes, I   ll do all I can with her.    She enrolled, and her  sister and home-ec teacher came down to the gym where I was coaching  one day and said I should stop Nancy from going to school. I said,    How  come?    Says,    It embarrasses her sister.    I said,    If it embarrasses her  sister, her sister   s the one that needs to stay at home.     It didn   t embarrass her sister.  She went until she used up her twelve years.  Want to tell them about Bobby Deal?  14  Gray  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Gray  F. Hudson  Bishop  F. Hudson  Gray  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  Finchum  This was later in his teaching career.  Tell about Bobby Deal.  He was retarded, and he couldn   t control himself very well, kind of  walked with a dance. I got him a job as a dishwasher down at Ada,  Pendergrass Caf  . I went in there one day to see how he was doing, and  the owner said,    Well, I fired two college students the other day. They  couldn   t spell. Bobby can spell.    (Laughter)  Well, after teaching in the small school, did you go to a bigger one?  I went to high school, yes.  No, to teach.  I was an administrator but always taught at least three classes. I was  superintendent, and I taught three classes.  What were those classes, usually?  I taught biology, general science, history, geography, welding, wood-working,  whatever. I always had fun with the kids, teaching. Secretary  would do the pencil work.  He took them rattlesnake hunting, too.  I kept up with it.  I used to say he was a jack-of-all-trades and master of none. He told me  one time he didn   t want to hear me say that anymore.  I was principal of Wanette for thirteen years and they fired me. They got  a new superintendent, and he wanted to get rid of me because he was a  shyster. The board went along with him, and the next year, the state  pulled his certificate. He couldn   t even teach in Oklahoma. He tore some  building and houses down up at Tecumseh, hauled the lumber to his  farm in Eufaula. Took a truck motor and put it in his truck instead of  putting it in a school bus. After I was over at Asher that fourteen years,  they had eight superintendents, and they came to Asher wanting me to  come back to Wanette. I went back and stayed six years. They fired me  again. (Laughter) They got rid of a lot of money. One girl had to pay  back  110,000. Whole bunch of stuff. There   s lots of people running  crooked stuff in the school business.  Did they ask you back a third time?  15  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  Bishop  F. Hudson  Gray  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  No, I was too old.  If they had, would you have said no?  Let   s see. I was sixty-five, and they didn   t know it. (Laughter)  Well, and you went to work for Head Start, anyway.  I got my retirement and went to work for  Community Action  Head  Start next June the thirtieth. July the first, I was working for Action. I  worked for Action seventeen years, Shawnee. Head Start, Head Start  Handicap, then a senior citizens volunteer program. I stayed busy.  He never did have any trouble finding a job.  You ever have a lot of school kids come to your house?  Not very much, I had some. I had one girl working for me that was a  student of mine and had driver education. I taught driver ed twenty  years.  Well, you do have some kids that have come and visited you through the  years.  Oh yes, yes. We had fifty-four graduates at Wanette this last week and  last Sunday. I went, and they had about forty there.  He always doctored all the kids. You couldn   t do that now.  Some of them cute girls, I didn   t know them. (Laughter) It   d been too  long.  His nickname when he was in Wanette was Doc. They all called him  Doc because he doctored all the kids, and when he went to Asher, the  principal nicknamed him Fearless.  Let   s back up. In the   40s, did you stay in Oklahoma during the war?  No, I went to California in    42 and stayed four years. That   s where I  learned to teach welding. I was a welder in the shipyard for four years.  She welded, too.  You actually did welding work.  We were both welders.  16  Finchum  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  Finchum  B. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  And how did you learn?  He was a pipe welder, but I helped build the ships.  She welded more than I did. I was a pipe welder. I had to wait for  pipefitters to fit the pipe, and they were from Oklahoma, bakers and  candlestick makers, and they didn   t know how to fit pipe.  Were there very many other women with you working?  Oh yes, there was lots of them.  Was it a hard job?  I think there   s about thirty miles of pipe on one of them ships. The ship  was 520 feet long, 70 feet wide, troop transport. It   d hold 10,000 troops.  Wow.  We built ten of them.  When they started building them in the double bottoms, they welded  from the middle, up on one side, and from the bottom up to the middle  on the other side, and it  wasn   t solid . They decided that wouldn   t work.  It had to be solid. That   s where I went to work, the bottoms, welding.  That   s the way I really learned to weld. They put me out as  tacker , and  you would put a flange on a bulkhead and weld it so they could pick it  up. The first one they picked up, I was horrified because I thought that  would fall and no telling how many people it   d kill, but it didn   t fall.  After that I got a little confidence.  The toughest weld I ever had to make was on the mast, up on top of the  flagpole. It goes through a place not as big as this table but half as big,  and had a manhole that the pipe went down. It was welded to a plate  below and then had to be welded underneath the deck, and you had to  look in a mirror down here and weld up here. Tough weld.  I never would have made that.  Had one that had a two-inch gravity flow line, and once you get a wad of  metal on it, you can   t stop it unless you chip it. Chipper couldn   t get to  it. It was behind a door face. They came to me, and the men in the shift  wanted to know if I could stop it. I said,    I probably can,    so I burned a  hole in front of the pipe, welded the inside, and sewed it back up. The  foreman said,    It don   t leak. How   d you stop that?    I told him, and he  17  Finchum  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  Finchum  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Bishop  B. Hudson  said,    Hell, anybody ought to have thought of that.    (Laughter) Because  there wasn   t no way you could chip it. It would weld off, you couldn   t  burn it. You had to do something, so just burn a hole in front and run a  path on the inside, sewed it up. That horizontal is easy to sew up.  Did it pay pretty good?  I don   t remember what it paid an hour, do you?  I don   t remember, but no, I don   t think a whole lot.  Would it be an eight-hour a day job?  Yes.  Yes, eight-hour day. Mine was seven. I had the graveyard shift. I had to  work seven hours.  I worked graveyard until I got pregnant. I was still working, but they  asked me to quit because they were afraid I   d get hurt.  I worked graveyard four years and missed one shift, Saturday, Sunday,  and all.     and so I quit.  There   s a picture hanging on the wall of the ships we built.  Yes, and I showed you that picture last time, didn   t I?  Yes.  I showed it to them when they were here before.  Were there other married couples that did this?  Well, I   m sure there was. I really didn   t know. I mean, you know, you  just knew who was on your crew. You had certain people on your crew.  There were welding crews. When I went back to work after she was  born   she was six weeks old, but there was someone with her all the  time, the way it worked out. My sister was out there. She was working  days, he was working graveyard, and I went back to swing shift. When I  went back, I wanted something easier because she wasn   t very old, so I  decided I   d be a weld checker.  When I went up to the hiring hall, I asked for that, and she said,    The  18  Bishop  B. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  Finchum  B. Hudson  only thing that   s open is welding.    I said,    Well, I   m a journeyman  welder.    She said,    If you   re a journeyman welder, you   d better go back  to welding.    So I went back as a welder, and the first place they started  to send me was on 1-B, and it was terrible to get around on. I said to the  leader man,    I have a baby just six weeks old, and I would rather go to  an easier place right now.    He said to those other guys,    Send her to   .     I forgot where they sent me now, but anyway, I didn   t go to 1-B. There  was a man right behind me, and he looked at him, and he said,    Don   t  you try that.    (Laughter)  What was bad in the double bottoms, you were down in there with  double bottoms, and your welding lead was no telling how long or how  far your machine was. Some smart aleck would go down through there,  either reverse the polarity on your machine or turn it off. You   d have to  come out of there and go up and see what was wrong. Pretty soon after  you work there long enough, you get to where you do the same thing.  (Laughter) If you were feeling real ornery some nights, you just go down  there doing the same thing.  Turnabout is fair play.  They had a blackout one night, and they had told us if we ever had a  blackout where to go. He was over on the outfitting dock, and he was  supposed to go to a certain place over there. Well, I was on the  assemblies, and I went to a different place. It was just real, real  moonlight. The lights all went off. If you could imagine all these  machines going and all these lights on, and suddenly everything goes  silent (Claps). It was so much moonlight you could tell where to go. You  didn   t have any trouble. I went where I was supposed to go. I hadn   t  been there very long, look up, and here he (Fay) was. He   d come over  there instead of going where he was supposed to. It wasn   t too long until  they let us go back to work. They said they sighted a plane, but they  couldn   t tell what it was. That   s what they told us, but it was an  experience.  I remember that blackout.  Yes, and we lived up on the hill in Richmond, California. It was some  Heights, Eastern Heights. I can   t remember now. We   d have to drive  down off there with no lights on. We were living with his mother and  stepdad. His stepdad welded, too, and he would drive down.  Is that how you found out about the work, the job?  Well, how did we find that work?  19  Bishop  Finchum  Gray  F. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  Gray  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Gray  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  Yes, I was kind of curious. Why did you go? That   s kind of     Yes, I mean, why did you go?  Why did you go to California and work out there?  Why did we?  Yes.  Stay out of the draft. I don   t know.  Well, it was defense. Teaching wasn   t a defensive job.  If you were in defense, they wouldn   t come as near drafting you.  I got Blanche   s sister to take my school, and I went to California to   .  Because they were at war?  Yes.  Did you have a job before you got there?  No, I got a job when I got there. They were looking for everybody then.  Yes, you just knew you could go to work because they needed people.  Just showed up, huh? Drive out or take the train?  It was a cost-plus job. Guys there was making ten cents on every dollar  that they   d spend, and they even brought the Indians off of the  reservations out there that couldn   t do nothing to get the money. The  yard we worked in worked 39,000. That was Yard  3 .  She asked how you got to California.  On the train.  We worked at Yard 3, Fay.  Didn   t have nothing when we left, so didn   t have to store much.  Well, you had me.  Yes, but you went with us.  20  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  Bishop  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  Gray  Bishop  F. Hudson  Bishop  F. Hudson  Bishop  Gray  F. Hudson  Gray  Took you with us.  He meant furniture.  Did you run into other Oklahomans out there, because a lot left during  the Dust Bowl?  Lots of us out there, lots of us.  You were going to school when I was teaching in this one-room school  by Asher. How old were you, three?  I think so.  Yes.  She wanted to go, and Blanche didn   t want her to. Stayed down by the  schoolhouse and cried to go to school. I told her,    She   s going to go,    so  I got her a desk and put her in it, and she sat there. I tried to teach the  third grade a poem, and finally she said,    Daddy, can I say it?    So she  came up and said the poem. The third graders couldn   t say it. (Laughter)  I guess I   d listened to them practice so much, I knew it.  You taught the third graders that they needed to learn it.  Then I talked her into going to college and hired her as a teacher at  Wanette, and she taught for twenty-seven years. I taught forty.  I have a question. There   s a little WPA sign on the outside of your  house. What is the story behind that sign?  A schoolhouse a mile north of here where I was teaching burned, Adell,  and we got it built with WPA, and they put this WPA sign on it. Well,  Wanette school took it over, and they moved the building to Wanette,  and I went down there as superintendent. I put metal on it to preserve it,  and that sign was on it, and I brought the sign out here.  I was curious because you see a lot of them on sidewalks.  Yes.  That   s my souvenir.  So they built Adell School. The WPA built Adell School.  21  F. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  Finchum  B. Hudson  Finchum  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  Yes.  Okay, I didn   t realize that.  Yes.  Out of stone or brick?  Wood.  It was wood? That   s why it burned, I guess.  And when the schoolhouse burned     They furnished money for a lot of things. The WPA would keep the  economy going.  Adell School had a teacherage. They didn   t all have a teacherage just for  the teacher, but Adell did. When the school burned, they had school in  our house. There was a side room to it, and they fixed the lunches out  there.  Until they got the school built again?  Yes, lots of experiences.  Well, what brought you back to Oklahoma after being in the shipyard?  To raise our kids.  That   s what he said. See, when the war was over, the women were out of  the shipyard immediately. I knew they would be, and I always said if I  find out ahead of time, I won   t do a lick of work that night. We saw so  many of them. There were some women from Texas, two of them, and  they would come to work and get the time card and clock in, and the  leader man would not see them, and they   d get to come get their time  card and clock out.  Where were they?  I don   t know where they were. (Laughs) That leader man said he would  rather have someone from Oklahoma on his crew than anybody. He said  people from Oklahoma will work. That   s why I said that, because I said  I won   t do anything. Well, it was over, and I knew that was my last  night. He (Fay) got to work in the shipyard quite a while after that. I  22  Gray  B. Hudson  Finchum  B. Hudson  Finchum  B. Hudson  Bishop  B. Hudson  Gray  Bishop  F. Hudson  Gray  can   t remember how long. In fact, she (Martha) started school in  California. As soon as he quit working there, he said,    We   re going  home. I   m not raising my kids out here.    We got back to Oklahoma. We  were pulling a trailer, and it was pouring down rain. My mother had  been out there with us, and we went to her house. The electricity wasn   t  on. I said,    Let   s just turn around and go back.    (Laughter)  She had a two-story house, and it was so scary. I never will forget that.  (Laughs)  Then when she started school out there they had the high and low. Well,  see, that was part of my problem. They pushed me through school. I  grew up too fast. They put me through the third and fourth the same  year. Then whenever I got in the seventh grade, they said,    If you take  the eighth grade test and pass it, you can go on to high school.    Well, I  took it and passed it and went on to high school. When I got to high  school, I was lost. When we got back here, I think she was in the high  second. I put her in the second grade, and one of the teachers said,    She  ought to be in the third grade. She can do third grade work.    I said,    If  she can do it this year, she can do it better next year.    I didn   t let them  push her through.  Well, did you finish high school?  I married my junior year, but I did go back.  Get a GED?  In 1953 he was superintendent in Wanette. The lady that lived next door  was a teacher, and they both started in on me.    Go back and finish. Go  back and finish.    Finally I told him, I said,    See how many credits I  lack.    He checked, and he said,    You lack three credits.    I said,    I   ll go  back, but I won   t take a class under you.    (Laughter)  Why not?  I wasn   t about to go to school to him. (Laughter) They (our daughters)  had to.  Yes, we did.  What was it like teaching your daughters in school?  It didn   t make any difference to me.  He was harder on his daughters than he was the rest of them.  23  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  Finchum  B. Hudson  Finchum  B. Hudson  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Yes, and everybody thinks they   re easier.  Just another student.  I never played hooky or anything because I knew he would know I was  not there. But our senior year, we went out on the bus, some of us girls  in the senior class, and boys. We were sitting out on the bus, and he got  to looking for all of us. I couldn   t get away with anything.  Nope. When our youngest daughter was in high school, she was a queen  candidate, and they were going out that day to get people to help. They  came to me and wanted me to let her go. I said,    I can   t let her go. If  she   s not at school, he knows what   s going on.    I said,    She cannot go.     Our kids had to go to school. They couldn   t play hooky, but I played  hooky.  We still operate a thirteen hundred-acre ranch. The guy out here now is  mowing cedar trees.  He fights them cedar trees, but I told him it   s a losing battle.  I noticed the sign said Hulin Creek.  Hulin.  Hulin, Hulin Creek. Whose name is that?  Oh, that   s the creek over here.  It   s the creek.  It   s the creek, okay. It   s not the name of the family that owned it  initially?  Right.  Hulin. So how long have you had that? How long have you had thirteen  acres?  Thirteen hundred.  Thirteen hundred acres.  Oh, twenty years.  24  Gray  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  Gray  Finchum  B. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  Gray  F. Hudson  Gray  Finchum  F. Hudson  Gray  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  Gray  You started buying them when I was in high school, so it   s probably,  well     I   ve probably got it all wrote down in there.  The last eighty we bought was Indian land, and I said,    If he died or if  his wife wanted to get rid of it, let me have it.    So I bought the eighty  acres. It   s a mile over here, just like the Indians found it. It   s never had  nothing done to it since Columbus discovered America. She (Martha)  said it had grapevine down there as big around as her waist.  (Looking in book) This is the years that he bought the places and what  he paid for them     All connected.  Our grandson   s an architect, and he   s pretty good with all of this.     and who had them before he bought them. He started buying them in,  probably     Well, they were in the land        the 1950s, I guess.     close by. He bought it.  You started buying land in the 1950s?  Oh, I started    46.  And then that eighty we just bought, probably, five years ago.  And what did you raise? Raising cattle or     What   d I raise?  On this farm, yes.  I raised maize, and had for a while wheat and fancy rye and vetch, and  had some peanuts, went to cotton, washed some land away     Combined some vetch one time.  Well, on this place here, you raised cattle, and there   s a lot of pecan  trees.  25  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  Gray  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  Finchum  Bishop  B. Hudson  Bishop  Finchum  Gray  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  Pecans.  Cows, that   s what we got now.  You did that while you were teaching, too?  Yes.  So then what were your chores?  Picking up brush.  Taught school all day and plow half of the night and go to college the  next morning, and then go back to school.  One night when he was  driving the  tractor, I went to bed and went to  sleep. I woke up about eleven thirty, and he wasn   t in. I thought,    Well, I  better go see about him.    He had a seven thirty class, I think it was, at  Ada the next morning. I drove over there, and he was still going around.  I come home, and thought,    Well   .     If you don   t tell a lie, you don   t ever have to remember what you said.  That   s a good philosophy.  This picture   s pretty neat because it has State Highway 39, but then  there   s a road to California.  Yes, that   s showing when we went to California.  Is that the road you took?    1849, Road to California.     So you got married in what year?  (Referring to photo) That sounds like the   49ers, when they went out  there for gold.  When we got married     It was lucky the way it turned out.  The year you got married?  Yes.  26  Gray  B. Hudson  Finchum  Bishop  B. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  Finchum  B. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  Gray  Finchum  Gray  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  Bishop  Gray  Nineteen thirty-eight.  Thank you. (Laughs)  We didn   t have that on there, and I was thinking,    Okay, what year   .     Right in the Dust Bowl days.  Yes.  Yes.  When I was in high school, when you   d come home in the morning, you  couldn   t see any dust. Of course, you know, here, this area was not hit  that bad because when we would get out of school in the afternoon,  you   d get on the bus and start home, you couldn   t see the sun. I mean,  you could see it, but you couldn   t. You could look at it. It was so much  dust in the air, but it wasn   t bad here like it was in western Oklahoma. It  was terrible out there.  I can   t imagine supper time with that much dust around.  Well, lots of them died from dust pneumonia. They would take wet rags  and put it across their mouth and nose. Yes, that Dust Bowl was terrible,  and that was all because they hadn   t plowed the ground right. You  know, that   s all they had to make a living was     Plowing, right?  We had a lot of pecan trees, too.  Yes, we picked up a lot of them, too.  Yes, that   s what I used to do when I was kid: pick up pecans.  And then sell them?  Yes.  One year we, we picked up     Seven years ago we got eighty thousand pounds.  Oh my gosh.  But we don   t pick them up now. They do it mechanically.  27  B. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  Finchum  Bishop  B. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  Bishop  One year we were picking up pecans every Sunday, every Saturday.  Every Sunday when we should have been going to church, we were  picking up pecans.  Every holiday.  Every holiday, every evening after school. I kept telling him,    Fay, we  can   t get them all. I don   t think we can get them all.    So a guy came by  one evening and told Fay, he said,    I   d like to pick them up.    See, he  (Fay) couldn   t thrash them. He wouldn   t get up in the tree and thrash  them. He (the guy) said he would thrash them and have his own pickers  and give you more than half. Fay said,    I   ll let you come out tomorrow,  and if I   m satisfied with you tomorrow evening, you can have the job.     How much did they have that day?  First day, they got twelve hundred pounds.  Mercy, that   s a lot of nuts.  Yes, it is.  I knew we couldn   t get them all.  And I sure was glad.  (Gray) was working  at the caf    over at Asher, and whenever you   d  have grass burrs, (you   ve got gloves on) I   d take my teeth, pull the grass  burr out, and spit it out. Well, she did that, and she accidentally  swallowed one.  Yes, I sucked it down my throat.  She had to go to work. We got through picking up pecans and cleaned  up. We went over with Fay to eat, and I said,    Where   s Martha?    He  said,    She   s in the restroom, sick.    I don   t really think it was a grass  burr. I don   t know what it was.  I didn   t want to pick up pecans anymore. (Laughter) No, I think it was a  virus or something that I had.  So we   ve all worked.  You talked about working during   having to go to church. How  important was religion in your life and family life?  28  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Gray  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  Pretty well, we attended church pretty regular.  In later years. For a few years we didn   t   but we finally     We started out whenever I was left  to take care of  family. To give you  an example, I planted twenty acres of cotton, and the guy across the road  from me said,    You planted too thick.    He planted his with  a planter   that controlled the plants coming up. That way he didn   t have to hoe it.  Came one of them floods, and I had enough seeded to raise the ground. I  had a good stand of cotton, and he didn   t put a sack in the field. The next  year, I got it on a ridge, and he was laughing at me when I was thrashing  the grain. I had my cotton laid back because I had it on a ridge. I picked  five bales of cotton. They didn   t put a sack in the field because they put  theirs in the furrow. Turned off dry. I was just lucky. The good Lord just  looked after me.  For a few years we did not attend church regular, but we got started  doing that and have for several years.  You had a tractor by that time?  No.  No?  Horses.  Horses?  Mules. I   ve been in the field at four o   clock in the morning when I  couldn   t even see, but the horses could, and plowed, because I had to go  to school. Had to get stuff done. Had to do it after dark.  Well, do you remember your first tractor?  Yes, Poppin    Johnny.  He   s still got it.  Two-cylinder John Deere.  Poppin    Johnny?  I guess it   s about fifty. I   ve still got it out here. It   s a    58 model.  Does it run?  29  F. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  Bishop  Gray  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  Bishop  B. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  Bishop  F. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  Yes.  It needs some work done on it.  He had to pull it all the time to start it. For years, had to pull that tractor  to start it, and  our grand son had to pull it some.  Did you buy it used or new?  You bought it used, didn   t you? Was it a used tractor when you bought  it?  Oh, yes.  He said to Fay one time, I think he was about eighth grade     He was tired of pulling it, right?     he said,    If I was you, I   d run that SOB off in the deepest creek I had,  deepest pond I had.    (Laughter)  Well, it   s still here, it sounds like. (Laughs)  I went to a funeral one time, and he wanted me to be back by a certain  time to pull that tractor. (Laughter)  Well, all of this work, what did you do for fun?  Oh, I took enough time to do a little catting around.  He went with all the girls in the country. (Laughter)  Ever go dancing?  Oh, yes, we had dances around the houses at night.  And they used to have pie suppers. You   ve heard of those haven   t you?  Yes.  We had a band. Bob Wills    band played, Bob Wills and his sons.  Back in California.  Mansel Tirney and them made music for us around here in the  30  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  Gray  F. Hudson  Bishop  F. Hudson  Bishop  F. Hudson  Gray  F. Hudson  Bishop  F. Hudson  Bishop  community to dance. They went to school up here at Adell.  Whenever we lived in California, we went to Bob Wills    dance. There  was a serviceman there. I   ll never forget that. You know, during World  War II they wore those heavy  uniforms , and jitterbugging was popular.  He was jitterbugging. He couldn   t keep a partner, but he   d find  somebody else to dance with him, and he had sweated clear through  those clothes. I mean he could jitterbug. It was kind of a show just to go  and watch him. One night, he (Fay) was always teasing me and popping  off, and they was singing    Take Me Back to Tulsa,    so I said     My first adventure was with my brother and my neighbor boy, going  into the fur business. That   s when you get a catalog, and you go around  and skin possums and skunks and stuff like that, send it to the Kansas  City fur market, and you get a quarter or fifty cents, something for it.  Anyway, they got this book that said    cat hides,    so they had some cats  in a sack. They believed that   s seven years of bad luck, and they wanted  to know if they gave me a third of the money if I   d kill the cats. I killed  seven cats. They sent the hides in, and it brought eleven cents. They  were talking about Angora cats. They wasn   t talking about them alley  cats. (Laughter)  So you got three cents?  Yes.  What do you think about all of the changes in education?  I think it stinks. (Laughter)  And what about all the technology that we have and use? What do you  think about that in schools?  They can   t even add and subtract. They can   t even give you change at  the store.  That   s right.  What they call education, I don   t know. Some of it   s good, I guess, and  some of it   s not so good. Blow us up one of these days.  Well, did you ever think you   d make it to a hundred?  Never thought about it.  What   s your secret?  31  F. Hudson  Bishop  F. Hudson  Bishop  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  Gray  F. Hudson  Gray  Bishop  Gray  B. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  Bishop  B. Hudson  Got there, and my kids give me a party. I didn   t really think nothing  about it. Still don   t. I feel better now than I did ten years ago.  And do you have a secret to living long?  Good cook, good nurse. I can   t go to the bathroom now without her  asking me. (Laughter)  Now, you   ve lived a hundred years. I just asked you about your secret,  but what   s your secret to a long, happy marriage?  I told her I was going, she told me where to go. (Laughter)  That   s not true.  She   s real laid back and     We never did get in each other   s way.     goes along with the show. That   s not what she told the guys from  Channel 9. They came down here and interviewed them. Did I tell you  what she told them?  No.  You can tell them what she told Channel 9, about being married for  seventy-six years.     The grass is greener   ?  Yes.  I said people now, when they get married, they don   t like things. They  think the grass is greener on the other side of the fence, but it has to be  mowed, too. (Laughter) I truly believe it now. Whenever I got married     She knew a good thing when she had it. (Laughter)  What   d you say? I missed that.  He said you knew a good thing when you had it. (Laughs)  You did, too  Anyway   now I don   t know what I started to tell.  (Laughter)  32  Finchum  B. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  Gray  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Finchum  F. Hudson  Bishop  F. Hudson  B. Hudson  Gray  What do you think is the secret to a long marriage? You were starting to  say what you really think.  Oh, well, when I got married, they   d just say,    You   ve made your bed.  Lay in it.    You got married and you stayed married. Divorce was not   .  An option.  Well, when his mother got a divorce, people in the community  thought   I don   t know what they thought, but she was one of the first  women I know of that ever got divorced. You just didn   t divorce then,  but now they just go into it,    If I don   t like it, I can get out. I don   t have  to stay, and you don   t have to stay.     We traveled a lot every summer, and we made thirty-six trips to  California by automobile and several by airplane     That   s where his mother lived.     when my mother lived out there. We made it, took the kids, drove the  ALCAN  Alaska-Canadian  Highway all the way to Alaska. We was  there at Valdez when  oil  first came into the  pipeline , Japanese got the  big oil out of the pipeline.  Is there anything left on your bucket list you want to do?  Well, just clean up my land. I   m still working on cleaning up the land.  And go to Cattlemen   s  Steakhouse  for your anniversary.  Got a guy coming from soil conservation on a program they got for the  farm. Teaching the daughters. They   re doing it now because I deeded it  to them over forty years ago, and they own the land. I pay taxes on   I  mean I don   t even have home exemption because they own the place.  You can   t take it with you, so I deeded it to them.  It sounds like you   re still learning today. Do you go to a lot of meetings  and Oklahoma  Teachers Retirement  meetings?  Yes, I go to Cattlemen   s and Teacher Retirement and whatever. I learn a  little bit.  He belongs to Diamond K Kiwanis.

Then she  (Gray) started going, and they kept on until she joined.  One year we got fifty-seven new members to the Cattlemen   s  Association, more than anybody in the state of Oklahoma. They gave a  rifle for twenty-five, and I got a rifle for each one of my grandkids,  grandsons. Got the brand engraved on the rifle.  Are you still an active member?  Yes. I   m not quitting until the time comes to go. (Laughter) When the  good Lord calls, that   ll be it.  What   s a typical day for you?  Tell him what you did yesterday. He said,    What   s a typical day for you  now?    What   d you do yesterday?  I went to Shawnee and got some tomato plants to put out in the garden  when the weather gets right. I got the tomato plants out in the  greenhouse, and I   ll water them until after the first of May, and then I   ll  put them out. I   ll have some early tomatoes.  Didn   t you go get feed? Didn   t you all get feed, too, for the cattle?  Yes. Got Anaplaz, we have to give them Anaplaz. Horseflies get them,  bites them. Give them Anaplaz and kills them, so you have to keep  Anaplaz out.  But what is a typical day? I mean, what do you do on a typical day?  What time do you get up and what do you do, and what time do you go  to bed?  I get up and check with my employees, what we   re going to get done.  What time do you usually get up?  About seven. That   s when they come to work.  And then when do you go to bed?  Oh, anywhere from six o   clock to ten.  Depends whether he   s got somebody to play Moon with.  34  Finchum  B. Hudson  Finchum  Bishop  B. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  Gray  Finchum  Bishop  Gray  B.

Her son got him some dominoes a few years ago that   s real easy to read.  I can   t hear nor see TV.  They get this light over here and put it over there for him.  Dominoes is something they played back in the older days.  I don   t know if he played dominoes. Did you play dominoes when you  were growing up?  Yes.  We never did. We played cards at my house.  A little bit. Played Pitch most of the time.  Pitch, I   ve heard of that.  We didn   t have dominoes, but I played lots of cards, Pinochle. Did you  ever play Pinochle?

If you don   t do it when you get to it, you  may   never get at it again.    (Laughter)  You ought to teach that one to that lady that drinks that wine every  morning.

That   s what I like to do.  You like to teach, too. He enjoyed teaching.  Built twenty-three ponds.  Twenty-three?  Wow, that   s a lot.  Well, remember, there   s 1,360 acres.  Yes.  It takes a lot.  How many ponds you say?  He said twenty-three.  Oh. I thought he said,    two or three.    (Laughter) I told him one time he  was pond-poor.  Did he build them himself or have someone come in and do it?  Had them built.  Well, he used to have a bulldozer, and when he did have a bulldozer, he  would build some of them.  Yes, he did. He had a bulldozer. He almost run it off a cliff one evening.  What was he? Ninety or ninety-five.  No, he wasn   t that old, I don   t think.  He was ninety, I think.  39  Gray  B.

He said he guessed it was time he better quit running them. He couldn   t  see as good.  He   s creative. He built this  carport into a  caterpillar?  Yes.  Yes, and then he   s got a deal in here that he built, too. You guys might  want to look at that, or did you see it when you were here the other day?  No. We can look in a minute. Just creative.  Yes.  Yes, he   s very creative.  Like I said, he   s a jack-of-all-trades. (Laughs)  Anything else you want to add before we close off?  I helped Mrs.  Lady Bird  Johnson with Beautify America when she  came out with that program, Beautify America. I had a bunch of scrub  timber over here, and I dozed off ten acres of it and planted pine trees to  help her make the country look better. She   s (Martha) got her house in  the pine grove now, and I   ve got a four-acre pond in front of the house.  You ought to go over there and see it.  Yes, it   s a spring-fed pond, so the water is     Beautify America        relatively clear. It   s a beautiful place.     and I helped do it.  The sun sets there just perfect, and you can see some beautiful sunsets.  I think we   ll close out and say thank you very much for sharing your  story with us today. It   s been a pleasure.  If there   s anything we can help, well, let us know.  I was going to tell you, too, there   s a swing out here on the front porch  40  Finchum  Gray  Bishop  Gray  Bishop  Finchum  Bishop  B. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  F. Hudson  Finchum  Bishop  F. Hudson  Gray  that   s about a hundred years old that we used to go sit and court in.  That   s impressive, too. It   s still safe to sit in now?  Yes, he goes out there and sits in it now.  She said they courted in it?  Yes.  Oh my gosh, we got to get a picture of that one. (Laughter)  That   s the secret: you   re still sitting on the front porch.  If you can still both sit on it, that   s the secret to a long marriage.  I know in my mind that my dad had it built because years ago people  built everything. He had an ice box built. He had it built in the cellar,  and they delivered three hundred pounds of ice out there at a time. We  lived in a community with a lot of people, and they were   all  carpenters, so I   m sure he had them build that swing.  And you think it was built when? When was it built? What year?  Well, I don   t know for sure, but they married in 1900. I   m sure he had it  built before too long. I can   t tell you for sure, but I sat in it when I was  growing up.  But you don   t remember how old you were when you first started     It was there when I got     I took biology, and I learned all the snakes of Oklahoma, scientific name  and common name. Knew them all. I started collecting them at school  and didn   t put enough formaldehyde on them. When I got to school one  morning, they   d blown up. (Laughter) I had   snakes around, all over the  floor. (Laughter)  From beans to snakes.  Did you ever try to catch rattlesnakes?  I went to the rattlesnake hunt. She (Martha) caught a forty-six-inch,  wasn   t it?  It was over six feet long. We butchered it, and I took it to school     41  F. Hudson  Gray  B. Hudson  Bishop  Gray  F. Hudson  Gray  Bishop  Gray  B. Hudson  Bishop  B. Hudson  Gray  Finchum  Gray  B. Hudson  Brought it home and had a snake fry.     and we cooked it in a crock pot. The kids just thought that was so  exciting. Even the superintendent came over.  For a few years, he hunted rattlesnakes every year. Took the high school  kids with him.  Where was the hunt?  At Okeene.  Took my class out there, the biology students.  Did I give you one of those bookmarks? That picture where he   s young,  he was at the Okeene rattlesnake hunt.  There   s a couple of hunts, but that   s the main one here in Oklahoma.  Yes. We went rattlesnake hunting   he had a student that lived up by  Woodward, and his brother lives out here. One time his brothers asked  my dad if he wanted to go rattlesnake hunting. The way they do it, they  cheat because they wait until the snakes are coming out of hibernation  and they   re real sluggish. Then you go rattlesnake hunting. We caught  quite a few that day.  I let them do that. I don   t care for that.  I   d be with you. (Laughter) That   s something he can do on his own.  I was with him one time on a rattlesnake hunt, but I didn   t get out there.  I guess he didn   t want me to be afraid of snakes, so when I was probably  in the third grade, he paid me three dollars to carry a snake from the  schoolhouse to our house. It was probably, what, two blocks, so I did. I  guess it worked.  A live one?  Yes, it was a live one, yes.  One time, he had some geese here that he wanted to take over to her  pond. Our great-granddaughter was in here. She had a girlfriend with  her, and our  great- granddaughter wouldn   t pick the goose up, but the  other girl would. Of course, he (Fay) nicknamed her Goose. Our  42  Gray  B. Hudson  Finchum  grandson had a ball team, softball. He would go to ballgames, and he   d  holler at her,    Goose  Goose     Then when our great-granddaughter got  married, we went to the wedding, and the girl came over to us and said,     Don   t you know me? I   m Goose.    (Laughter) She wasn   t a bit afraid of  them.  I didn   t know his story about the formaldehyde and the snakes, but I  had   I   ve always liked science. I   m not really a science teacher, but I  had science stuff in my classroom all the time. I had an octopus that  we   d had in our aquarium, and it died, and I put it in formaldehyde. I  had some other things in formaldehyde on my shelf, on the science shelf.  One day we had to stay in at recess because it was bad outside. This one  little girl, she was a little bit retarded   somebody knocked one of those  off and spilled. It was the octopus. You know that formaldehyde, how  horrible it is and everything. It was going all over the floor, and there  was the dead octopus laying there. I rushed the kids out of the  classroom, raised the window, and told them to go down to the first  grade because the teacher down there said she   d watch them. She went  down there and told that teacher,    Miss Gray had a dead octopus laying  in her floor.    (Laughs) That teacher said,    Yeah, right.    That   s the  beauty about teaching school.   Our other daughter  didn   t go on to school. She  became  a school  secretary.  Still in the education business, though.  ------- End of Interview -------
