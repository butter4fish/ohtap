 Gill. Today is December 3, 2009 and I   m visiting with  Chris Stephens in Oklahoma City at his office. This interview is for the  O-STATE Stories Project of the Oklahoma Oral History Research  Program. Chris, I know you   re busy today and I appreciate you taking  the time to visit. It   s good to see you again.  Happy to be a part. Good to see you, Jerry.  First of all, Chris, could we start with your early life? Tell us where you  grew up and a little about your family and some of the things earlier in  your life.  Sure. I was born in Edmond but my parents, who were OSU graduates,  were living in Guthrie at the time. I was born in 1975. My parents were  agricultural education teachers and FFA  Future Farmers of America   advisors at Guthrie High School at the time. From    75 through the mid-eighties,  I lived in Guthrie. Then my parents moved to take a similar job  in Chickasha so we moved to Chickasha in the mid-eighties and I  finished high school there in 1994. I grew up in kind of a farming and  ranching background. We had some cattle. I showed cattle growing up  and spent a lot of time out on the farm with that as a child. Then,  through high school, I tried to get a little more involved with Student  Council and some of the National Honor Society activities and also  spent a lot of time with FFA. One of the things I did when I got to  Stillwater was, my first year there, I served as a state FFA officer which  continued a lot of the things I tried to do in FFA in high school.  From the FFA experiences working the farm, were there some life  lessons that you learned there? Were there some things that influenced  you?  Sure, I think so. I think at least some of them were positive. My parents  5  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  were big believers in hard work. We always had a lot to do around the  house and we had a lot of chores. I think those are good things, looking  back. So we had a lot of early mornings and daily responsibilities taking  care of the cattle. We spent a lot of weekends and holidays out, whether  it was feeding hay or taking care of the cattle to make sure that the job  got done. I certainly appreciate the work ethic those types of activities  taught and think that   s a great transferrable skill no matter what you do.  You   d haul some hay there and hay bale?  On occasion. We did more large bales. When it would come to the small  bales of hay, we did have to do a little bit of that during the summertime.  I always thought of that as some of the best motivational work possible.  (Laughter) After trying to load those hundred pound bales of alfalfa, it  makes going back to school pretty exciting.  It   s a great incentive. (Laughs)  That   s right. It   s a good incentive to finish the degree and maybe get an  office job.  Were you involved in any sports in high school or other things? You  mentioned FFA and some student leadership positions. Are there other  things you were engaged with?  Yes, I played baseball a little bit in junior high and high school, in my  freshman year. Then, in part because I wasn   t very good and because I  thought I could maybe do a little better with FFA and some of the  scholastic activities, I didn   t play sports any more than that. I did play a  little bit of that   some of the intramurals at Oklahoma State, primarily  limited to ping pong. (Laughter)  Do you have a good story there?  I was the B-league ping pong champion one year at Oklahoma State and  then the next year, I bumped up to the A-league and I made it to the  quarter finals. There were four of us left. I think I was the only  Oklahoman left.  That   s great. Speaking of Oklahoma State University, did other things  influence you to enroll in Oklahoma State University?  There were. It was a combination of my parents and my grandpa had  gone to school there and I had grown up and as I   ve described, was  pretty involved with ag activities and FFA. A lot of the students coming  up from the small towns in Oklahoma, as you know, end up at  6  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  Oklahoma State in the College of Ag, so that part was appealing to me.  Then, my freshman year, as part of service as an FFA officer, we did a  lot of activities through the FFA through the Career Tech center which  was there in Stillwater. Several of those factors went together to seem  like Stillwater was the right place. I didn   t apply to any other schools.  The thought kind of crossed my mind, but I don   t have any regrets and  was happy to get to Stillwater in the fall of    94.  Now, your major was ag econ, is that right?  That   s right.  How did you decide on ag econ?  Again, it was I think kind of the natural choice for those of us growing  up in some of the rural areas. A lot of the folks I had known through  FFA or through my community had studied in the College of Ag. It  didn   t necessarily mean they were returning necessarily to full-time ag  careers, but I   d heard that program was a great training ground for  business or for law. For people who wanted to remain involved with  agriculture, maybe not full time.  I may be jumping head of the story a little bit Chris, but I know you later  went to law school. As an undergraduate, did you intend to go to law  school? Was that a goal?  It was a thought. I   m not sure it was what I had in mind necessarily.  Early on I knew I wanted to do some type of government work and I  thought maybe some type of a public administration degree or Master   s  degree more related to ag or some type of ag science might be the right  thing. I had thought about law school, but frankly I didn   t have any  lawyers in the family and didn   t have a lot context for what law school  would be or the practice of law would be. But, decided really at the end  of my time at Oklahoma State and then when I was over in graduate  school, that law school would be a nice next step.  Going back to OSU, I assume you   d been there probably several times  with FFA activities, sports activities, different things with your family,  probably sporting events. But as a student when you first came on  campus, what were some of your first impressions of OSU?  Well, the first impressions were very favorable to me. I had been there  dozens of times growing up and we had spent a lot of nights there in  Stillwater with FFA activities or different conventions or meetings in  Stillwater, or livestock shows. I was certainly familiar with the  community, not necessarily with the campus. Coming from Chickasha,  7  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  where we had more than a hundred students in my class, but certainly  not like the campus of Oklahoma State, I was, like it was for a lot of  students, a little bit intimidating at the time just given the size. I did join  a fraternity and had the benefit of several guys in the house who were  very active on campus who helped ease that transition for me, so it was  certainly a transition, but I felt fortunate to have known several dozen  students who were there already. Things went pretty well to get started.  Well, you were a very focused student and always have been. Did you  have a plan when you came to Oklahoma State, specific expectations for  your undergraduate experience?  I   m not sure I had specific expectations. I   d come to Oklahoma State  wanting to challenge myself and I had read, right around the time I got  to Oklahoma State, about guys who had gone on to some of these  scholarships that I later applied for like Bryan Begley, who had just won  a Truman Scholarship and been a finalist for a Rhodes. I also had the  benefit of getting acquainted with Wes Holley in the College of Ag.  He   had known my parents when they were in school together with Wes  back  at  Oklahoma State several years ago. Dr. Holley really challenged  me early on that if you want to do some really neat things on campus,  there are lots of people who are here to help you. If you   re thinking  about some of these scholarships maybe to apply for well-known  graduate schools or study overseas, you can do that. So at least I had that  seed in the back of my mind. I   m not sure I had everything scripted out.  I certainly can   t say that. But, I had an idea that I wanted to take  advantage of everything I could there.  Well, to sort of break that into two parts, first of all, the social activities,  student organizations   aside from your scholar development programs  what things were you engaged in? The fraternity you were in was     Yes, Alpha Gamma Rho. I was in the AGR house and boy, try to take a  trip down memory lane. I remember, for example, as a freshman, getting  involved with the Agricultural Student Council as a freshman  representative. I was on the   gosh, I   m forgetting the names   I think it  was called FRC, Freshman Representative Council within student  government. I was also on the President   s Leadership Council and then  tried to join a couple of other activities or groups. I was a committee  member with Homecoming my freshman year and a couple of other  things. And then the neat part of a place like Stillwater, or I think most  colleges, is in some ways there are natural progressions. Once you do  certain things your freshman year then there were different activities  where you kind of needed to have some things under your belt for your  freshman year, so I tried to get a little more involved with the Alpha  Gamma Rho fraternity and a little bit more involved in the College of  8  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Ag and then got more involved in the Alumni Association with some of  the Homecoming activities.  How did you first learn about the Scholar Development Program? Were  you in the Freshman Scholar Program?  No, I wasn   t and I don   t remember at the time back in    94 which  programs were available. I was familiar enough with the program as it  existed in the mid    90s to take Dr. Graalman   s Windows to the World  class as a freshman. That was a small one or two hour elective course  where we talked about current events, but it really was a segue into  getting to know Bob Graalman better and trying to better understand  what types of scholarships were out there. I think that was probably the  first step I took to learn more about the scholarships and I don   t recall  whether it was through Wes Holley or upperclassmen on campus how I  learned about that program, but I became involved and started to  develop a relationship with Dr. Graalman and some of the opportunities  through the program. And from there I just tried to keep in touch with  him my freshman, sophomore year and then later on as a junior and  senior, certainly spend more time with the program when I was applying  for the Truman and the Marshall and some of those programs.  Did you have a Wentz research project?  I did not.  That   s interesting.  I did not and I was involved with the Honors College but I, either     frankly I don   t remember even considering applying for it and it   s  something looking back I probably wish I would have had to develop  more of a research study with a professor on campus, but I didn   t do a  Wentz. I tried to pick up a couple of minors and do the Honors College  but that is one of the things I missed out on.  The reason I ask that is because a lot of the awardees that won  prestigious scholarships that I talk to either started with a freshman  scholarship or had a Wentz research project.  That   s right, yes. No, I guess I was an exception to that rule.  Could you explain what different components you were engaged in  within the Scholar Development Program? Like you mentioned Bob  Graalman, who was director of the program, his Windows to the World  program, and then there   s the Wentz program, there   s the Honors  College program that you were talking about. Then there   s preparing  9  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  for the scholarships. But, could you explain your evolution, how you  were engaged?  Again, I   m testing my memory here from   incredibly it   s fifteen years  now, but I got involved with Dr. Graalman   s class in my freshman year,  which would have been    94-   95. Then, I took some honors classes and  kept in touch with him because by that time I became familiar with some  of the students who   d been applying for the Truman, the Marshall and  the Rhodes and didn   t want to necessarily mimic what those folks had  done but wanted to be able to put myself in the best position possible. I  remember going in there on occasion to talk to him about some of those  scholarships, but really it wasn   t until the time I applied for the Truman  Scholarship back in the spring of    98 but I would have started applying  the fall of    97, when I kind of reengaged with that program and spent a  lot of time with Dr. Graalman and the program and kind of  understanding and preparing the application materials for the Truman.  That carried on into the next year, into    98 and    99 when I was applying  for the Marshall.  Well, picking up on those comments Chris, you were fortunate enough to  be selected for the Truman Scholarship and for the Marshall  Scholarship, both very prestigious international scholarships. First of  all, could you describe the two scholarships briefly and how they differ,  the Truman versus the Marshall?  The Truman Scholarship is funded by our federal government, of course,   and is  named in honor of our former President. And each year, the  Truman Foundation selects about seventy-five to eighty students from  around the country who they think show some interest in public service.  The idea is to follow the model of public service that President Truman  set forth and the scholarship is   it was around  30,000 back in my day.  It may have increased a bit now with inflation but it   s intended for  graduate study at any university and as part of that scholarship, you kind  of explain to the committee what you have in mind and why you   d like  to go to graduate school and why the scholarship will help you with that.  So that   s a graduate school scholarship.  The Marshall Scholarship is a scholarship paid for by the British  government. It   s a scholarship that was meant to be a thank you to the  United States for the money we invested in Europe specifically in the  United Kingdom after World War II with the Marshall Plan. So, it   s a  scholarship where the British government, through the Marshall  selection committees, find about forty students a year from around the  United States and those scholars are then given basically a couple of  years worth of scholarship money for any university in the United  Kingdom. I attended Oxford and Cambridge within England but also  10  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  occasionally, a student will go to Scotland or to Wales or to Northern  Ireland, so it   s a scholarship paid for by the British government to study  in England. Just chronologically here, I was able to do the Marshall  Scholarship and come back to law school and use the money from the  Truman Scholarship to pay for a semester or two at a private law school.  That   s great. How did your participation in the Scholars Program  prepare you for competition for the Truman and the Marshall  scholarships?  Well, the involvement through the Scholar Development Program was  essential for me. It came about in a couple of ways. I think early on,  even as a freshman or sophomore and I was describing the Windows to  the World class, it   s so helpful for a program to give younger students  some context of what these scholarships are and basically to make them  a little more realistic. When I came to school and I heard about these, I  thought those types of scholarships may be reserved for elite private  schools on the east or west coast. It was very helpful first of all to know  that students from Oklahoma State had won those, and then second of all  that Dr. Graalman and other faculty mentors had helped those students.  It helps on the front end just to give students a sense of what the  scholarships are and that they are within reach.  Later on, when you   re applying for the scholarships, it   s very helpful to  bounce ideas off of Dr. Graalman or these other faculty mentors maybe  within your college and the Scholar Development Program was  particularly useful in providing some input and comments on the  application materials and the essays and coordinating those application  materials. Then, also once you apply and you   re able to make it to an  interview round, to prepare practice interviews and help to give you a  sense of what you might expect with those interviews. You   ve got to get  through the door first of all with your application, but at least with the  Truman and the Marshall, there   s an interview involved too and again,  that can be a mysterious process if you   ve not spoken with anyone  who   s been through there. Dr. Graalman helped me (and I know he does  still) to organize several practice interviews for students who are getting  ready.  And Chris, in context around that application, you mentioned there were  essays. Some people think of an application as maybe a two or three  page form you fill out. That   s not the kind of application you   re talking  about, is it?  No, and again, I   m trying to go back to what the application involved. I  know for the Truman, because it is geared more toward government  service, you   re basically asked to provide a policy statement on some  11  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  area of government policy you might propose to be changed or some  area that you   d like to study, so a good part of that application is  involved with a fairly detailed policy statement on this area where you  have some focus. And then you also have some other shorter essay  questions. I know for the Marshall at the time when I applied, there was  also a personal statement involved which was relatively short, but  because it played such an important role, even though it was only maybe  a few pages, it really took a lot of planning and brainstorming with Dr.  Graalman and others to identify kind of how you wanted to portray  yourself or how you wanted to construct that personal statement.  And, the mock interviews, I understand those could be pretty brutal  sometimes? The professors there at OSU would help work on those.  Could you explain that?  Yes, I think that   s the idea. I think the idea would be that you go through  the practice interviews and your actual interview is in fact easier than  what you   d come to expect from the practice interviews. Of course, we  can   t predict with any certainty what the questions will be from the  committee, but what we can do is try to simulate that environment.  Sometimes that means being fairly rude during the interview or cutting  the interviewee off or maybe challenging the student on issues the  student raised or maybe posing contrary views and seeing how the  student responds or maybe posing a fairly esoteric question that you  realize the student wouldn   t know but just seeing how the student  responds when confronted with that awkward question that you don   t  know the answer to. I think the idea there is to give the student some  sense of what it   s like to be in front of a handful of professional  strangers who may try to do their best to make you feel silly or to  challenge you or to challenge your beliefs. It   s very helpful and I think  the more times you go through that, the more comfortable you feel when  you go up to the actual committee interview.  It   s rumored that Bob Spurrier was pretty tough on those.  He was and I don   t remember if he had been on one of my practice  interviews, but I do think that some of the folks on campus would take  some pleasure from the interviews. (Laughter)  How many mock interviews would you do?  Gosh, again   I   d like to think at least one or two for each of the  scholarships. Those would be in front of Dr. Graalman and faculty  members on campus or maybe students who   d been through the  scholarship before. I know just from email correspondence this year, for  some of the students Dr. Graalman would try to coordinate at least a  12  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  couple of interviews for each student who was getting ready to  interview, to give them some sense from two different panels of what  types of questions could be expected.  Could you imagine going through this process as an applicant without  having had that preparation background from the Scholar Development  Program?  I think the short answer would probably be no. It would be very difficult  and pretty frightening to take a stab at that alone, so I think the program  is extraordinarily helpful to help students feel more comfortable and to  let them know about these opportunities and help to prepare them.  Chris, could you take us through sort of a personal perspective, if you  can recall back your feelings going through the process for the Truman,  and then for the Marshall? And the process, if I understand the Truman,  you had to be selected amongst other students from Oklahoma State?  That   s right.  Two or three would go forward, so you   d have to go through that but  could you take us through the process and what you remember, your  personal perspective about it?  Sure, sure. I remember with each step   and maybe it   s because of a  smaller town ag background or I think a lot of it is just the modesty that  a lot of us have at Oklahoma State, I was pleasantly surprised with each  step. The Truman was certainly a scholarship that I was interested in. I  applied as one of the school candidates as you described, two or three  would be selected to move on for national consideration. I applied and  went through that initial round of interviews and felt good to be selected  as one of our university candidates. I think there was some level of self-doubt  or skepticism whenever I was going up to interview against  students who were from around the country and came from private  schools around the country, for the Truman selection. I thought the  interview with the Truman went reasonably well, but I didn   t come out  of there feeling like I had done the best interview I had ever done and  then was just surprised and shocked to be chosen for a Truman back in  1998.  At that point, I developed a little more confidence but I thought,    I   m  interested in graduate school.    A lot of the Trumans from my year were  applying for the Marshall and the Rhodes Scholarships, and I thought,    I  have nothing to lose.    I looked at both of the applications and decided  the Marshall was a little bit better fit for me just given the program or  two that I learned about at Cambridge. And again, I interviewed and was  13  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  surprised and pleased to advance as one of our university candidates.  With the Marshall interview, it was in Houston on a cold day in, I guess  back in late 1998, and I thought that interview actually went fairly  poorly. I was quite confident that I had not won a scholarship and was  preparing to take a job and kind of move on and then come back to  graduate school maybe in another year or two and then was frankly  shocked when I found out in late November or early December of    98  that I   d been chosen to go to England the next fall. With each step it was  incredibly humbling but also a confidence builder in a strange way too,  at the same time just to be recognized on a personal level, but also for  the university to be recognized and to confirm that we can compete with  any of these universities around the country.  So in each one of those scholarships, you had just one round of  interviews and you actually just went right to the national selection  level. How many people would typically come in for an interview?  At least when I was involved with the Truman Scholarship, you would  apply based on your state; either the state where you were in school or  the state where you were from. As an Oklahoma candidate, there was  another young lady chosen that year with me from Oklahoma. We had  regional interviews down in Dallas-Ft. Worth for Texas, Oklahoma,  maybe another state or two. And I don   t recall. I think roughly, if I  remember my numbers right, for every Truman that   s named, they  probably interview two, maybe a couple more or so, so there may have  been four, five, six people from Oklahoma being interviewed for a  Truman. The committee at the same time would be interviewing students  from Texas, maybe Louisiana or another adjacent state, so     It was a regional competition. You were selected from a region.  That   s right. It was regional, but at the same time, there   s really just a  cap nationwide, so   with the Truman for example, (at least as I  remember it at the time) there was no minimum requirement that  Oklahoma had to have a Truman Scholar that year. Our year, there were  two. Some years there aren   t any from Oklahoma, so it just depends. It   s  not necessarily allocated by state. For the Marshall, it was again done on  a regional basis in Texas with Oklahoma, Texas and one or two other  adjacent states. It   s my understanding that the regional committee would  prioritize or select a group of students that would be submitted to the  national committee. They would take as many as the national committee  thought appropriate, so I think there was in some way some guarantee of  a certain number of students coming from the Houston, Texas region,  but I think there is a little bit of flexibility as to how many come from a  particular region each year.  14  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  Chris, on the regional scholarships, after you interviewed, did you know  at the end of the interview whether you   d been accepted or not?  No, no. It was quite some time. With the Truman it was at least a couple  of weeks because, as you can imagine, there are more than a dozen  regional committees meeting around the country, then the scholars are  announced at once, so those committees would often meet over a two to  three week period. Then at the end, the Truman Foundation would  announce the scholars at one time. With the Marshall, it was again, at  least a couple of weeks, so no. You have to agonize for a while.  Sweat it out? Obviously you were very successful in the competition.  How did your participation in the Scholar Program impact you  personally and help you develop as a student and as an individual?  I think the scholarship program and the application for some of these  scholarships are helpful regardless of the results, and I don   t mean to be  disingenuous saying that because I was lucky enough to win, but in any  event, developing the personal statement that I was talking about earlier  or trying to formulate the graduate school plans, those are good things  that carry over into any type of graduate school application. I think the  interviews, the practice interviews for the scholarships, are a good thing  that help you to think on your feet and are very transferrable to whatever  you want to do. I also think the process itself, just causing you to think  about what you want to do in the short term and a few years down the  road and long term, are good things too for your own self reflection and  planning. I was lucky enough to come out with a couple of the  scholarships, but I know a lot of students, regardless of the results,  benefit from the program.  What do you say to a student who competed, maybe was selected from  Oklahoma State, got to the regional competition and didn   t make it,  maybe for a couple of scholarships were unsuccessful. I mean, was it  still good for them? What would you say?  I hope it was and I   ve certainly realized from meeting students who won  the scholarships and then going to graduate school to speak with  students who had applied and maybe not won some of them, frankly, to  some extent, the scholarship process at the national level is a bit of a  crapshoot. It   s impossible to be objective, as you can imagine; students  coming in with a whole spectrum of interests and backgrounds and it   s  tough to say two people would have very grounded and reasonable  beliefs to think that an ag econ student with my background should get it  instead of a liberal arts or a humanities major from a private school and  that the other person on that committee may have strong thoughts for the  other person. Because it   s so subjective and in a way arbitrary depending  15  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  on, frankly, whether your interests jelled or matched up in some way  with the interests or the dynamics of the committee members. It   s just  impossible to predict. I try to tell students at that level, there   s just a  certain element of chance and of luck. The best we can do is help you to  feel prepared going in there. That you   ve done everything you can do at  the time do be ready for the interview and beyond that, it   s up to the  committee and sometimes it   s hard to explain.  It   s kind of what you said, Chris, taking your words   you   re saying that  the process that you go through helped you focus your life, short term,  longer term goals   a little bit about what your priorities were in life so  a person who, even if they didn   t get a scholarship, they would go  through the same process and it would shape them as well?  I would hope so and like I said earlier, just on a practical level, some of  the application materials, like the personal statement, can be useful for  graduate schools regardless of how the scholarship turns out. I think the  self reflection and the writing skills you develop through the program  are transferrable skills that will stay with you regardless of whether  you   re in England at the time or back here on one of the scholarships. I  think you   re going to learn something from it and I hope it   s a positive  experience for the students. I think it, in almost every occasion, is  because you develop some of these interview skills and writing skills  that are good.  What do you think should be the goals of the Scholar Development  Program? What should be the desired outcomes for the program from  your perspective as a successful participant?  A couple of the goals that come to my mind from the beginning are first  of all, to help inform our students about these opportunities and to let  them know that students in very similar backgrounds to them have been  competitive and have won at national and international levels with these  scholarships. I think part of it is I talked about the modesty of our  students earlier, but at least for myself as a smaller town student in the  College of Ag, I needed someone to plant a seed or to believe in me a  little bit; that I could achieve at that level. I think that one goal I have for  the program is to help those students look a little differently at  themselves in the mirror. To help them to realize that they can apply and  be competitive and that I think on the back end, when the students are  actually going through the process, I think the program is set up and I  think one of the goals certainly should be to help these students develop  what I keep saying are the transferrable skills: the writing skills with  your essays or personal statements for graduate school and the interview  skills to be able to think on your feet and respond to hostile questions  and contrary arguments. Those types of things seem important to me and  16  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  seem to be skills that last well beyond what you do at Oklahoma State.  And as you said earlier, maybe also just how they look at life and  themselves and their priorities going down the road.  That   s right.  In your opinion, what have been the strengths and successes of the  scholar program through the years? You probably looked at it as a  participant and I   m sure Bob   s engaged your help with students in years  past. Coming back, what do you think have been the strengths and  weaknesses of the program?  I think one of the strengths has to be Bob Graalman himself, who   s been  involved with the program now and developed such an understanding of  the scholarship programs and the opportunities available that he   s a great  resource for students who are coming in and interested in graduate  school or international study. When you talk about the good things of the  program, I think that   s one of the areas where you start. I also think the  program has built up momentum where a real strength now is the  number of faculty mentors we have and not just mentors who are willing  to help out when the student   s getting ready for interviews, but faculty  who are willing and excited to find students when they   re graduating  high school seniors coming in to the college or freshmen there on  campus who have what they think are the talent and the ability to  succeed at the higher level, and to be able to challenge them and  encourage them to go talk to Dr. Graalman or others in their college  about some of these other opportunities. So I think the program   s  developed enough momentum where we have satellite posts in the  different schools that are helping to identify students who may be able to  succeed at some of these and be able to funnel them in through Dr.  Graalman and to at least be aware of some of the scholarships. I think  those are a couple of the real strengths I see in the program.  Do you feel like that through some of the buzz that   s created about it,  does it help recruit or attract some academically gifted students to  Oklahoma State?  I think it does. I think it certainly helps for the small subset of students  who have maybe some of these scholarships on their mind as a high  school senior and I said earlier, maybe through Dr. Holley I did, but I  wasn   t aware much. I think for a certain number of students who  are   certainly interested in graduate school, maybe interested in one of these  scholarships. I think it   s a great sign to these students that OSU first of  all has a track record through the program of producing students who are  capable and succeeding with these programs. But also, that there   s some  17  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  type of institutional program or structure where these students don   t  have to fight the battle themselves, where there are resources and folks  available both in your college and through Dr. Graalman in the Office of  Scholar Development who can help you prepare as well as you could  prepare at any other school to be competitive for these scholarships.  Who are some other students that were successful in the program the  years you were going through?  When I was there on campus, Shannon Ferrell and Blaine Greteman  were both in the program. Shannon won a Truman and Blaine won a  Rhodes while I was on campus. They were either a year ahead of me or  right there at the same time. And then, fortunately we had a pretty good  streak with the Trumans for several years there. Those students come to  my mind first with folks who had won some of the national scholarships,  but I know there are others who were winning some of the Udalls and  some of the others. I just didn   t get to know them as well on campus.  Sometimes success creates its own problems. Since many universities  offer programs similar to Oklahoma State University   s now, because  we   ve been so successful and they model some of their programs after  our Scholar Development Programs, it   s always been pretty tough  competition; it   s become pretty fierce competition nationally for these  scholarships. What changes do you think OSU will need to make in the  future? What components will need to be enhanced to remain  competitive?  I don   t think there is one prescription to be or remain competitive. From  the momentum and the buzz that the scholarships program has  developed, I think it   s easy to have some type of expectation each year  that we   ll have another Rhodes Scholar or another Truman Scholar or  something like that. I think even with the very best preparation, and I  think Dr. Graalman and his colleagues on campus prepare students as  well as anywhere in the country   to get back to my earlier comments,  that it   s a fairly arbitrary process at the national level. Some years even  with the best of intentions, for whatever reason, a student won   t be  selected. I think moving on, the only thing we can do is continue to  ensure that the students have the very best awareness and mentoring that  they can have. I think one of those tools maybe for some type of more  permanent assurance of funding through Graalman   s office with some  type of an endowment or money set aside to continue that program after  he leaves campus because the program, at least as I   ve been involved  with it in the last ten years, really started from Dr. Graalman   s growth  when he was back in the Office of Scholarships. There are certainly a lot  of faculty mentors now but I think you can say safely he is a point  person for these, so I want to be sure the funding and the momentum are  18  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  Gill  in place so that one of these days the transition will be smooth whenever  he decides to end what   s been a great career there at Oklahoma State.  Before we leave Oklahoma State,  are there  any favorite memories, any  highlights for you? Aside from, of course, you winning the scholarships  I   m sure.  Yes, well I had a lot of great memories. I   m trying to think back to some  of our athletic teams and I was there on campus when Big Country   Bryant Reeves  and the team came back from Seattle after they had  won in the Elite Eight to qualify for the Final Four. I was in Gallagher  Iba   when was that?    95 or so?     95.  When students and the community welcomed the team back at one or  two o   clock in the morning when they had just flown back in from  Seattle and people were floating kegs out at Theta Pond and throwing  toilet paper all around campus over there on the south side. Those are  some of the neat athletic memories from a lot of good games in  Gallagher-Iba. A lot of good games there when Coach Simmons was  around with the football team. And just a lot of great memories from  friends on campus, developing new friends and, like a lot of folks there,  I met my wife on campus. Amy and I have a lot of fondness for  Oklahoma State and try to get back as much as we can.  Is there a story there of how you met Amy?  We met through mutual friends. She takes pride in saying she   s the one  who asked me out first to one of these sorority date parties, but no, we  met through mutual friends and eventually started dating around  Homecoming back in   97. It   s hard to believe now; it   s been a long time.  Been awhile. Kind of fast-forward a little bit, Chris, after graduating  from OSU in December    98,  what did you do ?  I finished my undergrad at that time. Just a few weeks before that I had  gotten word that I have received the Marshall Scholarship, so I knew  with that Marshall I   d be going overseas in September of the next year.  Instead of trying to find a job for about eight or nine months there I just  stayed on campus and took some graduate courses and then actually  finished coursework in May of    99.  Can you share some highlights of your graduate experiences because  you were at Cambridge and then at Oxford, as well?  19  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  Gill  That   s right. I was at Cambridge from the fall of    99 through 2000 and  the next year I was at Oxford. Those places have so much history. The  programs I was in were, at Cambridge, a land economy program which  was closer to what I   d done in ag economics. Then at Oxford, I was  enrolled in a program called Comparative Social Policy. The programs  were rather different. The first program was one that was more closely  related and I studied a lot harder and traveled less. Then the second year,  by that time, Amy and I had gotten married and had the opportunity with  that program to get out and travel quite a bit more. The programs are so  different in the sense I was in different cities in the second year, Amy  was there and we traveled quite a bit more doing backpacking around  Europe. I have a lot of good memories and met a lot of neat people  through both of the schools and I   d love to get back one of these days to  visit campus.  In your wildest dreams, did a boy from Guthrie and Chickasha,  Oklahoma ever think you   d be at Oxford and Cambridge Universities?  No, no, no. It   s pretty overwhelming still to think about it.  It   s very interesting. What was, in your mind, the major difference  between the two schools? Just the experience part of it, not your  graduate education.  Yes, at the time, this was about ten years ago now, but at the time, this is  before   the Gates Scholarship has started now which brings a lot more  American and international students to Cambridge   at the time, there  really weren   t many Cambridge students from the US, so I was in a  college called Saint John   s. There were several hundred of us in the  college, but really only a handful of people from the States. I was an  international student and Cambridge is probably the more rural and I  would kind of think it as more of the Oklahoma State versus Oxford in  more of the bigger city with OU  University of Oklahoma , and I think  it   s the prettier of the two schools. At Oxford at the time, there were  many more American students and you felt like it was a bigger city just  in terms of the size of the community, so it was easier to live a graduate  school life like you would have here in a way in the States. By that time  Amy had come over and we were married and I spent a fair amount of  time with some of the other American students, but it was different in  terms of the student population and the influence of the States. You   re  really kind of out on your own there at Cambridge versus a more  American version at Oxford.  So, I mean that   s prestigious enough; you went to Cambridge and  Oxford and then you go to law school at Yale.  20  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  That   s right.  At what point did you decide for sure you wanted to go to law school  and apply to Yale?  I think it was at the end of Oklahoma State and getting overseas, where I  was trying to think about the next step and I had in mind some type of  graduate school, but earlier I thought if I don   t win a fellowship to go  overseas, I may work a year or two and then go to graduate school. But,  around the time I got over to England, I started thinking more seriously  and talking to other students who were over there about law school and  decided to take the exam for law school. I actually applied to law school  from Oxford when I was living there.  Pretty exciting.  It was. It was exciting and again, it was a humbling experience in the  sense that I thought why not at least try applying to schools like Yale or  Harvard and if that doesn   t work, I   m just fine to come back to a school  here in the Midwest. But I was lucky enough to get in and I enjoyed it.  Looking down the road a little, where do you think your legal career will  take you? Or first of all, maybe I ought to state, where has your legal  career taken you to this point after Yale?  When I graduated in 2004, I worked two years as a law clerk to Judge  Robert Henry. He   s a judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. He   s  a federal judge. After I worked as a law clerk for him, I went to a local  law firm here in Oklahoma City. It   s called Crowe and Dunlevy. I was  there not quite two years and then came to my current job in the US  Attorney   s Office here in Oklahoma City. Now my official title is  Assistant US Attorney. I   m a federal prosecutor for federal criminal  offenses; right now, more violent offenses: guns and drugs and bank  robberies.  Did you think you   d be that part of the legal profession?  No, it   s been another surprise.  That   s great. Are you enjoying it?  I am.  I guess maybe    enjoy    is not the right word, but is it challenging?  Well, it is and it   s a rewarding type of a job where I feel good about  21  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  being able to represent the United States and try to fight for justice.  Back to the other question, where do you think your legal career will  take you or do you intend to stay in the legal profession for your career?  I   d like to, at least here in the short term. I   ve got to do something to  help get the student loans paid off from law school, so I certainly plan to  stay here for several years if they decide to keep me around. I   m  enjoying the legal practice at this point. With a law degree, fortunately,  you   re able to go several different ways. I   d like to stay involved with  government for a little while. At least for now I don   t have any plans to  do anything else.  How has participation in the Scholar  Development  Program and the  Truman and Marshall competitions impacted and influenced the  direction of your life?  It changed it a lot. I said earlier it helps you to look in the mirror a little  differently. I think for me, it allowed me to do things that I frankly  didn   t think were possible coming to Oklahoma State; and when I say  that I mean the chance to study overseas or the chance to go to a law  school at a place like Yale. It gave me the confidence and helped to  equip me with the tools to apply for those scholarships and to put  yourself in a position to be competitive and I think that   s all you can ask.  It really changed. It changed the outlook that I had in terms of what was  available to me with graduate school study and it allowed me to do  things I never thought a guy from Chickasha would do.  When you were down in the Washita River bottom hauling hay, you  didn   t ever think you   d be at Cambridge, right?  That   s right.  Well, looking down the road, Chris, you   ve had significant goals in your  life and have achieved several of those, but what do you hope to  accomplish? What do you hope to contribute to society in your life?  Have you had a chance to think about that much? I know you   re still  young in your career.  Well, I   m older than I look. (Laughs) Like I said earlier, I   d like to  certainly stay here for a few years. I   m enjoying the experience I   m  getting. Down the road, I don   t know what   s in store for me. I plan to  stay involved with the practice of law for some time. Some folks who  have been in these types of jobs have returned to the private sector for  some point and then maybe returned to the office or some people leave  to go to work at the courthouse as a judge or something like that. Those  22  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Stephens  things aren   t easy to predict, particularly opportunities like the judge  positions, but I guess I   ve always had the idea that started well before  the Truman to try to be involved with the community. I don   t mean to  sound cheesy, but something that   s related to public service, that   s  always been important to me. I plan to stick around Oklahoma. I don   t  have any interest or plans to leave at this point, and I keep looking for  jobs that will allow me to try to give back and help make the world a  little better place. For now, this is a job that challenges me and helps me  to feel good about it, so we   ll see. You   ll have to come back in five or  ten years, I guess.  Chris, you   ve accomplished a lot for a person of your age in life, but  looking back in your life now or whenever, twenty years down the road,  how do you hope people will remember Chris Stephens? How do you  want to be remembered?  I hope to be remembered still as that hayseed from Chickasha who had  the good fortune of getting some of these nice awards but didn   t change  as a person and remained the same person who hopefully would be  described as fairly humble and kind and genuine despite the nice resume  or the degrees or whatever else. I hope to be considered a good and  trusted friend and someone who people can count on and be proud of to  represent them in the type of job I do now or to represent them with  what I did at Oklahoma State. I just hope to be that same type of person I  was before I got to Stillwater.  Do you continue your ongoing relationship with Oklahoma State  University?  Well, I hope so. I don   t have much money to offer at this point, but I try  to help in other ways. As I mentioned earlier, it   s certainly a place that  has a lot of fondness in my heart and my family and I try to get back  there as much as we can.  Chris, is there anything that you   d like to discuss or bring up or talk  about that we haven   t included in our conversation?  I don   t think so. I really applaud this type of program to be able to  document this. I have a lot of fondness in my heart for OSU because the  school   s been very good for me and I have a lot of appreciation for that,  for students and faculty who helped me there at school. I owe all the  credit for anything I   ve been able to do with any of the scholarships and  a good part of my professional career to the start that I got at Oklahoma  State. I   ll always be appreciative of that and want to do my small part  down the road to return a favor.  23  Gill  Stephens  Gill  Okay, I appreciate it.  Sure.  Thank you very much.  -------  -------
