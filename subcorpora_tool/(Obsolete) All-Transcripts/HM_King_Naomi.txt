Story_ID: 640527
Speaker 1: Let's begin by talking about your family tree, and I want to start with your mother. Tell me her name, when and where she was born if you know.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Bessie Barber Bailey. I'm not sure, but I think she was born in Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember the date?
Speaker 2: Yes, mom was born June the 14th, 1914.
Speaker 1: Okay, now tell me about your mother? Tell me about your relationship with your mother?
Speaker 2: My mother was certainly a jewel. I was an only child and she thought the, the sun rose and set on me and she gave me the best attention that any mother, you know could give her child and I was just so impressed because I known anything from her but just love. I think I've always been smothered in love and all of the stories that I can think of where my mother was concerned that--she told me that I really liked being an only child, and mom, you know had to pick cotton and she didn't want to leave me with anybody so she said she choose to put me on her cotton sack and I rode on her cotton sack as she picked, you know picked the cotton and all and so I mean that's just so special that I, I can remember that she did not want to leave me with anybody, she wanted to keep me, keep me with her at all times.
Speaker 1: Did she talk to you much about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Not too much because as I remember she, she had brothers and sisters and I'm not sure how many like in number, but I do remember that when we were in our--in Alabama and she had made the decision that we would leave Alabama and come to Atlanta [Georgia] to live with her brother. So it was at that point that I knew more about mama's brother and living with him when we came to Atlanta than I can remember about anybody else.
Speaker 1: So she grew up in--on a farm?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Okay, not sure?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Do you know your grandparents on your mother's side [Verna Barber and Julius Barber], or do you know who they are?
Speaker 2: I don't know any of 'em.
Speaker 1: Do you know their names?
Speaker 2: I know some of--by name I know the, the one brother that we came to--her brother we came to live with his name was Rufus [Rufus Barber (ph.)] and I do remember two of her sisters that, that I can remember we had visited with from time to time and one was named Nancy [Nancy Barber] and one was named Sallie [Sallie Barber].
Speaker 1: And your grandparents, you didn't know their names?
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They don't--okay.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay so tell me about your mother's education?
Speaker 2: Mom had very little education because she, having moved to Atlanta and living with, with her brother and then when it was time to move onto another place of living she met a wonderful friend [Vera Greer (ph.)] and we moved from--with that brother to this friend of hers that we lived there, and that is where she gainfully got employment as a, as a domestic engineer so that she worked, I had--I guessed you know like six or seven days a week and--that so that she could support the two of us and so she only got to go to night school when it was--when she could go to night school. So I'm thinking mom never got any more, in forms of an education, more than the seventh or eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, what do you think the characteristics of your mother that you now possess? What do you think they are?
Speaker 2: Um, her generous, generous love for people and, and just helping wherever she could and she was a wonderful, wonderful cook and she passed that on to me. However, I learned those traits but I didn't necessarily want to keep up with her but she taught me very well because she was an excellent cook, and she was a, a very religious and so we, we thrived on, on, on her--the love that she gave to me down there and we thrived on those.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, let's talk about your father and his side of the family. If you know his name, where he was born, if you know?
Speaker 2: I know very little about my, my father because I'm an only child and I don't think that they were like married, but I don't have you know any, any history on his side. However, I'm told that his father, my father's father was a Cherokee Indian [Native American]. That's about all I know about him.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: What was his name, your father?
Speaker 2: I don't know, don't even know, don't even know his name.
Story_ID: 640528
Speaker 1: Let's move on to when you were born in Alabama and then your mother [Bessie Barber Bailey] moved to Atlanta [Georgia] with you. How old were you when you moved to Atlanta?
Speaker 2: I had to be about, I would say between four and--between four and six because I remember going to school you know at, at you know--elementary school. So I had to be between four and six.
Speaker 1: Okay, and at that time you were living with your [maternal] uncle [Rufus Barber (ph.)]?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Now tell me how long did you live with your uncle? Do you remember how long it might have been?
Speaker 2: It was a few years you know because as I foretasted that when we moved from living with this uncle to this friend of, of my mom's that I, I, I would say between five and six years I would think.
Speaker 1: That you lived there?
Speaker 2: There, I believe so.
Speaker 1: Okay, well at that point you were old enough to go outside and, and know your neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, and friends that you played with.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So tell me about where you lived and tell me about the neighborhood in which you lived?
Speaker 2: Um, having moved in with my mom's friend and all we lived sort of--let's see how I wanna say this, it's sort of a, a kind of--well it wasn't--I guess you'd say it was middle class, I guess it was like middle class because this friend had, had owned a two story home in, in the Southwest section of the city [Atlanta, Georgia] and I was able to enjoy living and playing with friends there because as I said it was kind of like a middle class neighborhood and I was able to have friends and to enjoy playing in that and, and then being exposed with, with my mom's friend who too was a social, was a domestic engineer, but she was kind of like, as what in those days that we called like in the, kind of like in the upper class like, so that between my mom being a domestic worker that she is and then the friend being in kind of like in the, in the upper class of living, who worked for, for, for white folk at that--we said at that time there, so I kind of had a rich, a rich experience because I was able to at that time when I was--at that time there were four or five children in this white family where both my mother and my friend, her friend worked, and I was able to always get the--like--the daughter, oh the daughter and I were about the same age and so that when it was time for her to get a new wardrobe, you know I always got the--got her wardrobe because she got a second time, so I was always able to be at that time and at that place be well dressed and, and enjoy good you know, good neighborhood and playing with good friends.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the street that you lived on?
Speaker 2: Yes, I lived at 435 McDaniel Street, in what we call Mechanicsville [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Who were--you say your mother's friend, do you remember her name?
Speaker 2: Yeah, her name was Vera Greer [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember some of your friends on McDaniel Street?
Speaker 2: None of them really by name, but I do remember one dear friend who lived, whereas I said I lived in Mechanicsville, there was another section that we called, when you go across the railroad tracks so to speak. So I lived across the first set of railroad tracks and then the second set of railroad tracks I had a dear friend there named Catherine Griffin [ph.].
Speaker 1: What about the neighborhood and you, you say it's probably, was probably considered middle class. If you were to take me on a tour, say a square block, tell me what I would see? Who, who owned the stores and what, what do you remember about the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: I remember from--as I said the house in which we live then which was, I guess you could call it community living that my mama's friend had then. It was two story, which was very nice and then all of the other houses on the street were pretty much equivalent to that home, so they were very, you know, nice homes and I wouldn't say slums or anything like that, but just, just nice and then at Mechanicsville where I lived you had just stores, grocery stores and funeral homes and, and churches.
Speaker 1: So tell me who owned the funeral home and what little stores you went in? Do you remember any of the owners of the stores?
Speaker 2: I don't remember any of the owners, but I do remember one of the funeral homes that was very popular in that time was, it was called Sellers Brothers [Sellers Brothers Funeral Home, Atlanta, Georgia] and I think there were two or three brothers or something, but I do remember one that was named Sellers Brothers.
Story_ID: 640529
Speaker 1: What elementary school did you attend?
Speaker 2: I went to Walker Street school, was Walker Street Elementary [Walker Street Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of the teachers there?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you remember your experience in elementary school? What type of student were you?
Speaker 2: I, I do remember my being always eager to, to learn as much as I can and the teachers were you know very helpful and I did pay attention and, and did very well I think as a student at Walker Street.
Speaker 1: Did you have any--participate in any extracurricular activities, you know were--I mean music, dance anything like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at that time I was still living with my friend [Vera Greer (ph.)]. I've always loved music and dancing is my first love, I loved dancing and dancing's my love first, but I loved music and I do remember taking piano lessons at 435 McDaniel Street and was doing very well until I got to the point where--I lived upstairs, that was where we lived because the house was in like different rooms, different tenants had different rooms and I had gotten to the point that I wanted to have my own piano so that I could advance as a piano student and I do remember at that time we could not get a piano because of the stairs, the way it was, and they couldn't get the piano up the, up the stairs into our apartment where we lived and at--so after that since I couldn't get the piano at that time to continue my lessons my interest waned.
Story_ID: 640530
Speaker 1: The house that you lived in sounds very interesting. Can you give me a description of how, you know, how it was broken down, how many levels, rooms (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Were there bathrooms for everybody or did you share bathrooms or kitchens? Share with me about that.
Speaker 2: It was, as I said a community type house where that--all the tenants had their own separate room, bedroom or what have you, but there was the bathroom upstairs for those people living upstairs, and then there was a bathroom downstairs for the ones that were living downstairs and we had a kitchen now, and everybody shared the kitchen and everybody shared the living room area.
Speaker 1: Did you prepare meals together, did you all eat together or each family?
Speaker 2: No each family was separate (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Separate.
Speaker 2: They had their own. My mom [Bessie Barber Bailey] did all the cooking, as I said she was a great cook and all so she did all the cooking, but everybody ate separately.
Speaker 1: And many of the houses you say on that street [McDaniel Street, Atlanta, Georgia] were the same type of, of set up as far as living?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh right. They were not all two stories but they--but like single levels but they were all very nice.
Speaker 1: What about parks or any other recreation outside of school? Can you remember any of that?
Speaker 2: Outside of school?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: At that time segregation was, was very much alive and well, and we only had I guess it was like, like one park that Negroes could probably go to at that time and we would frequent that one park you know over there, which was all in the section of the town where, where the Negroes lived.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the park?
Speaker 2: I remember Washington Park [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Do you remember--well this, during this time we're still in the Depression [Great Depression], do you remember anything about that or even knowing, because you are young, a young child and most young people don't--they're not aware of their, you know what's going on around them, but did you have any awareness of the Depression?
Speaker 2: I have no aware- of the Depression because as I said earlier my mom being a domestic worker and all, I really, never really missed anything or felt you know short of lacking anything because of, of her, her work and her lifestyle that all our needs to everything was cared for so I really don't remember anything like that.
Speaker 1: You, you said that you were able to get the clothes that were handed down from the white family.
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Very nice things.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you always dressed very nice.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did she also, was she able to also bring home food from some of the parties that she might have worked it, at during you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Being at the white folk's home?
Speaker 2: Yes, they could always, they could always bring food.
Speaker 1: Was there anything in particular that you remember that you had never eaten that she might've brought, brought home?
Speaker 2: I guess, only what you call delicacies or game or whatever, but having been exposed to things like duck and squab and pigeon and you know all those, the lamb and all those kinds of things, I was not really you know accustomed to eating that type of thing, but I got exposed to it because whenever there were like parties and stuff mom would always you know bring something home to me so I got exposed to it.
Story_ID: 640531
Speaker 1: So as an only child how did you entertain yourself? Did you read a lot?
Speaker 2: I always, as, as I said been able to entertain myself whenever because I did read a lot and then my love for music at that time was working like you know with music and my mom [Bessie Barber Bailey] always saw to it that I was around people that were doing things that was like constructive or you know, that kept me busy while she was away at work and so it was just always something to do and I was never bored.
Speaker 1: What were some of the things that you participated in? What were some of the things that you liked to do?
Speaker 2: Now?
Speaker 1: No, as, no as a child--then.
Speaker 2: Then?
Speaker 1: Like when your mother was away at work, what were some of the things that you did beside music?
Speaker 2: Yeah, aside--when she was, you know was at work and there I would get a chance to go to, depending on like what was happening, I'd get a chance to go to whatever movies that was appropriate for you know for me to see and then I could get to go to the library [in Atlanta, Georgia] and pick out some of my favorite books that I, you know that I liked to, that I liked to, you know to read at that time and that was really, you know pretty much that was it--my way was spent 'cause by the time you get from school and you do whatever few activities you have then it's time to go to bed so--it's not too much to do.
Speaker 1: Radio programs, did you listen to the radio?
Speaker 2: Only listened--I think anything that was musical that I could always hear I would turn that on and I do remember one radio at that time, that was a program called the, 'The Shadow' and I use to like to watch 'The Shadow' and so that was about it.
Story_ID: 640532
Speaker 1: So the next school that you go to, do you go to middle school or do you go straight from elementary [Walker Street Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia] into high school?
Speaker 2: No, I went to middle school to Davis Street School [Atlanta, Georgia], middle school.
Speaker 1: And tell me about that experience?
Speaker 2: That was a real experience, I enjoyed that because having finished elementary and then go to middle school, I was able to go up on another, another level and, and I enjoyed all of the, the whatever--activities that they offered at that time you know if it was sports or whatever, I enjoyed whatever was going on at the time at the middle school.
Speaker 1: Were you involved in sports at all?
Speaker 2: Not a whole lot, but I would go to the games and stuff you know and be a spectator.
Speaker 1: Okay, so were your piano lessons still going on now or had you finished by that time?
Speaker 2: I had finished by that time.
Speaker 1: Okay in school, did you have music in school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was--I joined the chorus 'cause I loved music and singing so I was always involved in, in a chorus.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of the teachers from your middle school?
Speaker 2: Not from middle school I remember, but I do remember my English teacher from high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Atlanta, Georgia], Mrs. Williams [ph.], I enjoyed that and then I do remember me in the chorus, Ms. Groves [ph.] was who was the other teacher. Those were about the only two and I remember the principal at that time it was C.N. Cornell.
Speaker 1: And that's at the middle school [sic.], do you remember the principal from your elementary school?
Speaker 2: No, no (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, and what type of student were you in middle school?
Speaker 2: In middle school I've always been like B plus to an A minus in--throughout school, from elementary, middle and high school.

Speaker 2: Favorite, I guess I really liked English the most with Ms. Williams.
Speaker 1: Did you like to write?
Speaker 2: I loved to write. I still try to dabble at it now, not- nothing major but I do like it.
Speaker 1: So anything else interesting happen during middle school?
Speaker 2: No, nothing, nothing, nothing too much in middle school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And neither like high school except for the things that I mentioned that I enjoyed doing in high school.
Story_ID: 640533
Speaker 1: Now in the South of course segregation is, is very much present. Do you have any stories about any time that you might have felt discriminated against?
Speaker 2: I can think of several, I can remember one when my husband [Alfred Daniel Williams King], and at that time when we were dating.
Speaker 1: Who--
Speaker 2: I remember, I, I--he loved you know to take me to movies and so I remember one particular time I told him I wanted to go to the Fox Theatre [Atlanta, Georgia], which was segregated then and I wanted to see a movie, 'Blue Skies,' and so when I told him that he said, "I can't take you to that." He said, "That's segregated." He said, "Because--I can't take you to see 'Blue Skies.'" I said, "Why not?" He said, "Because my father [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.], you know, he just doesn't, we don't support segregation. We don't believe in that, so I'm sorry I can't take you, but I'll take you to, you know to any of the, you know black theaters you know that's going on." So me being me I just decided, I said, "Well, I'll go myself," you know. I said, "You don't have to take me I'll go myself." So I remember going--it was a beautiful day, I don't remember when it was, but it was a beautiful day and at the Fox at that time there were stairs. I think those stairs still exist, I'm not sure that, that blacks had to go up the stairs and climb the stairs to go, you know to get into the movie, while the whites were going through the front doors down on the lower steps, and so I was about halfway up the, up the stairs when a shower came you know, and, and me being able to dress well at that time--I remember, 'cause my mother [Bessie Barber Bailey] kept me very neat and all the time and I am always still am. I remember I had on this beautiful dress. I don't know what kind it was but it was beautiful and ironed and starched and just, just pretty, and by the time I got halfway, the rains came and there was nowhere to go, you know to go from the rain and all so that means I had to continue going on up the stairs until the entry, and by the time I got up the stairs where the entry was I was like soaking, soaking wet and my beautiful starched dress was just like dripping. So I went on in the movie, but I couldn't enjoy it because you know because I got wet and then I, the white folk were down on the other level safe and dry and here I was like wet going up the steps and all that. So when I got back and I, and I was talking to my boyfriend at that time. I told him, he said, "No better for you." He said, "You had no business going no way" (laughter).
Speaker 1: You know growing up though, I'm just gonna go back because I, I wanna stay in the--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --junior--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --high era, but during that time was there anything? I mean it was like just a way of life for you, but I want you to explain to me--did your parents have to tell you there were certain places that you could go or things that you--or was it just the way of life?
Speaker 2: Well, before I was married then and got into another type of lifestyle, my mom would caution me on, on every level. She would caution me on every level and I do remember her saying several times like, you know she said, "Well, you can't go this place and you can't go that place because you don't have a brother." She said, "If you had a brother," she said, "I could trust you to go with your brother, but I can't take you because I have to work to take care of the two of us, and so you can't, just, there's some things you can't do," so it was just a matter of always getting to no--saying no, or, "You can't do this because of this and that," but you know we worked through it.
Story_ID: 640534
Speaker 1: So, tell me a little more about living in the time of segregation, and we're still talking about the time when you might've been twelve, thirteen, fourteen years old in junior high school [Davis Street School, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Okay, during that time being twelve you know, twelve and thirteen, I never really, never really felt segregated against myself you know because of, of the lifestyle and the way I was sheltered all of my life you know, but I do remember in passing from time to time that--maybe like in traveling--where you would have--well if you passed the restroom where they would have colored and white or if you passed a water fountains you know where they'd have black and white and all that. So my mom [Bessie Barber Bailey] being the type of protective mother that she always, always saw to it that I never even really, really, really had to stop you know for--except maybe for going to the bathroom or nothing but--because you know we'd have lunches and stuff that--all my needs were--like you know taken, you know taken care of but I do remember one thing in particular, one incident (unclear) that I was going--I decided that I wanted to go in, in one of these sandwich shops and get me a sandwich 'cause I couldn't--remember, so I do remember walking, I don't remember where it was or the name of the place but I do remember walking into the place and I went in and I think I wanted to order a hamburger or hotdog or something, and I was told that, that I couldn't be served there you know because they didn't serve black, you know black folks and all, that I'd have to come out of--go back out and come around to the side is where you placed--blacks served their orders and they'd hand it to you through a little window you know, out through there and so I did walk out and then I, well I was by myself. I did walk out and I didn't tell my mom about it, but I walked out and I went around to the side 'cause I wasn't gonna buy but I just wanted to see you know what was there and how it was offered. So it was just as they said, they had a window there that you'd go up and you'd place your order and then they would give you your order out the window, and when I looked at it, that hurt my feelings so bad I said, "I can't spend my money here." I said, "No." I just turned around and I left. Now that is about the only time I can remember being segregated against and, and felt bad.
Speaker 1: And, and basically it's--what you're saying is that your mother always made provisions so that you wouldn't have to experience those things.
Speaker 2: Right, absolutely.
Story_ID: 640535
Speaker 1: What high school do you go to?
Speaker 2: I went to Booker T. Washington High [Booker T. Washington High School, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay and tell me about your experience, and who were some of your friends, and are you still living in the same place?
Speaker 2: I was--in, in high school I was still living in the same place, 435 McDaniel Street, where I was living there and, and a lot of my friends who have passed away now, but I had about six or seven of them, but I can't remember all of their names, but I had about six or seven friends that we were like close together and we always sticked together kind of like a band so that you know we could look out for each other so to speak because you--in that time you really had, you had little gangs and violence and stuff like that you know, and then among the blacks you know and that you know and so in order for us to stay out of that we sort of--the six or seven of us kept to ourselves and stayed out of that you know to avoid that type of violence and history. And I remember, I think it was three, only three names that I can remember that I recall--Catherine Keith [ph.] was one I mentioned to you earlier, Louise Barber [ph.] was a, was one that had--we had the same name but we were not related and all, Louise Barber, and then there was one, one fellow. His name was Frank Anderson [ph.].
Speaker 1: And what were some of the things that you did as a, as a teenager outside of school?
Speaker 2: Outside of school? I loved as I said going to movies. I loved, I loved going to see plays when they were there, anything musical that I, that I could participate in 'cause music was there and then we had the regular parties then, you know house parties that you would go to from that, so between that, the--that's about--and in church I was a--I loved going to church and so I loved--participated in all my church activities [at Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia]. So that was about it for me.
Story_ID: 640536
Speaker 1: And, well let's talk about church. What church did you attend?
Speaker 2: I attended Ebenezer Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia] and I joined that church in 1947, and my mother [Bessie Barber Bailey] and I both joined there at '47 [1947], 1947, and Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr. was our, our pastor and we really were involved in as many of the church activities that we could fit into and organizations that I could fit into, so we were just grounded in church.
Speaker 1: Was there a church that you attended before Ebenezer?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, so actually you were a teenager getting ready to graduate from high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Before you joined (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --Ebenezer?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right, what music were you listening to during that time 'cause now we're in 19--in the 1940s so what, what music are you listening to and?
Speaker 2: Mostly gospel, well I loved gospels and the radio you know--what is it, the FM stations where you can get different degrees of music, of--that was, that was pretty much it.
Speaker 1: Okay and you said plays. Where did they have plays here during that time?
Speaker 2: During that time we had a lot of plays at our church, you know and we brought in--we used a lot of our members you know as actors and actresses in that and so whatever play that pretty much was talked about at that time was talked about, that's what we would always look, go out and seek after and then bring it to our church, so as I said that I was pretty much grounded in church and stayed there.
Speaker 1: Okay, the World War [World War II, WWII] was going on also as you were coming up. Were you or your family impacted by it at all, or any of the people in your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.

Speaker 1: So in high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Atlanta, Georgia], you continue to be a great student. Were there any other interests that you picked up in your high school years?
Speaker 2: Well, I found at that time toward the tenth or the eleventh grade I guess it was, I have an art, a love for interior decorating so I started then taking classes and looking into--because that is what I wanted to do with, with my work, was being an interior decorator so anything that I could get myself started in and that would enhance those, those classes when that's what I did.
Speaker 1: Were you guided into what college you would go to? Had you thought about college? When did you think that you might even go to college?
Speaker 2: I had planned, I had thought about it I guess toward the eleventh grade and all when I decided to go, that I would go to Spelman College here in Atlanta, Georgia and I did go to Spelman College for one year.
Speaker 1: What was the process like from, from high school? I mean how did you prepare to, to go and was this a school that had to be paid for? How, how did you pay for college the first year?
Speaker 2: It was, you had to prepare for it and that's been some time ago and I don't really you know remember the expenses and what have you, but it was worked out, you know my mom [Bessie Barber Bailey] had gone and made the preparations you know and gave the tuition and whatever and then we'd--she'd pay for it by the month.
Speaker 1: And so tell me about your graduation and your prom before we go on to Spelman. Did you go to the prom?
Speaker 2: I went to the--my high school prom?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went and it was a lot of fun and, and there were parties, numerous parties and one thing that was impressive that stayed with me was there's--my date at time for the prom was Leon Jones [ph.] and having been, as I keep going back to, being what I call was like maybe well dressed at that time like that. The first thing my mom said was well--when she met Leon Jones and all, she wanted to know what he would be wearing you know for the prom you know, said because she wanted us to dress in like colors and so he said that he would wear black and white. I don't remember whether the--which was black and which was white, the coat or the pants and what have you, but we decided that we wear black and white. So of course my mom got busy and I had a black and white, a formal gown that I wore. So the two of us you know were in our like colors, black and white and we went to the prom with that black and white and was looking very good I think.
Speaker 1: Was, was the prom held at the school?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.
Speaker 1: And graduation, tell me about graduation?
Speaker 2: Graduation was a lot of fun, it was, it was held--I think it was called the city auditorium [Atlanta Municipal Auditorium] at that time downtown in Atlanta [Georgia] there and that's where, well graduation was, and I don't remember how many it was in our class but it was a, it was beautiful and we enjoyed it (unclear). I remember the girls wore long, white eyelet, eyelet dresses, and I guess the guys wore black and white. I'm sure what was what, but it was, it was nice.
Speaker 1: Did you address the class at graduation because I mean you graduated with honors didn't you?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Did you graduate with honors?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did with honors but no, I was not valedictorian or salutatorian. Just had the honors.
Speaker 1: You didn't have a opportunity to address the class?
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 640538
Speaker 1: So the summer before you go off to college [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], did you have a job?
Speaker 2: No job (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or have you ever had a job up until this point?
Speaker 2: Never had a job well up until this point.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right now, I understand that you were a model at one time?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did some modeling.
Speaker 1: Tell, tell me about that?
Speaker 2: It was, well our church [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia]--first of all our church always had wonderful programs and stuff, and we would always have fashion shows there and whenever we had those fashion shows I would always model there. And I remember several other occasions when--like I think it was a grocery store in the black neighborhood at that time, they would have fashion shows so that--they thought that it would help to enhance their business and stuff and so they would have fashion shows and other types of entertainment and they would always call me to, you know to model that so I would that and then different other church related, church related events they would, other churches would call me to model as a--be their guest model. So it was just a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: What about the circulars that were put up in the stores? Were there circulars that were used along with white models? Do you remember anything about that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't remember, I just remember like--'cause this particular store down there that would give several fashion shows or just, just like you'd have the sale signs in the windows for you know food and stuff, then they would advertise that way and then they would use my name you know to be--that I'd be a model in there (laughter).
Speaker 1: Tell me about shopping during that time and, and where people shopped, black people?
Speaker 2: You know except for you know our neighborhoods, the stores and what would have you like in our neighborhoods, I, I don't really, really know what stores were pretty much there you know for the shopping, because as I said being sheltered all my life pretty much, I never really had to do like anything that--probably want for anything like that because (laughter) it was all done for me so I really don't know.
Speaker 1: Well most black people shopped on Auburn Avenue is that right? Is that where (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I would think so.
Speaker 1: Did you ever have an experience of shopping at Rich's [Rich's Department Store, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, Rich's, let's see the only thing that I had was not pleasant at Rich's, because having an account there at, at Rich's, an account, and I wanted to--after my shopping experience I would always go and have lunch you know in one of the cafeterias or whatever there, and I do just remember only like on occasion I felt a little sting of segregation because they would have like, it wouldn't really be like a curtain you know that, that divides you, you know from the whites from the black but they were like as I remember then like it would be like days, like they say Monday, Wednesday and Friday may be blacks and Tuesday, Thursdays and Saturdays some like, like whites--were never together that's what I'm saying. It was and that's the only time I felt the sting of segregation and when I got that then I quit. I didn't go back any more.
Speaker 1: Well, have you or anybody that you know, I guess, because you said you didn't do a lot of shopping, but were blacks allowed to try on clothing in these clothing stores?
Speaker 2: I'm told that, by me not having participated in it myself, I'm told that, that, that you would not use the same fitting rooms, (unclear). You would, you would have a different one for blacks, and a different one you know like for whites. You would never go in the same--that's what I'm told, but having not experienced that, that I don't really know but I'm told you had separate.
Story_ID: 640539
Speaker 1: Tell me about your experience entering Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: That was wonderful, I went--as I said I only went one year and I was excited because I'll never--you know looking forward to going to college and you went through all of the orientation and the whole program and it was, it was a good ex- a different experience because I remember, you know of choosing you know your classes and, and you know deciding, start thinking about what you want to do with your life and vocation and so it was--it's just that one year it was just, it was just interesting. I really enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: Do you remember who the president was at that time?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure but I think Ms. Manley [sic. Florence M. Read], I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, and this was--you enter in--you graduate from high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Atlanta, Georgia] and enter into Spelman in 1949?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that year you, you--what did you study? What was your intentions?
Speaker 2: My intentions (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I know you said you, you said in- interior design.
Speaker 2: I wanted to be a French major and that was, I think I held that as the most interesting thing, I--the most interesting class for me because I really wanted to get into French because at that time I had said I was gonna make French my major and the rest of it was just pretty much basically I went through it but I really put all my efforts in--interest in French.
Speaker 1: And, and what did you plan to do with the French?
Speaker 2: At that time I, I could just see myself, you know, being a, you know a French teacher you know. That's what I really went for at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so you're there for one year. Are there any teachers that you remember, any professors that you--that really stand out?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. I remember one is because I had a problem, I never will forget it. I think her name was Ms. DeWolfe [ph.] and I think--that was history I think you know, and I had a problem in that, at examination time, I never will forget it. I remember like the blue book I think that they had there and it was a, it was just a two part question and I think 50 percent was, was based on a certain number of facts and 50 other percent was based on you know another set of events and what have you, but the way, way I got myself in trouble was, is that when you answered the, the 50 percent of this one and then the second part was that if you know, if you--let me see how that went. Like if you did not know the answers to the fifty part, the other second part well you know explain why you know you didn't and why you didn't do well and me being a little flip you know was that I, I wrote, I remember writing, "No, I do not know the answers to that," so I think that cost me to get a D minus or maybe an F in you know in history because of my flip answers. See I answered the, the fifty parts that I really knew though and the other one that when they left it, you know, if you don't know why, can you explain why you didn't? And I just simply wrote, "No, I do not" (laughter).
Story_ID: 640540
Speaker 1: So what happens after the first year? Why, why don't you go back?
Speaker 2: Well I was going--I was looking forward to you know going in and finishing my education at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] because I wanted to protect, I wanted to take care of my mom [Bessie Barber Bailey], you know because she was getting up in age then and I wanted to finish my education, but what happened I met the love of my life, which was the Reverend A.D. Williams King [Alfred Daniel Williams King] at a very early age and like, maybe we were like twelve and thirteen, or thirteen and fourteen, early like that, and I met him at, at a YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] party or YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] whichever, and we met there and we sort of like just had a little friendly relationship from, from then up until we were married like in 1950, and during that, that time of our relationship, and what happened then was that we really became like serious in our relationship and I was--I had to leave college and because we'd, we were going to, we were going to have a child [Alveda King Beal] and, and so when I found that out I went to my father-in-law, at that time Reverend King was at, at Ebenezer Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia], and so when we told him that, that we had--my husband and I had gotten serious about our relationship and then I became pregnant with my first child and so I went to him and I told him I said, I said, "Reverend King," I said, I said, "I need to have an abortion," I said, "because I cannot have a child," I said, "because I got to finish my education, so that I can take care of my mom you know because she's been so good to take care of many." And so he said, "No, that won't happen," he said, "because the Lord showed me this child three years before she was conceived." And he said, "And so you and, and my son will have to get married so that I can this, this grandchild that the Lord has showed me to. So you all will have to get married." So we did end up getting married in June 17th, 1950 and I did not return to Spelman you know because I was married and at that time you had to live on campus at, at the end of the, the fourth year you had to live on campus and then you couldn't be there if you were married, so, so that ended Spelman at that time because of the pregnancy and marriage.
Speaker 1: Okay, now I want you to just go back a little bit because I know there's more to this love story with you and A.D.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So talk more about your courtship and, and actually how you met him? You met him when you were twelve or thirteen, but when did you really start dating and--tell me more about this, this--I know there's a love story there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it's, it's just so many things that I can tell you, you know about that, you know that--I think of one or two. As I said having met him at an early age, twelve or thirteen and all that. We were just doing, just little simple--going to the movies and stopping to have somewhere to eat that we could eat and he--I can remember he gave me my first sweet sixteen birthday party with his parents' [Alberta Williams King and Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] permission. That was exciting, going, going through that.
Speaker 1: Where was the party held?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Where was the party held?
Speaker 2: Where was it?
Speaker 1: Yes, your sweet sixteen birthday party.
Speaker 2: It was held in his home with his parents' permission, and I just can't remember anything that we did or did not do together. We were like inseparable, I mean whether it was movies or something to eat or just what have you. So that was exciting the sweet sixteen party. That was my first party that I had--anybody gave to me. I can remember sometime this was like when we would go to, we would go to some of the night spots, like there--where they would have parties and things. So he was always there and we were always like a couple because we were like serious then, so I just can't think of anything that we were--did not do, we were just inseparable.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so you got married at Ebenezer?
Speaker 2: No, I married in my home on 435 McDaniel Street.
Speaker 1: And who officiated the wedding?
Speaker 2: Who was there?
Speaker 1: Who, who married you?
Speaker 2: Dr. Watson, P.O. Watson [Peter Otis Watson] married us, my brother-in-law, Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was there, their sister, [HistoryMaker] Christine King Farris, was there and of course the parents, my mom and Ms. Vera Greer [ph.] and then my girlfriend, Catherine Keith [ph.], so it was just a little small qui- quiet ceremony.
Story_ID: 640541
Speaker 1: Talk to me more about, about A.D. Williams [Alfred Daniel Williams King] and, and who he was? We know he's the younger brother of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], but what does--tell me what A.D. stands for?
Speaker 2: A stands for Alfred, D is for Daniel, Williams was the family's last--I mean Williams was his [maternal] grandparents [Jennie Celeste Williams and Adam Daniel Williams], Williams and then King of course, you know his parents [Alberta Williams King and Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.]. And we called him A.D. for short, you know, a nickname, nickname was A.D. He was, he had a beautiful bass voice you know, he, he could sing too. He was very popular in, in high school and college. 'Cause he finished Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], so he was very popular. He was--at that time he was--they had a, an elite club while he was in college called--I think it was seven club members, that it was like seven of the top choice families, their sons and what have you he as in, you know that type of club. As I said a popular singer and then after, after the time after we were married and he was called to be a preacher, a minister. He was just great, he just, he just had this type of personality that, that just draws people to them and he had a great love for children, he loved people period, but a particular love for children. So he went all out for children. So--you'll really have time to ask me some questions because there was just so much about the man that I just, I just can't tell it all (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay so tell me about the, the first year of marriage and, and your first child?
Speaker 2: Okay, the first year of marriage was, was wonderful because being the first of Reverend Martin King, Martin Luther King, Sr.'s three children, we're being the first to be married of the, of the three children so I got all of the attention again, smothered by love, wrapped up in, in love. I never wanted for anything, everything was always provided for me and when, when our first child was born it was a girl, and we were talking about names, my husband and I were talking about names and so we had this book and I, and I said, "We gotta have a name for this, for this, for our child." So he said, "Okay." So I choose the name Veda, V-E-D-A, Veda. And I said, "How do you like Veda?" He said "I don't care what you name her as long as you put Al in the front of it."	So we named her Alveda [Alveda King Beal].
Story_ID: 640542
Speaker 1: So, tell me once again your--the name that you choose for your daughter.
Speaker 2: We choose the name Alveda [Alveda King Beal], Veda was the name taken from a baby book and my husband said he didn't care what she was named as long as we put Al in front of it because his name was Alfred [Alfred Daniel Williams King], and so when he said that I said, "Good," so I said, "we'll call her Alveda." So that's how she got her first name and her middle name is Celeste and that was named after her grandmother [sic. paternal great-grandmother, Jennie Celeste Williams], Alveda Celeste King.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you stay in Atlanta [Georgia] when she was born?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was staying in Atlanta (unclear) then and she was born.
Speaker 1: Where, where did you live after you got married?
Speaker 2: We, we moved several places after we first got married. We went into live in a home, one of the member's home, which was just not too far from our church [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] and then we moved from there to, to live with my in-laws [Alberta Williams King and Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] at that time at 193 Boulevard, so we lived with them for a while, and that's our two, three moves that I remember.
Speaker 1: And A.D. was called to preach when?
Speaker 2: Let's see, let's see his first calling in his first church was, I think that was 1958, it's '58 [1958] or '59 [1959].
Speaker 1: So from the time, from 1950 until that time tell me what, what did he do and were you a homemaker or--tell me what happened?
Speaker 2: He had several jobs before then, and I was a home- naturally a homemaker myself and I remember he worked at a rug company and then he worked for an insurance company and then he got--received the call to preach in '58 [1958] or '59 [1959].
Speaker 1: What year did he graduate from Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: It was later into our marriage. I don't remember the exact date now, but I can tell you something funny about that. He was a very good student and psychology was his major and he was excellent in that, and when it was time for him to graduate with, with his class he did not because he could not spell. He had done well in everything, all the other courses and he could not spell, so I think they finally got a little tired of him you know not being able to spell so they called him in the office. Said, "Mr. King," said, "pick out fifty words that you can spell and when you spell those fifty words," he said, "then you will have earned your degree," but he wouldn't, he wouldn't march with his class and I can't think of the year right now but he did get his degree and after he choose the fifty words, and after he--you know the fifty words that he could spell then he had his degree.
Story_ID: 640543
Speaker 1: Tell me, what was your relationship like with your father-in-law?
Speaker 2: Wonderful, I--he gave me the greatest compliment as far as I'm concerned for anybody that--having not known my own father, I remember while we were living in his--in Daddy King's [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] home one occasion, we were just having one of our many conversations and so I called him Reverend King and he said, "Wait a minute." He had a way he would point his finger. He said, "Wait a minute baby, let me tell you something." He said, "You call me dad," he said, "because I will be better to you than your own father would have ever been." And so that was, to me was one of the greatest compliments that I could receive, and so he became from then on Dad and his wife, Mother, 'cause I had my own mom [Bessie Barber Bailey] and then well I call her Mother. So from that point on I, I was accepted as a daughter, never as a daughter-in-law, always as a daughter. So it was just a wonderful--from the day, that day until the day he died.
Speaker 1: And did you have a special relationship with Mrs. King [Alberta Williams King]?
Speaker 2: Yes indeed, I enjoyed a special relationship with her inasmuch as Daddy King had Alveda [Alveda King Beal], which was his high hopes you know for this first grandchild, so Mama King, when my second child was born, who was a, who was a boy she took up to Alfred [Alfred King II]. So Daddy King had Alveda, and Mama King had Alfred. So they each, you know, had a grandchild you know to themselves and so naturally having that then I became endeared to her and it was not a day, not a day that, that she was in town whatever, that we did not talk or we did not go somewhere together, go together you know and all just because it's just special, and the Lord would have it which was, is always an imprint on my heart and will always forever be, the Lord would have it that when she was assassinated June 30th, 1974, when she was assassinated, I remember that Sunday very well in that my daughter [Esther Darlene King], who's deceased now, had just driven up to church [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] for worship, which was about 11:15 in the morning, and I remember driving up to the corner of the church and I remember my daughter jumping out of the car and I remember that I had to have it--someone park my car because I didn't know what was going on because it was so quiet and nobody was screaming, nothing was happening. So my daughter got herself lost someplace, somewhere and then I got out and I came through the basement up through the basement of the church up the stairs to the sanctuary, and when I got to the sanctuary I remember standing right in front of the communion table and there was a minister in, in the pulpit named Reverend Calvin Morris [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Calvin Morris] and he was saying something like the perpetrator [Marcus Chenault] had been caught, and this and that and I didn't understand what was happening because everybody, everything was so quiet and there was nobody in the church and no family member and I'm just looking around and looking around and I look to my, to my right and I saw the lady who had been shot in the neck, Ms. Jenny Mitchell [sic. Jimmie Mitchell], was sitting and I said, "What is going on?" And by that time I saw a stretcher come down the aisle and as he came down the aisle I walked over close so I could see what was going on, and as I got to that point I saw two men lower the organ, pull it back and then I got closer so that I could see what was going on. So when I got close and I could see what was going on, that was my mother-in-law who was, who was shot and had slumped over the keys at the organ and I was in such disbelief I could not believe my eyes. So at that point I remember the attendants lifted her up from the seat where she had slumped over, put her on the stretcher, started up the aisle and there was nobody around at that time but me by myself. I just went right behind, went right behind the stretcher, right out to the street to the ambulance, the driver got in, I was in the center, attendant on the, on the other and I had my eyes veered right on, back to her looking at her and I'm still in a state of disbelief, I could not believe it, and, and I remember putting her fa- her hand up to her face and, and moaning just a little bit and then we got to the hospital and then I lost it.
Story_ID: 640544
Speaker 1: So how long were you at the hospital before they actually told you that she was gone?
Speaker 2: That didn't happen because I remember when they put her--they took her to the room where they were working on her and I slipped inside the door and they didn't see me and I saw them doing their work, you know punching on her chest and what have you and then they recognized it, so they told me that I had to leave. I said, "But I can't leave." I said, "It's nobody here, but me and the rest of the family members are not here and I'm the only one here." They said, "I'm sorry, you can't stay." So I remember going out of the room and going down the hall and when I looked down to the hall, I saw Marcus Wayne Chenault [Marcus Chenault], the shooter, but I didn't know who he was at that time. I just saw him in the center and an officer on either side and that his eyes were just bulging like they were gonna fall out of his socket or something, and then I thought I would go back again so I turned around and came back in the room and looked, slipped back in the room again where they were still working on her and I'm assuming she was still alive and they working, and so they put me out a second time. They said that, "If you don't stay out this time we're gonna have to have you arrested." So I went on out for that time and by that time I walked out and I saw the rest of the family members coming in, Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.], her daughter [HistoryMaker Christine King Farris], her husband [Isaac Newton Farris, Sr.] and one or two others and at that point I lost it and I don't remember anything else, and so far as I remember she was still alive when I left. I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: I see. What reason was Chenault there? Was he injured?
Speaker 2: Was he injured? I don't think so. I remember an article in the Jet magazine where he had--I think it was ten members I think that he called on his hit list. He wanted to get--Daddy King, really who he really wanted, but he didn't get Daddy King so he got Mama King [King's mother-in-law, Alberta Williams King] so that's all I can tell you.
Speaker 1: And the reason why he was at the hospital, do you know why he was at the hospital?
Speaker 2: Well I'm thinking, I don't know when he, as I remember, as I recall when he had done the shooting it was my son and maybe one or two other deacons or somebody that got him, caught up with him and--as he was trying to exit down the stairs to go to the parking lot, and I think that he was either pushed or fell or knocked by the--my son and the two other people what were--got him and fell you know down the stairs so I had--I guess that they were bringing him for you know surgery, I mean some--for some service you know because if he was injured in that fall or whatever, if he was, I said I don't know if he was injured then I guess he was there because I left and I don't know what happened from there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there was another woman who was shot?
Speaker 2: Yes, that was Ms. Jenny Mitchell [sic. Jimmie Mitchell] who--
Speaker 1: And then there was some--a deacon who was killed (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And a deacon was killed, Edward Boykin was killed, and Jenny Mitchell was shot in the neck. She was still sitting down--attendant--when I saw her, but I left, when I left she was still sitting there 'cause I was going with her.
Speaker 1: All right, okay so talk to me about the climate of, of Ebenezer [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] and, and the community after this happened in, in the family?
Speaker 2: Well, of course there was such an outpouring of love and, and sadness at the same time because here you had Mama King who had been there for years, and years and years and her love for music and all and so that just went on for, for you know for a long time you know that, that outpouring of love and sympathy for her.
Speaker 1: Tell me about her, her role as you watched her you know, her role in the church and you know as the first lady and I understand she was the choir director.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me what about her and, and how you felt about her presence in the church?
Speaker 2: She was, well in my words, that's what I'm saying, she was Mama King of Ebenezer. There's no way to say it no better than that, into every organization and certainly the music was at the top of it you know, she was just, she was just amazing you know, knew almost every, every member by name and, and could, could have at her command just anything that she touched, just, it's just, there's just no duplication, there's no duplicate of her, just, just wonderful (laughter).
Story_ID: 640545
Speaker 1: Well, let--let's go back 'cause we, we jumped to 1974 with that story and we're really still in the '50s [1950s] going into the '60s [1960s], and you talked about two of your children, but let's go back and talk about the rest of your children. Tell me their names, when they were born.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And even today, you know where they are and what they do?
Speaker 2: Okay, well I, I said Alveda [Alveda King Beal] was first born, Alfred [Alfred King II] was the second born and he's deceased now, he died in 1986. Derek [Derek Barber King, Sr.], my third born is alive and well. He lives in Indiana. Darlene--Esther Darlene [Esther Darlene King] was my fourth child, she's deceased as of--let's see she was born in fifty- '76 [1976], so she's deceased now and Vernon Christopher [Vernon King], my last child deceased, and he died last year, May 1st of last year.
Speaker 1: So a lot of your children died very young?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean and were these accidents or were they sick or is there?
Speaker 2: The first two, Alfred and Darlene, to my knowledge I didn't even know it myself, they died in jogging related--died--Alfred was jogging around a field and Darlene was jogging around the high school field where she went to high school, and they both collapsed there. Vernon had, has had several bouts with sicknesses and heart thing, and I think and the Lord just called him home 'cause he was tired.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your son, Derek, he's--you said he's in Indiana, what does he do?
Speaker 2: He teaches at one of the colleges there [Martin University, Indianapolis, Indiana], I never know the name right now.
Speaker 1: Okay, and Alveda, she lives in Atlanta [Georgia] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She lives here in Atlanta. Very busy. She is in almost everything that's happening, she's a part of (laughter).
Story_ID: 640546
Speaker 1: So we talked about A.D. [King's husband, Alfred Daniel Williams King], had a couple of jobs until he was called to preach and, and tell me about that transition into--to preaching?
Speaker 2: It was interesting, now as I said he was very well liked and accepted because he was just wonderful in spirit and in actions and deed and the job went well at the, the carpet place where he worked and then it went well with, I think it was insurance, that it went well with that, and it was that, during that second job that he received a call to pastor.
Speaker 1: And so where did he--of course his father [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] was the pastor at Ebenezer [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia], so is that where he began his, his, his call to preach?
Speaker 2: No, no he had, he pastored three churches and co-pastored the fourth. The first church was at Newnan, Georgia, Mount Vernon First Baptist [Mount Vernon First Baptist Church]. The second one was First Baptist Church of Ensley [First Baptist Church, Ensley] in Birmingham, Alabama, the third was Zion in Louisville, Kentucky and then when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], his brother, was assassinated he was called back to co-pastor Ebenezer.
Speaker 1: Okay so you said that very fast.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But let's, let's walk through each one of these because you had to make a move too, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the first church was you said was Newnan?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So that's not far from Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And I understand that their family had some ties down in Newnan anyway, right? So tell me about what happened when he started to pastor at Newnan?
Speaker 2: Did his first church and an opportunity for me to be the first lady of all of the four churches was, was interesting and he grew, he grew in the spirit of the Lord very fast, and was very successful and the congregation grew and I learned to, how to fit in you know as a, as a first lady and, and I did my best to support him as his help, meet--and it was a real experience with the people in Newnan and when he--the only reason why he left is because he was called to pastor the second church, which was the First Baptist Church of Ensley in Birmingham, Alabama and the same was there, he was a wonderful pastor, had many programs. The people loved him and he loved them and again to me a rich experience to be the first lady for the second church. I learned and, and a lot of experiences and learned how to, to help him in, in his ministry there and I never took a lead role in, in anything. I always--except for music, I stayed with my music, I loved my music. I stayed with music, but I always kept myself free and, and available for him when he needed help with in his wounds and trials and what have you as a, as that and then the only reason why he left Birmingham, Alabama is because he was called to Zion Baptist Church in Louisville, Kentucky and again it was the same experience. He was just wonderful and had great spiritual leadership there and the church just grew and grew and again for me another experience on another level because this was the biggest church of the, of the four of the--I would say the biggest of the four at that time for me to be there and, and share with him as first lady and of course the only reason why he left Zion was when his brother, Dr. King, was assassinated and his father, they called him back to Atlanta to co-pastor.
Speaker 1: Okay, now the first congregation, how many members do you think there were in Newnan?
Speaker 2: It was small, but I can't give you a number. I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Now in, in Alabama how long did you stay in Alabama? Did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We went there from--in 1961 and we went to Zion in '65 [1965].
Story_ID: 640547
Speaker 1: Okay, now civil rights is really picking up and, and Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] is involved and tell me about your, your husband's [Alfred Daniel Williams King] support of his brother during the Civil Rights Movement, some of the things that he might have been involved with? Tell me more about the time during the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: During the Civil Rights Movement, 100 percent my husband was there to support his brother in, in any, in any issue that was being--going, carrying on that they at that time. When he was in Birmingham [Alabama] he took the lead in, in the Birmingham movement because his, he and his brother were together on that. So he took the lead in the Birmingham movement of the civil rights bill [Civil Rights Act of 1964] and whatever the issues was he was right there on the forefront out on those issues. His name was never out there much. You didn't hear that much because you only heard his brother's name though, but that did not take away the actions and--that my husband was there because in every, in every move he took the lead in the Birmingham experience and the same for Louisville [Kentucky] when he, when we went to Louisville. Let's see, our home was bombed in, in Birmingham as a result of his activities in segregation. When we moved to Zion [Zion Baptist Church] in Louisville, the church was bombed you know because of his activities because he never stepped back. He never took no, he was just always there in the forefront because he knew he had his brother's back and he needed him to come in, his brother's work to come in there, but he never needed his brother because he always handled all of it himself, but he never got the recognition, and that was, much to his credit, Birmingham and Kentucky was due to my husband's dynamic leadership.
Story_ID: 640548
Speaker 1: Now talk to me a little bit about the incident of your house being bombed in, in Birmingham [Alabama], 'cause they were calling it Bombingham at that time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Bombingham, right, right.
Speaker 1: So let's first talk about the bombing at your home when it was in--and what happened? Give me the, the details of that incident?
Speaker 2: Okay, the--it was May the 11th, 1963, a Saturday before Mother's Day and I had set my dining room table with all of my finery on it because the next day was Mother's Day and so I wanted to have everything you know pretty and ready to go for Mother's Day. So it was exactly eleven o'clock, May the 11th, 1963, a Saturday night. My husband [Alfred Daniel Williams King] was in the bedroom working on his sermon. The children were all in bed and after I had finished setting the table and all I decided that I would just sit in my living room and just pray and reflect and just enjoy the peace and quiet of, of the evening. So I was sitting there just you know praying and reflecting when my husband got up and came to the front of, the front--opened the front door. No, he came up the hall and he said, he said, "It's too quiet in here." He said, "Let's, let's just get out of here." So I remember while I was sitting there the picture window began to crack but I didn't hear anything, I didn't see anything and I was just sitting there and at that time that's when he said, he said, "It's too quiet in here. Let's get out here." And opened the front door and he said, "Let's just get out of here," he said, "it's too quiet in here." So he came over and took me by my hand and by the time we got up from the sofa and headed down our hallway, our house was like an L, by the time we got like down by the hallway, the first--the cracking of the, of the windowpane was the first bomb that was hit and I'm told that it was tossed, that's what I'm told. It was tossed and then the second bomb was the one that brought all of the front of the house--oh, I'm sorry--we'll get this?
Speaker 1: Let's stop for a second. Okay.
Speaker 2: The second bomb was the one that brought the front of the house down so that is when the house was bombed and the time.
Speaker 1: And your children were in the house as well?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you just got everybody out?
Speaker 2: What happened, when that happened then we got everybody up and we went out the back, out the back door because the front was all blown out and was gone and we went out.
Speaker 1: And so, did you, where did you go to stay until--did you fix that house or did you move from that house (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The house was eventually fixed and we stayed in it because the front was damaged you know, but we could stay in the back of it so it was, it was fixed.
Speaker 1: And did they ever find out who was responsible for this?
Speaker 2: Yes, there was a witness and his name was Roosevelt Tatum, I think that was his name I'm not sure, I'm told that he saw an officer toss something. There was a police car across the street. I'm told that Roosevelt saw that officer toss something and so I'm assuming that must've been the, the first bomb that was tossed over you know into, into the hedges of that and he supposedly went and, and got in a ditch you know 'cause he was afraid you know for his life and so he went and got in a ditch and it was the second bomb that was, that brought the front of the house down, so that's what I'm told.
Story_ID: 640549
Speaker 1: I believe that the bombing was a result of a march that your husband [Alfred Daniel Williams King] had lead earlier that week?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You wanna tell me about that? Do you remember what the march was about? Or where it was (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't really remember for the simple reason that my husband had a, a rule and a way, that he had said from the very beginning that, that he would be the one that would be out there, would take on you know all of the drama, the issues and whatever and what have you, and we had five beautiful children and that I should be the one to stay at home and take care of, of the children and then be there for him when he, you know needed my support or what have you. So I did not keep up with all of the details, and, and I don't want to say something that I don't really remember, so that, that's about it.
Speaker 1: Okay that's fine, but he, he did lead--
Speaker 2: Absolutely (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) a, a demonstration.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And they, and they--we can say that, that was one of the causes for the bombing to your house?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay that' fine.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Now the 16th Street Baptist Church [Birmingham, Alabama], you might not remember, but were some of the, the people who were hurt during that time, people that you knew?
Speaker 2: I did not know the four little girls you know that--but that--but I do, I do remember keeping up with the news and keeping up with them there after that with the four, you know the four precious little girls that, that were killed. I did not know any of them like personally.
Speaker 1: Did your husband know Fred Shuttlesworth [HistoryMaker Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth]?
Speaker 2: I'm sure he did, yes he did.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did you ever meet him?
Speaker 2: I met him several times (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Times.
Speaker 2: I didn't see--I didn't attend the mass meetings and you know all those things for the reason that he--and I just told you that I had to stay home and all so I never got to interact you know with, with the, with them because he was always the one out there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so anything else that you can think about in Birmingham [Alabama] in--during the time that he pastored in Birmingham [at First Baptist Church, Ensley] that you might want to talk about?
Speaker 2: The only thing that you know, that I would, that I would add you know that--I would just like for it to be known or, or you know that my husband was a civil rights giant, and you know and he did not stand in the shadows of his brother [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] or anybody. He held it all on his own to the best of his ability and I was just--want, you know, everyone to know that and to appreciate the fact that he was that and that he did hold you know his own and you know and on, on every, on every level he held his own level and if they would just remember him for his daring works you know, and, and as being an unsung hero.
Speaker 1: So you leave Birmingham and go to Kentucky?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you're in Kentucky until he's called again and, and that's you said that was the biggest church [Zion Baptist Church, Louisville, Kentucky], the largest membership I should say (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 640550
Speaker 1: Before we go--talk about the assassination, Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and Coretta [Coretta Scott King] get married in--like three years after you.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, tell me about your meeting Coretta and were you at their wedding?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, I always liked Coretta from the instant that, you know that we first met and I don't remember the circumstances of what, but I liked her from you know from the very start and then of course having to share with her in music you know because she, you know she was a concert singer herself and so that kind of like you know gave us like, you know like a bond together right there. And then her--Yolanda [Yolanda King] her first born, she was born first, and, and Yolanda and I were born on the same date, November 17th and so that you know added to our bond you know to hear of that. So she was just, has always been so special to me and more like a sister you know that, that I never had because we just had this close relationship and I can't think of anything as far as the family is concerned or whatever that she was not there and took a lead role in it so, she was just wonderful and all you know, in any way you could think of and yes, I attended her wedding when she got married in Marion, Alabama. I was there and it was just a lovely, little, simple ceremony but very pretty and from that point on she, we just kind of like became endeared to each other from then on. I don't know anything that, that she did or had anything to do that I was not included. I even traveled with her from time for a--I was her traveling companion when she went from place to place, you know to speeches and demonstrations whatever. I traveled with her for about four or five years. So I just can't think of anything that--where she was involved but I was not included and a part of.
Speaker 1: Now she was your sister-in-law and Christine King [HistoryMaker Christine King Farris] was your, also your sister-in-law. Did you have a relationship with her?
Speaker 2: With?
Speaker 1: With Christine?
Speaker 2: Not, not too much because she was like in education and my father-in-law [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.]--I'm saying this, this is my way of saying it. He had his way of protecting Christine and his wife [Alberta Williams King] like, like my husband [Alfred Daniel Williams King] does. He was the one that was the fighter that was out there and kept his ladies you know preserved, and so having you know said that, we never like--very seldom interacted together see, because she was like in education, and here I was out there with the civil rights and all these other things, preacher's wife what have you, and so we really never got to bond like Coretta and I had a chance to bond. And then of course when we were moved from place to place you know we sort of like lost that so, but I love her dearly.
Speaker 1: But you had a, a more special relationship with Coretta also because you were both--well, would become first ladies and move around with your, your families as well (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: But all the things that were going on in the Civil Rights Movement, did she ever--did you ever share, because you were first in this position as first lady and having to, to deal with a husband who was in the forefront, did you share information with her or give her advice on different things that you had gone through or experienced that would be able to help her?
Speaker 2: Very--having moved from place to place and we'd only like get together like on special occasions or dinners or Christmas or Thanksgiving, we never really hardly had much time you know to spend like, like quiet time. So, it's more like quality time with her than, than quantity time. It's more like quality time with her because she you know was then in her own rights, you know taken off into the different walks that had called upon her and so I very seldom had much time as I said to spend much quantity time with her. It's mostly quality time but in the times that we did had, we did touch and then share.
Story_ID: 640551
Speaker 1: Now I know that your husband [Alfred Daniel Williams King] was involved in a lot of the different marches and demonstrations that Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was involved in as well even though we very seldom hear his name.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: But do you remember some of the events that he also was a part of with Martin, as far as marches?
Speaker 2: In all of the marches he was, he was involved with Martin because they would communicate you know and strategize and plan all that. So, I don't, I dare say there's not a single one that he was not involved with that he and Martin didn't get together and talk and strategize.
Speaker 1: So Martin is in Memphis [Tennessee] and how do you hear that he's been assassinated?
Speaker 2: How did I hear it?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: This was in Kentucky, it was I think it was a Wednesday night [sic. Thursday], I may that wrong, but I had the news on and my husband was already in Memphis. He had already gone, my husband was already there so I was in Kentucky, just the children and I, and I had the news on and that's how I heard it over the news.
Speaker 1: Did your husband call you--
Speaker 2: No, we--
Speaker 1: --to let you know that he was okay after the dust settled a little bit?
Speaker 2: No, we did not talk until after the fact.
Speaker 1: That--I mean after the assassination (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) After the assassination, we didn't talk--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --until after that--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --because he was there and we didn't talk until after the fact.
Speaker 1: Did he talk to you about where he was when it all happened?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Was he, because he, he--we don't see him in any of the pictures or maybe I just don't know that it's him--
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: --in the pictures, but I mean he, he definitely--we know he was definitely there, but did he talk to you about where he was when it happened? Did he give you any details about that?
Speaker 2: No, as I said earlier he never--let me see how to say that, he never discussed any church related programs or what have you, he never discussed that with me. He never discussed, during the civil rights, his activities actually--that he never discussed any of that because this is what he said without a shadow of a doubt as I said earlier, he wanted to keep all of that, and he did keep all that to himself and he didn't bring in and share it, he said because when he came home to the children and to me, he had wanted all of that to be away from his time that he spent with us because he was gone a lot, and he wanted to spend that time with us and so he never discussed those issues and things with me, that he kept that separate from his private life with me and the children.
Speaker 1: I understand. ML and family, their house was also bombed after the fact. Were you able to share with Coretta [Coretta Scott King] by telephone anything or talk to her during those times and maybe try to comfort her or give her some, some hope?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we would, we would talk by telephone on, on anything that, that was happening like you know from the time he was like stabbed in New York City [New York, New York] and the different protests or whatever was going on, we would talk, but as I said before, so much of her was taken, she had to take so--after his assassination she had to, she felt, she had to be out there and to be the frontrunner and take up where he left off so there really wasn't much time you know for me, you know what I'm saying. I don't know about anybody else or anything, wasn't much time that we didn't, we didn't get together and talk because she was just like almost gone so much that you just never saw her. You would hear about her on TV but you just never saw her.
Speaker 1: What about the SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference]? Was your husband a part of that when, when Martin was elected president?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was out there active right along--as I said with anything that was going on, he was a part of it and, and, and did his part in whatever it was that Martin had for him to do, he was, he was there. He was a board member, and he was right there by him, with him.
Speaker 1: And that's some of the things that people don't know that he actually was a board member of the SCLC (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Story_ID: 640552
Speaker 1: So now, Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] is assassinated and your husband, A.D. [Alfred Daniel Williams King], is asked to come back to Atlanta [Georgia] and co-pastor. How do you feel about this move back to Atlanta?
Speaker 2: I was ready you know, I was ready for you know, for the move because whatever God had in store for him or whatever his calling was that he had to do, he, I let him know right off that, that I would support him 100 percent and I was right there with him to support him, so when he came back to Atlanta I was very much ready and was very much supportive.
Speaker 1: Where did you all live when you first came back to Atlanta?
Speaker 2: When we first came back to Atlanta, we--he bought a house on 812 Braemar Avenue, Southwest Atlanta and that's where we lived.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how old are your children getting to be now, 'cause this, this is--1968 is the year that you--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --that you moved back to Atlanta?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you all moved back right away?
Speaker 2: Right, right away.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so your kids are, are growing up and are they showing any signs of, of becoming preachers at that time?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Any of your sons taking after your husband?
Speaker 2: Yes, I am blessed with you know two, two ministers. Derek [Derek Barber King, Sr.] is a minister, he's in, in Indiana and Vernon [Vernon King] was a very successful pastor and, and Alveda [Alveda King Beal] is--she calls herself an ordained evangelist, so I'm blessed you know, so we got three.
Speaker 1: Is your family, all of your family that's here in Atlanta, are they still members of Ebenezer [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: There's nobody here in Atlanta now. Alveda belongs to another church and, and Vernon of course was--I mean and Derek, you know when he moved and left here he was a member before he left, Derek, but he's in Indiana now, and of course the other three are gone. The other three are passed.
Speaker 1: So tell me about your husband becoming the co-pastor under his father [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Interesting, now they--to my knowledge they had no, you know no problems and the church had no, no problems with you know calling him back as co-pastor and in the short time that he was there from '68 [1968] through '69 [1969]--July of '69 [1969] he had brought many, many programs during that time and the church was growing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What were some of the--
Speaker 2: And accepted him you know as, as a son come back home, as a pastor.
Speaker 1: What were some of the, if you can remember, some of the programs that he brought?
Speaker 2: Okay, the first thing that I remember right off, he started the television program at Channel 5 [WAGA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia], which was aired you know weekly and under no charge. They carried it for--I don't, twenty, twenty-five more years what have you. That was one ministry. He, as I told you he loved children and passionately, and so he started the children's, the children's chapel [A.D. Williams King Chapel for Children]. He had a bit of--and, and plans on he had started to do some, some construction on the church, you know as far as, at that time the old church as we call it, the old church. He was going to do some renovations on that, that had been approved. That's just three of them that I can think of right off the bat.
Story_ID: 640553
Speaker 1: We kind of jumped ahead and, and missed a, a few things. So just go back so that you can just reflect on these things, but in, in '63 [1963] while you were still in Birmingham [Alabama], President Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was assassinated. What, what are your thought about that? What were your thoughts about President Kennedy being assassinated?
Speaker 2: I really was--as I said was just really, was just really, just shocked beyond words because the first thing that came into my mind was that you know, why is it that all of the--what I call good men, you know with good hearts and principles and all, and when they give their all or put it right out on the line you know, they're taken, you know taken from us you know and just simply you know for doing good, for doing what's right, what was just and all and then to have him wiped out, just taken from that it just left me completely heartbroken.
Speaker 1: And then the, the Civil Rights Act [Civil Rights Act of 1964] and, and Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] you know was very in- involved in getting that. Was your husband [Alfred Daniel Williams King] also--I mean of course he was supportive, but was he there right alongside Martin when that was being dealt with?
Speaker 2: You mean when that was signed?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Of--I'm not sure, I don't remember.
Story_ID: 640554
Speaker 1: We know that the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] was always following Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], do you think that your husband too was being watched by the FBI?
Speaker 2: Definitely I do, I think that because not only was Martin and, and my husband, but all of the civil rights groups, I think that they were on their tail, and they were targeted and they were being watched, every move that they, they made. Yes, I do.
Speaker 1: Was there anything that you can think of that would really say this is that--you know in your mind--what--do you think your phones were being tapped or do you have anything you know in your inner self that really made you believe that?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, I, I can remember an occasion in Birmingham [Alabama], which led me to believe you know that it was the system that killed all of the martyrs, and that was--my husband was, was at home 'cause he had gout and he was, he was out of, you know out of service there for a while because of the gout and I remember on one occasion a sheriff came and knocked on the door, and I went to answer it. So when I went to answer it, it was the sheriff and so he said--there was never no names or none of that--, "I got a warrant here for A.D. King [Alfred Daniel Williams King]." I said, "I'm sorry you can't, you can't serve him no warrant," I said, "because he's in with the gout and so he can't come--you can't come in." "Yes I can, yes I can come in. I'm gonna serve this warrant." So he just brushed aside, pushed the door open, brushed aside and when he stepped in and--when he stepped inside the door I said, I said, "You're in my house now," I said, "take your hat off." I said, "You're in my house, you're in the house." "No, I don't take my hat off nowhere," he said, "I'm going to do--I ain't taking--." So I didn't say no more, I just looked at him. He just made his way all the way down through there 'cause he knew the house and knew (unclear), he just made his way all the way down to the bedroom and I guess he served him the warrant 'cause I stayed right--you know I didn't go back there with him, I stayed. So when he got ready to come back out I said, "I wanna ask you something," I said, I said, he said, "What is it?" I said, "Are my phones tapped?" He said, "Let me tell you something." He said, "You see that car sitting right out there?" I said, "Yes I do." He said, "All I have to do is just sit there and hook up to them wires right there on the telegram pole and see--I mean and hear everything that's going on. Yes, your wires are tapped."
Speaker 1: Now that--you were not surprised at that were you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was not surprised.
Speaker 1: Now there were two other major campaigns, one in Selma [Alabama] and then the, the march from Selma to Montgomery [Selma to Montgomery March], were--was your husband or were you involved in?
Speaker 2: He was always involved but I was not because I again (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, right.
Speaker 2: --my role was to stay back with the children--he was involved.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember seeing anything about Bloody Sunday on the news? Were you concerned when you saw it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh I just, I mean naturally you know I just almost went you know, almost went--lost my mind almost because I just you know knew how they were--people were putting their lives on the line and how they were being beaten you know and jailed and what have you and my heart just, just went out to each one of 'em individually.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I have been back several times since my husband's death, now of course because I'm a member of SCLC/WOMEN [SCLC/Women's Organizational Movement for Equality Now, Inc.] and we take a tour every year. So ever year I've been, I've been a member since about three or four years, and every year we go on a heritage tour and we do some leg of the Civil Rights Movement each time we go. So I've been able to walk over the, the bridge [Edmund Pettus Bridge, Selma, Alabama] you know and, and relive and reenact some of those, those, those scenes.

Speaker 1: Now, we know that the nonviolence philosophy was Martin Luther King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] thing, but how did your brother [sic.]--was he, I guess all the--did he buy into it all the way? I mean some people bought into it somewhat, some people bought into it all the way. Was he all the way in with nonviolence?
Speaker 2: I would think so, I can give you two--I'll tell you two stories that, that led me to believe that he bought in it and he lived just what he said, he lived it. I can remember in 1955 when I went to--let's see, to see him and Coretta [Coretta Scott King] because Yolanda [Yolanda King] was their first child and, and, and it was born. This was Montgomery [Alabama] and I went you know to, to see my--'cause she was born on my birthday like I told you, so I wanted to see my niece. So we went and I don't know what day it was but it was a night about eleven o'clock. I don't know what day it was and I was sitting in the darkened living room in there and Coretta was busy back with Yolanda, busy and all and Martin came in, and so when he came in--I told you my nickname is Nene and that's all he ever called me was Nene. I don't care where we were whether--he'd call me Nene. So when, and so he said, "Hi Nene [HistoryMaker Naomi King]." I said, "Hey, ML," so he walked over to his mantel and it was dark in there, all you saw was just the light from the street, you know from--through the window. And I'm sitting there and I glad he couldn't see my face you know. So he walked over to the mantel and he put his hands up on the, the mantel and he said, "You know what Nene?" I said, "What?" He said, and he put his hands up to his throat where his tie was and he said, "You know what Nene?" I said, "What?" He said, "You know what?" He said, and he was fingering, he said, "You know what they tried to choke me to death with my tie. They tried to choke me to death with my tie." So I was just quiet and didn't say anything, and he said--he just kept you know fingering with his tie and he said, "But you know what Nene," he said, "the more they do to me, the more I'm gonna love them 'cause that's what I'm supposed to do. God said that I'm supposed (unclear)." I just couldn't stand it, I just, I just, I just couldn't stand it. I'm glad he couldn't see my face 'cause it brought tears to my eyes. So that was one instance that, that I knew that he was like committed. The other time was when he was in New York [New York] after the stabbing, and I would call him and we would talk you know during the day just to see how he's doing and all that, and so when I talked to him on one occasion I said, I said, "Martin is there anything I can do for you?" He said, "Yeah." I said, "What is it?" I told you my mother [Bessie Barber Bailey] taught me how to cook and, and I didn't like to cook but I did it 'cause I had to. And he said, "Make me a sweet potato pie." I said, "Okay," I said, "I'll find out." I said--he called his wife Corrie, he said, "Find out when Corrie's going to take the flight up in here and if you can make me a sweet potato pie." And I said, "Okay, I'll do that." And so I went straight in, fixed the sweet--find out when she was gonna be leaving, made the sweet potato pie, put it in a plastic container and took it over there for her to take it to, you know to him. So make a long story short when I talked to him, I said, "You got your pie?" He said, "Yeah, Nene I got my pie." He said, "It's delicious as always." And I said, "Well, I'm so glad Martin." And he said, "Nene?" I said, "Yeah ML?" He said, "You know what?" I said, "What?" He said, "If I had sneezed I would've been dead." I just, I almost dropped the phone (makes sound), I couldn't stand it. So when he says if he had sneezed he would've been dead, and when I finally got to myself, I cam- I said, "Martin, ML," I said, "thank god you did not sneeze." I had to hang up the phone.
Story_ID: 640556
Speaker 1: Now Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was committed, you just told us that. Was A.D. [Alfred Daniel Williams King] as committed to nonviolence as your husband--as ML?
Speaker 2: I think so. As I said having not discussed you know things with him like--I had to find out just like most people did through the newspapers or through the TV or what have you, but his commitment to the causes of whatever they were as to how he laid his life, his body on the line you know for that says to me that he was just as dedicated or more so.
Speaker 1: Okay so now we are at the point where we've, we've already talked about ML's assassination, and now your husband is back at Ebenezer [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] and we talked about the programs. So what happens next now that you're here? This is 1968, and your husband is putting together all these programs at Ebenezer, what happens next in your, your lives?
Speaker 2: Well, I can only speak for me you know as to, as to me. After his tragic unexpected death, you know I, I knew that I had our five children to raise and to see them up on their own and out on their own. So from his death on up until the last one left my home you know I, I devoted my life to raising them, working in The King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia] and after the last one left, after the last one left then I just decided that it was up to me now to move on.
Speaker 1: Okay we talked about ML's death but we did not talk about A.D.'s death, so I want you to go back and tell me about what happened. Where were you? And how did he, how did he die?
Speaker 2: We had--let me see Coretta [Coretta Scott King], Bernice [HistoryMaker Bernice Albertine King] and Dexter [Dexter King] were her two children. For me it was Darlene [Esther Darlene King] and Vernon [Vernon King] that, that our two we, and we went on a vacation to Jamaica, this was, what is it '69 [1969], went to Jamaica and we were there for two weeks so the Thursday or the Friday, I'm not sure which it was, my husband had to leave to come back to Atlanta [Georgia] for the pulpit, to be in the pulpit for that coming Sunday and he left Jamaica and came on back to Atlanta, and Coretta and her children and my children we left on a Monday to come back to Atlanta. And while we were packing on that Monday morning, getting ready to come back, Coretta got a call and--saying that my husband had drowned in, in our home swimming pool and when she told me that news I couldn't believe it. I couldn't accept it because he was a good swimmer you see, and I, I just couldn't accept that. So I didn't say anymore. We went on and we, we packed and we left, and as soon as we landed I said, "I've got to go straight to the funeral home," and said, "see for myself." I said, "'Cause I don't believe this because," I said, "my husband was too good a swimmer and I just don't believe it." So with that when we got off the plane I went straight to the funeral home, and when I got to the funeral home I told 'em I had to go in and spend some time, I had to see him for myself. That was my husband, to see about and spend some time for myself. So I did, I went into the--they didn't want to do it but because he was not dressed what have you and I got adamant. I said, "You have to make an exception," I said, "I have to go see him, like whatever he's like I got to go see him. I'm sorry I just got to go see him." So I went on into the, into the room where they had him and when I went to, to see him and looked at him I couldn't really, couldn't believe it. So I pulled the sheet back and, and when I looked at him he had a, a bruise on his forehead and his throat was very dark and then when I looked at him and when I thought about it I said the system killed him, you know I said the system killed him. And that's about all I remember that--because I think I lost it after that because I had to accept the fact that he was dead you know and then, the fact that there was a bruise on his forehead and his neck was very dark and like--it seemed to me--I said the system killed him and then I lost it; I don't remember anything after that.
Speaker 1: So the time after that when you had opportunity, I mean that was foremost in your mind that you know, that he was killed by the system and do you believe that Martin and A.D.'s deaths were related in some way as far as them being leaders? Well, we know Martin, but A.D. as well might have been killed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure.
Speaker 1: --because of that?
Speaker 2: I believe that and all of the others, that I call martyrs, that are gone now because of their commitment to civil rights and causes and you know and that (unclear). I believe all of 'em; honestly, I do.
Story_ID: 640557
Speaker 1: Now at this time, now Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had been dead a year, and did Coretta [Coretta Scott King] found the center for nonviolent change at that time, the Martin Luther King center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia]? Was--had that been started yet or founded?
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: The King Center?
Speaker 2: She started the, the center just after, soon after Martin's death.
Speaker 1: So you were involved in that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, always.
Speaker 1: Okay so, so talk to me about starting that and, and who were some of the, the players involved and why she felt that this was something that needed to be done?
Speaker 2: Well certainly my husband was a--you know had a part you know in that and as much as you know making plans and there were you know a host of 'em. I don't remember you know all of 'em's names whatever, but he had, you know he had a part of that into that and when that got started it wasn't long after that, that I became employed at The King Center in, in the gift shop that, that I was--managed for about twenty-two, twenty-three years.
Speaker 1: Now, okay, so we're saying that A.D. [Alfred Daniel Williams King] actually had a part in starting The King Center, he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) With her, yes he did.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right and the other question is--sorry to jump around but just to go back to your husband's death, how did they find your husband? How did they know he had, had drowned?
Speaker 2: How did they--who found him? I think as I remember correctly my son, it was either Der- I think it was Derek [Derek Barber King, Sr.] that maybe found him and, and in our home swimming pool, Derek was and then he alerted the rest of his sister and brothers.
Speaker 1: Oh I see, okay, all right okay. Now we talked about The King Center, its inception and you beginning to work there and this is the first job that you have taken in all these years right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In all that years.
Speaker 1: Because you were raising--
Speaker 2: After raising my children it was my first job.
Speaker 1: Well, let me ask you, did you ever go back to school 'cause you had that one year at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia]. Did you ever go back to school?
Speaker 2: I made three attempts to go back to, go back to school and each time I, I would go back, when it was time for the medical examination, I mean you know medical at the school you had to be, had to have your tests and whatever at the school. Each time, three times I was pregnant, how about that (laughter)? So I lost three chances to go back to finish, and so after the third attempt my husband told me he said, "I tell you what," he said, "just, just give it up for a while," he said, because he said, "I can take care of you and the five children, so just don't worry about it anymore." Said, "I'll take care of it," so, and naturally he was killed and didn't get to, I didn't get to go back anymore.
Story_ID: 640558
Speaker 1: All right so working and, and your children getting up there where they'll all start to leave home and go to college and then in 1984 that's when ML Sr. [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] passes away (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: Talk to me about that and how you felt because this is your dad now.
Speaker 2: You know when he passed, to my knowledge, this was the second time I think he had heart, he had a problem with heart failure and I was at work when they called and told me. They said, said, "You need to come on down to the hospital because dad has just passed," and so that hit me like a ton of bricks (unclear). I said I don't believe this you know, so I dropped everything I was doing and went on down to the hospital, and when I got to the hospital I don't think I saw no family members I don't think, but my sister-in-law, Mrs. Farris [HistoryMaker Christine King Farris], and so when I walked in and I, I still couldn't believe it I said--no, no that, that--it was after I saw a doctor that came in, he came in and he walked in and so I asked the doctor, I said, "Doctor, may I see my father-in-law?" And he looked at me for a minute. He said, "Sure you can see him, we'll bring him down and let you see him." And I said, "Well, thank you very much." So within minutes they brought him down, you know I guess from where he passed, I guess they brought him down to one of the rooms or what have you. So that's the kind of person I am. I mean I, I can hold up until I really realize that they're gone and then I kind of like you know lose it. So you know when they brought him down and I walked into the room by myself, I was by myself, I walked in and, and looked at him for a long time. I don't know how long I stood there but I do remember kissing him on his forehead and he was still warm, he hadn't gotten cold yet, he was still warm and I kissed him on his forehead and then I took his hand and I said, "Well Dad," you know I told you he told me to call him dad, I said, "Well Dad," I said, "old soldiers don't die, they just fade away." And I guess I lost it then after that because I realized he was really gone and that was it, that's all I remember and then that was it and I was gone.
Story_ID: 640559
Speaker 1: Now besides working at The King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia] you, you said that now Coretta [Coretta Scott King] is taking a lead and now she's out and about and still making sure that the work of the--of all of those who were in the forefront at that time, because she, she was kind of like a stay at home mom with her kids 'cause you never saw any of her children marching. You know your kids always being protected, but we saw her a little more on some of the marches with, with Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], at Martin's side, so people really knew who she was so she kind of took that lead role and to continue his work and you, you talked a little bit or you just told us that you were her companion on some of these trips for a couple of years.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I want you to give us, give me a little more detail about some of the places that you went with her and now you have a little more time to, to talk and reflect so talk to me about that?
Speaker 2: Well during that time she, Coretta had--was you know was sought after and about all over the country you know whether it was speeches or marches or whatever was meant to be, and she had to have a, a traveling you know companion with her so it was my time to go and be, be that one with her this time, and so I only have maybe have just like a, a few pictures you know that we took together because you know she would always be leading some union march or civil rights march or just doing something and I'd always be there you know with her when she would do that and it was then during those marches and what have you that we would have quality time that we would spend together but not quantity time. So we did exchange experiences and, and learn a little bit more about each other and you know and bond us a little more than we already were.
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of the places that you traveled to with her?
Speaker 2: I, we--I took--I kept a log which is, which is on file but I just remember I mean that we went all over you know, New York, California, just, you just pretty much name it, we went to wherever her schedule needed her--visit her, her physical (unclear) I was with her, but that's a log in The King Center.
Speaker 1: So you did that for about five or six years (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) About five or six years.
Speaker 1: And then you continued to still work at the gift shop?
Speaker 2: I retired in 1995.
Speaker 1: So tell me what, what you have been doing since that time?
Speaker 2: Since 1995 I, I became extremely active as a senior citizen. I go to three different centers and engage in whatever they have, you know the activities I scheduled and that's what I've been doing from 1995 up until my injury in March of March 14th of this year.
Speaker 1: What, what happened?
Speaker 2: March the 14th of this year I was--I go to--we have two services at Ebenezer [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] and I usually, I always go to the early one because I like putting Christ first in my life and I go at eight o'clock and I was just leaving, walking down the aisle getting ready to go to my car and leave and there were stones on, on the floor of the church and they have little cracks, I mean little lines and you know and so I was just, wasn't looking I guess, I was just walking like I normally do and my shoe heel got caught on one of those lines on the stones of, of the church and there was nothing to hold on to, there was nobody around at that time, 'cause everybody had--we had just left each other and we were going our separate ways and there was nobody around. The next thing I knew my shoe heel got caught and, and threw me forward like that on this and broke this shoulder.
Speaker 1: So are you in therapy now?
Speaker 2: I'm in therapy now three times a week and I had a wonderful workout this morning.
Speaker 1: Well I'm sorry to hear that. I didn't want that to be part of what you've been doing.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 640560
Speaker 1: In 2005, Coretta [Coretta Scott King] suffers a, a stroke. Well, first she finds out she has cancer.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And this wasn't well known, but was this something that you knew, and that could, you could keep her lifted in prayer about?
Speaker 2: Well we, we, we I'm, I'm being very honest, I didn't know the stages, but I knew what was and so that just kept, kept me prayerful just all during the day you know for her, and I'd go to see her as often as I needed to go and see her until she started making visits to these out of state, you know to the different hospitals or what have you to get treatment or whatever and when she was at this last place. I can't think of the name of where it was then. That was when I really realized how serious you know it was and that anything you know could really, could really happen you know to her and I just, just almost just went--where I prayed almost hourly for her because I was just so broken you know about her and her lovely spirit.
Speaker 1: And, and then with the stroke it seemed--the cancer was progressing but the stroke really just added insult to injury.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Did you, were you able to see her before she passed away?
Speaker 2: No because she was--I can't think of where she was at that time but I do remember it was Dexter's [Scott King's son, Dexter King] birthday, January the 30th, 2006 was when she, you know when she passed and I didn't see her anymore because the last time I saw her was in her apartment, you know here in Atlanta [Georgia] before she took that, took that trip.
Speaker 1: Trip, okay--were you close to or had a--did you have a relationship with her children, her three?
Speaker 2: Yes, we were always close, and I tried to do as she did. She remembered everybody's birthday. I don't think there's a soul that she did not remember you know and so I have tried to keep that going and to stay in contact with them since her passing.
Story_ID: 640561
Speaker 1: What is it that you have not done that you would like to do?
Speaker 2: That I have not done that I'd like? I think I told you earlier that if I had finished college I would have, I would have become an interior decorator and so I really--I'm not worried about a degree you know in it or nothing like now, but I still like dabbling in interior decorating and I would like to continue that in some, some way or another and, and because of my love for music in all its form when I turn eighty if I--if the Lord let me live to be eighty years old I'm gonna start taking piano lessons and learn to play for my own pleasure.
Speaker 1: Well I, I see some of your decorating ideas and I see that you love butterflies. What started your, your love of and collection of butterflies?
Speaker 2: That's easy, my daughter [Alveda King Beal] carried me to Callaway Gardens [Callaway Resort and Gardens, Pine Mountain, Georgia] years ago and when we went on the tour I remember going into the butterfly room where the, you know where the butterflies live and thrive what have you and while I was standing there and just looking in awe at all of 'em and I think the monarch is the--to my knowledge the most beautiful one, I was just standing there looking and I remember I put my finger out like that and when I put my finger out a monarch lit on this finger, I won't forget it. He lit--one lit, another one lit on my shoulder, another lit in my hair and that did it for me, and I said, "From now on," I said, "I gotta have a butterfly." So that started my love for butterflies and it has continued.
Speaker 1: Okay when you look back over your life is there anything that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: The only thing that as I look back over it that I would do differently is that I would have finished college, whatever it take, I mean (unclear), I should've gone back and, and finished college although I tried three times to go back and do it because I know education is key in anything you know and I would, I would go back and finish, and finish college. Other than that it's okay.
Story_ID: 640562
Speaker 1: Is there anything that we have not talked about that you would like to talk about? Can you think of anything?
Speaker 2: The only thing now that gives me real concern is that I said I love children and young people and every time I, I look at the news or pick up a book or read or some stuff and I look at the children of, of today and I know time changes and everything changes, nothing remains the same, I do know that, but it just breaks my heart in that, where I see young people, male and female, where I think something is lost in this, in this generation in that when I see young girls--because God made everything that's beautiful and graceful in its time, and when I look at young girls, some of 'em today and when I look at the way they expose themselves and then the disease, you know drugs and disease and, and somewhere something has gone wrong you know with, with, with--we as parents or what have you, is going on and that they have missed out on so much that we worked hard and we were trained (unclear). It seems like that is not present in as I look at the generation of male and female today. There's something is lost there and we need to go back and capture that because God made everything good, everything beautiful and that's the way it should be and whenever it's to the contrary it just saddens me when I look at it so I would love to see that change.
Story_ID: 640563
Speaker 1: So because this is going to be available for many future generations, if you had to send a message to the future generations, what would it be? What do you want to tell them?
Speaker 2: In the words of the Master when he said, "Seek ye first the kingdom," you know, "of God and all of his goodness, his riches and his glory and all these things will be added to you" [Matthew 6:33]. Somewhere that in a sense, in my mind has been lost because they are seeking after worldly pleasures whatever and you can't have that but so much, but so far you know and if you leave God out of it, out of the midst of it you'll miss out, you know, completely. So we need to go back and put Christ into their lives above everything else and seek his goodness, his glory, his riches and all these other things will be added unto you.
Story_ID: 640564
Speaker 1: What do you want people to say about you or what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: As I told my daughter [Alveda King Beal], and we've all been through so much, we've done so much and we've you know given our all into whatever was going on and I would say to her, I said, "If there's one thing that you can do for me, if you live longer than I do, is that whatever the issues, whatever is going on just say for me, 'Lord I tried.'"
Story_ID: 640565
Speaker 1: Before we, before we close out I know that you work with the foundation, the A.D. Foundation [A.D. King Foundation, Atlanta, Georgia]. Tell me the whole name of the foundation and what the foundation does?
Speaker 2: The foundation to me, I give first all glory and honor to the Lord, Jesus Christ and to Dr. Babs Onabanjo whose brain child it is of the foundation in that, is that he has done, or is doing what I'd like to see and have said and done for the rest of his work--at that time is that my husband [Alfred Daniel Williams King], an unsung hero gave his life, his best, his all and being an unsung hero I wish to thank Dr. Babs Onabanjo to carry on in his honor.
Speaker 1: And, and he's also making a documentary about your husband as well is that not right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, and do you know the name of the documentary?
Speaker 2: (BABS ONABANJO): 'Behold the Dream: Brother to the Dreamer.'
Speaker 1: 'Behold the Dream: Brother to the Dreamer.'
Speaker 2: And that's coming out very soon in 2010?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And I understand that there was a parade, was there a A.D. King parade [A.D. King Youth Empowerment Parade]?
Speaker 1: Very successful.
Speaker 2: Where was it?
Speaker 1: When?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (BABS ONABANJO): It was April 24.
Speaker 2: April 24th of this year.
Speaker 1: Okay, and was there a specific reason why it was done during that week?
Speaker 2: (BABS ONABANJO): Yes, that was (unclear) and the youth, it was focused on youth development.
Speaker 1: And--I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: (BABS ONABANJO): And the focus was on mentoring.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what he's saying is that the focus was on mentoring and youth. That's what, what it was about.
Story_ID: 640566
Speaker 1: --That the focus of the parade [A.D. King Youth Empowerment Parade] was centered around youth because your husband [Alfred Daniel Williams King] was concerned about the children just as you are, as you just got finished talking about your concern about the children, and you also go to schools don't you to do some speaking to the kids?
Speaker 2: Not now.
Speaker 1: But you did?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: And some of the things that you told them with--just what you got finished talking about right?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: All right, well we'll be looking for the documentary ['Behold the Dream: Brother to the Dreamer'] because I understand that the first and second screening were very successful.
Speaker 2: Very successful.
Speaker 1: Okay, and if that's all that you would like to talk about, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to, to share your story and your husband's story so that the generations to come will understand and, and understand the, the integration of, of the King family, so that your husband is no longer an unsung hero.
Speaker 2: Thank you so much, the pleasure was mine in having--so we'll be looking forward to giving more thanks as the documentary unfolds. Thank you so much.
