Speaker 1: And I just am going to ask a few questions.  You know, just--they're real short.  Like, I'd like to know what your favorite word or phrase?  There're no--any, you know, specific answers.
Speaker 2: What my favorite word or phrase? Profit (laughs).
Speaker 1: Well they say--that's what it says in all the articles you're a number cruncher (laughs). I need to have you run some numbers for me.
Speaker 2: I like profit.
Speaker 1: Okay that's good. Okay.  Your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Late spring.
Speaker 1: Your favorite food?
Speaker 2: That's a good question. I'm partial to pastas. But--I think probably seafood fettuccine pasta is one of my favorite foods.
Speaker 1: Okay. Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: Okay. Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Now that changes all the time. I would have to say Florida.
Speaker 1: And what about favorite sport?
Speaker 2: Golf.
Speaker 1: That's what I thought.  Well, you know my father actually teaches golf.
Speaker 2: Does he?
Speaker 1: But I don't play. Anyway.
Speaker 2: What a pity.
Speaker 1: I know, I know.  I keep I keep saying I'm going to try but it's hard--I don't know.  That's all he ever did.
Speaker 2: It's, it's the most difficult game I've ever played.
Speaker 1: Right.  See that's what my, you know my  concern is. You played you played basketball in high school.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously)  Right.
Story_ID: 9064
Speaker 1: I want to start with your childhood. And just, you know, like to know--have you share with us some childhood memories.  You know, you're the oldest of four--.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --Kids.  And you know, how was it growing up?  And you know what was--you know, if you--you know, share--just any of your childhood memories.
Speaker 2: Okay. First of all I grew up here in Chicago [Illinois], and when I think back to my childhood in many ways it was, you know, that of a normal kid.  Played a lot of baseball and had a lot of friends in the neighborhood.  One of the things that I began to realize that was different about my house than maybe other houses is that my dad [George Johnson] traveled a lot.  And he, you know, at one point in my childhood I thought we were, you know, really different or wealthy because we'd get a new car every year.  What I didn't realize at the time was that those cars probably had a hundred and fifty thousand miles on them, because at that time my dad was starting to build Johnson Products Company.  And the best form of transportation was a station wagon that he could load up with product and go to Detroit [Michigan], Cleveland [Ohio], Kansas City [Missouri], Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and sell what was then our first product, Ultrawave.  And that was really my breeding ground, if you will, that developed an interest in business. And Johnson Products Company through the years obviously has been a legendary institution in the black community.  But I recall being, oh probably five years old, and sitting down at the kitchen table one night.  And my dad was, you know, clearly disturbed about some things in the business. I told him, "God, I wish I had five thousand dollars to give to you, you know, to take care of all these problems."  And he looked at me and he said, "Son, five thousand dollars won't do it."  And I thought five thousand dollars was like all the money in the world.  And you know it, it, really put an indelible impression in my mind.  And then the strange words that I heard around the table like 'bill of lading,' 'accounts payable,' 'accounts receivable.'  I mean that was almost like code language, and I couldn't wait to find out what those terms really meant.  Even though I'd asked the question at that age, really didn't have an understanding.  But, it clearly made an impression on my life.
Story_ID: 9065
Speaker 1: How old were you when your father [George Johnson] started Johnson Products [Company]? Were you--I mean were you, were you born yet?  Or was--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes, I was three years old when Johnson Products was started.
Speaker 1: And what was the inspiration?  How did he even get started? And what you know, what was that sort of all about?  How did--.
Speaker 2: Well, my dad had been a chemist--first he had done several jobs.  But at one point in his career, he worked for a company called Fuller Products Company, that was run by Mr. S.B. Fuller [cosmetics company owner/entrepreneur].  And Mr. Fuller was a clear, mentor, role model, someone who had done some legendary things in the black business community and built an organization that was essentially a national organization of door to door salespeople.  When my dad got started, he began first in sales but then looked at some opportunities to go into the lab.  And in the process of being in the lab, he developed a product that was a homogenized hair straightener, and he had some friends who were barbers who discussed with him some of the difficulties they were having at that time with hair straightening products.  And the primary motivation, if you will, was the fact that these products were not consistent. They weren't reliable in terms of application time.  One product wouldn't straighten, the next one would over-straighten, one would burn, the next one wouldn't get the job done.  So they were looking for how could someone develop a consistent product that could be used with  some dependability.  And through a association that my dad had with a German chemist, they developed the formula for Ultrawave [hair product].  And he actually went to Mr. Fuller and talked to him about developing the product and Mr. Fuller didn't have any interest in it at that time.  And that was really the motivation that created you know, a platform for George Johnson to go out and become his own entrepreneur.
Speaker 1: Now where was--tell me a little bit about your father and where he--was he--He wasn't from Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No he was born in Richton, Mississippi.  Came to Chicago at the age of three.
Speaker 1: And what--so he--was your mother involved in the business at the time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so can you just describe--I mean what you what you've been told about the start 'cause you were three years old.  I mean you know that he decided, he decided to sort of take--go on a lark and go out on his own or--?
Speaker 2: Well when the business first started,  the real challenge was how do you make the product? How do you sell the product? And how do you kind of build up the name all at one time?  So the manufacturing part of the business took place generally from about three o'clock in the afternoon until late hours of the night.  And the daytime hours were spent developing sales.  And when my dad came up with the idea, he knew that he needed $250 to start the business. And he went to a bank to borrow the $250 and the bank told him, "Mr. Johnson. You have very good credit, you have a good job, and if we loan you this $250 to go into business you will undoubtedly lose your job and won't be able to pay us back."  So he left out of there really dejected and after probably a good night's sleep thought about it and went to another branch of the same bank and told them that he needed $250 to take his family on a vacation to California, and he had the $250 in about an hour.
Story_ID: 9066
Speaker 1: He [George Johnson] started this business [Johnson Products Company] and you were three at the time?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay. And so you grew up in a household basically where like you were saying before, business was always being talked about, you know, and--and at that point and time was your mother at home sort of raising you?  Was--?
Speaker 2: My mother [Joan Henderson Johnson] was involved in the business.  She was the--I would call her the administrative head of the company.  She was responsible for--once they got to be large enough to have a bookkeeper other than herself--monitoring the activities of the bookkeeping, and the sales and the billing and the invoicing et cetera.  She was not involved in manufacturing or sales, so kind of all of the office administration part of the business was her responsibility.  Prior to that, she had worked in the criminal courts, as a clerk in the criminal courts.  And one of my other early memories was I went to work with her one day and she had one of the guards give me a tour.  And we went down and I saw where the jail cells were.  And he wanted to know if I wanted to get inside and I told him, "Absolutely not."  In fact, I think I screamed to get out of there (laughs).  But she was involved in the business and clearly a support.  And the interesting thing about those times, because we're talking about the mid '50s [1950s] and the '60s [1960s], wherever my dad traveled, in many of the major cities you couldn't stay in hotels.  Because this is pre civil rights freedoms.  And so, he wound up staying in a lot of either black-owned hotels in cities that had them, or literally in people's homes. And at the same time, there were another group of people that were traveling likewise and these were a lot of the black musicians.  So I can remember being at home and meeting people like Louis Armstrong [jazz musician] and Louis Jordan [perfomer, jazz musician] and, you know, many of the--Ray Charles [composer, soul musician]--many of the people that were really active at that time in the music business.  Because he knew them because they were all staying in the same few places where blacks could stay.  And so it was really a very interesting childhood. Probably why to this day I still like jazz.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: Okay, do you want to start?
Speaker 1: I was just saying were there--you know, did you have a sense, you know, other than the fact that your father got a car every year of you know, of, you know, of being really different from other people?
Speaker 2: Well, there were, you know, in school for example. There were not a lot of kids whose parents, obviously, owned their own businesses.  And in the early years of the company, you know, you could say, "Well, my dad does this."  But no one really knew it because the products were not that well known.  And so it was not so much that I felt special or different , but in the things that I saw within the household, it seemed different than the experience that other people were having in their households.
Story_ID: 9067
Speaker 1: I think, if I were to describe my father [George Johnson], the first thing I would say is that he is a deeply spiritual person.  If he's had one major rule in his business it's been, what he would openly tell you, is the Golden Rule.  Beyond that, I would say that he is--he doesn't appear to be a risk taker.  He doesn't appear to be a person that would, you know, really put themselves out front as you meet him.  But as you watch his actions and the things that he's done, clearly that's an integral part of his personality.  So, if--when people meet my dad, the one thing they always come across as saying is, you know, what a wonderful man he is, you know. Because he's--he's gentle, kind of low key.  But at the same time, very assertive in the things that he believes.
Speaker 2: And where do you think he got his drive and ambition from?  You know--.
Speaker 1: From his mother.  There is no question about it.  My grandmother [Priscilla] raised three very strong men.  And my Uncle John worked in the business up until his death.  And he died of cancer now about twenty years ago.  But he was the vice president of sales.  And my other uncle, Robert Johnson, ran all of the transportation for Johnson Products [Company] until his retirement.  So the three brothers stayed together, were involved in the business together, and I would say probably no more than every other day got mentoring from my grandmother.  And if they didn't call to get it, she'd call them to give it. So it was an extremely close relationship.  As a result, I think all three of them, began working at an early age.  My dad would always tell me, you know, how he enjoyed his childhood because he always had money in his pocket.  And, you know, from the time he was eight, until the time he was seventy-two, when he kind of--actually maybe seventy-one, when he actually said, "Okay, I'm ready to retire," he told me, "You know, it's been since eight years old that I haven't had a full time job."  So those values clearly came from my grandmother.
Story_ID: 9068
Speaker 1: Your mother [Joan Henderson Johnson], what--what kind of person would you say she is?  And--and, you know, what influence did she have on you?
Speaker 2: My mother is a very aggressive person.  She is a very intelligent person.  She also is a firm believer in values.  And she is the kind of person that always wants to be supportive, but doesn't necessarily go along with everything you want to do.  So, my mother is--you know, she has a standard and you, you, have to kind of march within those lines.  And to that extent you get her support.  And otherwise she won't necessarily not support you, but she'll just watch.  And I think that's--that's been her real strength. Because we all have, all of my brothers and sisters, have a very close relationship with her.  And I think we all--I'm certain that we all have a lot of respect for her.  But she is a different person than my dad [George Johnson].  She's more the fire in that side of the relationship.
Story_ID: 9069
Speaker 1: You were the oldest.  Did you find--you know, a lot of times as the oldest, there's pressure to sort of perform or, you know, or just serve as a role model.  Did that occur in your family?
Speaker 2: I would not say that there was a pressure to perform by being the oldest. One thing I remember growing up is that my dad [George Johnson] always instilled in me that, you know, to succeed you have to be better than the others.  And I took that pretty literally. And even in my career in Johnson Products Company because I was the son of the founder and the president, if I got a promotion, my requirements for productivity were clearly different than anyone else in the organization so that I was held to a tougher standard to advance than let's say someone who came in from--that was disassociated with the family. That gave me a good not only training ground, but it also gave me a innate desire and motivation to achieve.
Speaker 1: Now, your--describe your--you know, your, your siblings also. Their names and you know--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Their names and ages.
Speaker 2: My brother John [Johnson], is two years younger than I am, and he works in this business.  And he has been a part of this company since I've acquired Richardson Foods from the Quaker Oats Company in December of '97 [1997].  Prior to that he had been with Johnson Products and just prior to coming here had been with a brokerage firm in Minneapolis [Minnesota].  So it was a good opportunity, kind of like in the family tradition to bring a brother back in.
Story_ID: 9070
Speaker 1: So you were talking about your brother John [Johnson].
Speaker 2: So John is involved in the sales organization and has approximately fifty percent of the country and is involved in our [Johnson Products Company, hair care product company] retail sales. My brother George [Johnson] Jr., is involved in construction.  And he has a company that both rehabs apartments and they've developed a number of new real estate projects, and currently is gearing up for a development that they're doing with six hundred acres in McHenry, Illinois.  My sister Joan has--well she graduated from Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois], in the MBA [Masters of Business Administration] program.  And worked in Johnson Products [Company] for a while and when the company was eventually sold, she stayed on for a short period after the sale of the business and then married a young man and moved to Argentina.  So most recently she is now relocating back to Chicago [Illinois] and has three children.  And is also going to be involved with my brother in the real estate development in McHenry, Illinois.
Speaker 1: So this--that's wonderful.  This whole entrepreneurial tradition continues strongly--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 9071
Speaker 1: Are there any other childhood memories around, you know, the holidays or anything, you know, that you would like to share?
Speaker 2: Well I have lots of childhood memories.  You know, growing up I think one of the things, in the summertime, you know, we just used to just play all day long.  And in those days, you know, television wasn't such an attraction, and you didn't have video games, and a lot of things that I watch my children do today. So we tended to be involved with kids from all over the community.  And, you know, you knew--especially as you started playing basketball, you would know people from everywhere.  And it seemed like in some ways we had a different motivation.  I watched my son today, you know, and he's interested in playing basketball but if it's too cool or whatever outside you know, then okay, we'll do something else.  And I constantly sound probably like my dad [George Johnson]. You know, "John," you know--and we literally did.  We used to literally shovel the snow off the basketball court, you know, so we could go out and play if it looked like it was going to get to be forty degrees that day.  But those were a lot of the memories, you know. The relationships that I developed as a kid, many of which are still with me today.  And as, you know, having continued to live in the Chicago [Illinois] area, you see these people that you grew up with, and they're also involved in their careers and now have their children, and it's very interesting--enjoyable.
Story_ID: 9072
Speaker 1: What area were you raised--was it Chatham [South Side Chicago, Illinois neighborhood]?
Speaker 2: Chatham.
Speaker 1: Chatham, okay, okay.  And what was--just describe that community.  You know, a lot of time--you know Chicago has sort of changed in some respects, but Chatham was a pretty tight knit community.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I really was involved in the whole genesis of Chatham.  We moved there in 1955.  And in 1955, probably half of Chatham--no probably 80 percent of Chatham was still white residents.  And we saw a whole generation, if you will, of blacks move into that area that were prominently focused on career development.  So people would be maybe a store manager or there were some people that owned their own business, you know.  Mahalia Jackson lived less than a block away.  And, you know, Jolyn Robichaux [entrepreneur] was in the area about two blocks away.  And you know, ironically, Jolyn is the person I acquired Baldwin Ice Cream from. So a lot of people that were involved in the Chicago Historical Business development and that became quote "the first managers" with various companies grew up and moved to Chatham.  Interestingly, that, you know, twenty years later, most of those people were still in those homes.  And you know, that's really what provided the stability for the Chatham area.  And even to this day I'm almost certain that I can walk through Chatham and knock on the doors and know 40 or 50 percent of the people that would answer the door, because those people continue to live in Chatham. The interesting thing about Chatham is homes never go--you never see a for sale sign.  You know, if a home becomes available, more than likely it's acquired by someone in the family or someone that the family knows.  And so from a real estate and community stability standpoint, I don't know that there are many communities anywhere as solid as the Chatham community.
Story_ID: 9073
Speaker 1: What type of child were you?  Were you serious?  Were you rambunctious?  Were you, you know, a dreamer?
Speaker 2: I would say that I was a normal kid.  You know, in other words, yes I was a dreamer and I dreamed about--I used to always tell my dad [George Johnson], "You know, one day I want to run a 'Fortune' [magazine] 500 company," once I realized what 'Fortune' 500 ['Fortune' magazine's annual list of America's top companies] companies were all about.  So that's kind of the dreamer side of me.  I was a kid that went out and played a lot of sports, so there's the athletic side, you know, and we would occasionally get into trouble and that's, you know, the typical kid.  And in school, I was a good student if I was interested and I was a marginal student if I wasn't.  And it really kind of depended on whether the teacher was motivating me or not.  So it varied throughout.  And it wasn't until I really got into late high school and college that I decided that, you know, one day these grades might count for something. So I raised the bar, and performed at a different level.  But prior to that school was a place that, was--a place for learning, but also very much of my life a place for both sports and social life.
Story_ID: 9074
Speaker 1: What elementary school did you go to?  Were you in lab [laboratory school, magnet school] the whole time?
Speaker 2: No. No, I went to lab only for high school [The University of Chicago Laboratory School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So I started off at Ruggles [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] and then went to a private school for about two years, which was St. George [School, Chicago, Illinois], which is the predecessor to Harvard St. George [School, Chicago, Illinois] at 48th [Street] and Ellis [Avenue]. Then I went to [Amelia] Hookway [Elementary] School [in Chatham], and I graduated from Dixon Elementary [School, Chicago, Illinois].  And then went to the University of Chicago Lab[oratory] School for high school.
Speaker 1: So how was the lab school experience?  You know, were you--in school, there was a certain group of black kids that were at lab school and went to school apparently?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: What was that experience like?  I mean, were these a lot of the kids you had grown up with or were they a new set of kids?
Speaker 2: They were a new set of kids.  In high school in that sense was a little bit different for me because I had a set of friends that I lived around and associated with on the weekends, and then I had a set of friends that I had in school.  And obviously, the distance between Chatham [South Side Chicago, Illinois neighborhood] and the University of Chicago [in the Hyde Park neighbohood] was such that these two communities didn't have a lot of overlap except for in the area of sports.  Because when you play basketball you--we would travel out to different locations and really played all over the city.  So the people that I played basketball with I'd meet them virtually anywhere.
Speaker 1: And--ask about school, okay.  But who, who were some of your friends, and the people that are still your friends today?
Speaker 2: From high school?  The high school group I don't see as much anymore.  There were--probably Prentiss [B.] Taylor [Jr.] is one of the few who is a doctor here in Chicago.  Bonnie Boswell [Hamilton]--I spend a lot more time with her mother, [Dr.] Arnita [Young Boswell], than I do with Bonnie, because Bonnie is now involved in television out in California.  So that, you know, a number of the--Judy Savage is a doctor and now I do see her occasionally here in the South suburbs.  But for the most part, careers have taken people either away from Chicago or they are, involved in areas that we--our paths simply don't cross.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You know I've often heard, and you don't have to comment on this. But I've often heard that, that the lab school was really sort of lethal for black boys. You know that it was a difficult place for, you know, young black men to go.  But--now--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, let me comment on that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I never--that's a surprising question, because I had a great experience at the lab school.  Now, it also could be because of the time that I went there.  In '64 [1964] to '68 [1968], you know, you went through a period that was just after the March on Washington [1963].  And civil rights was very prominent.  And of course, 1968 was everything from Dr. [Martin Luther] King's [Jr.] assassination through [U.S. Senator] Robert [F.] Kennedy, et cetera.  So there was a real serious attitude among students even at the high school level, some of which was carried down by events that took place at the college and at the university itself. But also things that were happening within the city of Chicago.  Because you know you're talking about '67 [1967] where the riots [major riots in American cities] and California [Los Angeles, California riots of 1965], so--we were what I would call pretty strong militant/activist students.  And kind of took it as a role to talk about these things.  We formed organizations, got involved with the administration of the school.  And so the kind of apathy that you see on a lot of campuses today, college or otherwise, I would say, really didn't exist when I was in high school, because it was a pretty serious time.
Story_ID: 9075
Speaker 1: And what was Chicago [Illinois] like around that time [1960s]?  You know was it--I mean you were a--you know, you were a young person at that time.  And, you know, friendships and things, you know, were important too. But what was--was, was there a lot of activity? Were your parents [George and Joan Henderson Johnson] involved?  I know they were still busy building a business [Johnson Products Company].  Were they involved in the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: Oh clearly.  My dad has been involved in the Civil Rights Movement, really since--well even prior to 1960.  But in 1960, I recall having a corporate meeting for Johnson Products Company that we not only invited about twenty-five of the freedom riders to that meeting, but that's the first time I ever met Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.]. And my dad and Dr. King had a long relationship.  I remember when [Rev.] Jesse Jackson first came to Chicago.  And my dad and Cirillo McSween [entrepreneur] and a number of other people decided to not only take Jesse under their wing, but they financed him going to theological school and were the major financial supporters of Operation PUSH [People United to Save Humanity] even when it was Operation Breadbasket. So the awareness of civil rights, the need for equality in our community and in our society have always been part of my life.
Story_ID: 9076
Speaker 1: I want to go back to this whole thing of who--your father [George Johnson] was clearly a player, you know, as you say, in the Civil Rights Movement, and I--and that--let me ask about that, because a lot of you know, sometimes businessmen--people tend to sort of toe the line or don't want to get themselves out there, you know, because it could be hazardous to their business.
Speaker 2: Well that's possibly true in some cases. The people that I am aware of, that I grew up around or listened to or saw in Chicago [Illinois] were not that type of person.  The people that I am aware of were extremely involved in civil rights, both financially and in terms of their presence and in terms of their participation. Because it was--it was critical to the long term success of all the businesses.  One of the reasons that George Johnson [Johnson's father] for example could play a strong role in that--and quite frankly, most black businessmen could play a strong role is because they got very little if any of their income from the white community.  So these businesses were based in the black community, most of their customers were black consumers, and if they were professionals in either legal or medical fields, their patients and/or clients were traditionally black people.  So there wasn't a reluctance of business and professional people to become a part of the Civil Rights Movement that I'm aware of.  And I think I know or have known most of the people that were involved in that process.
Speaker 1: So tell me about some of those people and who they were and, you know, what roles you think they played?
Speaker 2: Well, I would think that George Johnson, Cirillo McSween [entrepreneur], John [H.] Johnson [publisher], Al [Alvin] Boutte [banking executive], Jacoby Dickens [bank chairman], George Jones [entrepreneur], who owned Joe Louis Milk Company, Lester McKeever [accountant].  These are some of the top names that come to my mind, and I'm sure that I'm not remembering many others that were involved as well--Dempsey Travis [real estate entrepreneur]--and one of the advantages that many of them had, is that in their childhood they all grew up pretty much in the same area.  And these were, you know, whether it was John Johnson, George Johnson, Jacoby Dickens, even as you heard them talk it would be, "Well he was class of, you know, '47 [1947].  He was class of '49 [1949]."  And they've known each other for all of their lives. They also were probably some of the primary recipients of the extreme segregation that existed in Chicago historically.  And because these people were intelligent and capable, they also felt the barriers to their development.  And so I don't think there was any reluctance on their parts to become involved in the Civil Rights Movement. Their--Jewel LaFontant [MANkarious, attorney and federal appointee] and her husband Ernest LaFontant, at one point were extremely powerful. And people were involved both from again, business professions. But the support within the community was, by today's standards, unprecedented.  And one of the reasons is because it was truly what I would call, "In your face" type segregation, "In your face" type discrimination.  There wasn't a lot of doubt as to whether this was real issue or problem within our community.  And unfortunately today, we've lost some of that recognition, because the form of discrimination today is much more subtle.  It's at a higher playing field, but at the same time, it's just as divisive and it's just as destructive to the long-term development of our community.
Story_ID: 9077
Speaker 1: Why did Chicago [Illinois] create so many black--successful black entrepreneurs?  You know, it was a very segregated city, but a lot of places were segregated at that time.  And, you know, yet I would say of a lot of the, you know, major cities Chicago still stands out, you know, with the George [Johnson] and John [H. Johnson]s, you know, and the people that you mentioned.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I'm wondering if you have any thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: Well, I've given that a lot of thought and I can't tell you exactly why, because there's no way to prove the reason for Chicago being there.  But there are a couple of elements that clearly lead to the type of progress that we saw within the black community here.  One, you've already mentioned was the fact that Chicago was an extremely segregated city. Remember, in 1967 and '66 [1966] with Marquette Park [Chicago neighborhood where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. marched during the Civil Rights Movement], even Dr. King called us "One of the most segregated cities in America, if not the most segregated city in America."  So having such a large population that was a fairly wealthy population by comparison to black communities in southern cities.  Because remember, people came here in the '20s [1920s] and the '30s [1930s] because of the stockyards, because of jobs, because of ways that really developed at least the income part of the financial equation, so there was this money in the community.  Then you had the numbers.  You had a significant population of black people, and then beyond that, you had a group that really essentially knew each other.  So the-as Chicago developed, you know, there was a lot of ability for these people to continue to work together as the city developed.  So that if you look at some of the businesses outside of the entrepreneurial firms whether it's a--you know, as later came along cable companies or investments and things like this, these same guys were all involved together.  In the same sense that they were all involved together in funding and supporting Civil Rights Movement.  So it's become a tradition of networking.  That's--that's real critical when you talk about how do you develop economic mass.  How do you develop--you know, there's no surprise that Chicago developed probably more black banks than any other city in the country.  Why?  Because these same people are at the foundation of almost every one of these financial institutions.  And that's real critical to the success of our community, today as it was then.
Speaker 1: But the question is still, you know, "Why, still--?"
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Well I--.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) You know, because we have the crabs in the--you know, I mean there's the typical things that have kept black people from you know, making accomplishments, and a lot of times it's the crabs in the barrel syndrome.  Yet, you know, people came--still came--I mean they've been successful.  That's all I'm saying.
Speaker 2: Well but another factor also is that if you look at, for example, the New York [New York] population. The New York population of African Americans are traditionally people that have migrated north from North and South Carolina, okay.  And you can look at other cities.  But Chicago, people came from everywhere.  So it was a combination of backgrounds, capabilities, and again, the numbers.  You know, when you, when you look at the size of the population here, it is even today only second to New York.  But when you look at the homogenous nature of the population here it's probably second to none in the country.  And that is a real critical element. You know, someone told me a long time ago people do business with people they know.  And if that's got any truth to it, then it is certainly a part of what makes Chicago a unique foundation for African American businesses.

Speaker 1: You know, I think that the legacy of Chicago [Illinois] has been the fact that opportunities can be created here. They are not necessarily just hanging off the vine.  But there is clearly a mechanism that works in Chicago that allows things to happen, despite the obstacles.  And that's true even to this day.  I mean, when you look at the development that Don Jackson [television executive and production company founder] is doing in the media world.  I mean this is--this is an unprecedented type of development.  Look at John Rogers [Jr., investment fund manager] in the financial world [Ariel Capital Management].  Again, you know, truly an outstanding accomplishment. You look at, you know, the creation of the hair care companies that came out of Chicago.  These things are not happening here by accident.  And it's again, a large part of it is that there's a nucleus and there are also role models.  You know, you can't under estimate or diminish the fact that if I watch someone do something, then I believe that I can also do it.  And in Chicago, we've been blessed to have a lot of these people. Jacoby Dickens [bank chairman], you know Dempsey Travis [real estate entrepreneur].  So what are we talking about?  Financial, real estate, manufacturing--some of the attorneys, Jim [James] Montgomery [civil rights attorney] and some of the people that have really kind of done a lot of the trailblazing--Earl Neal [attorney]. From an architectural standpoint, people like Bill [William] Brazley [architect] who has built, you know, skyscrapers in downtown Chicago.  If I see you, I know you, and I watch you do something, then you know what?  I might believe that I can also do it.
Story_ID: 9079
Speaker 1: Now how old were you when Johnson publics--Johnson Products [Company] went public?  Were you in high school or college?
Speaker 2: I was actually in high school when we first went over the counter. And in fact, I was in high school when we went on the American Stock Exchange.
Speaker 1: Can you describe that whole process?  I mean, you know, you're fairly older.  You're not five years old so you have some idea.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: You've worked there, you know, every summer.
Speaker 2: Yes. I think one of the things I would describe about that process even in those days is that it was chaotic.  I mean there was a lot of activity going in order to make a public filing.  And I recall, you know, just being in the office all of these people from what was then Hornblower and Weeks [brokerage firm] which was the primary underwriter of the public offering, as well as attorneys and bankers and, you know--just a lot of people involved that were not normally around the office. The company also was at the process where it was growing very rapidly.  So, you know, there were other new people that were coming in as part of our staff and development, and at that point Afro Sheen [hair product] sales were, you know, climbing literally every month, and it was kind of a new brand on the market that had been introduced in 1967.  And it was just a very, very exciting time.  At the point that Johnson Products went public, the company had been growing of a compounded rate of about 35 percent annually. And that's phenomenal growth. And it was at that point also, very much in kind of the spotlight, not only because it was going public, but because of the awareness of the brands, and that's just prior to our involvement with 'Soul Train' [music television show]. So at that point we were also doing--in fact, Johnson Products developed the first two hour special ever aired on television. And that was--the first one was called 'And Beautiful One.'  And that was the first time that Redd Foxx [comedian] ever appeared on television.  And the second one was called 'And Beautiful Two.'  And that had everyone from [Julian] Cannonball Adderley [saxophonist]--so we had done a number of specials which in--as you can imagine in 1969, 1970, '71 [1971], there were not a lot of black sponsored and created and produced specials, on TV, and certainly not at 120 minutes.
Speaker 1: And so how did that whole going public come about?  It's just--it seems--I mean that seems like a thing that people wanted in the '80s [1980s]. There was this huge gap anywhere between, you know, this--Johnson Products going public and any other African American company going public for a long time.  Actually how many people have bought companies? I mean but--is it the only one?
Speaker 2: Today?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No, it's not the only one.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But I'm saying there was this huge gap--but what was the motivation?  What--were the lawyers the one that were motivation.  I'd heard that Ernest LaFontant [attorney] played as--you know, he was sort of the brainchild from what I had heard, you know that. But was that the case?  Was it your--I mean how did this even come about?
Speaker 2: Well, I would say that Ernest was clearly a strong motivator in the concept. Because what he was trying to do was to help George Johnson [entrepreneur, Johnson's father] develop this solution to an--to the issue which was, "I have a company that's growing very rapidly. My estate is growing.  What's the value of it?  How do I establish a position where number one, I'm not vulnerable to being manipulated from a distribution standpoint."  And so there was some protection in being a public company. Remember that some of the things that were going on at that point--I would say that were alleged to be going on at that point were that there was a lot of pressure being brought in the music industry for distribution of the record products.  And that was specifically directed at Chess [Records] and Motown [Records] and some of those companies. And so one of the ways that you could at that point kind of protect yourself was by raising the visibility of the company, so that you were somewhat less likely to be intimidated from a distribution standpoint.  And going public clearly resolved that.  It also placed a value on the asset of Johnson Products that could not be denied.  So the government couldn't later say, "Well, it's worth this, or it's worth that."  Because you consider, you know, what happens in the event that that this is now part of an estate.  And so that was the other benefit.  And of course, the third and probably equally strong motivating factor is you've built a business since 1954. You've essentially been in a position of taking salary out of the business.  And so one of the ways to really reap the benefit, financially, of the business, as well as to incent some of the officers and other people around you is to be a public company.  Because now all of a sudden, you are in a position to create value as well as liquidity without giving up control of the business, and to simultaneously incent officers and other people involved in the company.  And at that point I would say they look to the future of being able to use stock to acquire other businesses.
Speaker 1: But, you know, it's easy enough for you to say. You have your MBA [Master's of Business Administation] and all of that.  I'm just saying it--you know, this was pretty visionary back then.
Speaker 2: Well I think starting Johnson Products Company was pretty visionary (laughs).  So I don't--I don't consider any of that to be different.  But I'm not really giving you an analysis as to how I think it is today looking back.  I'm really kind of giving you a feel for all the things that were discussed at the time that it was being done.  And so, you know, yes it is visionary.  But it's--it's also part of the story.
Story_ID: 9080
Speaker 1: Now I--you mentioned an interesting thing, and I'm not, you know, from Chicago [Illinois]--the relationship between Johnson Products [Company] and 'Soul Train' [television show]?  What was that?
Speaker 2: 'Soul Train' was a local television program here on channel 26.  And somehow or another my dad [George Johnson] was watching the program or was told about the program.  And I remember that at one point Don Cornelius [host of TV show 'Soul Train'] was doing the program, and then this fellow Clinton Gent [television personality], I don't know if you remember him, was also involved in the production.  And we actually acquired 'Soul Train.'  And we owned it for the first four years that it was out in California.  So we acquired all the rights to it and moved it from Chicago to Metromedia Studios and began the production of 'Soul Train.'  So if you ever saw one of the early episodes of 'Soul Train,' every single commercial on there was a Johnson Products commercial.  It was literally our show.  And I think after the second going into the third year, we eventually sold some portion--I think it was two minutes out of each show to 7-Up [soft drink company].  And they were the first company to be kind of a participating sponsor with us.  And pretty much typical to the way that George Johnson operates, he felt that Don, who had a real vested interest in the show, and was the MC [master of ceremonies], and, and the creator of the show--should have an opportunity to own it and really make it his own business.  And so about the fifth or the sixth year, they started a process where the equity of the business was shifted back to Don Cornelius.  And that's really the show that remains on the air to this day.
Story_ID: 9081
Speaker 1: At what point do you think that Johnson Products [Company] sort of came on the radar screen of the majority America?
Speaker 2: I think the---if you talk about the majority of America--.
Speaker 1: I'm talking about major--I'm talking about white America.  You know, where it was, it was a force to be reckoned with.  Do you think that people really did really--you know, 'cause you were talking about the whole going public.
Speaker 2: Yeah--I think at the point that Johnson Products went public, it really got on the radar screen of America. Because, you know, here was a company that in those years was, let's say making,  on sales of twenty million dollars would have a profit of about six [million dollars].  You know, and at one point was sitting on about nine and a half million dollars in cash. Those are not, you know, the kind of numbers that--for a company with sales less than thirty million dollars--it attracted a lot of attention.  And so that's the negative side of going public, is that all of your business, most of your strategy, and clearly your performance is a matter of public record.  And it invites competition.  And it did in the case of Johnson Products Company. Most severely, that competition didn't always play fair.  And specifically in the case of the [hair] relaxer business, which Johnson Products created and developed the--and I'm talking about Ultra Sheen relaxers [hair product] and so forth. You know, the FTC [Federal Trade Commission] got involved with a restraining order that was requiring companies to label their products as being quote "hazardous" under conditions of misuse.  And the FTC brought Johnson Products in as clearly one of the major equity holders of that market, and had convinced George Johnson [Johnson's father] that, you know, this consent order was being signed by everyone.  And for a two year period, it was in fact signed by everyone except Revlon. And Revlon was able to use that period to say to the black consumer that, you know, "Our product doesn't have to have this warning label like Ultra Sheen or like other products."  And really created a truly unfair climate for competition.  And today, you know, we can look back at it and we see that, you know, that same chairman of the FTC [Simon H. Rifkind] gave the eulogy at Charles Revson's [founder of Revlon] funeral and, you know, so there, there a lot of connections if you will that existed.  And if you understand those kind of connections, again it goes back to why the company did go public in the first place.
Speaker 1: That's interesting. So you're saying they were allowed to operate outside of that protection or--.
Speaker 2: Outside of the consent order.
Speaker 1: Out of the consent order.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Totally outside of the consent order.  And we really didn't get a response until we threatened to sue the FTC.  And we probably should have sued the FTC much earlier in the process, because Johnson Products and the Ultra Sheen brand began losing significant market share to Revlon at that point in time.
Speaker 1: That's right. Now--but I thought it was an issue--weren't they promoting their product as "no-lye?"
Speaker 2: Well "no-lye" came along a lot later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: "No-lye" is a matter of definition.  And the one--the tradition relaxer was based in sodium hydroxide, and the quote "no-lye" was based in calcium hydroxide.  And they have--calcium hydroxide in and of itself is pretty harmless.  It's almost like a cream.  So it requires an activator which is added, which them makes it probably just as caustic, just as active an ingredient as sodium hydroxide.  But again, from the standpoint of if the--if the definition of lye is sodium hydroxide.  Then this is not sodium hydroxide and it's therefore, not lye.
Story_ID: 9082
Speaker 1: I want to go back the question you thought I was asking, and that was about the success.  You know, where--the growth curve for Johnson [Products Company].  You know, here your father [George Johnson] is, you know, he's got this $250.  You know, he's traveling around putting 150,000 miles on his car a year.  At what point did it sort of take off?  Was it an underground market at the beginning?  Was it--.
Speaker 2: No. Johnson Products began as a professional product line.  So the Ultra Wave [hair product] line was sold in barber shops.  And the Ultra Sheen [hair product] line was developed for women to be sold through beauty shops.  And it really was intent--that was the intent, that was the focus and direction of the company.  In fact, we used to have schools that beauticians would have to come to and get a certification before we would even allow them to use the product.  I think the ethics that--probably because his background was chemistry, and his understanding of how you really successfully market a product, and when you think back to how we--how he created Ultra Wave in the first place, it was to define and develop a product that performed consistently.  Well, a consistent performing product in the hands of an untrained professional is still going to give you an unpredictable finish.  So it was through the training and education that both of those lines developed.  So unless you were involved in beauty shops, salons or barbershops, you really didn't know much about the brand.  Ultra Sheen began--and the product line at that time had cream shampoos and then a conditioner was developed in 1958, which was called Hair and Scalp Conditioner.  And those products began sifting out through distributors into the retail stores.  And so Johnson Products found itself in the position of having the number one brand in the retail store, and we weren't even selling to retail stores.  So about 1958, the decision was made to take the brand into retail stores.  And of course, that was a growth process and took a period of time, because first you had to develop sections.  Most stores didn't have sections that were devoted to ethnic health and beauty aids.  And so that the early days were spent convincing retailers that it made sense to allocate shelf space to this category.  Probably the brand--aside from Ultra Sheen's success, the brand that probably gave Johnson Products its greatest household name was Afro Sheen. And the whole advertising campaign with 'Wantu Wazuri' [Swahili for 'beautiful people'] that was developed by Vince Cullers [Advertising, Inc.] here in Chicago [Illinois].  And, you know, the, the afro and the times and this Afro Sheen became synonymous with the times, that really put Johnson Products into the average household's vocabulary if you will.
Story_ID: 9083
Speaker 1: When was the company [Johnson Products Company] at its peak?  You were saying at--was it at its peak when it went public?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Okay.
Speaker 2: Probably the company was at its peak in about 1977, '78 [1978].  And then it resurged in the early '80s [1980s] with General Treatment, and then began a plateau.  And Johnson Products sales stayed in the thirty-five to twenty-nine million dollar level in that period.  And so it kind of plateaued.  And the plateau was created by a couple of things.  One, obviously you have a lot of new competitors coming into the marketplace.  And at that point, both white and black competitors. The second thing is that you had shifting of product lines. So at one point Johnson Products was very heavily involved in make-up lines.  We had Ultra Sheen facial fashions and were involved in mascaras and eyeliners and so forth, and later took those product lines out.  So the business had spent a lot of money and both product development, and had fairly large inventories, and still a need to do a lot of retail marketing and advertising.
Story_ID: 9084
Speaker 1: Tell us how the whole--expansion into Nigeria of Johnson Products [Company] came about.
Speaker 2: Well, the Nigerian venture started with exports that were going to Nigeria.  And as we began to get involved in this whole international arena--because up until probably the early '70s [1970s] virtually all the business of Johnson Products was domestic.  But then at the point of '70s [1970s] is this--the Afro and the hairstyles and--but even beyond the Afro, because Africans didn't wear many Afros.  That, that was not their, their style.  But as this whole assimilation, if you will, with Western dress, Western style, really took place primarily in West Africa.  Then we began to look at the opportunities to really develop Nigeria as a country. The incentive for Nigeria was that you had about 100 million black people.  Now you compare that to the population of the United States, and it was oil rich, and it you know--so therefore you had--and it had an agricultural economy, and, you know, it was a boom place if you will, of the early '70s [1970s] despite some of the other problems such as, you know, internal land transportation and so forth.  So we began to look at Nigeria as a good export market, and then really looked at the difficulty of ocean freight, the time, and the size of the market, and made a commitment to develop through Nigerian partners a Johnson Products Nigeria Limited.  So after years of exporting products there, we actually went out to Ikorodu [Nigeria] and built a factory.  And that factory developed some of the primary products--not a full line of the products that were developed in the U.S., but a subset of those products which were very popular on the Nigerian market.  One of the things that was interesting as we, you know, developed the lines is first of al,l in the Nigerian mentality, still what came from the U.S. was at least as--it was actually more valuable than the product that we produced there because there was this perception that if it came from the U.S. it was a quote "better product" than what was produced there.  But nonetheless for the--for many years the company there did well.  The overriding issue was aside from the difficulties that you had with the government in terms of just clearing goods and things that were required to run the business, machinery would sit in customs forever, you know, any kind of chemicals that you had to send there to support that operation, it was very difficult to move things through the--the process.  But also the currency started to devalue. The naira was a landlocked currency.  And as a result, it was not tradable anywhere outside of Nigeria.  And so where we started in an environment where they naira was 1.7 naira to a dollar, you know, we later wound up in an environment where you could get 30 naira for a dollar. And that, combined with the activity of Central Bank [of Nigeria] and how long it took to clear dividends to get out, you know, you could declare dividends today of a million dollars, and by the time you got it out of the bank and cleared it into the U.S. you were probably at, if you were lucky, if it was worth 200,000.  Because the decline in the currency.  And that, plus the overall business climate of whether it's anything that had to do with certificates or certifications, or license, et cetera was just extremely difficult.  So in 1988 I eventually sold that--while I was President/CEO [Chief Executive Officer], sold the company to be 100 percent Nigerian owned.
Speaker 1: So what was it do you think you learned out of that whole experience?  You know, or Johnson Products learned out of the--'cause doing business internationally is a whole, you know whole separate type of thing.
Speaker 2: Well I don't know that the experience of Johnson Products is so unique. I think that companies today, while we're becoming more global and more international, still issues of currency devaluation impact everyone's financials.  And the--currency devaluations are still going on, or changes in currency value are still going on.  So some companies have an environment where, you know, it's up this quarter, down the next quarter, up this year down the next year.  But it's a reality of being global.  Probably one of the things that you have to look at also is how do you really create an environment where either you develop a new brand for that market, or you generate ways of really positioning yourself to be a preferred item that's produced locally.  And--and that requires a lot of marketing investment.  So you really need to have a very strong and committed strategy in any form of international development, whether it's Nigeria or otherwise.  So the issues of Johnson Products and Nigeria developed today at McDonald's [Corporation], you know, going into now 118 countries.  They are experiencing the same type of growth pains.  And so it's--it's consistent with the environment.
Story_ID: 9085
Speaker 1: Johnson Products [Company]--I want to go back to, you know, its success.  Do you think it was a combination of your father's [George Johnson] vision, the market need for the product, a good product, timing, you know, just the timing in the country, maybe the Civil Rights Movement playing a part, you know, the fact that there were Afros--I mean all those things sort of came together.  But, what, what would be your view on the--you know, on the success?  And even the advertising, you talked about the advertising campaign with Vince Cullers [Advertising, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: I think the timing is a lot in a business.  And clearly Johnson Products was at the right place at the right time with the right product.  Now that didn't happen by magic.  So someone had to envision that this was the right time with the right products to serve a marketplace.  And I think that to that extent, Johnson Products clearly in its developmental, and let's say its first twenty years of its history, did an excellent job of meeting the needs of the marketplace.  When you think in terms of, you know, the overall environment for the country, it was also very much in tune with that.  Again going back to this cooperative nature, I can recall, and it's fairly well documented, that Johnson Products paid 'Essence' magazine, you know, for its full year's advertising in advance.  Why?  Because it helped the magazine to survive, and it helped to create a vehicle where both of us could win.  And so we can't win if the magazine goes down, and the magazine can't win if it doesn't get advertising. That type of environment, those types of what today would be unprecedented business moves are all a part of the success.  The other part of the success is, when you look back at those times, it was very easy to go into almost any city in the country.  If you wanted to reach the black consumer, you had one, maybe two radio stations.  You had one newspaper.  You had no channels on television.  So therefore, 'Soul Train' [television show] was an extremely effective vehicle for the company because it would bring the viewers to that channel. Because there was a need, a perceived benefit to black households to watch a black oriented program.  After all, it had the latest in music.  It had, you know, very attractive young people dancing.  It had a very articulate announcer.  So a lot of the dynamics, if you will, of how you would market--even from a national media standpoint, you know, you had 'Essence' and you had 'Ebony' [magazine], and you had 'Jet' [magazine].  And that was it.  And so, you know, it provided a vehicle where we could talk to our consumer with a pretty direct focus.  Today that's completely different.  I mean, there are 200 channels on TV.  There are five [black] radio stations in just Chicago [Illinois] and that's twenty-four hour stations, there are probably seven or eight total black-focused or oriented stations in Chicago, and that's true in many cities.  So how do you reach that consumer? There are twenty-five black-oriented publications on the news stand.  So as a result, you don't find today, the kind of dominance that companies had going back twenty years ago.  So--and our marketplace has become more fragmented as it should, because our needs are more specific today.  And we have a broader group of customers with a broader group of flavor, preferences, or lifestyles, and that is part of the consequence of progress.
Story_ID: 9086
Speaker 1: You went to Babson College [Wellesley, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And why did you choose Babson at the time?  And how, how did you end up choosing Boston [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: I actually never chose Boston, but it's a very funny story how I chose Babson. We spoke about the fact that I went into--that I went to the University of Chicago Lab[oratory High] School [Chicago, Illinois].  And in the junior year when you start the counseling process, you know, you meet with your counselor and discuss your career goals, and so forth.  And I've also stated that, you know, I was as serious as I felt I needed to be as a student.  So I walked into the college counselor's office. And in my normal style, asked him what was the best business school in the country.  And he made the mistake of responding to me, "Babson College, but you don't need to apply."  And that was just about all I needed to hear.  I remember going home that evening and telling my mother [Joan Henderson Johnson] and father [Henry Johnson], "Hey guys, I'm going to Babson College."  And I was totally committed at that point that there was no place--in fact, I don't think I filled out more than two other applications, and those were what I considered backup.  And sure enough, I got into Babson College and graduated with a 3.4 average.  So it was a whole different experience.
Speaker 1: So you had raised the bar at that point?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you--were you happy with your education you got there?  Did you like the experience?  How was the East Coast versus, you know, having grown up here in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't like the East Coast.  You know, I'm not--I think as a result--put it--to say I don't like the East Coast is unfair.  I was not real happy about Wellesley and Boston. Boston was a real cultural shock for me. We've already discussed the nature of the black community here in Chicago, and in comparison to the black community in Boston it was like, "I cannot believe that this exists."  You know, even though this was the late '60s [1960s].  And, you know, black people in Boston didn't even own a record store.  I mean, things that you just took for granted--a grocery store, a restaurant.  There was one restaurant, Bob The Chef's, and we ate there often. It was, it was a real cultural shock.  And I think I related all of that back to colonial and so forth, and you know, to this day, I don't really care for colonial style or--but from the standpoint of education, I got a great education at Babson, and I got a great education because I was involved in things within the school.  Specifically the beginning of what today is a very well identified program at Babson, which is the Entrepreneurial Studies Program.  A Professor Jack Hornaday really began that program.  And the year that he did, which I'm thinking back was 1971, I was the student representative to the Management Department.  So I got to be involved in the real incubator think-tank part of how do we develop an Entrepreneurial Studies Program.  Which  today, a student can go to Babson and actually get a degree in Entrepreneurship.  So from the standpoint of--also thinking of role models, you know, I went to school with Edsel Ford [Ford Motor Company CEO] and [William] Bill Chapin whose dad at that time ran American Motors [Corporation].  And, you know, [George] Westinghouse and people that represented large businesses.  And you know, Babson was fairly unknown at that time.  But Standard and Poor's started on Babson's campus.  So it was, it was a, you know, it was just a absolute perfect fit for me to fulfill that dream I've had since I was four or five years old, which was to be involved in business.
Story_ID: 9087
Speaker 1: How did you actually feel that everybody in the country--I mean Soft Sheen [hair product] was the hottest product. You were pretty young at that point.  You know, you're sort of--were you humble?  Were you--you know, were you--were you, you know, sort of part of a--I mean, how did you feel about that?  You know, everybody is wearing Soft Sheen, have they heard, you know, who are you, and I'm, you know, I'm part of Johnson Products [Company], or my father owns Johnson Products?
Speaker 2: Well at that point that Soft Sheen became popular, it was really part of a whole trend shift in fashion within the country.  So people were moving away from relaxers, they perceived these curls as being less harsh on hair than relaxers.  And, you know, I personally didn't really feel intimidated or in any way offset by the growth of another black business. For one, I was glad that it was a Soft Sheen as opposed to Jheri Redding or some of the other companies that had been pioneers of the technology, if you will.  But the other thing is that just personally I didn't care for the style.  You know, this wet, drippy, keep, you know, pouring lotions on it.  And I think as a result Johnson Products probably did a less than fully motivated entry into the market.  It took us a long time to decide that this was even a marketplace worth pursuing, or one that we wanted to pursue.  And so if you look at Soft Sheen's introduction versus a Classy Curl [hair product] or some of the things that we developed later it was just a market place that quite frankly we missed.  And those things happen in business.  But at the same time through those years, our professional brands and other brands within Johnson Products were involved in the Nigerian expansion were keeping the company fairly busy.  But--and, and General Treatment [hair product] was starting to really take off as a relaxer product.  And, so no, there wasn't a feeling that, well, you know, somehow or another that we've pass the torch to Soft Sheen.

Speaker 1: You graduate from Babson [College, Wellesley, Massachusetts].  Was there always an--was there an expectation on the part of your, you know, father [George Johnson], your parents that you would come back and work in the business?  Because you ended up going to Colgate [-Palmolive Company] right?
Speaker 2: Procter & Gamble [Corporation].
Speaker 1: I mean Procter & Gamble, I'm sorry.  So was there that anticipation?  Or was that encouragement, or was it find that--you know, or was it that go off and learn, you know, how to do it right and come back to us?  I mean--.
Speaker 2: It was kind of all of that. My dad fully supported me going to Procter & Gamble.  And Procter & Gamble was well aware of who I was and there attitude was, "Well if he came here to learn, he'll probably do a good job."  And, and I did. It was--the deciding factor for me was that as I came out of college and started working the company, everything I did was okay.  So if I didn't fill out expense reports, if I didn't, you know, follow procedures no one was gonna complain.  And I decided within the first three months of that, that in order for me to, to really be successful long term, number one,  I needed a different level of discipline,  And number two, I wanted a different set of experiences so that I could come in and offer something to people that I'm around because prior to that, most of my working experience had been within Johnson Products Company.  So I really looked forward to being able to go to Procter & Gamble and learn from what at that time, was by almost all standards considered to be the best marketing and sales organization in the country.  And I began in selling products like Crest [toothpaste], Gleem [toothpaste], Scope [mouthwash], Head and Shoulders [shampoo], Prell [shampoo], little permanents that were very close to the products that we produced at Johnson Products, they were certainly health and beauty aids sold to the same retailers.  But I learned some of the techniques and skills that went along with general market companies.  And not only just general market companies, but the leader in development of skills and capabilities.  And Procter & Gamble had spent millions and millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of man hours in the development of their systems.  And it was just a tremendous learning experience for me.
Story_ID: 9089
Speaker 1: What strikes me is your very level-headed approach, you know, to things.  I mean that you--you know you went in sort of with a plan, and you know, you--It doesn't seem like--you're not a very cocky person--I mean are you--you're not a cocky person?  I mean here you are, you know, son of the black hair care dynasty [Johnson Products Company]--you know, dynasty, and you go sort of to cut your teeth, you know, at another place.  And sort of, you know, learn with a plan, it sounds like.
Speaker 2: Well I think in my mind it's always been about long-term success.  And remember I had this vision of this 'Fortune' [magazine] 500 company [annual list of largest companies in the U.S, ranked by revenue].  So Johnson Products was always a part of my plan, not, not a destination.  You know, it--this, this whole career development for me is a, is a journey.  And that's probably why even today, you know, now that Johnson Products is--has been sold and sold again, my business today is actually 50 percent larger than Johnson Products ever was.  So it's, it's a--and that's not a comparison.  But it--what I'm saying is that it's because I'm looking at a different mark.  I'm--I believe that if I do my homework, if I'm capable and prepared and able, then I can succeed.  And it's really a matter of, you know, setting the objectives.  And so even where our company is today, this will not be the same company in three years.  And so it's, it--I think I tell a lot of people that for me, it's not about business, it's not about how big you are.  It's a game, and I like to win.  And that's how I look at it. You know, strategically, you prepare yourself whether it's for a basketball game, a golf match, or whatever, and to be able to go and actually accomplish your objectives, to be able to dream of something today and see it in six months. To watch a person walk into the door of your organization that has potential but not polish, and you look at them a year or two later and they are a fully functioning and capable individual and growing, those are the things that to me represent winning.
Speaker 1: It's a skill though.  It a skill.  I mean it's a skill, but you must have had it at, you know, sort of naturally.  But that's a skill.
Speaker 2: Well, I've been blessed in my life.  I've had all these people that we've talked about around me, that have demonstrated the skill.  That--I believed I that I can do it because I watched other people do it.
Story_ID: 9090
Speaker 1: At what point did you decide it was time to leave Procter & Gamble [Corporation]?  And then--you know, what was your motivation going to--back to business school?
Speaker 2: Well I basically set pretty much a two year timeframe on Procter & Gamble in my mind. To be honest with you what--what encouraged me to leave was there was a fellow that got promoted, that I felt I deserved the promotion.  Then they made the mistake of giving me this guy's territory.  And between January and March of that year I sold a full year's quota in his territory and then quit.  And so everyone from the regional manager to the district manager, you know, called to find out, you know, why was I leaving.  And I just told them, you know, point blank, "I'm ready to leave."  But the real motivation was, you know, every day I went out from January to March writing record orders in his sales books.  It just thrilled me to death.  I had, I had--one supermarket had almost three thousand cases of Crest [toothpaste].  It went from the entryway all across the front. And so--it, it also let me know, you know, the kind of bar--if you really want to internally raise the bar and, and accomplish something that's, you know, maybe it's never been done before, that it's possible.
Speaker 1: So now you--so you're back at U of C [University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, Chicago, Illinois]--you're back sort of home at that point.
Speaker 2: Home but it doesn't feel like home, because graduate school is a whole different ballgame than undergraduate school.  And it's a whole different ballgame at the U of C than high school [University of Chicago Laboratory High School, Chicago, Illinois].  So it was--it was a different experience.  It was a--the University of Chicago is extremely technical, extremely quantitative.  And my background had never been as quantitative as the University of Chicago, so I lost a lot of pounds sitting in Regenstein Library (laughs) trying to make sure that, you know, I could stay up with the quantitative side of all of the information that was coming through in the classroom.
Speaker 1: 'Cause really you would have, you would have Northwestern [University's] Kellogg [School of Management, Evanston, Illinois].  Is more marketing-oriented.
Speaker 2: It's true.
Speaker 1: And that's, and that's--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) It's true.
Story_ID: 9091
Speaker 1: At the point that you were at U of C business school [University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, Chicago, Illinois] was it always a plan at that point to go back?  Or was it circumstances that brought you back?
Speaker 2: To go back to Johnson Products [Company]?
Speaker 1: To Johnson Products, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was--clearly I felt that I had gone to the outside and gotten the Procter and Gamble [Corporation] experience.  Now I was going to get the next level of the academic experience.  And that--when I came back to Johnson Products, I wasn't going anywhere after that.  So from '72 [1972], when I graduated, to '77 [1977] when I finished at the U of C, you know that five year period.  I spent a lot of the time away from the company.  But having completed those things I was then ready to really kind of get focused on getting to the top of Johnson Products.
Speaker 1: Okay. So it was clearly laid out almost as a succession plan.  What--was the succession plan in there?
Speaker 2: I wouldn't say so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We never really discussed it.  Between my dad [George Johnson] and myself or even in our family. And I think it was probably the intent of my dad to run the company for a very long time.  And as cirumcstances occurred that--with a number of things that happened.  It just--it led itself to an ability to turn at the top.  But I think one of the things that clearly led to that was the four losses in the previous five years.  You know, all of a sudden it, it became a realistic thought that maybe there's someone else that should be making the day-to-day decisions.  Now that doesn't mean that he moved away from the company altogether, because that did not occur.  But from the day-to-day managing of the business, that it needed more technical, it needed more--I think my Dad would say that he's the entrepreneur, and that I'm the professional manager.
Story_ID: 9092
Speaker 1: Did you find in that whole process, do you think your father [George Johnson] at that time lost, you know, maybe for some time interest in the business?  I know there were things happening personally, but do you think he during--or do you think he was just tired--you know, it went public.  A lot of times people talk--once things go public, it just become a hassle 'cause there are all these filings.  You know, and do you think he became tired?
Speaker 2: I think that--number one, I would say he never lost focus of the business. But he was the type of person that let people run their areas, that kind of work through people--that's his style.  And so as a result, if things are not necessarily going in the direction that you want it to go in, you can kind of do the coaching counsel part in meetings and in trying to get people to focus.  But you don't necessarily get the implementation or the execution on the other side.  And so it's--it becomes negotiating strategy with the managers and his vice presidents.  And at the point in 1988, when I became president of the company, we had eight vice presidents.  And most of them had quote "made it."  Well six months later, I had three vice presidents.  And all of a sudden the business is turning, and it's real clear that if you're going to make it in this organization, it's about performance.  And I let people go.  That--because they had been with, George Johnson for a long time, he never would have.  And while it was painful for him to watch, he understood that it was necessary for the survival of the business.  And I think he was very happy that I had to do it instead of him.
Speaker 1: So you came in as a young--as a young barracuda in many ways.  You know, the, the change artist.  The--.
Speaker 2: Well, I wouldn't say that I came in as the young barracuda because again, I didn't start out as president.  So I, you know, had managed professional sales.  I had managed over all corporate sales.  I had built the private label division of the company.  And, and my style was pretty consistent. It was then and remains today about performance, because again, if you like to win the game, you can't win the game by kind of shuffling along on the sidelines.  You have to win the game by active, accurate and high impact participation.  And I believe that's still very much what it takes to win as I did then.  So, it's not at all that--that I was this barracuda.  But on the other had, I made it real clear that my job is to be there for the people who are going to survive for the future of the company.  You know, one morning prior to going to work I'm thinking that, you know, I've got four hundred employees.  They have an average of two and a half people in a family.  Then you add together all of your suppliers and what your business means to them.  So you probably have five or six thousand people that are depending upon your performance.  So if you've got five or six thousand people, then I'm certainly gonna say that those numbers are more important to me than twenty or thirty people that are blocking our ability to perform.
Story_ID: 9093
Speaker 1: When I became president of Johnson Products [Company], that day the company announced a 4.7 million dollar loss.  Which was the fourth loss in the previous five years.  And I quickly surmised that either I was gonna be the person who was going to turn this business around, or I would be known as the person at the helm of it when it went down.  And, again, you know, this--this desire to win and my feelings about the preparation that--you know, I'd been at Procter & Gamble [Corporation, consumer products company], been to graduate school, I had spent all my life here. That if anybody was gonna be capable of turning the business around, that--I certainly was in my mind, the top candidate to do so. The second thought that entered my mind that anyone that thought that I got into the position because I was the son of George Johnson [founder of Johnson Products], in the process of turning the business around, I would clearly dispel any rumors that Eric did this because he was George Johnson's son.  That I would be--have an opportunity to establish myself as a qualified and capable executive on my own right.  And that was kind of the attitude with which I approached the business at that time.  And we did a number of things.  First, internally, restructured the business.  And that means by department.  I think, I've discussed earlier, reducing the number of vice presidents, the departments created more synergy between the activities in the business, looked at the plant operations, which I was very familiar with from having run the private label division of the company, and started to doing a lot of streamlining, but more importantly, efficient work flows.  And the numbers.  And I would watch the numbers on a daily basis from both the standpoint of production in sales, profitability.  And we developed a number of financial models that we could track our performance on.  Probably the toughest thing to do initially was to reestablish a more favorable financing for the company.  Because again, the company is losing a lot of money, over time, when I inherited the helm of the company, we were playing paying prime plus four in an asset based financial arrangement, which really works against turnarounds.  Because if you're asset based, it means that your availability of capital is based on the value of your inventory, and value of your receivables and so forth.  Well one of the ways to turn business around is to make inventories more efficient.  And in making inventories more efficient, you shrink them.  And so as a--result of that, we had a pretty short timeframe I thought, to really start to execute the turnaround.  And we had some other things that were happening in the business, some sale of property and so forth that I felt could help.  And it in fact did.  So the first year we made a profit of $2 million.  We were able to come out of the financing into LaSalle Bank at that time, which gave us a much more favorable term.  And three years later the company didn't have any of the debt.  So it, it was a financial management turnaround as well as trying to reposition the company.  So in that process we acquired the M&M Products Company, Sta-Sof-Fro [hair care product] and those brands, out of Atlanta [Georgia]. And that helped to really kind of bolster the profitability in the second and third year, along with growth of our existing brands.  Which is, [Jheri] Curl was starting to decline.  Our relaxer products were starting to increase again.  And so you would think, you know, the stock is trading at $2.50 on the day that I become president, and the day I left it's trading at $26, and you think to yourself, "Well, you know, what's, what's wrong with this picture?"  But somehow in the back of my mind I kept hearing this voice that said, "This is not it."  And it was very disturbing.  And I don't know to this day why that voice came.  But I know that it created a great deal of unrest within me because after all, this had been my lifelong dream.  And you know, what I--there's a part of me that says, "This is artificial. This is not what, what you're here to do."  And I kept really trying to deny that I'm, that I'm hearing this.  And it got to a point where I said, "Well, maybe if we, if we do something different it will re-engage my, my motivation.  Maybe this, this will,"  and when I say motivation, it's, it's not that I changed my style or how I was running the business, but my enthusiasm for it was, was greatly diminished by this, by this concept that, you know, maybe this doesn't lead to where you want it to lead.  And we tried to do a private transaction, take the company off of the public market, bring it back into private ownership, with banks and--actually at that point you didn't have the type of investment opportunities that exist today through investment bankers and capital partners and so forth.  But--through traditional banks.  And we really were not able to raise a sufficient amount of capital, in my opinion, to make the plan work as I had envisioned it to work.  And following the retraction of that offer, I truly got to a point where I can physically pinpoint the location of the office, which was the top of the first landing, when I would come into the building, for the last six months, I would feel like turning around and walking back out.  And it, it really got to a point where, you know, you're saying, "Well, we've done a lot, we've created a lot."  You know, and a lot of that momentum, if you will, that you developed with your--within your executive staff and within your employees overall comes from having clear goals and directives, and also having  objectives, and then when they make those objectives, there's a great feeling of accomplishment.  Well, I started running out of ideas because my creativity really wouldn't lend itself to, "How--how do we keep making it happen?"  And I--another part of me after a while didn't feel like making it happen.  So I decided that, "You know, maybe I ought to listen to this voice.  Maybe this isn't really what I'm intended to do."  And I started to talk within my family.  And, you know, there were some opportunities that, you know, maybe my sister [Joan Johnson] or my mother [Joan Henderson Johnson] wanted to take a stronger role in the company, and, and continue running as a public company.  But my overriding decision was based on this voice and the fact that the family only controlled 52 percent of the business.  So there comes a point in time where either through death or sale, or whatever, I don't want to be fifty years old and try to figure out, "What am I gonna do?"  And I felt at that point I had a good track record.  I had developed a good reputation, and that if I was ever going to really do something on my own, this was the time.  And I also, had had an experience with really building value. Because we made a lot of people happy going on the ride from $2.50 to $26 a share.  In 1991, Johnson Products was the seventh best performing stock on the American Stock Exchange.  That was long prior to today's environment where companies come out in the first day and, you know, sell at five times the published price.  So in looking at that whole concept, I decided that I had the courage to leave this very comfortable position in this well-established company, that really was my lifelong dream, because I began to believe both through my internal feelings as well as this voice, that this voice was right.  This was not what I'm here to do.
Story_ID: 9094
Speaker 1: In March of '92 [1992], [I] took the step to leave Johnson Products Company.  And at that point began looking at and thinking about what I wanted to do.  And the realization that--there were a couple of things. One, I did not want to leave Chicago [Illinois] under any circumstances, and number two--because this was where my not only my family base was, but also from the standpoint of what Chicago has to offer, in terms of financial institutions, in terms of marketplace, et cetera.  And began really through some conversations with my wife and other people to look at companies, and, you know, we kind of looked at Baldwin Ice Cream as being a--a business that was a well founded business and well recognized within the black community, but certainly had a lot of potential for expansion.  I did some research on the ice cream industry and realized that the largest brand share anywhere was Breyers [Ice Cream Company] and they only had 14 percent of the market.  And so then everyone else was down from their private label control, about 20 percent of it.  And so as we looked at from the marketing side, what it takes to succeed, and the fact that there were a lot of local brands in various markets.  So that if you go to Indianapolis [Indiana], for example and you talk about Dean's Ice Cream or Baldwin Ice Cream, no one ever heard of them.  But then we'd never heard of Angel Food or Yarnell's or some of the other brands that are sold around the country.  What that gave me a believe in was the fact that people would be amenable on a regional and local basis to looking at new brands.  Then I did the advertising analysis of it and realized that because no one, including Breyers, had 100 percent distribution across the country, you don't have any network advertising for ice cream.  So there was a way that we could segment markets and identify targets and be successful without having megamillion dollar advertising budgets.  And I met with Jolyn Robichaux one day for about three hours, and we essentially struck a deal in that very first conversation.  And it took us another three months to get the lawyers and all the other stuff done that accomplished it, but she had a believe that I would, in fact, grow the business.  And I quite frankly didn't realize until later how many people she had either rejected or gotten involved in discussions about her business.  And I later asked her, a couple of years later, "Jolyn, I hear all these people coming to me after we've acquired the company and telling me you know, that they tried to buy it.  So-and-so tried to buy it and blah-blah-blah.  How did you happen to sell it to me?"  She said, "Because, I believed you would do what you've done with it." And so it was a real compliment.  And so we began working on expanding and distribution improving the formulation, changing the packaging, some of that was somewhat involuntary, you know.  Baldwin used to have the "Chicago's Own" label on it.  And I remember being in a store, we had just gotten distribution in Atlanta [Georgia].  And the store manager says to me, "Son, you've got some very good ice cream.  But down here we ain't gonna buy none of that damn Yankee ice cream."  And I thought about it.  He said, "'Cause there's nothing civil about the Civil War." So I immediately came back and started looking at how do we get out of this "Chicago's Own,"  which--which had bothered me from the beginning.  Because Chicago is not a place that is necessarily known for ice cream.  But that cinched it, and so every since the point that we could get the new packaging ready which was about two months later, it says, "Since 1921."  But it was--it was a great business, because I understood the distribution, I understood a lot about the Chicago retailers, where the heart of the business was with Jewel [supermarket chain] and Dominick's [supermarket chain] and the chains here.  And I understood how to build distribution.  So I looked at Baldwin as being a great entree into what I considered to be my new industry, which was food.  The other thing I like about the food business is, if you think about where we are in ethnic health and beauty aids, if you have a product--you're advertising a product.  As soon as you say ethnic you're advertising to thirty out of a hundred.  If it's a product for women, it's fifteen out of a hundred.  If it's a curl product or relaxer product, it's probably seven or eight out of a hundred, and then when you get down to actual potential users, you may be promoting and targeting three or four out of a hundred.  And that's true whether it's a children's product, a men's product, however you look at our marketplace.  But you're spending a hundred pennies out of every dollar to market to the three or four or five or six people that are your potential customers.  In the food business, everybody eats every day.  And 97 percent of all households have freezers, and ice cream is one of the highest volume items in a grocery store.  So we have a ten billion dollar category where the largest market share is about 14 percent.  It certainly represented a lot of growth potential from my analysis.
Story_ID: 9095
Speaker 1: Were there any surprises for you that you've experienced in the food industry?  Or has it all been sort of--you know, that everything has led up to that point.  Are there any things that you've learned positively or--you know that--
Speaker 2: Well, there were a lot of surprises--not, not so much surprises but there--you know, you have to know how to adapt.  And so when you're coming out of a company like Johnson Products [Company] which at the time I left the sales were about forty million dollars  into a company that I acquired with sales of less than two million dollars, then at the point that we acquired it, you certainly can't approach it in the same way you do when you're running a forty million dollar company.  So because I've always been a hands-on type manager, I was comfortable with what was necessary to build a business.  And certainly comfortable with going out and talking to customers and developing the, the franchise for the brand.  But at the same time you have to be real creative.  Because from the customer side, whoever we're doing business with, they expected the same things from us that they did from [Good Humor-] Breyers [Ice Cream Company] or Edy's [Grand Ice Cream] and they--and they deserved it.  So we had to make sure that our company was profiled in such a way to respond to customers as if we were a ten million or fifty million dollar company.  But at the same time recognizing that we had a very limited budget and capability to get there.  So it was a real challenge.  And, you know, the company grew from, 1992 to 1997 by 410 percent.  And that really started to create an environment where we could look at some other options, and how do we really develop the business and how do we grow the business.  And I began talking with some financial institutions about acquiring other businesses. Ironically, the first business that they wanted me to talk about acquiring was Johnson Products Company.  And you know, I did the analysis. I went down and met with all of their head of mergers and acquisitions.  I even met with the chairman of the company that owned Johnson Products at the time.  And, you know, the closer I got to it, the more those feelings came back that I had when I left.  And I just absolutely could not convince myself that this was in the best interest of what I wanted to do, nor was I, pleased that--or, or felt that there was a price point that the negotiation was headed towards that made sense to me. So after evaluating it for a couple of months, made it real clear to the financial institution that we wanted to continue to work with you.  I think this is a good relationship for both of us.  But let's look at things that are in the food business.  You know, I'm not interested in any other cosmetic companies that come on the market.  I like the food business.  I want to stay in the food business.  And if you want to help us grow, then we'll grow on the basis of what we find in the food business.  And as things would happen, about six months later--got a call.  And they said, "Well we have this company.  We'd like to know if you'd be interested."  I said, "Well, tell me a little bit about it."  They said, "Well, it's, it's owned by a 'Fortune' [magazine] 100 company.  It's a spin-off of a subsidiary and they make dessert toppings and--."  Before he went any further I said, "Yeah, we're interested."  Because immediately in my mind this is a deepening of the involvement that we have in the dessert category in grocery stores--natural extension between desert toppings and ice cream.  Then they went on to say that it produces for McDonald's [Corporation] and it produces--you know, again, the green light went on in my mind.  Because being a native of Chicago [Illinois], having met quite a few people in the McDonald's organization through the years, and understanding their commitment not only to diversity and minority business development, but also being local and Chicago-based.  'Cause at that time, I wasn't sure this was a Chicago-based company.  But then they went on and told me what, what else was in it in terms of the product mix.  And we were extremely excited.  And initially it was strictly a matter of number crunching.  You know, I'm looking at the financials and so forth.  And evaluating how the products are performing.  And I was excited.  But the thing that really created the apex for me was when I went and saw the operation itself.  Because when I first walked into what was called Richardson Foods Company, I felt immediately at home.  Because while it doesn't necessarily register to people, but liquid products such as shake flavorings and syrups and hotcake syrups and ice cream toppings, these are all--mustards, ketchup, these are all liquid products and they go through the same type of machinery and equipment that cosmetics run through.  Because they're highly viscous liquids.  And so not only did I feel comfort with the--I knew the equipment.  I knew the machinery.  And I could evaluate how sophisticated their production processes were.  And then on top of that, I met the people.  And I felt extremely comfortable that the people were of the mindset that they were not necessarily these 'Fortune' 100 type factory workers.  These people were truly interested in doing a good job.  They were very proud of the environment that they were in.  And as I, you know, looked through the history again on paper, you know, you see where the business had been sold eight years earlier and prior to that.  And they were looking for someone that was really going to be interested in continuing the growth of the business. A lot of other people that looked at the company were looking at how to break it up.  And they wanted this part or that part, but not necessarily the whole thing.  And from our standpoint, we wanted the entire company and we wanted to keep it intact, and, and that was we went through the process of acquiring the business, that was a real key consideration that gave us a little more clout in negotiating than other companies, that simply wanted to break it up and eventually close the plant.
Speaker 1: So this is really an exciting time in your life in many ways.
Speaker 2: Oh, it is.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 2: It, it clearly is.
Story_ID: 9096
Speaker 1: What are your sales now and what are your plans for growth?
Speaker 2: Our sales right now are about $62 million and our plans for growth are that within three years, we envision ourselves being between 150 and 250 million dollar company.
Speaker 1: And what--how do you feel about this, this stage of your life?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't have any problem getting up in the morning (laughs). I feel that this is, you know, every morning I get up, I'm ready to go.  And I feel like this is the answer to that voice.  You know, this is the direction that--I feel very satisfied.  I feel complete.  I feel like I'm accomplishing and on the road that I'm supposed to be on.  For whatever that means.  And it probably doesn't mean as much to anyone else as it does to me.  But--and it's, it's amazing.  You know, even as I sit down with my parents [George Johnson and Joan Henderson Johnson], now.  It's just a whole different relationship.  And I watch my dad take pride in the things that we're doing now.  But it's--and it's a different kind of pride than just, you know, kind of running something that he created.  And I feel as if that this type of development, while a lot different than an entrepreneurial development, I'm probably not the traditional entrepreneur.  I don't feel that I possess the creativity to create something from an idea and develop it into a business. But I can look at a business and see ways of growing a business.  So I tend to acquire things as opposed to trying to create things.  While we do create new products within our businesses, that's not quite the same as being an entrepreneur. So I think my dad is right.  I'm probably the professional manager and not the entrepreneur.  Although when, you know, we run businesses people consider us to be entrepreneurs.  But I'm not--I'm not sure that label specifically fits the style in which I operate in.
Speaker 1: You're not a start-up guy?
Speaker 2: I'm not a start-up guy.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) So a lot of people would say in today's world that you are very much an entrepreneur, and someone who can grow businesses.
Speaker 2: Well, that's what I like to do.

Speaker 1: I had asked the legacy question before.  But really about Johnson Products [Company].  Now I want to ask the legacy question as it relates to you. What do you want to be your--your legacy?
Speaker 2: I really haven't thought about it. I guess I would like my legacy to be that Eric Johnson was a person who had a lot of opportunity in his life.  He was fortunate enough to be well-educated, well-exposed and he used it to make something with it.  And I think that is--if I have a legacy from the public side, that would be what I'd like people to say. On the--on the private side, I would like to be known as the best friend to my children.
Story_ID: 9098
Speaker 1: What has been really amazing about this interview and learning about your, you know, your background is, the ability to mix business and family.  And while it probably it has not been a perfect road, it's successful, and it still continues.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I mean your wife and you work together.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: You know, your brother works with you.  Those things don't happen a lot in our community.  And so I--I was wondering if you had any thoughts about why--why you, you know, why you've been successful in that way?
Speaker 2: Well, my wife [Pam Johnson] would probably tell you that I drafted her (laughs), especially as we started Baldwin Ice Cream. It was clear that I had to be the person out there developing the business and I needed someone inside that could watch all of the things and make sure that the internal part of the business was running correctly.  Because I spent a lot of time out of the office and Pam was very capable in that area.  She set up our accounting system.  She, you know, set up our original--any kind of administration.  She'd follow up on any customer complaints that ever came in.  And one of the unique things about Baldwin was when I went through the customer files prior to acquiring the company and one of the drivers for me to want to acquire the company, was that there were probably eight letters that were compliments to the product, for every two that were dissatisfied customers.  And while that is a great mix, the difference is it doesn't take any motivation for someone to complain if they feel that they've been cheated, hurt, harmed or in any way mistreated.  But it takes a lot of motivation for someone to write you a complimentary letter.  And it--it says a lot about the product that you're producing if someone takes the time to call you or write to you and say, "You know, you did a great job."  Or, "I tried your ice cream and I really loved it and keep up the good work," et cetera.  So when I saw that relationship in the ratio between the letters, I was convinced that this was a quality product.  If there's anything that's consistent about all of the businesses that I've been involved in, we've always been at the high quality end of the spectrum. I've never had a, a product that I had to sell that I had to apologize for or compare to someone else, why I'm almost as good as someone else.  And so that's a very important position for me, and it's one that I'm comfortable with, and it's one that supports the strategies that we develop.  We are a premium product company.  We develop today on the basis of taste, the best that's available to the consumer.  And in things like our ice cream, it's not rocket science.  You know, we use more cream and we use high levels of solids and we put in more nuts and/or fruit than our competitors.  So that we guarantee by the way that we construct products that we are the best in the market.
Speaker 1: And the--but your wife in your relationship.  Is it--she's an integral part of, of Baldwin Richardson [Foods Company].
Speaker 2: Yes she is.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you know, a lot of couples can't work together and live together. And your (laughs)--they can't.  And to do it successfully (laughs).  And I'm just saying what is the secret there?
Speaker 2: Boy, I tell you. That's, that's a good question.  We do it successfully.  And sometimes we're more successful than others.  You know, in the reality of it. And I think the real key is being able to build up some separation between what goes on in the office and what goes on in the home. And when we're real successful at it, then we tend to leave a lot of stuff at the office and deal with home at home.  And when we're not as successful at it, we carry it back and forth.  And, as anything else in life, you know, we work at keeping it successful.  And at the same time, I have a high level of respect for the things that Pam does and contributes into this business.  And she has a high level of respect for the things that I do and contribute to the business.  I don't want to do her job for her and she certainly has no interest in doing my job for me.  So to that extent, it's a, it's a great relationship.  Because I have somebody who I implicitly trust who is involved in a lot of the strategic areas of our business.

Speaker 1: Pam [Johnson, Johnson's wife] is a person in this business [Baldwin Richardson Foods Company] that strategically does a lot of important things.  And--her latitude within the business, being vice president of administration is broad.  And it, it works very well from a strategic standpoint within the business, and I think again having that mutual respect, we're able to maintain that also in our personal lives.  And, you know, we try to stay focused at home on children and on other things, and, and at least make sure that our lives have more than just the business in it.
Speaker 2: Now what are your hopes and aspirations for your children?  You--you have a family of four right?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Correct.
Speaker 2: And you come from a family of four.  So how--what are your--and really when you look at that whole picture--I looked at the picture back there.  It's just like it's so bountiful, you know (laughs). But I'm just wondering what your, you know, what your hopes for your family are?
Speaker 1: Well, I kind of hope that my children will do and grow and develop in the manner that--as I think back to my childhood, one of the things--my dad [George Johnson] never told me what he wanted me to do.  He never said, "You know, son, I want you to be the President of Johnson Products Company."  What he always said is, "Whatever you do, I want you to be the best at it."  And so I hope that my children are in that same--as you asked me about the legacy--that they're being well prepared, that they take what they have and they do something that they enjoy with it.  Today in my life, this is not work.  This is a, a joy.  And so when I say that it's easy to get up in the morning, it's not because, I'm, I'm worried about what's gonna happen, it's because I like doing the things that we're doing.  My children have been I think exposed to a lot of things that are preparing them for life in as fast a world as it wants to be.  I expect them to--and hope for them to be able to stay well grounded in, in the changing environment.  Other than that, today, three of them are still in school, and they're doing very well in school.  So, I often say to my wife that, you know, as we get older, what I want to do is help my children build businesses.  Now maybe they won't want to build businesses.  But that would be--to me the right finish is to watch them, help them grow businesses.  And whether they want to acquire them, you know, whatever they want to do with them. And hopefully I will have developed the kind of experiences that in passing along to them, they will be far better than I am at doing it.

Speaker 1: I want to ask you about what your feelings are about the importance of African Americans and owning their, you know, own businesses?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, I think there's, there's no questions that African Americans owning their own businesses is very important. How do you develop economy?  Well, you develop economy through equity.  You don't develop economy just through disposable income.  Because if that were true, the African American community in the United States today has the income of all but seven of the largest countries economically in the world.  So why then are our communities at such a disadvantage to the overall American society?  So not only is it important to own businesses, but it's what comes with those businesses that's important.  And what comes with those businesses are skills, jobs, not just factory jobs, not just entry level jobs, but executive jobs, that can take from and provide an opportunity for our children that are going through college.  Because we have children today going through every college in this country essentially.  And so we're coming out of law school--the top law schools, the top graduate schools, the black colleges, and we need to have within our own community ways of utilizing that talent, and ways of being able to provide careers and opportunities for those families.  The equity part is equally important because when you run and own a business, you make certain decisions.  Where will I bank?  What will I acquire in term of, I need a factory, I need land.  I need these things--that if we are aware, we should be making attempts to network with other black professionals.  When I acquired the business [Richardson Foods] from Quaker Oats [Company], obviously one of the major factors in that is a law firm.  And I went to one of the larger black law firms here in Chicago [Illinois] and had a meeting with them.  I said, "Look I know that you guys haven't historically been involved in business negotiations with 'Fortune' 100 companies.  However, we're involved in something right now, that I need to be well represented."  And I met with the head principal of the law firm and got his commitment that they could provide those services.  And they did a very excellent job for us.  And it represented for them a new opportunity, and for me, obviously it was a new opportunity.  And you know, from time to time, we have to take a chance.  We have to--you know, after all you--you do want to run your business in the best possible manner, but at the same time, you must take calculated risks to evaluate how can we bring other African American entrepreneurs and/or professionals along with us?  As we did our financing we're looking around the room, and you know, when you see these black attorneys and, and bankers.  In fact, even though they're, they're not working necessarily for black banks, but when we walk in the door as a black business, most banks that have any kind of sensitivity are gonna make sure that we get involved with some of the black officers in those banks.  And that is good because then they have experience working on deals that they might not have ordinarily gotten involved in.  We take a lot of time as we acquire and/or purchase whether it's raw materials, packaging et cetera to make certain that we are evaluating the landscape from the standpoint of African American businesses.  And that's an extra step, but a very necessary step, because it's the way that we build our economy.  So that plus, how do we fund the philanthropic and the social needs of our community?  Well if businesses were not involved in the funding of social needs, then we really wouldn't have anything. Because government clearly is not going to do that.  And African American businesses I would almost say without looking at any of their books historically have contributed far more to social causes period, and clearly far more to those which impact the African American  community than the overall business community at large.  When you look at Chicago today, African Americans employ more African Americans than any other business and/or government agency in the whole state of Illinois.  So it is a very critical part of our economic development to have African American-owned companies.
Story_ID: 9106
Speaker 1: Do you have any concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: I have a lot of concerns for the African American community. The number one concern that I have for the African American  community is that we are very quickly moving beyond the information age, into a technical era.  And whether that is driven by the Internet, which replaces a lot of sales--traditional sales jobs, we have already, mechanized manufacturing to the extent that there are not the type of factory jobs available.  So then when we look into our community and we look at substandard education that is preparing our children, particularly at the grammar school and high school level, how do we ever catch up?  And so if you look beyond that though, and you look at the overall American economy, and you look at the change in the demographics of the workforce, everybody has something at stake in this.  Because by the year 2050, if we're not utilizing the members of the African American community, they're not enough positions to continue American business.  But there doesn't seem to be that awareness of it today, because they don't feel it as strongly as they will feel it.  But you can go through any city in America today and look at fast food restaurants.  And notice how many you see that don't have help wanted signs.  How many times you see factories--you know that the "No jobs available" signs are long since gone.  But at the same time, we still have high unemployment within the African American community.  So, we need to raise the awareness within our own community and within the general community about what's at stake, if we continue to ignore this. Even areas like gang violence and, you know, overall violence within our communities, if you look at the numbers have been declining.  But despite that, if we're not able to work our way into the mainstream of the future jobs of this economy based--and the criteria there is education, then we're never going to catch up.  And in fact, we could lose ground at a faster rate than all of the progress of the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s] brought in closing that gap.  And so I think that it's, it's real critical that we begin to bring pressures to bear that says--in essence when you look at our tax base, when you look at the things that we contribute to this country, we deserve and should require much more attention to be placed on our schools, and the educational quality that we provide black children.  Because we have a lot at stake in the future of that success.
Story_ID: 9107
Speaker 1: What would be your advice to young people?
Speaker 2: Well, the number one advice to young people would be no matter what is going on in your life, probably the most important thing that leads to your future success is stay in school.  The next piece of advice would be that as young people--you know, I think a lot of times, and, and I certainly did when I was young, we think in terms of a world of young people.  And we don't necessarily think in terms of one day we're not going to be the young people, and we're gonna be in, in needs of some other things.  So, the bottom line is, we need to think more long-term.  Whatever that means.  And I think that if, if you think in terms of what did I do today that helps me become what I want to become in five years, that that kind of generates a level of focus and, and helps support drive and motivation, to make sure that you kind of stay on that track.
