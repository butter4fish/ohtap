Story_ID: 617951
Speaker 1: I'd like to start out by talking about your father.  If you could give his name and what you know about his background and his growing up?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Ernest Lamar Jakes [Ernest Jakes, Sr.].  He was born in Mississippi to Lorena Tatum Gray [Lorena Smiley Gray] and the late T.D. Jakes, so, whom I'm named after.  My father grew up in Mississippi, and met my mother [Odith Patton Jakes]--well, he was in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.  He attended Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] briefly.  He was drafted to the Cleveland Browns; ended up not finishing his degree, finally worked for Nashville Stone Setting Company.  And Nashville Stone Setting Company went on tour, building facilities and ended up building a building that is still standing, part of the state capitol [West Virginia State Capitol] in Charleston, West Virginia.  And upon the completion of that assignment, they were all packed up and ready to go.  And my mother decided she didn't want to leave West Virginia.  And as destiny would have it, that is what brought our roots from Mississippi to West Virginia.
Speaker 1: Did he talk at all about his growing up in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Quite a bit.  He is one of two children, actually three siblings.  One daughter that was adopted, and he has a brother who is yet living as of this date who is named Hoover T.C. Jakes [Hoover Jakes] and now lives in Hattiesburg, but spent quite a few years in California.  They grew up with my grandmother who was, became a widow as a result of the murder of my grandfather.  The times, of course, in Mississippi were quite racially tempestuous.  The opportunities were miniscule.  The oppression was intense.  And yet there was a camaraderie within the community that transcended all of the tragedies and adversities that surrounded living in the South during that time.  He talked about his love of sitting up under shade trees and drinking ice water (laughter), his love of going fishing in the pond in his neighborhood; the simple things of life.  That seemed to really bring camaraderie to a community that had so much to mourn about.  His mother was very, very, very strong woman, relentless woman who washed clothes for the Caucasian people in the community in a cast iron pot in front of her house, boiling the white linen and sending it out and made enough money to send herself to college and got her degree when she was fifty and taught school 'til she retired.  So that gives you some myopic understanding of what my grandmother was like.  And her infusion of tenacity affected everybody in the family, my father included.  And my father was deeply inspired by that.  That, those are some of the things that come to mind that he talked often about.
Story_ID: 617952
Speaker 1: How would you describe your father [Ernest Jakes, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: Very charismatic, extremely charismatic person, somebody that everybody liked, lots of personality.  But beneath the skin also a very pain filled individual with a lot of inner turmoil and hostility.  I think, in part, that that was brought about by the times in which he lived and the adversities that he saw every day.  And it didn't minimize it that he was raising us in the '60s [1960s].  And that, together, created quite a storm.  It wasn't like he outgrew his past or escaped it geographically.  He just ran from one hell into another.  And I think that affected him.
Story_ID: 617953
Speaker 1: Now, in his growing up, you said that it was outside of Hattiesburg [Mississippi] or Hattiesburg?
Speaker 2: It's outside of Hattiesburg.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was the name of the town?
Speaker 2: It's actually, the town is actually called Petal, Petal, Mississippi.  My father [Ernest Jakes, Sr.] met my mother [Odith Patton Jakes] as she was teaching at a school there called Springfield [Springfield High School] in Petal, Mississippi.  And my father's family were--owned quite a bit of property in Mississippi oddly enough, and mined the timber off the land.  And they were those lumberjack, hard backed, broad shouldered type black men who worked hard all week and partied all through the weekend.  And so his family, his side of the family was very fun loving, very festive.  I can remember Friday night fish fries when I was a little boy and things like that that my relatives on that side of the family would engage in.
Story_ID: 617954
Speaker 1: Now, on your mother, give her name and her--
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Odith Thelma Patton [Odith Patton Jakes].  And she is one of fourteen other siblings.  She was the youngest girl, the baby girl out of seven girls and eight brothers.  And she was born to Richard Patton and Susie Williams Patton.  And her mother was a pianist and a Sunday school teacher, and her father, I think, I think her father initially was a sharecropper and ended up owning the land that he helped to raise crops on and sent, I think twelve out of fifteen of their children to school or through college.  And they were very amazing people actually.  My mother was very proud and her family, in contrast to my father's [Ernest Jakes, Sr.] family, was much more pristine and intellectual and subdued and conservative.  Most of her sisters went to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and graduated.  The older sisters were in domestic work.  That's what they did.  That's what black women did in the times.  Her mother was a missionary.  I think an undercover preacher as it were (laughter) and a very interesting woman in her own rights.  My earliest remembrance of my grandmother would be her sitting with a blanket wrapped around her legs reading her Bible.  And she was a strong influence in that family.  My grandfather on either side died before I was born.  So I don't remember them, but I remember all the stories about them, and my mother's family was quite fascinating to me because they migrated, a lot of them toward Detroit [Michigan] during the industrial age.  And a few of them still live in Detroit.  To this day, I've got oodles of cousins on the Patton side of the family.  And a few of her sisters moved to Eufaula [Alabama] and Montgomery, Alabama and various places like that.  And she alone went to West Virginia, which was just like my mother to be radical.  And she went to West Virginia, had three children [Jakes and his siblings, Ernest Jakes, Jr. and Jacqueline Jakes].  She was the only girl on, in her family that had that many children.  Most of them only had one in contrast to the boys who had as high as ten and twelve children each.  So that, that was how she grew up.  She talked about doing her schoolwork with a lantern and she talked about the children being stacked in the bed, that there was always somebody's feet in your face because it would be--they were stacked in sardines the bed, very few bedrooms, no electric lighting, outdoor toiletry and all of that sort of thing.  And they walked miles to go to school.  She grew up in Marion, Alabama.  She went to Lincoln high school [Lincoln Normal School, Marion, Alabama].  She was a classmate of Coretta Scott at the time, who later became Coretta Scott King.  They sang in the choir together.  Lincoln high school was a high school that was started by nine slaves who met up under a tree trying to learn how to read.  And from those meager beginnings came the birthing of Lincoln high school.  And there are some interesting stories historically about the amount of professionals that came out of Lincoln high school per capita.  It's very, very fascinating and generals, some of them went to be generals.  Of course, Coretta Scott King became legendary and so many people from that, from that tree stump became people of influence and affluence, many of them educated.  Some of them had influence without intellectualism, but all of them made some sort of mark on their society.
Story_ID: 617955
Speaker 1: How would you describe your mother [Odith Patton Jakes]?  I mean you've said that, you know, her family was more pristine.  But how was she as a--how would you describe her as a person?
Speaker 2: My mother was a very strong person.  She was a very principled person.  She was very family oriented.  She was a fantastic, bionic mother (laughter).  She was quite well spoken.  She was very articulate.  She was quite intelligent.  She was a very creative person.  My mother was the kind of person who poured much of her energies into parenting her children.  She did not go to work again until I started school [at Vandalia Elementary School, South Charleston, West Virginia], and I'm the youngest sibling.  And when I started kindergarten, she started teaching kindergarten.  And when I went to first grade, she started teaching first grade, and as I grew, she grew.  And then I started--she became the state equal employment opportunities representative for the State of West Virginia.  She later went back to school to pursue a master's [degree] in learning--in teaching children with learning disabilities when she was about, I think late forties, something like that.  She was a Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.].  She was very involved in her sororities, involved in her church, but also a very private person, not nearly as charismatic as my father [Ernest Jakes, Sr.] and not nearly as outgoing and very introspective, I think, as it relates to the family.  And she taught us to village, to huddle rather.  And her words to us all of her life is no matter what happens, stick together.  And that was her final words to us when she was dying.  And oddly enough, my brother [Ernest Jakes, Jr.] and sister [Jacqueline Jakes] and I all live here in Dallas, Texas together and we are still keeping my mother's words alive to this very day.
Story_ID: 617956
Speaker 1: I wanna ask one other question.  How, you said your parents met through the school, I mean not through where she was teaching, where your--right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My, my mother [Odith Patton Jakes] was teaching school.  She was doing her student teaching at Springfield High School in Hattiesburg, Mississippi [sic. Petal, Mississippi], and she met my father [Ernest Jakes, Sr.] there.  I don't think that my father was a student there, but he lived there in Hattiesburg.  And she met him there, and that's how they met and started dating.
Speaker 1: Did they ever tell you what attracted them to each other?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's an interesting point.  My father, I'm sure, I think--this is my opinion.  I'm not sure that he would say this, but I think that my father was attracted to my mother's class.  And my mother was very classy and very graceful and a very tiny woman at the time, little, little pretty woman from Marion, Alabama.  And my father was a bit of jock.  He was kind of muscle bound and brawny and, and had a very charismatic, charming way about him.  And when they got together, the next thing you knew, my brother [Ernest Jakes, Jr.] and my sister [Jacqueline Jakes] and I were here (laughter).  And the family was birthed out of that, not in that order (laughter) (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 617957
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of growing up, Bishop Jakes [HistoryMaker Bishop T.D. Jakes]?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory of growing up would be being born and--well, I don't remember being born at Thomas Memorial Hospital [South Charleston, West Virginia], but I remember as a little boy being raised in a house that protruded off the side of a mountain in the hills of West Virginia on a street that was then called Page Street but now called Jakes Street.  Three corners of the house sat on the hill and the fourth corner protruded over the hill.  It was supported by 4 x 4 posts.  We had a floor furnace that everybody fought to stand over it in the cold of winter in West Virginia.  And I can vaguely remember my mother [Odith Patton Jakes] having chickens in the front yard, I mean just--my brother [Ernest Jakes, Jr.] and sister [Jacqueline Jakes] remember it vividly.  I remember it vaguely.  I remember a 1957 Chevy [Chevrolet] that my father [Ernest Jakes, Sr.] had in the front yard that worked briefly and, and died (laughter).  It was, I remember it vividly because it was the same year that I was born, and I can remember when they paved the street.  You know, it was originally a dirt road and they paved the street, and we thought we were, you know, cosmopolitan type people at that point.  But it was a two bedroom house with a living room and a kitchen and one bath and a half basement.  And there were three children.  And later my mother had them redo the attic and put two bedrooms upstairs.  And we migrated upstairs, and then we had a den.  It was very meager beginnings.  My father was the main breadwinner, only breadwinner.  My mother stayed at home and took care of us when we were small.  And she turned our house into a little school.  And we had to be able to read and write before we ever started school, and we had to do recitations and quote poems and all that sort of thing.  And by the time we went to school, we were on our way.  Whether we went all the way or not, we were on our way.  And later on, they bought property up the street and built up the street.  And the interstate came by, and that part of the street no longer exists today.
Speaker 1: Now, your earliest memory that you spoke of, do you know how old you might have been?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Four.
Story_ID: 617958
Speaker 1: And can you also, just for sake--'cause you're the youngest, give your siblings' names and that, you know, the difference between the ages 'cause--
Speaker 2: My oldest brother is Ernest Lamar Jakes, Jr [Ernest Jakes, Jr.].  He was born June 19th, 1950.  He actually was born in Mississippi and migrated to West Virginia.  My sister, Jacqueline Yvonne Jakes [Jacqueline Jakes] was born in 1951, December 25th.  There is a little over a year and a half difference between them.  And she's five and a half years older than me, and he's seven years older than me.  And it's just the three of us.  Incidentally, an odd fact that very few people know is that there was a child born in between my sister and I, but that child died.  And there was a child born after me named Marionette [Marionette Jakes (ph.)].  And she died.  And I was born between two dead babies.  And I think it had so much to do with the relationship that ensued between my mother [Odith Patton Jakes] and I because she was--I think she took all of her sorrow and sadness and turned it into passion and some people would say, spoiled me (laughter) consequently due to the fact that I was born in between two dead babies. I think she clung to me a little bit more tightly than she did the others having survived those traumas.
Speaker 1: And, you know, you can understand that.
Story_ID: 617959
Speaker 1: You were her little one, I bet, in many ways.  It was cute to hear you talk about, you know, you went to kindergarten, (laughter) and she went to kindergarten.
Speaker 2: Oh, we stuck together--
Speaker 1: That was nice.
Speaker 2: --all the way to the end.  I mean we were together when she died.  We were together to the last breath.  We stuck together to the end, and we had a very unique relationship that went beyond mother and son.  It--we were friends.  We were friends in a unique way that you don't see much today.  I was born as the old people would say with a veil over my face, you know.
Speaker 1: Can you, can you address that because that--I don't think people know that term as much, but it was used a lot back then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, whenever babies are born with a membrane over their face which is a very natural, medical thing that occurs from time to time, black people of that era would say the child was born with a veil over his face.  And if you were born with a veil over your face, it was an indication that you were to be prophetic in some way.  And so one of the neighbors came to my wife [Serita Jamison Jakes]--to my mother's [Odith Patton Jakes] house and knelt beside the crib and told her, said, "Oh look, God's given you a prophet.  He's been born with a veil over his face."  And oddly enough, you know, I didn't start preaching for that reason, I don't guess, but oddly enough I ended up in the ministry.  But I thought it was an odd fact that people don't talk about today.
Story_ID: 617960
Speaker 1: Now, you, let's--you were describing the house that you grew up in.  Can you describe the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Absolutely (laughter), yeah, I can see it in my mind right now.  We lived on, in an area called Vandalia [Charleston, West Virginia].  The main thoroughfare, if you were to call it that, would be Mountain Road.  It was a two lane, winding road that brought up on the mountain on one side and back down on the other side.  And there were several little alleys in between that people lived on.  And one of them was Page Street and there were several others, Clinton Road [sic. Clinton Avenue] and others.  And you'd walk around the road to the church.  It was a very close knit neighborhood.  Everybody knew everybody and everything about everybody (laughter).  And, but it was a great place to raise kids.  It really was.  There was a white side of the hill and all the white people lived on one side of the hill.  And there was, everything past the water tanks was black.  Everything on the other side of the water tanks was white.  And my brother [Ernest Jakes, Jr.] went to school during the first years of integration, and there was great conflict when he went to school.  By the time I went to school, it was a little bit more normal, and we were on the school buses.  The busing thing had existed, and we interacted with Caucasians in a way that at the time they fought more than we did.  It was, it was a very, very interesting time in the community.  Everything was very segregated and the residue still existed down to my generation.  Residuals in terms of, very seldom did you see white families migrate beyond the water tanks.  It started to happen, but not to a great degree.  And it's still largely African American today.  And gradually, some blacks would move on that side of town, but that was a slow process.  It was just an unspoken line in the sand.  But things were very simplistic.  I can remember walking around Mountain Road on Sunday mornings and hearing a lady named Mrs. Dean [ph.] singing on Sunday morning.  And it was something.  She had this amazing voice, and I would love to hear, just walk around the road and just hearing her singing.  And out of her screen door, you could hear her singing every Sunday morning.  And I ended playing the piano for the church there.  And as a little boy, at eleven years old, I was playing for the church and the choir.  And it was just interesting to experience that neighborhood.  There was a recreation center there that the kids began to play at.  There was finally some federal funding for entertainment for minority communities.  I can remember vividly big debates over, gosh, I can almost think of the name of the swimming pool.  It might have been White Rock Lake pool, I think--no, not White Rock, Rock Lake Pool [South Charleston, West Virginia], when they first allowed blacks to come in the swimming pool, and there were big fights about it and all of that.  So it was, even down there--as I think about it more and more, even down to my age, it was still some racial struggles there.  West Virginia is less than 5 percent African American even now.  So we were extremely minority.  And I can remember, I can remember when we went to Detroit [Michigan], I was just astonished to see that many black people (laughter).  I was just (laughter) was so fascinated because I grew up in an environment where I went to school around with and worked with and all I ever saw was white people.  And I was awed to be in a city where there were really that many black people.  I didn't know that many black people existed, existed, and it was just a very interesting perspective for a little boy.
Story_ID: 617961
Speaker 1: You spoke of, of a woman singing, the neighbor singing.  Can you tell me what other sights, smells and sounds remind you of your childhood?
Speaker 2: Oh, baking bread, homemade bread.  Every Sunday morning, my mother [Odith Patton Jakes] made rolls every Sunday morning.  I still have an affinity for homemade--they have to be homemade, homemade biscuits.  My mother was quite a cook, as were all the women in the neighborhood [Vandalia, Charleston, West Virginia].  And those, those were some of the smells that permeated our neighborhood.  Gardens everywhere, raising your own garden was very important; fresh vegetables in commerce.  My father [Ernest Jakes, Sr.] sold fish that came in at the train station down at the bottom of the hill.  And it would come in wood crates packed in ice.  And I can see him bringing that crate up and setting it on the front porch and we would divvy it up into newspapers.  And he had scales and he had a big red truck.  And we would go out in the neighborhood selling fish.  Everything was fresh.  Everything was out of the earth, out of the ground.  Food tasted better.  Music was more simple, less mechanical, less electronic; upright pianos everywhere, wood floors, spit shined, waxed.  (Laughter) I can remember being a little kid, putting on socks and sliding across the floor after the floor had been waxed and shined and a great deal of pride was put into how this and now in retrospect were almost worthless if you were to monetize their worth.  But there was a value that transcended money.  The smells, the sounds were those sorts of things and in contrast to that, we lived near--as industry came, a chemical plant came up.  And the chemical, the chemical plant was built near the black community.  And the downside of it was (laughter), it started producing smells you wouldn't want to smell.  The upside of it is it created jobs that we couldn't imagine having.  And I ended up working for Union Carbide [Union Carbide Corporation].  It was my father's dream to get a job at Union Carbide because they had things like benefits and credit unions and things that really affected the economy of West Virginia, along with strong coalmines.  We did not live in the coalmines.  We lived in the city.  As small as it was, it was still the, the, the capital of the State of West Virginia.  And in contrast to my wife [Serita Jamison Jakes], who is a coalminer's daughter and grew up in the coalfields of West Virginia.
Story_ID: 617962
Speaker 1: I was wondering if you were gonna talk about the coalmines, you know, but okay, you weren't---yeah, yeah, you were city people.
Speaker 2: I was, yeah, we were city people.  My, now, my wife [Serita Jamison Jakes] would be the one with the, with the coalmines.  My only stories about the coalmines would come from having pastored in the coalmines.  So I did know what it was like to drive up into the coalfields and minister up there and have church up there.  And, boy, that was an experience.  I mean country churches, unbelievable singing, great service, crisply starched white dresses, all of the women wearing white, ladies day or communion Sundays and the simplicity of the time; wood frame churches, some of them with stained glass windows, but more often than not the kinds of windows that you push up and stick something in to prop them up and let the air flow through with the Mahalia Jackson fans and Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] face on the fans that were brought over by the funeral home (laughter), with the little handle on it that looks like a popsicle stick.  I can see it vividly.  Most of them had kitchens downstairs, varnished wood steps going down into a little tiny kitchen that was always hot.  And people would cook in those kitchens.  And it was, the family was bigger than your last name.  The community was a family.  And the coalfields were very interesting because a certain sound would emit and everybody would rush to the coalmines because it meant that there had been an accident.  And whites and blacks would meet down at the bottom of the camp to see if their loved ones were safe.  It was in that environment that I pastored, and it was in that environment that I preached and sang and played the piano for a number of years.  And though I was not raised in the coalmines, I remember vividly some of the attitudes and atmospheres of the coalmines.  They'd send, they'd send their kids down to get things at the country store, and you didn't have to have any money.  They had a bill.  And when, when the coalminers got paid, you'd go up and pay the bill.
Story_ID: 617963
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your first experience at church.  Do you remember that?
Speaker 2: I cannot remember a day in my life that wasn't connected in some way to church.  And that's really funny because my parents were not deeply religious.  I mean they believed in God.  They believed--they were Christians, but they were not dogmatic by any strength of the imagination.  In contrast, they had a very practical application to their faith.  And I think at the core of my being, I have inherited that propensity to see faith in very practical terms, not, not really dogmatic, hardnosed bible thumbing, hellfire, brimstone type people.  They were not that at all.  And I can scarcely remember my father [Ernest Jakes, Sr.] in church outside of a funeral or two in my life.  He didn't have a distain for faith, but he worked all the time.  And my mother [Odith Patton Jakes] went to church, but I always got the feeling that it was in part for us (laughter), yeah, yeah, it was about us, you know, and bringing the kids to church.  And then putting them in the environment.  And then church for the black community is more than about faith.  It was the stage we were permitted on.  It was where we learned to speak.  It was where we were allowed to sing.  It was where we coalesced in times of crisis.  And so there were a whole lot of dynamics to the church that continues to be relevant to who we are today and how we see faith today.  I can remember being in a Tom Thumb wedding (laughter), and a Tom Thumb wedding is--
Speaker 1: How old were you then?
Speaker 2: Very small, like six, you know.  And Tom Thumb weddings, and you had to--they were measuring me for this tux, you know, and I can't remember who I was in the wedding.  I don't know whether I was the groom or a best man or something.  But I can remember being measured for a tux, and all the parents had all the kids out in this Tom Thumb wedding.  And so my, all of my life I've been somewhere around the church and as were most of the people in my community.  There were very few people that just flat did not go at all, even if it were once a year on Easter, but, you know, they still went.  And it was a part of who we were in a way.  It was a part of what we did, how we processed, how we grieved over the dead, how we dealt with loss, how we--it was, it was in some ways the country club of the community.  You didn't have, we didn't go to the country club.  But the church had everything that we got to go to.
Story_ID: 617964
Speaker 1: I take that back.  I don't know whether the church was the country club or the barbershop (laughter), you know, because the barbershop was really (laughter) the place where, where black men got together.  And the smell, the smell, I can still smell the smell in the barbershop my father [Ernest Jakes, Sr.] went to.  And to this day, I love the feeling of a straight razor shave, you know, and the smell of, I think it was Wildroot or something like that, that they put on you after you were shaved.  But that was where everybody talked about everything, politics and life and talked about everybody (laughter).
Speaker 2: And playing the dozens.
Speaker 1: And (laughter), exactly, exactly.  Yeah, I mean that was how it was.  And I don't remember that so much about the women because the women did their hair at home, you know, hot combs and Bergamot grease and on the back end of the stove and the smell of that burning grease and my mother [Odith Patton Jakes] pressing my sister's [Jacqueline Jakes] hair, were the times that we lived in.  Those were the days, and even the most erudite, charismatic black women had hot combs and pressed hairs.  I mean it didn't get any more than that, the early days of Mahalia Jackson was one of our superstars, but her hair was still pressed, you know.  That was, all the women wore tight little curls, you know, tight little curls, just got it done (laughter).  That, that's the world I grew up in.
Story_ID: 617965
Speaker 1: How far was your, the street you grew up in from downtown Charleston [West Virginia] and was there much exposure to downtown Charleston at that time?
Speaker 2: Not much.  You know, that was a world onto itself, and you, when you went downtown, you were really going to do business.  It wasn't that far, maybe five miles, maybe five miles.  And you would have to walk down to the bottom of the hill and catch the bus at the bottom of the hill or you could climb through a hole in the fence and walk across the railroad tracks which was amazingly dangerous in retrospect, but that was how we did it, and walk across to the Westside [Charleston, West Virginia], across a bridge and catch another type bus to get uptown.  And I have walked uptown as I got older.  And we didn't really see ourselves as city people, just, just people.  We didn't see ourselves any different from the people who lived in the coalmines.  We just lived in a different part of town, and that was how it was.
Story_ID: 617966
Speaker 1: Tell me what you were like as a young boy.  Like, I'm looking at around the age of maybe eight--eight, nine, ten.  What were you like?  And, you know, were you--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --rambunctious were you--you know, you had said, someone said you were spoiled.  You know, maybe you were a mama's boy.  But what things, you know, 'cause we're starting to form at that age.
Speaker 2: Okay, I was very entrepreneurial.  I can tell you that for sure.  I had a strong business mind at a very early age.  As far back as I can remember, I approached the community doing business.  My mother [Odith Patton Jakes] would raise greens out the garden, and I would put them in bags and sell them in the neighborhood and give people a receipt.  And I was about that small.  I passed out newspapers and sold Grit magazines and opened up a bank account at that age.  My mother encouraged us to think smart and think ahead and save and invest and by the time, gosh, by the time I was like twelve or so, I had saved up a considerable amount of money, maybe three hundred dollars, which back then was like a huge amount of money for a little kid.  But I was handy, and anytime anybody needed anything done, I would do it, whether it was cutting grass or passing newspapers.  I was busy, busy, trying to move things ahead.

Speaker 1: What about school?  How, what was school like for you, and, and you know, I had read about you having a lisp, you know, I mean which--so was that something you were aware of as a young person or you got teased about or--
Speaker 2: It never really bothered me.  First of all, I didn't know that I had it until they said that I did (laughter), okay.  So I couldn't hear it myself.  And it never really bothered me, and the children never really teased me about it.  It was more of an issue to the teachers than it was for me.  And I can remember them bringing a speech therapist to talk to me and to work with me just a little bit and a few occasions that they did.  But I didn't come home like distraught or anything like that.  My mother [Odith Patton Jakes] made sure that you had strong self esteem.  Yeah, so we were never (laughter), we were never at risk of being intimidated by what other people said because she pretty much fixed you before she opened up that front gate.  And when she opened up that front gate, it was gonna be what she said about it.  And it never bothered me.  So I went to school, and whatever they said I needed to work on, I tried to work on it.  But I never felt vulnerable.
Speaker 1: So what was your elementary, what was the name of the elementary school?
Speaker 2: Vandalia Elementary School [South Charleston, West Virginia].
Speaker 1: Van Day?
Speaker 2: That's the first one, that was the first one.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Vandalia.
Speaker 1: Okay, V-A-N-D-A-L-I-A?
Speaker 2: That's exactly right, elementary school.  And then later, when they tore it down, Weberwood Elementary School [Charleston, South Carolina] which was way on the other side of the town, and you had to bus over there into the white neighborhood to go to school over there.
Story_ID: 617968
Speaker 1: Yeah, I keep thinking 'cause you're really, let's see, I'm fifty-three so I'm fifty--I'm three years older than you, but so, 'cause around that time there were a lot of things happening in the '60s [1960s], you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and your--so, are your parents talking about this, you know, what's going on 'cause remember you said your father [Ernest Jakes, Sr.] had a lot of anger, you know, that--or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but my father had a lot of anger, but I don't think it was the kind of anger that would make you carry signs or burn down buildings.  It, it, it was in some ways more destructive than that.  I think it was more internal rage, suppressed rage that men often have.
Speaker 1: Because he couldn't, I mean just black men had to fight for their manhood--
Speaker 2: They had to fight for everything.
Speaker 1: --every day.
Speaker 2: Every day of their lives, and never be compensated and called boys every day, and laughed at, jeered at, mistreated and belittled in a way that was degrading.  And so that was an interesting time in the world, but I can remember when John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was killed, assassinated.  I can remember when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] died, and the whole, all the air sucked out of the room.  And I can remember everybody that I knew crying about it and me, watching it on television on a television screen that was probably about that--the glass was about that thick, you know.  And it looked like a bifocal, and I can see the television set now and everybody in every house glued to it.  You could see what everybody was doing in the house 'cause everybody's door was open and very few people had screen doors.  And they had television sets with rabbit ears on 'em and aluminum foil at the top of the ears and everybody was moving the ears so they could get the best reception to hear what was going on.  Boy, when I hear myself say that, it makes me sound so old (laughter), but that's the world that I grew up in.  And I as very, very young, but I knew that something important had happened, and there was quite a bit of talk about that sort of thing going on at the time, and especially since my father was from Mississippi and my mother [Odith Patton Jakes] was from Alabama.  And whenever Mrs. King would get to town, my mother would go out to see her, and there were all the stories about how they grew up and the neighborhood that they grew up in.  And Mama would talk about how Coretta [Coretta Scott King] could sing.  "Oh, Coretta could sing."  And she did.  A lot of people don't know this, she had a voice like a mockingbird.  But, yeah, I remember vividly those times.
Story_ID: 617969
Speaker 1: There was a story that said that you were called the bible boy.
Speaker 2: Much older.
Speaker 1: Much--oh, that's much older (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's like high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's not go there then.  What about your father [Ernest Jakes, Sr.] being diagnosed with kidney disease?  Was that--I have it in, in my outline that it occurred at age ten.  Is that--
Speaker 2: About ten.  I was just thinking about that in my mind, about ten.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He died when I was sixteen.
Speaker 1: Right, so, so what do you remember, what--do you remember the whole discussion of him, you know, becoming sick--
Speaker 2: Everything about it.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: First, renal failure was something that there was very little information about and access to dialysis equipment was very rare at that time, especially for the part of West Virginia that I lived in.  Secondly, my father had just made it, you know.  We were there, and we were buying property and we were on our way up and--
Speaker 1: Now, let's talk about that.  What was he, you know, how had he--
Speaker 2: I mean he started a business with a mop and a bucket and ended up with fifty-two employees.  He had trucks with his janitorial service brand on them going all over the State of West Virginia.  And we were making money.  And my mother [Odith Patton Jakes] had gone to work and the kids were getting older, and we were buying property everywhere.  And we had owned quite a bit of real estate that we were going, there, you know.  It was--and then, and my father was big and he was thick.  He was a real big robust guy and never went to the doctor or that sort of thing and became hypertensive, and didn't know it and was about to get hired on at Union Carbide [Union Carbide Corporation], incidentally, to do some work for Union Carbide when they did a physical on him and found out his blood pressure was so high.  And his blood pressure was so high that if I'm not mistaken, it was something like 270/240, something like that, you know.  It was really high.  And it had damaged his kidneys.  His kidneys shut down.  They treated him for weeks and weeks for the wrong thing.  And there was nothing wrong with his heart, and they were treating his heart.  And it was really, he was hypertensive, and then by the time, they figured out that, his kidneys were shutting down.  And if he did not get dialysis, he was going to die.  And there was no dialysis unit in Charleston [West Virginia] at the time.  So we had to drive from Charleston to Cleveland [Ohio] which was almost four and a half hours away, twice a week for him to be dialyzed before he died.  I remember all of it vividly, like it was yesterday.  My mother had a job with great benefits, and they were working through the process of trying to get us a kidney machine in the house, but in the meantime, every week of my life, either all of us or my mother and father drove to Cleveland to go through dialysis.  And he was, he went through the diagnostic program at the Cleveland Clinic [Cleveland, Ohio].  And I can remember being up there for weeks and weeks at a time.  And I can remember little kids who did not have good medical insurance, so my parents said did not get dialysis.  And I watched them turn, their skin turned yellow and them die.  I was very afraid.
Story_ID: 617970
Speaker 1: My father [Ernest Jakes, Sr.] went from being about 280 pounds to 130 pounds.  I can remember my sister [Jacqueline Jakes] who had moved to, to Washington, D.C. at the time, came home and saw my father for the first time and burst into tears in the door.  And my mother [Odith Patton Jakes] wasn't given to a lot of emotions so we were not allowed to like really fall apart.  And Mama said, "Oh, girl, pull yourself together."  But she said, "Oh, Mama, look at Daddy."  And he was so skinny, and he was shaking and frail and stuff like that, very emotional time.  I can remember us finally getting the dialysis machine, and my mother and I both being trained about it.  And the very first time I was ever, ever in the newspaper in my life it was looking up at a bottle of saline attached to the kidney machine and my mother is in the shot, my father is in the shot and I was in the shot.  And I have that clipping somewhere.  And that was the very first time I was ever in the newspaper in my life.  And so we had the dialysis machine now in the basement of the house, which stopped us from going back and forth to the hospital [Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio].  I, and if I was not on the road with them, then I had to be responsible.  I was the last sibling at home, cut off the lights, lock the house, cook for yourself, take care of yourself, get yourself out to school, do what you got to do.  And then when we got it home, my mother was working, but twice a week, eight hours a day in the evenings, he was being dialyzed.  And if something happened in the machine, or it backed where there was a problem--I can remember blood being over the floor and having to mop the blood up off the floor as a little child.  I can remember that was one of the jobs that I had to do.
Speaker 2: So how did this affect the family--
Speaker 1: Oh (laughter)--
Speaker 2: --because, you know, when something like that, when there's illness and it's prolonged, you know--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, I think it affected the family drastically.
Speaker 2: --and your child's, you know, and even the childhood.
Speaker 1: Oh, I had no childhood, absolutely.  None at all, none.  I can't even relate to it, even to this day.  And it was difficult to raise children because it's hard to give people what you didn't get.  But it was, it affected the family in drastic ways.  It became the centerpiece on the table of family life.  It was all about the sickness.  Everything is about the sickness.  All roads led to what day dialysis was and whether we were traveling or whether we were doing it downstairs.  It affected absolutely everything.  And it was just my mother and my father and I.  My brother [Ernest Jakes, Jr.] had moved to California, and my sister lived in Washington.  And so it devastated his business.  I held on to it as best I could for a while.  I would catch the bus and go downtown [Charleston, West Virginia] and lock up the various offices that were being cleaned and make payroll.  But by that time, I was like maybe thirteen or so.
Speaker 2: So that's like maybe 1970? Seventy [1970] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, yeah, (unclear) yeah, yeah, about 1970.  And those were very difficult times, indeed.
Story_ID: 617971
Speaker 1: All of a sudden they have to be the man of the family.  And in many ways, also which strikes me is that you're, you are almost an only--you know, because of the age gap, you're almost an only child.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Absolutely, absolutely, very much so.  And there was, there was an expectation of me that you stand up to this.  And I have to do this, and you have to do this, and I'm gonna give you this alarm clock.  You set this alarm clock, get up in the morning, and do this, get your lunch money, walk to the top of the road and go to school.  And when you get home, you shut the doors down in the evening, so and so and so.  And I'll be home in the morning because she'd be driving back and forth.  So I ended up spending the night in the house by myself as a kid and getting myself up to school in the morning because she [Jakes' mother, Odith Patton Jakes] tried letting me stay with the neighbors.  It didn't work.  It just didn't work, and I was better by myself (laughter), yeah, I was better.  So, you know, it was a very interesting way to grow up, that's for sure.  And it ate my father [Ernest Jakes, Sr.] alive to not be able to do and to take care and move and do.  And then he was frail and willowy and weak.  I mean this is a guy that I've seen pick up the back end of a car and set it on the road when it slid off the road in the snow.  He was strong as an ox.  And all of a sudden, he's shaking and trembling and I can still see how he crossed his legs because when you're a big guy, you can only cross your legs so far.  But when you're really small, I mean really under 130 small, 130 pounds, he could cross his legs all the way over and his other leg would be dangling there.  And he'd just be kicking it.  And I can remember thinking, wow, look at Daddy. Look at Dad.
Story_ID: 617972
Speaker 1: What about your mother [Odith Patton Jakes]?  How is she handling, I mean does, you know (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, my mother, my mother was, I, I almost said military.  My mother is strong as an ox.  I've only seen my mother cry three times in my whole life.  My mother, my mother faced challenges with tenacity and drive and commitment.  And she's told us, "He [Jakes' father, Ernest Jakes, Sr.] took care of us when he was well, and we're gonna take care of him," and that was that.  And she seldom complained about it, and taking care of sick people is not easy because they were not always nice (laughter).  They're not always appreciative or anything.  But my mother was almost military, and she worked in between, and she did the best she could with what life handed her.  And we made it, and I learned how to cook, and I learned how to hem my own pants, and I learned how to take care of myself.  There was no room in our lives for frivolity or foolishness.  And at the core of my siblings [Ernest Jakes, Jr. and Jacqueline Jakes] and myself, there is something rock hard, that if you dig us down past personality and smiling and joking, there's something down in us that's as relentless and tenacious as they come because there was no room for anything else.  You were not allowed, my--I mean falling apart was not in my--if you fell apart on my mother, she would slap you right in the face, just right in the face.  I mean, immediately.  You wouldn't even know where her hand came from.  And she would say, "You get yourself together."  And here, she wasn't mean, but she was strong.  And I'm glad.  I'm really glad because for what life hands you, if you're not strong, you won't make it.  And I understand her better with every passing day, you know, that you--that falling apart is a luxury that we could not afford.  And I clearly get it.  And I'm very similar deep down inside to how she was, yeah.  That was how we grew up and he--and then their marriage finally just fell apart to absolutely nothing, and they separated right down at the end.  And shortly thereafter, he died.  He married again in Mississippi for a brief little while, and then he died and we all went to the funeral, and--
Speaker 1: So, he actually married again?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Even when he was ill like that.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Probably just to show her (laughter), that he could, you know.  And I don't know that he lived a year because the kind of care that he got, he couldn't get that anywhere else.
Speaker 1: It wasn't your mother's care, right.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  No, my mother had magic in her for taking care of you.  She always seemed to know what to give you no matter what was wrong with you.  And she just, she just had a way about her that he, right away from her, he went down pretty quickly.
Story_ID: 617973
Speaker 1: And we all went to the funeral.  And I can remember being at East Pine A.M.E. Church in Hattiesburg, Mississippi [sic. Petal, Mississippi] with the late Reverend Mott [ph.] officiating the funeral.  And I'm now sixteen years old, sitting in the funeral with my mother [Odith Patton Jakes] and my brother [Ernest Jakes, Jr.] and my siblings and my aunt from Alabama who came down to support my mother and my [paternal] grandmother [Lorena Smiley Gray] and his new wife and her little boy, all on the front two rows (laughter).  I remember it like it was yesterday, yeah.  And, in fact, they wanted me to sing 'Precious Lord' ['Take My Hand, Precious Lord'] because I had sung 'Precious Lord' in the hospital to him when he was dying, and I couldn't do a very good job with it, but I remember it very, very well, very well.
Speaker 2: You couldn't do a good job because you were emotional, is that it?
Speaker 1: Extremely emotional.  I was like a wreck.  You know, I was just an absolute wreck.  I thought it was the most horrible thing I had ever seen in my life, and it was.  It was because you have to understand my whole life was defined by his illness and his survival, and for him to be dead meant that everything that I had lived for had now failed.  So it wasn't just that I lost a father.  I lost the fight.  And that was like traumatic to me, you know.  I remember it very, very well.  And all of my father's people are buried in a place called Montrose, Mississippi on the side of a hill.  It's not really a cemetery.  It's like a family plot, and some of the graves are caving in and all that kind of stuff.  But for generations, back to my great-great-grandfather's mother, who was a slave, they're all buried up there because from the moment my people were cut loose from slavery, they started owning their own land and mining timber up there on them hills.  And that, that was where my father [Ernest Jakes, Sr.] wanted to be buried, and everybody knew that (laughter).  And that's--even though it took like two hours to get from the church to the cemetery where they buried him, that's where he's buried right now.  Yeah, I remember it like it was yesterday.  And I was, at the same age my youngest son [Thomas Dexter Jakes] is now, that's how old I was when my father died.
Speaker 2: So you--you're sixteen when he passes (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 617974
Speaker 1: So between the ages of sixteen and nineteen, what is happening?  Are you, do you get--'cause we went back to this whole thing of why they call you the bible boy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, the, the bible boy comes out of the death because out of the death comes the search for something to fill the void because the father is gone, the fight is gone, and the son is confused.  So, this insatiable desire for church and God and all of that is in part provoked not only, as I believe, from destiny but in part provoked from the fact that there is this intense craving desire to find out, to make some sense of all this.  This is stupid (laughter), you know, to suddenly figure out what is life all about.  My father [Ernest Jakes, Sr.] told me by the time he figured out what life was all about, it was time to go.  And I thought, oh, I'd better hurry because if I don't hurry, I won't figure this out.  And if he died at forty-eight, I probably will, too.  So I'd better get to stepping and so that led me to the Jesus movement and even though I had church experience in my past  that caused me to take it more seriously.  And then I got involved with Pentecostals and the Charismatic Movement and all of that.  And--
Speaker 1: This is all in Charleston [West Virginia] though, right?
Speaker 2: This is all in Charleston and it is all in my late teens.  And I'm in the church and out the church and in the club (laughter) and back in the church and in the street and in the church and the search is on.  The search is on to find something stable to which I could anchor myself to.  And then you have to add to that, that not too long after that my mother [Odith Patton Jakes] had, they found all of these fibroid tumors in her stomach and they'd done the surgery on her.  And I thought she was going to die.  And it really wasn't as serious, but back then, those surgeries were pretty rough.  And I thought she was gonna die, and I'd already lost one parent.  And I panicked.  I stopped everything.  I came home from school.  I wouldn't go to school.  I wouldn't leave her bed.  I remember being a little boy walking down the hallway begging God not to take her too because I wouldn't have anybody.  My brother [Ernest Jakes, Jr.] was in California.  My sister [Jacqueline Jakes] was in D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  My father is dead.  She was all I had left.  And so it was a very tempestuous time for me, and out of that I think the caverns and crevices and caves that they created in the depths of my being became cisterns to which the water of life and the feeling of faith began to fill those voids.  And much of that billows out of me now billows from those caves and caverns.  That, that was where the artesian well sprung from.  People saw the water come up, but they didn't know where it came from.
Story_ID: 617975
Speaker 1: So how did you know--now, let me ask was it Bobbie Tolliver that--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --can you tell, tell his role in this--
Speaker 2: It's a she.
Speaker 1: She, oh, I'm sorry, she, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, she was a neighbor.  And she had a--
Speaker 1: Oh, Lord, okay, what--okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): I'm making sure that your jacket was (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay, sorry.
Speaker 2: Bobbie Tolliver who has been made famous because of me (laughter) was my next door neighbor.  Her husband recently passed away.  And their son [Wyatt Tolliver] was my next door neighbor and we grew up as best friends as little kids.  And she lived next to me.  She was a school teacher, and she was part of the Hutcheson [ph.] family.  And they had like a gazillion brothers and sisters.  And, and she married a Tolliver and they had a gazillion brothers and sisters.  And so their family was interconnected in a very strong way in our church and in our community and everything around us.
Story_ID: 617976
Speaker 1: So when do you really take to preaching and who is, who's mentoring you on that?  When, when is, you know, when was your, like, you know, it says that you preached your first sermon at age nineteen.  But what church was that in?
Speaker 2: It was in Greater Emmanuel Apostolic Faith Tabernacle [Greater Emmanuel Gospel Tabernacle] on the corner of 3rd [Avenue] and Stockton [Stockton Street, Charleston, West Virginia].  I had left the Baptist church and--
Speaker 1: Now, why?
Speaker 2: The Baptist people were not too excited about me fooling around with those Pentecostal folks, and I was given an ultimatum.  You know--
Speaker 1: That you had to do one or the other?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you had to do one or the other, and you couldn't profess a Pentecostal experience in the Baptist church at that time.  And I think, and I was the choir director so I had a lot of influence over a lot of people.  And they were very, very afraid about that.  And so I left (laughter), I left and went over there with that, in that little Sanctified church and started playing the piano and singing and (laughter) I was bootleg preaching.  I wasn't really preaching.  And they'd have testimony service, and then we'd, bootleg preaching, just (unclear) speak to man.  And I just had this inclination to do it and an embarrassment behind it too because I would do it and then, then feel embarrassed about it because I was afraid of it.  It was kind of like a moth in the flame sort of thing.  And then I acknowledged my calling at seventeen.  I actually accepted it and started preaching at nineteen.  And from nineteen to now, I've never stopped preaching.  From seventeen to nineteen, I was like running and running away from it and that sort of thing.  But from nineteen to now, I've always had some involvement with teaching or preaching or studying the Bible and was just fascinated by it, insatiably so.  It thought it was--I could understand it.  It made sense.  I could read it and see pictures.  I could read it and it was like a movie.  I could read it and I felt like I knew the characters.  I could feel what they meant when they said what they said.  When David bows over his son Absalom and says, "Oh, Absalom, Absalom, my son is dead" [2 Samuel 18:33]. It was like drama.  It was stage.  And I think because I read it like that, it's not a leap for me to be in films and things like that because to me the Bible is quite theatrical.  It's, it's, it's quite dramatic.
Story_ID: 617977
Speaker 1: But how did you know that you had a gift in the pulpit?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: That's what I mean.  That's, it's a different thing to be reading it and seeing it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's a different thing, 'cause those in the pulpit influence others.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm not sure that I did know that I had a gift in the pulpit.  I knew that I had a calling all my life, but I never thought I was a good preacher.  I just--no, I never thought that.  I just was gonna throw everything I had in it, but I never thought I had gift at it.  And people (laughter), didn't respond initially like I did either (laughter).  They pretty much--there was kind of an indifference about it.  I mean my mother [Odith Patton Jakes] thought I was wonderful (laughter).  My mother thought I was wonderful, but initially, I mean it was hard to break through to the point that they had any appreciation for your skill set.  So I never assumed that I was any good, and that--but that was good.  That was good because that made me go home and study harder and work harder and try harder.  I didn't get the free pass that people get today.
Speaker 1: Well, you also are speaking to the structure of any church?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: You know, there's a (unclear), so you have to sort of pay your dues no matter what the--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, and I did for years and years and years.  And when I finally started pastoring at twenty-two years old, I was sent to a building, given a month's worth of rent and the deposit and told, "God bless you."  And it was sink or swim.  There were--they, there was nothing to sustain you, nothing to keep you going for you or the church.  You had to get out there and create a budget, create financing, develop programming and get some members, and they had no choir.  And you had to get the equipment and everything with absolutely nothing.  But that's when all those years of watching my dad [Ernest Jakes, Sr.] with that mop and that bucket joined together with that Bible (laughter), and those two concepts fused together in my head.  And I started saying to myself, I will survive.  And I did.  And I did.  And there are tremors of that union in my life even to this day.  There's a propensity both to the business and to the Bible, even to this day.  But that's where the intersection met, right there at the point of that need in a place called Montgomery, West Virginia [at Greater Emmanuel Temple of Faith] where I went at twenty-two years old into an empty building and couldn't afford to even paint the inside of the building.  I bought--I sold chicken dinners to raise money to buy paint.  And we bought this discontinued paint from Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] at twenty-five cents a can.  It was all different colors and mixed it together in a garbage can on the front porch of my house and then poured it back in the cans and carried it all the way up to Montgomery and painted the room one color.  That's how we started with nothing.  I mean absolutely nothing at all but shear grit and will and my mother's tenacious voice in my head saying, "Pull yourself together, you can do this."
Story_ID: 617978
Speaker 1: Had you met your wife [Serita Jamison Jakes] at this time?
Speaker 2: Not at first (simultaneous).

Speaker 2: He was our presiding bishop.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And later he would be the one that ordained me as a bishop in their organization, many years later.
Speaker 1: So can you just quickly describe the structure of the church, you know, there.  I mean just--okay.
Speaker 2: They--I grew up attending the church.  After I left the Baptist church, I attended, the church that I attended was a part of his fellowship of churches.  He was the presiding bishop.  There were diocese bishops and diocese bishops were bishops who had jurisdiction over different geographical locations.  And those diocese bishops reported to the general bishop.  And from the diocese bishops were presiding elders and from the presiding elders were pastors and from the pastors were members.  So that was the structure of the church.  And for, if you were interested in becoming a minister, you had to spend at least one year on trial and with the recommendation of your pastor and your church in good standing, you can go before the board for examination.  And if you passed the examination at a certain percentile, you would be licensed for a minimum of two years and function as a licensed minister and continue to study and go back before the bishops with a more detailed test and go up for ordination.  And I did all of that, and I was ordained a minister in their denomination.  Now, from there to the bishop--
Speaker 1: Now, how long did it take you to become ordained?
Speaker 2: Three and a half years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And from there to the bishopry was something that, there was no real path.  It was just, if they thought you had it or they wanted to appoint you or you were recommended, that's how you got there.  And, and I was eventually, and I became the diocese bishop over the State of West Virginia at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 617979
Speaker 1: So that's when, so at that point, you start in Montgomery [West Virginia] at, you know, your church [Greater Emmanuel Temple of Faith] in Montgomery.  Now, how long are you in that church and how--what is the membership of the church, of your early church?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, initially there were no members at all.  I think the first Sunday I had service, maybe seven people came, okay.  And I was very, very happy to see them, yeah, 'cause I had been running a revival, and there was nobody there at all, except this alcoholic who came in one night, and I laid hands on him.  It was about seven people and later, maybe about forty people.  At the point I got up to forty people I was really doing good.  And I saw a building in Smithers [West Virginia] which was a neighboring area, and it was a condemned theater.  And I wanted--this building I was in, in Montgomery, I was renting.  I wanted to own that building.  So I went to Montgomery National Bank [Montgomery, West Virginia] and carried three years of financial statements that I sat at the dining room table going through old check stubs putting together and balancing it out and putting it all together by myself, and my wife [Serita Jamison Jakes] then.  And we--they loaned us the money to buy this building which was, they loaned us thirty-six thousand dollars to buy this building.  And there hadn't been anybody in this building for about thirty years.  It was a condemned building, and I needed far more to do anything, but I didn't know what I was doing.  And I couldn't have got the money anyway.  So I got enough money to buy the building, but then I had to put a roof on the building and I had to put in plumbing and wiring and all that.  There were trees growing in the building and rats everywhere.  But I was happy as I could be.  I was excited 'cause it was gonna be a church, and it was and it is.  It still is today.  But I went in there and gutted that place and cleaned it up and made it a church and started developing the church and the membership grew.
Speaker 1: And what did it grow to?
Speaker 2: I would say like maybe about a hundred or so, maybe 100, maybe a hundred faithful members.  We might have had two hundred on the rolls but we only saw about a hundred.  And when we'd have major events, I guess about, maybe 150, 200 people would pack the place up, yeah.  And I stayed in that area for ten years.
Speaker 1: So that's like 1980 to maybe 1990, sort of, or?
Speaker 2: I would think so.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right along in there.
Story_ID: 617980
Speaker 1: And then I moved to Charleston [West Virginia].  And I moved to Charleston because I was drawing more people from Charleston who drove like maybe an hour away than I was drawing out of the community I was in [Montgomery, West Virginia].  I thought, the tail is wagging the dog and you're getting older, and you need to make a move.  And I made that switch and went to Charleston and started preaching in South Charleston [West Virginia], actually, across from the Row City Cafeteria, the little building there.  And when I came there, that's when I did the Sunday school class called Woman, Thou Art Loosed! and about forty-six women in the Sunday school class, and I didn't finish that Sunday and I carried--I didn't finish that Sunday and I carried it over a second week and twice as many women came.  (Laughter) So after twice as many women came, I didn't wanna finish.  I said (laughter), "Let me (unclear)." (Laughter) 'Cause this is going somewhere.  And after a while there were women standing outside to hear me talk about this Woman, Thou Art Loosed!  I didn't even call it that at the time.  I didn't even have a name for it.
Speaker 2: That's what I'm wondering.  How did it, how did it even come to you to do this or to speak--I mean I'm just--
Speaker 1: It was inspired because I counseled women who had secrets and suffered with secrets that I wanted to help.  I related to their pain.  I related to their suffering, and I thought there are biblical answers that would help you with this and I wanted to share it.  And I thought if I brought them all together in one place and I started teaching on this, maybe I could really make a difference.  And it was, it was amazing because I did it for about four weeks, and it was crazy.  And I had these tapes, and I developed these tapes.  And I called a friend of mine named Archie Dennis [Archie L. Dennis, Jr.] who lived in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], and I told--actually, in Monroeville, Pennsylvania at the time, and I told Archie, I said, "Archie, I'm teaching this class for women and they're going nuts about this class."  And he said, "Oh, tell me about it."  So we're on the phone and I'm preaching all this stuff to him over the phone.  And he said, "Well, you need to come up here and share that."  And I said, "Really?"  And I said, I said, you know, "I'll come."  So I said--he said, "So what are you gonna call it?"  I said, "I don't know."  I said, "Let's call it Woman, Thou Art Loosed! 'cause that's what the Bible said, 'Woman, thou art loosed [Luke 13:12].'  Let's just call it that."  And he said, "Okay."  So he did it, and he advertised it and so many women signed up he had to move it from his church to the hotel.  And I went there, and, and taught on it and got four more tapes.  Now, I had eight tapes to the series.  Next thing I know, somebody was talking to me about doing a book.  So they took all my tapes and they transcribed them and tried to make a book of it, but I hated it because between what the author was writing and you speak differently than you write.  So it doesn't sound good when you write it.  And then by the time he was rounding it off, it was like, "What women ought to do is, you know," and, "what's wrong with women today."  And I thought, none of this, it's not in the spiritual.  I went in there to try to fix it and ended up rewriting it all together to protect the brand of what I wanted to say.  And then I couldn't get anybody to publish it.  They wanted me to pay to publish it ['Woman, Thou Art Loosed!,' T.D. Jakes].  And I almost walked away from it because it was gonna cost fifteen thousand dollars to publish it.  And that was all the money we had in the world.  And we were trying to get a house.  There wasn't church money.  That's my money (laughter).  And we were trying to get a house, but my wife [Serita Jamison Jakes] and I talked about it, and, and I did it.  I went ahead and put the money into it, and the book exploded.  I've never had a book ever do any better.  And the rest was history.
Story_ID: 617981
Speaker 1: It was during that same period, incidentally, that I spoke at Azusa.  And it was during that same period that Paul Crouch heard a tape, a seven minute clip of me speaking for Carlton Pearson and invited me to be a guest on TBN [Trinity Broadcasting Network] and invited me to do my own TV show ['Get Ready with T.D. Jakes'].  And I got on television on TBN for two years and never owned a camera.  I didn't have any staff.  I didn't have a big church.  I didn't have anything, just tenacious.
Speaker 2: So you're at, you're still in South Charleston [West Virginia]?
Speaker 1: I'm still in South Charleston (laughter)--
Speaker 2: --doing it.
Speaker 1: --yeah, in a church that would seat maybe, maybe 250, maybe 250, maybe 250 small built people.
Speaker 2: But that's an amazing story when you think about it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean it really is.
Speaker 1: I had no money.  I had no background.  I had no mentoring of anybody who'd ever been on TV.  I'd never belonged to a big church.  I'd never been up under anybody who was on TV right up to our presiding bishop, wasn't on TV.  I knew nothing about it.  And we had eight thousand dollars in the church account when we got on television.  That's all we had.  And it was December.  It was like the worse time of year to go on television, and yet that was when the door opened, and I got on television like that.  And that's where I started.
Speaker 2: And just--now, how did that happen with you getting on television in that way because, I mean that, even that to fall in because everybody wants to be on television, but to be on TBN is a whole different--
Speaker 1: It's a waiting line.
Speaker 2: --that's a whole different (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's a waiting line.  It was just God's favor I think because truth be told, I was preaching a message at Carlton Pearson's church that Paul Crouch said he really needed to hear.  And when he heard the message, it really touched his life, and he wanted me on television.  It wasn't--I never asked to be on television.  They asked me.  I never wrote the letters requesting it.  It was something that happened to me.  And all of a sudden I'm in this great big ol' world and bear in mind, I'm from West Virginia and been pastoring like seven people, and then forty and like that.  I'm in this big, ol' world and I'm being whisked into all these big churches, and I'm speaking in all these places.  And I don't even know how to do any of this stuff.  And I'm learning as I go.  That was how it was.  And it was a, it was an amazing journey.  It was a, whew, it was an amazing journey that, that was, kept getting faster and faster and faster.
Story_ID: 617982
Speaker 1: 'Cause this is like 1993 when you publish ['Woman, Thou Art Loosed!,' T.D. Jakes]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and I think the deal with TBN [Trinity Broadcasting Network] came--did it come the same year, or, or (?
Speaker 2: About the same time.  I'm not exactly sure, but not too far--
Speaker 1: Okay, it may have come a little after?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, after that.  Now, did you--you know, I just don't wanna--you had been married at this point, how many, about ten or eleven, twelve--let me see.  You had been married 'cause--give your wife's name.
Speaker 2: I got married in '82 [1982].  My wife's name is Serita, S-E-R-I-T-A [Serita Jamison Jakes].  I got married in '82 [1982] so you say this is '90 [1990], so ten, twelve years.  And this doesn't even touch the fact that while all of that was going on, we--
Speaker 1: You're having children.
Speaker 2: -- we're having children. And she was in a bad car wreck.  She almost lost the use of her leg.  They said she'd never walk again.  I mean it was drama on one side and ministry on the other and that, all of that was--those were the times.  I mean it was, our whole life has always been drama (laughter).  We were, we were, you know, the best and worst of times all the time.  That's, and I think, to me, that's how life is, period, for everybody, that you don't get to have just all ice cream, and you don't get to have all trouble, that it's some strange montage of all of it at the same time.
Story_ID: 617983
Speaker 1: Though in this whole focus really on women who, really it's--it almost, touched a chord with a lot of women--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but the target in the beginning were women that had, you know, these, you know, troubled times that may have come out of rape.  It may have come out of incest.  It was, you know, you can be--I mean I'd like you to talk about, you know, what's the whole--
Speaker 2: Woman--Woman, Thou Art Loosed! is about the times in which it came.  I think if I said it all today, it would not be nearly of impactful as it was at that moment right there because there weren't any, there weren't any men legitimizing the authenticity of female pain.  It just was not done.  And even though women dominated the congregations, they had very little voice.  And I got it.  I heard 'em and I got it.  And I understood it.  And I understood where pain comes from 'cause bear in mind, I've got all these holes in me.  So I connected with them.  I understood them and I thought, you know, I'm gonna say something (laughter), and I did.  And I was scared to death because I didn't wanna put myself on front street either, and all of a sudden I'm out there.  And, you're right.  It was amazing.  It, the book's been translated into several different languages.  It's gone around the world.  I've been invited, I was invited to Nigeria to share it.  I've gone into Caucasian, blacks, and Hispanics.  It doesn't matter.  It resonated and still is relevant today, but was extremely relevant at the time to the point that intellectual women would meet who, had no faith background at all and say, "You know, I read your book and I, oh, you know, it spoke to me in such a significant way."  (Laughter) And I didn't know anything about writing a book.  (Laughter) I'd never written a book before.  I didn't even know what a word processor was.  I wrote the book in the notepad of a PC Study Bible.  I didn't even know what a word processor was.  But I was trying to say that you can make it no matter how bad life has been to you, that you can survive the trouble, the atrocities, the vicissitudes of life.  And I wanted to say that because that was me, too (laughter), you know.  It wasn't just a female thing.  That was me too.  And it was my mother [Odith Patton Jakes].  It was my mother too, and my father [Ernest Jakes, Sr.] screaming in her ear while she was driving him to Cleveland [Ohio].  It was everything that I had ever experienced and I meant it with every fiber in me.  I was, I find myself being their friend like I was my mother's friend.  And I understood them because I understood her.  And I think all of that was connected together in a way.  And it's funny.  All of that began to happen during that time, and I (laughter), it was so amazing because people were seeing me preach at the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit [Spirit and Truth Sanctuary, Decatur, Georgia] and they were seeing me preach at Evangel Church in Washington, D.C. [Evangel Missionary Baptist Church] and later at Straight Gate Church [Straight Gate International Church, Detroit, Michigan], and they thought I had a big church (laughter), and they would come to Charleston [West Virginia], and they would drive past my church trying to find the church because my church was so small.  They were looking for this big building, and I'd be standing in the front door watching them go up and down the street (laughter), trying to find me because they'd never believe that I was in this little building, but I was.  And from there, I was trying to buy this bank that would seat about six hundred people.  And out of that bank, by that time, my ministry was really rolling, and Woman--I'd gone from Woman, Thou Art Loosed! and really signed a contract, had my own TV show ['Get Ready with T.D. Jakes'] on TBN [Trinity Broadcasting Network].  And I was in the bank, and I stayed there until I left West Virginia and came to Dallas [Texas].  But it was a--I really don't notice myself what a whirlwind it was until I sit down and do something like this (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Story_ID: 617984
Speaker 1: Bishop Jakes [HistoryMaker Bishop T.D. Jakes], let me ask you how, because that is a, you know, when people are propelled forward like that, how were you internally--I know you say, you know, you still had your learning curves and things like that, but what allowed you, do you think, to be successful at that because some people can crash and burn easily?
Speaker 2: Oh, I almost crashed and burned a thousand times and still do every day.  You, it, it is a perilous journey.  Yeah, it's a perilous journey, and it's a frightening journey.  You never get safe.  Any time you're a public figure, you're never safe.  And the other thing is, any time you're catapulted into the public square you're never safe because you're not ready for that, in, in some way, either financially, emotionally, personally, domestically, something about you is never gonna be ready for the brilliancy of sudden light (laughter), you know.  If you knew it was coming, you'd a gotten dressed for it, but boom, it's on you and there you are.  And I didn't even know how to prep for it.  I'd never seen anybody do it.  So it was quite interesting.  It's been quite a journey, all of it.  It all meshes in together.  But my wife [Serita Jamison Jakes], who was, who went from being the president of the usher board and singing with the choir and making biscuits and stuff to being on, sitting beside me on TBN [Trinity Broadcasting Network] and going with me into these huge stadiums (laughter), which scared her to death, it was (unclear).  Every time I had to go speak somewhere, right in the middle of getting ready to go in the door, my wife would always have to go to the restroom, and I never understood why (laughter).  And I later realized she was scared to death.  I kept jerking her into these situations where we were in front of these masses of people (laughter), that we weren't, we weren't scripted for that.  It just happened to us, and the next thing we're at the White House [Washington, D.C.], you know, and the next thing, we're doing press conferences and 'Woman, Thou Art Loosed!' has now filled the Georgia Dome [Atlanta, Georgia] and we have eighty-six thousand people sitting there, you know.  And it was just an amazing, amazing, unbelievable experience, not to mention the enemies you develop along the way, which is a byproduct of being successful at anything and having to learn that that is normal and that there's not anything wrong, that that's just how it is and to figure out how to dance around the wolves and the predators that go along with that kind of exposure was quite educational for us and, and, and still is to some degree.  But, but we've become fairly comfortable with understanding the cost that is, that is to be paid to be who you are.
Story_ID: 617985
Speaker 1: Interesting dynamics because out of that, let's see, by, by then we were about to make the switch from Charleston [West Virginia] to Dallas [Texas].
Speaker 2: How did that come, 'cause so let's just--just real quickly.  You moved to the church.  You found a bank in--
Speaker 1: In Cross Lanes [West Virginia].
Speaker 2: --Cross Lanes, so you moved there.  How long are you in that church, sir?
Speaker 1: I think five years.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But you sort of out--another question I have, you become really a very strong TV evangelist [on 'Get Ready with T.D. Jakes'].  Okay, so what are you learning in the process about being a successful TV evangelist--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --because, you know, you have--there's Billy Graham, and, you know, but--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --I'm saying that's a whole different--everybody wants it, but--
Speaker 1: It was, it was amazing.  It was absolutely amazing.  It's not just that you're learning about being--see, I never approached television, Christian television as a televangelist.  I was who I was and just let the TV watch.  I never played to the TV, you know, you know, you know, "I'm standing here; I'm in need, bless God," and I, I just did what I did and let the camera watch.  And so that was how that happened.  But that wasn't the hard part.  It's, all of a sudden I have a staff and a budget and a payroll, and I don't mean like twenty or thirty or forty people.  I looked around, I had four hundred people on staff.  And then I've outgrown everything in Charleston.  An opportunity breaks open for me to come to West Virginia--
Speaker 2: You mean to Dallas.
Speaker 1: --to Dallas, I'm sorry.  And I went from having fifty people on staff in Charleston, which was huge to four hundred people on staff in Dallas which was unbelievable, and my ministry was blowing up on the national, international side, but at home, I had a fairly normal church.  It was a big church by Charleston's standards, but a fairly normal church.  Now, I've gone to Dallas, and now the home side is exploding.  So I've got this side exploding over here, and this side is exploding over here, and managing it, though people were often envious, it was horrific.  It was scary because now there was no normalcy anywhere.  And fifteen hundred people joined my church the first Sunday.  And I thought, oh, my god, fifteen hundred people I don't know, in a city I don't know.
Story_ID: 617986
Speaker 1: How did you choose Dallas [Texas], though?  What, what--
Speaker 2: I didn't choose Dallas.  Dallas chose me (laughter), you know.  There was a building available here.  I heard about it.  My--
Speaker 1: Talk about the building.
Speaker 2: --my accountant knew about that building.  It was being vacated by W.V. Grant, a failed televangelist who was going through a very terrible legal battle and alleged scandal.  And the building was available.  And I kept telling other people about this great deal on this building.  And finally nobody that I told would take it and I went to see about it myself and prayed in the building and thought about it and looked at it and thought, you've done everything you can do in Charleston [West Virginia].  And maybe it's time to make the move.  And my wife [Serita Jamison Jakes] and I prayed about it.  We talked about it, and we made the move.  And I taught--I did a revival in May.  I preached every Sunday night in June, still preaching at home on Sunday mornings in West Virginia.  And the first Sunday of July, I opened the doors of the church on a Sunday morning.  And that Sunday, everything exploded.  That Sunday morning fifteen hundred people joined the church.  And I thought, oh, my god, what am I gonna do.  And now I've got to move everything into place and try to figure out what's happening here.  And I thought maybe in two or three years, I'll go to two services.  In a year I was at two services.  In a year and a half, I was at four services.  In no time at all, I was going, preaching five times in twenty-four hours, just people coming in and out in an amazing way.  And the national side is still going on.  And all of a sudden, I thought, the only way for me to physically survive is to build a building.  I have no choice.  I have no place to park people.  No room to hold people.  Everything's maxed out.  I don't know whether I should say this, no toilets, no--nothing about this building is prepared for this kind of traffic.  So I have to build a building.  And nothing in my history has ever built a building.  I've always remodeled old buildings.  Now, I'm building a building for the first time, $40 some million.  Well, the church is big, but it's Baby Huey.  It's no long term wealth.  There's no wealthy, it's big, but it's juvenile.  It's, it's--and wow, you know.  And I jumped on it like you do when you're afraid of something.  You jump on it with tenacity because I thought, whew, if I don't jump on this real hard, it's gonna whip me in front of everybody 'cause everybody was saying, you know, you should--what are you doing?  You come to Dallas.  You don't know anything about Dallas, blah, blah, blah.  And little by little, a whole lot of prayer, we started building that building.  And as we started building that building and raising funds, raising funds, raising, raising, raising, raising funds cause it takes a whole lot of twenty dollar bills to make $46 million.  As we started raising those funds and go up, all of a sudden, my mother [Odith Patton Jakes] starts going down and has brain surgery, complete craniotomy and then another one and then they put a shunt in her brain because they couldn't get the fluids right from the surgery.  And then she started developing Alzheimer like symptoms.  And she's going down and the building's [The Potter's House, Dallas, Texas] going up and, and I can't stop either one of them.  And I'm stuck right in between the two of them.
Story_ID: 617987
Speaker 1: Finally, by the time we got the building open, she [Jakes' mother, Odith Patton Jakes] was dead.  And so I buried her--now, bear in mind, she's not in a nursing home somewhere.  When she got sick, I moved her in my house.  So when I get through dealing with all of the things you're talking about on television, I'm coming home, sitting at the table with her, trying to get her to open--, "Come on, open your mouth, Mama, open your mouth.  Oh, this is apple sauce.  You like apple sauce.  Come on; open your mouth."  And if I could get her to open her mouth to take it in, I couldn't get her to remember how to swallow, because Alzheimer's is the most--one of the most debilitating diseases and emotionally devastating diseases I've ever seen.  So all of that's going on in the backdrop of doing this.  And I had five children.  Let's throw that in the mix.  (Laughter) And we're now in the city [Dallas, Texas] and we're from West Virginia, (laughter) and we're in the city, in a city, in a real city like you see on TV with killings and murders and rapes and (laughter) things I had never experienced before.  It was, whew, it was quite an adventure.
Story_ID: 617988
Speaker 1: It was also, I was on the cover of Time magazine (laughter), you know.  The next thing I know I'm, I'm, I'm sitting on a set with Oprah [Oprah Winfrey].  I've been invited to 'Larry King' ['Larry King Live'].  All of that's, all of that's going on at the same time.  And now I've been invited to go to Africa and--
Speaker 2: And the White House [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: --and the White House, and the White House.
Speaker 2: The first White House invitation came under the Clinton years?
Speaker 1: Under the Clinton years, absolutely--
Speaker 2: And how did that--
Speaker 1: --preceding Monica Lewinsky.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was, I was one of the ministers in the room when Bill, President Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton], broke the story about Monica Lewinsky, odd fact that very few people know.  The date that that story broke was September 11th, yeah.  And just a few years later, on the same date, the World Trade Centers [sic. World Trade Center, New York, New York] would come down.  And that same weekend, I would be on the cover of Time magazine.  The World Trade Centers would come down, and I have both the invitations from President Clinton inviting me to the White House on September 11th and the copy of Time magazine on the weekend that the World Trade Centers went down.  And, and everything's just going bananas.
Story_ID: 617989
Speaker 1: How did he [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] come to invite you to the White House [Washington, D.C.]?  You, just, the thing I wanna touch upon is really, you're sort of leading the charge in the establishment of what we know now, nowadays as megachurches.  There was not--you know, people did not talk about a megachurch.  And you didn't even, I mean, with your telling of your roots, you didn't even know what a megachurch was (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.  And I really wasn't the first either.  I just became the poster child, and I do not know how I became the poster child.  I would love to tell you.  The reason I don't know how is that--
Speaker 1: You became the, but I, you became the most--viewed as the most successful, all of them.
Speaker 2: Yes, and still am viewed that way today, but the reality is New Birth Church [New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, Lithonia, Georgia] which Bishop Long [HistoryMaker Bishop Eddie L. Long] pastors was huge when I was still in West Virginia.  And Creflo was already in Atlanta [Georgia] when I was in West Virginia--
Speaker 1: Creflo Dollar.
Speaker 2: --and John Cherry [John A. Cherry, Sr.] was in Maryland when I was still in West Virginia in a little tiny church [Greater Emmanuel Temple of Faith, Montgomery, West Virginia], and all of those guys preceded me and was--Carlton Pearson was way bigger.  I mean to preach at Azusa was amazing.  And how I ended up becoming the poster child of megachurch pastors (laughter) I really don't know because the reality is I'm probably one of the newest of the whole consortium to be in that situation.  I mean we just built this building [The Potter's House, Dallas, Texas], what?  Maybe ten years ago now, yeah, yeah, about ten years ago.  So I mean all of them have had their churches much longer than I.  But I was out front, and I was there, and, you know how our media is today.  We can create something in twenty minutes and all of a sudden, I'm right in the line of fire and friends (laughter) for the same reason.  And it was just interesting, interesting time, interesting time.  But I cannot explain (laughter) to you how I became the poster child, and I certainly was not the first one.  But what happened was unprecedented at its time.  We were the fastest growing church in the nation, and that was true.  We were not the first, but we were the fastest growing until Joel Osteen came on and just blew the doors off of our place in the speed in which he grew up and exploded.  And the rest was history.  I mean he, by far, overshadowed anything we'd ever done.  And that was okay.  I have no problems with that.  But that, I think it wasn't that I was the first.  It was true that we were the fastest growing.  And I can't really explain to you how we were the fastest growing.  It was just, I came here and started preaching in a storefront way because I came from nothingness.  So it wasn't a major conservative, classy way.  I came here and hit it like it was gonna be hard, and everything broke--it was like punching sheet rock and it just shattered.  And it was hard, but it wasn't hard in the way I thought.  It wasn't hard to get people to come.  It was harder to learn quickly enough how do you, how do you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How do you manage all that?
Speaker 2: --how do you manage it?  Exactly, how do you manage it?  And so it's, it's been quite a journey.  You know, it's been quite a journey.

Speaker 1: Now, the things that (cough) have come out of your time, you know, in Dallas [Texas], I mean, you already had 'Woman, Thou Art Loosed!' [T.D. Jakes], but the, the men's--
Speaker 2: ManPower?
Speaker 1: Yeah, ManPower conference, did that come out of men saying that they, you know, "Hey, are you ignoring us over here?"
Speaker 2: The very first thing that happened that inspired me to talk to men was I was walking through the airport in--Pittsburgh Airport [Pittsburgh International Airport, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and saw a guy reading 'Woman, Thou Art Loosed!' who had torn the cover off the book 'cause he didn't want people to know what it was.  And he was reading the book and crying.  And I saw him in the airport, and he said, "You should have written to us because we are broken too."  And I said, oh, my god.  I don't have anything for men.  What am I gonna do about that?  They can't just rip the covers off the women's book.  And I thought, let me--because, see, to me, ministry is responding to need.  And if there's a need, you wanna fill it.  And it was obvious that there was a need there, and I wanted to fill it.  And so the ManPower.  And everybody said to me when I started the men's conference, "Men don't go to church.  Men won't give.  Men won't travel.  Men won't, won't, won't."  And everything they said men wouldn't do, men did do.  They did it.  And all of a sudden, and it was minorities, and this is happening at the same time that Promise Keepers was exploding.  But the amazing thing about it was, Promise Keepers would fill a stadium with predominantly Caucasian men which represent 87 percent of the population here.  And here I am filling a similar stadium, not as often, but a similar stadium with a small percentage of--13 percent of this country's population.  And it was just--it wasn't about me.  It wasn't about how good I was.  It was about the need and how intense the need was.  And that's true of Woman, Thou Art Loosed! and it's true about ManPower.  People say, "What is the best sermon you ever heard?"  It's the one you needed the most.  What makes a sermon great is if you need it.  And so it's not about the orator.  It's about the need of the hearer.  And that's true of anything, and not just speaking--it's true of business.  It's supply and demand.  I tell people KFC [Kentucky Fried Chicken; KFC Corporation] would have never exploded if it hadn't started at the time that people were used to home cooked meals and women had suddenly gone to work, and the timing was right.  And here comes a home cooked meal you can pick on the way home and bring it home.  And the rest was history.  I mean great management, great food, all respect to everybody, but timing was everything.  And if you do the right thing at the right time, and God just kisses it, it explodes.  But what you have to realize is that sometimes being blessed is not as easy as it looks because sometimes something can be wildly successful and, and very difficult to manage, very, very difficult to manage.

Speaker 1: What would you say is the most--what about the mega, oh god, what am I calling--mega, mega--
Speaker 2: Churches?
Speaker 1: --church.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I'm not, oh, I don't mean megachurch (laughter), the MegaFest.
Speaker 2: MegaFest.
Speaker 1: Right, because I remember being in Atlanta [Georgia] and I think we were holding an event.  And it was, you were coming in, I mean, and you were gonna take over the city, I mean literally--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --I think the people were saying, it's gonna thirty, fifty thousand people here from all over.
Speaker 2: It ended up more than that.  We broke all records.  We had about a hundred thousand people in there per night, and we had the Georgia Dome [Atlanta, Georgia], the World Congress Center [Georgia World Congress Center, Atlanta, Georgia], the Philips Arena [Atlanta, Georgia], all simultaneously, filled to the brim; events going on all the time.  We had universal for the kids.  We had, as I recall, about ten thousand children under twelve [years old] registered.  We had nearly 10 percent of the crowd came from outside of the continental U.S.A.  It was crazy.  We had 212 press people.  I remember that distinctly from sixty-seven different press outlets as far away as the London Times [The Times] and it just--it was just amazing.  And what, but what was wonderful about MegaFest, (laughter) it wasn't the budget cause we never met it (laughter).  And people thought we were making out like grand theft auto, and what we were making was grand theft bills (laughter), you know.  That's a whole 'nother story, but what was amazing about it was it was a very clear picture of its founder because it had health.  It had economic empowerment summits.  It had religious services.  It had entertainment.  It had comedy shows.  It had musicals.  And it was all up under one umbrella which is the diversity and the complexity of the way I think.  It was the outworking of the internal way that I think, that why should spiritual people just have church like they don't have bodies.  They need health too.  They eat food too.  They wanna know about retirement too.  Why should we just be (air quotes) this, you know, when we are all of that.  And we need to laugh, and we have families, and I just thought, why can't we go to one place and have everything in like a mall like environment.  And if you don't need this, you can pick and choose what fits you.  And I thought it was a grand idea, and I did it.  And I did it again in Atlanta, and then I didn't do it for a year or two and took it to South Africa and did it in South Africa.  And we drew over a hundred thousand people in Johannesburg, South Africa.  We had five planeloads of people to come from the U.S. to South Africa.  And it was all wonderful, and where it goes from here, I don't know, you know.  Sometimes I think I'll do it again and sometimes I think, let's don't, and say you did (laughter), you know.  You're worn out. You wanna rest, fifty some year old, thirty-three years in the ministry, just chill.  Find a, a bridge somewhere and throw a fishing line into it, see if you can talk a sea bass into biting some lunch (laughter).

Speaker 1: Let me ask you, Bishop Jakes [HistoryMaker Bishop T.D. Jakes], out of all the things you've done because, I mean we can talk about you know the books you've published, you've done two, two movies and now a third one--
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: --a third one coming.  As you said, you've been touted by presidents.  People really sort, you know, I think both in the black community and the white community see you as sort of a go to person.  What, what are the things that you're most proud of, you know, when you look back?
Speaker 2: You know the things that I'm most proud of are the things that got the least attention.  The paramount thing that I'm most proud of, of everything I've ever did in my life was to take care of my mother [Odith Patton Jakes] 'til she died.  There's absolutely nothing that I'm more proud of than that, to have kept my commitment to see love go full circle is the opiate of anything that I ever set out to do in my life, was to get to say thank you.  So that, bar none, is in a class all by itself.  And it was my greatest privilege and honor to have gotten to show her that when she needed me, I would be there.  So, to date, there's nothing that passes that.
Story_ID: 617993
Speaker 1: The next thing would probably be the look on the faces of the kids in Africa when water starts gushing out of those wells.  That was just absolutely amazing.  It was just absolutely amazing to see, to see people that happy about water.
Speaker 2: Talk about your work in Africa because we have to talk about it in context.
Speaker 1: We dig wells for indigenous people in the rural parts of Africa, Kenya, in particular, and some other places throughout Africa where there is no water.  And I wanted to do it, and I thought it was right to do it, and there's an ecological reason to do it, there's the, the decline of water and the desperate need that people had for water.  But nothing prepared me for the look on those people's faces.  It was just, it was just absolutely amazing, the most incredible thing I ever saw in my life.  They didn't have electricity.  They didn't have plumbing.  They didn't have proper schooling.  They didn't have newspapers.  And they were dancing in the dust about water.  And I thought, I can do this.  I can do this.  Well, that to me was a great accomplishment, and not to do one well, but to plant wells over and over again.  Once place, there had been 167 people killed between the two tribes, fighting over water.  And we dug a well for both tribes and did a reconciliation service.  That was incredible.  When I finally did come to Kenya to speak, because when we first came to Kenya, we didn't come to speak.  We came to help.  When I finally did come to Kenya to speak and look out and seeing nearly a million people in Uhuru Park in Nairobi [Kenya] who came out to see me, that was just incredible too because it wasn't just about preaching.  It was about helping.  That was, that was something.  I mean there are other things.  I'm not minimizing.  To be on the cover of Time magazine that weekend until the World Trade Centers [sic. World Trade Center, New York, New York] went down, I was like delirious, and it was, it was a well written, well thought out article that got it, you know (laughter).  You don't always get that, and that was just incredible until the World Trade Centers blew up and then it was suddenly unimportant.  And suddenly, I began to recognize that maybe I was on the cover of Time so I could be there to help walk the nation through a very dark place.  And I was on CNN for hours and hours and hours and hours, just talking to people who were distraught.  And I was glad to be able to do something, to give something back, to be able to be useful.  I mean I'm not a fireman, I'm not a police officer.  But just to be able to be useful when people are in the throes of grief was just--that was the wonderful part about that.  I've had like, almost innumerable great experiences, but those were some of the most significant ones.  The things that impacted me the most were not the ones that always had cameras involved with them.  They were little things that I saw behind the scenes that really dealt with where people really are.  Yeah, and that's not to say that everything else wasn't--the NAACP Image Awards, we won Grammys [Grammy Award] and that was wonderful.  The movie thing was great.  The fact that Sony [Sony Pictures Entertainment] would give me a first look deal for seven pictures is incredible.
Speaker 2: So this is, so you're halfway through the movie deal then?
Speaker 1: Well, almost half with this new project (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  I see.
Speaker 1: And the way the deals probably work is, you're probably as, as good as your last film (laughter).  If it's bad enough, they'll find a way to get out, and it's good enough, they'll find a way to continue.  Yeah, but that's where we are.
Speaker 2: That's the movie industry though (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, absolutely.
Story_ID: 617994
Speaker 1: I wanna (cough) ask several more questions.  I wanna ask about--well, well, we won't go past this time period, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: I wanna ask about your role with the Bush administration because he made a special outreach to the black--well, to the religious communities, but to the black religious community and you were sort of, you know, very instrumental or very involved with that.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Is that the right statement?
Speaker 2: No, no, it's fine.  You can say it any way you want to.  Let me--President Bush [President George Walker Bush] was our governor.  So my relationship with him began when he was the governor of the State of Texas.  He was the one who dedicated the land over here when we bought four hundred acres of land.  He was our governor.  So when he began to talk about running for the presidency, I was aware of that.  And when he became president, I was there at the inauguration as were most of the pastors from our area.  His emphasis on the faith based initiative really wasn't new, but it was much more publicized.  His determination to reach out to black clergy was not in my opinion, not purely political, though it certainly had its political benefits.  It was an outreach of what he did as a governor that he was really trying to break down some barriers and some walls here.  I really wasn't as close to the fire as people thought that I was.  All you have to do is for somebody to write a line in an article and all of a sudden, you're a lot closer than you thought you were before.  And some things I didn't know that I was 'til I read them in The Washington Post.  (Laughter) That's true because it made it sound like we were running around eating Whoppers and going over each other's house, and that's never been how it was.  But that was the seat I found myself sitting in.
Story_ID: 617995
Speaker 1: When Katrina [Hurricane Katrina]--I did have the kind of relationship that I thought I could get a message or a phone call through.  And when Katrina came around, and he asked me to come to Baton Rouge [Louisiana]. It wasn't because I agreed with how he handled it, it was because I thought that I had an opportunity to say some things to him and that he would at least consider what I had to say in a very unique way that very few black men did.  I had seven thousand partners that lived in that area.  As I've told you now, my parents [Odith Patton Jakes and Ernest Jakes, Sr.] are from that area.  I have cousins and relatives who live in that area.  My, my, my people are buried in that area.  So the Gulf [Gulf Coast] was pretty close to home for me, and when I turned on the TV set and saw those people screaming from the roof, they looked like my relatives and my cousins and my grandmother.  And I had an opportunity to say something to the president of the United States.  And even though it drew a lot of criticism, I was willing to take the criticism because I had the relationship to go in there.  I didn't have to carry a sign or scream in a microphone or, or yell insults at him.  I could talk right to him.  And I got a chance to do that.  I knew then something that people would learn later, that it wasn't just the federal government that had failed.  It was far more complicated than the allegation George Bush [President George Walker Bush] doesn't like black people.  It was much deeper than that.  It was a failure between state, federal and city government of mammoth proportions that had gone back years and years and years and misallocations of funds and funds not being put where they should have been put, for the levy.  It was much more complicated.  I knew that then.  I didn't have time to do a PR [public relations] campaign.  I wanted to go in and say to him, the monies have to be allocated, not only to the people who are distraught, but to their families who have twenty-eight people living in a two bedroom apartment who are running out of groceries and losing their jobs in Dallas [Texas] and Houston [Texas] and everywhere.  And we need a system that we--and a myriad of other things that I thought needed to be said and said them.  And I think that I was able to make some impact.  Sometimes I believe God positions you in a place so that you can make a difference.  You are not the man, but you're close enough to say something to the man.  And when that comes, you can't worry about how people perceive you.  You have to do some things because they're right, not because they look good on camera.  I was unhappy with how slow the federal government was to respond and people who heard me speak at the National Cathedral [Cathedral Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul in the City and Diocese of Washington, Washington, D.C.] soon learned what I really thought about it because I said so all over the world, that the 9th Ward is not just in New Orleans [Louisiana], that it's in New York [New York] and it's in Dallas, and it's everywhere and that they hadn't uncovered poverty.  They just ignored it and that we could do much better for poor people in this country than we do.  I thought that all the while.  But timing was everything.  Right then was not the time to argue about whose fault it was.  Right then was the time to get our grandmothers off the roof, and that was why I was there.  And throughout his administration, throughout President Clinton's [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] administration, and now with President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], I have tried to walk the fine line of being available to the most powerful person in the free world, and yet not be sucked into the political machine and process that often can taint clergy if they get too close.
Story_ID: 617996
Speaker 1: I have three questions.
Speaker 2: What's the most important one of the three?
Speaker 1: Well, the most important--well, there're two important ones.
Speaker 2: What are they?
Speaker 1: Okay, one, what is your--we always end with a legacy question so I wanna have that.  What do you want your legacy to be?  The second, the other question I'd like to ask, okay, if I just have two, is--well, I want to ask about your hopes and concerns about the black community and I also wanna ask you what haven't you done that you would like to do.  So can we start with your hopes and concerns about the black community?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I am an eternal optimist, so when I look at the black community, I look at it with optimism, in spite of its many flaws, in spite of the many injustices that have really, really, really assaulted the fiber of the black community, I just believe that we're a very strong, tenacious people and that we will always rise to the top like cream.  I am concerned that we don't--I am not nearly as concerned about racism at this point because of the wonderful things that have been done through civil rights and down through the years.  I am not nearly as concerned about racism and how other races see us as I am about self denigration and how we see ourselves, about black on black crime, about violence in our schools, about the single parents and the absentee fathers, and the things that we do to ourselves I think are far more dangerous than anything that anybody is doing to us now, as opposed to things that they did to our ancestors.  My concern is the community that I miss is the community that nodded when the women walked down the street, that helped our grandmothers carry grocery in the house, that said, "Boy, get up and go home, and I'm gonna tell your mama when you get home."  I miss all of that.  Realistically, I don't know if we'll ever see that again because in the back of my mind, I wonder was it not the oppression of the times that created the unity of the moment.  And the challenge of the community for me is can we be unified without oppression?  I get troubled.  I'm not against marching.  Everybody marches.  But I get troubled when the moment we have a problem, we go out to march, which worked in the '60s [1960s].  But without the dogs barking and the hoses, I wonder if it was the marching or the hoses and the dogs that shamed America into change.  And in this high tech Internet age, I'm afraid sometimes we're carrying signs, when maybe we should push buttons.  I worry about the creativity and the forward thinking of the leadership of our community.  I think that sometimes we are busy doing what has already been done rather than doing what we ought to do next.  I think that we're afraid that progress means we're using our community.  I don't think that we have to be in a geographical location.  I don't think we all have to live on the same side of the tracks.  I don't think it's about zip codes that determine your loyalty to the black community.  And I am concerned, as long as highly educated, intellectual, affluent, gifted or wealthy black people have to burn their black card and are no longer accepted by the community because they don't talk with enough ethnicity or they don't live in the right demographic and now your, your blackness is not considered authentic.  As long as we excommunicate the strongest of us and leave in the herd the weakest of us, then we will not procreate the best for us.  We have to understand that talking right is not talking white.  We have to understand that just because a person left the neighborhood, they have not forgotten where they came from.  We have to assimilate into a society that has bigger issues now to deal with than the issues of our past, no matter how endeared they are to us.  And I worry about that.
Story_ID: 617997
Speaker 1: I worry that any time a black person doesn't come in the form that we find most acceptable, in, in the color with the right politics, with the right sexuality, with the theology, that they're, they're suddenly not black.  I get sick when I hear statement like, "Is President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] black enough?"  How black do you have to be in a people that have always been a blend of many races and cultures since slavery?  We easily let go of people for all kinds of reasons.  You're not black enough.  You don't talk right enough.  You don't vote the way I vote.  You don't believe in the same religion I believe in so now I'm through with you.  I can disagree with you and not be through with you.  If, if we are gonna be a family, and more importantly, being a black family, understand the fact that we are a human family which is bigger even than our own color and culture and that we have to fit within the context of all people and develop a mutual respect and appreciation for all people and understand that melting into a pot may not be a bad thing, that, that our children don't think the way we do and they don't feel the way we do.  And we have to open our minds to respecting all people and having all people respect us.  It's very, very important.  I'm concerned that we don't continue to treat our own wounded.  The reason I started our T.O.R.I. program, our Texas Offenders Reentry Initiative because I believe that we are the people we've been waiting for, that nobody's gonna be able to get through to our wounded until they see somebody come through the door who looks like us; that they're gonna open more readily to somebody who looks like their mama or their grandmamma or their great-grandmother than they will somebody outside of their own culture.  I welcome anybody who wants to come get me if I'm stuck on the roof, but by the same token, if a child has a learning disability or never had a father or has been raised in juvenile delinquent environments, he doesn't just need to see white clergy or white churches.  He needs to see somebody who looks like him come through the door.  And I think until we make being smart cool again, until we start marketing education to our students, until we start respecting our own people, until we start treating our women with respect, until we start going after our wounded people, no matter what they did.  We understand why they got wounded.  We can't leave them in the foxhole just because they fell, because there, but for the grace of God, goes I.  And those are the worries that I have, but the exciting thing that I have is that as a black boy who stood there and watched his father with tears welled up in his eyes at the Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] I Have a Dream speech, I got to carry my son to the inauguration of the first person of color, president of the United States within the same lifespan.  Wow, how amazing is that?  And no matter what you think about his politics or agree with his leadership, that was a moment that says something about America that is encouraging, that the whole world took note of.  And I got to see it with my son.  For the first time in my life, I can say to my son what white men have been able to say to their sons for years and really mean it.  "You could be president of the United States." And now, I can really mean it, that I'm optimistic--I'm, oh god, I can't even tell you what that does to me as a father to get to carry my youngest son [Thomas Dexter Jakes] to see that, so that when I'm dead, as my father [Ernest Jakes, Sr.] was dead, he can talk about sharing this historical moment with me, was a great gift.  To see people like Dr. Jemison [Mae Jemison] in the space program [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], to see Henry Louis Gates [HistoryMaker Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr.] in academics, to see people moving and going and people that I got to touch and talk to and know, wow, that was great to have seen and talked with Oprah [Oprah Winfrey] and seen these people who are iconic.  They're--it's not that there aren't other great people.  My real heroes are people who lived down the street from me and aunts and uncles and stuff, but they do represent a shift.  They have given us permission to think outside the box and to dream again.  And a people with dreams in the night cannot be killed in the light.  So I am optimistic that children will find better reasons to go to school and that, that families will begin to mend and, and heal because a country is no better than its, its community and a community is no better than its families and so if we can heal the family, we can heal the entire country.
Story_ID: 617998
Speaker 1: The question was, the other question that was the--the other question was what haven't you done that you would like to still do with your life?
Speaker 2: Rest (laughter), I would like to--
Speaker 1: We had talked about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would like (laughter), whew, I think my focus now is to move from destiny to legacy.  It is not about goals that I have for me.  It is about taking the things that I learned along the way, the things that I did right and the things I did wrong, the mistakes I made as well as the successes I had and whisper them in the ears of our sons and daughters so that maybe they won't have the learning curve.  And maybe they won't hurt so bad while they climb and maybe they won't be so scared while they fly.  Maybe they'll know things that I had to stumble into and figure out and if nothing else, they'll know that somebody else wished them well.  If I can do that, then, and leave something behind that makes it easier.  I've sent countless kids through college.  I've paid their tuition all the way through school, that they could just get a shove down the runway to make it.  I think that's really positive.  I think that's really, really neat.  And the only other thing I want out of life to be remembered for, if not a great preacher, if not a great community leader, that's okay.  But to have not been remembered to be a great friend and a great man would be a great loss because what I have sought most to be was a friend to those who suffered and an ear to those with secrets and a hand of compassion to those who fell in the mud.  And if I go down in history for that, then that's, that's enough accolades for me.  I'm good with that.  I'm good with that.  I want to be the friend I wish I had.
Story_ID: 617999
Speaker 1: And your legacy?
Speaker 2: That's it.  That's my legacy.  That's what I want. Doesn't have to be a monument, doesn't have to be a statue.  They don't have to put my name on the building next door.  They don't have to name a program after me or anything like that.  My legacy will live in the lives of the people who heard me.  They will be the wind and the feet of the young people who ran because of me.  If I can say something that makes the next one coming after me run faster, overcome obstacles, get up out of the mud and try again, they will be living legacy and nobody has to come and sit on a bench beside them and feed any pigeons.  I'm cool with them being on the move.  And I had a part of it.
