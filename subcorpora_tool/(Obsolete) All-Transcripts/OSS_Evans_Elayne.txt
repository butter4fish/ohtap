 Gill and today is February 16, 2009. I   m visiting with  Elayne Evans in her home in Okemah, Oklahoma. This interview is for  the O-State Stories Project of the Oklahoma Oral History Research  Program. Elayne, let me start with your early life. You were born in  Boley?  Born in Boley.  Can you tell me a little bit about your family, connection to Boley, and a  little bit about the history of the Boley community?  I don   t really know much history of the Boley community other than it  was one of the original all-black towns in Oklahoma. I lived at  Clearview. I was just born at Boley because that   s where the doctor was  and the doctor   s hospital.  And for those of us that may not know where Clearview is, that   s      Clearview is in Okfuskee County, about the central southeast part of  Okfuskee County   about eight miles east and south of Okemah.  So did you have any relatives in the Boley area?  No.  Well can you share some memories of your early life and growing up?  I was an only child, lived on a farm, went to Clearview public schools  for the first ten years. The last two years I transferred to Weleetka,  which was six miles away, and graduated from Weleetka High School.  Was there a reason why you transferred to Weleetka?  5  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Yes, I had decided several years prior to that time that I wanted to be a  secretary. To be a secretary back in the 1960   s, you needed shorthand  and typing, which they did not offer at Clearview. Clearview was  another one of the original all-black towns in Oklahoma. When I was  growing up, the population was about 250 at the most, and now it   s  down to about 40, so it   s a small community.  Some of your ancestors helped found the town?  No. My dad moved to Clearview about 1913 from Ashdown, Arkansas.  He had an uncle who was a merchant in Clearview, and his family  moved to Oklahoma because they wanted better education for their  children, so they came into Clearview, Oklahoma.  What did your dad do?  My dad was a rural mail carrier. He was a rural mail carrier for 47 years  and retired at mandatory age 70, and he was retired for longer than most  people work on a job  (Laughter) He lived to be 104 years old.  Wow. That was just here a year ago?  He passed away in October of 2008.  When he first started, was he the first black rural mail carrier in  Oklahoma?  I don   t think he was the first black, but there were not very many of  them. He was probably the first one that really became active in the  politics of being a rural mail carrier, the Oklahoma Rural Letter Carriers  Association as well as the National Rural Letter Carriers Association.  Did he ever hold any offices of those organizations?  Yes, he was   I don   t remember the ones he held when I was younger.  I   d have to go back and look at the things that I   ve written up, but one of  the things that he was most proud of, after he retired he was PAC  chairman   Political Action Committee. Oklahoma was about number  two in the nation per capita on their PAC contributions, so he was real  proud of that, and he was an active member of the Retired Rural Letter  Carriers Association for many years also. He enjoyed going to the  meetings and helping in that way. He attended all the district meetings  and the state meetings, and I believe he said he attended about seventeen  or eighteen of the national conventions in a row without missing any,  (Laughs) and he was a delegate most of those years. That was one of his  things that he liked.  6  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Well Elayne, what values did you learn in your home and in your  family?  Probably honesty, just try to do your very best. That   s kind of what was  expected of you, and you just did it.  You probably learned hard work. You lived on a farm?  I lived on a farm, yes. As a girl and an only child, I guess I probably  wasn   t overworked. I did spend a lot of time outside with my dad     didn   t spend a whole lot of time inside with my mother   driving the  tractors and helping with the farm work. When I was little, my dad  raised   well, when I was coming along, he raised sweet potatoes, and so  I did a lot of work helping set out sweet potatoes and dig sweet potatoes  and whatever. I also worked with the cattle to a certain extent.  Did you do a lot of canning with your mother and those kinds of things?  I did a little bit, yes. I did a little bit.  How did your family experiences growing up and the values you  learned, how did that impact your later life?  Probably just, like I said, honesty and doing your very best at whatever.  My dad took a lot of pride in doing things very accurately and orderly  and on-time. When he carried the mail, people would say they could set  their watch by him being on time. Just learning those types of values and  keeping your word.  Was the church a big part of your early life?  Yes. In a small town, I grew up in the Methodist church, but we did not  have church every week. The Methodists had church on the first and  third Sundays, and the Baptists had church on the second and fourth  Sundays. So everyone went to church in the community, and that was  one of the things that we had to do. In a small community, the church is  a big part of it.  So you graduated from Weleetka High School in 1962?  1962. I was fortunate enough to be one of the co-valedictorians of  Weleetka High School.  Congratulations. Did that help you with some scholarship money? Did  you earn some scholarships?  7  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  I did get   I think it was called a Regents Scholarship back in those  days   a Regents Scholarship and      A four-year scholarship?  I   m not sure. I think it was. It was part tuition   reduction of tuition.  Tuition waiver scholarship?  Well, it didn   t completely. It was just partial, (Laughter) yes   partial     but back in those days, tuition was only seven dollars a credit hour. But  still that was a lot of money.  So what influenced you to come to Oklahoma State? I mean, you  probably had other choices. Of course, maybe the scholarship helped a  little bit.  Well, I really didn   t look at any other schools. I went to Stillwater back  about 1953 or    54, somewhere in the early    50s, maybe    55, to a  National Rural Letter Carriers meeting that they   the national meeting  was in Stillwater. We stayed at Bennett Hall, had the meetings in the  Student Union, and I met a couple of girls from South Dakota. Of course  I was the only black there, but I met a couple of girls from South  Dakota, and we were the official elevator operators in the Student  Union. (Laughter) So we operated the elevators for everybody going to  the meeting, and I just really fell in love with the campus, the formal  gardens. The Student Union looked then just like it looks now, really,  out front. The formal gardens were really pretty, and I just liked the  campus, and I said,    That   s where I   m going to go to school when I  grow up,    and so that   s what I did.  Had any other members of your family attended college?  My mother   s a Jayhawk. She went to KU.  Did she get her degree from      She did not. No, she did not graduate from KU. She went two, maybe  three years   at least two years   and contracted polio. So she was home  for the summer, I think, working. Anyway, she came down with polio,  so she was paralyzed for a year, and her next-door neighbor helped her  with what we would call now physical therapy. She was just helping her  do things and      Did she partially recover from it?  8  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  She was about 95 percent recovered from her bout with polio, yes.  That   s amazing.  But she never went back to finish her degree, but she was a loyal  Jayhawker.  She was a Jayhawk.  Yes, she pulled for OSU whenever we played any sports unless we  played KU, and then she   d pull for KU.  Rock Chalk Jayhawk.  Rock Chalk Jayhawk, yes. My dad was not privileged to attend college.  He did graduate from   went to high school at Langston. Langston had a  high school in those days on the university campus. He went to Langston  from Clearview because in those days Clearview did not have a high  school. He would have to go off somewhere to attend high school.  Because of a 4-H project in recordkeeping, he had a scholarship to  Langston, so he and his pig, his 4-H project, his hog, went to Langston,  and he was there for, I think it was, three years, but he did graduate from  Langston. I   ve forgotten the official name of it now   Langston Normal  High School or something. I have his diploma. I don   t remember now  where it is, but      Did he have relatives he stayed with? I mean, was that   s a long ways  from home.  No, on the campus.  He stayed on campus, but he actually went to the high school?  He did high school studies there. They had the university there, but they  had a high school division, and that   s where he graduated from in 1925.  Well, when you came on campus, there   we had this discussion earlier  with Claud   but there were not very many African-American female  students there?  No.  You probably got to know most of them pretty well, I guess?  Oh, yes. Oh, yes. You knew the names and where they were from.  9  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Did you feel comfortable     I did.  Adjusted to that? Did you      I didn   t have any problems. I basically went there to go to school, and  that   s basically what I did   studied for school.  Where did you live on campus?  I lived in Murray Hall.  Did you stay there your whole time at school?  I stayed in Murray on the first floor of the south wing the entire four  years.  Are you excited they   re renovating it now?  Yes, but it   s going to be different. I   m anxious to see what it   s going to  look like, but at least they didn   t tear it down. I enjoyed Murray.  We got some clue maybe to this earlier because of where you went to  high school, but what did you major in?  In business. I majored in business, yes.  Office management.  Office management. At that time, I think they were saying office  management with an accounting option. I took the accounting option.  Do you recall some of the professors that you had at the time? Any of  them register?  I remember Dr. Anderson, I believe. He was an accounting professor.  Wilton Anderson?  Wilton Anderson; I think he   s probably the only one I really remember  by name.  I understand he was department head but he still taught the introductory  classes. Isn   t that right?  10  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  He was good. Yes, he was good. I remember him.  How did you do in his accounting classes? You don   t have to give the  grade, just did you do okay?  I did okay. I did okay.  I heard he was pretty tough.  I did okay.  Now were any of your classes taught by African-American teachers, by  black professors?  I had a history class that was taught by a graduate assistant. There were  no black professors or whatever when I was there. There was a graduate  assistant, and I cannot remember his name. He was from Arkansas. I  believe it was history.  Did you feel welcomed by the white students there?  Yes, I did not have any problem. I lived on, like I said, the south wing of  the first floor of Murray. There were, I guess, four black students on the  floor; there were like twenty rooms there. Two rooms had black students  in them and the rest were white, and we just all got along just very, very  well.  Did you have a black roommate?  Yes. Most of the semesters, yes. One summer I roomed with a girl that  was next door to us during the fall. We just kind of all stayed there the  four years in the same proximity, but I went to one summer school and  roomed with Janet Entwhistle, a white girl, but otherwise      So it sounded like there was some social interaction that you had  between the white students and      Oh, yes   in the dorms, yes.  Are there any less than positive experiences that you recall in your  undergraduate years?  You know, I really didn   t have any. Most people   or some people said  they feel like when they come from a small town or a small school going  to a big university like that, they feel like they get lost or whatever, but I  found that I saw the same people basically because of the classes I was  11  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  in. You   re going down the sidewalks, and you run into the same people  going between classes, and there may be 15,000 kids on campus, but you  only see a few dozen at a time   or a few hundred at a time   so I did not  have any problems.  What were some of your favorite student hangouts at the time?  I hung out in my room. (Laughter)  Other than your room. (Laughter)  In my room and the library. The fourth floor of the Student Union, I  guess, was the other hangout. I did not have a car so I didn   t hang out  too far off campus, in terms of hanging out. I did do activities at the  Wesley Foundation, and it was real close by, within walking distance,  two blocks.  Were you involved in some other activities in addition to Wesley  Foundation? Student organizations?  Well I was involved with Kappa Phi with Wesley Foundation. Did  pledge Delta Sigma Theta sorority my junior year, but it was not on  campus. It was a city-wide chapter that had some members from OSU,  some members from OU, some members from Central State, and some  members from Oklahoma College for Women at that time. It was  through the Oklahoma City Alumni Chapter.  Back in the early    60s, where did you go for dates? What were some of  the favorite places?  The library, the Student Union. We   d go occasionally to movies, or  sometimes if it was nice weather we   d just walk downtown and just look  around.  Did you go to the Campus Theater across town?  Campus Theater.  The Aggie downtown?  I don   t know if we went to the Aggie downtown. Most times when we  went downtown, we   d just walk around downtown, window shop, and  walk back.  They had the Leachman Theater I guess there, too.  12  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Yes, the Leachman Theater. And there were a few campus parties, I  guess you might say.  Did you work during your student years?  I did. A couple of years I worked as a   we called it desk clerk at that  time, in the dorm. That was it.  Did you have any door duties? I mean we had pretty strict hours most  times.  Oh, yes, we had hours at that time. So, yes, basically answer the phone  and check people in and      Make sure they were in?  Yes, check rooms at night. That was a big deal with the girls. Check  rooms at the time they   re supposed to be in.  Let me see, I guess a big social issue was PDA at the time, public  display of affection?  Yes. (Laughter)  Surely you didn   t ever get caught for that, did you?  Oh, no.  We won   t go there. Do you have some favorite memories of your times at  OSU?  Favorite memories. Well, let   s see. We got married at OSU.  That would be a favorite.  Yes, that would be one of those. We got married at Bennett Chapel and  had a reception at   was it Georgian Lounge? I   m not sure if it   s still  Georgian Lounge or not, on the third floor in the new wing of the  Student Union.  Speaking of this guy you married, Claud Evans, when did you first meet  Claud, and what did you think about this guy?  Well, he says that he had met me in September of    62 when I first came  on campus. I really don   t remember him back then.  13  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  He didn   t make much of an impression, did he? (Laughter)  Well, you know, you   re a new person, and you   re meeting all of these  people that are there already and, okay,    Hi. How are you? Where are  you from?    We just kind of knew people by their names and where they  were from, and I guess I probably remember him more about the spring  of    63   I started in the fall of    62   toward the spring, near the end of  the school year.  Your freshman year?  Freshman year, yes. I think we had a date then, and then I guess it was  probably into the sophomore year when we started dating.  Did you take him home to meet your parents? Was that when it got  serious?  I think   well, he had met my parents because they had come up for  some football games and a couple of basketball games, back in the days  when you could come up and go to a football game on just borrowing  someone down the hall   s ID pass (Laughs) and go right on in the  football game.  Like the basketball rush and you had the odd/even ID?  Odd/even, yes. I don   t think they came up to many basketball games, but  they came up to football games and to Parents    Day or whatever. So, you  know, they saw him but tried to ignore him probably. (Laughter)  So you got your bachelor   s degree in office management in the College  of Business Administration in 1966?  That   s correct.  Was it an option for you to get an accounting degree? Because you took  some accounting courses as part of the program, but did you have any  interest in getting an accounting degree? Was it an option for you?  I still had my mind set on being a secretary. I did have enough hours to  have extended it to an accounting degree.  Have a minor in      Yes, but after four years, just I was ready to get out of here. (Laughter)  Could you share a little bit with me about your professional career after  14  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  you   of course you and Claud were at Tuskegee and then with different  companies, but in those years, what were you doing? What kind of job  did you have?  Oh, earlier you were mentioning the scholarships and whatever      Yes.  I was fortunate enough, blessed enough, to receive the Bud Seretean  Scholarship, and I   m not sure how I got selected for that. I just got a  letter in the mail. I was fortunate enough to make the dean   s honor roll a  few semesters. I don   t think I ever made a president   s honor roll. I made  the dean   s honor roll.  President   s was 4.0 and the dean   s was 3.5 or better.  Yes.  So you made the dean   s honor roll.  I made the dean   s honor roll a few times but   I think about three  times   but anyway, the      So you must have graduated around that 3.5 grade point average or  something.  No, I actually dropped down a little bit. Business Law pulled me down a  little (Laughs) and Humanities   Business Law and Humanities.  It wasn   t a history class was it, surely? (Laughter)  No. But yes, I was fortunate enough to receive the Seretean Scholarship.  That helped out, too, didn   t it?  Oh, that helped out tremendously because that was the junior, senior  year.  What were some of your   I   m still going back to your experience before  I asked that. Before you answer the question I asked, is there anything     I mean anything in your friendships, relationships that you made, people  you still stay in touch with?  I still stay in touch with quite a few of them Claud and I both knew.  When there are not very many people around, you know the same  people.  15  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Sure.  My roommates. One roommate that I roomed with probably three years,  three of the four years, is in Memphis, and we stay in touch. Some of the  others we correspond at Christmas time with, and then there   s a few that  I   ve lost touch with, but like I said, we   ve stayed in touch with quite a  few of them.  Well, Elayne, back to the question about how had your degree helped  you in your early years and positions that you had while Claud was  pursuing his professional career before you came back to Oklahoma.  Okay. After graduation, we went on the book field with ... Well, actually  I introduced him to the book field in a roundabout way   well, almost  directly, I guess, because I knew Jeanne and Clyde Irving from the  Wesley Foundation, and I guess Clyde was talking about selling books  and maybe recruiting. I   m not exactly sure how. But anyway I think I  got Claud over to a meeting, talking about it (Laughter), and he decided  he   d do it and then he pulled in Kenneth Kimbrough to go with him.  That   s how he got connected with Southwestern so      Great story.      it was through Clyde and Jeanne Irving and through the Wesley  Foundation. So we went to   I   m kind of rounding a little bit, but after  we started dating pretty seriously, we went to the Baptist church on  Sunday morning because we could walk. It was within walking distance.  And then occasionally we   d go down to First Methodist Church, but it  was a little bit outside of walking distance unless you could get a ride  with someone from the Wesley Foundation.  University Heights Baptist Church?  University Heights, yes. University Heights Baptist Church. But I stayed  in touch with the Wesley Foundation and the people that were there.  After graduation, we went out that summer for the book field,  Southwestern book field, had an automobile accident, came back home  for a couple of months, but I was able to get a job with Tuskegee  Institute School of Nursing. I was a secretary to the dean. Her secretary  had   maybe had graduated or her husband had graduated, but she did  not have a secretary, so I was able to go right in to being the dean   s  secretary. So I was there four years, excluding summers. I told them  when I started that I wouldn   t be available during the summer, so she  said if I did a good enough job during the school year that she could  limp through the summer (Laughter) which is what she did. I came back  to it after every summer, so for four years I was the dean   s secretary at  16  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  the School of Nursing. During the summer I worked one year for an  insurance company in Fort Worth, Texas, while he was selling books,  and the summer of    69 I worked for the Brookings Institution in  Washington, D.C., while he was selling books, right down the street  from the White House.  Well, what did you do at the Brookings Institute?  Secretary   more coffee breaks than anything else. (Laughter)  They don   t work as hard at the Capital?  They   well, yes, we took a lot of coffee breaks. I don   t drink coffee, but  I took the break time anyway.  That   s great. (Laughter)  As an entry level person, it was basically just a clerk-typist type  secretary, but it brought in a little bit of money and gave me something  to do during the summer.  Now, let   s see. After Tuskegee, you moved to Davis?  Davis, California.  California.  I was secretary, yes, for the city planner and the Planning Commission  for the City of Davis.  Planning Commission of the City of Davis?  Yes. Didn   t have the foggiest idea what a city plan was. In Clearview,  Oklahoma, we did not have zoning restrictions  (Laughter)  Zoning wasn   t a problem?  Zoning was not an issue, not a problem at all  But I learned a lot about  zoning. I learned a lot about city council, having to take minutes at those  meetings and keep up the skills   great experience.  That   s great. And after you were in California for awhile     One year at Davis, California, then to Saint Louis, Missouri. I told him  that I made one mistake. I should have worked for an airline so we could  have had free airline tickets, but I didn   t. American Airlines, I guess,  17  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  was hiring people there, but I didn   t even interview with them. But I did  work for Ralston Purina Company. Very convenient, because we had  one car at the time and we could drive in together, so I accepted that job  in the tax department. Started out   I believe I started out as maybe a  clerk-typist, I   m not really sure, but after I got in there for a few weeks  or a few months or whatever, it worked out that I started doing some of  the payroll tax returns. Then the payroll tax manager went out on leave,  maternity leave, for awhile, so I got promoted to assistant manager of  payroll taxes, where I stayed for the time that I was there.  Those accounting classes paid off for you? (Laughs)  Accounting classes, they did finally pay off, yes.  That   s great.  So I worked in the legal department in the tax division during that time.  We talked earlier about your coming back to Oklahoma to Okemah,  close to your hometown   or actually I guess your parents were living  here then at the time just outside of, your farm there.  Yes, we were just eight miles away.  So this partnership role, you   re creating this thing   your job was  business manager. And I say    was,    but it still is?  Yes, it   s supposedly office manager, yes.  Office manager. Can you share with us some of the responsibilities?  Well, let   s see. Sometimes it   s assistant surgeon, (Laughs) but you do  whatever you have to do. But basically, I   m in charge of maintaining the  office, placing the orders, doing the books, appointments. The last  fifteen years, though, I have been altering my job. The job title   s still  there,  but  I   ve altered my duties because of my parents ... As an only  child, when my parents    health started failing, we were helping them,  trying to keep them out of the nursing home and taking care of them. So  we brought them here to live with us. It was a little difficult to make that  trip, only eight miles away, but still all hours of the day and night on a  moment   s notice. So I pretty much moved my office from next door at  the clinic to home because I can answer the phone here, I can do a lot of  things. I can run back and forth, and so I   ve done a lot of the work from  home over the last fifteen years.  Elayne, how has that worked out for you? I mean, some married couples  18  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  could never work in the same business, but you   ve been shoulder to  shoulder, side by side for all that time.  Well twenty   yes, let   s see, how long have we been here? Twenty-six  years? Yes, we   ve been working together for twenty-six years.  A quarter of a century.  Yes, I guess. We do pretty good.  Had to leave the personal issues at home?  Oh, you just never get away from them. I mean, you   re driving down the  highway, and he says,    Oh, by the way, we need to order such and  such.    (Laughter) And expects me to remember it by the time I can write  it down and actually do it. But, yes, you never get away from it really.  Was it special for you to get back to Oklahoma and be near your parents  and everything?  Yes, it was a change, but like we said, we knew where we were coming  and we were      You   d planned that for several years.  We   d planned it for several years. We just kind of felt that we needed to  get back and help out on the farm a little bit. It   s a little bit easier to  manage when you can actually get to see the animals and get to the  facility. We were a lot closer then. We did somewhat of a fair job in  Saint Louis. We came home holidays, but still you had to take time off  work and schedule things just right and make sure the weather didn   t  interfere. That was closer than California, but now we   re on a day-to-day  basis.  I know you   ve been very much engaged in civic and church  organizations. Can you share a little bit of what you   ve done there?  Let   s see. When we moved back here, we did unite with St. Paul   s  United Methodist Church here in Okemah, and I have basically   I   ve  been on administrative council several times in different spots. Right  now, I   m secretary for the administrative council. I   ve worked with the  UMW, United Methodist Women, and am serving as vice president this  year and last year. One of our circles has done a few little extra little  projects as short-term type projects with the church. Let   s see, what else  have I done?  19  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Historical center   I   m just starting to work with that. I kind of got  involved with that when Dad was still alive but didn   t really get into it.  They   re trying to revive the Okfuskee County Historical Society. They  renamed it  History Center  so they can include info from all of the  towns in the county, so we   ve been working on that. I work with the     we used to call it Foster Care Review Board, now it   s called Post-  Adjudication Review Board, where they try to make sure that the  children in foster care are doing as well as they can do and making sure  that their situations are taken care of as best they can. Reunite with the  parents if it   s feasible or put up for adoption and adopted out if that   s the  best plan.  You were a charter member of one of the civic organizations, is that  right?  For the Lion   s Club.  Are you still active in Lion   s Club?  I   m still active. Hopefully I   ll be a little bit more active now that I can  attend more of the functions. For the last two or three years, when Dad  needed twenty-four-hour care, it was not as easy to just make all these  things as they came along.  What a blessing for 104 years.  Yes. Yes, so      Have you remained connected to your family roots and back to  Clearview?  Yes. I don   t have any more family here, but we   re trying very hard to  maintain family. Our family   s relatively small   not nearly as large as  Claud   s family.  Any aunts, uncles, cousins you grew up with?  No. They   re all older, and they   re all deceased now. The cousins and     let   s see, my dad had one sister, and she   s deceased. My mother was an  only child.  And you   re an only child.  And I   m an only child. I have a few cousins, and our family gets  together every   well, it had been every two years, and now a different  aspect ... I went out to Spartanburg, South Carolina, this past year where  20  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  my dad   s folks came from and met some more of the relatives that we  didn   t really know that well. So we   ll be getting together with them in a  couple of years again. So we just kind of stay in touch with people  through reunions, but there   s no one just real close by.  Do you go back to Weleetka High School reunions any?  Unfortunately, no. They usually have their reunions at Thanksgiving  weekend   yes   and when we were away in Saint Louis, we came home  on Thanksgiving, but that was a time that we had to see everybody so we  spent our time visiting relatives at that time. I see some of the people  from time to time. I really need to go back to a reunion. I probably  wouldn   t recognize many people, but      How do you feel about your alma mater now looking back? Is OSU still  special to you?  Yes, I still enjoy going back there and remembering the places, things  that have changed and things that have not changed. Like I said, the  Student Union still looks   the west side of the Student Union still looks  the same as it did back in the 50   s.  So was Walter Starks one of your instructors?  I don   t remember that name.  Of course, Wilton Anderson is still alive and lives in Stillwater, lives in a  nursing home now.  Oh, really?  In a special care facility. Are there things about OSU that you look back  and think of with pride?  I had a very, I guess, a pleasant experience there, and the people that I  met while I was there, I say we stay in touch with them. I had a very  pleasant experience. I did not have a lot of problems, or if I did have  them, I didn   t recognize them (Laughter) as problems. I just      And you   ve stayed close to your alma mater along with Claud, I mean,  you go back to activities of the alumni association.  I try to.  All those banquets through the years and things like that?  21  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Since we   ve been back here. During the times that we were out of state,  it was mainly just looking at the score of the game or something like that  or whatever. When OSU came to San Diego to play a football game  while we were there we went to that. But once we got back in Oklahoma  again, we reconnected, I guess you might say.  What kind of legacy do you think you   ve left as you look back over your  life that you   ll leave?  You know, I really hadn   t thought that much about that. I probably  have   hopefully I can make a difference in someone   s life, but I   m  going to have to get started here pretty soon. (Laughs)  I   m sure you   ve already made a bunch. How do you hope people  remember Elayne Owens Evans?  Well, it depends on who   s telling it. Claud is the outgoing person. He  does the meeting and greeting, but I   m the one that gets him to the place  that he can meet and greet  (Laughter) If it   s left up to him, he would not  be anywhere. (Laughter) No, I am the official scheduler, and I   m the  behind-the-scenes person. I   m the quiet, reserved one, the behind-the-scenes  person   I let him go out and do all that stuff, but      Elayne, did you think about though being a little bit ahead of your time  in the sense that, getting a minor in accounting, majoring in business,  office management   coming from a small rural community, an African-  American student at a major university. Do you ever think about that? I  mean, that you really were a little bit out on the edge there?  I didn   t consider it being out on the edge. I think in my mind I thought,  well, somebody   s always going to need a secretary along the way  wherever you go. I considered nursing. I   m not really sure why I  changed from nursing. I really don   t know. Maybe because OSU didn   t  offer nursing at the time. I think I just really fell in love with OSU. But I  always thought that, if you   re a nurse, you can always get a job wherever  you go   it doesn   t matter. Or if you   re a secretary or have that type of  skills you can get a job wherever you go. So I just kind of built on that  and used that as the foundation, and hopefully I don   t have to go out and  look for another job right away, but I think I could get one.  Elayne, looking forward and backwards of where you are now, where  did you think you   d be when you got out of college? Did you have any  idea that      I probably didn   t think I   d be in Okemah, Oklahoma. I probably didn   t  think of that. Big city was not my dream necessarily. It would have been  22  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  probably a smaller town. But then, you know, we had the farm here and  so it was probably going to be a decision, what do you do with a farm as  an only child? Mother and Daddy worked so hard. His dad started the  farm, and then he farmed. So do you keep it? Do you sell it? What do  you do with it? So it would be nice to kind of keep it and keep it going,  but I really didn   t have any idea how I was going to do that. So it just  kind of fell in place there.  Do you feel good about how your life turned out so far?  So far, so good.  Well Elayne, is there anything we haven   t covered that you   d like to     there are some things I   m sure we missed. Feel free to bring them up  here.  Oh, probably so, but I   ve just led a real quiet (Laughs) behind-the-scenes  type of life.  Thank you very much.  -------  -------
