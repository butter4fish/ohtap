Speaker 1: I am Shawn Wilson with The HistoryMakers.  I'll be the interviewer today.  This is Neculai Burghelea, he's the videographer.
Speaker 2: Very good.
Speaker 1: We are with miss, what would you like me to refer to you as?
Speaker 2: Dee Dee [HistoryMaker Dee Dee Warwick].
Speaker 1: So, we are with Dee Dee.  But we will start by having you state your name for me and spell it out, your full name.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Also your business name, music name.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, if you could just state your name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My name is Delia, D-E-L-I-A.  And speaking of that, let me tell you something.  My nephew just sent me an invitation to his daughter's sweet sixteen party.  And he spelled my name D-E-L-I-A-H, and that's the old southern way to spell it.  But my name is Delia, D-E-L-I-A, and I go as Dee Dee.  And the last name would be Warrick, W-A-R-R-I-C-K, and professionally, W-A-R-W-I-C-K.
Speaker 1: Now, why the difference in the professional spelling and the--your given, your spelling, the family spell--?
Speaker 2: It was an error, an error.  And actually it occurred with Dionne [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick].  When her first record came out, they spelled the English way, as they do in the British nation, W-A-R-W-I-C-K, but they pronounced it War-rick.  We're the only ones that pronounce it War-wick, right?  (Laughter) At any rate, the error occurred with my first record too.  So, it just stuck.
Speaker 1: So--and your name Delia, you said it was a southern name?  Were you named after someone else in the family that you know of?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother's mother [Delia Drinkard].
Speaker 1: Okay, so we'll talk about her.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We'll continue.  Your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: September 25, 19--a very good year (laughter).  And I was born here in New Jersey.
Speaker 1: And today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is what, the 12th?
Speaker 1: September 12, 2005.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And the location of this interview?
Speaker 2: At my home in Orange, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: And your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a singer, entertainer.
Story_ID: 283487

Speaker 2: Chitterlings (laughter) honest to God, with hog maws.

Story_ID: 283488
Speaker 1: You know, this is a conversation, but it's kind of one-sided.  So I will nod and smile--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and not answer so much, just because we want your oral history.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: But we're going to start with your mother.  If you can state your mother's name and spell it out for me?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Arthur Lee [Drinkard] Warrick, and that's A-R-T-H-U-R, Lee, L-E-E, Warrick, W-A-R-R-I-C-K.
Speaker 1: And where was your mother born?
Speaker 2: In Blakely, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Do you know what year she was born?
Speaker 2: Yes, 1920.
Speaker 1: And Blakely, Georgia, did your mother ever talk about growing up in Blakely, Georgia?  What stories did she share with you about growing up in the South?
Speaker 2: She didn't grow up in the South.
Story_ID: 283489
Speaker 1: We were speaking about your mother [Arthur Lee Drinkard Warrick].  She was born in Blakely?
Speaker 2: Blakely.
Speaker 1: Blakely, Georgia.
Speaker 2: Blakely, B-L-A-K-E-L-Y.
Speaker 1: But she grew up in?
Speaker 2: In Newark [New Jersey].  Her father [Nicholas Drinkard] left Georgia, him and his wife [Delia Drinkard], and they moved to Newark.
Speaker 1: Do you know about what year they moved to Newark?
Speaker 2: No, that was well before my recollection.
Speaker 1: Did your mother ever talk about having grown up in the [Great] Depression, because she was born in the '20s [1920s]?  Did that ever, did she ever talk about that?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Well, she talked about the fact that she worked in the Picatinny [Arsenal, Morris County, New Jersey], which was a factory that manufactured gunpowder and made bombs, et cetera for World War I [WWI] and II [World War II, WWII], I guess, yea.
Speaker 1: Where was the Picatinny located?
Speaker 2: In Newark [sic.].
Speaker 1: Was that the name of the factory?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  That's all I know about it, Picatinny.  They made war products, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it was called the Picatinny?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what other stories did your mother share with you about her having grown up in Newark in the '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s]?
Speaker 2: Well, she had schooling there.  She went to South Side High School [Malcolm X Shabazz High School, Newark, New Jersey].  And my mother was awarded a scholarship to go to Juilliard [The Julliard School, New York, New York] herself.  She didn't take it, because she had us kids, you know.  And she was married, and that was that.
Speaker 1: So, what year did your mother marry your father [Mancel Warrick]?
Speaker 2: Oh, my, I don't know (laughter).  I have no clue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any other stories your mother told you about her growing up as a child that stands out for you?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, my mother raised--her and her sister [Marie Drinkard], the one next to her in age--two years younger I think--they raised the rest of the family of seven children.  And she was a teenager more than anything else, because their mother [Delia Drinkard] died at a very young age.  And my mother had to take upon that responsibility.
Speaker 1: So, your mother actually became--
Speaker 2: Mother.
Speaker 1: Mother.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: For her sisters and brothers.  How many sisters and brothers did she have to raise?
Speaker 2: What, seven?  No, five, five; it would be five excluding my aunt, as I said, that helped her raise the children.
Speaker 1: So how many children, how many siblings did your mother have?  And we spoke about this off-camera.  In total it was?
Speaker 2: Including her, it would be seven.
Speaker 1: Seven.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But her mother had had fourteen?
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: And seven lived?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Do you know the names of the seven that lived?  Can you recite any of--?
Speaker 2: I don't.  The only one that I really know about, his name was Aaron [sic.].
Speaker 1: And what was Aaron like?
Speaker 2: I don't know him (laughter).  I mean, he was before my birth.
Speaker 1: Now, was it a musical family?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, definitely.
Speaker 1: So, even the sisters and brothers that you didn't know--your mother-- they were a musical family?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, they lived very short periods of time.  There was a set of twins that died almost immediately.  And the other four or five would live very short periods of time.
Speaker 1: Now, your mother raised them here in Newark, New Jersey?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 283490
Speaker 1: And then your mother [Arthur Lee Drinkard Warrick] herself was a singer?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So let's talk about, talk about you as a child seeing your mother as a singer.
Speaker 2: Oh, it was wonderful.  Because the Drinkards, which she founded as a gospel group, it was first called the Drinkard Jubillaires, and they'd rehearse all the time at our house.
Speaker 1: Can you spell Drinkard for me?
Speaker 2: D-R-I-N-K-A-RD.
Speaker 1: And what year was the group formed, do you know?
Speaker 2: I don't know, probably in the, well, probably in--well, they sang all their lives, you know, living together.  And being that my grandfather [Elzae Warrick] was a minister, they were all in the church in the choir.  And my mother's father [Nicholas Drinkard] was a deacon.  And my grandfather, like I said, was the minister.  So, we were always in church.
Speaker 1: So, religion was a big part of your mother's life, as well as yours?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, definitely.
Speaker 1: So what type--what do you know about the Drinkards?  Who was the group made up of?
Speaker 2: It was made up of my two uncles, Larry [Drinkard] and Nick [Nicholas Drinkard]; and my aunt Ann [Anne Drinkard]; Cissy [Emily Drinkard Houston; Cissy Houston]; my Aunt Reebie [Marie Drinkard], and my mother.  And my mother adopted another daughter sometime down the road, her name is Judy [Judy Clay].
Speaker 1: Now, Judy, I read was the oldest of the siblings.  Is that correct?
Speaker 2: No, Reebie was the oldest.
Speaker 1: Reebie.
Speaker 2: No.  Mama was the oldest of the girls.  And Willie [William Drinkard], my Uncle Willie, didn't sing.  He could sing, but he didn't sing with them, was the oldest of the family.
Speaker 1: So, why did she adopt Judy?  Why did your mother adopt Judy?
Speaker 2: She needed adopting.  She was in, she was living in New York [New York], and having a bad time of it.  She had moved to New York from North Carolina, from Fayetteville.  And she just needed somebody to guide her.  And my mother took it upon herself--which sometimes me and Dionne [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick] were not very happy about, actually (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, your mother had you and Dionne?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: I mean, I'll, we'll get into that.  And then she adopted Judy?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now Judy, was Judy related to you in any way?  Was she a cousin (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not at all.
Speaker 1: --of somebody else's, or she was totally--
Speaker 2: Totally a stranger.
Speaker 1: A stranger that your mother--now, how did your mother come upon Judy to adopt her?  It speaks to the character of your mother being a great woman.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  She, Judy was singing with Bishop [Alvin A.] Childs in New York City.  And it was a sanctified church [Faith Temple Church of God in Christ; Childs Memorial Temple Church of God in Christ, New York, New York], and Judy was a good singer.  And my mother just took to her, and took her and put her in the group as a matter of fact.  So she became a Drinkard Singer.
Speaker 1: So, the Drinkards were all related, all brothers and sisters, blood brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Except for Judy?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Who was an adopted relative?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, the Drinkards performed where?
Speaker 2: Mostly churches, the larger churches.  They did smaller churches, but mostly the larger metropolitan churches.
Speaker 1: Now, when did the Drinkards get their big break?
Speaker 2: During the time of the Newport Jazz Festival.  I'm trying to think of what year that was.  I think it was during the late '50s [1950s].  And they were invited by Joe Bostick to go to the Newport Jazz Festival, to be the first gospel group that ever performed there.  And they did an album, recorded a live album from there.  And they recorded the songs that they put on their regular album, from using the jazz festival as a springboard.  And RCA Victor [RCA Records, New York, New York] signed them.  It was amazing at that time.
Speaker 1: And RCA Victor signed them.  And when did they meet Mahalia Jackson, and what role did she play in helping develop them?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, Mahalia was actually the headliner at the Newport Jazz Festival along with Alex Bradford and the Back Home Choir.  And Mahalia put them on programs with her.  The venues that she did, they would open up her program for her.
Speaker 1: So what were they, what were they like, from your eyes as a child?  And the sound, what was that sound like coming from them?
Speaker 2: Believe me, it was incredible.  I mean it was so convicted and so real.  And they loved each other, and it showed, you know.  And they would blend perfectly.
Speaker 1: Now, were gospel groups at that time, was it commonplace to have a family singing as a gospel group, or were they something that was relatively new?
Speaker 2: No, it was rather commonplace, actually.
Speaker 1: And they'd come out of the church?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 283491
Speaker 1: What church did your [paternal] grandfather, what church was your grandfather the pastor of?
Speaker 2: My grandfather was pastor of St. Luke Methodist Church [St. Luke's Methodist Church; St. Luke A.M.E Church, Newark, New Jersey].  He was an A.M.E minister, African Methodist Episcopal.  And he traveled from church to church, and built up churches.  And then they'd transfer him to another church, and he'd do the same thing over and over and over again.  So, he was a hard, hard worker.
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [Arthur Lee Drinkard Warrick] ever tell you stories about your grandfather being a pastor?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you have the opportunity to meet him yourself?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I did.
Speaker 1: And what was he like?
Speaker 2: Oh, he was--
Speaker 1: Now, let's get his name, first of all.
Speaker 2: His name was Elzae, E-L-Z-A-E, Warrick.  I don't know his middle name.  I think his name was--that's what it was, Elzae.  And yes, I did, I went to his church.
Speaker 1: What was his church like?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was a comfortable church, you know, as big as a small house when he first came up with doing the A.M.E, transferring and building it up.  As a matter of fact, St. Luke is one of the biggest churches in this city, in the City of Newark [Jersey], that is, because of his building on it.   And we went to his church.  We took Bible studies and learned how to knit (laughter) and different activities like that, sew and knit.  It was very homebody-ish.
Speaker 1: So what was the address of that church, do you remember?  And it still exists today, so it would be really important.
Speaker 2: I do; oddly enough, I do.  It was 134 Charleston Street [ph.], in Newark.  It's incredible.
Speaker 1: And your grandfather is the founding member of that church?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, are there any other stories you can tell me about your grandfather's church and the way he ran, the way the church was ran?
Speaker 2: Well, he had the normal faculty like deacons, deaconesses, missionaries.  As a matter of fact his wife [Juanita Warrick], my grandmother, was one of his main missionaries.  But he was a great preacher, he could truly preach.
Speaker 1: What were revivals like?
Speaker 2: Oh, interesting, very interesting.  We used to sing a lot of meters.  We called them common meters.  And it's like meter, m-e-t-e-r.  And it was common to everybody, like the slaves used to do in the fields.  Somebody would holler, (singing) "I know the Lord will make a way," you know, and it would go on like that.  And any phrasing that would come to mind, they would do that in our church.
Story_ID: 283492
Speaker 1: We are continuing, but we're going to start talking about meters.  And it was spelled, m-e-t-e-r?
Speaker 2: E-r.
Speaker 1: Where did that term come from?
Speaker 2: It came from, well, the tempo is a meter, you know, like in music.  And the tempo which they would use--the slaves, I'm talking about--passing along messages to each other, and warnings to each other as to what was going on.  And they'd just go out and somebody would sing a phrase, and then the whole cotton field or tobacco field would repeat the phrase so it would get around to everybody, and everybody would get the message.  And they said it was a common meter, c-o-m-m-o-n, common among blacks.
Speaker 1: And then that later came into the church?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: As a way to do what?
Speaker 2: To do the same thing, literally, to set up an idea of what was coming.  It was like before we started our regular services, you'd do devotional; that's what they called it.  And people would start a meter, and the whole church would fall in behind it.  It was a wonderful thing.
Story_ID: 283493
Speaker 1: So we were talking about the Drunkards?
Speaker 2: The Drunkards (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Not Drunkards, the Drinkards (laughter).
Speaker 2: That has happened a number of times, actually (laughter).
Speaker 1: Sorry, the Drinkards.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, they were in, they started in your grandfather's church [St. Luke's Methodist Church; St. Luke A.M.E Church, Newark, New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: And how old were they when the group formed?
Speaker 2: Um--
Speaker 1: Were they teenagers?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Children?
Speaker 2: I think my mom [Arthur Lee Drinkard Warrick] must have had me when she was in her twenties, I think, yes.  So she would have been twenty-four or twenty-five, somewhere in that area.
Speaker 1: So they went off to Newport [Jazz Festival], they got a contract with RCA Records [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And they made their first record?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Can you remember what life was like for you and your mom and your family when they made that first record?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was thrilling, you know.  Actually, it was more thrilling than I can express, the fact that they were the first gospel group to ever go to Newport.  We thought it was a natural occurrence, because I mean they were so wonderful, you know, literally.  But they were, and that was quite a milestone.  And they're in a lot of history books at the Smithsonian Institute [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.], as well as myself (laughter).
Story_ID: 283494
Speaker 1: So, we were talking about your mother [Arthur Lee Drinkard Warrick] and her side of the family.  Let's talk about your father.  What was your father's name?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Mancel Leland Warrick.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Mancel, M-A-N-C-E-L, Leland, L-E-L-A-N-D.
Speaker 1: Now, where was your father from?
Speaker 2: My dad was Florida, St. Petersburg, Florida.
Speaker 1: Do you know what year your father was born?
Speaker 2: No, I'm not sure.  Well, he was like eight years older than my mother.  So, it would have been 1911, yeah, about that.
Speaker 1: What was your father like?  What did he--let's start--what did he look like?
Speaker 2: Oh, he was gorgeous, a beautiful, beautiful man (laughter).  He looked Indian [Native American].  He was a very tan man, of high color with beautiful hair, very tall, 6'2", 6'3", something like that.  And--
Speaker 1: You said he looked Indian.  Was he Indian?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was.
Speaker 1: Was he mixed?
Speaker 2: He was part, what do you call them?  My mom, she comes from the Blackfoot, and my dad came from the Seminoles, the Florida Indians, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your mother also is part Indian?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did they ever talk about their Indian ancestry, either one of them?
Speaker 2: Not at all.
Speaker 1: Not at all?
Speaker 2: Uh-uh.  Because my, well, my mom's part of the family were--you know my dad--my mother's father's [Nicholas Drinkard] part of the family, the Drinkards, come from Dutch, it was Dutch and Indian.  You know, when they had that big war, I guess they got together some kind of way, and the bloodline went on down to the Drinkards.  I think that is a Dutch name, as a matter of fact.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your father--what was your father's--did you know your father's parents?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: What were their names, and what were they like?
Speaker 2: My grandfather, I think I mentioned his name is Elzea [sic. Elzae Warrick], E-L-Z-E-A.
Speaker 1: Oh, so Elzea was your father's father?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my grandmother's name was Juanita [Warrick], whom I'm named after somewhat.  I'm named after both of my grandmothers, on my mother's and my father's side.
Speaker 1: Delia is the name that came--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was Juanita?
Speaker 2: Juanita, that's my middle name--Mae, M-A-E, which everybody was a Mae during that time (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, can you remember any stories that your father, that your father told about his life as a child growing up in Florida.  Did he grow up in Florida?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, not actually.  They moved north too, to Newark [New Jersey], long before I would know about.
Speaker 1: Did they ever talk about why they were moving north?
Speaker 2: The pressure of the South, actually.  And my father's father was a minister, an A.M.E [African Methodist Episcopal] minister who was constantly shifted from place to place.  And he ended up in Newark.
Speaker 1: Now, we know that you--that he had the religious message in his sermons.  What were some of the social messages that he was preaching to the people at the time?  Can you remember?
Speaker 2: My grandfather preached mostly from the Bible, the books of the Bible.  He didn't put out any messages of a social level like that, as they do today.  In other words, in that time ministers preached the Bible.  They didn't involve themselves socially, because they didn't have that to do.  I don't think that they thought they had that to do.  Because parents were so different at that time, you know.  Parents were strict.  You had to go to church.  You could not go to the movies on Sunday.  You couldn't buy a pair of stockings on Sunday.  That's the way my mother raised us.
Speaker 1: What else could you not do on Sundays?  Because I know it's a big part of the African American heritage, Sundays.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What could you not do on Sundays because you were not permitted to?
Speaker 2: Well, like I say, you couldn't go to the movies.  There was no activity.  It was the Lord's Day, and we just had to be still.  You know, we could go out and play, in particular in the summer.  It was too hot to be in the house, and we'd go sit on the porch.  There was no real play.  You know, we couldn't play jacks.  We couldn't jump rope, you know.  We couldn't play hide and seek.  There was no playing.  It was res-, a day of rest between you and the Lord.
Story_ID: 283495
Speaker 1: Now, when did your mother [Arthur Lee Drinkard Warrick] and father [Mancel Warrick], when did they meet and marry?  Or do you know the story of how they met?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I just don't know that.
Speaker 1: Do you know what year they married?
Speaker 2: No, I really don't.
Speaker 1: But they met here in Newark [New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then what year--then they started their family.  So, Dionne [HistoryMaker Dionne Warick] was first?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: She was the first one, and you're the second born?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What were--
Speaker 2: And we had a brother as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was your--I didn't know you had a brother.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was your brother's name?
Speaker 2: His name was Mancel, he was a Warrick, too.  He was not a junior, though.  He was Mancel Leland, that's all.
Speaker 1: Now your brother, I didn't read much, I didn't find much about him.  Was he a singer as well?
Speaker 2: No, not at all.  He was sports--football and baseball.  As a matter of fact, he was killed in a car accident just before he turned twenty, twenty-one, yeah.  And he was offered a contract with the [New York] Mets, with the [New York] Jets, and a whole lot of places.  Yeah, he was very athletic.
Story_ID: 283496
Speaker 1: So, let's talk about your childhood then.  What are some of your earliest memories of growing up in Newark [New Jersey] with your mother [Arthur Lee Drinkard Warrick] and father [Mancel Warrick]?
Speaker 2: I got to get back to church.  Church, church, church.
Speaker 1: Let's do it.
Speaker 2: Because we lived right--the church was right in back of the house.  We actually walked through an alley just to get to church.  And so we were constantly there doing Bible study and prayer meetings, and not much singing, because we were just children at that time.  And my grandfather [Elzae Warrick] and grandmother [Juanita Warrick] lived on the first floor, and we lived on the second floor.  So it was, you know, it was just church.  And being involved with the Drinkards, their rehearsals, school, you know.  What do I remember? Well, I had a happy childhood.
Story_ID: 283497
Speaker 1: What are some of the sights and sounds or smells that would remind you of your childhood?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, okay (laughter).  Greens, cooking greens.  You know, I mean that has a distinctive smell of its own.  And you know when somebody's cooking greens and frying chicken (laughter).  That's one of the main things I can remember.
Story_ID: 283498
Speaker 1: So what do you remember about your school, like first grade?  Where did you go to school?
Speaker 2: I went to Lincoln Grammar School [Lincoln Avenue School, Orange, New Jersey] here in--we had moved to East Orange [New Jersey] by that time.  I went to grammar school there, and then I went to junior high school at Vernon L. Davey [Junior] High School [East Orange, New Jersey].  As a matter of fact, Lincoln School is now called the Dionne Warwick School of Entrepreneurship [Dionne Warwick Institute of Economics and Entrepreneurship, East Orange, New Jersey], which I'm very proud of.  Then I went to East Orange High School [East Orange Campus High School, East Orange, New Jersey] where I studied most of my--well, I was in the choral group of course.  I was going to be a doctor, but music called me, I had to answer (laughter).
Story_ID: 283499
Speaker 1: When did you receive your calling to music?  At what age?
Speaker 2: I must have been like thirteen, something like that.
Speaker 1: And how did it happen?
Speaker 2: Well, Dionne [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick] was studying the piano, and I was studying violin.  And everybody hated me, because you know how that can sound if you can't play, you know (laughter).  So, my mother [Arthur Lee Drinkard Warrick] taught me my first song, 'It is No Secret What God Can Do.'  And I used to sing really soft and light.  And my Aunt Cissy [Emily Drinkard Houston], Cissy Houston, she said, "Sing out, Dee Dee [HistoryMaker Dee Dee Warwick], sing out, damn it" (laughter).  I haven't stopped since.  I sing out all the time now.
Speaker 1: Now, because there were so many musicians around you, it seems almost natural that you'd sing.  But it wasn't.  You were--
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't something that I really wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Now, why did your parents [Arthur Lee Drinkard Warrick and Mancel Warrick] decide that you, that everyone should learn an instrument?  Dionne was playing piano, you were playing violin.  Where did that come from?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it was just to give us the initiative to learn something more outside of just educational things.  They knew we had talents, and they let us be exposed to learning something about them.
Speaker 1: Well, as far as violin, and violinists, too, had you been exposed to those who also played the violin?  What type of music did you listen to?
Speaker 2: Well, I listened to a lot of, what do you call it?  Middle of the road.  And I could hear the strings, that's what my ears tuned in to.  And consequently, I decided that's what I wanted to play.  I'll tell you a funny thing.  I used to think that all that music came out of the baton (laughter).  I asked my mother, "Would you buy me one of those sticks (laughter)?"  So, you know, but like I say, they hated me for playing violin.  So I just gave it up, because I was being persecuted (laughter).
Story_ID: 283500
Speaker 1: We are continuing on tape two.  What we were talking about is you playing the violin.  What I want to sort of segue into a little bit, is that your family must have been middle-class in order for you and Dionne [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick] to take piano lessons, for you to play the violin.  What sort of community would you say you grew up in?
Speaker 2: I would say, well, a little less than middle-class, I would say.  But we were privileged.  My father [Mancel Warrick] made good money, you know.
Speaker 1: We never talked about what your father did.  What did your father do?
Speaker 2: My dad was a Pullman Porter.  And he worked the streamliner, the Silver Streak, or something like that.  And he made a lot of money.  And he went from Newark--New York [New York], rather--and Newark [New Jersey] all the way to California and back.  So, you know, he had movie stars on the train, and they would tip well, you know.  If you'd be a good porter, you'd get good tips.  And he did.
Speaker 1: And he was good-looking.
Speaker 2: Oh, a fabulous looking man (laughter).  I mean he was an extraordinary looking man.
Speaker 1: Now, we didn't talk about what your mother [Arthur Lee Drinkard Warrick] looks like.  Let's just add that in.  What, physically what does your mother look like?
Speaker 2: My mother was not very, very tall.  She was like maybe 5'1", something like that, a beautiful woman, petite, beautiful legs, long hair.  She was a fantastic looking woman.
Story_ID: 283501
Speaker 1: So your father [Mancel Warrick] being a Pullman Porter, what stories did--did he bring stories--what stories did he tell you about his job?
Speaker 2: Well, he--
Speaker 1: You talked about the movie stars.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. He had the special car for Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] when he was running for president, I Like Ike.  And he brought us home souvenirs from that, buttons and hats, and all of that stuff.
Speaker 1: So, he worked that car?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, did he talk about--
Speaker 2: He was requested to work it.
Speaker 1: He was requested?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How did that come about?
Speaker 2: Well, he just had a manner, you know.  I mean he was courteous and he was punctual, and he was a gentleman.  So, you know, they wanted Speedy, they called him.
Speaker 1: What did they call him?
Speaker 2: Speedy.
Speaker 1: Speedy?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because he was--
Speaker 1: So he worked with Eisenhower?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Eisenhower and Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon].
Speaker 1: He worked with Nixon?
Speaker 2: No, not on his campaign, but when he was with Eisenhower as vice president.
Speaker 1: Eisenhower?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what--did he talk about--I mean what was it like for you having your father on the president's train?
Speaker 2: It was fantastic.  My dad would bring home, my father brought my mother [Arthur Lee Drinkard Warrick] home a Rolex.  This was before we really knew what a Rolex was, it was such an exclusive thing.  And I think it was given to him by Hedy Lamarr, back to the movie star thing.  And I still have it; my mother gave it to me.  And my dad would bring us--we had sewing classes in school, and we had to supply the material.  And my dad would bring home gabardine to the max, to the teeth, to the point where my sewing teacher got jealous of me because of the material (laughter).  You know, we were just so special, my father thought, and that we deserved to learn how to do that on a good piece of material.
Speaker 1: What did your father tell you about race?  About--what did he tell you about yourself, about you being black?  Because he was a Pullman Porter, he must have seen at least discrimination.  Or did he?
Speaker 2: I'm sure he did.  But he never mentioned anything like that to us.  You know, I mean it wasn't about that.  My father was a self-educated man.  He ended up with a degree in accounting, a certified public accountant.  And he taught us that anything you want to do, you can do it.  And he instilled that in us and ensured us that that was true to the point where I remember when we didn't feed the dog and didn't give him water, he said, "You're going to sit down, both of you, and write a thousand times, I will feed the dog and give him fresh water every day," (laughter).  I'm telling you.  And my sister [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick], she was smarter than me.  She was so slick.  She wrote it real, real big, and just had a bunch of papers (laughter).  I wrote it neatly, and I ended up sitting up there two hours.  And my father said, "You can go.  Go."  But that's the kind of guy he was, you know.  He'd take you to your max and let you know, you know, "This is what you did wrong.  Do it right; do it right the first time."
Speaker 1: So, did he talk about how Hedy Lamarr came to give him that Rolex watch?
Speaker 2: Yes, by just being a gentleman, just being a gentleman to her, you know, and treating her--you know, movie stars were quite something to do in those days.  They were quote, unquote movie stars and they would, you know, get out of their characters and have a sip here and a sip there (laughter).  And my father made sure they were all right, you know.  And they trusted him.  He didn't steal from them, you know.  He didn't criticize them; he had no opinion.  He just did his work and came home.  Because he was away from us so much, you know, going from here to California and working there, and back here.  It took up a lot of time.  You know, he'd be on the road sometimes for months, and we'd miss him terribly.  And I remember one Christmas, he couldn't get home.  And he went to the penny arcade and made a record for us, you know, those little twenty-five cents records, and sent it to us.  That was quite something.
Speaker 1: Did he, did your father sing as well?
Speaker 2: No, no, he didn't sing.
Speaker 1: What was the, tell me about the penny arcade record.  I don't know about that.
Speaker 2: He spoke to us, he just talked to us.  The penny arcade used to have--you'd pay fifty cents or twenty-five cents and you could make your own record.  They had a master wheel and a cutter, you know.  And you just put it on there, and say what you had to say.  A lot of the war guys at war did that, too, sent the same kind of messages to their families.
Story_ID: 283502
Speaker 1: Speaking of the war, did any of your family members go off to any of the wars?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Who did?
Speaker 2: My Uncle Hansom [Drinkard].
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Hansom, H-A-N-S-O-N [sic.].  He went, he was in the Marines [U.S. Marine Corps].  My Uncle Willie [William Drinkard] was in the [U.S.] Army, and my great-uncles were in the [U.S.] Navy, two of them, yeah.  And they all survived it, which was a wonderful thing.
Speaker 1: So, let's just keep moving forward.  We talked about--are there any other stories you can tell me about your parents and their ancestry, about the Indian mix in the family?  Anything we may have left out?
Speaker 2: Well, my grandfather was from Missouri.  And he was like, that's where the Blackfoot comes in, the Blackfoot Indians [Native Americans].  He came from Missouri, and of course they moved to Florida.  Okay, I think he was born in Florida.
Speaker 1: This is your father's grandfather?  This is Elzae [Warrick]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father's father, yeah, Elzae.
Speaker 1: Elzae, okay.
Speaker 2: An odd name, but distinctive, you know.  I don't really know that much about that part.
Story_ID: 283503
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this.  Remember when you were in Newark [New Jersey] before you moved to Orange [New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: What street did you live on?
Speaker 2: On Charleston Street [sic.] where the church [St. Luke's Methodist Church; St. Luke A.M.E Church, Newark, New Jersey] was, you know.  The church was in the back, and we lived in the front part of the house.
Speaker 1: What was the rest of that neighborhood like?  Describe it for me.
Speaker 2: It was the Third Ward.  It was lower class, not low class, but I mean not middle class.  I mean, people didn't really have very much money other than going to school.  That's what my family did, you know, all the children graduated from high school.  And like I said, my mother [Arthur Lee Drinkard Warrick] was offered a scholarship to Juilliard [The Julliard School, New York, New York].  And one of my uncles, he just started playing piano one day, just sat down and started playing (laughter).  That's what I really remember.
Speaker 1: Now, your mother, when she was offered the scholarship to Juilliard, it was for her voice?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mother was a lyric soprano, a very beautiful voice.
Story_ID: 283504
Speaker 1: Can you remember any teachers that made a big impression on you?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's a good question.  My health education teacher, Miss Gentis, G-E-N-T-I-S, she had an impact on me that I have carried with me to this day.  Miss Gentis, she taught me well, and she made me a punctual person.  I'm pretty much on time anywhere I go, because she insisted on that.  I had to do detention with her sometimes, and she told me to come to class at 8:00 instead of 8:15.  And sometimes I'd get there a minute to eight.  She says, "You'll have to come tomorrow" (laughter).  I'd get there at two minutes after eight, and she'd say, "You have to come tomorrow."  And she kept doing it until it sunk into my head.  She said, "And don't walk through my door, the door of my class, until it's eight o'clock.  And walk in here at eight o'clock."  And I did it (laughter). She learned me (unclear) (laughter).
Story_ID: 283505
Speaker 1: So when you were a child, Emmett Till, the Emmett Till case happened in Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you, do you remember hearing about that as a kid?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, very much so.
Speaker 1: What did you hear?
Speaker 2: It was a very angry period.  Everybody got very angry about that, because it was just an ugly thing.
Speaker 1: And this is 1955.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  I must have been what?  Somewhere around eight or ten, something like that.  And when they killed him, it was just outrageous.  It was the most outrageous thing anybody ever heard of.  Because we weren't aware that this was going on in the South, because we were never in the South.  We were born and raised right here in New Jersey.  And it was rather common in the South, you know, people lynching people.  But we thought that that day had passed.  You know, we'd heard about it of course during slavery times, and in history, et cetera, but we thought that day had totally passed.  And that was what was so outrageous about Emmett.  It's a bad thing.
Story_ID: 283506
Speaker 1: So when you were in high school, or when you, when were--the health education teacher, what school were in, elementary school or high school?
Speaker 2: I was in high school [East Orange High School; East Orange Campus High School, East Orange, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: In high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: At what point did you form the Gospel--
Speaker 2: The Gospelaires.
Speaker 1: The Gospelaires, what year was that?
Speaker 2: Oh, really--I don't know.  It must have been in the late '50s [1950s], early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Who was in that group (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, actually it was before--no.  Yeah, about that time, about that--'59 [1959] or '62 [1962], something like that.
Speaker 1: Who was in that group, and how did the group form?
Speaker 2: My Uncle Larry [Drinkard], he formed that group for us.  It was Dionne [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick], myself, Myrna Smith, who is one of the Sweet Inspirations now, and Sylvia Shemwell, who was also a member of the Sweet Inspirations.  And Myrna's brother, John Utley, he was just a singer.
Speaker 1: So you, when that group formed, you were a teenager?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: But you'd discovered your voice, and Cissy [Emily Drinkard Houston; Cissy Houston] telling you sing out.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what did you sing?  Were you soprano, alto?
Speaker 2: I would say soprano at that time, yeah.  I could still go soprano if I have to.
Speaker 1: So it was the Gospelaires?
Speaker 2: The Gospelaires.
Speaker 1: Gospel--
Speaker 2: Like aires a-i-r-e-s.
Speaker 1: So, the Gospelaires?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What year did you perform at the Apollo Theater [New York, New York] and meet the person who would give you--to help the group?
Speaker 2: Well, when we performed at the Apollo, it must have been--we went in there with my mother's [Arthur Lee Drinkard Warrick] group, the Drinkard Singers, who were in there with Alex Bradford, Professor Alex Bradford, and he had them on the show.  And along with them was the Imperial Gospel Singers from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And one of our songs we sang was their song, their hit record.  Well, we had amateur night, and we went on as amateurs.  And I tell you, my knees were like water, because I'm the lead singer, right?  (Laughter) You know, I'm standing the wings, and I said, "I'm going to fall down" (laughter).  But we did it.  We did their song in their face, and did it excellently.  We won.  We won that night, absolutely.
Speaker 1: And then what happened?
Speaker 2: And then we got called out for background sessions.
Story_ID: 283507
Speaker 1: So you go backstage and you meet someone.  Who did you meet?
Speaker 2: Well, actually the man who came to see the Drinkard Singers, to do a background for Nappy Brown, the blues singer.
Speaker 1: Who is Nappy Brown?
Speaker 2: Nappy Brown was a big-time blues singer, like Muddy Waters, or like that.  He was really a very popular man.  And the Drinkards couldn't come, of course, because they were on the stage doing the show at the Apollo [Theater, New York, New York].  So, they sent us.  And from that point we met Ozzie Cadena, who was an engineer at Savoy Records [Newark, New Jersey], which was where Nappy did his recordings.  And they kept hiring us.  We did Sam the Man Taylor, we did Dave Brubeck, we did--oh my Lord, so many--Herbie Mann, a lot of things, yeah.
Speaker 1: So that was the start of your professional career?  You were being paid?
Speaker 2: It was the beginning of our background singing professionally, yeah.
Speaker 1: So who was all the background singers at that time?  It was you--
Speaker 2: Well, it was me, Dionne [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick], Myrna [Smith], Estelle--I forgot to mention her, Estelle Brown--and Sylvia [Shemwell] again.  Basically, that was the group.
Speaker 1: And singing--what sort of--what is a background singer?
Speaker 2: Background singers supply a feel or a lick, you know.  A lick is like (singing), you know, we support the lead singer.  And the lead singer can respond off of us.  So, we fill in where the gaps are, backing them up (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you're at Savoy, and you're doing a lot of backup work.  About what year did it really take off for you?
Speaker 2: Sixty-one [1961], '61 [1961] or '62 [1962], somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: Now, what happened in '61 [1961] that made it take off?
Speaker 2: Well, they had heard of us, and New York [New York] called.  Who was that who called us?  I can't remember who exactly that was.  Maybe Atlantic Records [New York, New York]--Jerry Wexler, Bert Berns, or [Steve] Greenberg at Mercury Records.  And he wanted us to do something with [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones at Mercury Records with what's that girl's name?  Connie Francis, and Elvis [Presley].  So it just snowballed from there, and we made a lot of money, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, when you were--when you were a background singer and you started to make money, who were, who were the influential players, and the type of music you were singing?  Who were people that made a difference?
Speaker 2: Well, I say again, Jerry Wexler, Bert Berns.
Speaker 1: Now, who was Jerry Wexler?
Speaker 2: Jerry Wexler was the owner of Atlantic Records.
Speaker 1: So you started off right away not just singing for black singers?
Speaker 2: No, I sang for everybody.
Speaker 1: You sang for everybody?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, there was never really any real discrimination?
Speaker 2: No, there really wasn't, there really wasn't.  They treated us wonderfully, you know.  They looked out for us and they paid us very well, as I say.
Speaker 1: What happened when you went on the, did you go on the road touring with anyone?
Speaker 2: No, we stayed right here and commuted, commuted in New York.
Story_ID: 283508
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Arthur Lee Drinkard Warrick] and father [Mancel Warrick] think when you made the transition from gospel music, the Gospelaires, and you started to perform background for people like Elvis [Presley]?  Did that, was that difficult for them?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was difficult because they wanted us to sing gospel.  We were very good, and they wanted us to continue to sing gospel.  But you know, we had our own road to travel, and that's what we did.
Speaker 1: What was appealing about moving?  Was there something appealing about stepping away from gospel music?  Why did you want to leave gospel music?
Speaker 2: It was literally the money, literally the money.  Gospel was not paying like it is today.  I believed at that time--we all believed that one day it would.  And it has come to fruition, you know, big time.  But it was a better way to make a living.  And since we didn't continue with all the music studies--and we had what we had naturally.  It just came out, you know, creatively.  They liked what we did, and they just kept hiring us.
Story_ID: 283509
Speaker 1: So what year did you decide to take on a solo career of your own, and how did that come about?
Speaker 2: You know, that's weird, because I didn't decide it.  These two guys named Ben Malarkey [ph.] and Mike Devilia [ph.], they heard me.  I used to do demo records, which is like when writers write a song, they get a singer to come and sing it for another artist.  And I used to do those by the thousands.  Like I say, when we were in the studio, I would work from ten in the morning to two in the morning doing background and doing demos.  And they heard a demo I did, and they went and made a deal with Jubilee Records [New York, New York].  They said, "We've got a deal for you.  You've got to sing by yourself."  So, it worked.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the first--what was happening with Dionne's [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick] career at the time?
Speaker 2: Dionne had just gotten a deal with Burt Bacharach and David [Hal David].  And they used her for the songs that they were writing.  Because nobody else could have done those songs, and they still can't.  Those are very difficult songs that Dionne sings.  Myself, well, I was always an R&B singer, not that I couldn't do the other, which I ended up doing "Alfie," you know, I mean a lot of good songs.  That's about basically what would happen to get my career started.  And I had--well, before Dionne had a hit record, I had a number one record with 'I Want to Be With You' and 'We're Doing Fine.'  So, you never know.
Speaker 1: Now, who wrote those two songs for you?
Speaker 2: "I Want to Be With You" comes from the play, 'Golden Boy' [Clifford Odets].
Speaker 1: And that was a Broadway hit?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: That was '63 [sic.].  And 'We're Doing Fine' was written by--I can't think of everybody's name--but those writers were very good.
Speaker 1: And 'We're Doing Fine' was the first big--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was that your first big--
Speaker 2: No, the first big one was 'I Want to Be With You.'  It became an unfortunate thing, because the writer of the song got angry with my producer and myself because we didn't use anything but that line.  You know, we didn't use the rest of his lyrics, and he got very upset and he had them pull the record off the market.  So, they just flipped it over and starting playing 'We're Doing Fine' which turned out to be a big, big hit for me too.
Story_ID: 283510
Speaker 1: Now, what year did you go to Detroit [Michigan] and start--I mean you were making records here in New York [New York], and then you met two producers and you--they decide they want you to go to Detroit.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What year was that, and what was Detroit like?
Speaker 2: That was the year of the big mistake (laughter).  That was a mistake on my part.  Detroit was Motown [Records], period.  As a matter of fact, I recorded at Motown.  But it wasn't my style (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Before you go any further, tell me about Motown and recording at Motown.  Motown is an icon.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh yes.  Well, I had done demos for Tamla [Records; Motown Records, Detroit, Michigan], which was Motown in New York.  So, they were well-aware of me.  And it just didn't work for me.  You know, their sound, their rhythms, they were different from ours that we used on the East Coast.
Speaker 1: What was your first meeting with [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy like?
Speaker 2: Oh, very different; very, very different.  As a matter of fact, I had met Berry when he was first writing, like I said, on Tamla Records, which I used to work a lot in the Brill Building in New York.  And Tamla was right downstairs from where I used to work, upstairs with [Jerry] Leiber and [Mike] Stoller.  And I met him there at Tamla, and he wanted to sign me.  And I went to lunch with him and with the manager I had, and they offered me five hundred dollars a week for the rest of my life.  I said, "I have to go to the ladies' room."  And I left, I went home (laughter).  I mean I'm making like $250,000, $200,000 a year doing background.  And he's going to offer me $500 a week?  I didn't know what he was talking about.  So, I left.  So that stayed right there.  And well, not too long ago at the Pioneer Awards he was there, I saw him there.  He said, "I still want you to sing for me," you know, which was very complimentary.
Speaker 1: So, the Motown, at that time--talk to me about--you know, there were certain--there was a particular sound coming from Motown in the '60s [1960s].  You had the opportunity to work with some of the Motown artists.  Who were they?
Speaker 2: Well, I worked with, well, I worked with The Supremes and Martha and the Vandellas.
Speaker 1: What was it like working with The Supremes?
Speaker 2: Well, it was rather strange.  Because see, we were East Coast, and they were Detroit.  It was something like what the rappers are going through now.  But it was not, it wasn't violent.  It's just that we said, "You are you, and we are we" (laughter).  And that was the whole story with that.  We didn't mix that well.
Story_ID: 283511
Speaker 1: Aretha [Franklin] was a good friend of mine, is still a good friend, and her sister and brother.  And Reverend [C.L.] Franklin, her father, was a good friend of mine.
Speaker 2: Now, did her--because her father was a reverend, did he know your father [Mancel Warrick]?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: They did not know each other?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Aretha you met in what year, and started to do background work with her?
Speaker 1: That must have been '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: You met her as a friend first, or as a musician?
Speaker 1: As a musician.  No, I met her as a friend first, I see what you mean.  We were, Dionne [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick] and her are about the same age, you know, and we would hang out together.
Speaker 2: Oh good, hang out, that's a good place.  Where did you hang out?  What--
Speaker 1: You really want to know?  (Laughter) Well, we'd hang out at Sugar Ray Robinson's club [Sugar Hill Supper Club] in New York [New York].  Sugar was the name of it, Sugar Hill.
Speaker 2: What was that club like?  Just set up the atmosphere for me.
Speaker 1: It was a blues, blue lights, you know, cool (laughter).  And we'd see people like Ruth Brown and Della Reese [HistoryMaker Della Reese-Lett].  The Drifters would play there.
Speaker 2: So, it was a live band atmosphere?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.  And jazz people would play there, a lot of jazz people--Carmen McRae.  And so many, I can't even think, you know.
Speaker 2: So, you hung out at Sugar Hill?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And where was that located?
Speaker 1: 135th [Street] and Lenox [Avenue; Malcolm X Boulevard], yeah, in the city.
Speaker 2: What other places did you hang out?
Speaker 1: We hung out at the Apollo [Theater, New York, New York] and the Palm Cafe [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: What's the Palm Cafe?
Speaker 1: The Palm Cafe was just down the way from the Apollo, just down the street.
Speaker 2: And that was on what street?
Speaker 1: On 125th Street and 8th Avenue [Frederick Douglass Boulevard].
Speaker 2: Oh, I know, but for the oral history (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I know, I know what you mean, yeah.
Speaker 2: So, that was on 125th Street?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: What was 125th Street like at that time?
Speaker 1: Oh, it was kicking, it was really cool.  I'm telling you, we had parties there.  We partied at the bar. They had the Silver Rail [Bar, New York, New York], which all the singers and entertainers would come to after their show at the Apollo.  Because at that time, they would sell--serving five for a dollar (laughter).  And it was so--the booze was so watered down it didn't make no difference, you know (laughter).  So that's basically where we hung out.  And we played the jukebox, you know, and just jammed there.
Story_ID: 283512
Speaker 1: Who did you listen to when you were not singing background music?  Who did you enjoy listening to?
Speaker 2: I enjoyed listening to Carmen McRae and Della Reese [HistoryMaker Della Reese-Lett].
Speaker 1: What type of music does Carmen McRae and Della Reese, what type of music were they singing?
Speaker 2: Della was a, well, ballad--a balladeer.  She did things like the standards, 'Time After Time' and many others.  She was a big star.  And Carmen McRae was a big jazz artist.  She played piano and sang.  I loved Billy Eckstine.  I mean, since I was ten I loved Billy Eckstine.
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet him?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me about Billy Eckstine.
Speaker 2: I met him, finally met him in Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada].  And I was working there as well.  So, you know, I was old enough to be cruising with Billy Eckstine (laughter).  And I followed him around all night long.  And his wife, her name is June [Eckstine].  She said, "You better quit following my husband.  I want you to stop it."  She said, "You don't need that" (laughter).
Story_ID: 283721
Speaker 1: We're rolling, we're on tape three.  You're in Las Vegas [Nevada], and you're doing your own--what were you doing in Las Vegas?
Speaker 2: I was performing at Caesars Palace [Las Vegas, Nevada] on the Barge, Cleopatra's Barge.  And I was good.  They booked me for six weeks, and I stayed there for a year and a half.  That's how good I was (laughter).  And the town was full, I'm telling you.  And Caesars, in the main room they had Sammy Davis, Jr.  Another time they had Vic Damone.  And I was packing the Barge.  And they had Shirley [ph.].  And they said, "Well, who is in there now? Wait a minute (laughter)," because they were losing people.  Anyway, I stayed there a year and half; that was a long time.  That's what I was doing, working.
Story_ID: 283722
Speaker 1: I want to go back a little in time before Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada].  We were talking off-camera about 'You're No Good,' and 'I'm Gonna Make You Love Me.'
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And 'I'm Going to Make You Love Me' was later covered by Motown [Records, Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Yes, they had The Supremes and The Temptations.  Like I said, they covered me, but they had to use two groups, men and women, to cover my record (laughter).  So, that's my only refuge, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: And with 'You're No Good'?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Betty Everett covered that.  And I think you mentioned that she might have had that song before I did.  I never heard that, perhaps she did.  And maybe I covered her.  So what are you going to do? (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And then later on, that song was covered by Linda.
Speaker 2: Linda Ronstadt, yeah.
Speaker 1: Linda Ronstadt.
Speaker 2: She had a really, really big hit on it.  But she complimented me in the Billboard.  She said, "That's the copy that I copied mine from, [HistoryMaker] Dee Dee Warwick's."  So, that works.
Speaker 1: So, I want to also just mention a few people that you had the opportunity to work with in R&B and soul.  Eddie Townsend?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ed Townsend was my producer.  He produced my, he produced 'I Want to Be With You' and 'We're Doing Fine.'  He produced, what else did he produce?  He produced just about all of my big records.  I think Horace Ott did 'We're Doing Fine' with Ed Townsend. And Ed was a dear friend, not just a producer, but a dear, dear friend.  And he just recently passed away, as I mentioned.  But he did just about every big hit record I ever had.  I wish he hadn't gone away [laughter].
Speaker 1: Eddie Kendricks?
Speaker 2: Eddie was fine.  I didn't know him that well.  You know, I knew him from being with The Temptations, of course.  And Eddie ran into trouble.  So, he died.
Speaker 1: What trouble did he run into?
Speaker 2: Well, he became busy in things he shouldn't have been doing, you know.  Far be it from me to speak on what his life was, because that's what he chose; that's what he chose.
Story_ID: 283723
Speaker 1: Speaking about that in general, was that--how did artists like yourself--who helped you stay away from that path?  Who kept you off that path?
Speaker 2: My mother [Arthur Lee Drinkard Warrick], child, my mother (laughter).  My mother would have killed us if we got into anything like that.  And the people around us like Sam Cooke, Esther Phillips--they would bash anybody that came to Dionne [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick] and I about anything off-color, I mean, and run them away.
Story_ID: 283724
Speaker 1: So you were just saying your mother [Arthur Lee Drinkard Warrick] was very strict on you, she kept you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and Dionne [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick]--
Speaker 2: Even, even--like I was saying, when we left the gospel field, she would not let us, she wouldn't have us leaving our upbringing and our roots and our character.  It just wasn't in us to do it, you know.  We did our little doo da das, but we knew where to stop it.
Speaker 1: Where the line stops.
Speaker 2: Yeah, when the slip starts hanging, you stop (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, was that an old saying?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: The saying, when the slip starts hanging, you stop?
Speaker 2: Yeah, somebody would walk up to you and say, "Your slip is hanging" (laughter).  That means you're showing.  That's a good pun for you, you know, get your act together.
Story_ID: 283725
Speaker 1: So you were also--what year was it you were inducted into the [R&B] Hall of Fame?
Speaker 2: That was not long ago.  Well, what year was it?  It was '99 [1999], yes, '99 [1999].
Speaker 1: And how did that come about?
Speaker 2: They voted for me.  You know, I'd been up for the award many times, but didn't get enough votes.  But for goodness sake, I did get it this time.  And it was for 'I'm Going to Make You Love Me.' Now isn't that ironic?  And [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy and The Supremes were at the dinner.
Speaker 1: What was it like?  Tell me about the atmosphere.  I mean it's got to be exciting.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes.  It was a gala evening, you know, a big, formal dinner and a show.  As a matter of fact, I performed 'I'm Going to Make You Love Me.' And Dionne [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick] announced me as a winner, introduced me.  So, it was quite a special night.
Speaker 1: She must be very, she must have been very proud.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, she was, yeah.  It's like when I was up for the Grammy [Award].  Now I've been nominated for three Grammys.
Speaker 1: Now what years were that, that you nominated for the Grammys?
Speaker 2: That must have been '68 [1968], '69 [1969], something like that.  I got nominated for 'Foolish Fool' and I got nominated again in--no, my first Grammy nomination wasn't in the '60s [1960s], it was in the '70s [1970s].  And then I got another nomination for 'She Kept on Talking, But She Didn't Know' [sic. 'She Didn't Know (She Kept on Talking)'].  And that was with Atlantic ATCO Records.  And as a matter of fact, that album I did, the cover established a whole new category in the Grammys, for the cover.  It was such a great cover.  It was called 'Turning Around' with a nice picture of me.  The guy who lived across the street from me was with Blood, Sweat and Tears (laughter) in Hollywood there, and he took the picture because he was an aspiring photographer.  And it came out so good, they put it on the cover.  So I mean, it's been pretty good.
Speaker 1: As you look back--I mean we just hit here and there over your life.  What are the things that stand out for you in the career you've had as a singer?
Speaker 2: Well, that night at the Pioneer's [Pioneer Awards], of course, and at the Grammys [Grammy Awards].  Because I used to go basically all of them.  And when I was nominated the year for 'Foolish Fool,' myself, Aretha Franklin, Esther Phillips, and two other people I forgot--but Dionne was announcing again the winner.  And she was, everybody was so sure I was going to get it.  And Dionne was announcing, and she says, "And the winner is--" and she knew it was me.  She said, "Aretha Franklin?"  (Laughter) It was a funny thing.  I was the same way.  I was like (laughter).  But the UP, the IP, AP [Associated Press], said, "Now, you come right back to us."  Because it was going to be a big deal, you know, that Dionne and I both had that kind of success.  But it wasn't to be.  But it will come, it will come.
Story_ID: 283726
Speaker 1: So as you're moving forward, we were talking some of the things you're working on.  And you are now doing a play?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My manager is putting a play up called 'Your Arms Are Too Short to Box with God' ['Your Arms Too Short to Box with God: A Soaring Celebration in Song and Dance,' Vinnette Carroll].  It's going to be a wonderful play.  It's a gospel play, and all of the music was written by Professor Alex Bradford, who I told you was a dear, dear friend of mine who has since passed.  But this play is going to back to Broadway after going two times, and it's going to go back the third time.  And it's the only play in history that's done that on Broadway.  No play has gone back three times and was successful.  But that play has been successful two times, and it will be again.  Looking forward to it.
Story_ID: 283727
Speaker 1: So, when you think of--also, there are a lot of successful musicians in your family.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Well, Cissy, Cissy Houston, Whitney [Houston].
Speaker 1: Well, starting like with your mother [Arthur Lee Drinkard Warrick].
Speaker 2: Yeah, of course.
Speaker 1: But Cissy Houston sang also with your mother?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: They were in the--
Speaker 2: The Drinkards [Drinkard Singers].
Speaker 1: Drinkards.
Speaker 2: Drinkards, yes.
Speaker 1: And then she spun off and continued to do gospel, with her own--
Speaker 2: Yes, with her ensemble she established; she established an ensemble.  And she directed our choirs at our church, you know.  She had the young people's choir and she had the C.H. Walters Choir which Dionne [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick] and I were members of.
Speaker 1: What was the name of that choir?
Speaker 2: C.H. Walters, he was our minister.
Speaker 1: Now why was it C.H. Walters?
Speaker 2: He was our minister.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she named the choir after him.  And it was one of the popular churches in Newark [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: What was the name of that church?
Speaker 2: New Hope Baptist Church [Newark, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: And that was a big church for you guys?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  And it's even bigger now.  I mean, it's enormous now.
Speaker 1: And New Hope Baptist Church is where Whitney started to sing--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and where she got her start.
Speaker 2: Exactly, yeah, with her mother [Cissy Houston] there, sure.
Speaker 1: So, the church has been a stomping ground--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --for breeding great musicians in the family.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, sure.
Speaker 1: What do you think it is about gospel that touches the family so much?
Speaker 2: I think it's because it's the truth, you know.  I can compare rhythm and blues with gospel, because rhythm and blues tells the truth.  You know, if you're sad it gives you an avenue to speak on it in a song, almost to the matter of a meter, like I told you.  Gospel is the same way.  You can just explode, you know, and let it all hang out (laughter).
Story_ID: 283728
Speaker 1: So, throughout the time we've talked, we've not talked much about race.  I mean, you are pretty an artist across all racial lines.  But were there ever any times when you have experienced being a black artist?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes.  One place in particular, we were in Seattle, Washington.  And we did the show, and this is during the time when my sister [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick] was pregnant, and I was working with her.  I was opening her shows.  And the man told us after we did the show to get the hell out of his hotel and don't come back.  And we had killed them.  We had a good crowd, and everybody loved us.  And he--the police escorted us across Seattle lines, yes, they did.  Two cars behind us, and we were all in the car.  And my sister's piano player, Jon Mayer, who's on TV now, he was going to just lay there and look at the football game.  And we left him, because they were going to hurt us.  You know, they were pushing Dionne, and it was a very, very bad thing.  And Jon came running trying to catch the car, and we stopped and let him in, because they were going to get him, too.  And the irony of the thing is that Dionne's musicians are all white, except one.  It was weird.
Speaker 1: Why did it happen?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  When we tried to pay the hotel bill, they wouldn't accept American Express.  They wouldn't take it from us; we had to pay them in cash.  And then we got escorted out of town.
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: This was like in '79 [1979], '78 [1978], yeah.  You'd be surprised.  You know, I have experienced more racism now than I ever have in my life.  When I went to high school there was only maybe forty or fifty blacks, that's it.  And the rest of the population was white.  And it was a fine high school [East Orange High School; East Orange Campus High School, East Orange, New Jersey].  And we lived right where we could--we had to go.  It was a public school; they had to let us come.  When we were going to take swimming classes, they closed the pool and made it a basketball court.  You know, they did that, I'm telling you.  So, we all have experienced it, of course, being of color.  It's just a vicious circle.
Story_ID: 283729
Speaker 1: Let's speak to what you think about music today.
Speaker 2: I don't hear very much music today.  The rap is a loop to me.  And I never understood rap very well, because I don't know why they're screaming and hollering at me and calling me names.  They don't know me.  I've met them, you know, and I never could--I can't get that, I don't get it.  And to speak of their mothers and their families like they do, you know, and how they speak of women.  It's a sad situation.  And you see it's the devil in it, because they're all fighting each other now, killing each other.  It's incredible, but that's the way it is.  So, I don't hear too much music today.  I like [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson, she's still recording.  And the other part is there are not that many record companies today, other than the rap companies that are owned by the rap artists.  There used to be RCA [Records, New York, New York]; RCA is still there.  There used to be Mercury [Records]; there used to be Atlantic [Records, New York, New York], and Atlantic is somewhat there.  But they've got all those rappers too, the rappers.  And I guess they're making big, big money.  But some dollars I don't need (laughter).  So that's why I don't hear, I don't hear much of anything.
Speaker 1: Who do you like?  Who do you think is making good music today?
Speaker 2: Nancy Wilson, Dionne [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick], Whitney [Houston].  It's hard to think of somebody (laughter).  It really is, and I'm not being smart; I'm just saying how--I like, what's her name?  What's that girl's name?  Anita, Anita Adams.
Speaker 1: Oleta.
Speaker 2: Oleta Adams, yeah.  I like also that other girl, the one who sings and you can't understand anything she's saying.  The one--very smooth.
Speaker 1: Mariah Carey?
Speaker 2: No, Mariah's all right.  What's that girl's name?  You know who I'm talking about.  Anita--
Speaker 1: "Some people want it all," and the piano, she plays piano also?
Speaker 2: No, that's Oleta.  I'm talking about Anita Baker.
Speaker 1: Anita Baker.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I like her a lot, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's a lot of people I guess somewhere singing something, but I don't hear it.  I listen mostly these days to talk radio, because I want to see what they're doing, you know, what's next.  I listen to that guy, what's his name?  Rush Limbaugh.  Because I want to see what his madness is this week, do you understand me? Then I may know how to deal with some things that come up out of me, because they inevitably will.
Speaker 1: So, let's put it in context.  Who is Rush Limbaugh?
Speaker 2: Rush Limbaugh is a radio personality who is a very popular one, you know.  And he speaks to, he leans far to the right, you know, the Republicans--Bush, Bush, Bush.  He's wrong, and I believe he's wrong because I think Mr. Bush [President George Walker Bush] is wrong with the decisions that he makes.  But Rush backs him up.  And you got a lot of people calling in agreeing with him.
Story_ID: 283730
Speaker 1: It's happened recently.  And we're talking about modern--what do you think about what has happened in New Orleans with the Katrina [Hurricane Katrina], the hurricane, the storm, and the thousands of black people that have been misplaced?
Speaker 2: I am devastated.  I am amazed that America let that kind of thing happen, let this man [President George Walker Bush] just get away with not just doing nothing for a week.  That is an outrage.  I am furious.  And if he had to run again for president, I think I might move to Brazil like my sister [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick] did.  I am too serious.  This is a bad, bad thing, to let those people suffer like that.
Speaker 1: Did your sister move to Brazil?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she has a house in Brazil.  She's planning on moving there permanently.  I don't think I'm going to do that (laughter).
Story_ID: 283731
Speaker 1: So, when you see yourself--you're doing the play ['Your Arms Too Short to Box with God: A Soaring Celebration in Song and Dance,' Vinnette Carroll].  Do you have other, what are the other things you still have left to do, that you haven't done?  You've done so much (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I'd like to go back to recording, you know, making good records with good music.  And hopefully, that'll happen.  I can't say, because you never know, you know, what's going to fall.  The writers that used to be there aren't there, you know.  Like, the material that I used to do was excellent material.  The material that Dionne [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick] did was great material.  There will never be another Burt Bacharach or Hal David.  Like, there'll never be--like Celine Dion, she's nice.  But there'll never be another Barbra Streisand.  There'll never be another Judy Garland.  That's the way I feel.  And to me, they established what we were trying to get to--the good music, the good plays, the good content, you know.  Today it's the Rocky Horror [Picture] Show (laughter).  You know, most of it is.  So, we'll see what comes.
Speaker 1: So do you--as we sit here today, is there anything that you can think of that we haven't talked about that should be included in your oral history?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.  Well, what we've covered is a lot.  I can't speak about what's to come, because I'm waiting, you know, for that to come.  And it certainly will; I just have to be a little more patient and wait a little longer.  If you got to wait, you got to wait.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's called life.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: As long as we're here, we're waiting.  You know, we're doing it, and waiting (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's true, and I hope to succeed in waiting here (laughter).
Story_ID: 283732
Speaker 1: It must be exciting, though, for you to have witnessed your cousin [Whitney Houston] become a super, super star?
Speaker 2: Oh, really, it was phenomenal.
Speaker 1: And, and it, I mean it's just mind-boggling.
Speaker 2: It really is, it really is.  And a movie star, and the whole--
Speaker 1: Yes, the whole--
Speaker 2: The whole thing.
Speaker 1: The whole kit and caboodle.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: She is a huge star.
Speaker 2: It's like the Midas touch.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I'm saying Jesus!
Speaker 1: And did you see that in her--was she that type of a child?
Speaker 2: She was tenacious, yeah, she did what she wanted to do.  She was respectful, you know.  She--
Speaker 1: But it was that same mom [Cissy Houston], saying, "Sing out," just as she told you, "Sing out."
Speaker 2: Absolutely, the same thing.  Cissy taught me, taught her.
Speaker 1: Well, how was she a good teacher, Cissy?
Speaker 2: No-nonsense, no-nonsense.  If you're going to do it, do it.  If you're not--But that's the way my family is.  It's like if you're going to do it, go ahead and do it.  But do it right, do it well.
Speaker 1: What does your sister teach you, or what has she taught you?
Speaker 2: Dionne [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick] has taught me to finish what I start.  That's mainly what I've learned from Dionne.  Dionne is not a slacker, she doesn't fall short.  And unless she makes a mistake--and everybody makes those--fortunately she's been able to recoup what she's made a mistake about, what she had lost.  And I've learned that I have to do the same thing, and I do.  You know, it's not easy.  It's a bitter pill sometimes, but you do it.
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Arthur Lee Drinkard Warrick] teach you about life?
Speaker 2: My mother taught me about love.  Love each other and take care of each other.  It's like the Book says, "Do unto others before they do it to you."  (Laughter) No, "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."  That doesn't happen very often.  As a matter of fact, it's rare.  But it's still a good thing to look towards, you know, and try to do; to me it is.  You know, I still try to do that.
Speaker 1: Your father [Mancel Warrick], what did you learn from him?
Speaker 2: Perseverance.  Just keep on stepping.  You know, and believe in yourself.  He gave me a lot of belief in myself.
Story_ID: 283733
Speaker 1: So, do you have hopes for the black community?  What are your hopes for the black community?
Speaker 2: God, yes, I do.  I hope the black community would learn to, like I just said, love each other.  You know, don't go overboard and knock yourself out, but do the right thing, as we say.  Do the right thing, and the right thing will come back to you, hopefully.  It don't happen like that all the time, but it happens sometimes, at least sometime, you know.
Story_ID: 283734
Speaker 1: When you're not walking on this planet anymore, what do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: Walking on this planet (laughter).  Really, I was here to represent, and I did (laughter).
Story_ID: 283735
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I don't have a clue, I don't.  Hopefully I inspired some people to sing well, and to keep their health, you know, and try to keep their eye on the ball.
Speaker 1: And lastly, as we sit here today, what message would you have for people that will see your oral history, and what you've experienced--young children or, you know, people that will be educated by this oral history?  Your message to them is?
Speaker 2: Well, I hope I've informed you about myself, and that you learned something from what I've experienced.  I consider myself a very fortunate person.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Because I've had the opportunity to do what I'm doing.  Everybody doesn't have the opportunity to do what they love.  And here I do, and I'm thankful for it, truly thankful.
Story_ID: 283736
Speaker 1: Hi, I'm [HistoryMaker] Dee Dee Warwick.  That's me sitting right there.  That picture you see represented my promotional package.  And I guess it must have been late '60s [1960s]. And taken by (unclear) who did all of the stars' photographs. He's an excellent photographer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is me, Dee Dee.  This is at my mother's [Arthur Lee Drinkard Warrick] tribute dinner.  And it was in '82 [1982], something like that, during the time she had just turned like sixty, a beautiful lady.  So, I sang for her that day.
Speaker 2: What did you sing?
Speaker 1: I sang, 'It's in my Heart.' It's a gospel song, a beautiful song.  Dionne [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick] and I were supposed to have appeared there together, but she couldn't get a flight.  She was stuck in Minneapolis [Minnesota] or somewhere in a snowstorm.  So, I did it just myself.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Hi, this is me again, in action at my mother's tribute dinner.  Like I said, I think it was about '81 [1981], '82 [1982], somewhere in that area.
