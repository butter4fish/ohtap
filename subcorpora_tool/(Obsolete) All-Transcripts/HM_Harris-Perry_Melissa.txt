Speaker 1: So we are going to begin by slating.  I am Harriette Cole.  I am the interviewer.  Isaac Feldman is the videographer.  Julieanna Richardson, Danielle Lynn, and Matthew Hickey are observers.  I would like for you to say and spell your name, tell me today's date and where we are please.
Speaker 2: Melissa Harris-Perry, M-E-L-I-S-S-A, H-A-R-R-I-S hyphen P-E-R-R-Y, and today is, September 13, 12, (laughter) today is September 12th and we are in New York City [New York] in 30 Rock [30 Rockefeller Center].
Speaker 1: 2014.
Speaker 2: 2014, yes.  All of that is true (laughter).
Speaker 1: Great.  And please tell me when and where you were born.
Speaker 2: I was born in Seattle, Washington, October 2, 1973.
Speaker 1: Excellent.
Story_ID: 564881
Speaker 1: So I would like to start with some People magazine-type questions.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Hmmm.  I like lots of kinds of food, but I really do love sweets and so probably my favorite food is my own homemade red velvet cake.
Speaker 1: And your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Oh, fall.  Yes, I think because I'm an October baby.  My husband [James Perry] is also born in October, and our anniversary is in October, and so for me, the fall and the changing leaves, so also I think being an educator, fall feels like the beginning of the year instead of January and so I really love the fall.
Speaker 1: Your favorite color.
Speaker 2: These days, my favorite color is Tiffany blue.
Speaker 1: Your favorite travel destination.
Speaker 2: Barcelona, Spain is my favorite travel destination, even though we have done Paris [France] more often and I adore Paris, the only place that ever made me think, oh, I would just come and live here, was Barcelona.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite saying or phrase?
Speaker 2: Um, I am not really sure that this is my favorite phrase, but I most frequently say, "the struggle continues" and that comes from my father [William M. Harris, Sr.], who used to sign our birthday cards even when I was five years old (laughter).  He would sign it, not "love Daddy," but "the struggle continues, Daddy."  And so, when I sign my own books, I always sign it "the struggle continues."
Story_ID: 564882
Speaker 1: So I would like to begin with your family history.  Would you please tell me your mother's name and where and when she was born and tell me about her, please.
Speaker 2: So my mother is Diana Gray, and she was born in San Francisco, California in 1943.  She didn't grow up in California.  She grew up in Spokane, Washington, and the sort of important things to know about my mother's people are that my mother's people are Mormon and, in fact, her, I guess her great, her grandparents, came as English immigrants, following the Mormon prophet, who'd come to them and who had spoken to them about being Latter-day Saints.  They actually became part of that movement of Latter-day Saints who pushed hand carts across the American West when they were ejected, because of the, the stereotyping and the repression against Mormons and against their freedom of religion at that period.  They pushed hand carts across the American West, you know Latter-day Saints, one of the things we do is we keep really good records so we know the whole story of that movement, and then my mother's mother, Anne [ph.], was born in California as part of that movement.  Her first few children were born in California, but she raised them in Spokane, Washington.  So, my mother is the fourth of five children in what was a family that was very observant to Latter-day Saints, although maybe not so much my grandfather.  He was mostly just religious about his golf.  She went off to Brigham Young University [Provo, Utah].  In 1964, she graduated, having written newspaper articles about Mormon womanhood, ran off to Las Vegas [Nevada] with her boyfriend at the time, (whispers) had sex--one night and so woke up and got married the next morning in Las Vegas in an orange mohair dress at the Hitching Post Chapel (laughter) and that was my sister's father, so she married him, she lived, had my sister [Elizabeth], lived for a few years, and then suffered through first the divorce with him, and then eventually from his suicide after they divorced, found herself a single parent with really no place in the church that had such traditional roles for women and so she went through the highly radicalizing experience of going to graduate school, went to the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] in sociology, studied criminology, but especially women in the criminal justice system, wrote a master's thesis about women's sex workers and the experience that these women were having and the ways in which they were being exploited and also girls and women in the criminal justice system and the ways in which they were being often incarcerated for what were called "status offenses."  So, a girl would be raped by her stepfather and she would run away because she had been sexually assaulted and then she would be put into juvenile detention because of a status offense of being a runaway.  In the process of that experience, my mother was a graduate student who was teaching a statistics course, and that is where she met my very loud-mouthed father [William M. Harris, Sr.] , so it's kind of a quirky story, because if you met my mom today, social justice advocate, you know, white woman who raised an African American child who, you know, has lived in my household since my now almost thirteen-year-old was born and helped raise, you know, African American grandchildren, who has lived in New Orleans [Louisiana], in Chicago [Illinois] and New Jersey, who is quite cosmopolitan in her role view and progressive, it would be hard to imagine that she is the 1964 Mormon womanhood, you know, Brigham Young University graduate, but she is all of those things.  And so, my mom was both the most traditional, sweet honest little-old white lady you'll ever meet and also this kind of, you know, woman who was part of an underground network to make sure women could access abortions before Roe v. Wade.  She is an extraordinary woman and has really impacted who I am.
Story_ID: 564883
Speaker 1: When you look at your mom's [Diana Gray] family history, in her family were there polygamists?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh yes.  In fact, my mom has all kinds of emotions about Latter-day Saints who fled into Mexico rather than to do what our ancestors did.  So, my ancestors were married, were in a plural marriage, and when Utah became a state and plural marriage became illegal, my ancestor chose to go to jail rather than to divorce his wives because he had both a moral and a personal commitment to his plural marriage.  He both understood it as a calling from God to engage in plural marriage and, again, think about the time for a man to divorce a woman not only left her in their understanding morally susceptible to an afterlife that could not be the afterlife that she wanted because she had engaged in plural marriage, but also economically, socially, what did it do to her children, so my uncle took a stand, did not flee, and, in fact, went to federal prison for a few years as a result.
Speaker 1: Now, at what time was this?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm going to get these years wrong but I know it is at the period when the Utah Territory is becoming a state, so I guess we're talking about the late 1800s, 1880s [Utah became a state in 1896], I think, but I could be getting the years wrong.
Speaker 1: And then subsequently, it's illegal.  Did your family continue to have plural marriage?
Speaker 2: No, not officially.  You know, I think there are complicated ways in which my own family, my own immediate family might be understood as a plural marriage, which, if you'd like, we can talk about, but no one was legally married at that point and interestingly enough, none of the five siblings in my mother's family have remained in the Latter-day Saints Church.  All of them went on and did a variety of different things. Some of them remained religious, others did not, but none of them remained in the Church.
Speaker 1: Including your mother?
Speaker 2: Including my mother, yes, right.  No, mom loved the church, literally cast herself into outer darkness after the divorce and the suicide [of her first husband] and the decision to go to graduate school.
Speaker 1: And, he committed suicide as a result of the end of the marriage?
Speaker 2: No, he was probably ill for a long time, but my mom particularly understands it as responsive to his experiences in the context of Vietnam [Vietnam War], so this was my sister so I am the youngest of five.  There are three siblings who are my father's and his first wives'-- wife's children, and then there is my sister who is my mother's child from her first marriage, and then there, I am the only one who is of both of my parents.  We didn't experience, or at least I didn't experience anybody as half brothers and sisters.  We were all, they are just my brothers and sisters, but this, so I never met the father of my sister, Elizabeth.  He had taken his own life long before I was born.
Speaker 1: And are you the only African American?
Speaker 2: No, so my father has, was married initially to an African American woman and has three children who have both of their parents African American.  My sister, both of her parents are white, and then I am the only one who has one white parent and one black parent.
Speaker 1: Got it.
Story_ID: 564884
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about your father [William M. Harris, Sr.]?  His name, where, and when he was born and about his family?
Speaker 2: Sure.  So, on the one hand you have got European immigrants who show up to follow a Mormon missionary and push hand carts across the West, know about oppression and ejection that way, and sort of stand by their moral beliefs around those questions from my mom's [Diana Gray] side.  My father, William McKinley Harris [Sr.], was born in Church Hill in Richmond, Virginia in 1941, yes, October 1941.  The story could not be more different than my mother's story.  We are descended on my father's side from enslaved peoples.  We know this in part because we have traced back from my Grandma Rosa [Harris], so this is my father's mother.  We have traced back on her side all the way to a woman sold on the street corner right there in Church Hill; so, in fact my dad's family did not go far.  Born in 1941, my dad was raised initially in the Jim Crow South as an African American man.  He and his twin brother are the fourth and fifth child of a family of five, just like my mom and just like me, actually.  The twins, daddy and his twin brother, Wesley [HM Wesley Harris], were always considered kind of special.  They are, if you meet them, even now, just the smartest people.  When you are in the room, you can feel their intelligence, their carriage of self.  Apparently, their father who was a business owner in Richmond was very similar.  My grandfather [William M. Harris, Sr.] passed before I, when my father was only twelve, so I never met him but there are many stories about Mack.  Mack is my granddad, and the ways in which he also had that big presence and for a black man living in the Jim Crow South at that time, to have a big presence was, in fact, quite dangerous.  But, he owned his businesses.  He died when my dad and uncle were very young, of a heart attack.  My dad then goes on, graduates from Armstrong [High School] at a time of segregation, plays both baseball and football for the Armstrong team, goes off to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], where he also plays on the football team.  His twin brother goes to the University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia] and, as I just learned last summer, at one point my uncle, his twin, hosts [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King, Jr. for a speech at the University of Virginia in what turns out to be the summer before the March on Washington, and he is, he actually plays host to Dr. King and so, when the March on Washington occurs [1963], my, my uncle comes up from the University of Virginia and meets my dad at Howard on the bus.  They go over.  They are together there at the Washington Mall, so my mom is off in Utah at Brigham Young University [Provo, Utah] writing about Mormon womanhood, and my dad and uncle are at the March on Washington.  Daddy studied physics as an undergraduate and then went to get his Ph.D. in urban planning at the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] in the late '60s [1960s], early 1970s, which is where he met my mom.  He was married to his high school sweetheart, Kathy Branch [ph.], yeah, Branch is her last name, and they have three children, one right after the other while my dad is still in college, so by the time my dad graduates from Howard, he has three children, each one year apart from each other.  My sisters were Lisa and Dana [ph.], and my brother, William, Jr, or Billy as he was called as a kid and Will now, and they are now 12, 11, and 10 years older than me so they were really quite a bit older than I was growing up, but that whole family then moves out to the West, out to Washington where my siblings, you know, first go to school as kids there, while my dad is working on his Ph.D., becomes a college professor, meets my mom, they have me, and in 1976, we all return to Virginia.  My dad returns as the first Dean of African American Affairs at the University of Virginia, bringing with him back from Washington state, his wife who also grew up in Richmond, and their three children, and my mother and me and my sister, Beth [Elizabeth], and we all come back together to immediate post Jim Crow (laughter) 1976 Virginia, and that is where I was raised.
Story_ID: 564885
Speaker 1: So, you all come back--he [William M. Harris, Sr.] is still married to his first wife.
Speaker 2: To Kathy [Branch (ph.)], that's right.  She is my godmother.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: I know, it's hard.
Speaker 1: Can you describe that relationship?
Speaker 2: I mean, I think probably the best description of it, although this is not a legal designation of it, is that it was a plural marriage, which is to say that my godmother, Kathy, who is also the mother of my three eldest siblings, was completely aware of the relationship.  We did not all live together in the same house.  My mother [Diana Gray] operated very much as a single parent in that she lived alone in our own house with my older sister [Elizabeth] and I, and Daddy was a regular visitor in our home.  I was a regular visitor in his home.  I saw all of my siblings as simply my siblings.  I think that the arrangement, I don't know enough about the adults.  You know, despite now being an adult myself and despite having talked to all of my relatives about this a lot, I don't really know what motivated my mom or my godmom or my dad.  I don't, honestly I don't know.  It was the '70s [1970s].  Maybe they were just into something.  But I do know that the people on who it was hardest were clearly my oldest siblings.  Those four siblings who had lived in a different kind of existence and then into an existence which, for most of their lives, had to be silent.  Just, we were told not to talk about it.  Obviously, my dad was working on tenure [at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia] and it was the 1970s in Virginia and there were cross-racial issues and there were status issues and all of that, but when you're born into something as I was, it's always normal, and so I just, it made perfect sense to me that my dad and my godmom and my siblings would live in one house and my mom and my sister and I would live in another (laughter)! Honestly it was not until my twenties that I had any sort of questioning of it and I don't think I've ever even had any angst about it, but I know it was harder on my older siblings and it is also probably something that no one ever wanted to talk about and in certain ways it just gets forced because now that I'm a public person and now that I talk about my dad and I talk about my mom, anyone who knew us at that time, when I say things like "oh, my mom is..." or I'll say "my Daddy.." and people who knew my Daddy at that time will say, "wait a minute, you're not Kathy's kid" or if I talk about my mom, they'll say, "but wait a minute, the years don't...that doesn't work out."  And so, I used to say I'll write this book some day when everyone has passed on, because I don't want to hurt anyone, but once I became a public person in our intimate circle, it just became public, so I figure we should talk about it, you know.
Story_ID: 564886
Speaker 1: What is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Oh, very easy.  Riding on the back of my mom's [Diana Gray] bike in that little child seat that we would put back there and it was yellow, and I can remember very distinctly riding behind her.  I could see her hair and her back, and it was in Charlottesville [Virginia], and their honeysuckle when they bloom are very, very powerful smell, so it's really just kind of the memory of my mom's back and jostling up and down in this baby seat on the back of a bike and smelling the honeysuckle.
Speaker 1: How old were you then?
Speaker 2: Oh, I had to have been under two, because I think by the time I'm three, well actually that can't be true, let's see.  If I'm in Virginia then I'm between two and three, but under four, yeah.
Story_ID: 564887
Speaker 1: I would like for you to describe the house, the neighborhood where you grew up, what sights, sounds, and smells do you recall?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's easy.  So that's 413B Harris Road, in Charlottesville, Virginia.  I could even tell you, 977-7167, because you have to, you know, you have to remember your phone number as a kid, so I always thought it was cool that I was growing up on Harris Road and I was a Harris.  It always helped me to remember and to feel kind of special, as if the street was named after me.  It was not, but it made me feel that way.  It was a little neighborhood of townhouses, so we didn't live in a single family unattached home, my mom [Diana Gray] and sister [Elizabeth] and I, until I was in middle school.  My dad [William M. Harris, Sr.] did.  He and his wife [Kathy Branch (ph.)] and kids had a, still owned this historic home in the University District, but we lived in a little town home attached and it was a JAG school neighborhood, so, the Judge Advocate General, so what that meant was these families would move in.  The JAG students would be there for a year, maybe for two years, and then they would move out, and they were there really just during the school year because the Army was moving them around.  So, it was a neighborhood where I made new friends every single year because people didn't live, I think we were one of the few families that really lived there long term.  The Welk Place neighborhood in which I lived, was a kind of transient but always lots of kids so JAG school folks were people in their twenties and they have always got young kids and so they come and I would meet them and the neighborhood basically had two cul-de-sacs.  You go down one street and there was a cul-de-sac, and then up around another and then there was another cul-de-sac, and then back out to Harris Road, which was a busy road and my entire life was riding my bike through those cul-de-sacs, or every once in a while my mom wouldn't and let me have a big wheel, but a lot of boys in the neighborhood have big wheels or a green machine and I would get to ride theirs through those cul-de-sacs.  Then, the very best part of Harris Road was that across the street from Harris Road was Jackson Via Elementary School.  Jackson Via was named for two African American women, public elementary school that I attended from kindergarten through fifth grade and was across the street.  I never rode a bus.  I just walked across the street to my elementary school so every year there is a picture of me getting bigger and bigger across the, as compared to the Jackson Via sign.  What that meant was that even though we didn't have a big yard, I had the whole school yard over there that I could play in including all summer.  It was the, you know, Charlottesville is in the mountains, right in the shadow of Monticello.  My dad teaches at UVA [University of Virginia].  I grew up with a real obsession about Thomas Jefferson, but most of what I remember is it was idyllic, it was safe.  I don't really know where my parents were, like I don't really, I honestly cannot remember where my parents were Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, because we were just out.  Kids were just, and I also had these older siblings so we rode the city bus and we took the, you know, we'd go down and eat ice cream on the downtown mall, or we would take dance classes at McGuffey Art Center, and the idea that we would be tethered to anything other than the street lights coming on, I mean, we were just outside and we didn't have cell phones and there was no alarm system on the house (laughter) and so no one knew when we came home or when we left, but it was, I just remember feeling very free and very, like my childhood felt very easy to me.
Story_ID: 564888
Speaker 1: What kinds of family rituals did you have in your home?
Speaker 2: Christmas.  My mother [Diana Gray] has a Christmas obsession which she passed along to me and I now very high level Christmas obsession, so despite the fact that my dad was a college professor, we did not have a lot of money; again, because my mom mostly operated as a single parent and, again in the '70s [1970s] in a time when women were still really brutalized by the wage gap.  I mean, the wage gap continues to exist but it was just ugly, and she was often un- or under-employed during those years, but somehow, every year Christmas was just an extravaganza and it must be, in part, that she just saved all year or bought small things, but there were always tons of decorations so, you know, you get the boxes out basically the day after Thanksgiving.  The day after Thanksgiving you get out the boxes and New Year's Day you take them all down.  It was very like, it's up from the day after Thanksgiving to the day after New Year's Day and that's it, hanging lights.  There would be a tree that would go up, always a real tree, never a fake tree, like she has all kinds of feelings about this.  You hang the stockings, and then there were cookies.  We would bake cookies like someone was coming.  (whispers)--no one came over--but we would bake just platters of all these different kinds of cookies and especially these sugar cookies that we would decorate for hours, like it was Christmas.  It was all about Christmas.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 564889
Speaker 1: Now you said your mom [Diana Gray] grew up as a Mormon.  What was the religion in your household when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  Well, probably two religions, Black Nationalism brought by my father [William M. Harris, Sr.] (laughter) and Unitarian Universalism, so I think, you know, my mom probably, I didn't reflect on it as a kid but I do now.  We almost always went to church.  We went to the Unitarian Universalist Church, and I think about that now and I wonder why that was so important, but I suspect it's because she grew up with the ritual of on Sunday morning, you wake up and you go to church.  But, she was very unenamored with religion at that point.  Her experiences in the Latter-day Saints Church left her with a bad taste and then particularly in the South, as a white woman raising a black child, the segregation of Sunday morning services were very real and very painful, so we went to a church that was much more about community than it was about God.  I learned a lot in the Unitarian Church I'm from.  There was not a lot of black, sort of cradled U.U.'s who were raised as Unitarians, but it was nice.  It gave me the ritual, the experience, the practice of going and being part of a worshipping community, but there wasn't any dogma or doctrine.  There wasn't any, I learned a lot of the Bible stories but I learned them right along, stories about not only other world religions but just, I sort of thought of them as literature stories rather than religious stories and I didn't come to have known religious identity until middle school and high school.
Speaker 1: So, you, what was the racial composition of the Unitarian Church where you attended?
Speaker 2: It was vastly predominantly white, I think as most are except for a few congregations I have come to know and love over the years, Chicago [Illinois], and Washington, D.C., and a few of the major metropolitans have very integrated ones.  Ours was quite white, but, like good Unitarians, they understood themselves to be welcoming, open; in fact, it was quite radical to have our little interracial family as part of it and so I know that my mom felt overall as it were, a very welcoming community and, specifically the minister who was a minister during most of my childhood at that Unitarian Church, was really thoughtful and intellectual.  We learned later he had actually been battling alcoholism during much of that time, but I think that also made him, made him soft and forgiving in a way that I think my mom had experienced a lot of religion that was very harsh and very judgmental, and none of that was ever, you know, going on in the Unitarian Church.  I mean, there were weird, racial experiences, but that was true always in Virginia and, again, had much more of an impact on my mom and sister [Elizabeth] than it did on me.
Story_ID: 564890
Speaker 1: Now, can you talk a little bit more about that?  You grew up in a home with a white mother [Diana Gray] and a white sister [Elizabeth] and African American you in the South [Charlottesville, Virginia].  How did your identity form as a young girl?
Speaker 2: And, I also just don't want to miss that at every point also visiting the black home of my dad [William M. Harris, Sr.], who had this very, very strong, I mean who was college roommates with Stokely Carmichael.  They lived on the same hall at Howard [University in Washington, D.C.] and, you know again, who had been at the March on Washington and saw himself as a community organizer and, who also, you know my relationship, my parents' relationship was often marked my race in some really important ways in that my dad constantly was-- had a lot of anxiety about his black child being raised by a white woman and so my mother was very open to--"Okay, so what do I need to do?"--and my dad was very open to telling her-"this is what you need to do."  The most important things that my mom did, I think, around my racial identity, or both of my parents, is there was not, in the 1970s, a notion of biracial identity.  There is now.  It took me a long time to understand that because race is socially constructed that I have to accept other interracial young people.  They really do experience themselves as biracial.  I do not.  I experience myself as a black person with a white parent, and that is because from the beginning that is always how I was described to myself, how my family described me; just, the notion, "biracial" was not a word that was used.  But also, my mother was very concerned that we live in a community that had many African Americans; again, I went to Jackson Via [Elementary School in Charlottesville, Virginia], named after two black women, and it was a predominantly black elementary school, as well as my middle school; maybe not predominantly black, but certainly more than 1/3.  I had black child care providers all through my baby years, who helped to teach my mom how to do my hair and my mom was extraordinary.  She could corn row my hair in extremely fancy styles and beads on the ends, and you know even the little, like, you put the tin foil on the end to keep the beads, my mom did all of that.  And those were very self-conscious decisions made by my parents, sometimes thought out by my parents, about making sure that I was constantly understanding myself as a little black girl, and so I did.  And, there was never, whether that was bad or good, it certainly was very straight forward.  There wasn't a space for a crisis of identity there.
Story_ID: 564891
Speaker 1: Would you tell me what your occupation is?
Speaker 2: The question of what my occupation is is harder than you might imagine.  I think of myself primarily as a college professor, but I am a college professor with the best weekend job ever because I also, at least for now, host a weekend cable kind of news and information show [on MSNBC] which is named after me, which is very strange.  It is named "Melissa Harris-Perry."  When I was first offered the show, I spent a long time writing very long memos about all of the names I would love my show to have and none of them were my name.  I think it is very weird to have me and then me that is the show, but there you go.  I didn't make that decision.  (laughter)
Speaker 1: And where are you a college professor?
Speaker 2: So, right now I teach at Wake Forest University [Winston-Salem, North Carolina], which is my undergraduate alma mater.  I have taught at Princeton [University in Princeton, New Jersey] and the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and Toulane [University in New Orleans, Louisiana] previously, but I am hoping that this is my final academic job.  I am very excited to be back at the place that I think of as my home institution.
Story_ID: 564892
Speaker 1: So I want to go back to your childhood home, growing up experience.  You described going in between the two homes and having your godmother [Kathy Branch (ph.)], who was your father's [William M. Harris, Sr.] wife.  How did that dynamic work?  Was there any acrimony between the adults in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: I mean, I, I came to understand as an adult that there were disagreements between my godmother and my mother [Diana Gray], that there were difficult and harsh times, that there were, but, you know, my godmother is also divorced from my dad at this point and so, like three weekends ago, my godmom was at the house, holding my baby and, you know, my mom and my godmother were together, basically, rolling their eyes about my dad so, you know, women in their thirties raising their young children and the difficulty of what that context must have been, simultaneously trying to create loving households for their children, but also loving the same really charismatic, extraordinary, smart, big personality man that is my father.  It must have been very hard, but I just, I really did not experience it as a kid; I mean, I felt completely as loved and joyously accepted and embraced by my godmother as by my mom, and by my sisters and siblings on my dad's side as by my mom, and I really to this day feel that way.  Again, my godmother was at my home holding my baby daughter three weeks ago, and so I don't, again, I really don't know why they did it and I certainly don't know how.  I am not sure that I could accomplish such a task, although my first husband [Dennis Lacewell] after our divorce, did have a child with the woman that, as far as I can put together the time table, he did basically leave me for, and that child is my oldest child's brother, and I don't feel any, I mean I could tomorrow have them all for Thanksgiving.  Maybe not my ex-husband, but I could certainly have the mother of his child and that child at my table and not have any negative feelings at all.  In fact, I would kind of like to see that kid again.  I used to see him a lot when he was very little and my ex-husband would come to pick my daughter up and would sometimes have the little boy with him.  But, we were divorced by the time that child was born and my godmother remained married to my father until I was in college, so how she never did and still doesn't seem to have any negative feelings towards me, maybe it's because, in fact, I was not a threat to her marriage.  That, in fact, my parents' relationship broke up a decade before, before her marriage did, so maybe it was because whatever threatened her marriage, it actually wasn't me.
Speaker 1: So, when you were growing up in those early years, was your mother still in relationship with your father?
Speaker 2: Uhm-hmm, yes.  Until I was eleven and in sixth grade.  We moved.  My mom had really economically suffered in Charlottesville [Virginia].  She just could not find long-term stable well paid employment, and so she made a decision to move closer to Petersburg, Virginia, so not that far away, but I suspect that the decision to move as much as the distance, was related to the end of their romantic relationship, and so my dad stayed a part of my life forever, still is, very, very critical important part of my life, but their relationship as romantic partners ended right around that same time.

Speaker 1: I want to talk about your growing up as an African American girl in the South with a white mother [Diana Gray].  You identified as African American, yes, but what was the dynamic like for you, just moving about in the South?
Speaker 2: Well, there were, I mean, there were moments when people would say to my mom, now I look just like my mom, just like my mother.  It's, you know, that thing that happens as you get older and you turn into your mother, your voice.  I always looked just like my mom, but people would still presume that I was not her biological child, and so, I can remember being in the, like Safeway Grocery Store and having people say, "So, how long has she been with you?"  My mom would be like, "Since nine months before she was born!" (laughter).  You know, the experiences of, you know, again, walking into a restaurant and having someone seat part of the family but not the other part of it.  My mom had more intense experiences.  I wasn't called the N-word personally until much later.  My sister, who is white [Elizabeth], Oh...she really went through it because...when I walk into a room, I'm always read as black and always have been.  So, when my body enters, whether it is a six month old body or a 60-year-old body, everybody in the room knows they're in the room with a black person and they behave accordingly.  Whether that is well or badly, it is not different, I think, than what most black people experience; but, for white people who are intimately related to black people, when their bodies arrive in the room, the world just sees whiteness.  So they end up experiencing what happens in a room of exclusively white people who do not know that they are basically in the room with a black girl's sister, or with a black woman's mother, and the virile nasty only behind closed doors white racism that my sister and my mom experienced, sometimes directed at that and sometimes second hand, is very different for me because I am my own signal that the room is integrated, but they don't signal that the room is integrated.  People think of themselves as safe in the room with the nice white ladies, and then they would hear of, you know, my sister who loved me, six years apart, and so I was kind of like a little buddy that she would take around, and the kinds of things that the boys in the neighborhood would say to her, or say to her about what her mother had done to make a baby like me, were, I think there is no question that my sister Beth had the most brutal part of that experience.
Speaker 1: And, is this something that you all talked about?  Do you have conversations about this?
Speaker 2: Not until we were much older.  You know, I, my sister left home in high school to go off to dance.  I smile, because she is really a most extraordinary dancer, and she left Charlottesville [Virginia], went to Washington, D. C. to the Public School of the Arts there on Duke Ellington [Duke Ellington School of the Arts in Washington, D.C.], which interestingly enough is also vastly predominantly black, and so where my white sister was like, "Oh, thank God I'm finally with my people" (laughter) which is kind of funny, and they used to call her the vanilla child and so she had a whole different set of experiences at that point, but I sort of understood then that she was leaving because Virginia was not good for her, that she was unhappy, that she was being teased, but I am not sure that I understood until much later as young adults, how much of that was rooted in her being the white girl in this interracial family and having to navigate.  Again, not only racism but a racism I think that was directed at her as an adolescent very differently than me as a child.  Again, it takes a special kind of racist to say something horrifying to a five-year-old.  Not that it doesn't happen, but by the late 1970s, when the good South is trying, like you have to be really special to, but if you are in school with thirteen-year-old boys, then you can bet that thirteen -year-old boys who it doesn't take much at all to get them to say horrible things to other thirteen -year-old girls in general, that if they have the race piece too, that the kinds of things she had to hear and listen to and respond to were just much more brutal.

Speaker 1: Now you described your father [William M. Harris, Sr.] as a Black Nationalist.
Speaker 2: (laughter) yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about his influence on you in his thinking?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, my dad influences me in so many ways.  Like, my workaholism is from my father, my intensity is from my father, my, you know, like constantly wanting, in my household, my mother [Diana Gray] would always say, "I love you and I'm proud of you."  I mean, you could just go and make a slop of your life and mom will go, "I love you and I'm proud of you."  My father loves you, he always loves you.  But, proud of you?  You have to earn that.  You have to, you know.  I would come home, "I've got five As and a B." First, "What's the B in?"  So, my dad is a perfectionist, and he also understood that perfectionism, still I think does, as related to the responsibilities of the race. So, this is a man who came through the Jim Crow South, who earned a Ph.D., who became the first Dean of African American Affairs [at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia], who did all of that with no trail being blazed for him.  He was the trail blazer and so, for us as the children, children he understood as basically children of privilege because we are coming.  He was first generation.  We have a college professor for a dad!  So, the expectations of how you should achieve academically, of who you should be, of how you should carry yourself, and most importantly, more than anything else, how you relate to the race; whether or not you are a person who is at the core of your work, of your professional life.  My dad does not care if you are rich.  My dad does not care if you buy a big house.  My father does not care if, there are two things he cares about.  Are you a good parent to your children, and are you a good race man or race woman.  And, you know, you could, you could be in debt, although I don't think he thinks you'd be a good parent if you were in debt, but you could be.  You could be in debt.  You certainly could be living in poverty, but if you were doing so to organize the people, if you were doing so while working hard every day, we lost, this year we lost my brother-in-law.  My eldest sister's husband died after a very long illness and my father eulogized my brother-in-law and, it's a bit of a long story.  Basically my brother-in-law was adopted into his family and so my father, in his eulogy, was saying that he wasn't only adopted into that family, he wasn't only a Tatwalla [ph.], he was also a Harris, that we had adopted him.  And so, he talked about what a Harris is, and I never heard my dad actually lay out the things that a Harris is, but at the core of what a--
Story_ID: 564895
Speaker 1: So, I was saying that when my brother-in-law passed the summer, we asked my father [William M. Harris, Sr.] to give the eulogy and it was interesting because, you know, my dad is intense and he is a college professor and so occasionally he gives lectures and so we've heard a lot of his stories over the years, but he, in talking about Nathan, decided to say that we had adopted Nathan and that Nathan, in fact, was a Harris just like us.  And so, in order to do that he had to describe what a Harris is, and I had never, I mean, my dad does say all through my life outrageous things about what Harrises are, and so he'll say things like, I can remember in college I sent him a letter and asked him for a new, I asked him for a new alarm clock because (laughter) roommate had stepped on mine and broken it and his response was, "Harrises don't need alarm clocks to wake up.  No Harris has ever needed an alarm clock to wake up!" (laughter) and I was like, "What? Okay."  So that is, you know, he actually laid out the things that Harrises are.  He said that there were three key components, and the two that I just want to identify here are "Courage."  Harrises have courage.  And so, he talked about my brother-in-law and how he faced his illness and the kind of courage that it took, both to come from very resource-deprived circumstances that my brother-in-law had come from and then to make family and to make life, and also once he had a terminal diagnosis, to nonetheless keep going in life and facing it with such joy and the kind of courage that that was; and then, the second thing that I want to highlight here was he said "Work."  What Harrises do is work, and he was right about this in terms of my brother-in-law.  Even after he got a terminal diagnosis, they basically had to kick him off the job.  He wanted to go to work.  He wanted to provide for his family and so my dad, in defining who we are as people, really wanted to highlight this idea that we are courageous people and we are hard-working people, and I am looking at my sister as this is happening and, I said, "Yeah, I think he has always said that to us."  It is never quite like that, but, yeah, the idea that you are meant to be courageous and you are meant to work hard.  Those were critical lessons we learned.
Story_ID: 564896
Speaker 1: Now, when you, you've talked about the relationship between your parents, your mother [Diana Gray] and father [William M. Harris, Sr.] and that your mother, in a way, was like a single parent.  Was your father contributing to your household?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't think he contributed much financially.  He contributed some.  He certainly, there was some sort of child support agreement between them.  I don't think it had anything to do with the courts for a wide variety of reasons.  And, he contributed, you know, when I was younger, he contributed even more emotionally.  He used to come over, like I have very distinct memories of my dad on Sundays, that's why I love football, he would come on Sundays and he would sit in front of the, you know, pull up his big chair.  It was green because it was the '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s] and he would watch the football game and I would sit and watch football with him and that is kind of how I learned to love football.  You know, the older I got, particularly once my sister [Elizabeth] had moved out to go off to high school [Duke Ellington School of the Arts] in [Washington] D. C. and once I was in middle school, my dad was much more absent emotionally.  It was not a, you know, I realize now what a good dad my father is for an adult.  He is a really great adult dad.  You can call my dad for advice.  He, he'll read my paper, we've written an article together.  He is a great parent for an adult, but he, but I don't think he had a clue of what to do, especially with adolescent girls.  When we were little, he'd roughhouse and play and then we went through that period of, kind of, eight to about, oh eighteen, where he just...I don't know, and then once we became adults and we could have adult conversations, then he was kind of back in the game.  But I don't think he was much of a financial supporter.  He still isn't.  I quite distinctly remember my father on my first wedding day, handing my new husband [Dennis Lacewell] and I a check and looking at my new husband and saying, "This is the last dollar you will get from me, because this is your wife now and so you are responsible.  Go make life."  And then, I went through a very brutal and extremely expensive divorce, and Daddy was right there and helped me to write checks because then I didn't have a husband anymore, and so my Daddy was there, and then when I married my second husband, he was like, "good job, James [Perry].  This is your wife."  And I haven't seen another dollar.  He sends money to my daughters for their birthdays and that kind of thing, and we put them in a special account, and I certainly don't need his financial contribution, but it's also true that my dad is not, like my mom, she would go and sell something in order to make sure that you had tuition money to go back to school, but that was, my dad was like, "So you will need to get a second job in order to do that."  So, I suspect my dad did not contribute much financially.
Speaker 1: He sounds pretty old school in some ways.
Speaker 2: In lots of ways, yes (laughter).
Story_ID: 564897
Speaker 1: You describe him [William M. Harris, Sr.] as a Black Nationalist.  I'm just curious, being married to a black woman, being a Black Nationalist, and having a white woman with whom he has a child, what do you think that relationship was with his wife.  Could you describe that?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm pretty sure it was a prerequisite to have a white woman if you are a Black Nationalist.  (laughter).  I can't actually think of one that doesn't.  Nope, they all do.  I don't really know why, I am sure there is some deep psycho-political, social stuff going on there.  Look, my godmother [Kathy Branch (ph.)], his first wife, was his high school sweetheart, right?  I mean, they were, as far as I know, they went to high school, maybe even middle school together.  They married by the time, you know she was eighteen, at least.  You know, they had three kids before he was out of college so, you know, I, but I will say this: they are now in their seventies, the two of them.  And they still talk on the phone almost every day and they still have intertwined, I mean, they have children and grandchildren together.  My family is just, I guess I don't really understand families where people judge each other out of relationship, because it is just not what we do and it is in part why, as judgmental as I am politically, and I really am, I really believe even right and wrong a lot politically, there is, and there are moral and personal truths that I hold, but they tend to be things like courage, hard work, honesty, not one man/one woman.  I, I just don't get it, because my family was so full of love that anyone who would judge it from the outside as inherently problematic because it doesn't fit a particular model of marriage, is so limited.  For me, that means that you must not get what love is.  If you don't look at my family and see love, then you are clearly the one who is confused.  And so, we just weren't raised with, you know, that kind of shame.  And so I don't know precisely what their relationship was, but clearly it was loving in that all these years later, they maintained relationship and my dad is not an easy, he is just not easy.  He is hard and demanding and exacting and difficult and sometimes, just mean.  But, he is also my daddy and so here we go.  We all love him and kind of figure out how to navigate relationships with him.
Story_ID: 564898
Speaker 1: You talked about your sister [Elizabeth], growing up with your sister.  What was, you described the difficulties that she had outside of your house and how she was treated.  What was your relationship like between the two of you?
Speaker 2: I mean, initially, she was my best friend and I was hers.  We are 6-1/2 years apart and, you know, growing up kind of just the three of us, mom [Diana Gray] and the two girls, she is a dancer.  I think I mentioned before, and she taught me to dance and we have, like, community talent shows in which we would dress alike and dance, we won a blue ribbon at one of them.  My sister, because she was a dancer and performer, is also just the most wonderful person.  You just want to be around her.  She is very tall.  She has long, gorgeous blonde hair.  She has enormous blue eyes.  She has legs, as long as I am tall, so she is like supermodel gorgeous, talented, and very, very, very dramatic, and so as a kid, like she could sew all the doll clothes and she would arrange all the Smurfs in this, like she had this dramatic presentation of the Smurfs in her bedroom so, like, as a young kid, I wanted to go in and play with her Smurfs and, so we were best, best friends, I would say until, and I realize now, she was 13 or 14 and I was 6, 7, 8 and then, of course, I was a horrifying little sister who would do things like look at her diary and tease her about her, you know, imperfect adolescent skin because I was eight and she was thirteen, so I can't imagine any sisters, and then I would steal her clothes, then wear her clothes because they were more fashionable than mine and she would come home and find that I had worn a new shirt that she hadn't even worn yet, you know, and then there is a whole story of her shaking me while I'm asleep in the bed because I don't know, maybe at that point I'm 13 and she's 19, and she's home from college and I borrowed her, I can't remember if I borrowed her coat or her shirt or some other such thing, but just sister stuff.  We then went through kind of a long period, because she then moved to California.  She did law school out in California and she started her life and her family out in California and we just didn't see each other much for years and we are only now, as adult women, both of us on our second marriages, both of us raising children who are twelve years apart because we have one child from our first marriage and then, let me see, all of us, my oldest sister who is twelve years older, my sister Beth, who is six years older, and me, we all had first marriages in which we had one set of kids and then we got married again at forty and had these second kids and we all do, like the old mama dance. (laughter) And now, sort of, as an adult person seeing the things and the courageous choices that my sister made over the years, I have such an appreciation for her and our kids are friends and so that's the other part of it.  It's like you come back into relationship because the cousins love each other.
Speaker 1: As you were growing up, did you ever have race questions, challenges between you?
Speaker 2: I think only that she is so much the epitome of what is beautiful.  I mean, my sister is jaw-dropping, when I am going to introduce her to people for the first time who have known me and, in fact, she came to visit the show ["Melissa Harris-Perry" on MSNBC] for the first time and the people at the show have met my mom [Diana Gray], and they have met my other sibling, they have met my cousins, all of this, and I said, "Okay, my sister is coming."  I said, "This is the super model wing of the family.  It can be disturbing for people (laughter).  We just want you to be ready as a really gorgeous white woman is going to come in and that is my sister" and it can be off-putting for folks because they don't, they don't always get what's about to happen and, in fact, one of my dearest sort of confidantes on the producer team, she went, "I'm so glad you told us." She was like, "Yeah, she really is."  She was like, "If I had just seen this woman walking through the halls no matter what, my jaw would have dropped."  So, I think there were times for me, especially when I then was going through awkward adolescence, when having a sister who was not only beautiful but beautiful in a very normative American blonde-hair, blue-eyed way, was, I just felt very invisible standing next to her, but that was more about what other people were doing.  That wasn't between us.  I mean, you know, at home, she was just Beth, you know.  We maybe had one race fight.  It was when I was in college.  You may go off to the year in college and you read Frances Cress Welsing, "The Isis Papers," which now has a totally different sound because of the terrorist organization, but you know it is kind of a Black Nationalist text about race and, you know, you're a freshman and so you don't really have any complex analytic space by which to both receive, but also be critical of it and so I think maybe I came back from my first semester of college and just repeated "The Isis Papers" to my white sister, who was probably like, "Are you mad?" "Have you gone crazy?" Particularly someone who, again I don't know that I recognized it as a freshman in college, had been the front lines of taking so much of the racist angst of our childhood.  She had encountered it and then I am going to come and tell her about oppression.  I am sure that that was annoying, but that fight was more of a sister fight, more of a "How dare you six years younger than me come and repeat to me something and not listen to me as your big sister?"  It felt much more like that than like some kind of race battle.
Story_ID: 564899
Speaker 1: I want you to tell me about your education.  So you mentioned that your elementary school [Jackson Via Elementary School in Charlottesville, Virginia] was across the street.  Did your sister [Elizabeth] also go to that same school?
Speaker 2: No, because I guess for maybe a year.  So by the time we moved, let's see if I was three she would have been 9-1/2, so I think she did one, she probably did fifth grade there, but then she was off to the other, to the middle and high school.
Speaker 1: So you didn't have the experience of following in her footsteps in school.
Speaker 2: No, not really.
Speaker 1: What was school like for you?  Were there teachers that stood out for you?
Speaker 2: Oh very much.  Emma Knight [ph.], kindergarten, African American woman.  I have a thing about my name.  I love my name.  I think parents help us to love our names by first thing that you learn to read by sight and, in fact, my sister Beth had painted my name, Melissa, M-E-L-I-S-S-A, on a green board in yellow writing.  It still hangs over my desk right now, but it hung over my bed and so I learned it. My name is M-E-L-I-S-S-A.  Kindergarten, I go in and all the cubbies are set up and our names are on our cubbies, and I can't find my cubby because my name had been spelled M-E-L-I-S-A, just one "S."  But, when you're four, as I was, you don't know to, like you're reading by sight.  It's not phonetic, so, if I don't see M-E-L-I-S-S-A, I don't recognize that the one with the one "S" is just my name spelled wrong, and I was devastated.  I thought it wasn't my class.  I thought I was in the wrong place.  My names was not--I didn't have a cubby.  And, Emma Knight, my kindergarten teacher, recognized what it was, came over, fixed it, fixed my name, and she was my little champion forever.  I, I will never forget her basically being the first person in any kind of educational setting to say, "Well, no, you belong here.  Here, I'm gonna literally put your name on your cubby so that you'll know you belong here."  So, that was Emma Knight, kindergarten.  My third grade teacher, Mrs. Teague, Roberta Teague [ph.], white woman with very short red hair, who as incredible and Roberta Teague taught me that what is going on in the classroom is one thing and education is something different.  She used to take, especially with the next year fourth grade when I did not have a good teacher, she would, free of charge because my mom [Diana Gray] was a single parent, she would take me and another girl who she has identified as gifted, out after school and give us extra projects and kind of keep our excitement and enthusiasm for learning up, but it was in Roberta Teague's class where I put together a whole performance of the child's play, "Annie" and I cast all my friends and my dog and we performed it after school.  It was quite intensive, a cast party, it was dramatic.  (laughter).  Seventh grade, English, Mrs. Erickson [ph.].  So, seventh grade English, Mrs. Erickson, and this is after we moved and, in fact, I saw Mrs. Erickson.  She came and held my daughter who is seven months old.  She came to New Orleans [Louisiana] for a jazz fest and held my daughter not two or three months ago.  Mrs. Erickson used to teach "The Hobbit" [by J.R.R. Tolkien] to all the seventh graders and it was the first time anybody ever took me through a book that way, just to really work through literary analysis, and then you had to pick a character from "The Hobbit" and you had to be that character at the end of the school year and I, of course, was the treasure and I showed up in this outfit and told the whole story of "The Hobbit" from the perspective of the treasure and she just loved that and I loved her back, and she is undoubtedly the reason I was an English major ultimately in college, and then there was Mr. Ramzire [ph.], tenth grade English.
Story_ID: 564900
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Tenth grade.
Speaker 1: Tenth grade English, Mr. Ramzire [ph.].  Mr. Ramzire taught us the "Scarlet Letter", which I will always remember, but also Mr. Ramzire encouraged us to write so I wrote my first novel, which no one should ever read and which was not published.  These days, undoubtedly, Mr. Ramzire would have had us, you know, like e-publishing it or something, but it was really Mr. Ramzire who made me think about writing, not just reading; and then, I want to go back, just one more person in middle school and I can't remember if he was seventh grade or eighth grade social studies.  I think, Mr. Spain [ph.], and (laughter) Mr. Spain taught us, you know, that the Confederate Army was, you know, a bunch of really good guys and that the Civil War was "The War of Northern Aggression" and I fought with Mr. Spain every day.  I cannot remember if it was seventh or eighth grade, but I was in middle school doing battle with my social studies teacher.  One of my most enjoyable life experiences was to find out, actually from Mrs. Erickson [ph.], all these many years later, thirty years later, that he is a major watcher of the alternate network and really hates my show very much (laughter) which I just love that!  So, it's funny because this is a teacher who, on the one hand, like, apparently disliked me then, certainly dislikes me now, disagreed with me in every way, but I made good grades in his class and fighting with him, arguing with him, hearing his viewpoint and pushing back against it is probably even more important--I don't know if it is more important--it was an important part of the educational experience and, in fact, many of the teachers I think of as most influential are ones that I had very contentious relationships with because learning to be in a contentious relationship with someone who is empowered over you seems to me like a crucial aspect of education.  I watch myself as a parent having to be careful not to try to protect my daughter from teachers that she either doesn't like or, and instead, try to encourage her to go ahead and engage, you know, a teacher who is troubling--always respectfully, so when I say I was fighting with him, we weren't spitting or throwing things but, in part because that person is empowered, you have to come with your best argument against that teacher, so those were, you know, Emma Knight [ph.], kindergarten, and Mrs. Teague [ph.], and Mrs. Erickson [ph.], and Mr. Ramzire [ph.], and, old Mr. Spain undoubtedly.  And then, in college, really extraordinary teachers in college.
Story_ID: 564901
Speaker 1: As a child, what did you envision you would do with your life?
Speaker 2: Oh, all kinds of different things.  When I learned about King Tut, I thought I would be an anthropologist or archaeologist, and then I found out that one has to have enormous patience to be an archaeologist and I am many things, and patient is not one of them.  For a while, I wanted to be a psychiatrist or a psychologist, and then I realized you have to let other people talk more than you talk, and that is not something I'm very good at.  When I got to college, I wanted to be a novelist and I thought that I would write fiction, and then I read, really read Toni Morrison and read [William] Faulkner, and I realized I only wanted to be a novelist if I could be that good, and that I wasn't even in the (laughter) neighborhood of being that good and so--nope.  So, I think there are all kinds of different things I wanted to be.  I didn't want to be a college professor until I was actually on my way to becoming one.  It wasn't as though I sat around and dreamed about being a college professor.
Story_ID: 564902
Speaker 1: So--can you tell me about your going to college--how you made the choice where you went to college?
Speaker 2: Okay, so, a lot of, maybe this goes, I was talking before about not shaming.  It is in part because I've had an enormous amount of success, much of it undeserved, and undeserved in the sense that I often made very good decisions for very bad reasons.  So, I don't have a high school diploma.  I dropped out of high school [Thomas Dale High School in Chester, Virginia] after my third year.  I went to my freshman, sophomore, and junior year of high school and then I decided that I was going to go to college and that I didn't want to finish high school, and there are lots of reasons for this.  In part, I think my junior year teacher is, like, the last great teacher I can tell you about was my tenth grade English teacher and then my junior year I didn't feel like I had great teachers and I felt like it was starting to kind of wrap up.  I had done basically all of the requirements, and so I was going to end up spending about a third of that year in community college classes that you would take outside of the high school, and it seemed silly to be taking community college classes if I could just take college classes.  I got a, like a notice, after I had taken my PSATs.  I had gotten a notice from this college, Simon's Rock of Bard College [Bard College at Simon's Rock in Great Barrington, Massachusetts], that the whole college was kids who left after either their sophomore or junior year and started college early and I didn't want to go to Massachusetts, but I started doing research about other schools that would accept you early, so I made very, very few applications because I didn't even have a high school diploma.  But, the real, true, honest, if I want to just get real about the reason I left high school is because my high school boyfriend was a year older than me and once he was graduating I didn't really see any particular point (laughter) in being in high school and that's awful, and is so not feminist, and I would be appalled if my daughter made a decision similarly, but the truth is once Boogie was not going to be in school anymore, I couldn't particularly think of a reason to go to school, and so I applied at that time to Wake Forest [University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina], and to [College of] William and Mary [Williamsburg, Virginia], and to Harvard [University in Cambridge, Massachusetts]; those are the three schools.  And, so many, growing up in Virginia, so many of my friends went to William and Mary and I loved William and Mary and I went and visited it.  It also felt like I would be returning to a place where lots of kids from my high school went.  No one I had ever heard of had gone to Wake Forest before.  But when I went to Wake Forest and I visited that campus, it looked like every mental image of what college should be that I have ever formed.  It reminded me in certain ways of kind of the red brick colonial style of the University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia], and [HM] Maya Angelou was a professor there, and I thought, "Well, maybe I'll get a class with her" and so, sure enough, went to--and also, the high school boyfriend was going to school at Chapel Hill, and so I figured (laughter) he'd be close by--it's horrible, I can't... But those were things I thought about at 16, so I went off to college at 16 with no high school diploma.
Speaker 1: And-and you, so, how did you pay for college?
Speaker 2: Ummm.  Full scholarship from Wake Forest University; so, yeah I should not leave that part of it out because that, that was also critically important in the decision making.  They were, Wake was in a time when it was really heavily investing in diversifying its student body, and there was a minority fellows scholarship available.  I had the grades and scores, and they paid for it all.  There was a gap each year that would grow, you know, because, they paid tuition, room, and board, and then the next year, you know tuition increased, so there is a little gap each and every year and so, I would--I worked lots of jobs in college to make up that gap.  I think I took maybe 2,000 dollars in student loans and I think my mom [Diana Gray] took some Parent Plus Loans that were maybe another 5,000-something, but we certainly paid for what ended up being about a 100,000 dollar education for well less than 10,000 dollars, yeah.
Story_ID: 564903
Speaker 1: Now, you've mentioned feminism.  When do you think the seeds of feminism were planted and do you know how?
Speaker 2: Oh, well.  They were planted by my mom [Diana Gray].  I mean, my mom is a good old-fashioned second generation feminist who, you know, she worked and made sure that abortions were safe and legal and my mom was, you know, worked like in graduate school [University of Washington in Seattle, Washington]to make sure that they hire women faculty.  Like, she is just down the line, you know, second wave feminist and, but I didn't, she didn't, I'm not sure that she used that language to talk about herself, but certainly she planted the seeds there.  And then, my college years [at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina] I never would have used the language of feminism to describe myself.  I was so engaged in college in my racial identity and in discovering it, in solidifying it, in politicizing it, so I was a member of multiple campus organizations.  Some of them were black women's organizations but the key was race.  You know, we were race women there to help the blacks.  It was not until graduate school that I identified feminism as part of my, sort of, identity.  But even though I wouldn't have used the language of feminism to talk about myself as a college student; I mean, my college mentors were, themselves, black feminists and me reading all kinds of things that I realize now influenced and impacted that political identity.
Speaker 1: Who were they?
Speaker 2: So, Dolly McPherson was my primary college advisor.  I was an English major at Wake.  Dr. McPherson has since passed, but she taught a couple of critically important classes in black literature.  One of them was a course in autobiography, and another one was a course in African American politics, another course in southern, excuse me, not African American politics but African American literature.  But we read Pauline ["Pauli"] Murray, we read bell hooks, and we read [HM] Maya Angelou; so, I'm not even sure that Dolly McPherson called herself a feminist, but she made us read these black women writers and--[HM] Angela Davis and Alice Walker, and I mean all of it--and then Maya Angelou was my other primary advisor in college.  I worked for her as her student assistant for three years.  I took multiple courses with her.  I ate Thanksgiving with her (laughter) for a decade and, again, I don't know that Dr. Angelou leads with her feminism, which is to say it's not clear to me that Dr. Angelou says, you know, that Dr. Angelou said "I am a black feminist," but she is and what she did say pretty regularly and wonderfully was "So glad I was born a black woman, because if I had been born anything else I would be so jealous".  She said that a thousand times during my college experience, and so that idea that what else would anyone ever want to be, was all sort of embedding in those years in college.
Story_ID: 564904
Speaker 1: Now you described that your racial identity was something that you cultivated while at Wake Forest [University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina].  Can you, can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Oh, so, this is Wake Forest from '90 [1990] to '94 [1994], and it's a time when the University has a couple of, I think, critical things happening.  One, it has a cohort of black faculty, Dolly McPherson, Herman Eure in biology, Alton Pollard in religion, [Anthony] Tony Parent in history, Eddie Pearson in sociology, and you see there are cross disciplines.  They were all, I realize now, probably about where I am right now, so maybe early fulls [full professors], late associate, some of them just getting tenure, but they were that very productive part of your academic life, when you were teaching a 1,000 classes and you are publishing and you are reading all the literature, like you are, you are not the brand new person who is struggling to get tenure, and you are not the professor who is kind of, you know, finishing up.  They're right in that core active moment.  Then, we were a small campus and then in addition to being a small campus, our African American population was, there was a large proportion of it that were Division 1 athletes, so, our football and basketball team.  So, the black students who were non-, kind of D-1 athletes, a very small population.  We were 200 kids and most of us scholarship students, many of us from the South, many of us raised by that generation that are civil rights activists.  We were not having it.  We got to campus, this Southern Baptist, genteel, you know, fraternity laden campus where the Kappa Alpha Fraternity was still having old South parties, and we were like, "Uh-uh.  I betcha' you won't."  And so, we had this incredible Black Student Alliance president, Marc Dalton, who has gone to be a incredible physician.  We had this activist core of black faculty who were right engaged in their own scholarship at that time, and we got organized and so, I later met people who.  I'm a Delta--I'm a member of Delta Sigma Theta [Sorority], and I later met people who sort of poo-pooed that fraternities and sororities don't do much and, also later found that there are many fraternity and sorority chapters where they don't, but on my campus Deltas and Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] and AKAs [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority], were, I mean we were like the center, yes, of parties, but also of the activism on campus.  We were doing that at the same time that in North Carolina, we were a small population of black students in a town with Winston-Salem State University [Winston-Salem, North Carolina] where Bennett [College in Greensboro, North Carolina] and A and T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical University in Greensboro, North Carolina] were up the road, so you had these large black student populations and we're like "What is wrong with y'all? (laughter).  We are in college just being black, and y'all are over there having to worry about being black all the time, and so we have all this angst about ourselves as black students, vis-a-vis students at the HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities].  We had all this all this angst about ourselves as black students, vis-a-vis the white students on campus, particularly those white students who came from these troubling southern traditions, and we were the children of the Civil Rights generation; so, those years we spent a lot, we occupied the vice president's office, we'd walk around with black arm bands, we would, you know, have meetings about what we were going to do about the deans and, I mean, it was where I learned to use a phone tree.  There was no email.  You know, use a phone tree, call a meeting, have a protest, ask for, you know, make demands, all of that I learned in college.
Speaker 1: And, as an English major, where were you envisioning that would lead you?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I came to college thinking I was going to be a novelist and I was going to write books and figured out pretty quickly I wasn't, and then settled in to realizing that being an English major meant that you were going to have four years where you were expected to read all the books that an educated person is meant to read, and that you will never, ever read again.  You just, except for a very few highly disciplined individuals, if you don't read Shakespeare in college, I mean read Shakespeare in college, you're never gonna read Shakespeare.  You're gonna kinda know that story of Romeo and Juliet, but you're not going to read historical Shakespeare.  You're not going to read the sonnets.  I mean, before I left home yesterday I wrote a sonnet on my husband's [James Perry] chalkboard.  One of the walls of his office is painted with chalkboard paint and so I wrote a sonnet that I know by heart, because we are English majors and so, I sort of ended up just kind of falling into it and enjoying that I wasn't ever going to do anything with it, but I think that's part of the genius of Wake Forest.  Because it is a truly liberal arts college, it does not ask you to know what you're going to do with it.  It just asks you to learn, and so I, I'm not sure what I thought I was going to do but I was having a good time reading all the, reading all the everything.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 564905
Speaker 1: And then, you decided to go to graduate school [Duke University in Durham, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Uhm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Can you describe that.
Speaker 2: I did, so I took a couple of political science courses in college [Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina]; in fact, it ended up being my minor and it seemed much more like a thing that one could do (laughter) other than just read books, which is my English major.  So, but I wasn't at all thinking about a Ph.D. at that point, so I initially applied and went to graduate school for a Masters of Public Policy; again, I am my father's [William M. Harris, Sr.] child and you, in the world you help people and one of the ways you can help people, you can make a difference, is through public policy, and so I went off to graduate school to get a master's in public policy with the thought that I would make important government decisions.  I got through about the first semester of public policy school and it was like "Oh....this is training me to bureaucrat.  I am about to die."  But, it taught me statistics.  I took Intro to Stats [Statistics] 1 and 2, which, as an English major I had never taken.  I took micro- and macro- economics, things I had never taken as an English major.  So, it forced me to engage with this empirical quantitative data analysis (whispers) and I really--loved it, hated it.  Hated it and loved it!  It turns out I was quite good at it and always, like the English major part of my brain is fighting back against the idea that there is a one answer, but it is incredibly gratifying to come up with an actual answer.  I can't think of a better way to be trained than to have read Annie Dillard all through college and then in grad school get to do macroeconomics, and that was really what happened for me.  But, I did figure out pretty quickly that I did not want to go into public policy.  I did an internship at HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development].  It was great and also made me feel like if I have to wake up in the morning and go to a government building in some high heels and panty hose, I will not survive it.  Thank God, there are people who want to be dentists and want to work for HUD, and I did not want to do either one of those things!  So, I never finished, I did one year of that program and then jumped from Duke's public policy program into the Ph.D. program in political science, because it felt like it was connected to those questions of "How do we find answers?  How do we make government work better?  How do we make the world work better for people?  How do we address inequality, marginal peoples," but with big ideas, not with spread sheets.  So, the difference of the Ph.D. training was, for me, the public policy training was really about finding the answers, and the Ph.D. training was about asking the questions and that was that combination of the English major and the public policy student that came together in a synergy that finally worked for me, and from the moment I found that doctoral program in political science, I was a "pig in mud".  Thrilled.  I just, I had incredible advisors.  I was blessedly ignorant of the fact that no black woman had ever gotten a Ph.D. from that program.  If I had known that, I probably would not have gone and, thank goodness I went, because the people who were there supported me and carried me through it and I--it turns out--I was pretty good at it.
Story_ID: 564906
Speaker 1: And, so your dissertation...
Speaker 2: Uhm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Can you describe your dissertation and what your topic was?
Speaker 2: Well, basically the dissertation is the first book, or (laughter) a much less sophisticated version of the first book.  I actually spelled my name wrong on purpose on my dissertation so that it would be filed in a way that would make it difficult for people to find someday because it was so poorly written in the sense of, like actually, written.  I was still just forming the ideas.  By the time if became the first book, "Barbershops, Bibles, and BET," it was much better formed and much more sophisticated.  But it's basically a book that seeks to empirically demonstrate something that I think is fairly obvious to most black people, which is simply not all black people think alike politically.  We are informed by very deep historical traditions of disagreement and that disagreement is masked by a partisan similarity; so, for most of the first century of black citizenship from the 1860s to 1960s, we are overwhelmingly Republican as a people, and then almost overnight we become overwhelmingly Democratic in terms of our partisanship as a people.  But those massive similarities in our partisanship mask, so much contestation underneath, and so what I was interested in isn't, you know, are there enough black conservatives to someday give Republicans 20% of the black vote--I mean, that is an interesting question, but that wasn't the book.  The book was really about being a black conservative even if you're voting Democratic; being a black feminist, being a black integrationist, being a black nationalist, and those four ideologies and how they get formed and how they get formed in the context of the conversations we have internally as black folks.  So, we have lots of conversations with white folks across an interracial divide that matters, but the stuff of working out who we are, what we want, what's important, how do we get it, who are our leaders, what is good for the race, what is bad for the race, what is the race, who gets to be in it, who gets to get kicked out of it, who sold out, who is--those conversations happen usually when there are no white folks listening or around.  They happen in barbershops, they happen in our churches, they happen in our household.  You know, I like to say that the book was basically about my last three years of college because my African American women girlfriends and I found that a house called the Nia House [at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina], twelve black women living together because we got tired of what was going on in the residence halls at Wake Forest, we founded this house, we all lived together, and we spent three years fighting every week about the world and about what was good, and when I say fighting I mean only discursively, like these are still some of my dearest friends but man, we were fighting about whether or not these things were good or bad for us as a people, and what our role was and what leadership looked like and whether you should go to a black college or a white one, and, you know, whether it matters if you get married before you have kids or not, and whether football and sports are good aspirations or bad ones for the race.  I mean, like, all of it, and it so informed who we were politically, and so I sort of took that as a set of theories and then did all this empirical work around them for the dissertation and, ultimately for the first book.
Story_ID: 564907
Speaker 1: Now, you mention Nia House, and Nia meaning "purpose," correct?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That tells you how black nationalist I was in college that, because as a feminist now I would never name something after Kwanzaa, because I have a lot of anxiety about [HM] Maulana Karenga, but I have none of it at 18.  At 18, we were like "KWANZAA!!" and we were just down with it because that's where we were at 18 (laughter).
Speaker 1: Just trying to understand that context.
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And so, this group of women, these twelve women that you were discussing these ideas, as you discussed them, what did you do with that, in that space?
Speaker 2: Hmmm.  Don't know how much we did with them then.  I mean, certainly all of us were active on campus [Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina], but there was, if there was one thing we used to say all the time it was, "you know, we need unity and we can't be apathetic."  It's funny, because I am, perhaps, the person most likely now to argue against unity as essential to organizing; in fact, I should think contestation is more important than unity.  But even walking through that part of my intellectual development was, was really important.  I don't know that we did much with it in that moment, but when you look at us now, so that's where we were at 18, 19, and 20.  And so, who we are as 40-year-old women include  OB-GYNs and civil rights lawyers, someone who runs a foundation and that makes grants for community organizers all throughout the South and college professors and, in fact, many of us went on to be college professors; either us, or the husbands who we married who were also often hanging out at the Nia House parties (laughter) after, afterward, and though, you know, so all of us as men and women have, in so many ways, like embodied in our work thereafter, those same conversations coming out in different places sometimes, but, like nobody just went on to get rich and be corporate.  Some people went on and became wealthy, but it was, you still see people doing the work in all of it, yeah.
Story_ID: 564908
Speaker 1: When you describe your evolving ideo--thinking.  You mention [HM] Maulana Karenga who, at that time, was huge.  Kwanzaa was very, very big.  Can you describe your evolution in concept from Nia and in alignment with Karenga, too, your thinking when you got to "Barbershop, Bibles, and BET?"
Speaker 2: So, I was in college [Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina] and doing all this activism, and, or what I understand to be activism, campus protests, you know, kind of campus as a laboratory, all of that is around race.  We are identified, in fact, we threw campus Kwanzaa every year, we saw ourselves as bringing racial presence to the campus.  I did, I did almost nothing with women's organizing on campus.  Now, I took women's studies classes, I read bell hooks, but I, in my actual work I did almost nothing around womens'--unless it was black womens--work with an emphasis, probably, on the racial aspect of it.  It was really in graduate school [Duke University in Durham, North Carolina] when I started to identify with two important things; one, that I was a rape survivor which, although it occurred before I ever even left to go to college, I'm really rare--I don't know that I ever really talked about it in college.  I certainly hadn't even disclosed it to my own parents [William M. Harris, Sr. and Diana Gray] until senior year, maybe even, either senior year of college or first year of graduate school before I even disclosed that it had happened, even though it happened when I was fourteen.  I just did not talk about it with any--when I was 14, I told one person, a friend, and no one else until I was about 20.  And so, as I started engaging both my own kind of personal healing around it, started to disclose it, started to think of it as part of my identity as being a sexual assault survivor, that draws you into doing women's work in a different way and I also started reading a lot of work by African American women who were rape survivors and, of course, almost all of us are survivors of rape at the hands of men who are black, because everyone is most likely to be sexually assaulted within the context of their own race.  It's not that men are most, that black men are most likely to be rapists, but they are most likely to be the rapists of black women, just as white men are most likely to be the rapists of white women.  The--"We must save the endangered black man, we must rally all together, our unity is more important than anything else"--starts to fall apart when you are willing to be very honest about the amount of intra-racial gender violence, and it was something that even though I had experienced it, I just hadn't dealt with it or thought about it, or theorized about it, or put it in the context of my work, and once I started doing that, it forced me to say, "Okay, how do I love the race?  How do I talk about this notion of black masculinity and black manhood, but have a place to talk about what happened to me at the hands of a black man."  And, the more that I did that and the more that I started, you know, you start just following, I try to get my students to read this way--you read one thing and that person mentions something and then you can read that person since you are kind of, you know, doing this intellectual history just through reading what the people that you're reading are reading--and when I started to do that, all of a sudden I realized, Oh, my God!  Every time people would say, I could remember conversations in college where we would say how bad slavery was, in part because black women were raped, and if black women were raped that meant black men could not protect their women.  I could remember these conversations as though the main victim of rape is the man, whose manhood is somehow damaged by this.  I can remember us saying in Kwanzaa, like, "We must protect the black woman who is our community's greatest resource."  Ahhh--she is the community, like, push her over as the resource in part, because black sororities and fraternities come out of an era of uplift.  There is also a lot of weird, like gendered stuff that goes on about being "the backbone," so even though Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] is this black woman's organization, also sometimes reproduces a respectability politics that still has a relatively constrained notion for who black women are, and so you learn those things as mantras that you repeat because you're proud of the organization, and it wasn't until I start reading some of the critiques that I was like, "Oh, yeah, woah.  That is a problem."  So it really, it was this kind of personal moment of changing my identity from, like pan-Africanist, nationalist, black girl, to pan-African nationalist black girl rape survivor, to "Oh-wait a minute, that is going to have to change my whole analysis," and so by the time, and, I'm also by the way encountered Wahneema Lubiano, who made me read a whole bunch of other things and also just made me stop saying certain kinds of things and I met my very best girlfriend [Blair Kelley], who is the second half of my brain and she has never been anybody's nationalist nothing, and so she critiqued and she challenged.  She is a historian, actually a dean at North Carolina State [University in Raleigh, North Carolina] right now, so, as a historian she would push back against some of the kind of ahistorical, racial things I would say and so some of it was my identity, some of it was my friendship, some of it was what I was reading, but, you know, by the time five years of graduate school passed, I had a very, very different world view.
Story_ID: 564909
Speaker 1: So I want to go back, you mention that you are a rape survivor and you didn't tell your parents [William M. Harris, Sr. and Diana Gray] for a long time.
Speaker 2: I don't, still never told my father.  I mean, he watches the show so I guess he knows, but I never said it to my father, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did your family know this person?
Speaker 2: He was our neighbor, which is why I did not tell, so this was after we had moved and my mother had gone through a lot to buy the home, so this is the first time we lived in a single family home.  It was the first home that she herself had purchased and bought, and the fact we built it.  Not a fancy house, just very basic, but it was the home that she built.  A nice little, you know, neighborhood, still two, my two best friends in high school [Thomas Dale High School in Chester, Virginia] lived in that same neighborhood.  This man, his backyard, so we were a corner lot, his backyard abutted ours, and he was a father, African American man, married, was a father of two children and lived there all through my high school, (not my, he wasn't there in high school) high school years, college years.  I finally told, I might be getting this timing a little wrong, I think I told junior or senior year of college [Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina].  I told my mom and then, and it was because she kept bugging me.  Some mail for him had come to our house and she kept asking me, I was home on summer or Christmas break, and she kept asking me to take it over to him and I wouldn't and I'm not, I mean, I'm rebellious but I'm not disobedient like that and she could not under--and finally, she was like, "Take the mail over!" and I spilled why I wouldn't.  Of course, at that point, so much time had passed no one at that point was talking and we just didn't do anything legal, but then, and this now, I'm sure I've got the timing right on this.  This, the second year of graduate school [Duke University in Durham, North Carolina], and this is hard to believe but he actually hit me in the face.  He was walking.  In certain ways this galls me even more because, like, all right, but I was standing in my front yard, it was Christmas, I was coming home.  He was walking his dog past our front yard.  The dog comes into the yard to use the bathroom, which I just saw as --- and so I screamed at him to get his dog off my yard because--Jesus!-- and then he screamed back, came into the yard, we got into each other's face, and he hit me.  So I called the police for that! Right?  End up in court and telling the judge who this person is to me, what he had done to me, and the judge, (unclear) judge says, "well, I mean, I don't know anything about that, if there is any report of anything like that; this just sounds like neighbors and so go home and be nice to each other."  And, basically you know my mom's enjoyment of that neighborhood ended from the time that she knew, so she had enjoyed and loved her neighborhood, she is a gardener, she always loved to garden, but like her garden was the line of their property and so it really, so, part of the reason I never told was because sure enough, once I did and once that happened, it just made the whole experience for everyone there very, very ugly and awful, and it wasn't long after that, after the court thing happened, because even though the judge did nothing, his wife heard me say what I said and people who rape teenagers, grown men who do that, are not single-time perpetrators.  It's never true, and I suspect that as the wife she also understood that he had probably perpetrated in other circumstances, whatever those were, because very shortly thereafter their marriage broke up and the family moved, but yeah, and again, I talk about being a survivor on air, but I have never had a conversation with my father about it.
Story_ID: 564910
Speaker 1: You mentioned your best friend and her influence on you.  Can you tell me who she is and talk about how she helped you think differently?
Speaker 2: So, my best friend is Professor Blair Kelley.  She was Blair Murphy when I met her.  We were, I was in my second year of graduate school [Duke University in Durham, North Carolina].  She was in her first.  She was getting her Ph.D. in history and I was getting mine in political science and we were in a civil rights course together that was like a large lecture that, sort of, all the students from multiple disciplines were taking.  And, there are so, I mean, to ask sort of, what is Blair's influence?  So, my favorite story about how much she became me and I her, is many years later, I'm engaged and living with my fiance in North Carolina, I come home.
Speaker 1: This is Lacewell?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  My fiance Dennis Lacewell.  I-I come home and I hit play on the answering machine and there is my best friend leaving this message to my husband, I mean, my fiance, that is like, "Oh, baby, thinking about you today" and I'm going, and I realize, "Oh, that's not Blair, that's me."  (laughter).  I am literally listening to my own voice, but I sound so much like Blair, that, I think I'm listening to her because especially, at that time we were in graduate school together, we just talked all day, every day, so that we had the same cadence, the same words, the same everything, and in a lot of ways, I think that is just true of who we became to each other.  The most important question that Blair ever asked me was the very first question she asked me, when in graduate school, she said, "So, what do you study?"  I said, "Oh, I study black politics."  Oh, sorry, it was actually the second she asked me.  She said, "What do you study?"  "I study black politics."  And she looks at me and says, "Black politics when??"  Which is, of course, how a historian thinks, right?  Political science is black politics as a field.  You just study black politics throughout time, it's just true.  It's a model.  But, for her, the question is always, well, that "when."  Change over time.  She, umm, is uncompromising in her determination that I am going to be great.  I like to say that she is the Charlotte to my Wilbur [from "Charlotte's Web" by E.B. White].  Whenever I am feeling low or bad, she kind of spins a web over my head that says, "You are some terrific pig."  And it kind of forces me to believe in myself.  She is the first person who identified that I had a particular talent for talking, and I'm sure other people, I mean other people have said it to me later, but she is the first one who said to me, "Melissa, you're a good writer, but you're a great talker.  When people ask you to talk, you should say 'yes.'  If you get an invitation to talk, you should go talk.  See what happens."  And that is pretty much, like, from that moment until TV show was a line of choices, but that all got started from her saying, "Hmm when people ask you to do that, go do that."
Speaker 1: At what age were you when she was saying this to you?
Speaker 2: First year faculty member, so it was, I was at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], which she had also helped me to make the decision to go there as opposed to I had a couple of offers, but I was most weighing an offer between the University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia], where my father had taught and where I felt I could go continue a family legacy, versus the University of Chicago, which scared me to death because I never lived in a big city.  I never lived outside the South, and it was the most intense intellectual environment I had ever even come near, and I did not think I could do it, and Blair says to me, "Well, it is very good to go be the dumbest person in a really smart place.  It'll make you better."  And I was like, "Ooh, okay."  And that's what I did, and I was...I was the least well-read colleague, I was the person who had the largest kind of learning curve to move up, and she was absolutely right.  Those seven years at the University of Chicago were at least as important, I suspect more than the nine years I spent in college and grad school in terms of forcing me to read everything.  It's where I encountered Cathy Cohen, who, whatever evolution I had had around feminism, there was a hard turn at that moment.  She was like, "Oh, no.  You're going to be a feminist and here's how."  (Laughter).  I learned so much from her!  It's where I met Michael Dawson, who is really the best mentor that any junior faculty member could ever have, I'd like to say particularly for women.  Senior men tend to treat us like either their daughter or their date, and Michael Dawson is one of the very few who just treats you like his peer, and it is very empowering and it's a very important part of kind of feeling like you really are a faculty member and not kind of an add-on colleague, so those were incredible years, largely because Blair was like, "Oh, go do that... (unclear) be braver."
Speaker 1: And, you went there in '99 [1999] correct?
Speaker 2: Yeah, umm-hmm.
Story_ID: 564911
Speaker 1: And that was the same year [1999] that you got married [to Dennis Lacewell]?
Speaker 2: Yes, so (laughter) all within about a week.  I finished the Ph.D. [at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina], got married on June 5, we moved; in fact, and I was so poor--poor is the wrong word--so broke in grad school that my appointment began July 1, 1999, but you don't get paid until the end of the month and I am calling my brand new employer and saying, you know, because I just had a wedding June 5, and so we are ten different kinds of broke and I'm calling my brand new employer and asking for an advance on my salary so that I can move, because I don't even have money to--like--move, to pay for the gas, to drive the car.  Not a position I am in now, but you know at twenty-five, that is very much where we were, so all of that happened, all at the same time.
Speaker 1: And so, you, you described your maturation, I guess, at University of Chicago.  You were hired in what role?
Speaker 2: So, I was Assistant Professor, Political Science, very traditional, you know, academic, first job, Michael Dawson had seen me at a political science conference.  I, you know, went there to write books and teach classes, but was given the opportunity to do much more than that.  University of Chicago, unlike a lot of the other, we're kind of Ivy plus, so it's kind of the Ivy Leagues, University of Chicago, Stanford [University in Stanford, California], right?  And most of the other Ivies really have a very strong hierarchy and junior people are not allowed to vote in the same meetings that tenure people voted, and they are not, but that's not Chicago.  Chicago is extremely flat.  No one cares what your title is--hell, no one cares if you've won a Nobel Prize.  I mean, you could have won a Nobel Prize last week, really no one cares.  The question is, in the context of this discussion, how good are your ideas and it is therefore very democratic with a "little d" and very hard to be there, but it meant that as a junior person, I could come in and influence the shape of the department, the future direction of the University.  I was given the opportunity to teach high school courses.  My dean actually supported me doing a program in the local high school at Kenwood Academy [High School] in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], all which became a very famous place later (laughter) but at the time was just my neighborhood.  I had, had the chance to, oh, I'll never forget this.  Michael Dawson was supposed to introduce [HM] Lani Guinier, who was the Martin Luther King Day speaker, maybe it was 2000 or--I can't remember precisely when it was--but it was very early in my time there.  I was a very junior faculty member and she was supposed to do it and, for some reason, was sick maybe.  She was like, "Oh, ask Melissa to do it."  Right?  Not ask another senior person.  "Oh, Melissa will go do it."  Here I was, this junior faculty member who got to meet Lani Guinier, and introduce her, and those were the kinds of opportunities that actually ended up building all kinds of opportunities for me to really be central to the study of African American history and politics and life, because I wasn't just shunted to the side as a junior person.
Story_ID: 564912
Speaker 1: And at this same time, did you also begin to do broadcast?
Speaker 2: No, not yet.  So, 1999, 2000, 2001, I am reading everything I did not read; I mean, boy there was a lot I had not read.  I had not read [Georg Wilhelm Friedrich] Hegel, I had not read [Michel] Foucault, I had not read many the conservative thinkers.  I had not really read [Mahatma] Gandhi and [Frantz] Fanon.  I sort of dabbled in Fanon, but not really, and I had to teach them!  I am not kidding you.  As a political scientist, it doesn't really matter.  Everyone teaches in the Core and so you have to read the Core, so the first two years, I think I worked six, seven days a week, 12 and 14-hour days just in the office reading.  I also had this group of junior colleagues, one of whom is Patchen Markell, whose Facebook posts are more beautifully written than most peoples' books.  (laughter).  Even today.  And they push, push, push me.  So, the first two years, no.  Nothing like broadcast.  I am just working my butt off.  In 2001, I get, yeah, it must be 2001, I am pregnant with my daughter, she is born in January of 2002, and when 09/11 [September 11, 2001] happens I am quite pregnant.  January of 2002, she is born and my book ["Barbershops, Bibles, and BET"] is accepted by a publisher, by Princeton Press, maybe the week before I go into labor, I mean, it was very close.  So, I have the baby and then I start working on all of the revisions for the book.  In the two years from her birth in January 2002, to when the book comes out in the fall of 2004, my first marriage falls apart.  We're [Harris-Perry and Dennis Lacewell] not legally divorced at that point and, in fact, I just remember I was trying to decide what name to put on the book, whether I was going to keep "Lacewell" on the cover.  So, those were really hard, hard years, and that fall of 2004, [HM] State Senator Barack Obama decided to challenge, I guess it was that summer; that summer, State Senator Barack Obama decides to challenge a pretty big Democratic field for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate seat that was open, and I knew Michelle Obama from our work on campus.  I had, when I had first gotten there, I'd watched Barack Obama lose in the second congressional district to [HM] Bobby Rush, so I was kind of watching it, but just sort of, and then all of a sudden out of nowhere, he comes, he wins that primary in the summer and people are trying to explain it (laughter) so I am not kidding you, my, the University of Chicago, Bill Harms, who runs the Media Office, I think he still runs the Media Office, he sends out a press release.  "Hey, Chicago Press!  Interested in somebody who can explain black politics?  We have a professor.  Her name is Melissa Harris-Lacewell.  She has a new book coming out.  You might want to talk to her."  And then, Alan Keyes decides to run against State Senator Obama.  Now we have two African Americans running against each other for the U.S. Senate seat, and I had just published a book about how black people disagree politically.  I mean, I am sitting in Hyde Park.  The guy lives, so, I live here, he lives here.  I'm a runner, he's a runner.  He's a totally different kind of runner.  He was very fast.  I'm very slow.  But, you know, I would often get lapped by him at the point [promontory point] at Hyde Park, like, the guy was living here decides to run for the senate against another black guy when I've just written a book about internal disagreements about black politics.  Bill Harms sends out another press release to the Chicago Press, "Hey, no seriously, we have girl."  I am on every most hilarious morning show that you could imagine.  I mean, I would go on and do, like, my whole analysis of the midterm elections; you know, my whole analysis of, of, of this guy, Barack Obama, and (laughter) and Alan Keyes, and then the next segment would be like a dog in a tutu 'cause it's, you know, WGN morning television.  I did a ton of PBS, and I did a ton of [HM] Rev. Jesse Jackson's The Word Network and so I was really cutting my chops on a lot of, on the one hand, big time stuff and on the other time really not, like, Chicago [Illinois] is a major media market, but I was also on morning TV.  Jesse Jackson is a really big deal, but his show is on the Word Network.  So, what that meant was, I could go.  I could have real exposure, but I could make mistakes.  I wore some very, very tragic jackets at various points on these shows and it didn't mark me as having failed; like, I could go, I could try, I could experiment.  I could figure out what my voice was, and all of it really because of Barack Obama's political rise.
Story_ID: 564913
Speaker 1: So, what are you doing academically as you are building this media profile for yourself?
Speaker 2: Oh, working on the next book.  So, the first book ["Barbershops, Bibles, and BET"] is, you know, out of the dissertation and it's about, you know, black folks disagreeing.  I am writing articles along because, you know, you just, just trying to tenure (laughter).  That's what that goal is.  So, tenure is always, you know, you must get the second book.  So, I mentioned I went through a very painful divorce, my daughter not even two years old when my husband [Dennis Lacewell] left.  The financial circumstances of suddenly becoming a single parent and, so I decided to write a book about black women this time and, at this point, I have really much more clearly solidified my identity as a feminist.  I am working very closely with Cathy Cohen.  She has at that point, taken over leadership of the Race Center [Center for the Study of Race, Politics, and Culture at the University of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois].  I am on the Board of the Race Center at Chicago.  We are pushing the administration to give us a building and postdocs.  I am running that workshop.  I am also running a workshop on race and religion.  I am running another workshop on political psychology.  I am engaging across fields.  I am giving tons of lectures around the country--although not nearly as many as I give now--but it felt like a lot, especially as a single parent at the time, and I am working on this book about black women and the idea of the strong, black woman and the challenges around the notion of the strong black woman, collecting tons of data, I am doing experiments.  I am teaching that high school class with the Kenwood Academy [High School in Chicago, Illinois] kids, and I am very much trying to build a life as a Chicago intellectual, and then I have lunch with one of my white male senior colleagues in the political science department and I tell him about my new book project, which I am really excited about, and he says, "Well, that's not very interesting.  I'm not sure that you'll be able to get tenure with that."  And I thought, okay, okay, I'm okay.  I'm just going to go to Cathy and we'll go to Michael [Dawson] and they're going to tell me that they got me.  It's going to be all right.  So, I go to Cathy and I go to Michael and I was like, "Okay, this is what the senior colleague told me, but you got me right?"  And they were like "Well....I don't know, maybe, it's really hard to just have you.  We are sort of governed by consensus and I think a lot of people are going to think that" and I was like (gasp) Oh my God!  I might not get tenure.  I might not get tenure and I'm divorced and I have a baby, and I am working my butt off and I don't know what to do and I, I freaked out.  So, I did what all people who freak out do.  I went to Princeton [Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey]. (laughter).  And, I spent a semester as a visiting professor at Princeton and built my relationships there.  I was offered tenure in both the politics department there, and I never came up for tenure in Chicago, so I don't know whether I would have gotten tenure in Chicago or not.  I was too freaked out after that.  Found another route, and headed off to New Jersey.
Story_ID: 564914
Speaker 1: As a single parent, is this when your mom [Diana Gray] came to live with you?
Speaker 2: My mom was already there, but she really kicked in as the second parent, basically, at that point; only because she was working and contributing to the household was I able to keep the place that my husband [Dennis Lacewell] and I bought together.  You know, I'm traveling around the country talking while parenting a young child.  That is because my mother was there to do pick-ups after school, so she was, I was an unmarried parent but my mom was right there in the house with me and so, when I went to New Jersey to go to Princeton [University in Princeton, New Jersey], at that point, I think my mom really felt that--she was in her sixties--and I think she felt that the idea of trying to find yet another new job in yet another new city in her sixties was going to be very difficult.  So, at that point, I asked her to retire and to move in with me and so she retired and moved in and really became, as she likes to say, "grammy-nanny," picking up, at that point, my older daughter started kindergarten, whom she picked up every day after school and she really was the facilitating second parent.
Story_ID: 564915
Speaker 1: So, you're at Princeton [University in Princeton, New Jersey].  What is the environment like there?  Who are you working with?  Who are some of the key people?
Speaker 2: It's so different.  If Chicago [University of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois] is a very flat place with very little hierarchy, Princeton is a very hierarchy-based place.  Now, I came with tenure, which meant that I was relatively high on the hierarchy.  I was only the second black woman to ever have tenure in that department.  Carol Swain had tenure in politics previously.  Initially, it started out really beautifully.  I had great colleagues in the Center for African American Studies.  I hoped to be able to do what the Center for African American Studies and be part of it.  I had the Center for the Study of Race, Politics, and Culture in Chicago, which we built collaboratively, and it fell apart pretty quickly.  Let's see, I was seven years in Chicago.  I was only five years at Princeton and by the fourth year, it was very clear that I no longer had the respect of my colleagues in African American studies.  Um, maybe I still had the respect of my colleagues in the politics department.  When I came up for a vote for full professor on the strength of the second book, which is the "Sister Citizen" book, I was voted a full professor offer from the politics department, but I was denied that offer by the African American Studies Center and, you know, I don't know why.  I have theories about why.  Mostly, it is because I think interdisciplinary centers have a very difficult time reaching consensus about particularly quantitative research, so the center at Princeton is mostly, or at least at that time, mostly humanists; you know, philosophers, religion professors, qualitative sociologists, and my book did a lot of regression analysis and experimentation in addition to dabbling in literary criticism in ways that probably irritated the actual professional literary critics at the table.  So, you know, my strongest argument is actually an intellectual one, that they really didn't like the second book; that they saw the second book as too mish-mash and they couldn't see what the contributions of the quantitative work were.  It is also possible that it was not that "high brow."  It might just be that they didn't like me (laughter).  I really don't know, but it, it, it feel apart quickly.  I guess I got there in '06 [2006] and left, I left campus in 2010, even though my appointment lasted until 2011.
Story_ID: 564916
Speaker 1: And, where did you go when you left?
Speaker 2: I went to Tulane [University in New Orleans, Louisiana], so the reason I know I left in 2010, left campus, is because I got married [to James Perry].  So, during that period of time in Princeton, which were pretty lonely years, in fact, actually I guess I went there in 2006.  The very first course that I taught there was a course on Hurricane Katrina, and disaster in American politics because Katrina had happened in August of 2005, and so interestingly enough, I actually met my husband, the man who is now my husband just before I made the move to Princeton, but I certainly did not see him as my future husband.  You know, he was an activist on the ground in New Orleans, and so I was, from the moment I got to Princeton, I was actually commuting back and forth to New Orleans fairly frequently because I was doing research there.  My work was really animated by Katrina and the Katrina disaster and what it taught us about race.  It very much changed the book in that the book ended up being framed around the ways in which black women's bodies and the context of Katrina tell us something about these broader questions I was interested in, and, um, yeah, so I left in, I got married October 3, 2010.  I think I was living full time in New Orleans, and by Thanksgiving, I think the family, we sold the house, moved, brought my mom [Diana Gray], brought my daughter, and started at Tulane, really probably more as a marriage of convenience, which is to say I married a New Orleanian, and I needed an academic job and Tulane was, I felt, the best match institution in New Orleans.  But I didn't go to Tulane for Tulane, and they certainly didn't come looking for me.  It was more I had a set of skills that they needed and I really wanted to live in New Orleans to be near my husband, and so it was a marriage of convenience and I think it ended similarly.  There was never any hard feeling.  There was never anything bad.  It just, we probably weren't a great match and were mostly together because, because it was a time when they needed me and I needed to live there.
Speaker 1: And, so, that lasted from 2010 until when?
Speaker 2: Until 2014, so four years.  So, I have shorter and shorter relationships with the universities--seven years at Chicago [University of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois], five at Princeton [Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey], four at Tulane [University in New Orleans, Louisiana], but hopefully 30 or 40 at Wake Forest [University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina].
Story_ID: 564917
Speaker 1: Now, you also went to Union Theological Seminary [New York City, New York].  When did that occur?
Speaker 2: That was all happening during the Princeton [University in Princeton, New Jersey] years.  Princeton was tough.  It was sad.  I put on thirty pounds, I was very sick.  I had fibroids during all of those years and, at various points was simply bleeding to death.  I, and then, ultimately had a hysterectomy during all of that time.  I, you know, I was a single parent living with my mom [Diana Gray].  My mom was living with me, but, you know, the reality was I was a single parent living in the same household as my mother on a campus where my colleagues didn't like me much, in a town [Princeton, New Jersey] very different than the big, animated diverse city I had been in in Chicago [Illinois], and I needed to get out so I would go to New York once a week and take classes.  I had a lot of religious questions.  I was raised a Unitarian Universalist but I had a very definitive religious experience in about eighth grade in which I became clear that there was a God.  The content of that wasn't so clear, but for me it was an experience that happened in nature and it was just a revelation, a kind of God-is, I-am moment.  And so, I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what the God-is moment means for me.  I think of myself as a Christian Unitarian, raised in a Unitarian tradition, raised as a questioner, raised as a seeker, but also increasingly over the course of all these years, having a set of religious beliefs that lead me to seeing the story and the narrative of Christ as interpreted through black Americans as the best and easiest way for me to describe what my experience of God's love is.  So, I am not a Christian in the sense of thinking, like, I don't particularly think Mary was virgin.  I presume she had sex and that was the story and that was fine.  And, you know, the resurrection, I think is probably more of a theory about how we come back after really terrible awful death-like experiences, and not that like someone actually stood up after dying.  Like, I am not, I just, I am not a Christian Fundamentalist in the sense of needing to believe that Jesus physically walked on the thing that is water, but what I do believe is that the Biblical interpretations of black folk of the experience of Jesus the Christ, who is your friend in the worst times, who loves you when nobody else loves you, who loves you and stands by those who the least of these.  That is what I mean when I say "God," so when I say "Christian," I use that as my interpretive lens because that's what people understand and I don't want to spend forty-five minutes explaining what it is I mean.  So, I think of myself as a Christian Unitarian.  But, through all of that, I still had these fundamental questions about religion and about Jesus and about the Bible, and I really loved seminary because it's a very nice place and people, because people are people of God and are, like, seeking to be ministers are really nice people and I was in a circumstance at Princeton that was not very nice!  And so, I would go to Union every week and sit as a student and take classes and it was very, it was incredibly important during those four years for me.
