Story_ID: 577008
Speaker 1: So next, I'd like to talk about your family as we discussed, and I'd like to start off talking about your mother.  So I'd like to begin by asking you what your mother's name is, and if you could spell that name for me, please.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Lula, L-U-L-A, Anderson, her family maiden name, Montgomery [Lula Anderson Montgomery].
Speaker 1: Where was she born?
Speaker 2: Alberta, Alabama.
Speaker 1: And do you know what year she was born?
Speaker 2: No.  Let's see, around 1810 [sic.] or something like that.  I'm not sure.  Mother was a typical woman; she did not like to discuss her age.
Speaker 1: Did she grow up in Alberta?
Speaker 2: Yes, until she married my father [Dred Montgomery] who brought her to Selma, Alabama.
Speaker 1: And do you know--did she tell any stories about her background or her growing up, like when she was small?
Speaker 2: Mother never spoke about her background, really.  We met and knew her mother [Ellen Anderson] and her father, but beyond my grandparents on mother's side, I know nothing about the family.  I know the brothers, the cousins, and that kind of thing, and we would meet them at family reunions.  But to go into detail about her background, who was before Anderson, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Well, what about your mother?  When she was growing up?  When you spoke with her, did she tell you anything about--any stories about when she was a child?  Or when she was a teenager, just stories before she met your father?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, she would tell us about her growing up in Alberta, Alabama and how strict her mother was on them.  They had to go to church, Welcome A.M.E. Zion Church in Alberta, Alabama, and they had to go there and stay all day and everything, all the social activity, was built around the church.
Speaker 1: Did they attend church every day of the week?
Speaker 2: Not every day in the week, 'cause they, they were farmers, and every day of the week, except Sunday, they were out on that land.
Speaker 1: And did they own the land that they were farming?
Speaker 2: They owned a part of the land, not all of it.
Speaker 1: Were they sharecropping on that land?
Speaker 2: Partly so.
Speaker 1: And I would just like you to repeat the name of your mother's church.  Just--
Speaker 2: Welcome A.M.E. Zion Church, Alberta, Alabama.
Speaker 1: How would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: Mother was very strict, very loving, very kind, and a wonderful mother.
Speaker 1: Do you know what they were--what type of farming they were doing in Alberta?  What were they growing?
Speaker 2: Cotton, and the regular string beans and vegetables, but the main money making object was cotton.
Speaker 1: And do you know what your mother's duties were when she was on the farm?
Speaker 2: On the farm, she was possibly cotton picking.  That was the big thing, cotton picking.
Speaker 1: How many brothers and sisters did she have?
Speaker 2: It was eleven of them.  I don't know.  I don't recall the number of brothers.  As I think back, possibly four brothers, or five brothers, and the rest sisters.
Speaker 1: And did they attend school, or were they really on the farm--
Speaker 2: On the farm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) such that they were unable to do that?
Speaker 2: On the farm.  They went four, fifth grade, the average one of them, went four, fifth grade.  But they knew the value of education.  They had a Ph.D. in wisdom (laughter).
Story_ID: 577009
Speaker 1: Now, what about your father?  If you could start out by telling me your father's name and spelling it for me.
Speaker 2: Dred, D-R-E-D, as in Dred Scott, Montgomery [Dred Montgomery].  He was born in Mount Vernon, Alabama, part Indian [Native American], part Afro-American.  And he had that character of the very strict Indian in his relations with us.  He was reddish complexion and had, so called, straight hair (laughter).
Speaker 1: And you said he was strict in--
Speaker 2: Oh, he was strict (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) the Indian tradition?  What was that like?
Speaker 2: The Indian and the Afro-American tradition.  And that was, there will be no dancing in this house.  There will be no card playing in this house.  And we had to abide by those two rules, especially.
Speaker 1: Did you know your father's parents?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My father's parents was--and I got this by family oral history.  Aunt Hattie [Hattie Montgomery (ph.)] used to come and tell that story about his family.  His grandfather was Joe Montgomery, J-O-E, Montgomery.  He's the outstanding person on his side of the family in that he escaped the South, and went north and joined the Union Army.
Speaker 1: Did he escape from Alabama?
Speaker 2: Alabama, and went north.  He didn't go far north; he went to Mississippi (laughter).  That's northwest, kind of, but that's farther north than Alabama.  That's where he met and joined the Union Army.
Speaker 1: And what war was that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was Civil War, and he had a rifle in the Civil War.  And he was given the job of a guard around a house, a warehouse, that contained guns and gunpowder and that kind of thing.  And his orders was to shoot and kill any person that came near that barn, or that warehouse smoking cigarettes, cigars, tobacco, anything, to shoot and kill.  And one day, who showed up at this warehouse?  General Grant [Ulysses S. Grant], smoking a cigar.  And this is the story as told to us.  General Grant in Mississippi, smoking the cigar, came up to my great-grandfather Joe.  And my grandfather said, "Put the cigarette out."  He paid him no attention.  After the second time, he said, "Put the cigare- cigar out."  But it was a big cigar.  General Grant paid him no attention.  He told him, "I'm telling you for the third time, and I'm raising my rifle to shoot.  Put the cigar out."  General Grant put the cigar out and congratulated him for being a good soldier.  Now, that's the story that Aunt Hattie would tell us around the fireplace in Alabama.  Her great, her father and how brave he was.  And, of course, that was something to remember and rejoice over.  We had a father, a grandfather, a great-grandfather, who challenged General Grant.  My father obtained that rifle and held that rifle in Selma, Alabama to the 1960s.  I'm against guns.  I don't own a gun.  I don't care for guns.  I'm nonviolent as much as I can.  I went home to get that gun, because I knew it was a museum piece.  I got there, my father had sold that rifle for ten dollars to a white man that he didn't know.  "Pop, you have sold a museum piece."  "I didn't know."
Speaker 1: How long before you came to get the gun had he sold it?
Speaker 2: A few months, just a few months, a few months.  I'll never forget that because that was the only gun in history that I admired (laughter), and it left the family.
Story_ID: 577010
Speaker 1: Did you, do you know Joe [Montgomery's paternal great-grandfather, Joe Montgomery]?  Did you meet, or did you hear any stories--you wouldn't have met--did you hear any stories about Joe's wife?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  Unfortunate, women have had a minor role.  They did a major role in our history, but they got no credit for it.  It was the man, the he, him, et cetera.  So she was in that bracket that we didn't hear much about.
Speaker 1: And when your--when Joe was not in the military, what did he do, was he a farmer?
Speaker 2: He was a farmer, yes.
Speaker 1: Was he located to Mississippi?
Speaker 2: No, he was located in Alabama.
Speaker 1: So he returned back (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He came back to Alabama.  Yes, he came back to Alabama and was a farmer.
Speaker 1: And do you know what he raised on his farm?
Speaker 2: No, I don't know.  But Alabama is a cotton picking state, and the chances are high he raised cotton.
Speaker 1: And do you know what the racial atmosphere of the military was when Joe was a member of the Union Army (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What the racial--no, I don't know the percentage of black that was involved.  But from Aunt Hattie's story, many black escaped slavery and went north and joined the Union Army.
Speaker 1: Aunt Hattie [Hattie Montgomery (ph.)], she is the sister of your father [Dred Montgomery]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How many brothers and sisters did your father have?
Speaker 2: My father had one brother whose name is Dabney [Dabney Montgomery].  That's how I got my name, Dabney [HistoryMaker Dabney N. Montgomery].  And there was his sister named Hattie.  There might have been others that I don't know of.  But I knew Aunt Hattie who used to tell us stories, with her white hair combed back to the back of her head in a ball back there, and her eyelashes flashing like this.  No TV, but she was the best TV actress of her time (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you have any other Aunt Hattie stories to share about--
Speaker 2: That was, I remem- oh yes.  She used to tell us a story about the headless horseman.  We would listen to her story about the headless horseman riding on the horse, and this fellow did not have a head, and what he did in that community.  And we would be so afraid until we wouldn't want to go to bed at night, because that headless man might come in on his horse.
Story_ID: 577011
Speaker 1: Now, I want to take you back, because I did--I failed to ask you about your mother's parents.  We talked a little bit about your mom [Lula Anderson Montgomery] and you mentioned that you knew her parents, but I didn't ask you any questions about them.  Can you tell us their names and anything that you know about your mother's parents (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  My grandmother on my mother's side was named Ellen Anderson.  What I remember about her more than any other thing, she spent a good deal of time with us when she became old, in her seventies, and she smoked a cob pipe.  And in those days, she died, possibly in the high '20s [1920s].  In those days, Grandmamma Ellen had all of her teeth.  There was some type of tree that she could walk by and pull something down, a branch down from that tree, and she picked her teeth all the time and got all of that dead matter, bread, et cetera, out from the teeth.  And she smoked that pipe.  And as I said, a minute ago, had all of her teeth, and she was a quiet woman, very quiet, but very firm.  And she lived with us a good while before she died in Selma [Alabama].  Now, my grandfather--
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't recall his name (laughter).  I'm getting eighty-four, eighty-five, and things are beginning to slip now.  But my grandfather said that when he was a little boy, he'd wait in the field in Selma, Alabama, the space that became Selma, Alabama.  And that during lunch hour, he would rest under an oak tree and eat his lunch.  Believe it or not, years after, my father [Dred Montgomery] built a house right under that oak tree and didn't know it.  But my grandfather said, "This is the tree that I used to sit under and eat my lunch when I was a little boy."  And never knew that his daughter would one day live in that, or on that patch of land.
Story_ID: 577012
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your parents [Lula Anderson Montgomery and Dred Montgomery].  How did they meet?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know how they met.  I don't know how they met.  They never talked about that, that I recall.  But I think, I think my mother was in my father's first wedding.  I think she was a bridesmaid or something like that in his first wedding.  See, my father was married four times and he outlived three wives.  He buried three wives, and we know that when the last day comes and everybody starts coming up, he gonna have a problem trying to find out which wife am I gonna spend the rest of my time with (laughter). But he is buried with two of those wives now, and that third wife is about twenty blocks away in east Selma [Alabama].  And that first wife [Minnie Montgomery] is buried down in Alberta [Alabama].
Speaker 1: Is your mother your father's second wife?
Speaker 2: Second wife, yes.  Second wife.
Story_ID: 577013
Speaker 1: And do you have siblings from your father's [Dred Montgomery] other marriages?
Speaker 2: One, he had one son, Joe [Joe Montgomery], from his first marriage.  Joe eventually migrated to New York City [New York, New York], and this is where he died.  Not too many years, about twenty-five years or thirty years ago.
Speaker 1: And how--
Speaker 2: He was a fighter (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What, a boxer?
Speaker 2: A boxer, yes.  Never won a prize, but he was a boxer.  As a ten year old, twelve years old, I used to train with him.  And we used to get up, Joe and I, and run three to six miles every morning.  We called it running in those days.  Now, they call it jogging, but it was running down Range Road [sic. Range Street] three miles one way, and three miles back every morning, and because of that, I developed, although my legs are skinny, they are very strong from that early running in the morning.
Speaker 1: How old were you when you were running with your uncle [sic.]?
Speaker 2: How old was I?  At that time, ten, twelve years old.
Speaker 1: And you said your uncle--
Speaker 2: Whenever my brother, Joe, my oldest--that was the brother, the first child of my father, back with the first wife [Minnie Montgomery] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, I'm calling him your uncle.  Excellent.  So your brother you were running with, and you said he was a fighter.  Did he fight in Alabama and in New York?
Speaker 2: No, in Alabama.  We had constructed a ring made out of whatever, and on weekends they used to stage fights there.  And men from the community would come and fight in that ring.  I'm trying to think of the man who owned that ring.  Oh, it was five blocks from the house, but Joe fought in that ring in Selma [Alabama] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And were these all black fighters?
Speaker 2: They were all black fighters, and I would work in his corner.  And he would do very well until someone would hit him in the nose, and his nose started to bleed.  The moment he saw blood (laughter), yes, down.  Yes, yes.  That was Joe, who left before any of us and came to New York.
Story_ID: 577014
Speaker 1: Now my father was something else.  My father, Dred [Dred Montgomery], worked on the railroad, Southern railroad [Southern Railway], for forty years, and never had a vacation.  It took (laughter)--that's what he told us.  I never knew him to have a vacation.  He said that he was off two weeks during those forty years.  He worked himself up from a track man to a fireman on the engine.
Speaker 2: How did he get a job with the railroad in the first place?
Speaker 1: How did he get a--he was the type of young man that hustled.  He worked.  I mean, he was there trying to make it, whatever.
Speaker 2: And about what year do you think he started working at the Southern railroad?
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.
Speaker 2: Just an approximate.  You don't, you know.
Speaker 1: Let's see.  Forty, forty years (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You said it was forty years.
Speaker 1: He retired about in the '60s [1960s].  He started with the Southern railroad, I guess, about 1810 or something like that.  Not 1810, but 1890, in the early part of the century.  That's a guess on my part.
Speaker 2: And what was it, what was your father's work environment like?  In general, I want to ask you about Alabama, and what the race relations were like there.  What was it like for your father being a working man in Alabama?  Was he working with all black people?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: How exactly did that work?
Speaker 1: An engine has two person in the front, the engineer and the fireman.  You see, that was the day before the electric engine and before the oil engine.  It was the day of the coal.  In order for that engine to move, you had to have a second man in that position to take coal from the second coach there, and throw it into the fire box, to keep a hot fire going, to create steam that would pull that engine and all of the cars behind it.  And that was my father's job, the engine, the fireman to the engine.
Speaker 2: So he didn't put fires out?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: What he did was build fires (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He started, he started the fires.  That's right.  He kept the fire going.  And, of course, there was places in those days, they called refill, they would stop the train, big tank on the side of the rail road and refill with water.  And they would also refill with coal.  But usually, they would have enough coal to go from Selma [Alabama] to Mobile [Alabama].  That's what he--where he was really running, from Selma to Mobile, except during the time of my first sister's birth.  He ran out of Rome, Georgia, and that's where Fairrow Belle [Fairrow Belle Montgomery Prewitt] was born.  But his job was to take this shovel from here to there and keep that fire going.  Now, his left side of the face, I believe, that faced that fire--see, anytime he put coal in that fire, he had to open the door with his foot, get the coal out of here and throw it in there and then close the door.  And then he'd get another shovel, and open that door, and throw it in and close the door with his foot, et cetera.  And the left side was slightly burned because exposure to that heat coming out of that box.
Story_ID: 577015
Speaker 1: We were talking about your father [Dred Montgomery], who was a fireman for the Southern railroad [Southern Railway].  Did he work with other blacks on that job, and were there other black fireman in the North and in the South?
Speaker 2: No.  In the North, you see, I never went north until 1933.  But my friend would come from the North, and relative, and say that there was no black firemens in the North.  They never saw black firemen in the North, but they saw black firemens in the South, and they admired that about the South.  That you can get a better job than many of us who go no higher than the Pullman porter, and you can get a job as a fireman down here.
Speaker 1: So the engineer who your father would ride from Selma [Alabama], what was it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) To Mobile [Alabama].
Speaker 1: --to Mobile.  Was that a black engineer?
Speaker 2: No.  The engineers were white, white.
Speaker 1: But the fireman position was a respected position?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It was higher than a Pullman porter?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  He made more money.  You see, a Pullman porter was a high class waiter, but a fireman was a gun shooting, hard working man.  And there was a certain amount of respect that went with a hard working man, who was making that heavy engine move and pulling all those cars in back of him.  That was a certain amount of inspiration and admiration.
Speaker 1: And you said that your father worked his way up from a trackman--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to the fireman.  What other positions did he hold between working on the track and working as a fireman?
Speaker 2: That I don't know, but he started out as a trackman.  But I don't know what position that he held between a trackman and the fireman position.
Speaker 1: And did he experience any discrimination on the job?  It sounds like he was able to get a great job that was respected in the North, where it couldn't be had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --but what was the working environment like for him in Alabama?
Speaker 2: It was, it was good.  He had to stay in his place as a black man.  My father was part of A. Philip Randolph, Pullman car, Pullman car union [Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters], the first black union in America.  He was part of that.  But this is how he was respected.  He was, let us say, a steward, in Selma, Alabama, with the black union members.  They decided to have a strike, and I'll never forget that.
Speaker 1: A what?
Speaker 2: A strike.  Pullman porters union decided to call a strike (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Strike, okay.
Speaker 2: And they sent my father a telegram saying that the strike was on or off.  I don't know what the telegram said.
Speaker 1: About what year was this (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Western Union [Western Union Company]--oh, I was a little boy, ten years old, twelve years old.  Somewhere in that bracket, teenager.  Well, Western Union did not deliver that message to my father.  They took the telegram and gave it to his boss, who was a white man, of course.  And my father was called in.  "They got a--you got a telegram here from the Pullman colored, Pullman porter union, about a strike.  What, what, what are you planning to do?"  And it was addressed to my father at his house, and instead of Western Union delivering that telegram to his home address, they delivered it to the Southern railroad, his boss.  That's how much he was respected by the system.
Speaker 1: Did your father know A. Philip Randolph personally?  Did he work with him (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  He know, I have a picture of my father and A. Philip Randolph standing together in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: About when was that, when they were together in D.C.?
Speaker 2: Again--in the '30s [1930s].
Speaker 1: I'm asking a lot of dates--
Speaker 2: It's amazing, it's amazing--my sister used to write letters for my father to A. Philip Randolph.  And at that time, A. Philip Randolph lived at 239 West 136th Street, New York City [New York, New York].  My wife [Amelia Neely Montgomery] and I bought a home, and what is the address?  245 West 136th Street, only four doors from A. Philip Randolph's house.
Speaker 1: That's the oak tree theory.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Story_ID: 577016
Speaker 1: Now, how many brothers and sisters did you have, and can you name them, please?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I--we talked about Joe [Joe Montgomery], who was--
Speaker 1: Your oldest brother (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) the first son by my father's first wife [Minnie Montgomery].  The oldest son in our clan, there was five of us.  The oldest son was named Mitchel [Mitchel Montgomery].  Mitchel was an aggressive young man who protected his younger sisters and brothers.  I shall never forget, my sister was sitting down in school [Alabama Lutheran Academy; Concordia College Alabama, Selma, Alabama], and a fellow came up and pulled her chair from under her, and she fell on the floor.  Mitchel went and attacked the boy when he heard about this.  He went and attacked the boy.  So they took Mitchel to the principal's office, and they expelled Mitchel for attacking the boy in school.  My father [Dred Montgomery] came home, they told him the story.  He took Mitchel back to the principal's office and said, "If he hadn't attacked that boy, I would have attacked him.  He did what was right.  I'm bringing him back to this school and he's here to stay."  And he was there to stay (laughter).  They accepted him back.
Story_ID: 577017
Speaker 1: I want to ask about the schools that you attended, but I want to finish the list of your brothers and sisters.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So we have Joe [Joe Montgomery], Mitchel [Mitchel Montgomery]--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --and who else?
Speaker 2: Fairrow Belle [Fairrow Belle Montgomery Prewitt].  Fairrow Belle is the oldest sister.  She's still alive.  Fairrow Belle wanted to be a teacher, and that's what she eventually became, a teacher down in Atmore, Alabama.  That was her first job.  I think she was making twenty-four dollars a month as a teacher.  Now she went to Alabama State [State Teachers College; Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama], and she finished junior college there, and got this job teaching for around twenty dollars to fifty dollars a month, something in that low range, not over fifty dollars, and that was her first job.  And she met a fellow down there and they got married.  It's amazing, when Fairrow Belle was a militant civil rights person, and when they had the civil rights marches in Selma [Alabama], under King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], Fairrow Belle took a sick day off from her job as teacher and came, and witnessed that march, and marched with us for two or three miles, because she was, she was on sick leave.  They wanted to take her picture, and she said no.  She would get fired the next day if they had of caught her marching in that civil rights march, they would have fired her right out.  And I was there also, and she met and made friends with the only white woman that was killed in that march.  Lucy Ozzo [sic.], I believe was her name, Lucy Ozzo?
Speaker 1: Lucy Ozzo?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think that was it.
Speaker 1: (AMELIA NEELY MONTGOMERY):  Liuzzo [Viola Liuzzo].
Speaker 2: Liuzzo was the only white woman--
Speaker 1: Yes.  She was from Illinois, or somewhere in the Midwest.
Speaker 2: So Lu- one more time, please, Ms. Montgomery?
Speaker 1: (AMELIA NEELY MONTGOMERY):  Liuzzo.
Speaker 2: Liuzzo?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Liuzzo is the only white woman--
Speaker 1: (AMELIA NEELY MONTGOMERY):  L-U-I-Z-Z-O [sic.].
Speaker 2: L-I-U-Z-Z-O is the only white woman to die in the march--
Speaker 1: In that march.
Speaker 2: --from--
Speaker 1: From Selma to Montgomery [Alabama].  And my sister and she became very good friends, and I took a picture of the two of them standing together in front of Brown Chapel Church [Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church, Selma, Alabama], and wow, what a picture.  And then, before I left, we heard the news that she was killed, but I didn't know this was the person.  And Fairrow Belle wrote me and told me that the picture you made of me and this white woman was the woman that got killed.  And she sent me the picture.  So I took the picture to Time magazine, Ebony magazine, all of the newspapers had pictures of this woman as a teenager.  They couldn't find a picture of her as an adult.  And I had a picture of this woman standing with my sister in the march behind--in from of Brown Chapel Church, which was the capital of the organization of King movement.  And I took it to Time magazine, and they looked at it, "I'll give you three hundred dollars for the picture." I said, "Give me the picture.  You cannot leave this room, 'cause you might make another one back in that other room.  Give me my picture, I just want to know the value of it."  And I walked out.  I couldn't sell the picture because, again, they would fire her from her teaching job.

Speaker 1: But the amazing thing is, when the civil rights began to settle, and they started with integration down in Alabama, she taught the granddaughter of George Wallace, the governor of Alabama (laughter).  She was in her class.
Speaker 2: What was that woman's name, or little girl at the time?  George Wallace's daughter?
Speaker 1: What, the governor of the State of Alabama?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The one who stood in the door and kept the black out of the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama]?  And, of course, when we marched on Montgomery [Alabama], in that march [Selma to Montgomery March]--now this is what I hear.  This is hearsay.  That Wallace looked out of the window, and he said, "That's a lot of votes down there," (laughter) and changed his position.  Blacks in the University of Alabama, and a black young woman, they tell me, was elected as the homecoming queen of the University of Alabama, and George Wallace kissed her.  This is what was told to me, I didn't see this.  But I thought it was funny, very funny.  How, when you organize with force, on one accord, how you can change things and people.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: That's my sister Fairrow Belle [Fairrow Belle Montgomery Prewitt].  She has three daughters.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Who's your next sibling?  We've got Joe [Joe Montgomery], Mitchel [Mitchel Montgomery], Fairrow Belle--
Speaker 1: And Fairrow Belle, um-hm.  Fairrow Belle has--let me tell you something about--Fairrow Belle had three children, three daughters.  And we are very proud of the three daughters, because one is the scholar of the family.  Elaine is her oldest daughter, she is now research professor in the medical school at Arkansas University in Little Rock [Fay W. Boozman College of Public Health, Little Rock, Arkansas].  That's a white university.  She's research professor there.  Always read books, Elaine; everybody else playing, Elaine reading a book.  And she worked herself up to the Ph.D., and she had written for magazine, and she is an authority on food and diet.

Speaker 1: Who's your next sibling after Lulabelle--after Fairrow Belle [Fairrow Belle Montgomery Prewitt]?
Speaker 2: After Fairrow Belle?  Clyde [Clyde Montgomery].  Clyde also went to Alabama State [State Teachers College; Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama], and he met a young lady, Ceola [Ceola Hamlin Montgomery] there, and they got married and had three sons.  Clyde served in World War II [WWII] also, and he came out and went in the post office.  And he was a postal clerk on a railroad train from, for a while, from Birmingham to wherever.  Nashville [Tennessee] or wherever, then he came back and headed the postal work in Birmingham, Alabama, as a representative of the postal person- personnel in the post office.

Speaker 1: What's your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: A red suit.
Speaker 1: Tell us about it.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't know.  I had a red cap, a red suit, and everything was red.  I don't remember any further back than that red suit.
Speaker 1: You said that, you expressed that your parents [Lula Anderson Montgomery and Dred Montgomery] were very strict--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and that in particular, there was no dancing, and no card playing in your house?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Why those two rules in particular, and were there any other rules that you might tell us about?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, in those days, the religious people did not play cards.  They did not dare, for some reason.  And Fairrow Belle [Fairrow Belle Montgomery Prewitt] became an expert card player, by the way (laughter).  She was in a club that played--what do you play in cards, bid whist, or whatever (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Bridge?
Speaker 2: Bridge.  Bridge was her game.  And she was one of the hierarchies in the bridge club, and they travelled.  And papa, I know, sitting up in heaven, better say, "What my daughter doing down there playing cards?"  (Laughter) Your other question, you questioned something else about, why did they--
Speaker 1: I was just asking generally about your fam- just about to get into your family life.  So I was just starting with your parents' strictness, and you were saying that religious people, you know, didn't do particular things.  So can you just describe what family life was like?  What family life was like when you were growing up with your brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Family life was going to school, obeying the mother and father, and adults and going to church [Clinton Chapel A.M.E. Zion Church, Selma, Alabama] on Sunday.  Everything centered around these three things: going to work, going to school, and going to church on Sunday.  My father was a deacon in the Baptist church.  We--my mother was a Methodist, A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] Zion.  And for some reason, we never joined my father's church.  All of us kids joined my mother's church.  In fact, I joined my mother's church without her permission at six years old.  The minister, after preaching that Sunday, opened the doors of the church, and said, "If there is anyone who feels the spirit, come and give me your hand and God your heart."  And I crawled over my mother's lap and went down the, the--
Speaker 1: Aisle?
Speaker 2: --aisle, and gave the preacher my hand and my mother came behind me.  "That boy doesn't know what he's doing, he's too young."  But the mother of the church, Mrs. Armstrong [ph.], came after my mother and said, "I feel something.  Leave that boy there."  And my mother left me at the altar and stood there with me while they accepted me into the church at six years old.
Speaker 1: And what about your brothers and sisters?  Did they similarly join, or did--were they instructed to join (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  They were instructed to join.  Yes, yes, yes.

Speaker 1: Now with your father [Dred Montgomery] travelling on the railroad, was he gone for part of the week?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, he was gone, let us say, one or two nights at the time.  And believe it or not, I was fourteen years old when my mother [Lula Anderson Montgomery] died.  But when my father was away, I insisted on sleeping with my mother, and we were very close until the day she died.  I was a very poor eater.  They had to force me to eat, and on her dying bed, she said, "See to it that the baby eats his dinner."  And ever since that day, I have been eating like I don't know what (laughter).  I never gained weight until I became seventy-five.
Speaker 1: So during the week, you spent time with your mother after school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: And what kind of things did you--
Speaker 2: Well, we was just home (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, what was your mother like at home?
Speaker 2: Mother and I just talked about life and what I was supposed to do, and the same things, and in certain atmospheres, fifth grade student.  But she had wisdom, and when I look at these fourteen year old girls now with a baby in their arms, and that's their baby, and they're giving that baby, let us say, orange soda for orange juice, there is no wisdom there.  And this is one of our problems.  So many of our children have family structure, that there is not wisdom, and baby is having a baby.  I don't want to get off on that but (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 577022
Speaker 1: Tell us about holidays in your home.  Were there specific holidays that were most important, and how did you spend them?
Speaker 2: Christmas, of course, was the holiday.  We believed in Santa Claus for a long time.  And I realized that, when I found out who he was, I had better not tell it because he might get cut off.  So when I found out who Santa Claus was, I told nobody.  I just let him put the toys under the bed on Christmas Eve, and I got up and enjoyed them.  And eventually I told them what, and that I knew who Santa Claus was.  But Christmas was a family day.  They would start cooking cakes weeks before Christmas, weeks (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What kind of cakes?
Speaker 2: Name it, but mostly that cake with all those nuts and--fruit cake.  Now my mother [Lula Anderson Montgomery] could cook a fruit--she could cook anything, but she could--and not measure anything, just put it together and it would come out.  We would cut up nuts and everything, and she would mix them up, and when that cake was ready to be cooked, she would put it in the stove, and when it was done, she'd put little, straw and stuff over it and she'd let it sit and that cake would stay there for weeks and weeks and weeks, and it was still fresh.  We had a pecan tree in the back yard, and that we'd go out and take a stick and throw it up in the tree and the pecans would just fall all free.  And we would take these nuts and cut them up, and mom would make all kinds of things out of them.  And that was one of the things she did.  Preserves--that was another thing.  These ring glass jars with an air tight top on it, you know?  You can push it down and something would click and you'd take a little contraption made of wire and pull it down.  Mom had a whole box of those things.  And she would preserve everything: watermelon rind, peaches, anything we ate, string bean.  She would preserve all that stuff for us to eat.  And that was a part of our bringing up.
Speaker 1: Now, at Christmas, did other relatives come over to the house?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  It was a joyous time.  We just mixed and had fun together, and look what I got for Christmas, you know.  That was a big thing.  "Look what I got for Christmas."
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of your Christmas gifts as a child?
Speaker 2: Mostly, clothing.  Mostly clothing, and I remember a red wagon I received at Christmastime, because it was red, and it was a wagon you pull and the two wheels go right and left.  That was a joyous thing, shining bright and new.  And that was indeed a great--and then a bicycle, my first bicycle.  Oh, balloon tires, they had, and they had a little pocket here, where then you can open that pocket, between the--your seat and the handle bars, and you could put items in there.  And this was an exceptional bicycle, and oh, it was like a, a Cadillac.  I had some fun (laughter) on that bicycle.  That was my baby (laughter).

Speaker 1: What street did you live on?
Speaker 2: In Selma [Alabama]?
Speaker 1: When you were growing up in Selma?
Speaker 2: Green, G-R-E-E-N Street.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And 1st Avenue.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about your house, and about your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What kind of neighborhood did you live in?
Speaker 2: Well, we lived on the corner of Green and 1st Avenue, and we had a telephone.  The telephone was on the wall, and we had to have a telephone because my father's job required him to have a telephone.  As a railroad man, you would get a call, maybe two and a half, three hours before you were to report to that engine.  "Dred [Dred Montgomery], it's time to get up, to get on the road down here."  And we would get that call, about two, three hours before he left the house on that train, so he had to have a telephone call.  And that telephone was on the wall, and the number was four number 9532, something like that.  And you'd just pick up the telephone, "9532."  And the operator would say, "All right.  We'll connect you with 9532," or whatever, and you'd be connected.  And that was a party line, maybe two people or three people was on that line.  And often, we'd pick up the telephone to make a call, and that person on the other line was talking to somebody else.  And sometimes we might get a little impatient and say, "Get off that line, I want to make a telephone call," (laughter).  But these things happened, and it was all part of living.
Speaker 1: So telephones were rare for people in your neighborhood (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.  Of course they were rare.
Speaker 1: Anybody else have a telephone?
Speaker 2: Possibly, I'm trying to think of somebody--we were the first in that block that had a telephone and a bathtub.  You know the bathroom, in those days, was outside.  You walk off the back porch about fifty feet and there was the outdoor room that you did your private business.  And inside, there was a tub, big tin tub that we all took baths on Saturday nights.  And my father decided to get a bathroom, and the toilet was running, the bathtub was here, and the face bowl here, and people came to see the bathroom (laughter).  The, the, the tub that you take the bath in, one of our neighbors looked at it and said, "I would never buy one of those things."  And we said, "Why?"  "Too many people get killed in them," (laughter).
Story_ID: 577024
Speaker 1: Can you describe your house to us?  Was it a big house?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was a big house.  You know, I tell a joke.  I say, my father [Dred Montgomery] was rich and he owned three houses.  The house we lived in, the chicken house, and the outhouse (laughter).  The house we lived in was a three bedroom house, room for the boys, room for the girls, my father and my mother's [Lula Anderson Montgomery] room.  Then dining room, a kitchen, and a bathroom.  And an L shaped porch, running from here to here, and it turned and ran around the rest of the house.  Almost half of the house was covered by a front porch, and that front porch was the place for sitting, relaxing, and looking at people go by, and saying hello to people that you didn't know, and just a lovely place.
Speaker 1: Did you live in a black community?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  A black--better live in a black community (laughter).  Black community, yes.  It was an interesting, interesting community, and I appreciate, I appreciate Selma for this.  In Selma, Alabama back in the '20s [1920s], one block from us was the Alabama Lutheran Academy [Concordia College Alabama, Selma, Alabama].  Two and a half blocks from us was Payne University [Daniel Payne College, Selma Alabama], black school [HBCU].  Across town was Selma University [Selma, Alabama], a Baptist school, and a few blocks over was Knox Academy [Selma, Alabama], a Presbyterian school taught by white people from the North.  So ten thousand people in Selma was exposed to all of this education, and that's all we talked about: who's going to college, where are you going to college, and what you gonna be?  And that involvement of the schools around us gave us a positive attitude about ourselves, our self-esteem was, "I can make it too."
Story_ID: 577025
Speaker 1: Was your father [Dred Montgomery] base- I guess, due to his job, was he doing quite well in comparison to, perhaps, your neighbors [in Selma, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My father made two hundred dollars a month, and that was good money in those days.  Two hundred dollars a month meant that we ate every day, and, although, we had to take our socks that was broken in by our big toe, and take that sock, and ball them up and put it under the foot, and sometimes we had to get these half soles on our shoes too often.  And--but we had food on the table and that was very important.  Now, the type of food we ate was a streak of lean, streak of fat.  My pop and mom [Lula Anderson Montgomery] bought lard by fifty pound can, and when we bought streak of lean, streak of fat, it was a slab.  And mom would cut it and it became bacon, and that grease from it could be poured on the grits, and she could take the rest of that grease and make soap from it.  Chicken, we had on Sunday, every Sunday.  That was the prime meal, chicken.  Mom used to make those rolls, hot rolls.  Make 'em on Saturday night, and--as a biscuit--put butter on top, and then fold them over and let them sit all night.  And they would rise to this high (gesture), and they became hot rolls the next morning on Sunday.  Oh, that was a treat.
Speaker 1: Now, your mother was a homemaker?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, she was a homemaker.
Speaker 1: And was that unusual?  Did the other women in the community work?  How was that?
Speaker 2: No.  It wasn't unusual in those days.  In those days, the whole family was productive.  We did something to keep the house going.  And the mother was the manager of the house.  And she might have, in rural areas, gone into the field a portion of the day, and come back and got the meal ready for the night and that kind of thing, and cleaned up and that kind of thing.  And, of course, we would sit around on the porch and talk, to socialize.  You see, black people hanging out now on the streets, on the porch, on the--they're standing on the street.  Go to any neighborhood, black neighborhood, you'll see black people standing out on the street.  It's part of our culture.  It started with slavery.  When, when they had slaves, they, at the end of the day, they stood around the front and exchanged news.  What slave had been bought, and what slave may be sold, and whatever happened in that black community.  And they did it on the front porch, and in the front yard, and it became a news source.  It became a part of our culture.  And it never left our blood because you go to any, any city, you see black people standing around on the street and porch.
Speaker 1: What kind of responsibilities did you and your brothers and sisters have in your household?
Speaker 2: I had the responsibility of keeping the front yard clean, and the backyard clean.  And I had to get out there and sweep, and keep that clean.  My responsibility also was cutting kindling.  You know, we'd get pine wood, and cut it up to small pieces a little larger than about the size of two fingers.  And early every morning, we had to take this kindling that we cut.  First, we would put it in the fireplace, paper in the fireplace, kindling on top of the paper.  Set the paper on fire, and the kindling would be set on fire, and we'd put coal and heavy wood on top of that, and that would be our heat.  That was our responsibility.

Speaker 1: What sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: What sights, smells and sounds?  So today, when you're outside and you see something, or you smell something, or you hear something, which of those types of sensations remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: You know, every now and then, I hear a train going north, and it blows its whistle as it crosses the East River.  And when that train blows that whistle, it reminds me of the whistle that we used to hear.  We used to pick our father [Dred Montgomery] up, and we knew when he was coming in town by the whistle on the engine.  We knew how each engineer blew the whistle, and we could hear a whistle being blown on an engine, and we knew exactly what engineer was on that train.  And when my father's train, my father's engineer would blow the whistle, we'd be sitting on the steps somewhere, "Poppy's coming to town [Selma, Alabama]," we'd go down and pick him up.
Speaker 1: How did you go pick him up?
Speaker 2: We had a car, big time (laughter).  We, we had--let me see.  The first car we had was a car--REO [REO Motor Car Company], a REO.  They stopped making these cars years ago (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What year is this REO?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't know.  This REO had disc wheels, and you had to crank it up, get in front of the car, and crank it until the motor started running.  And then get out in front of it, because it might start off rolling.  But you had to crank that car up, and the windshield wipers, turn the windshield wipers on, no--the windshield wipers on the front of the car, you had to work it with your hands.  When it start raining, you had a little contraption that you went like that (gesture) to keep the windshield clean.  And when you did forty miles per hour, you did, you was doing something (laughter).  And dusty roads, oh gosh.  Those rocks and red clay, when you got to your point, your destination, you need a bath almost, because that dust from the car in front of you would come right back on you.  And the same thing with the trains.  The smoke, that engine smoke--you better not go under a tunnel, because that smoke would just come in the--there was no air condition, forget about that.  The windows was up and the smoke would come in the window, and you'd kind of wipe your face when you got to where you were going.  And, of course, we couldn't eat in the dining car, if there was a dining car.  We had to get on the train with our chicken, and there was a hot rod pipe that ran right down the seat side.  Just like, you'd sit in here, and next to the wall was a hot steam pipe.  And you put that chicken on that hot pipe, warm it up, you smell it all over the coach, and then you'd eat that chicken.  That was good stuff (laughter).
Speaker 1: This was when you took a train trip?
Speaker 2: When, when you took a train trip.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.

Speaker 2: Alabama Lutheran Academy [Concordia College Alabama, Selma, Alabama].  They're still there, and they have developed into a full college.  Amazing as a kid, first to the seventh grade, in a one room situation.
Speaker 1: And did all your brothers and sisters attend?
Speaker 2: All of them attended there, from the first to the seventh grade.  And after the seventh grade, we went to the Baptist school [Selma University, Selma, Alabama] across town.  But at the Alabama Lutheran Academy, we studied the Holy Bible two times a day, and we prayed three times a day.  In that one room school, seven grades in one room.  The first grade here, the second grade there, third grade there, and on and on.  And when it was time for your history, the seventh grade to come up, and recite their history, get up to the front and recite that history.
Speaker 1: Did you have one teacher?
Speaker 2: One teacher.
Speaker 1: Can you--
Speaker 2: And no discipline.  I mean, we had discipline, I mean, she had a belt, a black belt, about that wide (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was your teacher's name?
Speaker 2: Ms. Edwards [ph.].  Ms. Edwards had a belt, and you got out of hand, "Come here boy."  We'd go to her with our hands out like that, and she would take that strap and hit us on our hands and we'd go back.  If we had that situation now, the teachers would all go to jail (laughter).  They would all go to jail.
Speaker 1: What kind of a student, what kind of an elementary school student, were you from first to seventh grade?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was a C student, all the way.  In the fifth, sixth, and seventh grade, I was the only one in my class, and that was quite a job because I had to do everything.  I'd do all of the math, when they said, sixth grade, come to the front, I had to get up and go to the front and do all the math, all the recitations, all of everything, all the reading.  And that's what you call personal attention.
Speaker 1: And what kind of a student were you?  What kind of a child were you?  Were you well mannered or were you getting the belt?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm looking at my own life, I think I was a pretty good kid.  I was a pretty good kid.  I was a pretty good kid.
Speaker 1: And what were your favorite subjects when you were in elementary school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When I was in elementary school, really, I enjoyed religion, I enjoyed religion, studying the Bible.  Books of the Bible, what they mean?  What did Isaiah say?  What did Jesus do and all that.  I enjoyed that.  And believe it or not, when I left the Lutheran school, I went to the Baptist school.  There, we had Bible two times a week.
Speaker 1: Wait, back to your elementary school.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What did you, when you were in elementary, when you were in first to seventh grade, what is, what were your aspirations?  What--you said you talked about going to college, were you already talking about going to college when you were in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, because we were surrounded by colleges, and that's what people did.  They went to college when they left high school in that little town.
Speaker 1: And what did you think that--when you were in elementary school, what did you think that you were going to grow up to be?

See, in the Methodist church you had three, three boards.  One is a class leader board, the board of steward, and the trustee board.  Well I was, at sixteen, I was a class leader with all my members, adult.

Speaker 1: And was that also a junior college?  How was that school arranged (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was a junior college also.  And in those days, I'm talking about 1937, I went to Selma University high school.  Men was coming back, preachers was coming back finishing high school, and that would give them an upward lift in their administrative and overall ability, to finish high school.  And then they would go on two years of college and that would give them another lift.
Speaker 1: So were most ministers at that time not nece- they were not necessarily educated--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --past elementary school?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So they would--
Speaker 2: Many of the ministers--
Speaker 1: And did they study with you in your classes?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, they studied with us; we were all classmates.  When I was in the ninth grade through the twelfth grade, most of my friends were ministers, most of them.
Speaker 1: Anyone in particular?
Speaker 2: Oh, I had several friends, several friends.
Speaker 1: And who was your teacher in high school?  Was it a one room situation again (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no, no, different.
Speaker 1: --or was it a separation of grades?
Speaker 2: There was separation of grades, and classroom and everything.  And we were taught in Selma University by--the president of Selma University was a man by the name of Dr. Dinkins, William Dinkins [William H. Dinkins].  And he had a master's degree from Columbia University [New York, New York], and he was very strict, and he was a first lieutenant in World War I [WWI].  So he was a brilliant man, and he was president of Selma University, and we had other teachers that were outstanding teachers.  Had been to school in the North and other colleges, and was there returning home to teach.
Speaker 1: Now, you said in high school that you got even more religious studies instruction?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Was that still your main interest and your favorite subject (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, bec- it was still my main interest and I enjoyed it.
Story_ID: 577030
Speaker 1: And they gave me more responsibility in Clinton Chapel A.M.E. Zion Church [Selma, Alabama].
Speaker 2: Please tell us about that.
Speaker 1: Clinton Chapel A.M.E. Zion Church was a church on Green Street also that we organized.  It was organized long before I was born, but it was a church that my mother [Lula Anderson Montgomery] was a member of, and that's where I joined the church at six years old in 1929 and stayed there.  And I--well, as I travelled, I still kept my membership there until I finally settled in New York [New York], and I became a member of Mother A.M.E. Zion Church [Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church].  So Selma Clinton Chapel was indeed a spiritual church.  When you had difficulty with the white community, with the social structure, with the political structure, with any problem, you could bring it to church and just get it off.  Get it off.  That's the reason so many sisters shout, and the men stand up, "Reverend, go to it, tell it like it is."  They're getting off the problems that they couldn't solve out in the political world.  My father was in an automobile accident sitting in front of the house, white man ran right into him.  And, of course, he did damage to the car they were sitting in, and they called the police.  Police came out, wrote it up, and they went to court.  The white man came back and told my father, "Don't you appear in court."  So my father went to the chief of police, said, "Mr. So and So told me not to appear in court."  Chief of police said, "That's all right, Dred [Dred Montgomery].  Don't appear.  We'll take care of him."  Where could he protest, but in church?  I mean, "Reverend, tell it like it is.  We're gonna get our gold and slippers one day.  We gonna rise up; we gonna be somebody."  And people, black people, did this rejoicing, and getting things off the chest.  And they rejoiced in the Lord, because the Lord was taking those things off their chest as they shouted.
Speaker 2: So tell us a little bit more about your participation in the church?  Are the silver teas something that you participated in during church (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes, now--
Speaker 2: What is a silver tea?
Speaker 1: Okay, a silver tea is an organization, what shall I say?  It's part of fundraising.  You invite a few people to give solos and read poetry on a Sunday afternoon, and you would invite people to come and listen to the poetry reading, and to the singing, and whatever talent that they had.  Now, this was an event, in many cases.  Ladies would put on their best to go to the silver teas, and they would pay ten cents to get in.  That's the reason they called it the silver tea.  And they would sit down and listen to black people at their best, reading poetry and singing solos, and then they would serve them tea.  And when they would serve them tea, they would stick their little finger out like this (gesture) and elbow up and drink the tea (laughter).  That was real socializing.  That was high society.  When you stuck that little finger out like that and held the tea, yes.  That's socializing.
Speaker 2: Did you perform in silver teas?
Speaker 1: Well, I used to sing solos when I was a kid.  But I wasn't a good singer, but I was there to do my ten cents worth.  But the other sister, really, not many of us could sing, but we were just giving our best.  That was it.
Speaker 2: Did you work with the youth in your church?
Speaker 1: Well, I taught Sunday school.  And on that bicycle that I was talking about a few minutes ago, I used to pick up a little girl and take her to Sunday school every Sunday morning.  And amazing, when I went back home back in the '90s [1990s], that young lady was a grandmother (laughter).  But it was a joy to know that at one time in her life, I picked her up to take her to Sunday school on Sunday.  And she was a nurse, RN nurse [registered nurse].  Yes.
Story_ID: 577031
Speaker 1: When you were in high school [Selma University, Selma, Alabama], what did you--was your plan--your plan was to go to college, you've said that.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Which college did you think that you were gonna go to, and what did you think you were gonna study?
Speaker 2: Well, since I was at A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] Zion, we have a chief educational institution, Livingstone College in Salisbury, North Carolina.  And the minister at Clinton Chapel [Clinton Chapel A.M.E. Zion Church, Selma, Alabama] told me about Livingstone College, and that I should go there, and that the Lord had told him to tell me to prepare myself to be a minister.  And my answer was, "Go back to the Lord and tell him to come to me.  I don't want any secondhand messages about going into the ministry.  Tell me what to do."  And the Lord never got back to me, and told me to go into the ministry.  But, you know, what I did when I went to Livingstone College?  I majored in religion, religious education, because I felt that so many people was telling me to go into religion, that if I got the call from God to go into religion, I would have the background, and that's what I did.
Story_ID: 577032
Speaker 1: So I want to ask you before we leave your school life and go into the [U.S.] Army about race relations in Selma, Alabama when you were growing up.  You talked a little bit about people getting some of it off their chests in church on Sundays.  Can you just speak about what it was like for your parents [Lula Anderson Montgomery and Dred Montgomery] and other adults and citizens who were in Selma?  What was the atmosphere like?
Speaker 2: Well, we had to sit in the back of the buses.  That was a main thing.  We had to take second place in everything.  In some stores, we couldn't try on a hat or shoes.  I shall never forget a terrible experience my brother and I had when we went to pay a bill downtown in Selma for my father.  I'll never forget this.  My brother went in and said, "I came to pay ten dollars on Mr. Dred Montgomery's bill."  The white man said, "Mr. Dred Montgomery.  What do you mean, Mr. Dred Montgomery?  He ain't nothing but Dred, and don't you ever come to me with Mr. on your father."  Called my father up and told him, "Never send my brother down to pay another bill for him," because he referred to my father as Mr.  That's how silly and awful things were in those days.  We had--we couldn't go to the drugstore downtown and buy soda, and ice cream, better not.  We just did without it.  The white kids would go buy, sit down, but we couldn't and it was everything so pronounced that, "You are not as good as I am, your white father."  But in spite of all that, we felt that we were just as good as everybody.  And you can't take that away from me.  You can tell me and put a structure up that make me look inferior, but I will not accept that.
Speaker 1: What made it possible for your--you and others in your community to maintain that attitude in the midst of this very separatist situation?
Speaker 2: Putting it to a God and education.  See, you can't beat those two.  Man can throw up any structure you can dream of, but if you have God in you, and if you have the proper education, you gonna find ways and means to defeat it.
Story_ID: 577033
Speaker 1: When did you graduate from high school [Selma University, Selma, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: I think it was 1941.
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm thinking back now, sixty something years.  Nineteen forty-one [1941], yes, 1941.
Speaker 1: And what did you do after high school?
Speaker 2: After high school, I was waiting.  I was waiting on the [U.S.] Army to draft me, because we were going into World War II [WWII] at that time.  The Tuskegee Airmen was being trained, and they used to come to Selma [Alabama] to socialize with the girls, the 99th air squadron [99th Pursuit Squadron].  And I was waiting to be called by the Army to go into the Army.
Speaker 1: So what did you do with that time while you were waiting to be drafted (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I went to Selma University college, took one year of study at Selma University college, and I was--spent that time of '42 [1942] and part of '43 [1943] at Selma University college.
Speaker 1: And that college is attached to the high school that you went to?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That was all one institution.
Speaker 1: And so during that time there were Tuskegee Airmen visiting--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Selma.  So do you know, in your mind, that when you get drafted, that you're going to join the Tuskegee Airmen (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no I had no idea what they would do with me once I was drafted.  No idea.
Speaker 1: So what happened, how did that work?  You got drafted and, how do you get that information?
Speaker 2: I was drafted and obeyed orders, and was sent to Fort Benning.
Speaker 1: Did they send you a letter?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  They sent me a letter that, to report at the Dallas County Courthouse [Selma, Alabama].  And report at a certain time and I would be given instructions to follow through, and that's what I did.  I reported to the courthouse there in Selma, and they told us to be there at a certain time on a certain date, a bus will be taking us to Fort Benning, Georgia.  And they--I don't know whether they saw us, yeah, I think they saw us in at that board.  Because once I went there, it was only a day or two before I was to report back to go to Fort Benning, Georgia.
Speaker 1: So you go to the courthouse in Selma, and then, not two--a couple days later, this bus picks you up and takes you?
Speaker 2: Yes.  To Fort Benning, Georgia where we went through a physical examination and a mental examination.  And if we passed that, that was the first day there, then they would, we'll be inducted into the [U.S.] Armed Forces.
Story_ID: 577034
Speaker 1: And you were inducted into the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We had no [U.S.] Air Force then.  We had what we called an [U.S.] Army Air Corps, and that later became the Air Force in 1945.
Speaker 1: And once you were inducted into the Army Air Corps, where did you go?
Speaker 2: At Fort Benning [Georgia]?  Well, Fort Benning--we--it was a clearing center, really.  And once we were cleared from Fort Benning, they sent us to Keesler Field [Keesler Air Force Base], Mississippi, Biloxi, Mississippi, where they gave us basic training, but they leaned towards Air Corps, Army Air Corps.  Through all of our training, although it was basic training in Keesler Field, was leaning towards the Air Corps.
Speaker 1: When you say leaning towards Air Corps, do you mean participating in jobs that were related to Air Corps?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That kind of thing, yes.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what any of those responsibilities were?
Speaker 2: Responsibilities were basically getting us into shape, drilling every day on that white sand.  In the summertime, when the temperature went up to, it seemed, 103 [degrees], when a percentage of men fell out on the field, they would draw everybody in, and that's what we went through during the Keesler Field.  But it was really getting us into physical shape, and getting us ready to obey any order.
Speaker 1: How did you end up at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: I never went to Tuskegee.  What happened is, after basic training at Keesler Field, they sent a few of us to specialized clerical training in Camp Lee [Fort Lee], Virginia at Petersburg, Virginia.  And there, we studied the mechanics of clerical work, supply and demand.
Speaker 1: Can you repeat that word? Cler- ?
Speaker 2: The mechanics of clerical work, they taught us at Fort Benning.  No, I'm sorry, at Camp Lee, Virginia.
Speaker 1: You're not saying clerical?
Speaker 2: Clerical.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So you do mechanics, you do clerical work at Fort Benning?
Speaker 2: At Fort Benning, at the specialized school.  And when we finished there, they sent us--when I say us, there were only three of us at this point--to the Tuskegee Airmen, up in northern Michigan.  And that's how I became a part of the Tuskegee Airmen.
Speaker 1: Where in northern Michigan?
Speaker 2: Oscoda [Michigan], up on the Canadian border.
Speaker 1: And you did additional training in Oscoda?
Speaker 2: Well, we had training, and they were packing to go overseas.  When we arrived there, they were packing to go overseas.  We had received the training, now get the job done, and that's what the whole plan was.  So we became a part of the 1051st Quartermaster Group [1051st Quartermaster Service Group Aviation Company].  And the Quartermaster Group was a part of the 96th air service group [96th Maintenance Group] which serviced the 332nd Fighter Group [332nd Expeditionary Operations Group].  And my group was specializing in supplies: food and clothing.  So we clothed and fed the 332nd Fighter Group.
Story_ID: 577035
Speaker 1: Now, you said that when you moved from--I'm missing the name of the second place, before you went to Osco- Oscoda [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Oscoda.
Speaker 1: Oscoda, there were only three of you?
Speaker 2: Right.  There were three of us in Camp Lee, Virginia [Fort Lee, Virginia]--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --in that special clerical training program.  And they sent us from Camp Lee, Virginia to Oscoda.
Speaker 1: And who was with you?  Do you remember the two fellows that went with you?
Speaker 2: I don't.  I don't remember--Holliday [ph.] was one.  I don't remember the other.
Speaker 1: Were they from Alabama?
Speaker 2: No.  They were from Ohio.
Speaker 1: And what happened to the other group of people--
Speaker 2: I don't know what happened (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) to bring you down to three? Perhaps they went other places.
Speaker 2: I don't know what happened.  You know, the [U.S.] Army would put you on a train and you not know, you don't where you're going.  So you had to sit there until somebody say, "Okay.  Get off.  You're now in such and such a place."  That's what happened to us.
Speaker 1: So when you went to Oscoda, do you remember any of the people who were there with you?  It wasn't just the three of you? There were others (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it was a whole company.  We were the last.
Speaker 1: And you all serviced the 332nd [332nd Fighter Group; 332nd Expeditionary Operations Group]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you remember anybody else who was on that crew with you?
Speaker 2: Yes, the captain was Lake [ph.], I believe from Baltimore [Maryland].  He was a school teacher from Baltimore.  And he was the captain of the company.  And we had a lieutenant from St. Louis [Missouri], I've forgotten his name.  We had another lieutenant from some other place, but they were all black.  And this was a pleasure for me, it was a surprise that I was in this all black group with all the officers black.
Speaker 1: Did you say surprised?
Speaker 2: Surprise, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were surprised.
Speaker 2: Because they had two armies then.  They had one with all white, and one with all black.  Now, we were fortunate enough to have black officers in our group.  Wherein, the other black soldiers, like those in the tank battalion that followed General Patton [George S. Patton], they had white officers, had many white officers.  But we had all black officers.
Speaker 1: So did that make a difference in how you were treated in the Army at Oscoda, the fact that your company and your officers were black?
Speaker 2: Well, I couldn't compare my situation with another situation, because I knew only of my situation.
Speaker 1: So can you speak generally about what the racial relationships were like in the Army?  Clearly, you've said that there were two separate armies.  Are the armies treated the same?  Are you getting the same types of equipment and training and support, or are you getting less because you all are black?
Speaker 2: Well, we're getting less.  In essence, we are getting less.  For example, in the white Army Air Corps [U.S. Army Air Corps; U.S. Air Force], when a pilot had served for so long, he could get rotated back to the United States and somebody would take his place.  But when they're black, it wasn't any ever black to be rotated back.  That was one of the big differences.  We were there, and we had to stay there.
Speaker 1: So it was kind of like your father [Dred Montgomery], who never had a vacation in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: --forty years on the railroad [Southern Railway].
Speaker 2: Never had a vacation.  Never had a vacation.  That was one of the big problems with that all black fighter group.  See, the white fighter pilot could be rotated back and they could train other pilots.  They wouldn't let no black man change no white man in those days.  Not in the [U.S.] Armed Forces.  They wouldn't do that.  So you had the two different set of rules and regulations for the black, for the white.
Speaker 1: And you said that the 1051 Quartermaster company group [1051st Quartermaster Service Group Aviation Company] serviced the 332nd?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So the 332nd, basically, was an entirely black company.  Was that true?
Speaker 2: It was a fighter group.  And they were known later on as the Tuskegee Airmen.  All of us, later on became, when the war [World War II, WWII] was over, as a Tuskegee Airman experience.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Experiment?
Speaker 2: Experiment, um-hm.
Story_ID: 577036
Speaker 1: Tell us just a little bit about the 1051 Quartermaster company [1051st Quartermaster Service Group Aviation Company].  Where did you join them and where did you go?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We joined them, as I said a few minutes ago, in Oscoda, Michigan.  And when we arrived there, they were packing, on their way overseas to fight.  The whole group, 332nd Fighting Group [332nd Fighter Group; 332nd Expeditionary Operations Group], were in that process of preparation for overseas duty.  And they gave us, let us say, a two week vacation to visit home before we went overseas.  Maybe it was ten days, or--I've forgotten how long it was.  So when we got there, they gave us permission to go back home and see our parents and friends before we shipped off overseas.  And that was one experience that I shall never forget.  I was on this train going to Selma, Alabama, and there was a long line of people waiting to go into the dining car.  And they were all white people.  And I had on my soldier's uniform, going home before I shipped off overseas.  And the head waiter came and looked at me, he said, "Okay.  You, soldier, come with me."  So, oh, I'm getting VIP treatment.  He took me around all of those white people to the coach, dining room coach and sat me down in a corner, and this whole line were waiting to come in, and of course the place was filled, and as people completed their meal, they brought other people in.  They set me at this corner, and when he set me at this corner, wow.  All it was, the waiter reached up, and pulled down a black curtain, down to the floor here (gesture).  Another black curtain down to the floor here, another black curtain, he had me sitting in this black room.  And I thought, wow, what I thought was the VIP treatment had turned out to be a segregation, a prime example of segregation.  And, of course, I sat there and ate the food and that was a downgrade for me.  And that was one of the tough things that I ran into going back home, because, once you're out of segregation, you kind of forget that it exists.  Then all at once, bang, it's right before you.  It does exist and you better obey.  And it comes in all kind of direction.
Story_ID: 577037
Speaker 1: Did you become familiar with any of the soldiers who trained at Tuskegee Airfield [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  What we did basically, as I said before, we were the--what else should I say, we were the messes and the Pathmark of the 332nd Fighter Group [332nd Expeditionary Operations Group].  We had one warehouse for food, all the food.  And we had another warehouse for all the clothing, and we ran both of these warehouses.  And they would come up to us every morning and get their supply of food, and then their supply of clothing.  Just like, John Doe needed a pair of shoes at 332nd.  They requisitioned him a pair of shoes sized nine and a half, and they would come with this requisition, "We want one pair of shoes, size five, I mean five nine, size nine, and two pair of shoes, size whatever."  And we would pipe them up, give them to them, and they would take them back to their area.  And that's how they got their clothing.
Speaker 1: And when the soldiers would, when the soldiers were--when you were servicing the 332nd, had the 99th fighter group [99th Pursuit Squadron] merged with the 332nd at that point (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.  When we arrived in Italy, the 99th was in North Africa and they merged.  They took the 99th, brought them over to Italy with us and became a part of 332nd Fighter Group.
Speaker 1: And do you have any information about why that merger happened?
Speaker 2: Well, they couldn't put them--they couldn't merge the black man with the white man, so they merged them with the other black fellows.  It's just that simple.  They couldn't merge it with the white, so they merged it with the black.
Speaker 1: Now, you're going to Italy with the 1051 [1051st Quartermaster Service Group Aviation Company], which means that you are--that the companies are going overseas.  Do you know anything about the story about Eleanor Roosevelt visiting Tuskegee and creating the permission (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --or the ability for the black soldiers to go overseas?  Would you tell us a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: I only read and heard about it, and I met the man [Charles Alfred Anderson] later on who took her on this ride.  He died about five years ago, by the way.
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: I've forgotten the name (laughter).  But I met him at a convention, and here in the highest level of government were these white men talking about, "The black men can't fly a plane because the arteries in his brains are smaller than the arteries in the white man.  Therefore, when he takes those sudden climbs up, and we take the sudden turns round, and dive, that the blood in his small veins could not do for him what the white man's blood does in the large veins," (laughter).  "And, therefore, he cannot fly.  Nature has made him this way."  And this was the big intellectual argument in [U.S.] Congress, that he can't do it because of this reason.
Speaker 1: But meanwhile--
Speaker 2: Meanwhile, Mrs. Roosevelt heard about it.  She went down there to Tuskegee, and she got on--went and asked to be--she inspected, and asked to be carried, to be flown by a black pilot.  And she was flown by this black pilot and came down, she went back to Washington [D.C.] and told her husband [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] that, "As the president of the United States and my husband, I want you to use your influence to give those black pilots a chance to fly.  Because I have flown with them, and I know they can fly."  And that's what he did.  And for that reason, they were given--the War Department [U.S. Department of War] gave them more money to train black pilots.  And this was back in, what, 1940, something like that.
Story_ID: 577038
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about some of the individuals who were a part of the 332nd [332nd Fighter Group; 332nd Expeditionary Operations Group], like Benjamin O. Davis [Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.]?  Do you have any stories about him (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, he was commanding officer of all of us, and a handsome, tall, athletic young man.  I never saw him smile.  He was tough.  He went to West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York], and they made him tough.  He was the only black at West Point at the time he went, and they would not speak to him outside of the classroom setting.  They, he would come into class--
Speaker 1: How many years does one spend at West Point?
Speaker 2: It's a four year training period (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How many--yes.
Speaker 2: Come in the room and be taught, and walked out of the room, and nobody would speak to him.  And, of course, that will make you or break you.  And with him, it made him.  And he was tough.  And the man knew what he was doing because he had to sit out there and figure it out, and he said that, "Nothing will stop me.  I'll go on and succeed."  And that's what we need to do right now.  Get smart.  Don't get mad.  If you get mad, and you can rah, rah, you know.  However, think.  Sit around the table, plan, think, and then attack.  That's what get it done.  Learn the system from A to Z, and then use that system to get what you want, 'cause it's out there.
Speaker 1: What about William Thompson [HistoryMaker Colonel William R. Thompson]?  Do you know that name?
Speaker 2: Thompson, not much, really not much.  James--what is, what's James name?  He was the first four star general.  Chappie James [Daniel "Chappie" James, Jr.], everybody know about Chappie James.  He received his four stars before any other black pilot, so he was terrific.  But no contact with him, but the colonel we had contact with, he would come by and inspect and go on, like that.
Speaker 1: And what about [HistoryMaker] Earl Strayhorn?  Do you know that name?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, we, we heard about him.
Story_ID: 577039
Speaker 1: You see, what we did [as part of the 1051st Quartermaster Service Group Aviation Company], were to supply food and clothing, and that was it.  We, we didn't have--for example, a chaplain of 332nd [332nd Fighter Group; 332nd Expeditionary Operations Group], because we were--we dealt with food and clothing.  We needed a warehouse made out of brick.  And they put us in brick warehouses, and we worked out of these warehouses.  We tried tents, but tents would not do it.  So we worked out of a brick environment.  And because we worked out of a brick environment, we were isolated from the airfield.  They had to come to us, and the chaplain seldom came to us.  So I started, you know what?  A Sunday school class, and every Sunday morning I would have service through my Sunday school class.  I kept up with it a little bit too.  And the lieutenant came to me one day and said, "You know, we haven't had communion in a long time.  Since you teach Sunday school here, can you give us communion?"  Well, I thought about it.  I'm not a preacher, and I had no authority to give communion, to bless communion.  However, in an isolated situation where there is no preacher, and I'm the one teaching Sunday school, I think that I also have the authority to give communion if the men want it.  And on those grounds, I'll give you communion.  And for the first time in my life, I went out and bought wine, went out and bought wine.  And I knew the rituals.  I came back, had the cook to cook me some bread that was without salt, broke it up, and had prayer over this.  And then I served it to them, and we had communion (laughter).  Maybe they'll put me in jail for being a preacher without license (laughter).
Story_ID: 577040
Speaker 1: Were there any other--I'm not sure what you would be titled--a cadet?  Or a--soldiers who were from Alabama?  Or who you later knew who lived in New York?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I--most of my friends in 1051st [1051st Quartermaster Service Group Aviation Company] were from Ohio, most of them.  You see, 332nd [332nd Fighter Group; 332nd Expeditionary Operations Group] trained also in Ohio.  In Tuskegee [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama] and in Ohio, in Columbus, Ohio.  And many of my friends in 1051st Quartermaster came out of Ohio.  And I knew them because, for some reason, they put them in this experimental group.
Speaker 1: And what of--I have a couple of names of people from New York like Roscoe Brown [HistoryMaker Roscoe C. Brown] and Lee Archer [Lee A. Archer]?
Speaker 2: Everybody knows Roscoe Brown, yes, yes.  He was the first American flier to shoot down a German jet.  And not only did he shoot the German jet down, he came back and got a Ph.D. in mathematics, and became the president of one of the local colleges.  So he's been active in civil rights and in the community all of his life, ever since he came out of the [U.S.] Army.  Everybody knows Roscoe Brown.
Speaker 1: What about Lee Archer?
Speaker 2: Lee Archer, he's the ace of all the black pilots, and he lives up in New Rochelle [New York].  So, being an ace gives you a special recognition.  In fact, they have, what we call, a chapter named after Lee Archer.  And he's still alive, so that's quite an honor.  So you see this chapter on my cap?
Speaker 1: Claude B. Govan?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tri-State Chapter [Claude B. Govan Tri-State Chapter]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Govan is G-O-V-A-N.
Speaker 2: Right.  We have a chapter named Lee Archer, and that's quite an honor to be alive and have a chapter named after you.
Speaker 1: And are the chapters designed to celebrate your past service, or are they chapters that you were a part of while you were in service?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It's, we're--we are celebrating what we did.  And we are projecting it to the youth, and encouraging them to educate a little more.  Nothing you want to do is impossible.  Do it.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you one more name before we talk a little bit about outreach?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is Percy Sutton a Tuskegee Airman?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a, he was one of the Tuskegee Airmen.  He was financial officer.  Yes, he was one of the Tuskegee Airmen.  Right.
Story_ID: 577041
Speaker 1: We were talking about your being a Tuskegee Airman, and in particular, we were talking about your chapters which celebrate your past experience and work to--work with youth.  How do you and your colleagues work with the youth to bring them the message that you have from being a Tuskegee Airman (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes. We give lectures, and we give scholarships, and we use the name.  You see, I wear this name for a purpose, and the purpose is to get the name out there, to draw people's attention to the name.  And they want to know what did you do, and we explain.  And more people than you could imagine see me on the street and start a conversation with me because of the name they see up there.  And that's one of our objectives, to get the name out there and to stimulate somebody else to go on another level.
Speaker 1: Now, who is Claude B. Govan?
Speaker 2: Govan was one of the great fighters, one of the--from this area.  And he was a very good citizen, as well as a good fighter in 332nd [332nd Fighter Group; 332nd Expeditionary Operations Group].  And because of his outstanding contribution, they decided to name this chapter after him.
Story_ID: 577042
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you a couple of questions that I think I have missed.  While you were in Europe, do--does the situation for you and the other black workers and fighters improve?  So are you treated better in Europe, simply, than you are in the United States (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, you were treated better in Europe than in America.
Speaker 1: And how were you treated better?
Speaker 2: That flag and the passport really put you on another level, and you can feel it, just like that.
Speaker 1: And in relationship to the U.S. Army, are you getting better equipment and support when you're in Europe than when you are stateside?
Speaker 2: Well, in Europe, we were on the battlefield, so we had to have the best, what everybody else had.  And when you have the best, you apply your best, also.  And you become a different person to have that confidence, more confidence in yourself.
Speaker 1: Can you just tell me a couple of items that would have been better?  I'm assuming you're getting better planes.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What other kinds of supplies are you getting that are improved once you're in Italy, and in Europe generally.
Speaker 2: On the battlefield, in the war [World War II, WWII], or just as a citizen now?
Speaker 1: In the war?
Speaker 2: I'm thinking of a situation wherein where the men were ordered to escort the bombers over Berlin [Germany] for the first time.  And the P-51 [North American Aviation P-51 Mustang] that we were flying, they were flying, didn't have the extensive travel range to Berlin.  And some of the ground crew knew where tanks were, so they went and they had to have special red tape permission to receive these tanks to give our P-51 that extended flight range.  So they went and were having a problem with it, so they went and took the tanks for the P-51.  They were United States tanks, underbelly tanks, so that they knew where they went, took them and put them on the plane.  And some of the fellows who requested the Red Tail to escort them over Berlin, were the same fellows who didn't want black fighters escort in the first place.  But they had done so well with them until they said, "Hey, better get those Red Tails to go with us on this first flight."
Speaker 1: Why were you dubbed Red Tails?
Speaker 2: Because the tails were painted red, and the nose of the plane was painted red, and because of that red tail, that whole back of the plane painted red, you could see this, just like that.
Story_ID: 577043
Speaker 1: And many pilots who saw the red plane tails, and the B-24s [Consolidated B-24 Liberator] didn't know that they were black flying them (laughter).  I think in one case, we're in--a group of pilots, came to the camp one day.  They had been in trouble and the Red Tails got them out of trouble.  So they came, after they went to the base, they came up, said, "We're looking for the Red Tails."  And they guys said, "We are the Red Tails."  They said, "You are the Red Tails?  But you're black."  (Laughter) "Yes, we are the Red Tails."  And the attitude changed.  "Look, on our next mission, can you pick us up?"  They didn't first want to assign the Red Tails for the protection of the B-24 bombers.  They didn't, but they start losing so many.  Then they realized that, "Hey, you've got a whole bunch of Negroes down there with those red tails.  Gotta put 'em into action."  And they were drawn into action.  You see, at first they gave the 332nd [332nd Fighter Group; 332nd Expeditionary Operations Group] only scraping jobs.  You know, shooting railroads, convoys, and bridges and that kind of thing.  And all at once they realized, we need these guys up here to protect these B-24s, we're losing so many.  And when they put them there to protect the B-24s, the orders came down from Colonel B.O. Davis [Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.] to when you protect a B-24, you stay close by and never leave that plane, and that's what was different with the 332nd.  When they escorted a B-24 over, they hugged that plane.  Anything came up, boom, knock him out, and that is what made them different, that strategy.
Speaker 2: Other escorts were not necessarily maintaining contact with the plane that they were protecting?
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.  It was, it was Colonel Davis, whose orders was to stick with the B-24s and never leave them until you got over free territory.
Speaker 2: Now, can you talk a little bit about being a fighter?  The 332nd is a fighting unit?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a fighter group.
Speaker 2: It's a fighter group, so you do in fact fight, drop bombs and shoot people, you say, on these trained convoys and so forth?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: But, presumably, the 332nd are not the pilots who were making these main missions; is that the--is that true?
Speaker 1: Right.  The B-24s would drop the big bombs, but they needed protection going over the target.  Because a German plane would come up and knock 'em out, take 'em out.  However, when they started getting fighter escorts, then the P-51 [North American Aviation P-51 Mustang] with their maneuverability would knock him out before they got a chance to knock the bomber out.
Speaker 2: Do you know if any of the black pilots were interested in being bombers, or were--how did they feel about being escorts, about that position?  Did people have aspirations to do other jobs that they were unable to do?
Speaker 1: Yeah, you see, the black mind's just like any other mind.  We're not all in one, all doesn't want to do one thing.  If one want to do a fighter pilot, another want to be a helicopter pilot, another want to be a gunner.  And we have several persons in our chapter that was gunners on a B-25 [North American B-25 Mitchell].
Speaker 2: What's a gunner (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A gunner--
Speaker 2: Okay.  So it's shooting.
Speaker 1: Shooting, right.  And we were just like anybody else.  One want to do this thing, one want to train in this thing, one want to teach math, one want to teach psychology, one want to teach religion.  Same thing with the fighters.
Story_ID: 577044
Speaker 1: Will you talk a little bit about the integration of the [U.S.] military as a result of the Tuskegee experiment's success?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, of course, once they realized the ability of black men to fly, then that not only meant accepting them as protectors, but when the war [World War II, WWII] ended, ended that was the American Airlines, or whatever airline there was, growing by leaps and bounds and needing pilots.  And respecting their ability to maneuver, they encouraged them to apply and be accepted.  Of course, they had to fight for that too.
Speaker 1: This is, these are commercial airlines?
Speaker 2: These are commercial airlines.
Speaker 1: Once you were back stateside?
Speaker 2: And that would change the whole complexion of commercial airlines.
Speaker 1: I see.  And how did the effect of President Truman's [President Harry S. Truman] executive order in 1948, do you know a little about the proximity of that, and the effect that it had on the military once it was passed?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He--after some of his top generals told him that it wouldn't work, he looked at it from common sense point of view.  God has given all of us common sense.  It's no point in separation when these people are doing the same thing.  It doesn't make sense.  So put 'em together and let them do the same thing.  And that's what Truman did.  And by the way, Truman received this award.  He was one to receive this award.  And we appreciate a man who didn't finish college, but had conviction.  You don't have to have a Ph.D. to have wisdom, and that's what Truman had in making this decision.  Doesn't make sense, having two armies; a black one and a white one.  Put 'em together.
Story_ID: 577045
Speaker 1: Is it true that the Tuskegee Airmen, as escorts, never lost a bomber?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We never lost a bomber.  They have been doing research at the Pentagon [Washington, D.C.], and somebody come up with, "Yeah, I saw them, I have proof that they lost one bomber."  I don't know who that fellow was.
Speaker 1: I actually read that they claimed this year that they had lost twenty-five bombers.  And that was the new information.
Speaker 2: They gonna make it more, because they are jealous of this.
Speaker 1: And what is that?
Speaker 2: This is--
Speaker 1: You might want to pick it up and let us take a look at it.
Speaker 2: Yes.  This is the Congressional Gold Medal of Honor [sic. Congressional Gold Medal].
Speaker 1: When did you receive this gold medal?
Speaker 2: On the 29th of March, this year.
Speaker 1: Fantastic.  Will you tell us--
Speaker 2: Given only by the president.  It has to be passed by the [U.S.] Senate and the congressional authority, and then signed by the president.  And we had never won this before.  You know, during World War II [WWII], now there are two medals.  One is the Congressional Medal of Honor only for soldiers, and this is Congressional Gold Medal of Honor which can be given to civilians and soldiers.  And this is a higher step, both of them are at the top.  And this is what they gave all of us.
Speaker 1: And what is your idea about why they decided to issue the Congressional Gold Medals to Tuskegee Airmen?
Speaker 2: Because we had done a terrific job of togetherness to keep this nation up on the level where it should be.  And after sixty-two years, they decided.  We give thanks to Congress- Congressman Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel] from New York [New York] who wrote the bill that the organization, ground crew and flyers, should receive this medal.
Speaker 1: Now, is that medal that you're holding in your hand, is that gold?
Speaker 2: No.  This is copper.  There is one gold medal in Smithsonian museum [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.].  It stays there and all of us that are still alive, they gave us--this is the identical medal, but made of copper.  And this is what we have.
Speaker 1: Just.
Speaker 2: Like this?
Speaker 1: Maybe you could turn it over?
Speaker 2: Turn it over?  Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: So--and then if you could turn it this way--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --so that we could take a look at it.  So there are three planes on one side representing the 99th [99th Pursuit Squadron], the 332nd [332nd Fighter Group; 332nd Expeditionary Operations Group] and the 477th [477th Bombardment Group; 477th Fighter Group].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: And you have these three faces on this side.
Story_ID: 577046
Speaker 1: Do the Tuskegee Airmen have a special flight song?
Speaker 2: Do we have a special--?
Speaker 1: Flight song?
Speaker 2: A flight--you know, we used to say nothing can stop the [U.S.] Army Air Corps.  You live in flame and you die in flame.  Nothing can stop the Army Air Corps.  It's now [U.S.] Air Force.
Speaker 1: I was about to ask, by the time you finished your service, were you a member of the Air Force?  Or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: How did that transition work?
Speaker 2: Right.  General, I mean, President Truman [President Harry S. Truman] changed--sent that order down in late 1945 [sic.], and I got out at the end of 1945.  But the order had been sent through, but I was out and going back to Alabama.
Speaker 1: Where were you when the war [World War II, WWII] ended?
Speaker 2: In Italy.  Right in Italy, only a few miles from Mount Vesuvius.  It blew its top one day, and it was right in the midst of us.  Never forget that morning.  We thought the Germans had created a new weapon when the top of the mountain blew.  It had blown about two hundred years ago, and wow, the smoke, dust, and ash came down on us.  Knocked tents down, we had to put on gas masks, we had to change the whole plan of things until we found out what it was and where it was coming from.  And that was corrected.  We had to get out the shovels, and just like doing it snow style, and cleared the pathway for trucks and vehicles to go.  And tents collapsed and all that kind of thing because of this cinder dust and heavy stuff that came out of that mountain.  I was on a tourist trip, two years ago, in Italy, and the drivers as we passed by said, "That's Mount Vesuvius.  It exploded in 1944 before I was born."  And I said, "Yeah, I was there, and that smoke almost killed me," (laughter). "You were there?"  "Yes, I was down the road a piece when that thing exploded."  Yes.
Speaker 1: So not long after that the war ended?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it wasn't long after that that the war ended.
Speaker 1: And so what was your--
Speaker 2: Forty-four [1944], it was in 1944, and the war ended in 1945.
Speaker 1: And what did you do once the war ended?  You packed up, I mean, what was your trajectory?
Speaker 2: I was honorably discharged from the [U.S.] Armed Forces, and went back to Alabama.
Speaker 1: And did you consider any additional [U.S.] military service?
Speaker 2: They offered me--no, when I got in college [Livingstone College, Salisbury, North Carolina], they offered me a scholarship to the seminary to become a chaplain in the Armed Forces.  I said, "The Lord hadn't called me, so I'll say no." (Laughter) My friend, I won't call his name, said, "The Lord hasn't called me, but I'm gonna take it."  He took that scholarship, became a captain, a major and a full colonel.  And he told him, really, the Lord hadn't called him to do it, but he gonna accept that scholarship, and he died a full colonel.
Story_ID: 577047
Speaker 1: So you returned to Alabama?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what's it like when you return to Alabama?  What's the atmosphere like?  How do you feel?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: I know you go to college not too long after that, but let's just talk about, what is it like when you come back to the United States in 1945?
Speaker 2: Yes.  As I said some time ago, they gave me my honorable discharge--was it Fort McPherson [East Point, Georgia]? Something like that, outside of Atlanta [Georgia].  And thank God I'm free.  I go out and get a taxi, take me to the railroad station, and I got out of that cab with my bag in my hand, and went running to the station to buy a ticket to Alabama.  And as I stepped up on that bottom step, this white officer threw his arms up like this, said, "Boy, you can't come in here.  You gotta go around the corner.  Colored people don't enter this door.  You gotta go around the corner."  So well, you know, it came back to me.  I'm back home.  So I went around the corner and bought my ticket to go to Alabama.  And when I got to Alabama, "I'm gonna go and vote."  Went to Dallas courthouse, Dallas County Courthouse [Selma, Alabama].  "Miss, I would like to vote.  I just got my honorable discharge from the [U.S.] Army.  Here it is."  "All right.  Dabney [HistoryMaker Dabney N. Montgomery], here is three applications, and you get three white men to fill out these applications saying that you all right, and bring them back to me."  "Three applications filled out by white men?"  "Yes.  That's the law.  I have to go by the law."  So I got three applications, and found three white men that would fill them out, and each one gave me own lecture about, "You got to be a good boy.  Don't try to tear things down."  But they signed it, filled it out and signed it.  Took them back to this lady, and when I took them back to the lady, she says, "Now do you own one thousand dollars' worth of land?"  "One thousand dollars' worth of land?  No.  I have three thousand dollars in the bank, two blocks from here."  "No, no, not the cash money you have, the ownership of land."  "I don't own any land."  "Well, you can't vote.  The law says you have to own one thousand dollars' worth of land to vote in Alabama."  "You gotta be a landlord to vote?"  "Yeah, that's the law."  And a white fellow standing behind me stepped up to that desk, just got out of the Army, came to register to vote, here's your paper, boom, filled it out.  Okay.  I stood back in the corner and saw this.  One day, revenge, you'll get my revenge (laughter).  And I went to college [Livingstone College, Salisbury, North Carolina], and became active in the Civil Rights Movement.
Story_ID: 577048
Speaker 1: Where did you attend college?
Speaker 2: Livingstone College in Salisbury, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: And this is the college that your minister--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --had read, had flagged for you.
Speaker 2: Yes.  On the grounds that you study here and become a preacher.  And, "The Lord told me that you are to go in the ministry."  And I said, "Tell the Lord to come and tell me to join the ministry and I'll go.  But I'm not going until he comes and tells me to go."
Speaker 1: But that advice was still close enough that you majored in religious education.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And how did you find that?  Was it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How did I find out?
Speaker 1: I meant, how was that for you?  Was that still interesting?  Was it still your passion?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your time at Livingstone College, the teachers there, and your experience?
Speaker 2: I, again, enjoyed religion because I was brought up in it.  And I majored in it, and this is where I accepted the social gospel.  That religion is not a thing you go on Sundays, and praise the Lord, and clap your hands, and "Oh, you've done my job now.  Let's do anything else you want to do."  Religion is living, is the way you live, how you live, your attitude.  And to improve the environment around you is part of your religion.  And I started reading all the books as it was necessary to do to pass the courses.  And I became a very good fan of nonviolence by reading (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) At this time while you're in college?
Speaker 2: Yes, '46 [1946] to '49 [1949].
Speaker 1: What motivates you in 1946 and 1949 to get focused on nonviolence?  What's happening that--
Speaker 2: The teaching, the teaching of my religious courses.  And that was a gentleman by the name of Dean Satterwhite [John H. Satterwhite] who came from Oberlin College [Oberlin, Ohio], by the way.  He was a main factor in nonviolence was the way, and I believed it.  And as I studied it, I became more and more a part of it.
Speaker 1: Did your [U.S.] military service have any impact?  Earlier you were saying, you know, getting angry is nonproductive.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What's important is that we be productive and successful.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So do you feel that your childhood and your military service fed into your idea that nonviolence was the superior way?
Speaker 2: Yes.  The whole life experience fed into that idea of nonviolence.  It's the way to solve problems.  Dean Satterwhite and I talked about this, and we talked about this.  And in 1949, I didn't hear a voice out of the sky or anything.  I just got a thought.  When the laws of the state conflict with the conscience of man, the laws of the state should be peacefully broken.  In '49 [1949], and this got me into trouble (laughter).
Speaker 1: How did that get you into trouble?  You were breaking laws (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I couldn't shake it off.  I couldn't shake it off.  It was on me.
Speaker 1: So then, did you participate in nonviolent breaking of laws?
Speaker 2: Before I left Livingstone, I went back.  See, I had studied religion up until '49 [1949] and I got a degree.  Then I said, "Well, I believe I'll go and study economics.  Come back after my degree and get thirty hours in economics, and go and become an authority on China and Africa, and make my way into the United Nations [UN] and state department [U.S. Department of State], et cetera."  I was hoping to get a Ph.D. by 1957, and devote my life to world arts.  The economic structure of the world and how it relates to the justice and the peace in the world.  And I said, "I'll do that."  So I went back to thirty hours in 1950, and I left and went to get an advanced degree in the area of economic structure.
Story_ID: 577049
Speaker 1: So you graduated with your degree in religious education from Livingstone [Livingstone College, Salisbury, North Carolina] in 1949, and you decide to go to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] to study economics.  What happens there?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I came back to Livingstone in '49 [1949] and took thirty hours in economics, and then I went to the University of Michigan.  All the time, this passion to break a law, segregated law, and do nothing but accept whatever happened, but sit there.  I couldn't break away from it.  So I took the economics as an escape from going to Alabama and doing this, and I talked it over with the dean of the seminary.  And he said that, "Dabney [HistoryMaker Dabney N. Montgomery], if you do it, I cannot tell you not to do it.  But if you do it, you might get killed.  But if you get killed, you will die for something greater than life itself."  And I was saying, "I won't go."  So I went to Michigan.
Speaker 1: So were you interested in going to the South and participating in sit-ins?
Speaker 2: Going to Selma [Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Go into Selma according to what the feeling was.  To go to Selma at Clinton Chapel [Clinton Chapel A.M.E. Zion Church], and Dean Satterwhite [John H. Satterwhite] told me, "Look, just don't go and do it.  You go to a congregation and tell people what you're doing and why.  Then go and do it."  But I said, "No, I won't go."  So there was a meeting at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] on how should a Christian stand up against segregation.  And he called me to come down to this meeting at Howard.  It was in the seminary.  And I went down and explained my sense of nonviolence as a way and means of ending segregation.  And they gave me, what, five, six minutes to do it.  So when I finished, the gentleman leading the group said, "Thank you very much Mr. Montgomery.  We'll call the next speaker."  And Dean Satterwhite and I looked at each other, so that's when I went, and went into after I failed in economics.
Story_ID: 577050
Speaker 1: I went to something radical, ballet, as something that would keep me out.  And well, I'll go to Selma, but I'll take ballet, put it in the high school there, and any student who studied ballet would be exempted from the physical education requirement.  So I went to Boston Conservatory.
Speaker 2: Had you danced before?
Speaker 1: Never.  My father [Dred Montgomery] said, "There will be no dancing in this house."  And I didn't dance.
Speaker 2: Had you had any interest in dancing before?
Speaker 1: I saw a ballet team, and I was inspired by them.  And for this reason, I wanted to carry their art into country Selma, Alabama (laughter).
Speaker 2: Where did you see this ballet team?
Speaker 1: Possibly in Raleigh [North Carolina].
Speaker 2: North Carolina (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Somewhere in the South.  I've forgotten the location.  But, possibly, because we had gone to Raleigh for several culture events.  And as an escape, I said, "Okay.  I'm failing in everything, so I'll go back to Selma, but I'll take the ballet."  And I enrolled in Boston [Massachusetts] at the Boston Conservatory of Music [Boston Conservatory at Berklee], and I took private lessons, four hours, five hours per day I was putting into this.  And broke my foot, my left foot here.  Then I said, "Okay.  Maybe if I go across Africa, I will forget this passion that I have.  And maybe I'll forget the whole idea of going back to Selma."  So they took my leg out of a cast from here to there, from breaking it in ballet.  And I got on a boat and went across North Africa, and amazing, the experience I had going across there.  I went into Athens, Greece, and the day we arrived in Athens, Greece, we went to the three thousand year theater [Acropolis, Athens, Greece].  And they were doing Beethoven's '9th Symphony' ['Symphony No. 9,' Ludwig van Beethoven] with the Athens choir and symphony orchestra [City of Athens Symphony Orchestra and Choir].  And I came in and climbed up, and sat way to the right, or to the left of the stage.  And as I listened to the fourth movement, my watch jumped off my arm.  They were doing it in German.  My watch just fell off my arm, and as I sat there, I was so carried away with this, until--it was a clear night in August 1953.  I looked up to my right, and I swear until this day, I saw at least a dozen or more angels flying in that sky.  Maybe they were, maybe they're not, but I saw them.  I was so overjoyed and carried away, and I decided to take this fourth movement of Beethoven's '9th Symphony,' and make it a theme of that movement of, "When the law of the state violates the conscience of man, the law of the state should be peacefully broken."  And they were doing it in German.  And I came back, looked it up in Boston library in English, and they were saying exactly what I wanted to say.  Brothers run your race, run your race.  Gosh, how did this happen?  Then I moved to New York [New York], and when I moved to New York, I enrolled at Metropolitan Opera school of ballet [Metropolitan Opera Ballet School, New York, New York].

Speaker 1: Having never been a dancer, how is it that you get yourself accepted to the Boston Conservatory [Boston Conservatory of Music; Boston Conservatory at Berklee, Boston, Massachusetts] and later to the Met [Metropolitan Opera Ballet School, New York, New York] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I took beginners' classes.
Speaker 1: And you just did it?
Speaker 2: I took beginners' classes and did it four and five hours per day.  I did it.  I was in the best physical condition in my whole life.  Four and five hours per day, that ballet exercising.  And that's where I met Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and his wife.  I went to Sunday school at the Union Methodist Church [Union United Methodist Church, Boston, Massachusetts], and I taught Sunday school while taking ballet at this church, at the Union Methodist Church.
Speaker 1: Is this--what city is this in?
Speaker 2: Boston [Massachusetts].  And as I studied ballet and taught Sunday school, one of the older ladies said, "I'm gonna make you my son.  You gonna be my son."  And, "Okay, I'll accept that.  I'll be your son.  I need all the help I need, I could get."  "Come over to my house Sunday and we'll fix a meal for you, and you'll meet my other son and his fiancee."  So that Sunday, I went over to her house late in the afternoon on my bicycle.  And there, I walked in and she said, "Meet Martin Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott [Coretta Scott King], his fiancee.  This is my other son."  And we had a long night of conversation.  Never about the civil rights, but young men talking about conditions around them, et cetera.  And we became friends at that time.
Speaker 1: And had you followed Martin Luther King, Jr.'s career prior to meeting him?
Speaker 2: No.  He was a student.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a student.  He working on his Ph.D. at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts].  And Coretta was studying voice at New England Conservatory of Music [Boston, Massachusetts], which was next door to the YMCA [Huntington Avenue YMCA, Boston, Massachusetts], and I lived in the YMCA, and that's where I did all my exercising.  And, well, when they got married, they sent me an invitation, and I said, "If I had known they would become famous, I would have kept that invitation."  (Laughter) They got married in Marion, Alabama.  She was an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] Zion thirty miles from Selma [Alabama], and knew many of the people that I knew, and that was a connecting point.  And, well, I still had that urge to go.  Now, one of my schoolmates was named Johns, his father was Reverend Johns [Vernon Johns] who was one of the most dynamic preachers in America.  He was the pastor of Ebenezer, the church in Montgomery, Alabama [sic. Dexter Avenue Baptist Church; Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church, Montgomery, Alabama].  But he was so radical in his approach in segregation.  In fact, he went and just broke the law.  They never arrested him because they said, "You crazy."  And the deacon fired him.  And when they fired him, later on, they hired Martin Luther King to be the pastor (laughter).
Story_ID: 577052
Speaker 1: Well, getting back to the story, I left Boston [Massachusetts] and came to New York [New York].
Speaker 2: Well, didn't you go to Africa first?
Speaker 1: I went to Africa first, and then went back to Boston (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You went to--and then now, when you came back, you went to Boston, and then how did you decide to move to New York?  Why did you do that?
Speaker 1: Because I thought another change would help me.
Speaker 2: And all of this is because you're feeling this urge to return to Selma [Alabama]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and to work in civil rights and--
Speaker 1: To break the law--
Speaker 2: --to break the law nonviolently.
Speaker 1: --and nonviolently.  And that was the whole reason.
Speaker 2: And so this is like a calling for you, and it's just really hanging in there with you.
Speaker 1: It was hanging in that I couldn't throw off.  And on this trip, I met a lady on the island of Majorca [Spain], and we fell in love (laughter).  I said, "Maybe a wife will settle this."  So we got engaged back in '53 [1953].   On that trip through Africa, through Athens [Greece], on this island of Majorca, we got engaged.  And I came back--
Speaker 2: What was her name?
Speaker 1: Pepita [ph.].  Her name was really Maria Bonia [ph.], but I called her Pepita.  I asked her to marry me, she said, "Yes."  And I wrote her father, would he give me her hand in marriage.  I was in Boston and New York, and he said, "No.  She's my only child, and I want her to stay in the Spanish culture."
Speaker 2: Where was she from?  She was from Majorca (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She was from Majorca, Majorca right under Spain.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So she wasn't travelling also.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  She was right under Spain.  In the Mediterranean Sea.  And she, well, that broke up our engagement.  I thought a wife would solve my problem with this going back to Selma.
Speaker 2: So if you had taken her as a wife, did you plan to live in Boston or--
Speaker 1: I don't know what would have happened.  I don't know.  I don't have no answer for that.  I was thinking, oh, if I did this, maybe this would cut this off.
Speaker 2: And why was it so important to you to cut off this sensation that you had to not enter this fray?  And I understand the warning from your teacher [John H. Satterwhite] and reverend, who said you--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --might die, but was that the fear?  Were you afraid that you were gonna--
Speaker 1: I was afraid, I had fear, I had everything.  So the father wrote me and said, "No.  I will not give my daughter your hand in marriage."  That sent me through another spin because I had fallen in love with this girl.  Nineteen fifty-three [1953], 1954 when the engagement was broken.  Well, I kept studying ballet and dislocated my spine.
Speaker 2: And now you're at the Met [Metropolitan Opera Ballet School] in New York?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Dislocated my spine leaping.  And when you leap to give an impression of stopping in the leap, you go to the top of the leap, and you move your torso forward, and it looks as if you are stopping.  But you're not.  You're just moving the torso forward and it give you that effect (gesture) of stopping in the air and that's what I was practicing and dislocated the spine.  And that was the end of that.
Story_ID: 577053
Speaker 1: And then there was the voice still, and go back, break the law.  Well, I continued and I said, "I have to go back."  The Civil Rights Movement came to Montgomery, Alabama.  Mrs. Rosa Parks broke the law, she sat on the bus and broke the law on the ground.  She didn't say it, but when the law of the state, it was violating her conscience.  She just sat there and didn't do anything.  I said, "Well, that idea is on the table.  I don't have to go with this idea because it's on the table."  When there wasn't, when the movement broke out in Montgomery, and the movement came to Montgomery, I couldn't hold back.  Even though the idea was on the table, I couldn't hold back, so I went to Selma [Alabama], and I slipped into Selma without my mother [Lula Anderson Montgomery] and father [Dred Montgomery] knowing I was there.
Speaker 2: What year are you slipping?
Speaker 1: This was around '57 [1957].  Around '57 [1957], and I went into Selma--I had told my father about this experience that I was having.  He said, "Boy, don't bother.  Let's just forget it.  You can't do anything about that, don't.  Forget it."  So because I couldn't shake it off, and I knew his position, I thought that I would ease into Selma and go through with it.  And follow the direction of Dean Satterwhite [John H. Satterwhite], who told me to go before an audience and tell them what I'm gonna do.  So I got into Selma on a Saturday night and went to my Sunday school teacher and told her what I planned to do.   She, "Oh, no, get out of this house, 'cause they'll get me too.  Go down to the inn, get a hotel, and God bless you, whatever you gonna do."  Went down, got this room in the motel.  Stayed and prayed all day Sunday, and Sunday night, I was to move to the church [Clinton Chapel A.M.E. Zion Church, Selma, Alabama] and make my statement.
Story_ID: 577054
Speaker 1: Well, I hadn't eaten all day, and at sundown, I called a taxi and went to church [Clinton Chapel A.M.E. Zion Church, Selma, Alabama].  They hadn't seen me in years.  They said, "The preacher is out of town tonight, Dabney [HistoryMaker Dabney N. Montgomery].  Why don't you give us the message?"  I said, "Yes," (laughter).  It was at this point that they started the hymn, they did a hymn and a prayer, et cetera.  And they called on me to give the message, and I got up and said, "When the laws of the state conflict with the conscience of man, the laws of the state should be peacefully broken."  They said, "No, no."  They caught on right away.  And part of this station, this statement was, "While we close the schools in the United States because we think we hate each other, the giant in the Orient is awakened.  And the next war will be that of technology, and if we close our schools, and close engineer, and scientists training and development, then we will not have the science, the scientists and the engineers to compete in the next global war."  And I went on to say that this nation should have an institution on the level of West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York] and in Annapolis [United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland] to train a diplomatic corps, to guide us through this chain of events.  This would be the answer to the problem that we faced.  And I said, "The giant in the near Far East, is awakened."  People got up and said, "No, no."  So I left the church and went to the bus depot.  They were closed.  I left there and went to a drugstore where white fellows hung out, they were locked closed.  So I went to the jail and asked to speak to the chief of police, and he came out with two of his policemen, and I said, "I have come here to break your segregated laws.  When the laws of the state violate the conscience of man, the laws of the state should be peacefully broken.  And I came here to break it."  And there was a fountain over here for colored, a fountain over there for white people.  I now go and drank out of this fountain for white people, and I went and drank out of that fountain.  They said, "Throw him out of here."   They came, grabbed my--one on this arm, one on that, threw me out.  I landed on the curb.  And when I landed on the curb at 9:30 at night in Selma, Alabama, the whole situation is quiet.  Everybody is in the house.  The sidewalks are rolled up.  This black fellow came by in the car and said, "Hey, look, what's wrong with you?"  I said, "What can I do for you?"  He asked me, "What can I do for you?  No black people's gonna be sitting on the curb this time of night."  I said, "Let me get in your car, and you take me to my home."  He put me in the car and I went to my father's house, and all the people from the church had gone to my father's house, and told him that I was back in town breaking segregated laws.  I knocked on the door, my father [Dred Montgomery] came, "Ah. There he is."  And my mother [Lula Anderson Montgomery] came, 1702 Green Street.  My father, old strong man, I never saw him on his knees before.  He fell on his knees saying, "Son, don't do it again.  They will kill us all.  They'll burn the house down.  We don't know what they will do."  And through tears and crying, I decided not to hurt my father, but I was supposed to go back and do it again.  In the meantime, my father jumped in the cab, go to the chief of police and said, "My son has been shell shocked in World War II [WWII] and he's back in town.  He doesn't mean any harm, but he's breaking laws."  And chief of police, "I knew something was wrong with him.  He's shell shocked."
Story_ID: 577055
Speaker 1: I came back home to New York City [New York, New York].  And then, Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came into Selma [Alabama], and the headquarters of the Civil Rights Movement was in Brown Chapel Church [Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church, Selma, Alabama], two blocks away from Clinton Chapel Church [Clinton Chapel A.M.E. Zion Church, Selma, Alabama], where I had been before.  And the people were some of my best friends and, "Dab [HistoryMaker Dabney N. Montgomery], you gonna be all right.  Don't worry, you gonna be all right.  Just leave it alone."  They were saying, "Well, I didn't think all this would happen."  And I took part in that movement and became Martin Luther King's volunteer bodyguard.  And we walked to Montgomery [Alabama] on that Edmund Pettus Bridge [Selma, Alabama], across that bridge, on to Montgomery.  And here, we got into Montgomery and I said that I heard the governor [George Wallace] looked down on that seventy thousand people strong, and said, "That's a lot of votes down there.  I had better change my position."  And he became, not pro, but he began to melt away his hardcore stance on segregation.
Speaker 2: This is Strom Thurmond [sic.]?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.  And I came back to New York after that march and my father [Dred Montgomery] died.  But my father came down to see us off on that march [Selma to Montgomery March].  He changed his mind.  He came down to see us off.  And as he came down, he said, "Well, look at that, people are getting together."  So he died, I had to go back to look after the property that he had left.  And the courthouse that we had walked to every day in Selma and prayed during that time of the King movement, in the rain, sunshine, cold weather, everything.  We walked to that courthouse where that woman had told me, "No, you cannot vote."  So when I walked in that courthouse [Dallas County Courthouse, Selma, Alabama], I said, "Let me go to the registration room."  And I went down to the registration room and there was a black woman sitting behind that desk (laughter).
Speaker 2: Did she sign you up to vote?
Speaker 1: I said, "Look, I was denied voting rights right here when I came out of the [U.S.] Army, and I was denied.  Do you deny anybody?"  She said, "Hell, no.  Anybody who come here that's getting--that's twenty-one years old and a citizen, I sit here and sign him up."  This is my revenge, this is my revenge.  And by the act of God, Martin Luther King and Coretta King [Coretta Scott King] received the Congressional Gold Medal of Honor [sic. Congressional Gold Medal].  By the act of God, Congressman Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel] passed that bill that the original Tuskegee Airmen would receive the Congressional Medal of- Gold Congressional Medal of Honor.  The same one that King got, that Mrs.--that broke the bus.
Speaker 2: Rosa Parks (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Rosa Parks.  And there is mine here. (Laughter) That's the end of my story (laughter).  No I didn't intend to go into all of that.  I didn't intend to go, by the act of God, there it is.

Speaker 1: This is my family as a young fellow at 1702 Green Street, Selma, Alabama.  My mother [Lula Anderson Montgomery] is standing on the back row to the left.  Next to her is my father, Dred [Dred Montgomery].  And down front is my sister, Esther [Esther Montgomery], and next to Esther is Fairrow Belle [Fairrow Belle Montgomery Prewitt], and there I am standing there next to Clyde [Clyde Montgomery] and behind Clyde there is Mitchel [Mitchel Montgomery], the oldest son.

Zion Church [Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, New York, New York].  That was the 16th day of October, 1971 and we had just gotten married, my wife, Amelia, and there I am.
Speaker 2: Will you spell Amelia, please?
Speaker 1: A-M-E-L-I-A.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) seven hundred people.
Speaker 1: No.  Here we are taking a picture in front of what I believe is C-17 [Boeing C-17 Globemaster III] in the year 2006.  Let's look at the picture to the left at the top there.  I am number two from the right--number three from the right.  And these are my other friends and brothers from the Tuskegee air squadron, original Tuskegee Airmen.  And this plane, [U.S.] Air Force plane, is named Spirit of the Tuskegee Airmen.  There you are at the very top to your left.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Left.  He didn't have that other.
Speaker 2: Is it picture left or our left?
Speaker 1: It's the picture left.  This is the one I'm talking about right here.

Speaker 1: Oh, the other one, these--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  The old one.  The--no, the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, these are men that was on that flight with us.  I don't have their name, but under us you have two and the two pilots on that plane.  And over to the right of that picture is one of the brethren and the two pilots on that plane.  Down further is International Black Aerospace Council.  That's a few of the brothers, original Tuskegee Airmen, had a formal dinner that night.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  And you are where?
Speaker 1: I'm not on--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --those pictures.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Where--
Speaker 1: I'm only on the other one.
Speaker 2: Which one?  Where?
Speaker 1: I'm--
Speaker 2: There?
Speaker 1: From the right, I am the third person from the right of that picture.  I am number three.
Speaker 2: And we're looking at--
Speaker 1: That's an old, that's an old--that--
Speaker 2: You aren't--
Speaker 1: No, I'm not in that one.
Speaker 2: I see.  Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm not in that one.  That looked like a B-25 [North American B-25 Mitchell].  A B--I don't see the other two motors for a B-24 [Consolidated B-24 Liberator], so that's a B-25.  We did have a--one or two B-25 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (AMELIA NEELY MONTGOMERY): (Simultaneous) There--it's just the Tuskegee Airmen flight.  Yeah.  And this was at the dedica--dedication ceremony down here in memory of these--of this particular time; that's what that's--okay.  We don't--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) The picture you're looking at there is Dabney Montgomery [HistoryMaker Dabney N. Montgomery] after he received the alumni of the year of Livingstone College [Salisbury, North Carolina] and the United Negro College Fund [UNCF] in Nashville, Tennessee on February the 10th--no, February the 2nd, 2007.  The alumni of the year, Livingstone College and the United Negro College Fund in Nashville, Tennessee.
Speaker 2: (AMELIA NEELY MONTGOMERY):  That was taken--that photo was taken for the purpose; it was not taken after, it was taken before the purpose of your receiving the award.
Speaker 1: Here I am in the Dead Sea in 1953, on that trip through North Africa and the Near East.  I'm standing there in the Dead Sea waving my hat, that's it.
Speaker 2: Don't stand up.
Speaker 1: The medal that you are looking at now is the Congressional Gold Medal of Honor [sic. Congressional Gold Medal] given to the Tuskegee Airmen on March the 29th, 2007, in the rotunda of the Capitol [U.S. Capitol, Washington, D.C.] by President Truman [sic.] and the speaker of the house, Mrs.--
Speaker 2: (AMELIA NEELY MONTGOMERY):  Nancy Pel--
Speaker 1: --Nancy Peloso?
Speaker 2: (AMELIA NEELY MONTGOMERY):  Pelosi.
Speaker 1: Pelosi [Nancy Pelosi], I believe, yes.  That is--there you have the three hundred Tuskegee Airmen as they rece- received the Congressional Medal of Honor [sic.].  If you look very closely, there I am about the center of that picture and to the left and I'm standing there, put on your spy glasses, I'm standing there with a few of my friends as we receive the Congressional Gold Medal of Honor and the rotunda of the capitol.  President Bush [President George Walker Bush] is down further, yes.  There he is with the speaker of the house.
Speaker 2: Here we're looking at a picture of the Mother A.M.E. Zion Church, men who cook.  This is one of the activities that we are part of at Mother Zion.  There I am with an apron on there and the pastor is right next to me, and there is other men there, Brother Walker [ph.], and pastor's son, and other of my friend, Brother Daniels [ph.] and Brother Jimmy Walker [ph.]--
Speaker 1: (AMELIA NEELY MONTGOMERY):  Welch [ph.].
Speaker 2: Welch. Men who cook at Mother AME Zion Church.
Speaker 1: This is a part of the Tuskegee Airmen [Tuskegee Airmen, Inc.] chapter Claude B. Govan Tri-State Chapter in New York City [New York, New York].  We are standing around a monument to us and the other black soldiers from the--what war was that?
Speaker 2: (AMELIA NEELY MONTGOMERY):  This was at the Eisenhower Park.
Speaker 1: Eisenhower Park in Long Island, New York [sic. East Meadow, New York].
Speaker 2: (AMELIA NEELY MONTGOMERY):  President of the--oh, this was the councilwoman--councilwoman for--
Speaker 1: Yes.  That's the councilwoman to the left and that's the man who donated it in the white jacket, and next to him is the president of our chapter, Ed Monroe.
Speaker 2: And where are you in the picture?
Speaker 1: I am over here to your left, the third from the left, on that picture, next to the man with the red jacket on.
Speaker 2: Third or the second?
Speaker 1: (AMELIA NEELY MONTGOMERY):  Third.
Speaker 2: Third.  Okay.
Speaker 1: The other men that are on other units that's on here that the monument represent is the Buffalo Soldiers, and I believe it is the 365th Tank Battalion [sic.] in World War II [WWII] and the Tuskegee Airmen.  This monument is dedicated to the three units.
Speaker 2: That's my Army discharge, honorable discharge, from the Army Air Corps [U.S. Army Air Corps; U.S. Air Force].  I believe the date is December 1945.  I received that and went flying to Selma, Alabama, and I'll always remember that as a part of my personal record, the honorable discharge from the United States Army.
Speaker 1: That's a picture of Dabney Montgomery as the historian of Mother A.M.E. Zion Church.  I'm squatting there down in Chinatown [New York, New York], and we are all looking at--we're standing on the ground where the church was first built--not built, but ready to house.  When we walked out of John Street [John Street United Methodist Church, New York, New York], we rented a house on the ground and we are now standing, and we're down to celebrate this night of what, 1796 adventure that started our church, and we are still going strong.  There you have it, the spot of the rented house where Mother A.M.E. Zion Church was.
Story_ID: 577057
Speaker 1: Yeah.  My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  It is February the 5th, 2008, and we're at Skadden Arps in Manhattan [Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, New York, New York].  And, sir, can you please state your full name for us and--
Speaker 2: The full name is [HistoryMaker] Dabney N. Montgomery.
Speaker 1: And we're finishing an interview that we started, I think, some months ago, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 577058
Speaker 1: Let me start with 1963, or '65 [1965], right?  Selma [Alabama], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, now did you talk in the last session of the March on Washington?  'Cause I know you attended the March on Washington.
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  I didn't talk about the March on Washington.
Speaker 1: Well, that's why--I think that's why my mind went to '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us about the March on Washington.  Now, you were working here in New York [New York], right, at the time?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was working here in New York City.
Speaker 1: Now, what was your job in those days?
Speaker 2: I was with welfare [Amsterdam Welfare Center, New York, New York] during those years.  And there were two marches on Washington [D.C.], both attended and addressed by Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  The first march on Washington [Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom] was 1957.  It was about ten thousand people there and Martin Luther King was the guest and preacher--speaker on that occasion.
Speaker 1: That was right after the Montgomery Bus Boycott, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, right after the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which started in 1955.  It received some publicity, but not as much as it should have.
Speaker 1: The march, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  That was the last time I saw Paul Robeson alive and well.  He was there at that march, but he didn't say anything.  He was not listed on the program.
Story_ID: 577059
Speaker 1: Did you know Paul Robeson personally?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't know him personally.  However, when I was at Livingstone College [Salisbury, North Carolina], he came to Livingstone and gave a recital.  And my job as a student was to see to it that the chapel was clean and to give the others water and be of any assistance to him that I could.  So I had water put aside for him and tea and during that recital, I had the honor of giving him a glass of water and when the recital was over, I had the honor of aiding him in his overcoat.  He was a tall fellow and I had to go up on my tiptoe in order to put his over--have him put that overcoat on.  So those were my only one on one contact with Paul Robeson.  He was a Alpha brother--
Speaker 1: Alpha Phi Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity]?
Speaker 2: Alpha Phi Alpha.  And it was a kind of comical thing that happened.  The grad chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha gave him a reception after the concert.  They did not invite the undergrad chapter to this reception, and, of course, we was stirred up about this and two or three of us sat down and actually planned to kidnap Paul Robeson to keep him from that reception.  And we didn't go through with the plan, we--he was a big man, and we didn't think that we could handle him, so that was reason we didn't go through with the plan, because he's a big man and we couldn't go through with it.
Speaker 1: Now, this would be 1947, '48 [1948], I guess (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Between '46 [1946] and '50 [1950], I was there at Livingstone.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Story_ID: 577060
Speaker 1: Now, did--I remember listening to the DVD of the previous interview, you mentioned Dean Satterwhite as a big influence on you in those days.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Dean Satterwhite was--I looked at him as my father, my college father [at Livingstone College, Salisbury, North Carolina].  He was the dean of Hood Seminary [Hood Theological Seminary, Salisbury, North Carolina] during that time and taught me a course in religion, and I was very impressed with him.  He was from Oberlin College [Oberlin, Ohio] and a very wise man, and I looked upon him as my college father, Dean John Satterwhite [John H. Satterwhite].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah.  Oberlin College, in those days, produced quite a few outstanding theologians.  One was, let's see, the famous one from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] who taught--you know who I'm talking about?  Oh, boy, I'm blocking out his name, but--
Speaker 2: He was--
Speaker 1: Thurman, yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: --from Howard?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Wallace Thurman [sic.], yeah.
Speaker 2: --recall him right now, but I know who you're talking about.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But there was one before him, Dr. Pollard [Robert Thomas Pollard].  He taught at Selma University in Selma, Alabama and Dr. Pollard was possibly one of the first Afro-Americans to graduate from Oberlin College.  Again, I was so impressed with these two men and my music teacher was from Oberlin, and I had another experience with another teacher from Oberlin College.  I have a--what shall I say, an admiration for Oberlin College; I've never been there, but I have been exposed to about four of its graduates who--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Oh--
Speaker 2: --influenced my life.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.  Howard Thurman is who I'm trying to think of.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And Gardner Taylor [HistoryMaker Reverend Gardner Taylor] here in Brooklyn [New York].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Those two are Oberlin men too.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Howard was the one that I had in mind.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Howard Thurman, right.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 577061
Speaker 1: So we were talking, talking about Robeson [Paul Robeson].  Now, when you were working here in New York [New York], a lot of the, I guess, of the radical thinkers for the Civil Rights Movement came out of New York.  You had Ella Baker.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you know her here in New York?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't know her, but New York has its share in everything as it has its share in the Super Bowl.
Speaker 1: I know Bayard Rustin came out of New York and he was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, he did.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: A. Philip Randolph came out of New York City.  In fact, he lived two doors from where I live presently, and when he organized that Pullman porters union [Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters], my father [Dred Montgomery] was a member of that union.  He was a fireman on the Southern railroad [Southern Railway] back in the '30s [1930s] and the late '20s [1920s], and I shall never forget this experience.  He was called to a convention in Washington, D.C. by A. Philip Randolph and the union, and they told him to bring with him the clothing that he worked in because my father as a fireman in the Southern railroad worked in overalls and that railroad cap and red handkerchief around his ne- neck, you know, from sweating and that kind of thing.  Well, he packed these things away and took off to the convention.  We never saw it in the pictures.  Now, this was back in the '30s [1930s], I suppose, forgot what year, but in the '30s [1930s], and I came to New York and in 2002, I believe, I walked into Schomburg library [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] and went into the bookstore and on the wall was a picture of my father with A. Philip Randolph in those overhauls that we helped him to pack but never saw in the pictures.  Of course, I was excited and told everybody, "Here is my father.  This is my father," and that was, as I said a moment ago, a very exciting time to see my father with A. Philip Randolph.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 577062
Speaker 1: Now, I mentioned Ella Baker, Bayard Rustin, but there was a lot--Bob Moses [Robert Parris Moses], as a young man, came out of New- New York [New York] too, to go south--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to work with SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee].  He was the, you know, I guess the leader of SNCC at one point.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He was with SNCC as SNCC had an impact on that movement down there.  The young people had enthusiasm, and they did a wonderful job.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So 196- tell us about--now, what organization were you working with here in New York, in terms of civil rights?  Were you associated with CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] or SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] or--
Speaker 2: No, I was a loner.  I worked through the church, Mother A.M.E. Zion Church [Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, New York, New York] who sent donation to the movement down there, and that was my connection with the movement through Mother Zion Church.
Speaker 1: So when you attended the march, I know the people around the country, you know, had formed groups to rent buses and that sort of thing; did you go down with a group from New York?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You see, this was my second time in Selma [Alabama] on a protest march.  The first time--
Speaker 1: No.  No, I'm sorry, I was talking about the March on Washington in '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: Oh, on, on, on Washington [D.C.]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: Yes, I was with a union, at that time, the Union 237 [Local 237, International Brotherhood of Teamsters], or something like that, I was with when we went down to that March on Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And what was your experience at the March on Washington and your impressions of what was going on?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, it was a--dynamite.  The first time I had ever seen 250,000 people gather into one spot, and I was blessed enough to work my way within fifty feet of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] when he delivered that I Have a Dream speech.  And, wow, something that you could never forget.  Never forget.  The people involved and the spirit of the march, and we left that Mall [National Mall, Washington, D.C.] clean.  After we finished, we didn't throw away any papers down, we--if we threw any papers down, we picked it up.  And this was a great incentive to everyone, and it's changed their whole complex or the political system in the United States.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  When I hear the timbre of your voice, I'm reminded of the television coverage of the march; I was thirteen watching it at home.
Speaker 2: Will you speak a little louder?  I--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.  I was thirteen when I saw it at home on TV.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: CBS, I guess, was covering it, Walter Cronkite and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --as the people were receding, they were singing 'We Shall Overcome' you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and a man with a voice like yours was going (singing), "Deep in my heart."
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: You know, so it was a--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  I always wanted to sing and never could, even after taking voice lesson, I could not sing, but I always appreciated singing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, had you ever met--I know they announced at the march that Dr. Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] passed away, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  And he was a champion of it all.  We were so sorry that he left the United States and didn't see this major movement happening and, of course, it was his dream to see the breakdown of segregation and discrimination.  He lived for this moment.  As an intellectual, he lived for this moment and didn't see it.  He went to the mountaintop and saw, but he didn't experience that march or many of the other dynamic movements led by King and Mal- Malcolm X and others.
Story_ID: 577063
Speaker 1: I just want to go back.  In the previous session, I know you mentioned going to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] to study economics and you had--you were interested in working in the state department [U.S. Department of State] or the UN [United Nations] at one point.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Were you inspired by Ralph Bunche and Channing Tobias [Channing H. Tobias] and some of the other people?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Ralph Bunche was an inspiration to all of us, and I went there--I looked at him as my inspire- one of my inspirers.  He did it and so can I.  I did that after I went to Selma [Alabama] for the first time.  See, when I finished Livingstone College [Salisbury, North Carolina] in 1949, I majored in religion, because everyone was telling me that I should go in the ministry.  My minister, at that time, told me that God had called--had told him to come to me and go into the ministry.  So when I went to Livingstone, I majored in religion to have that background, but as I finished Livingstone in 1949--you see, I finished Livingstone in 1949, and went back in '50 [1950] to get this economic major.  But as I studied religion at Livingstone College and in 1949, I heard a voice that I shared with Dean Satterwhite [John H. Satterwhite], and the voice said, "When the laws of the state conflict with the conscience of man, the laws of the state should be peacefully broken.  You are to go to Selma, Alabama and break the segregated law and don't fight back.  Sit and accept anything that happen to you."  Of course, I wouldn't share this experience not even with my friend because you hear voices, something must be wrong with you.  But it wasn't a voice as a voice coming out of heaven, it was a major thought, and it came to me as a voice and that's when Dean Satterwhite came into real play in my life.  I discussed it with him and he told me, "Look, Dabney [HistoryMaker Dabney N. Montgomery], if you follow that voice, you may be killed. But if you are killed, you will die for something greater than life itself."  And I told him how I had been led to go back to Selma and just break the law and accept whatever happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you go back and break the law?
Speaker 2: Yes, after I did a lot of things.  I ran, because I had fear; I'll be frank with you, I had fear.  I knew the condition of Selma, the racial condition of Selma.  I was born and raised there.  So it was at this point that I decided to go and get a major in economics.
Speaker 1: Now, now, what--now before we go there--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --I just wanted to find out what you did and what you had to run from; what happened in Selma?
Speaker 2: All this is in the part of my running.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I decided to get this major in economics and then get a master's [degree] at a university--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in economics.
Speaker 1: But did I miss you going back to Selma and breaking the law?  Did you go back and break a law before that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I'm coming to that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: I'm coming to that.  I decided to go to the University of Michigan instead of going back breaking the law, I said that I would major in economic international affairs and then by 1958, get a Ph.D. in economics or international affair, then at this time, I would go into the state department or the United Nation following a man like Bunche and make a contribution to the nation through that channel.
Story_ID: 577064
Speaker 1: I went to--back to Livingstone [Livingstone College, Salisbury, North Carolina] and got the thirty hours credit in economic and fifty when I left.  Then I went to University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  And when I enrolled there, I fell flat on my face.
Speaker 2: What happened?
Speaker 1: It just didn't work.  It wasn't for me to do, but when I fail at something that I really wanted, I said one failure will not break, I'm gonna have to fail two time before I accept it.  So when I failed at Livingstone Coll- at, at University of Michigan, I saw the whole dream of my life coming apart and at two o'clock in the morning, I start crying.  I couldn't sleep.  Crying, because I saw my life and what I was trying to do falling apart.
Speaker 2: Well, what happened there?  What did they--I mean, how did they treat at the University of Michigan?  Were there other black (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Just like another student.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: No problem.  No problem.  And as I was crying at two o'clock in the morning after my failure, I had a radio at my bedside and for some reason, my hand had went to the radio and I turned it on and I kept the radio on a religious sta- station all the time, and as I lay there crying, a hymn came on, "Be still my soul; the Lord is on thy side" ['Be Still, My Soul'].  And I often sang--hum that hymn, and I stopped crying and went to sleep and said I'm going to try this again at Wayne University [Wayne State University] in Detroit, Michigan.  And that's what I did.  When I left University of Michigan, I went to Wayne University in Detroit.
Speaker 2: Wayne State, right.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Majored in economics and again, I fail; this is not for you.  So since I had tried the second time in economics and failed, I dec- decided to change my whole lifestyle.
Story_ID: 577065
Speaker 1: I'll go back to Selma [Alabama] and possibly teach in the high school there.  I could teach social studies, but Selma does not have any classical ballet anywhere.  I'll go and study ballet and go back to Selma and instead of breaking a law, I'll take ballet, teach social studies and teach ballet to the high school students, any high school student who wanted or who signed up for ballet would be exempted from the physical education department.
Speaker 2: Now, when did you first become interested in ballet?  That seems like kind of an odd, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I became interested in ballet--I cannot tell you the day or the time, but this came to me as a way out of what the voice said do.  Look, go and take economics and make a contribution on that level.  I had failed.  Then go and study ballet and take it back to Selma, and you'll be offering something classical.
Speaker 2: Now, did you know any people involved in dance at that time?
Speaker 1: No, I didn't know any people involved in dance.
Speaker 2: And were you known as a good dancer?
Speaker 1: My father [Dred Montgomery] never allowed us to dance.  My father, a Baptist, real hardcore Baptist person, had two rules in the house, "There will be no dancing and no card playing in this house."  And he didn't allow any of us to not even pat our foot to music.  I had no rhythm at all coming up in a strict household of that nature and here I'm going into ballet, a very difficult operation--development without any background to dance.
Speaker 2: Now, that's--this is incredible because people that know dance would say that you'd have to be--you'd have to start as a kid to--
Speaker 1: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) really be a proper dancer.
Speaker 1: Nine, ten years old is the ideal time to start in ballet.
Speaker 2: But here you were in your twenties.
Speaker 1: I was up in my twenties before I got the idea and when I got the idea, I went at it.  This is another escape route for me.  So I went to Boston [Massachusetts] and enrolled--I took Saturday classes at Boston Conservatory of Music [Boston Conservatory at Berklee, Boston, Massachusetts] in ballet.
Speaker 2: Now, how were you able to pay for all these classes?  Now, I know you had a G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] for some of it--
Speaker 1: I had a G.I. Bill and I worked on the side.  I worked in hotel where I could get a dinner free and taking ballet, you need a good meal once per day.  So I put four to five hours into ballet in Boston and I broke my left foot leaping.  That was another tragic moment (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, well before--how did you--how were you received in ballet classes in those days?  I mean--
Speaker 1: I was--
Speaker 2: --did people try to discourage you or did they say--
Speaker 1: No.  No one tried to discour- in fact, they encouraged me at Boston Conservatory.  They had--I talked it over with one of the teachers there what I had planned to do in Selma and she took extra time with me so that I could go back deep style and put this type of program into the program of the high school there and had no problem, racial problem, in Boston; none whatever.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: But that's where I broke my left foot on the post.
Speaker 2: Now, how far had you progressed when you broke your left foot?
Speaker 1: Well, I, I had progressed beyond the beginner stage, at the medium stage.  And when I broke the foot, I had a cast--I didn't have a cast, I went to the hospital and they put a cast on my left leg from my knee down, include my foot.
Story_ID: 577066
Speaker 1: And I decided something else.  Since this is not working out, maybe if I take a tour through North Africa and experience some achievement of black people, this will offset the voice of going back to Selma [Alabama] and breaking the law.  So I had them (unclear)--the doctor took the, the, the thing off my left leg, and I left the next week going through the tour of North Africa.
Speaker 2: Wow.  This is really--now, you were really going from thing to thing (laughter).
Speaker 1: I'm doing some strange things, yes, but running.
Speaker 2: Now, were you--how did you--what--did you have any influences, in terms of African history at all, at that time?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 1: I had taken a course in black history in the Lutheran school [Alabama Lutheran Academy; Concordia College Alabama, Selma, Alabama] when I was in the seventh grade and that turned me on, let me say, and I always appreciated the color black.  I always appreciated and never was ashamed to be called black--
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: --and this was back in the early '30s [1930s] and possibly the late '20s [1920s].
Speaker 2: Now, did you--were you influenced at all by the Garvey movement or the people that--
Speaker 1: The Garvey movement?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: No, I was not influenced by that movement at all because I'd say here you have 10 million black people in the United States, you cannot move this number of people to another continent.  I wasn't influenced by that movement at all.  I had said all the time that you had to stay here; the problem is in the United States and you had to deal with the problem in the United States.
Story_ID: 577067
Speaker 1: So North Africa, now this is in the year nineteen fifty (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen fifty-three [1953].
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-three [1953].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So where did you go in North Africa?
Speaker 2: Tunis [Tunisia], Morocco, Egypt.  I went, by the way, to an island, Majorca [Spain], in the Mediterranean Sea.  And--
Speaker 1: Now, this sounds like an expensive trip too.  Now, how did you manage to finance that?
Speaker 2: Well, I was always good at managing money; in fact, I never--my mother [Lula Anderson Montgomery] and father [Dred Montgomery] gave me no more than two dollars in my four years at college [Livingstone College, Salisbury, North Carolina].  I could manage money, no problem.  I was willing to work, and I managed my money. That's how I paid for that trip.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The trip cost me, I believe, in the neighborhood of fifteen hundred dollars.  And on this trip, I came upon the island of Majorca and--just off the coast of Spain.  And as I walked down the streets in Majorca and the city called Soller [Spain], S-O-L-L-E-R, I looked in a jewelry store and a young lady was sitting there and she looked at me at the same time on the sidewalk and our eyes caught, and I walked in and we started talking.  She could speak English.  And we became attached to each other.  I left her store after talking with her and went to the dance recital in the city of--in the middle of the city and she came there also and she came with her address, name and address, and I gave her my name and address and we started writing to each other.  Pepita [Maria Bonia (ph.)] is what I called her.  We became very close, and I asked her to marry me and she said she would.  Then I wrote to her father and asked him.  This was in late '53 [1953], early '54 [1954], I asked him would he give his daughter to me in marriage and he said, "No," because she was his only child and he was in the business of jewelry, and he wanted her to keep the business going when he leave.  And he wanted her to stay in the Spanish culture.  So, that was the end of that, I thought.  It was a sad, heartbreaking experience and she got married to a Spanish fellow, I think he was in the Navy and they had two children, and that was 1954, '55 [1955].
Story_ID: 577068
Speaker 1: Well, believe it or not, in the year--I don't recall the year, it was 2001, or something like that, my wife [Amelia Neely Montgomery] and I was in Spain and I had told her the story of Pepita [Maria Bonia (ph.)].  And she said, "Why don't you look her up?"  I said, "No, I have forgotten her family name, the address and all that kind of thing."  But when I--my wife and I returned to New York City [New York, New York], there was a letter in the mail from social security stating that this person, Pepita, would like to get in contact with me after fifty-one years, and that her address and her telephone number was listed below her name.  So my wife suggested that I call her.  "I'll call her sometime."  And it went on for a month or two, and then one night my wife dialed her number and gave me the telephone.  Now, remember, this is fifty-one years after that engagement broken.
Speaker 2: Now, with her dialing the number, you're covered now, so (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yes.  And my wife dialed the number and gave me the telephone and she answered the telephone.  And it's amazing, I remember her voice and never had spoken to--or--to her over twenty minutes in our whole experience, because we wrote each other every week.  And when I told her that my name was Dabney Montgomery [HistoryMaker Dabney N. Montgomery], she started crying and she cried and kind of screamed and she cried more.  And I was listening to all of this on the telephone.  Finally, she came back, said, "Excuse me, please.  This is a miracle, because I have been trying to get in contact with you and I went to the American embassy and told them that I wanted your children in my will, and this is how I made contact with them to make contact with you."  And her first question was, "Are you married?"  I said, "Yes, I'm married."  "Are you happily married?"  I said, "Yes, my wife is standing here.  Speak to her."  So she and my wife got on the telephone and they talked for a while.  And it was a very friendly kind of chat.  So that ended, I thought, and I do reception work at the church, and we have a lot of Europeans to visit Mother Zion [Mother Zion African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, New York, New York] and one Sunday, five people came in from Spain, four people sat in the back and one woman came down front and sat behind me.  Now, this was in 2005 or something like that, so fifty-one years after, and my wife said, "That's not her because if it was her, she would have identified herself."  So, we let it go.  I had to go to the bathroom and when I came out, the Spanish people had gone.
Story_ID: 577069
Speaker 1: She said--one day my wife said, that she will maybe knock on this door and identify herself.  And all at once in 2004, 2005, this person knocks on the door and my wife answers and she said that, "Are you Amelia [Amelia Neely Montgomery]?"  I am looking--because they had talked on the telephone, "I'm looking for Dabney Montgomery [HistoryMaker Dabney N. Montgomery]."  And my wife looked at her and said, "You are Pepita [Maria Bonia (ph.)]?"  She said, "How do you know?"  "Well, we talked on the telephone," and my wife has told me this story.  And she said, "I'm not here--Dabney is not here, he's out in town, but he'll be back soon and in the meantime, we'll go out and have lunch."  So they went out and had lunch, but while they were out, I came home and as I sat there, I saw my wife coming in with this lady, and instead of using the key and walking in, she rang the doorbell.  I said, "Why is she ringing the doorbell when she has a key in her hand?"  So I went and opened the door and my wife said, "Do you know this lady?"  "No, I don't know her."  "Have you ever seen her before?"  "No, I don't remember."  And she looked at me and said, "This is Pepita."  "What?  Pepita?"  So she ran into my arms and we hugged and she came in and she said that when she got married, her husband made her destroy all of my pictures and letters that I had written to her, and that she got a divorce from him after having two children.  And she said that, "My father died and as he died, he was calling your name.  He saw my marriage didn't work out, so he was calling your name and he was saying, my tie pin and my cufflinks," and he would call my name again.  And she said to her that meant he wanted me to have his tie pin and his cufflinks.  So she flew, after fifty-one years, to New York City [New York, New York] unannounced to bring the tie pin and the cufflinks and she said her husband, and I think I have said this before, made her destroy all of my pictures, all of my pictures of, of me and the letters that I had written.  She burned them up and kept the ashes, that's what she said.  And she said, "I must see Dabney because he changed my life."  And she was bringing the tie pin and the cufflinks eight thousand miles on a--she arrived here on a Saturday morning, she found me Saturday afternoon and she left Monday morning going back to Spain.
Speaker 2: That's a remarkable story.  I mean, I've never heard one like that.
Speaker 1: And it re- it was a story, but that was one thing that happened on that trip running across North Africa.
Story_ID: 577070
Speaker 1: But something else happened, was I went into Athens, Greece, after leaving the island [Majorca, Spain] and after leaving North Africa.  And we checked in a hotel, when I say, we, I was with a, a group of twenty-three Americans.  They were all Caucasian.  And they took us to the Acropolis [Athens, Greece], to the three thousand year old theater, open theater, and that night the Athens Symphony Orchestra and the Athens chorus [City of Athens Symphony Orchestra and Choir] was singing and playing Beethoven's '9th Symphony' ['Symphony No. 9,' Ludwig van Beethoven].  The place was sold out, but I got in and went up on the left side of the theater stage and sat on the rock and as they went into that full moment, the watch on my left arm jumped off my arm.  I was so spiritually emotion- emotional until the watch actually jumped off my arm and fell over there and before I picked it up.  I looked over my right shoulder, it was a night in August, 1953, in Athens, a full moon was to the back of us, the sky was clear, the orchestra and choir was sitting down to my right or left, and I looked over my right shoulder and I swear until this day that I saw a group of angels flying in that blue sky, and the angels was over my right shoulder.  I was so spiritual uplifted until I decided that I would make Beethoven '9th Symphony,' the fourth movement, the theme of going back to Selma [Alabama] and breaking the law and not fighting back.
Speaker 2: Now, what did these angels look like?
Speaker 1: Like angels that I had seen in painting.  They had on long robe and big wings and they were flying, kind of around in a circle.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Maybe they were there, maybe they were not, but I saw them and as you recall the '9th Symphony' and the fourth movement of Beethoven 'Symphony No. 9' is the hymn of joy ['Ode to Joy'].  And I'd say in spite of my failure in life, there was still joy in the world.
Speaker 2: Is that the one--
Speaker 1: They did it in German.
Speaker 2: Is that the one, (humming) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, that's it.  Yes.  "Joyful, joyful, we adore thee," yes.  I went back to New York--I mean, to Boston [Massachusetts], and looked up the work of that fourth movement of Beethoven's symphony, and it was the exact thing that I needed, that there was joy in the world, in spite of all the fear.
Story_ID: 577071
Speaker 1: --Let me ask you this.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, you haven't--we've talked about Majorca [Spain] and we've talked about Greece, but what happened in Africa?  Did you make any connection to any other African people in Africa?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  No, I didn't.
Speaker 1: Well, what happened?  There, there are some there, right?  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I remember one experience in Morocco.  Here I am standing there with twenty-three white American and the--and the tour guide came up to me and said, "Are you black American?"  And I said, "Yes, I'm black American."  Well, when he said that, some of my friend stepped back because that was offensive, they thought--
Speaker 1: Yeah, those were the--
Speaker 2: --to me.
Speaker 1: --days, not now.
Speaker 2: Those were the days--
Speaker 1: Days when--
Speaker 2: --when they called people black.
Speaker 1: That's right.  If you called a--
Speaker 2: You--that meant a fight.
Speaker 1: --a Negro in those days black--
Speaker 2: Ooh, a Negro a colored.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Negro colored.  If you called them black--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --it was a fight.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I told them, "Yes, I am a black American."  And there was sigh of relief that went through their faces.  And he called me--one of my close friends on that tour called me way after that and said, "If he had called some of my Negro friends in California black, they would've gone on his head."  I said, "God made me black, just like he made you whatever color you are, and I'm just proud of my color as you are yours.  All the segregation and discrimination that we see, you set that up.  God had nothing to do with it."
Speaker 1: Now, did you see people that looked like you in North Africa (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes.  Yes, many people looked like me throughout Africa.  In fact, in Egypt, people would come up to me and ask for direction.  I know they were ask- asking for direction because they would point their finger at a cer- in a certain direction, and I would say, "I don't speak--I speak only English."  They would look at me and say, "You're a phony," or something like that.  "You are an Egyptian, we look just alike."  In fact, as I walked down the street in Cairo [Egypt], it looked just like Harlem [New York, New York].  All of these people that I'm looking at and, of course, as I say, they thought I was Egyptian in many cases.
Speaker 1: Now, you were there before the forming of the United Arab Republic, right, before Nasser [Gamal Abdel Nasser] took over?
Speaker 2: Right, in 1953.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, 1953.  And there I came back to the United States and went back to Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My foot was healed, and I started dancing again.
Story_ID: 577072
Speaker 1: And then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, just one more question.  This may seem off the wall, but were you aware of the movie that Paul Robeson made in North Africa, 'Jericho,' at the time?
Speaker 1: I was aware that he visited there, yes--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a movie called 'Jericho.'
Speaker 1: --but I didn't know the detail of it.  But when I went back to Boston [Massachusetts], my godmother told me one day, "I want to invite you over to my house for dinner and meet my other godson."
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, who was your godmother?
Speaker 1: Oh, her name has slipped me, but she was from Atlanta, Georgia, and she had a daughter who was a student at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] in the School of Social Work, and she was there with her daughter.  So she gave me her address and I went over to the house that Sunday on my bicycle and walked in a little late.  And when I walked in she said, "I want you to meet my other godson and his fiancee, Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and Coretta Scott [Coretta Scott King]."  And it was a long afternoon of--and evening of eating and talking, and that was when I met Martin Luther King for the first time.
Speaker 2: Well, what was your impression of him when you met him?
Speaker 1: Terrific young man, serious.  He drove a Chevy [Chevrolet], a two door Chevy, in those days and, of course, many of us going to college and grad school could not afford a car, but he had one.  And very inspiring young man.  You could see that something was in the works for him down the road, and he was working on a Ph.D. at that time--
Speaker 2: At Boston U--
Speaker 1: --at Boston University.  So I received an invitation to the wedding, and if I had of known that he was, was going to be famous, I would've kept that invitation (laughter), but I let it go, as another friend of mine getting married.  But that was when I met Coretta Scott, at that time, they got married later on after I had met them.  And she was an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] Zion person, by the way.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: A very faithful person in the A.M.E. Zion Church and she was born and reared only thirty miles from Selma, Alabama, my home, so we knew a lot of the same people being in the same denomination.  And they got married there in Marion, Marion, Alabama and they lived happily ever after, but a lot of pain.  They--when she married him, she said that, "I saw that I was not only marrying him, but I was marrying a cause; a husband and a cause."  Amazing when Mrs. Parks [Rosa Parks], that night, refused to move and was arrested, in the back of her mind was the law of the state conflict the conscience of man and the law of the state should be peacefully broke; she lived that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And when I saw that I said, wow.  That's on the table.  I need not go to Selma because in Selma, segregation and the discrimination was in full force.
Story_ID: 577073
Speaker 1: So I decided to come to New York [New York] and enroll in the Ballet School of Metropolitan Opera [Metropolitan Opera Ballet School, New York, New York].  And here, I dislocated my spine, a disc in my spine.
Speaker 2: Anyways, so--
Speaker 1: That was the end.
Speaker 2: --this sounds like taking up ballet, at your age, was probably a very rigorous--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  It's a terrific strain on the entire body.  A ballet dancer is the greatest athlete walking, and you have to control every muscle, every muscle and every part of the body to be the good ballet dancer, and you've got to work at it.  So when I dislocated a disc in my spine, this was the end of my ballet.
Speaker 2: So did you ever perform though with the--
Speaker 1: Did I ever--?
Speaker 2: --opera?
Speaker 1: No, I didn't.  No, I didn't.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No, I didn't.  However, I decided that, at this point, I must go to Selma [Alabama], break the law and do nothing.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So did you--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --did you go?  Okay.  So this would be 1950-what?
Speaker 1: You know, I have forgot the year; it was in the high '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: And was this before Montgomery boycott [Montgomery Bus Boycott] or--
Speaker 1: Oh, this was during the Montgomery because--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --when the Montgomery boycott broke and the student sit-in, I'd say to myself, "The thing that the voice told me to do has been put on the table and people were doing it.  I need not go."
Speaker 2: Now, did you--
Speaker 1: But I still had that push and urge to go.
Speaker 2: Yeah, when--I didn't ask you at the time, but when you met Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and sat down and had dinner with he and his, his future wife [Coretta Scott King], did you all discuss dur- nonviolent direct action at all?
Speaker 1: No, we didn't.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No, we, we never discussed, as I recall, nonviolent action.  We never discussed that.  So as I--
Speaker 2: And were you aware at the time of--very aware of what Gandhi [Mahatma Gandhi] was doing in India and--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: I was--what shall I--not a disciple, but an admirer of Gandhi, and I cannot tell you today where I got that statement from, "When the law of the state conflict with the conscience of man, the law of the state should be peaceful--."  I don't--I picked it up somewhere, I don't know where--
Speaker 2: I know----
Speaker 1: --but I read a lot of religion books.
Speaker 2: Well, what I read about CORE, the founders of CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] were, were also--I mean, James Farmer and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, James Farmer was a believer in that nonviolent, yes.  Yes.  And I was saying to myself, "What I have to offer is already on the table.  People are doing it."  But the voice said, "Go back."  So here I am in New York City with this weight on me, the only thing I can do to get it off.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you went back to Selma, it was about--
Speaker 1: I went back to Selma--
Speaker 2: --fifty--'55 [1955] or so?
Speaker 1: --alone.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Went in there one night.
Speaker 2: Now, where?
Speaker 1: And didn't tell my mother [Lula Anderson Montgomery] and father [Dred Montgomery] that I was in town.  I went into Selma one night, went--I knew I couldn't go home because my father, an old man, an old black man, deep in the tradition of the Deep South said, "This will not happen here.  Nothing will change here," and here I'm going with a radical idea.  I didn't go home when I got in Selma, I went to my Sunday school teacher's home and told her why I was there.  Now, Dean Satterwhite [John H. Satterwhite] had advised me, "Don't just go and break a law, tell a group of people what you are doing and then go and break the law."
Story_ID: 577074
Speaker 1: Now, when I arrived in Selma [Alabama], I went to my old Sunday school teacher's home and told her what I had planned to do and she became excited.  "No.  No, they'll kill you."  And she said, "You can't stay here.  Go down to the motel and stay the night there."  So that's where I went.
Speaker 2: Well, she was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Called a taxi.
Speaker 2: --she was afraid too, I suppose?
Speaker 1: She was afraid.
Speaker 2: If you did something while you were staying with her, then--
Speaker 1: Yeah, she was afraid that something will happen to you.  And she sent me--she called a taxi, and I went down to this motel in the bottom of Selma.  And I knocked on the door when I got out of the taxi, and the taxi took off.  It was about eleven o'clock at night and in those little towns, everybody go to bed at 9:30 and roll up the sidewalk, and here I am eleven o'clock knocking on the door.  And the owner of the motel came to the door, and she said, "I have no room.  All of my rooms are rented."  "You have no room?  But I have nowhere to stay."  "I'm sorry, I have no room."  And she closed the door.  And here I am only ten blocks from where I was born and reared, and I knew this lady and if she had looked at me the second time, she would've recognized me.  Here I am there at eleven o'clock at night, no room but a suitcase.  I went out in front of the motel under a streetlight.  In Selma, they have a streetlight every three blocks.  Nothing is movement--moving.  My suitcase by my right foot and leg, and I'm standing under this light and no place to go.  So this lady looked out of her window and said, "Mister, come back in.  I'm going to give you my front room.  If anyone leaves from here, then I'm going to transfer you out to one of the rooms in the motel."  And, of course, I said, "Thank you, Lord."  I went in the house, she put me in her front room and somebody moved out after I was there only a few minutes, and she moved me over into the motel.  I hadn't had anything to eat, and my whole program was to fast before I went to make the statement.  Now, as I settled down in this room, I heard voices coming out, people talking to one another on the outside of my room, and I recognized several of these voices.  I must admit, it was one of those motel that you could rent a room for two hours (laughter).  I recognized several voices coming out and I dared not look out of the window make my presence known and the night went through and the next morning came.
Story_ID: 577075
Speaker 1: I still hadn't anything to eat, and I fast the whole day and near sunset I said, "I'll check out and go to this church, Clinton Chapel A.M.E. Zion Church on Green Street [Selma, Alabama]."  So I went and checked out Sunday afternoon late, and the problem is, how are you gonna get in the pulpit in front of the people at church that night and tell them what you are going to do?  I had written this statement for eight pages of what I was to read.  I had gone to Bishop Walls [William J. Walls], who lived in Yonkers [New York] at the time and he approved what I was to say.  Bishop Walls was a historian of the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] Zion church.  He lived in Yonkers, at that time, and he gave me a letter and on this letter he stated, "Let Mr. Dabney Montgomery [HistoryMaker Dabney N. Montgomery] read this statement.  I approve what he has on the statement."  And with his name on this letter, I was sure that I could hand this to the preacher, and he would let me read the statement.  So when I got to the church with my paper in my pocket, I got out of the taxi and I hadn't been home in a few years and I was born and raised in that church and people recognized me and they called me Dab, D-A-B.  "Where have you been?  We haven't seen you in years.  How long have you been in Selma [Alabama]?"  And a lady come up to me and said, "Look, the minister is not here.  Since you was a Sunday school teacher and a class leader here when you were a young man, why not bring us a message tonight?"  Yes," I said, "I'll bring the message."  We opened the worship service and we sang to him and had prayer and she said, "We are glad to have Dab back here tonight and he gonna bring the message."  I pulled the paper out of my pocket and started reading, "When the laws of the state conflict with the conscience of man, the laws of the state should be peacefully broken," and they caught on at once.  "No."  And I continued to read.  I had eight pages to read.  I said, "While we in the South are marching and closing out schools to see--keep black people out, the competitor in the Far East is grinding his youth to be the competitors of tomorrow.  And the next conflict will be a conflict of ideas and the competitor in the Far East has opened his eyes and will be our greatest competitor.  We should, at this moment in our history, create a department of education."  There was no department of education on cabinet level during those days.  "We should create this department of education and since the next conflict will be international with a competitor who is--has a larger population than we have, we should create a school of diplomacy on the level of West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York] and on the level of the Air Force Academy [United States Air Force Academy, Colorado] and on the level of the Naval Academy [United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland] where when the brightest minds in our nation would be members selected to come and study diplomacy.  They would be not only our future diplomats, but they could guide administration as to language and culture of the conflict that we're going into, a school of diplomacy."  And the people said, "No.  No.  No."  And I finished my statement and I said, "I am now going to break the law."
Story_ID: 577076
Speaker 1: I went to the bus station which was three blocks or more away from the church, Clinton Chapel A.M.E. Zion Church [Selma, Alabama].  It was closed, locked, I couldn't go in there, but there was a Carter drugstore [Carter Drug Co.] on Broad Street [Selma, Alabama] that a good number of young white men just hung out there and I said, "I'll go there and sit at the counter and ask for ice cream, a Coke [Coca-Cola] or something and wouldn't move."  I went there and they were closed.  Okay.  They're closed, I'll go to the jailhouse, the police headquarters, and that's where I went, to the police headquarters and asked to speak to the police in charge.  And he came out with two other police, and I told them, "Sir, my name is Dabney Montgomery [HistoryMaker Dabney N. Montgomery].  I had come here to break segregated laws because it's wrong and it is the will of God that these laws be erased."  And there was a fountain for white people only, for color peopled only, another fountain, I went and drank out of that fountain for white people only.  He stood right there and said, "This man must be crazy," (laughter).  "Take him out."  Two cops came, grabbed me by the arm and took me out.  I landed on the curb of the street at the jail.  That's all.  To show you how dangerous this was when the King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] movement came to Selma [Alabama], two white men ate at a black restaurant two blocks from that jail and both of them were shot, one was killed.
Speaker 2: Two--
Speaker 1: One died from the wound.  Two white men--
Speaker 2: Two white men ate at a black restaurant?
Speaker 1: At a black res--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Two black from that jail and one was killed, the other received the shots.  And I thought at the time that SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] was there.  I went to a SNCC movement when King movement was there and they said, "Look, never go out alone and break a segregated law (unclear) and never go at night if you're with a group of people, don't go at night."  And there I was at night and alone and the angels of the Lord protected me.  Well, as I sat on that curb, a black fellow in an automobile came by and said, "What are you doing out here, son?  You don't see people sitting on the curb at night, not in Selma.  What can I do for you?"  "You can take me home."  "Where you live?"  "Corner, corner of Green Street and 1st Avenue."  So he took me in his car home.  When we arrived in front of my house, I noticed a few cars parked out in front of the house and the lights on in the house.  All those people in the church had gone to my father's house and told them that Dab is in town breaking segregated laws (laughter).  I knocked on the door, my father [Dred Montgomery] came to the door, the old man.  "There he is."  He opened the door and fell on the knees.  They had told him about the experience.  "Son, whatever you do, don't do it again.  They'll come out and burn the house down; they might kill you, they might kill--we don't know what will happen.  Please, son," down on his knee.  I never had seen my father on his knees before and he was a fireman for forty years on the Southern railroad [Southern Railway].  Strong man.  And I listened to him, and the people all left and words got out that Dab was in town and he was mentally deranged, a little crazy.  My father get in a car and he goes up to the police office and tell them that my son is World War II [WWII] veteran and he is shell shocked.  He is in town now, don't pay him any attention because he's shell shocked.  The police went, "Yeah, that boy was up here.  We knew something was wrong with his brain."  That's why, for that reason, they didn't whatever they had planned to do.
Story_ID: 577077
Speaker 1: You know, when you hear these--when I hear these stories, I always wonder how many other stories are like this because, you know--
Speaker 2: Many.
Speaker 1: --people don't--I guess they always--they say, why did people take abuse for so long?  But I think that there were people that resisted all the way through.  But let me go forward then to 1965, and 1965, when, when--now, you were in New York City [New York, New York] when the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge [Selma, Alabama]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --led by Hosea Williams took place where, where the people were trapped by the state troopers and the cops?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes. You see--
Speaker 1: What did you--
Speaker 2: --I followed my father's advice and came back to New York and months after that, they attempted to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge.
Speaker 1: Now this is actually years after--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that, right?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: When they attempted to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge--
Speaker 1: This is 1965?
Speaker 2: Yes.  They were beaten, gassed and everything happened to them.
Speaker 1: So, did you find out on the news or did somebody call you--
Speaker 2: I was looking at it.  I had seen the news how the German killed the Jews and the announcers say that this would never happen in America and one moment after that, the news came on of my Edmund Pettus Bridge in my hometown and these cops beating these black people only because they wanted to vote.  And I said, "I'm going back and taste some of that gas."  And I packed my things and went back.  It's amazing that the headquarters of the King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] movement was only two blocks from Clinton Chapel A.M.E. Zion Church [Selma, Alabama] and that church, Brown Chapel Church [Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church, Selma, Alabama] became the headquarters of all the Civil Rights Movement and it was only two blocks from where the boys had told me to go in 1949.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you went back then, who did you--how did you get involved in the King--the march from Selma [Alabama] to Montgomery [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Again, I was with welfare and I told my director, that was on what, 8th Avenue and 30th Street, Amsterdam Welfare [Amsterdam Welfare Center, New York, New York], I told my director, "You know I'm from Selma," 'cause everybody was talking about that.  I went into my job the next morning, "Yes, I know you're from Selma and you're upset."  "I'm going back."  He said, "Are you going to be violent?"  I said, "No, but I'm going back and take part in that movement 'cause I've been there before."  Said, "You promise me that you're not going to take up a gun and go?"  "I'm going there with truth and that's all I need.  Truth and word of God."  He said, "Here's fifty dollars.  Go and we'll look after your, your timesheet, your sick leave and your vacation and you call me as often as you can to let me know where you are."
Speaker 1: Now, now who was your supervisor, at that time?
Speaker 2: My super--I have forgotten this lady's name, but she was a Jewish lady, director of Amsterdam Center.  She was a woman of Jewish descent and she understood what was going on.  And I caught a bus, went back to Selma again, without telling my mother and father [Dred Montgomery] that I was coming back.
Story_ID: 577078
Speaker 1: And now, at that time, the mood had gotten into Selma [Alabama], and you had thousands of people from all over United States there.  And I got there late at night again.  The sun was setting, I remember, and I saw two groups of people marching.  The police force had put a ring around Brown Chapel Church [Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church, Selma, Alabama] and nobody could get in or out.  And when I got there, the sun was setting and it was like the battlefield that I had experienced in Italy in World War II [WWII].  I went in with only the clothes that I was wearing and maybe one or two pairs of underwear in my small bag, and I joined a group marching.  I didn't know where they were going, but I joined them and there was a group over here marching.  Well, it turned out that the group that I joined was only a group to take the attention away from group number one that was going uptown to protest and that I had joined this group and the police had stopped everybody.  We couldn't break out of that ring.  And when I walked into Brown Chapel that night I said, "I know my father [Dred Montgomery] should know that I'm in town," and after service, I went and knocked on my father's door and when I knocked on the door, he came to the door and opened the door.  He stood back, "Son, I knew you were coming back down here and get in this mess," (laughter).  "Yes, father, this is war and I have come again, and the people who were calling me crazy before are now joining the march down there at Clinton Chapel--not at Clinton Chapel, but at Brown Chapel Church."  And I looked at some of my friends, I wanted to say, I told you so, but I didn't say that, I just joined the movement and volunteered.  They asked one night, "We're looking for volunteers to protect Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]," and I volunteered.  Went to the altar of the church at Brown Chapel and volunteered to be a bodyguard for Martin Luther King, because the judge [Frank Minis Johnson, Jr.] had made a decision that we could march from Selma [Alabama] to Montgomery [Alabama].  You see, they stopped that first march, then they went to court and they got permission from a judge to stage that march again.  And--
Speaker 2: I think a federal judge--
Speaker 1: The federal judge.
Speaker 2: --ruled, I think--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I joined that group and my father, an old man, the morning we took off from Brown Chapel marching to Montgomery, came down and he blessed the march.  He understood what was going on and he came down to see us off, and we started marching from Selma to Montgomery.
Story_ID: 577079
Speaker 1: So did you walk with the group around Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was to his right.  There, it was about twenty-five of us and we were scattered over the whole march to keep some people quiet who was marching and to try and protect if we saw--we were given an order, "If you see anybody with a gun, a knife, going in the direction of King, you are to go and take Martin Luther King's body and push him down to the ground and then fall on top of his body," that was our orders; to push him down and fall on top of his body and that's what we had pledged to do.  We didn't have to do it.  However, they did kill two people during that period.
Speaker 1: On the march [Selma to Montgomery March], two?
Speaker 2: On that march.  The--
Speaker 1: Two black people?
Speaker 2: No, they were white.
Speaker 1: Two whites?  Okay.
Speaker 2: It was the gentleman--the preacher from Boston [Massachusetts], Reeb, I believe, was in--
Speaker 1: Reeb.  Yeah, James Reeb.
Speaker 2: James Reeb.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And there was a, a woman who was taking food and if anyone got sick on the march, bring them back.  Mrs.--what's her name?
Speaker 1: Was that, was that a woman from Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Liuzzo, from Detroit area.
Speaker 1: Viola Liuzzo.
Speaker 2: Vi- Liuzzo--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --yes, that was her name.  While taking the food and others to the march, the people marching, one of the white fellas drove up parallel to her--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and just killed her.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: --there's a company of Klansmen [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] in the car--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that shot her, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And when we got into Montgomery [Alabama] from the distant march, wow, it was a glorious time, wonderful time.  I was tired, but happy; dirty, but clean, because I only had on the clothes that I wore.  What I did was, I would borrow clothes and I'd find a laundromat, borrow clothes to put on and take my clothes off and wash them and dry them and put them back on and continue the march.
Speaker 1: So you knew you had to travel light, wouldn't you?
Speaker 2: I knew I had to travel light--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --right, and I traveled light.  And we marched into, into Montgomery.  And this is a joke, they said the governor of Alabama, George Wallace, looked out of his window and it had to be at least forty thousand people in that march.  That march got bigger as we got closer to Montgomery, got bigger and when he looked out and saw all of these people coming to the capitol [Alabama State Capitol, Montgomery, Alabama] he said, "There's a lot of votes down there in those people."  (Laughter) And changed his position.  He had stood in the door to keep a black student out of the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama] and later on when black went there and was accepted there, a black girl was accepted as queen at one of the homecoming rallies, and he kissed that black girl (laughter).
Story_ID: 577080
Speaker 1: My sister taught his granddaughter, yes.
Speaker 2: So your sister was a schooltea- teacher?
Speaker 1: My sister was a schoolteacher.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And she was there.  She is ninety years old now, she was there when she was there on sick leave.  If they had of known she was in that march, they would've fired her in two hours, but she took sick leave off and got in the march.  She didn't march all the way to Montgomery [Alabama], she came to Selma [Alabama] to see us off and, wow, we laugh about that now, what a dramatic moment that was; in fact, she knew the white woman [Viola Liuzzo] that was killed.  I took a picture of her and my sister together and all the pictures that they showed in The New York Times and other newspa- papers were pictures of her when she was a teenager and I had one with her with her arms around my sister, Fairrow Belle [Fairrow Belle Montgomery Prewitt], doing the march, but I dare not take that picture to Time or any of the newspaper because if the sister--might've seen my sister there, they would've fired her.  I went to Time with that picture and they said, "I'll give you three hundred dollars.  No, you cannot leave out of this room with it and give it back to me.  I cannot negotiate with it because my sister is involved."
Speaker 2: Do you still have it?
Speaker 1: That picture is somewhere, I don't know where.  I might have it somewhere.
Speaker 2: It'd be worthwhile to find it.
Speaker 1: I've lost so much--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --yes.  It, it, it's somewhere around the house.
Speaker 2: And how do you spell your sister's name?
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: How do you spell your sister's name?
Speaker 1: Fairrow Belle--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Prewitt.  Fairrow Belle Montgomery Prewitt.
Speaker 2: How do you spell Fairrow Belle?
Speaker 1: F-A-I-R-R-O-W
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Belle.
Story_ID: 577081
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you about some of the dynamics of the march [Selma to Montgomery March].  Now you were on security, right--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --with Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]?  You were pledged to protect him with your body if something happened.  But what were some of the dynamics of the different people around?  I mentioned, I think, during the break [HistoryMaker] Andrew Young, James Bevel [HistoryMaker Reverend James Bevel], Hosea Williams, [HistoryMaker] John Lewis and others, were they--I mean, what was the interaction around Dr. King?
Speaker 2: Yes.  You know,--
Speaker 1: C.T. Vivian [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. C.T. Vivian]--
Speaker 2: --Ralph Bunche was there also.
Speaker 1: Ralph Bunche?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ralph Bunche started off with him.  Now, there was a group who wanted to take the power away from King.  They wanted to go out and get guns or something and become violent and make decisions that Martin Luther King and his group, the Southern Christian Leadership [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] did not make, and we had to call a meeting one night and said, "Look, all of the policy will be made by King and his group, Southern Christian Leadership."
Speaker 1: Now, is it the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]?  Now, was it SNCC with Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] and who was it?
Speaker 2: Possibly so, because the march was getting so much publicity until anytime you get something going, somebody will come up and try to take it away from you (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was that the march where they called for black power?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  And--
Speaker 1: Do you remember what happened that day?
Speaker 2: Well, the, the meeting was in First Baptist Church [First Baptist Church of Selma, Selma, Alabama], which was down the street from Brown Chapel [Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church, Selma, Alabama] and the meeting was we are making the decision and the decision must be ours and it will be nonviolent.  If you disagree, then, you know, you don't belong here and that was it.  I actually will never forget when we was going up to have prayer on that courthouse step [Dallas County Courthouse, Selma, Alabama], of course, they would ride by and call us the N word and all those names and one morning we were going--it was raining and this man spit and that wind blew that stuff in my face.  So I wiped my face and continued to march 'cause I have faith and I'm on the side of the truth.  I feel sorry for you, you have nothing but a gun and spit and in spite of your attitude, I'm going and have prayer.  And I went--we went and had prayer on that--on those steps.  And then amazingly, and this is my victory, see, after World War II [WWII], I had gone to that same courthouse and asked to vote and they told me no.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I didn't have one thousand dollars' worth of land.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.  We got that story on the other--
Speaker 2: You got that story?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we got that story.  I was--yeah.
Speaker 2: And I went back in 1971 to look at--for my father's [Dred Montgomery] property and went down to the same registration room and a black woman was sitting at the desk with a white woman and told me I couldn't vote.  I said, "Do you deny anybody the right to vote?"  I was denied the right to vote right here in 19-what '46 [1946] and no, anybody who qualified, we sent them through and that was the revenge; not in hate, didn't hate the person sitting behind the desk, but I didn't like and I disagreed with her ideas and the ideas is what we wanted to change (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Speaker 2: --and we changed those ideas.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Story_ID: 577082
Speaker 1: Now, during the march [Selma to Montgomery March], was there ever a time when people wanted to turn back in '65 [1965] when you were going from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I--I--
Speaker 1: Was there ever a time?
Speaker 2: I never, never saw any of that.  People had so much enthusiasm over the march and we had a great deal of protection by the, the [U.S.] Army when they were fertilizing the National Guard, we had a lot of protection.  And there was helicopter flying low, they would scare the average person flying so low and I'm--I remember one landing on the--a few yards from where we were marching.  So all of that, what shall we call it?  Show of force prevented a lot of death because all along the 80 [U.S. Route 80] going to Montgomery [Alabama], there were big signs on billboards, "Kill Martin Luther King, the Communist," and they didn't know what communi- they couldn't spell Communist; they didn't--they couldn't define it and yet, you're Communist because you disagree with me and my segregation.
Speaker 1: Now, being on security detail, were you aware of the Deacons of Defense [Deacons for Defense and Justice] at all, in those days?  The Deacons of Defense, were you aware of them?
Speaker 2: The Deacons of--
Speaker 1: Defense, yeah.
Speaker 2: --Defense?  Yeah.  Well, we were only--we said everything we had did had to be nonviolent, not only in body movement, but in mind, attitude, that way, nonviolent start in the attitude.  And it's, it's, it's, it's, it shaped the body and the tongue and the speech, et cetera, but we were told that everything we did, for example, there were some people who had just joined the march who came from the North or somewhere, and just started yelling back at the white people who were here.  No, no, no.  No, we're nonviolent and we're going to--we're marching for a cause and we're going to a point and we're marching there.  And he's yelling and calling us names; he has no power now, he's losing.  You see, segregation was a power thing.  Many people kept segregation because it gave them power and now he's losing that power, so let him lose it.  He never should've had it in the first place.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But you don't have the man, you hate the idea.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you all had to explain that to some of the northern people?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes.  Yeah, a few--
Speaker 1: You were in a--
Speaker 2: --who yelled back.
Speaker 1: Now, you were in a unique position because you were--had lived many years in New York City [New York, New York], but you were from Selma [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: From that culture, Selma.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: You could see both sides, in some ways?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  And as I said, it was a very exciting time.
Speaker 1: Was it useful to have lived in New York to be able to talk to the northern people about how to, you know--
Speaker 2: Did--no, we would just tell them, "Look, you know, let's not cause any offensive situation wherein these people who live here will have to live through.  You're on the plane and the train the next day going back north, but these people will have to live here and live the problem.  Let's make it as smooth as possible."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They understood that very well.
Speaker 1: All right.  Were there--are there any stories about Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] or any of the--
Speaker 2: The--
Speaker 1: --principal people that you want to tell me before we got out of this story?
Speaker 2: And it's stories about him?
Speaker 1: Yeah, about Dr. King or [HistoryMaker] Andrew Young or any--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --of the people on the march that you--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, one day I decided to walk to the back of the march just to see did I recognize anyone.  And as I walked to the back of the march, there was my bishop in the march, Bishop Dunston [Alfred G. Dunston], one of the great preachers in America and he was my bishop, at that time; in fact, he was the pastor of Mother A.M.E. Zion Church [Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, New York, New York] at one time before he became bishop.  There he was in his--what, not clergy and gown, but out there sweating and walking with the people to Montgomery.  And, of course, we ran up to each other and hugged each other.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was a great--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --fellowship.
Speaker 1: It was good to see that people that--yeah.
Speaker 2: Good to see him, yes, yes.
Story_ID: 577083
Speaker 1: Well, when you went back to New York [New York], you--well you worked for the New York Housing Authority [New York City Housing Authority], New York City Housing?  Or did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I was working for welfare [Amsterdam Welfare Center, New York, New York]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I transferred over to housing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I retired from housing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there anything that you would do differently, if you could?
Speaker 2: No, I would go the same way and I would teach as I have taught kids, don't use the N word.  Don't call your precious women the B word.  Only two months ago, I would come out of my house on 136th Street, there was about twenty-five little Afro-American children going home and for some reason, the moment they got in front of my house, they started fighting and they were fighting.  And one fifteen year old boy took another fifteen year old boy and threw him down on the sidewalk and put a choke around his neck and here I am standing there.  I jumped down on the ground with him and broke that hold from around his neck and when the neighbors saw me on the ground, they came running themselves, telephone calling the police.  "Mr. Montgomery [HistoryMaker Dabney N. Montgomery], your high blood pressure's going up, you might have a heart attack," but I had to stop it.  You're not to use--you're not to fight each other, you're to love each other.  You're to share and love and read books.  All of this time you're out here fighting, get a book, read it, learn the system and then use the system when you're learning to get what you want.
Story_ID: 577084
Speaker 1: Now did--you mentioned reading, did you know Charles Seifert or John Henrik Clarke or any of the--
Speaker 2: John Henrik Clarke lived right in back of me.
Speaker 1: Did he?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes, he lived right in back of me.  Yes, yes.  Wonderful man.  He was what you call a self-made man.  He studied books and listened to lecture and that's how he got his Ph.D. that was never officially given to him, but the books he wrote and he had a professorship job at Hunter College [New York, New York].  And without any formal education, it's amazing how some of the forefathers survived in those days and kept going.  Booker T. Washington was another one, amazing what that man did and yet, there is a few young people that called him an Uncle Tom when they read about how he did things in his day.  For example, he told white people, "Look, I'm not trying to educate the black men mind, I'm trying to educate his hand."  That why he and Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] had the great falling out.  The--and the white people fell for that and gave him thousands of dollars to build Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee State Normal School; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] training young black people how to become ministers, how to become engineers, how to become mechanics, all of those areas.  You cannot train a man's hand without training his mind, but that was his way of getting money from white people and they fell for it.  "Oh, you don't have to worry about that, he's training their hand, he's not training their mind."
Speaker 1: Now, did you, did you ever hear Malcolm X speak?
Speaker 2: Oh, I heard him many times.  I was kissed by his youngest daughter last year, yes (laughter).  Yes.  He was my man, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you remember Lewis Michaux's [Lewis H. Michaux] bookstore [African National Memorial Bookstore, New York, New York] in the--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, sure, I remember that.  I remember that, before they tore it down and built the New York State building [Harlem State Office Building; Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building, New York, New York].  Yes.  Yes.  Yes (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 577085
Speaker 1: We shouldn't get out of this without asking you some stories about Harlem [New York, New York], I guess, in those days.  Harlem--how has Harlem changed since you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's an international community now.  At one time, when we moved in our house--when we first moved in the house, we never saw a yellow cab, never; never saw a yellow cab, now, they come one after the other.  You see, in those days it's, "Don't go to Harlem, you might be shot or robbed or anything."  But now, you see one after the other.  And, of course, when we first moved to Harlem--well, I've been in Harlem for fifty-one--since 1954, and it was in Harlem that you saw most of the black people, a white person every now and then.  Now, you see white people up there shopping and in and out of the yellow cabs and that kind of thing.  I moved into my block, it was seventeen empty houses in that block.  Now, all houses are filled with people and we have that must be--we must have at least five, five white person who had bought home because transportation is good.  Harlem is good.  And they hadn't discovered Harlem.  I have the A train two and a half blocks from me, the (unclear) on the other side of me or block and a half away, all kinds of bus transportation and the life is exciting, very exciting in Harlem.
Speaker 1: So are things better now in Harlem?
Speaker 2: Better?  Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Things always get better.  You have that faith and hope and you work to betterment of your environment and then get better.  You pray and work, don't just pray alone, you work and pray and things get better.
Story_ID: 577086
Speaker 1: Now, you are, from what I understand, you are the historian for the Mother--
Speaker 2: Mother A.M.E. Zion Church [Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, New York, New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) A.M.E. Zion Church now?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, this is the original church, right?  That was founded by James Varick back in the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --seventeen hundreds [1700s], right?
Speaker 2: Seventeen ninety-six [1796] it was founded.  Walked out of John Street Methodist Church [John Street United Methodist Church, New York, New York] because black people had to sit upstairs and the black people could not take part in the powers that make it of the church.  They were last to be baptized, the last to take sacrament and they could not be leaders in the church, so they walked out and started their own church in 1796, and rented a house for four years raising money to buy land to build a church of their own.  They called it Zion Chapel when they moved out and raised the money on Church [Street] and Leonard Street, they built this one room church and, of course, it was too small for all the problems that came into it.  It was the Underground Railroad coming in there and you had Harriet Tubman, you had Sojourner Truth, who was a member, changed her name inside of that church and you had Frederick Douglass who came and lived for fifteen days and got married there before they sent him up in Bedford [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And all of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And David Ruggles performed the ceremony for him, right?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: David Ruggles performed the ceremony--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So it was the beginning of--it was called, at that time, to the freedom church because the emphasis was on freedom; everything was on freedom and it had grown from that little one room church to a denomination that's all over the United States, all over Africa.  We have conferences in England and one conference in India.
Speaker 1: Do you think the members of the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] Zion church now, as well, I guess, as the A.M.E. church and the early black churches understand why their churches were formed?  I mean, do they still have the same spirit and understanding?
Speaker 2: Well, we have--that's what we teach, why you were formed and don't forget your history.  Yes.  Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And we have to teach it to the youth again and again and again, because they forget who they are because they've never been told.  They don't know who they are.  Like the little boys fighting, they don't know who they are and using the N word.  No, you're not that.
Story_ID: 577087
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Hope and concern for the black community?  I think we need, at this point in our development, management of money.  Now, many of us has come from nothing to up there, but on 125th Street, there are only a few black stores and this is a main artery running through the black neighborhood [Harlem, New York, New York].  We need the management of money.  We need more of investment and this is coming; it's coming, it's on its way.  So we are coming in, into that area of management of money that will control and give us more power and this is what, I believe, is our great need.  Well, we, as a group of people, we make more money than, than Canada.  All we need to do is channel it into the right places and get it here, control it and we can do miracle, much more than we are doing.
Story_ID: 577088
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: What is that?
Speaker 1: I said when you look back over your life and all the things that you've accomplished, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Oh, do I have one (laughter)?  I have done the best that I could with what I had, but I regret that I didn't go and break that law in 1949, 'cause I wouldn't be here talking to you now; maybe yes and maybe no.  But I lost a great deal of my young life in running from that voice of conscience and everybody has a voice of conscious--conscience and I missed out on what, about ten years of running.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, at the time, it seems as though you tried, but the time wasn't--it wasn't the right time, when you tried.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Though it's never too late to try, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It's never the wrong time--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to try, but--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --at the time, you were at night and by yourself, (laughter) and so it just.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 577089
Speaker 1: Tell us about your family; what can you tell us about your family?
Speaker 2: Oh, my father [Dred Montgomery], the railroad fireman.
Speaker 1: No, I don't mean that.  You probably told that in the beginning, but tell us about your wife and your child- do you have any children?  Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, I have a lovely wife, Amelia Ann Neely Montgomery [Amelia Neely Montgomery].  She was my reason for being active in the Tuskegee Airmen [Tuskegee Airmen, Inc.].  When she admired me, she didn't know I was a Tuskegee Airman because I didn't talk about it.  And one night we were looking at a story on the Tuskegee Airmen, I said, "Would you believe that I fed and clothed all of those men?"  She said, "What?  Why don't you join?  Get active in the unit."
Speaker 1: You mean, you were watching the movie ['The Tuskegee Airmen'] they made--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --about the Tuskegee Airmen, the one made in the '90s [1990s] with Laurence Fishburne and--
Speaker 2: Right, that one.  That one.  That one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, we were watching it together.
Speaker 1: And you had never talked about it?
Speaker 2: I had never talked about it; never talked about it.  And when I told her that my outfit [1051st Quartermaster Service Group Aviation Company] fed and clothed those men, she said, "Get active in it.  Go out and find a chapter somewhere and become active."  And she pushed me into becoming active.  Now I am what, a chaplain in the Govan chapter of the, of the Tuskegee Airmen, Claude Govan Chapter, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut [Claude B. Govan Tri-State Chapter].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there's a few of us still alive, all of us up in our eighties, eighty-four and up.  I'll be eighty-five in April.  A lady looked at me on the subway with this cap, she said, "Are you original Tuskegee Airmen?"  "Yes."  She said, "You must be eighty-four or eighty-five."  "You're right, miss, I am eighty-four."  Whew.  But it has been a great deal of, of joy to see people opening their eyes for what the Tuskegee Airmen has done.  When I was coming up on the elevator a few minutes ago, I stepped on the elevator and this woman stepped on behind me, a middle aged white woman and she looked at me, she said, "May I shake your hand?"  I said, "Of course."  "I want to thank you for what you did for the country."  "Thank you for thanking me."  I get this attitude all the time.
Story_ID: 577090
Speaker 1: Now, do you have any children?
Speaker 2: I don't have any blood children--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but I have about a thousand kids--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that I have dealt with since I've been in Harlem [New York, New York] on a one to one basis.  That's one of my daughters sitting over there behind the tables right. She doesn't know it, but she's one of my daughters.  I have all ages.  My first set of children, some of them are retired with grandchildren, or this was fifty years ago.  One thing that happened to me that I didn't mention when I came to New York [New York], I left the organized church because my life was failing.  I had been to Europe, to Africa, broken leg, that kind of thing, so I left the church, the organized--never left God, but the organized church.  But I realized one night I was working in Taft Hotel [The Michelangelo, New York, New York].  Taft Hotel was on 7th Avenue and 49th [sic.] and 50th Street; they've changed the name to some other name.  My job there, I was studying ballet [at the Metropolitan Opera Ballet School, New York, New York], was to repair broken beds and that kind of thing that happened, sweep the floor in the lobby and that's what I did to pay my tuition and ballet and other things.  And one night, it was 1953--no, '54 [1954], I had come to New York and hadn't joined a church.  It was a New Year's Eve night.  My job was from the ce- from the roof down to the basement and it was New Year's Eve night of '54 [1954] that I went up on the top of this building on the corner of Fif- 49th Street and 7th Avenue, Taft Hotel.  And as I went up on the top of this building something hit me to go back to the church and I decided to go back to the church.  And a roar from the crowd went up.  I thought they was cheering my decision, but I looked at the clock, it was twelve o'clock, they were roaring for the New Year (laughter) and I went and joined the Mother Zion [Mother Zion African Methodist Episcopal Church, New York, New York] in 1955.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And have been active there since.
Story_ID: 577091
Speaker 1: Are there any que- are there any questions that I haven't asked that we need to deal with before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: You're asking me did I have--and I told you I have about a thousand kids.  No, I think you've covered everything.  I--my lovely wife and her family, we blend in together very--I knew her mother before I knew her and her mother and I were very close friends and she came to church one night with Amelia [Amelia Neely Montgomery].  I said, "Who, who's that you got with you?"  "This is my daughter."  "Your daughter?"  "Yes."  "Let me speak to her."  And we became friends and eventually got married.
Story_ID: 577092
Speaker 1: Yeah, finish telling us the story about how you met your wife.  You said you--she--you met your wife in church?  You knew her mother and she came (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I met my wife in church.  Her mother and I were very close friends, but I didn't know she had Amelia [Amelia Neely Montgomery] until she brought her to church one night.  See, Amelia was going to another church out in Queens [New York].  They lived out in Queens, so she was going to a church out in Queens, a A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] Zion church in Queens and that night she decided to drive her mother over to church and when she drove her mother over, the two of them came in and I met them there at the door and I asked, "Who is that you have with you?"  And she said, "This is my daughter."  "Your daughter?"  "Yeah."  So we started talking and we became friends; we became friends before we came sweethearts and that was a very good move.  We had the same lifestyle and that's so important to young people getting married.  I don't care how much you think you are in love, do you have the same lifestyle?  And we had found the same lifestyle in the things that we did.  She liked football and tennis; I taught tennis for a good while at the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], and photography, and we did all these things together as a friend.  And then we fell in love and when I asked her to get married she didn't say yes or no, but I said, "October the 16th would be a good day," and she didn't disagree with that, so her mother and I got together and we set the marriage up; we, we set the wedding up.  And she said, "I promise you that I'll be at my wedding," (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, when did you get married? What year was that?
Speaker 2: Let's see, I asked her to marry me in Memorial--on Memorial Day and we got married in October, a few months later, October the 16th in 1971 and we have been together since then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 577093
Speaker 1: Now I'm eighty-five and I'm still walking; you know, many of my friends are in wheelchairs.  We had this meeting in Washington, D.C., many of them came back in wheelchairs.
Speaker 2: How many are in your group, in the chapter [Claude B. Govan Tri-State Chapter], the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut chapter?
Speaker 1: How many are in that chapter?  Let's see, I'll take a rough guess, I would say thirty-seven men--thirty-seven men and women because we accept young people to keep the name going and name and organization [Tuskegee Airmen, Inc.] going.  We accept young people and we have about three ladies, four ladies who are definite a part of our chapter.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The secretary of the chapter is a woman.
Speaker 2: All right.  And nationwide, about how many members of Tuskegee Airmen are there?
Speaker 1: Nationwide?  Well, they found three hundred of us still alive in March 19--I'm sorry, 2007, they found three hundred of us.  Now, it must have been three, three thousand of us during that period of World War II [WWII], forty--I joined them in '43 [1943] and '44 [1944] and '45 [1945], when we ended the war with the German, they broke us up.
Speaker 2: Now do you have any kind of formal relationship with the brothers that were in the 761st Tank Battalion, the Black Panthers?
Speaker 1: No, we don't have any connection with them, but we know them and they know us.  There was another very important organization, the Red Ball truck company--
Speaker 2: Red Ball Express, right?
Speaker 1: Yes, Red, Red Ball Express; terrific guys, did a terrific job.  And then is, of course, the Buffalo Soldier.
Story_ID: 577094
Speaker 1: My grand--great-grandfather was a Buffalo Soldier.  He--
Speaker 2: Where did he serve?  I'm sorry, I didn't--
Speaker 1: In Mississippi.
Speaker 2: In Mississippi?
Speaker 1: He joined--he left the South, escaped the South and went and joined a Union Army and his job, job in the Army was to guard a warehouse that contained gun powder and guns and that kind of thing.  And the story that is told to us in the '20s [1920s], around fireplaces, we had no TV, no radio in the '20s [1920s], my Aunt Hattie [Hattie Montgomery (ph.)] tell a story about the great-grandfather, Joe Montgomery.  Joe was working on guard duty protecting this warehouse of guns and gun powder and his orders was shoot any person who come in this area with a lighted cigarette, a cigar, a pipe in his mouth; those were the orders given to my great-grandfather, Joe.  Here come, of all person, General Grant [Ulysses S. Grant] smoking a cigar in Mississippi, walking near my great, great-grandfather's (unclear) and my Grandfather Joe told him to put the cigarette--cigar down and he paid him no attention.  He said, "Put the cigar out or down."  He paid him no attention.  "I'm telling you for the third time, if you don't put that cigar down, I'm bringing my rifle up to shoot," and he put the cigar down and congratulated him for being the good soldier.  Now that story was told to us by my forefathers around a fireplace and we tell that story to each generation.  I was looking at HBO about ten years ago, on the Civil War and there was General Grant in the State of Mississippi with a cigar in his mouth smoking it; I need no more proof, the story has been--the, the story is true.
Speaker 2: Now, you may have talked about that in the first reel, but what part of Mississippi was--
Speaker 1: I don't know what part of Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Or let me ask you this.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Is your family any way associated with Mound Bayou, Mississippi?
Speaker 1: No, we are not.
Speaker 2: 'Cause there's a Mound--I.T. Montgomery [Isaiah T. Montgomery] founded--was the founder--
Speaker 1: There was?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Founder of Mound Bayou.
Speaker 1: We--I, I don't know about it.  We may be and don't know because even the soldier there and--had that gun that--
Speaker 2: Do you know what part of Mississippi your--
Speaker 1: What part of Mississippi?  What--no, I don't, but it was in southern part of Mississippi--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and he gave that gun--let that gun--that rifle, my father [Dred Montgomery] had that rifle and in the 1960s, my father sold his rifle for ten dollars to a white man.  He didn't know the name of the white man he sold it to.  I went home a nonviolent, but that's a gun that I want is the rifle that Grandfather Joe used that you have on the back porch on the wall.  "I have sold that gun for ten dollars."  It's a museum piece; it's gone now.
Speaker 2: And it's more valuable with the story attached to it.
Speaker 1: With the--with--yes, with the story and with age, each year, it become more valuable.  Yeah, I'll never see the gun, but that was one gun that I wanted to own.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you said it was your Grandmother Hattie that told the story?
Speaker 1: Hattie, my, my, my Aunt Hattie.
Speaker 2: Aunt Hattie.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Aunt Hattie was a storyteller.  She would bat her eyes and she'd comb the hair to the back of her head and put a ball back there and she had long eyelashes and she could sit at the fireplace and tell a story and make you afraid to go to bed at night; better than TV, the best TV in the world (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  And this is down in Selma [Alabama], this is in Selma where she tells you that?
Speaker 1: This was in Selma, yes.  Selma, Mount Vernon, Alabama and Alberta, Alabama.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But Aunt Hattie was from Mount Vernon, Alabama.

Speaker 1: Anything else before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I think you've covered everything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered?  I would like to be remembered as a person who did the best he could with what he had, that possibly inspired a few people.  I think the inspiration is a major, major contribution to inspire people to go to another level; this is more important than anything.  I shall never forget I had a group of little girls, seventeen of them that I taught charm and how to sit and how to fill out application and how to respect older people and how to love themselves and others.  And one little girl said to me, this was years ago, "I'm going to rise above my welfare training.  I was born on welfare, and I was raised on welfare."  This young lady now, today, is an international lawyer in real estate in Los Angeles, California and Norma is my girl, one of my kids.
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Norma, Norma Williams.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I have others who have become Ph.D.'s.  Another kid in that class Ph.D., she's in Washington [D.C.] in the government.  Another young lady has been assistant attorney general in the State of Virginia.  Another one was in the first women class that graduated from Yale University [New Haven Connecticut].  And another in the social work dealing with people with drug problem.  Right now, that's what they're doing.  Another one is supervisor of teachers in New York City [New York, New York] and now you have it, they're doing great, doing great, and I'm proud of her because I believe that I had something to do with their success.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And this is the aim of my life to take a child to another level.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you for your story; it's really a great one and--
Speaker 2: Well, thank you for recording it (laughter), yes, indeed.  It has been a pleasure and let's hope that we can still inspire people in some way or the other.
Speaker 1: Oh, before we leave, I just have to identify the observers; I never did identify them.  Observing this interview are Neanda Salvaterra [ph.] and Amelia Montgomery [Montgomery's wife, Amelia Neely Montgomery], so thank you, sir.

Speaker 1: Mr. Montgomery [HistoryMaker Dabney N. Montgomery], could you explain this display that you have?
Speaker 2: Yes.  First, we have the heels of the shoes that I wore on that march from Selma [Alabama] to Montgomery [Alabama].  When I completed that march, I took the heels off my shoes and I said I'm going to keep these shoes as a symbol of this march.  And my necktie that I wore on that march, now, the necktie looks small now.  However, it was the average size in that when I would wash my clothes, I would take the necktie and put in the laundromat and dry--wash it and dry and it came down to the size that you see here.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's got of kind of a continental look.
Speaker 2: Yeah, contin- right, contin- we'll call it that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Now here is an address book that I had in the '50s [1950s].  Now, if you look at that closely, you'll see the address of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --in Atlanta [Georgia].  He guided my hand as I wrote his address in this book at that dinner that night that the godmother fixed for the two of us.  And here is a picture of the Edmund Pettus Bridge [Selma, Alabama].  I was born and raised only a few miles from this bridge and I saw them build this bridge from water level up.  And on Sunday afternoon, we would often cross this bridge and go to the other side and stand for a few moment and then go back.  When we stopped and stood for a moment or two is exactly why they beat up and gassed the people in that march to Montgomery.  So we had a spiritual inclination as a ten year old to march across the bridge for exercise, that's what we were doing, basically, and then go back home after we crossed the bridge and it was indeed, a wonderful experience.  That's it on this board that I have.  I keep all of these--I'm going to give this board to the church, Mother Zion [Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, New York, New York].  For some reason, they're building archives, and they have named the archive after me and I'm going to leave some of my things for the archives and this is what I'm--part of the thing that I'm going to leave in the archive.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So we'll have the Dabney Montgomery archives of the A.M.E. Zion church [Dabney N. Montgomery Art Gallery and Exhibition Hall]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yes.  Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: They named it that.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, thank you.
Speaker 2: Okay.
