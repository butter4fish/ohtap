Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Crockett. Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay was it named for him?
Speaker 2: Sir?
Speaker 1: Was it named for Davy Crockett?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what do you know about that side of the family? How far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: Not, not as far back as I should probably.  But I, I've got the whole genealogy in here somewhere.  But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I was given a copy of it I, I don't want you to try to go through the whole genealogy but is there a, is there a date that's the furthest date back that you can--and does it--can you trace 'em back to the 1830s or the 1700s--
Speaker 2: That, that book goes back--that's where I would have to go to get information.  And I can't tell you what's in it without reading it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So you, you have my permission to read the book and answer your own questions (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right.
Story_ID: 410914
Speaker 1: Is there any stories that has come down through your family about--that made an impression upon you about your family back in the 19th century?
Speaker 2: Not especially, you know, my dad [Andrew L. Jefferson, Sr.] was from a little town called Elysian Fields [Texas] outside of Marshall, Texas, that's deep East Texas.  And he was living and working in Dallas, Texas where my mother [Bertha Jefferson-Nathaniel] had gone from Crockett [Texas] to continue her education.  And they met, and got married, and I was born 1934 in that--in the City of Dallas is the reason--by reason of their union.  And I met, you know, lots of cousins, and grandfather, and step-grandmother on my mother's side, and grandfather, and I can't visualize grandmother on my daddy's side.  I can remember uncles, and cousins on my daddy's side.
Speaker 1: Is there an occupation that typifies what your family was doing, you know, early on?  Were they primarily teachers, businessmen, farmers (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, my dad was a carpenter, and a jack of all trades.  And my mother was pretty much a homemaker.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And no, neither one was college educated.  Although, my mother did attend Mary Allen college [Mary Allen Seminary; Mary Allen Junior College] in Crockett.  But she took typing there, but she didn't-- couldn't regard her as a college graduate.  My dad just did whatever it took to make a living.
Speaker 1: Okay, is he--you say he was born--well he was raised in Elysian?
Speaker 2: Elysian Fields, Texas.
Speaker 1: So primarily, like a farm community?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did, did your dad get a chance to go to high school?
Speaker 2: Probably, but my impression is that he didn't go very far.  It's something we didn't talk about.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was very intelligent but we didn't talk about how far he'd gone in college, I, I accepted that he was not a college graduate.
Story_ID: 410915
Speaker 1: Now, did your parents [Bertha Jefferson-Nathaniel and Andrew L. Jefferson, Sr.] talk about growing up, and what it was like for them and--
Speaker 2: In, in a measure of speaking, but there wasn't a whole lot to brag about.  You know, I spent the summers in Crockett [Texas] with my grandfather on my mother's side and, I--at a later age spent some time at Elysian Fields [Texas] visiting my kinfolks on my daddy's side. But--and hearing stories from my dad from time to time about his brothers, and sisters and his coming up.  But, none of them stick with me right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember hunting stories, and shooting stories and that sort of thing.  My dad was a great, great shot, and considered himself the greatest fishermen that ever lived.  Yeah, he, he was--his nickname was--I think it was Bud [ph.].  And he was the baby in his family.  But, but, I can't, I can't pull up a lot of old stories from him now.
Speaker 1: Any, any stories in your family about coming from some other place?  I know Texas was--I mean--looked--I glanced at your family tree and it seems like there's some origins in Georgia.  Someone traced your family all the way back to 1700s.  You know, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I--well, that's good but I can't do it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).  I have a sister-in-law who put that book together, and she did a good job of it but, but she's--I'm learning as I go along.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I've never before say this year, spent a lot of time on that history.
Speaker 1: Yes sir, Okay.  I just wondered if there was a tradition in the family about a story of how they got to Texas, and when they came (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.
Story_ID: 410916
Speaker 1: When you look at the personalities of your mother [Bertha Jefferson-Nathaniel] and your father [Andrew L. Jefferson, Sr.], who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My dad.  And my mother is ninety-five years old and I---my dad is deceased.  He died at seventy-four and I, I'd like to think I, I take--I'm going to take the longevity side from my mom.  I'm--I'll be seventy-three later this month.  And if I get past seventy-four then I've got a chance to match my mom's achievement.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She's in robust health and just an inspiration to all of us.
Story_ID: 410917
Speaker 1: Do you have any brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have one sister, I have two brothers, and one brother is deceased.  The two brothers [Jeffield Jefferson and Albert Jefferson] live here in Houston [Texas].  I'll have breakfast with one of 'em in the morning at ten o'clock.  I talked to him a minute ago.  His birthday was yesterday.  And another brother who also lives in Houston.  His birthday is September the 11--the 12th.  And I, I talk to him on a regular basis, he's a golfer, as we all are.  And my sister [Betty Jefferson] lives in Wharton [Texas], which is about fifty miles from here.
Story_ID: 410918
Speaker 1: Now, you were born in Dallas [Texas], but how long were you there before?
Speaker 2: I'm told that we moved from Dallas to Houston [Texas] when I was three.  So I didn't spend very long in Dallas.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there a reason why the family moved from Dallas to Houston?
Speaker 2: I don't know the answer.  I suspect to make a better living.  But, I don't know that to be true.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, so you, you grew up here in Houston, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what neighborhood did you grow up in?
Speaker 2: Essentially in Third Ward [Houston, Texas].  Although, we lived in the Fourth Ward, the Sixth for--Sixth Ward, the Fifth Ward, and the Third Ward.  But, I spent most of my time in Third Ward.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Some of the other wards you, you were discussing are wards and--I know that pe- people--the Houstonians that I've talked to, you know, mentioned the Third Ward, the Fifth Ward, and the Fourth Wards being the black wards primarily.  But, so you lived in some that weren't, you know, considered black wards.
Speaker 2: No, every ward I mentioned is--except for Sixth Ward is essentially a black neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Sixth Ward is kind of a mixed community.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a--so was there a partic- particular name for the neighborhood that you lived in, in the Third Ward? I mean the--the one you consider (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now when you say the Third Ward, that's--you said it all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, that's the neighborhood name?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 410919
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yes, I remember dropping my cap pistol from the back of somebody's car in my driveway, and it broke my heart, I remember that.  I swallowed a Mickey Mouse watch when I was about six years old.  That was a topic of much discussion (laughter).
Speaker 1: What ever happened to it (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I guess it passed (laughter).  Yeah, I remember those things.
Story_ID: 410920
Speaker 1: Now what was some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: In Houston [Texas]?  I suppose the chili dogs at Foster's [ph.].  The games at Batiste service station [ph.].  The fun with all the guys in, and around the service station.  Driving the Kelly's Drug Store truck as a young man.  And delivering drugs, prescriptions, all over Houston, with my buddies in the car with me singing my fraternity songs, and cutting up.  I once had a wreck on the corner of Pierce [Street] and Caroline [Street], when I had two of my buddies in the car with me.  That's an event we talk about even now.  We--just great, great stuff coming up with your buddies and growing up--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, planning the future.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Wanting to be somebody.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 410921
Speaker 1: Did you have any heroes when you were coming up, and people you looked up to, that you wanted to be like?
Speaker 2: I suppose so.  Although, I can't, you know, focus on any particular personalities.  I suppose I have always admired Frederick Douglass.  And of late of course, Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  But, in my youth I think Frederick Douglass was a source of inspiration.  Thurgood Marshall, of course as well.  And when I decided to go to the University of Texas law school [University of Texas at Austin School of Law, Austin, Texas], I think I was inspired by the efforts of Marshall, and Heman Sweatt [Heman Marion Sweatt], who was a mail carrier in the neighborhood where I grew up.  And we knew about his efforts to open the University of Texas.
Story_ID: 410922
Speaker 1: Was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: To some degree, but not to a great extent.  I can't-one, one of the people most influential in my life was my minister.  But, it was a Reverend John Moore [John D. Moore] as a person, more than as a member of the church.  He was my friend and he taught me photography.  I used his equipment on the weekend when I was a freelance photographer in my early days, in high school [Jack Yates High School, Houston, Texas], and in college [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas].  And I--one of my jobs was to clean the church on the weekends.  And another one of the things I did a good deal was to ride with him on the first Sundays, and visit the sick.  And we talked about life, and college, his own coming up, and I was kind of like an extension of his family.  He was, he was a good friend of mine (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What, what was a--okay.
Speaker 2: It was a congregational church--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I still belong to that same church.  I have been a member for over fifty years.
Speaker 1: Okay, what's the name of it?
Speaker 2: Pilgrim Congregational United Church of Christ [Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: I think it's one in Detroit [Michigan]--named the same name.  No, it's Plymouth [Plymouth United Church of Christ] in Detroit, that's right it's Plymouth I got the Pilgrim and the Plymouth mixed up.
Speaker 2: Well, the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, 1620 (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Absolutely, right.
Speaker 2: And those were Congregationalists and they just off shooting all over the country you see, the Plymouth, the Pilgrim.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the derivation of the name.
Story_ID: 410923
Speaker 1: We talked about school, and you mentioned Frederick Douglass, now where did you go to grade school, and did they talk about black history there?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well I'm sure I picked it up somewhere along the way.  I know that it wasn't emphasized as much then as it--I hope it's emphasized now.  But, I went to elementary school in the black community at Douglass [Frederick Douglass Elementary School, Houston, Texas], Blackshear [Blackshear Elementary School, Houston, Texas], and to Jack Yates High School [Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Now, is Douglass a separate school is that one--is it Douglass Blackshear?
Speaker 2: Douglass is one elementary school, Blackshear is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, was that named after Frederick, Frederick Douglass?
Speaker 2: I think so but, I'm not a 100 percent sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, is it two S's, two S's or one?
Speaker 2: It's in the phone book we can look it up.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm asking 'cause Frederick Douglass spelled his name with two S's.  Like Douglass and, 'Lady of the Lake' ['The Lady of the Lake'] by Sir Walter Scott.  That's why--what he--
Speaker 2: Maybe.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Blackshear?
Speaker 2: That's a separate school.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And Jack Yates High School (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well--okay.
Speaker 2: Which was both a junior and a senior at that time.  And of course Texas Southern undergraduate school [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay, now the reason why I was asking about the black history in schools, is that, is that a lot of people say they didn't get any black history in school.
Speaker 2: Well, I was history major--somewhere along the line I picked it up.
Speaker 1: So, it may have been in Texas Southern?
Speaker 2: Could've been.
Speaker 1: Okay, you don't remember knowing about Frederick Douglass when you were a little kid?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't know you were gonna ask me that question.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, it's all right (laughter).
Speaker 2: I'd've kept better notes if I'd known.
Speaker 1: It's all right, I'm just, you know, trying to find out 'cause it--you know, I think it's surprising that people didn't have any black history in school at all in those days.  You know, but, hardly anybody did.
Speaker 2: Well I--you know, at some point we, we, we knew all about the Underground Railroad, and Sojourner Truth, and Crispus Attucks and yeah, you picked it up somewhere.  I don't think it all came in college, some of it came though along the way.
Speaker 1: Yeah, did you ever have Negro History Week [Black History Month] in--when you were in grade school or high school?
Speaker 2: I can't remember-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --if we did.
Story_ID: 410924
Speaker 1: I remember we had good teachers at Yates [Jack Yates High School, Houston, Texas].  And I remember that clearly, I mean outstanding teachers.
Speaker 2: Who were some of the outstanding teachers there?
Speaker 1: We had Lullelia Harrison [Lullelia Walker Harrison] to start with.  I wanna give her credit, she's an English teacher.  She's still kicking, barely, but she's still kicking, rambunctious as ever.  Hazel Young [Hazel Hainsworth Young] was my Latin teacher.  Jerome B. Busby [ph.] was an English teacher, and a real cool cat.  We all looked up to him.  Mr. Fonzworth, taught chemistry, Mr. Kemper [ph.] taught biology, Jimmy Laws was a biology teacher as well.  And Whitlow Green [ph.], I think he, he taught history.  Andrew "Pat" Patterson [Andrew L. Patterson, Sr.] was a coach--and a men's coach and the women's coaches collaborated in our--must've been junior and senior year and made us all learn how to dance.  Wonderful experience.  Made the boys go to the girls gym (laughter) and taught us how to foxtrot, and the waltz, and great stuff.
Speaker 2: It's interesting that some of the same names as Coach Pat Patterson and Ms. Harrison, they keep popping up in the interviews, you know, here in Houston [Texas] so they must've been really good teachers (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well you see, those were the Third Ward [Houston, Texas] heroes.  You see, if you talk to somebody from Fifth Ward, for an example, Barbara Jordan was one of the products of the Fifth Ward community.  She and I, came together as freshman at Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas].  We started together in the same year and--
Speaker 2: She went to Phillis Wheatley [Phillis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas] right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you see that Phillis Wheatley is the Fifth Ward, Jack Yates is the Third Ward.  So when you talk to somebody from the Fifth Ward they've got a completely different people he--list of heroes.  But when--so we each had our own, you know, heroes.
Speaker 2: Now was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And we competed.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, one of the greatest football matchups of all time was the Yates, Wheatley football game on Thanksgiving Day.  And, we don't do it anymore, but we did for years and you'd dress up in your absolute best and you went to the--watch the football game between Yates and Wheatley.  I mean and it was just diehard.  I mean you would fight over it or, you know, over in behalf of your team.  It was just great stuff.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was that, that rivalry was just, just tremendous.
Story_ID: 410925
Speaker 1: Now was music a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Music? Not especially.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I always liked listening, and singing, and I can still carry a tune pretty good.  But I never--I, I started taking piano I think, and I thought it was for sissies.  And I just resisted that effort on a part of my mother [Bertha Jefferson-Nathaniel] to make me learn to play the piano.  And then, at some later point I was making noise with a saxophone.  Beautiful saxophone, nickel-plated.  Kind of an ugly carrying case but, I always wanted one of those canvas carrying cases like the real musicians had.  But mine was in an old box that they came in from the manufacturer.  And I, I never learned how to play that thing either.  But I sure wish now I knew how to play the piano.  I'd love to be able to play the piano.  But, it's an opportunity that I let pass me by.
Speaker 1: Now, what about movies--now there's--television really hadn't come out I guess when you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know, this--these were the days of, of segregated movie houses.  And--but, we were fortunate in Houston [Texas] and that we had our own--we had at least two movie houses in the Third Ward [Houston, Texas].  The Dowling [Dowling Theatre, Houston, Texas] and the Park  [Park Theatre, Houston, Texas] theaters.  You had at least one downtown theater, which was--catered to the African American community.  And you had at least on in the Fourth Ward, and you had at least on or maybe two in the Fifth Ward.  So, you had lots of, of movie houses where you could go see a movie.  For the--in 1949 I lived in Crockett [Texas].  This is the year my parents were divorced, and I went to live with my mother in Crockett.  And that was the year when I learned the--go to the picture show that was segregated.  Whites sat downstairs, and blacks sat upstairs.  And we had to go the movie by the side door and sit in the balcony, which I always thought was the best seat in the house.  But, we had to sit there, and there's stories told in which we were accused as young black students of throwing things down from the balcony to the downstairs to make our presence felt.
Speaker 1: But, that's not true is it?
Speaker 2: They're just stories (laughter).
Story_ID: 410926
Speaker 1: So, you were what, about twelve when your parents [Bertha Jefferson-Nathaniel and Andrew L. Jefferson, Sr.] divorced?
Speaker 2: Thirteen.
Speaker 1: Thirteen?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, did the whole family have to split up, did some--
Speaker 2: Yeah, all the kids went to Crockett [Texas], and I stayed there a single year.  And I'm told that I was so far ahead of the students in Crockett that somebody recommended that I might wanna come back to Houston [Texas], and I did, came back to Houston and stayed with my dad and finished up at Yates [Jack Yates High School, Houston, Texas].  And that's how I got back to Jack Yates.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And finished up at Yates in '52 [1952].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now were you considered a good student at Jack Yates?
Speaker 2: I was number 10 out of 254 students, so I think that's pretty good.
Speaker 1: That's pretty good.  Did, did you run for class office (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was, I was, probably class president in like junior year, vice, vice president, senior year, president of the honor society in one or both those years.  Yeah, I was a student leader.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 410927
Speaker 1: Well, did you have to work in school at all, you had to work?
Speaker 2: Yes, I've been working since I was fifteen.  And my first real job was as a clerk in a grocery store, George's Food Center [ph.] on the corner of Live Oak [Street] and Holman [Street].  Where I would, you know, run the cash register, and stock the shelves, and end of the day sit down with George and Mary Colinetta [ph.], and have dinner with them like the rest of the family and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Are these Italian people?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay, was that unusual then for you to be a clerk in a, a white owned store?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I don't know if it was unusual or not, it was what it was.
Speaker 1: Okay, I mean, I'm--
Speaker 2: It was like--I was like a member of the family, and of course the relationship continued until both of them died.  And I always get the call to come to the funerals, and other family events, and they considered me a friend.
Story_ID: 410928
Speaker 1: So when it came close to graduation time had you--was your path laid out for you, did you know you were going to Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas]?
Speaker 2: No, it was kind of an awkward situation as it developed.  Because, I'd had these conversations with my friend Reverend Moore [John D. Moore].  And I had--something he had said somewhere along the way that led me to believe he was gonna see to it that I went to Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut].  And I had no idea what the mechanics were, or could be for that arrangement.  But I had my heart set on that.   And then it came time to go to college, nobody was saying anything about Yale.  And I had all these little weekend jobs, you know, cutting grass, and painting houses, and painting the church [Pilgrim Congregational United Church of Christ, Houston, Texas] on the weekends, and all of that but I didn't have any real, you know, resources accumulated to pay any college tuition, or even transportation for that matter.  And that's important as I'll demonstrate in a minute.  So, the closer September came, the more concerned I became about where I was going to school.  And at some point I broached the subject with Reverend Moore, and I don't know what he said but he made it clear that I, well was not going to Yale.  But we had a member of the church, Mrs. Pearl Saunders [ph.], who was just a wonderful lady.  And she--I guess Reverend Moore must've persuaded her--however it came about she loaned me seventy-five dollars to pay my tuition at Texas Southern.
Story_ID: 411422
Speaker 1: This lady helps you--what was her name again?
Speaker 2: Pearl Saunders [ph.].
Speaker 1: Pearl Saunders.  She came up with seventy-five dollars for your enrollment?
Speaker 2: She did that. And I was able to enroll at Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] in the fall of 1952.  I had applied to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] as well, and I was enrolling in the architectural program.  I had some idea about becoming an architect back in those days.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that was your--that, that was the profession that you really had kind of focused on?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my number one choice, but the problem was, Tuskegee is in Alabama, that's a long way from Texas.  And I didn't have the foggiest idea, how I was gone get from Houston [Texas] to Tuskegee [Alabama], so I opted for a local school.  And that's how I ended up at Texas Southern, and they didn't have a full architectural program and my second choice was the law, the pre-law curriculum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 411423
Speaker 1: Now, did you know John Chase [HistoryMaker John S. Chase] then?
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Everybody knows John Chase.
Speaker 1: All right, I didn't know if you knew him then but I, you know, I have to ask.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Was, was he, was he studying architecture with you at the same time or?
Speaker 2: John Chase is an old man.
Speaker 1: Okay. Oh he's old--older than you?
Speaker 2: Much older than I am.  He is the first African American, I think to acquire a degree from the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] in any field.  I believe that's historically accurate (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think that's true.
Speaker 2: And I went to his eightieth birthday party two or three years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he got you by ten years, he's ten or twelve--okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So he's ancient, he's already retired and he's shut his practice down, and I suppose he's traveling all over the country spending the money he got out of that deal.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's a good friend of mine, I mean a very good friend; I love him.
Speaker 1: Is it--so--when, when you were thinking about becoming architect, you--were you inspired by John Chase (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I didn't know who John Chase was back in those days.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I just thought it was something I was good at or could be good at.  But my daddy [Andrew L. Jefferson, Sr.] was a carpenter you see, I'd watch him build things, draw lines.  You know, at one point he had something he called Jefferson and Sons construction company and I was the son (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: So did you help him build things?
Speaker 2: I was out there in the way (laughter).
Speaker 1: Some contracts, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was a little kid in the way.  I remember being on the sites when the foundation was being poured, or when some building was going up but, I never contributed much, I was too little.

Speaker 1: Now, what about Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] now did you--did you find any mentors at Texas Southern?
Speaker 2: Yes, like Henry Allen Bullock was probably my greatest source of inspiration at Texas Southern.  He was a Ph.D. in sociology.  One of my favorite people in the whole world.  And I--my, my president at that time was R. O'Hara Lanier great, great man.  I don't think he taught anything but he was, he was our leader.
Speaker 1: I've heard about Dr. Bullock he's, he's famous for writing something.  I can't think of what it is right now but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did the illustrations in some book he wrote so I ought to know the title of the book but I don't, but he was very productive.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were not only an architectural artist, you, you were--you could illustrate?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, I was good at a lot of things.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's, that's--what do you specialize in pen and ink or ink washes, or what?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) What, whatever it took.  I, I remember--I even had a job of, of redoing some lady's tapestry of the Last Supper, and for the life of me I don't know what happened to it.  It got lost somewhere or somebody walked off with it or something.  So I, I would undertake almost any job.  My friend Carl [ph.], and I would go through the neighborhood in the summer.  We'd paint your screen doors, and walls and yeah, we just did whatever we had to do, to make ends meet, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah Dr. Bullock did somethi- and I can't remember what it is so whoever is listening to this in the future.  Dr. Bullock was a sociologist involved in an important project.  Anybody else of the teachers or students that you met, that you think would be worth mentioning. Now Barbara Jordan (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) None, none worthy of my compliments.
Story_ID: 411425
Speaker 1: You met Barbara Jordan at Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas]?
Speaker 2: And she met me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, we were good buddies-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --until the day she died.
Speaker 1: What are your reflections about her? I mean what, what kind of person--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, she was a wonderful person.  She's just full of fun, and life, she, she could, you know, she could stir you up by reading the menu.  She was just exceptional.  She took her--the talents that God gave her and made the most out of that.  She was not physically attractive, and she knew that.  And she made the difference in, in academic achievement, and in the extent to which she devoted her time, and attention to her studies.  And she was determined to be unforgettable, and that's what she was.  In a short period of time, she died too soon.  But, she made her mark.  Just a--I was lucky to know her as long as I did.  I was the business manager for undergraduate yearbook [The Tiger] for four years.  Each one of my four years in undergrad school.  She was the editor of the yearbook by election in our junior year.  So, for that whole year we got to work together in the publications office together.  She was also president of the Delta chapter [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority], I was president of the Alpha chapter [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity].  And she was just a wonderful person.  I defeated her in the race for president of the freshmen class.  And she always claimed that I stole the election.  But, it was a source of great humor with the two of us.  But, we've always had a great friendship.
Speaker 1: Okay. I think most of us who see her from a national perspective think about her as very formal, and you know, powerful (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well she played, she played the guitar, she sang, she had sisters who were musicians as well.  And they would get together and it was just a family affair.  And she--I mean, she, she was a lot of fun.  Yeah, away from the camera she was just great fun.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's interesting we, we don't hear that about her that much.
Story_ID: 411426
Speaker 1: Now you're a--I didn't ask you about this but you, you're a pretty big fella, you're 6'4"?
Speaker 2: Six two and a half.
Speaker 1: Six two and a half?
Speaker 2: Yeah
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, your secretary said you were 6'4", she's trying to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She's probably, 5'7" one of 'em is.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, but did you play sports or anything in high school or college?
Speaker 2: I played in high school.  I played the whole season of basketball in Crockett [Texas], at '49 [1949].  I played one game of football, 'cause I got there by the end of the football season.  That's--I had--in Crockett had the luxury of having time to play but, in Houston [Texas] I worked the whole time.  I played class ball in Houston at Yates [Jack Yates High School, Houston, Texas].  But, yet all the time here, I was either in school, or working someplace.  And then in undergrad school--I had four jobs at one time as an undergraduate student [at Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas].  I was edit--business, business manager of the yearbook [The Tiger].  I cleaned the church [Pilgrim Congregational United Church of Christ, Houston, Texas] on the weekends, I had a job as an addressograph operator at St. Luke's, St. Children's hospital [ph.].  And I had some other job, I know I took pictures all the time as well.
Speaker 1: That's right, you were a photographer too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, just--I was a hustler.
Speaker 1: Okay, took pictures and are an illustrator--you were an illustrator too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did that too. So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean didn't make any money at it but I helped Bullock [Henry Allen Bullock] do his illustrations.  But, I did real well at taking pictures though.
Speaker 2: Did you ever think about becoming a professional photographer?
Speaker 1: I was a professional photographer for--I was actually making a living at it at some point.  When I went, when I went to law school [University of Texas at Austin School of Law, Austin, Texas], my first job was as a darkroom technician at a studio in Austin [Texas] across from the, from the university, that we called the drag in (unclear).  But, by the time I got out of school, I was pretty much burned out on photography.  Either taking the pictures, or processing 'em.  So, as a consequence as a father, and husband I bet I've taken ten pictures.  I have a camera that doesn't work.  My son [Andrew L. Jefferson III] on the other hand, my oldest son is a portrait photographer so--instead of a lawyer.  So, it worked out all right, and my other son [Martin Henderson] is putting together a video production company of his own.  So, it's still in the blood.  But, I'm just not pursuing it.
Story_ID: 411427
Speaker 1: Now at TSU [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas], now, you--how did you make the transition from focusing on architecture to law?
Speaker 2: Well--it--well the architecture opportunity was not present at Texas Southern as it would've been at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  So, law was my second choice, and it was just lucky that, that the second choice was a good one.  I didn't get that aptitude confirmed until I was in law school [University of Texas at Austin School of Law, Austin, Texas].  When I'd just been given a job as the person in charge of the dormitory where I was living.  And in order to keep the job I had to take a battery of tests.  And the test confirmed that I had an aptitude for the law.  And I was already in law school, which was kind of nice to know.  But, it was just, you know, a shot in the dark.
Story_ID: 411428
Speaker 1: Now, Sweatt v. Painter [Sweatt v. Painter, 1950] case that, that was settled in 1950, am I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Thereabouts, yeah '50 [1950], '51 [1951], somewhere in that range.
Speaker 1: Now did, did you, did you get a chance to meet Heman Sweatt [Heman Marion Sweatt] or?
Speaker 2: I didn't--remember I told you he was a letter carrier from the neighborhood where I grew up on Delano Street in Houston, Texas, off the corner of Holman [Street] and Delano.  And we all knew him.  We saw him in his uniform, with his post office uniform.
Speaker 1: Was his case widely discussed in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Not--probably not.  We were little kids in high school.  In '51 [1951] I would've been a junior in high school [Jack Yates High School, Houston, Texas].  No, we had more important things to talk about.
Speaker 1: Yeah, girls probably, I know--
Speaker 2: Models--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) A junior in high school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) girls for damn, for damn sure, yeah talk about the girls (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 411429
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't ask you about The Ink Spots, I see them on the wall, and I hear that one (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, that, (laughter) that, that picture came from one of The Ink Spots who was selling these pictures at some nightclub I was, I was--or club, and he just went around selling them and I bought it from 'em, cause I felt like, you know, if he was selling them I needed to buy one.  And I, I think we probably had it framed.
Speaker 1: Okay,
Speaker 2: But it doesn't mean anything beyond of a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so you don't know--
Speaker 2: A purchase I made to help a guy, who needed some help.
Speaker 1: Yeah, my understanding that the last surviving Ink Spot is here in Houston [Texas].
Speaker 2: Um-hm that's probably the guy I bought it from.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, okay, I thought you might've known--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 411430
Speaker 1: You knew Heman Sweatt [Heman Marion Sweatt] but you never--did you ever--so there was no discussions about that when you were coming along (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was a old man.  I was in high school [Jack Yates High School, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: So, when you were in, in the--nearing the end of, your tenure at TSU [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas], you, and you were thinking about going to law school, I mean did, did you reflect the Sweatt case [Sweatt v. Painter, 1950] at all?
Speaker 2: No, I knew the best law school in Texas was the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin School of Law, Austin, Texas].  And that's where I was going nobody could keep me out it.  Not anymore, the law by that time had changed so nobody could keep me out.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now, now, where, where did Barbara Jordan go?
Speaker 2: Boston [Boston University School of Law, Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Boston? Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you all stay in touch (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She eventually became a prof- a professor at the University of Texas in the school of public affairs [Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs].  But, she, she attended Boston University law school.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, so, well how did you find the--oh, is there any, is there any other story about TSU we need to discuss before we take you to law school.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It was just a great time. I, I, I loved fraternal life, I was elected the first duke of Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] by the AKA's [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority].  I--in spite of my need to work all these various jobs, I still find, found time to have a social life, a fraternal life.  I loved it, I loved it, undergrad school was a blast.  I really enjoyed it very much.
Speaker 1: Now, you--earlier you described driving a truck with your buddies, you know, in college (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I did that, I did that, like I said it was that fourth job I was trying to remember a minute ago.  And yeah, I had a little '39 [1939] Ford (laughter) cost me a $167.  I didn't have the money to buy that and I borrowed the money from Tom Wilson [ph.], a buddy of mine from New York and paid him back in installments and a slick little old car with white wall tires, boy I was, I was hot to trot.  Yeah, I had a great, great undergraduate experience, and it came time to go to law school I just, you know, turned it up a notch.
Story_ID: 411431
Speaker 1: Now, was it difficult to get in University Texas law school [University of Texas at Austin School of Law, Austin, Texas]?
Speaker 2: I have no idea, I applied, did everything I was supposed do and got in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah
Speaker 1: How many black students were there when you were there (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Five in my class.  There may have been two or three ahead of me so, I'm, I'm number four or five in terms of black students who graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is like 1950 of?
Speaker 2: I graduated in '59 [1959].
Speaker 1: Okay you came out in '59 [1959]? Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, '56 [1956] to '59 [1959], three years.
Speaker 1: Okay. How were you treated generally there?
Speaker 2: On campus? Rea- not badly.  First time I ever met the dean, I, I borrowed money to pay my rent (laughter) and, and he loaned it to me.  That was nice way to get started, he could've said no, and I'd would have been out on the street.  I'd have had to find some other means, place to stay.  I had the job you see in that photographic studio, making a dollar an hour, which meant, as many hours as I worked, you know, I could do as well as I needed to, but I needed--I couldn't work to many hours cause I had to study, and so it was a delicate balance between numbers of hours worked, numbers of hours studied.  And the second year of law school, I, I, stumbled upon an advertisement that the U.S. Post Office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] put out.  They wanted to hire drivers to collect them--you know, them red, white and blue trucks that goes around and collect some mail out of the mail boxes in your neighborhood? And on the corner you have that drop box, you know?  Well they hired three of us from the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] student body to drive those trucks on those routes that took three or four hours a day, for two dollars and sixty-seven cents an hour.  Which is almost three times what I was making.  And I got one of those jobs.  There were three of us, and--which meant I could work less for as much or more than I was making at the studio, and have so much more time to study.  It was a godsend, that's--so that's what I did in my second, and third year, and in the summertime I could carry the mail or clerk on a full time bases, and work as well at Christmastime for extra money.
Speaker 1: So, that was pretty (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Never had it so good.  Yeah, but it, it was hard work but it was very, very satisfying.
Story_ID: 411432
Speaker 1: When you were in law school you, you--I know you were aware but, how keenly were you aware of the people like Thurgood Marshall, and (unclear) and what the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] was doing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know, we had, had class and constitutional law which made it clear, you know, who he was, and what was, what cases were being presented, and what decisions were being made, and that made it easy.  Yeah, but then I have to also add--you ask me how was I treated on--when I was in law school.  And I--my, reaction was to say well on campus.  There is an area though where I want to comment.  For all of my three years of law school '56 [1956] through '59 [1959], I lived in a segregated housing unit on the campus of University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin School of Law, Austin, Texas].  The catalog said this was an integrated housing project, or unit.  But, actually it was a place where black people had to stay, and white people could stay.   There was a dormitory that was set aside for law students.  I believe the name was Simkins Hall [Creekside Residence Hall] named for some former professor [William Stewart Simkins] or judge.  But, only white students were in that hall.  And the dormitory where I, I lived, I was the only law student in the dormitory.  The rest of the students were undergrad students, a few grad students, one architecture student, and, you know, a, a menagerie of folks.  So, all of my classmates are in law school, and all they do is eat, and talk law, and live law.  And I'm over in a situation where it's more difficult for me to benefit from that same culture.  And that, that was limiting to a great extent.  Now at some point, I was in a study group at least one, maybe several.  Where some of my classmates and I met off campus, and studied, and read the materials or outlines that were put out as you can imagine, by somebody who had the course.  And (laughter) I learned probably in my senior year that in the library, the librarian kept copies of all the old exams.  I never knew that in the first two, two and half years.  But, if I'd been in a fraternity, or in the law dorm my roommate would've told me that, you see?  But, it was a cultural thing, it was it was kept from me this--by nature the place where I lived.  And so there was--it was a lot of stuff like that, that I didn't know about and didn't benefit from.
Speaker 1: The word can spread there, but not over to you, because you were over there.
Speaker 2: Well, from the very first day they show you, show you--demonstrates further the point I'm trying to make.  The assignments for your first week are posted on the bulletin board.  So that if--let's assume I've got three classes, my assignments are posted on the bulletin board, and I go waltzing in the class on the first day, expecting to be told what my assignments are.  And the assignments have been notarized, or publicized, and I'm three hundred pages behind because I didn't read the goddamn bulletin board.  I didn't know any better, nobody told me.  Now, if I had been in the dorm with the other law students, someone would've said, "Did you see this assignment?  Did you get the books?"  You see?  So, I started three hundred pages behind.  So, it's just--absolutely just--it's a miracle that you can overcome with that kind of crap.  But, you know, unlike some of the other areas where there were no ropes between me and the white students in the classroom, you know, I sat in the same classroom with the rest of 'em.  I got the same stuff that was being put out for their benefit.
Story_ID: 411433
Speaker 1: The City of Austin [Texas] now that was a different story.  We had to go to what we called the East Side for church, for barbershops, for cafes, the picture shows.  It took maybe the first year, or two before they were integrated.  The Pilgrim Congregational Church, there's one in Austin [sic.] and, and I could go to that church.  But, the--most of the black students were going to Ebenezer [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Austin, Texas] on the East Side.  The Night Hawk restaurant [Austin, Texas], all the restaurants were just all segregated in those days.  And, it was--the dormitories once again--the women for an example, there were no facilities on the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] campus the first year for black women.  They were housed on the old Sam Huston [Samuel Huston College; Huston-Tillotson University, Austin, Texas] campus which was on the corner of I-35 [Interstate 35] and 13th street.  And a station wagon would pick up these ladies every morning and take them to the U, UT campus.  It, it was like the second year they found this facility on Whitis Street [sic. Whitis Avenue] in Austin on the campus of UT, where the black ladies where housed from that point on.  It took litigation to integrate the dorms for the women, and other dorms for the men.  Because, in the first year or two there--we were restricted to those barracks type facilities.  Same way the cafeterias, there were only a couple of cafeterias on campus were black students could eat in '56 [1956], and '57 [1957].  And, litigation--it took litigation to open up those facilities.
Speaker 2: Who filed suit on your behalf?
Speaker 1: I, I don't know who the lead plaintiffs were.  I can't--just can't remember that now.
Story_ID: 411434
Speaker 1: Were there any significant personalities that you remember from those days of law school, teachers or students?
Speaker 2: Mr. Page Keeton [W. Page Keeton] was our dean in law school [University of Texas at Austin School of Law, Austin, Texas].  He was a famous personality, and Charles Alan Wright was probably the most admired professor on campus.  Yeah, he was a renowned federal constitutional expert I, I admired him very much.  He had a football team called the Legal Eagles, and he taught a good course.  He had a--his favorite pair of socks had a champagne glass embroidered on 'em.  Black socks with pink champagne glass.  He loved to kick his heels up on the desk (laughter) so you could see them.  Yeah, he was from Yale [Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut].
Speaker 1: Okay, so was there any particular course of study that you liked the most?
Speaker 2: Constitutional law is what he taught.  And I loved it the most, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there any, any time when you were there where you thought oh, this is too tough I'm not gone make it out of here?
Speaker 2: No, no I don't think like that.  Like the rabbit I jumped up, I gotta make it.  Yeah, no never, never thought of giving up.  Of course I was the only one in my--those five to graduate. In my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were the only one of the five?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they just fell by the wayside man.
Speaker 1: Well, you know what, what caused the rest of 'em to fall by the wayside?
Speaker 2: Law school (laughter).
Speaker 1: It was just tough, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I guess they all had the same disadvantages that you had in terms of where they lived and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know, I won't, I won't agree with that.  We're all different.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One of my best buddies came from very, very privileged circumstances, and--but he just didn't make it.
Story_ID: 411435
Speaker 1: Was there anything significant about your graduation from law school?  I mean, did you march with the rest of the people?
Speaker 2: I don't think I marched. I, I, let's see--where was I when the time came?  My requirements were satisfied during the summer of 1959.  I took the bar in December of 19--no, I passed it in December of '59 [1959].  I don't know when I took it, it may have been in December.  I know I worked as a--I proofed the proceedings from a water law conference that summer for--as a little extra job.  I'm sure I was at the post office as well.  But, I don't remember participating in any ceremony.  Eventually, I spoke at the graduation for University of Texas law school [University of Texas at Austin School of Law, Austin, Texas].  And I know that is a grand affair because it's something called the Sunflower Ceremony.  Where you wear a sunflower on your lapel, and great speech making, it says I lived long enough to make the speech for other graduates.  But, I don't remember attending the ceremony.  When I was licensed, which is a different event from graduation.  No, I don't remember graduation ceremony at all.  Like, in my, my oldest son's case we actually went to his--walking across the stage, time of his life.  So, I, I don't remember doing that.
Speaker 1: How did your parents [Bertha Jefferson-Nathaniel and Andrew L. Jefferson, Sr.] feel about you graduating?  Were they really aware of what you've done?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sure they were.  And I'm sure they were proud, they've always been proud of me.  But, but there was no ceremony where we were all in attendance that I, that I remember.  Not the same as comparing it to being there with my son.  Andrew [Andrew L. Jefferson, III] walked across the stage.  'Cause grad- Andrew didn't graduate he's a couple of credits short, short, shy of a degree.  But, he decided he didn't want one.  He decided to do something else, but he walked across the stage with a fedora, fedora, fedora, you know, the hat that Robert Townsend hat--had on?  And he had made this movie in his senior year, and everybody decided he gone make a--be the next Spike Lee.  So, he--everybody was excited about the possibility of him being a big name one day in the entertainment field.  But, we never had that same experience.
Story_ID: 410654
Speaker 1: Well, did you get a spot in the firm right after law school or what happened?
Speaker 2: Did I get a spot in the firm (laughter)?  Yeah, I got a spot in the firm.  I really did.
Speaker 1: I read somewhere once that lawyers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My, my, my wife [Mary Brown Jefferson] had a sister, Dorothy Lee [ph.].  Dorothy Lee became a school teacher, but in those days when I graduated law school, Dorothy Lee had her own beauty shop, and one of Dorothy Lee's customers was a lady named Emma Lois Washington.  Emma Lois Washington was married to George Washington [George Washington, Jr.], who was a classmate of Heman Sweatt [Heman Marion Sweatt].  George graduated the University of Texas law school [University of Texas at Austin School of Law, Austin, Texas], and on one, one great day, Emma Lois and George were at the beauty shop and somebody learned that I was graduating from law school, and George and I started talking about practicing law together, and when I got out of law school and I, I had a [U.S.] military obligation to pay and I got out of law school, and got license in December of '59 [1959].  I went on active duty in January of '60 [1960].  I served six months active duty in the [U.S.] Army Reserve.  In June of '60 [1960] I came back to Houston [Texas], and started practicing law with George Washington in the firm of Washington and Jefferson [Washington and Jefferson, Attorneys at Law, Houston, Texas], a great firm.  And we practiced together until I became an assistant DA [district attorney] in the San Antonio [Texas].
Speaker 1: The firm was Washington and Jefferson, that's a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes sir, George Washington and Andrew Jefferson [HistoryMaker Andrew L. Jefferson, Jr.].  7500 Chocolate Bayou Road, yes sir, lawyers.
Speaker 1: Okay, it sound like a firm you can trust, Washington and Jefferson (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes sir, (laughter) yes sir and we did good work.
Story_ID: 410655
Speaker 1: Those were the Freedom, Freedom Rider days, lot of that when we were the firm [Washington and Jefferson, Attorneys at Law, Houston, Texas] that represented the Freedom Riders-
Speaker 2: Okay now.
Speaker 1: --and young activists.
Speaker 2: With Freedom Rides being a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right through Houston, Texas.
Speaker 2: Okay, they came through--
Speaker 1: Union Station [Houston, Texas] right down the street from where we're sitting right now.
Speaker 2: Were these the one that originated up in Nashville [Tennessee]?
Speaker 1: Same ones, one in the same.  We were just getting into that work pretty deeply when I got called from another UT [University of Texas at Austin School of Law, Austin, Texas] alum J. Phillip Crawford, said we got an opportunity in San Antonio [Texas], they wanna hire the first assistant DA [district attorney] who happens to be African American, or black, whatever we calling ourselves then.  And I went over an interviewed for that, and got the job, and I left George [George Washington, Jr.] and by that time my roommate Otis King, was in the firm and then Hamah [Hamah King], his brother joined him, and George and they continued to practice law, and I went to prosecute people.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you were appointed this is during the Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] administration, right?
Speaker 1: Well this was a state appointment where I started out.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Appointed by a guy name Charlie Leak Jr. [ph.] Charlie--remember this is in the state system.  Charlie ran for election as DA and he promised the leadership in the black community that if he got elected.  Would they help? He would hire the first black assistant DA and they, they did and he did.
Speaker 2: Okay, so this isn't U.S. district attorney, this is the state.
Speaker 1: My next job was, as an assistant United States attorney (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: That appointment was by Robert Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy].
Speaker 2: Okay. And I served in that job for another six years.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this was 1961 when you were assistant DA for the State of Texas.
Speaker 2: Yeah '61 [1961] and '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: All right, then, it was 1962 that you became a--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: U.S., okay.

Speaker 1: I had a potential client in this room several months ago, and he was up walking around, looking at plaques on the wall, and he made an observation that I hadn't even thought of, and he just started sighing, and ca- I said, "What's the matter?" And he said well, you know, "This is really interesting."  I said, "What is that?"  He said, "You graduated law school [University of Texas at Austin School of Law, Austin, Texas] in 1959?"  I said, "Yeah," and he said, "By 1962, three years later, you were already the assistant United States attorney."  I said, "Yep."  He says, "It's unheard of," and I hadn't even thought about it, but that was a hell of an accomplishment to have done that much in just three years.  I was just--I've always been at the precise, right place at the right time.
Speaker 2: Wow, you must've all, always, also been a good choice, I guess to, I mean, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I've been ready for it.  I've been the guy you could call, take, you know, we wanna do this.  Will you be the first?  And I've been willing to do that.
Speaker 2: How was it to be the first a black district attorney in Texas, assistant DA in Texas (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) It was funny sometime, it was,--you know, it was just absolutely something that nobody had seen or heard of, and--I mean it's (laughter) all along the way, it's been kind of strange experience, whether it was assistant DA, assistant United States attorney.  I became the chief assistant United States attorney.  I mean I was the guy you had to come to, to get things done.  FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], who, whoever the hell you were, they had to come to me.  And then I became corporate counsel Humble Oil and Refining Company [Exxon Company, U.S.A.], another, you know, experience and with people that, that didn't have any black people in their circle of friends.  Then when I became the first district judge and--now that was something, I mean, you know, walking in cou- and this morning for example, I, I took a white client who was arrested by a black state trooper into a court room presided over by a black judge.  You know, things really do change for the better, and the judge and I visited a little bit and he was telling me last week--yesterday as a matter of fact, he was trying to round up about eleven, either present or former black judges here in this community, said that there's so few of us and he wanted to get everybody together, so we could celebrate the achievements, which is good, but there should be more.  But I, I know that I was in--at lunch last week at Memorial golf course [Memorial Park Golf Course, Houston, Texas].  I remembered that I was out there two, three years ago.  We had a conference here in Houston [Texas] of all the black judges in the United States.  Federal judges, and, I was in the coffee shop--that same coffee shop, I was having lunch Tuesday, and the white guy in there looked around and he said, "Who are all those guys?"  And I was (laughter) I was so glad I could answer his question.  I said, "That is your worst nightmare," a hundred black federal judges (laughter).  I went back to drinking my beer.  (Laughter) So that's what's, what's happened, it was progress of a sort, you know, and we don't have enough, but we, we're making it, small steps.
Speaker 2: That's something to consider, a hundred black federal judges.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, that's your worst nightmare.
Story_ID: 410657
Speaker 1: You wanna say a little bit about the Freedom Riders, or the cases, I mean, how did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well those were just times when the, the arrests were being made of people who were charged with loitering and vagrancy and the bullshit.  You know, when the system mistreated people cause it could, and it was up to lawyers to make things right.
Speaker 1: So they were arrested in the bus stations and the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, bus stations, and the lunch counters, and yeah.  Because, you know, we weren't ready for them yet, it wasn't time.  They didn't like the idea of rushing, you know, pressing the question.
Speaker 1: What, what--I've heard that, that the businessmen, white businessmen in the City of Houston [Texas] basically didn't really want a lot of trouble.  Is that, that, true or?
Speaker 2: That's true yeah--the white, it was black leadership and white leadership came together and tried to keep peace yeah.
Speaker 1: So was, was integration a tough sell in, in the City of Houston?
Speaker 2: Sure, it was a tough sell everywhere.  People don't wanna give up power yeah, but they wanna keep peace, it's a delicate, delicate balance.
Speaker 1: What, what were the first facilities to integrate?
Speaker 2: Like everywhere else, lunch counters, and movie houses, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, just being able to go in a sit where you wanted to?
Speaker 2: Sure, yeah, like everybody else, yeah
Speaker 1: Okay. How, how did--was there a big fight over having black clerks in the department stores, that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Well, first fight was over, you know, trying on hats, and clothes and stuff like that.  We were talking just last night about something, we were downstairs--downtown for dinner at Morton's steakhouse [Morton's, The Steakhouse].  We were driving through the--downtown.  And some of the places have closed, Foley's is now Macy's, Sakowitz [Sakowitz Brothers] is closed, and ladies in the car were talking about the old days when you couldn't go into certain stores and, you know, that was the first line of attack trying to open up those facilities.  So, you just go in a try some on, you know, you don't buy anything, but try it on at least.  And, we, we had a lot less trouble here than other places. But, we had our own share of trouble.
Story_ID: 410658
Speaker 1: We had, you know, we had the, the confrontations between the Panthers [Black Panther Party], and the police, and people died.
Speaker 2: This would be in the late '60s [1960s] right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, (unclear) sixty--yeah somewhere between '62 [1962] and '68 [1968] somewhere in there.
Speaker 2: The Panthers weren't formed 'til '65 [1965] '66 [1966] so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We had trouble.
Speaker 2: Who, who was the Panther leadership then do you remember?
Speaker 1: I guess, Ovide Duncantell would've been the guy that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How do you spell his name?
Speaker 1: D-U-N-C-A-N, Duncan, T-E-L-L, D-U-N-C-A-L, D-U-N-C-A-N-T-E-L-L, Ovide, V-I, O-V-I-D-E his first name.
Speaker 2: How did the Panthers get in trouble what were the--what was the--
Speaker 1: They had a, you know, a headquarters and, you know, you had the police department with its internal security intelligence.  What they--what do they call it, they call it internal intelligence or whatever they call themselves and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, internal affairs, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And they going around, you know, trying to play FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], and you know, snoop and, you know rely on informants, and make raids, and all that stuff, them guys were fighting back.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a lot of cities had what they call a Red Squad that's in Chicago [Illinois], they called their police undercover unit that supposedly investigated commies (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I forgot what they call that group here.
Speaker 2: They were like--
Speaker 1: They kept a file on--we eventually learned they kept a file on the black leadership.  Some of the guys on the counsel who were African American had files on 'em and, very uncomplimentary remarks about them and, you know, got to be funny over time.  'Cause, some of the guys who thought they were raising hell weren't regarded very highly by this unit.  Yeah, we had our, we had our bad, bad days.
Story_ID: 410659
Speaker 1: Okay, were you involved in any, any of those civil ca-, cases that you can discuss now?
Speaker 2: Nothing comes to mind except, you know, early days of going up with some of the Freedom Riders cases with George [George Washington, Jr.].  I was kind of the young twerp, and he was the old man doing most of the grunt work (pause).  Nothing--I remember at some point, I had a confrontation with Duncantell [Ovide Duncantell], when I was on the bench.  I was a family court judge at that time, and I remember accusing Ducantell of, of run- tucking his tail and running.  Some confrontation that his group had with the police.  And I thought he should've stood, stood up to them.  And his reaction was to say, "A good general always knows when to retreat" (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's an interesting dialogue, you were encouraging him to stand up to the police.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I've always been kind of a--a little different (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. Now, you, you were a judge in the '70s [1970s] right?
Speaker 2: I went on the bench in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Late '60s [1960s]--been, been after, after?
Speaker 2: Seventy [1970] to '75 [1975], somewhere right in there.  I left in '75 [1975], so we went from '70 [1970] to '75 [1975], or thereabouts (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: You got the resume it on--it should be laid out on there somewhere.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 410660
Speaker 1: How did things--the change, the, the, the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice] change drastically after Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] was elected?
Speaker 2: Did the justice department change drastically after Nixon was elected (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, for you, for the level you were at, you know, was it much of a difference in what the justice department was doing under Nixon as opposed to Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson], Nixon came in '68 [1968], and you were still there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah it changed, yeah it always changed.  When the good guys are in it's better than when the bad guys are in.
Speaker 1: I thought so (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's why, that's why they're in.  That's why they need to be out.  That's (laughter) yeah, sure it was not good for us.  It, it, it, you know, somewhat like the situation we're in now.  Although you do have within the Department of Justice, the career employees who want to do the right thing.  And you have the political appointees who want to do the political thing.  And that's that tension there you see?
Story_ID: 410661
Speaker 1: Why did you leave in '74 [1974]?
Speaker 2: I got a call from--I was sitting in my office, you know, riding high, you know, enjoying myself, prosecuting cases, and I'd gone through a period--when I first started prosecuting the chief judge was a--an old time, old line segregationist from--who told my boss that I was not to prosecute white people.  And I was to prosecute black people, and Mexicans only.  So, I didn't know this of course in the early days.  And it came a point and time where I did a peace of legal work to defend the judge on some legal issue, that was being raised, and he liked the work.  And I started getting compliments, and, and the first thing I knew.  Well the first--first of all I could just start off prosecuting black people.  And then he relaxed the rule a little bit, and let me prosecute Mexicans.  (Laughter) So I--said, "We're gonna give this boy a chance, he can prosecute Mexicans now."  And that guy finally died, and the new guy got to be the chief judge, and then I could--I was an equal opportunity prosecutor.  I could prosecute any son of a bitch that got in my way. (Laughter) So that was a change for me.  But, had to go through those early times without--at a later point found out about the restrictions that had been put on me.  Which, is real demeaning you know?
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't know (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I didn't have any idea.
Speaker 1: --that was coming from whoever was your supervisor--
Speaker 2: From the chief judge.  No it wasn't, he wasn't my supervisor that goddamn judge is not supervisor.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know. But it was coming from whoever (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was coming from the guy who was my supervisor who wouldn't stand up to the judge because the judge was the judge.  You had a lot of that going around.  But, eventually it, it worked out.  It reminds me of the story that is told about Fred Vinson [Fred M. Vinson] was the chief justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.  When Brown v. Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] was first argued.  And the court didn't decide the case after its first submission.  But, required that it be reargued in a new briefs file.  And before the new briefs could be filed, Fred Vinson died.  And, Earl Warren became chief justice of the Supreme Court.  And Felix Frankfurter, who was on the court is supposed to have uttered the words it was the first indication that he had that there was a God. Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay, well what does--what do these times indicate (laughter), I was wondering.
Story_ID: 410662
Speaker 1: Can you tell us any story about who you were allowed to prosecute, what the case was about, and was there ever--I mean a significant story (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh it's, it's, you know, just run of mill.  You know, stolen car cases, prostitution--prostitutes being brought into the country cases, immigration cases, harboring aliens, bank robberies.  Whatever, the whole, you know, smorgasbord of federal crimes.  Yeah, narcotics cases, oh yeah, you got all kinds of possibilities.  But, there was plenty of work to be done.  But, you see I eventually became the chief.  I decided who prosecuted whom, and when, and for what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. When did you become the chief--
Speaker 2: Times just--in a space of six years all that,
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that changed from being the low man, to being the top man.
Speaker 1: So in '68 [1968] you were the chief? Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, chief assistant, U.S. attorney--well you call it the first assistant for Western--the Western District of Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 410663
Speaker 1: Oh, anyway I was 'bout--you, you asked what happened--why did I leave?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I was sitting in my office, visiting with Carl Walker, Jr., Carl Walker was an assistant United States attorney in Houston [Texas], the Southern District of Texas.  And I was in the Western District of Texas, San Antonio [Texas].  Carl was in San Antonio for a YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] meeting.  He was a big YMCA man, and he just come by to visit.  You know, colleagues, talking shop, so while he's sitting in my office, my secretary calls me on the intercom, and says, Richard P. Ryan is on the line for you.  I said, "Who is Richard Ryan?" She says he's general counsel of Humble Oil and Refining Company, which is Exxon [Exxon Company, U.S.A.] now.  So I come on the phone and I say, "Mr. Ryan?  What does the general counsel of Humble want?"  And he says, "We want you," (laughter) and, and so he made--issued an invitation for me to come, an interview to break the ice in the corporate legal department at Humble.  This is April of '68 [1968] and I arranged to come over and he couldn't--mind you this is where I was from ok.  My wife's [Mary Brown Jefferson] from here all right.
Speaker 2: So you were in San Antonio (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) By '68 [1968] we had a child [Andrew L. Jefferson, III].
Speaker 2: Now, you're in Austin [Texas] I'm sorry.  Austin as the assistant district--
Speaker 1: San Antonio-
Speaker 2: San Antonio. Okay, all right, San Antonio.
Speaker 1: --is the headquarters for the Western District of Texas.  Western District of Texas is Au- San Antonio, Austin, Waco [Texas], Del Rio [Texas], El Paso [Texas], Odessa [Texas], Midland [Texas].  All that's the Western District of Texas.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's distinguished from the Southern District of Texas, which is, Houston, McAllen [Texas], Brownsville [Texas]--
Speaker 2: Galveston [Texas].
Speaker 1: Victoria [Texas] and Galveston, right.  In any event, I'm sitting watching television set when Lyndon Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson], my leader, makes a speech.  "I will not accept, nor will I seek, nor will I accept my party's nomination for another term."  This is on the eve of my interview in Houston.  So that put my interview in a different light, and cause it meant my leader was leaving and without a leader, I'd be floundering around looking for another position probably, feeling uncomfortable about the politics of the situation, cause in San Antonio we didn't have any career assistant DAs [district attorney].  They were all, either Democrats or Republican depending on who was in the White House [Washington, D.C.], so I came on over and interviewed with Dick Ryan and he made me an offer that was attractive, and my wife and I decided to move back to Houston, so that's how I got back to Houston in '68 [1968] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 410664
Speaker 1: A lot people don't remember Humble [Humble Oil and Refining Company; Exxon Company, U.S.A.], but Humble was a company that would put a tiger in your tank, I remember that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Symbol of a tiger, and they were a big oil company.
Speaker 2: It was Exxon, that's-
Speaker 1: Exxon, yeah.
Speaker 2: --that's, that's what Exon is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's the old Humble Oil Refining Company.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's the old Standard Oil of New Jersey [Standard Oil Company].
Speaker 1: So, how, how, was corporate life for you?
Speaker 2: It was fun--it--I got--they gave me a good secretary, and a responsible job assignments.  I got to travel--somebody decided to make me kind of a conver- show piece.  The first several months, I was on the airplane flying all over the country meeting my counterparts, and various other parts of the country and pretty soon I had my own list of clients, and I was well received, they followed my advice, and eventually I got transferred to--I started off giving legal advice to the refining department and giving company-wide advice on labor law questions, which is important, because that's where equal employment opportunity lies, and then I eventually went to what they call the trial division to take care of litigation, which is where I wanted to be in the first place.  And I enjoyed it very much, lots of good solid relationships, no real ugly stories about discrimination with the possible of exception of the Petroleum Club [Houston, Texas].
Story_ID: 410665
Speaker 1: I get a call one day from a friend of mine who was a member of the Petroleum Club [Houston, Texas].  Petroleum Club is, you know, the drinking and dancing club located on the top of the Humble [Humble Oil and Refining Company; Exxon Company, U.S.A.] building, and the, the guy who called me was Pete Schlumberger [Pierre Schlumberger], Pete of the Schlumberger family, and he was piping hot, he said, "Jeff [HistoryMaker Andrew L. Jefferson, Jr.]."  I said, "What's up, Pete?"  He said, "I had a lawyer visiting with me from Michigan the other day and he happened to be an African American and so I took him to lunch at the Petroleum Club and they wouldn't let us go to the grill.  They ushered us off to a little private room," and he says, "I'm so pissed off about it, I don't know what to do."  I said "Well, what do you wanna do about it?"  He said, "Well you work for Humble," and he said, "I want to invite you to lunch and see if they'll treat you the same way they treated my friend from Michigan."  I said, "Well, let's give it a shot."  I--I don't supposed I'd been invited by anybody in the company up until that time to go.  I might've been there at some private room meeting type arrangement.  Anyway, Pete and I went and they wouldn't let us on the floor, and I came back to my office boy, and I wrote the damage letter.  I said, look you people are put me in this situation and, and, and now you put me in a situation where I've been embarrassed because my employer won't let me eat lunch in my employer's cloth--club and that's not acceptable.  Well, all hell broke loose, cause I'm one of the country--company lawyers, I mean, I'm just not, you know, anybody so, the letter goes to the, the manager of the employer relations department.  A guy name Ed Dekorsha [ph.] and Ed calls me in the next couple of days and he said, "I think we worked this thing out.  I've been in contact with the board of directors." And part of the problem is that, Humble didn't own the Petroleum Club, the club was a separate entity.  Humble owned the building.  The entity leased the space from the Humble Company.  Part of the rent, the compensation for using this space was fifty memberships that were parceled out amongst various Humble employees, plus one special membership that was available for anybody with--at a certain level in the corporation you could just sign off on that special account with no questions asked and--but the club was actually run by a bunch of East Texas oil men and Ed was calling to tell me that he'd smooth the waters and--so he and I was going to lunch on--in the grill the next couple of days, so this is the manager of the employees' relations firm for the whole company, so he and I hit the door in the grill, and boy the teds--heads were turning and the tongues were wagging, so it went well, no problem, you know, and of course the waiters and everybody was just tickled to death to take care of it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the waiters were black, right? At the Petro club.
Speaker 1: Yeah. To take care of it, yeah, to take care of us and the next night or two Ed called me back and said, "Well, let's go to dinner in the dining room," which is a different room on the other end up on, so, I said, "Okay, let's, let's do it" (laughter) so we go to the dining room and Ed called me in the next couple of days and said, "I got a call."  I said--he said (laughter) I said, "What was the call about?"  He said, "They said don't rub it in our faces," (laughter).  So that's how we turned that corner (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Okay.  We have to stop--
Story_ID: 410666
Speaker 1: All right, so you were at Humble Oil [Humble Oil and Refining Company; Exxon Company, U.S.A.] from '68 [1968] to--
Speaker 2: Seventy [1970]
Speaker 1: Seventy [1970].  And what happened in 1970? Why did you--
Speaker 2: Got a call from Barbara Jordon, Senator Barbara Jordon.  She and Senator Chet Brooks, both of the Texas Senate had been visiting with the governor of Texas.  One Honorable Preston Smith [Preston Earnest Smith].  And it persuaded Preston Smith to appoint the first African American district judge.  Judge of a court of record to be technically correct.  We had at least one municipal judge by that time from the City of Houston [Texas].  I'm not aware we had any other judges in modern times.  Don't know about Reconstruction period, I just don't know the answer to that question.  But, Barbara wanted to know whether I would accept an appointment to the state court bench, and I said I would, and she made it happen.  So, I left the Humble law department, and became a judge of the court of domestic relations for Harris County, Texas.  And became a judge by way of appointment, but I had to run for election.  In, I don't know, '72 [1972] I guess '70 [1970] one of those years.
Speaker 1: It says here '74 [1974].
Speaker 2: Well, that was a different court I ran for in '74 [1974].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So you ran (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I ran twice, first contest and the next was uncontested.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you were there 'til '74 [1974], right?
Speaker 2: I actual--I was on the bench 'til '75 [1975], October the 10th '75 [1975] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. Any, any--this was during a period of time that you had the confrontation with the Black Panther leader [Ovide Duncantell]? And--
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I was on the court of domestic relations, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Story_ID: 410667
Speaker 1: Any memorable cases that you remember from that period?
Speaker 2: Sure, I guess the most significant was the action I took in dismissing an indictment against certain Hispanic defendants, because I found that Hispanics had been systematically excluded from the grand jury in Harris County [Texas].  And that ruling by a state judge was unheard of.  State judges back in that--those days were in a habit of denying motions like that, and letting the federal judges make those rulings.  But, I took the position that I could read as well as any of 'em.  I read and I ruled, it changed the whole system in Harris County.  So that now, the grand juries are truly representative, young and old, black and white, all the races, economic groups.
Speaker 1: Okay. So that was a deliberate act to shake that up on some level?
Speaker 2: That was just my luck to have it--question presented to me as the judge.  And I just wasn't gonna pass the buck.  It was my--the buck stops here.  So, and it did and I did.  But, oh man all hell broke loose.  Oh, geez (laughter).  Yeah.
Speaker 1: What was the position of Hispanics?  I mean, and, and Houston's [Houston, Texas] a city where a lot of a--what I mean people--native Texans were Hispanics at one time.  They were all part of Mexico at one, one point and so, we're not talking about necessarily fresh people coming, but people who been here a long time right, who are natives of the City of Houston?
Speaker 2: Well, citizens--don't care how long they been here, they're citizens like we are (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, okay, but--what, I'm saying but what was their position in those days?  I mean how did they rank in the city?
Speaker 2: They weren't very thought--they weren't thought of very well.  They were considered second class citizens, same as blacks.  And, and some instances worse off, cause were--we raising hell and they weren't.  So a lot of what they've achieved has been on the coattails of what the Civil Rights Movement, movement--Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] all these all these guys did you see?  They been mistreated, oh absolutely-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah.  But, they were being excluded from the grand jury, I found that to be true.  And of course the indictment center--the case involved some damage that had been done to the Jewish syna- synagogue or at least to alleged to have been done.  The Jewish community didn't understand, they thought I was taking a position against them, and they--leadership especially the legal comun- part, part of the Jewish community had to explain new ruling to them.  And I think I got some kind of award from them eventually for courage (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, hear there's a big award out there for, from the Anti-Defamation League, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah I'm, I'm, yeah I'm beloved now but, when that ruling came out they were, you know, they, they didn't understand it.  They didn't understand what the basis was until they--when it was explained they understood it.  But, that was probably the most significant ruling-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from the bench.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --I probably--I know I suppressed a couple of supre- confessions in a case where the authorities had intimidated the defendants by throwing their mother and father in jail, and not letting them out until the defendants confessed.  It was standard stuff like that, but some judges would have.
Story_ID: 410668
Speaker 1: I've heard that the relationship between the police in the black community in Houston [Texas] was, was us versus them relationship for many years (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah (laughter) oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Yeah I, I lived long enough to see some difficulty with--when I was nominated to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in '79 [1979].  A statement I had made before the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights was used to my detriment.  I had made the statement in given testimony before the commission that in my opinion there was a very thin line between the average policeman and the average thug, and I explained it by saying that they come from the same social economic background, one just happens to go in one direction and the other one goes in the other direction.  And so, on the street, this competition that takes place between the good guys and the bad guys is often an extension of the neighborhood fight, you know, and that comment was taken all the way to the Senate judiciary committee [U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary] by a group of policemen, and used to oppose my nomination.  This week I looked at almost an entire page of stories about policemen, convicted plea bargain, involved in some kind of infraction under the law.  And (laughter) I was reminded of my comment--my observation.  I still believe that, but, it was kind of interesting, as I said it was just this week to see all of those police stories about policemen have gone awry.
Speaker 1: Were those local stories from Houston (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, pretty much, yeah.  And that, that, that is a sad fact of life when you can't trust policemen, very sad.  But they got their problems--like any other profession, they've got their bad people and their good people.
Speaker 1: Here in Houston.  Has things changed since a--I know Houston was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'd like to think so--
Speaker 1: --neighborhood-oriented policing, with [HistoryMaker] Lee P.Brown?
Speaker 2: I'd like to think so, I'd like to think so.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I'd like to think so. But you know we're just one more story away from another catastrophe, keep your fingers crossed.
Story_ID: 410669
Speaker 1: Now, we skipped over the '74 [1974] election to municipal judge, I think. Was that, now--
Speaker 2: It was either '72 [1972], or '70 [1970], it must've been '72 [1972], must've been '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My first election.  I came up for election, I drew two opponents and both Anglo.  And in the first primary, that this--that was all--this is all in the Democratic primary.  And in the primary election, I was about five hundred votes short of winning it without a runoff.  I paid to have the votes recounted and still came up about five hundred votes shy, so we had to go into a runoff against one of the two guys who had filed against me, and this is a countywide race, this is not a district, like a school board seat, or city council seat.  This is a, you know, the whole Harris County [Texas].  And I've got an article on that wall back in that room next door and, it describes this election.  And, it's fascinating to read, to see the results out.  First place, I think I raised over fifty thousand dollars, this was unheard of in 1972 for a countywide race.  I had just, black, Chicano, white, the whole legal community.  That was the first year that Bill Hobby [William P. Hobby, Jr.] ran, Bill Hobby, here I go--The Houston Post was the other newspaper in town at that time.  Now it's gone, it's closed down, it was then The Houston Post and the Houston Chronicle.  The Houston Post is owned by the Hobby family.  Oveta Culp Hobby.  You remember that name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I remember the name Hobby--
Speaker 2: She used to be the woman commander of the--
Speaker 1: That's the airport, right?  Is that the same family?
Speaker 2: That's the same.  It was named for Governor Hobby [William P. Hobby, Sr.]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --he was governor of Texas.  Oveta Culp was his, was his wife.  She was the commander of the Women's Army Corps during World War II [WWII], I guess, I [sic.] or II.  Their son Bill Hobby, was involved as they were in the publication of The Houston Post.  And Bill decided in I think '72 [1972] to run for lieutenant governor, which, is actually the most important elective office in our state.  In our constitution, the lieutenant governor has more power than the governor does, but few people know that.  So The Houston Post for that year decided that it couldn't continue its tradition of endorsing in all of these political races because, if they took sides as they had been taking sides, then the people that they didn't endorse would be against Bill, and they wanted Bill to be the lieutenant governor.  So what did they do in that year?  They endorsed three people, The Houston Post did, Richard Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon], Bill Hobby, and me, unheard of (laughter) I mean just flat unheard of, and I just wiped, you know, this other guy out, just a great victory, 67.6 percent of the vote and, and that was the end of my opponent.  The next time I--when I ran for the next bench I, I occupied, I didn't get an opponent because the guys that had already run at me once and lost, so they could direct their energies at somebody else.
Story_ID: 410670
Speaker 1: So that next election for '74 [1974], that '74 election.
Speaker 2: Uncontested.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's always the best way to run.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, you served (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You might wanna read that article and gain--it's got some good stuff in it.  It's on the wall and if it's difficult, just take it off the wall and read it.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, maybe we can get a copy of it.
Speaker 2: It's up, it's up to you.  I don't know.  It's in a big frame, somebody framed it as a favor to me, I don't know how you do that, but whatever you and the ladies work out is fine with me.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, we'll try to work something out.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you reared a law practice in '75 [1975]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, what, what happened in '75 [1975]?  That you decided to--
Speaker 2: Wanted to make money.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I organized a firm and we went to one of the big high rises, Two Shell Plaza [Houston, Texas] and started having fun.  And, then in 1977, I had this idea of running for mayor.  You know, my buddies would, you know, get me all worked up.  They wanted me to be the guy, you know, that carried a banner and--I actually got my friends all committed, support of my family, and all of that and I called somebody in my--media guy in and he sat down, stuck a microphone in my face, he says, "Judge, why do you wanna be a mayor?"  And for thirty minutes I just shot the breeze and I realized I didn't wanna be mayor.  I didn't have any fire in my belly.  We shut it down and announced I wasn't running.  (Laughter) Somebody said, "What a gall of that guy" announcing he's not gonna run, well I, you know, friends had been asking me, wondering what I was gonna do, I'd tell them.  But in '77 [1977]--so, I, I almost--I might've won, but I, I wouldn't have enjoyed it, because talking about, sewer rates, and water, and garbage pickup, it wasn't exciting for me.  I just--no, no way in the world I would've enjoyed it.  I did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who would you have been running against? Who would you have been running against?
Speaker 2: It would've been an open race.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: Could've been Jim McConn [James Joseph McConn] at that point, I'm, I'm not really sure.  But in '75 [1975] when I left the bench.  One of the first things I did, I co-managed for the Hofheinz [Roy Mark Hofheinz] campaign for mayor and he was elected and reelected and that gave me some political advantage at the city hall, at least I thought it did.  It probably did--and it would've been a natural in '77 [1977] for me to become a candidate, but I, I, I think I made the right choice, I just (laughter) took thirty minutes to talking about why and I realized that I didn't want it, didn't want it.  I saw Lee Brown [HistoryMaker Lee P. Brown] when he ran, and I sat there in the audience and when he waved his arms and he raised his voice and I said, "God damn, he really wants to be a mayor," but I didn't have--I didn't have what he had, what I saw in him, I didn't have it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I would've messed it up (laughter) for somebody else.
Story_ID: 410671
Speaker 1: Well, in '79 [1979] you were appointed by Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] to the--
Speaker 2: I was nominated to (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Nominated to, yeah--
Speaker 2: --a seat on the U.S. court of appeals and my nomination died in the [U.S.] Senate when Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] got elected and there were fifteen of us who didn't come out of the committee after Reagan got elected.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you've been in private practice ever since?
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, one of the--some of the memorable cases--
Speaker 2: Every one of them I have is memorable.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: With the exception of maybe federal case--every case I have is a federal case, and my most important is the one I'm working on now.
Speaker 1: Okay, you can't tell us about that one, right?
Speaker 2: No, I might not have to talk about any of them.  My friend Guy Matthews and I and Ken Breitbeil [Kenneth Breitbeil] tried a big civil case against GE Capital [General Electric Capital Corporation] last summer and we got a jury verdict for $138 million dollars; that's also framed out there.  That's the--we haven't collected that money yet, but I sure am looking forward to the day when we do.  It's on appeal to the U.S. Court Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  That was as much fun as I've had in a while.  I did get an acquittal about a month ago of a fellow who was charged with molesting his stepdaughter that was a great--a big thrill. I'll have a civil case, I'll argue Monday morning and that I worked hard on. I do civil and criminal, state and federal and I try to enjoy all of it. I handle the big cases and the little cases.  I, I refuse to say that I'm too good for your child's problem and I get a lot that, "Judge, you gotta help me save my baby."  I said, "How old is your baby?" (Laughter) She says, "Fifty-six," and (laughter) I said, "You know, he's gotta sta- he gotta be on his own one of these days I guess," but--I get a lot of that and so I, I'm just available to help people.
Speaker 1: Any--well--any interesting stories from those kind of cases or?
Speaker 2: I've--yeah every one is interesting, but it's somebody else's story and I'm not gone tell it
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's one of the marks of confidentiality.  I'm working on a big project now that I really enjoy in the healthcare field.  And I'm looking forward to resolving it.  It's a multimillion dollar project where we're defending against allegations of impropriety, and I represent a big hospital.  Yeah, every one of them is a story in itself.  Great stuff (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, do you enjoy representing individuals as much as you do, either way (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I enjoy the court room, yeah I enjoy the court room, the mental gymnastics of it all, trying to outsmart the other side and bringing an element of passion to my client's arguments on his behalf, and making courts understand, you know, what the fairness of the situation and the unfairness of the situation.
Story_ID: 410672
Speaker 1: Do you have a particular legal philosophy that you can share with us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the one I started with (laughter), if you can't explain it to your mama don't do it.  It's the truth, just the absolute, unadulterated truth.  Find it and promote it.
Speaker 1: Okay, your mom [Bertha Jefferson-Nathaniel], your mother is still alive, too (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely, live and kicking (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you'd have to explain it to her.
Speaker 2: She's alive and kicking.  Yes, siree.  I'm surprised she hasn't called since you been here.  She, she checks on her first born on a regular basis.
Story_ID: 410673
Speaker 1: We always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I, I would like in my life time for people to stop reminding me that I'm African American.  I wanna walk in a room and be seen as a man, not as a black man, I, I, I hope I live that long.  Yeah sometimes I get sick of, you know, black people complaining and talking about what we need to overcome, but it's, it's a real, real problem, you know, we need what we need to turn the corner to overcome, but I wish it were not so.
Speaker 1: Do you take any special--I guess pride in being an African American?
Speaker 2: Not especially, I don't think that's where pride comes from.  I don't think that's why I should be proud.  I should be proud as a father, as a human being.  I'm not ashamed, I can't do anything about my African American heritage.  I'm proud of my achievements in spite of the limitations that society put on me because of my skin color.  But, I can't be proud in--proud of my color in and of itself that doesn't mean anything, doesn't mean anything at all.
Story_ID: 410674
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on everything you've done at this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently? If you could?
Speaker 2: No, I celebrated fifty years of marriage yesterday to my bride [Mary Brown Jefferson].  And it was an occasion for me to reflect on my life to this point.  And I was able to say to my two sons [Andrew L. Jefferson, III and Martin Jefferson], and to my wife I wouldn't change anything.  And, I mean that, there's nothing I would change.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That, that--there's no particular courage in saying something like that because, I can't change it.  I'm stuck with where I am, and who I am, and where I've been, and I can't go back and change a single word.  I can't erase a single line.
Story_ID: 410675
Speaker 1: So then, if you look back on everything you've done at this point, is there--what, what, what today as we sit here would you considered to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: It hasn't been written yet.  I'd like to be remembered as the greatest judge who ever sat on a bench in Harris County, Texas.  The one who had the most courage, the most insight, and the most--who, who was willing to apply the law every time he found it.  Who didn't respond to the roar of the crowd, and did not concern himself with what other people thought he should have done.  As long as he knew what he did was right.
Story_ID: 410676
Speaker 1: You're involved in a number of different organizations, a list of volunteer activities, and boards, and so forth, can you tell us about some of those?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm involved less and less the older I get, cause I've learned to say no.  But, I have been over extended but I've always tried to respond where there's a need.  And I probably have been generous to a fault with my time and resources.  And I trust that my family really never finds out the extent to which I've shared their inheritance with others.  But, I can't help it people have been wonderful to me.  The Pearl Saunders [ph.] of the world, the Lutent- the Lorenzo [ph.], what's Lorenzo's last name?  He ran the drug stores, Kelly [Kelly's Drug Store, Houston, Texas].  You know, when I pledged Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity], two Omegas [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity] gave me the money to pay my fees.  John Moore [John D. Moore] was an Omega, my, my pastor.  And Henry Allen Bullock, you know, helped my wife [Mary Brown Jefferson] get her first job in Longview [Texas].  People have just been wonderful to me.  And I, I can't turn my back on other people who appear to need whatever help I can give to them.  So, I'm, I, I'm not, I'm not--I don't have a wish, wish list.  I don't have a list of things I would rather have done a different way.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell us a little bit about the Boule. It's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's been a, been a great joy to serve as a member of the Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity.  We have a group of about fifty members here in Houston.  My wife enjoys the ladies activities.  And it's a great group of people, they were all as you would expect, high achievers in our community.  You met some of them already, and we do good work.  We're doing better than we have traditionally.  You know, for a long, long time it was basically a secret organization.  And we're going more and more public, and reaching out, giving scholarships, and developing a social action program for the community, and that sort of thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay so, so the goals haven't changed with the public notoriety, but just, just people know what they're doing now?
Speaker 2: To, to a greater extent than had been true for seventy-five years.  We just celebrated a one hundredth anniversary a couple of years ago.  And I would think that it's only been within the last ten years, the public has known much about the Boule.
Story_ID: 410677
Speaker 1: Is there anything I haven't asked about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, I'm sure you--there's a lot of stuff we could've talked about, that you haven't talked about?  Go 'head shoot, what's your last question?
Speaker 1: Okay, last question, bears to say, it's very similar to legacy, it's--they always make me ask this, so I'm gonna ask it.  How would you like to remembered sir?
Speaker 2: I think I answered that question a minute ago.
Speaker 1: I think so (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, don't have a better answer than that.  I thought about it, and I want to stay with the answer I gave you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You go, you can go back and check to see what it was.
Speaker 1: Okay. Is there anything you'd like to say about your family, at the end?
Speaker 2: I love 'em, and I'm lucky to have 'em.  Got two--a wonderful wife [Mary Brown Jefferson], and two great sons [Andrew L. Jefferson, III and Martin Jefferson], and I hope one day to have some grandchildren, that's my only disappointment, that I don't any grandchildren.  And I certainly do look forward to that day.
Speaker 1: Okay, well thank you very much for spending the time with us.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You're welcome.  Thank you guys for coming in (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
