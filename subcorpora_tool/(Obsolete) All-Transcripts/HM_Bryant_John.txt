Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) kind of People magazine-ish type.  What is your favorite food?

Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or I ask them what are they passionate about or I'll ask, "What can I do to help you?"  Those are probably three signature statements.
Story_ID: 552077
Speaker 1: John [HistoryMaker John Hope Bryant], we wanna talk a little bit about your family history.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: So we wanna start talking about your mother.  What was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name, what is her name, she's very mu--
Speaker 1: What is her name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) she's very much alive.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry (laughter).  What is her name?
Speaker 2: Her name is Juanita--
Speaker 1: And--and that's a blessing.
Speaker 2: It is a blessing.
Speaker 1: That is a blessing.
Speaker 2: Juanita Murray [Juanita Murray Smith].
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Mississippi, but she really was raised in--in East St. Louis [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Do you know what part of Mississippi?
Speaker 2: I do not.  A little town which is--in East St. Louis.  She moved away so young that she doesn't really know--remember much about it.
Speaker 1: But she was raised in Mis- in--
Speaker 2: East St. Louis.
Speaker 1: East St. Louis, Illinois?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, did she tell you much about her background?
Speaker 2: I know a lot about her background.
Speaker 1: Why don't you tell us about it?
Speaker 2: Well she--she's one of several children, I believe it's eight children, mostly girls.  She, I believe, is the baby.  She grew up in a shotgun shack initially and you could look from the front door through the house through the rear.  There was an outhouse in the back.
Speaker 1: That was in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: That was in East St. Louis I believe, the first house they had in East St. Louis.  And the girls had to stay--sleep together and, and her mother, my grandmother, Vester Murray wasn't the nicest person in the world.  Surely she loved my mom and the kids, she took care of them and made sure that all the kids had what they need--needed growing up.  But she never affirmed her, she never said I love you and you're wonderful, and you'll be successful, and even on her deathbed my grandmother, you know, didn't sort of make that right, didn't close that door.  So my mother, I think, longed for that.  And you--you know, that--unless you break that chain that legacy will continue you into my mother's children.  And so my, my mother told me she loved me every day of my life when I was growing up and I couldn't figure out why she did that, but it worked.  Because I never really had a self-esteem problem.  And I remember I would--I still to this day will say there's a difference between being broke and being poor.  That being broke is economic, but being poor is a disabling frame of mind and a depressed condition of your spirit and you must vow never to be poor again.  That came from my mom.  That philosophy came from my mom.  And so when I think about poverty today I--there's physical poverty and there's spiritual poverty.  The real problem is not physical poverty, the real problem is if I don't like me I can't like you.  If I don't feel good about me, I'm not gonna feel good about you.  If I don't respect me, I'm not gonna respect you.  And if I don't have a purpose in my life, I'm gonna make your life a living hell.  And so my mother was the difference maker in many ways because she turned a storm into a rainbow where she had a rainbow after a storm.  She turned lemons into lemonade vis-a-vis how she was raised.
Story_ID: 552078
Speaker 1: I asked my mother [Juanita Murray Smith] how'd she get financially literate.  She understands money really, really well, much more than my dad [Johnie Will Smith] did.  They divorced over money (laughter).  And she said it was--she--I don't know what kind of answer I was looking for but she gave me a beautiful answer.  She said, "Oh it's really simple."  She says, "I was growing up we had to work part time."  She had to work part time, all the girls did.  And they would give half of the money to mom to take care of the family household bills because there was no father around.
Speaker 2: Now this was the sisters, right?
Speaker 1: My mother and her sisters had to give half of their money to their mother to help with the household bills, household bills.  So she had a streak of independence because her mother basically raised the children by her--herself.
Speaker 2: Now what was--what was her mother's name?
Speaker 1: Vester [Vester Murray].
Speaker 2: Vester.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Vester Murray and--
Speaker 2: Do you know where she was born?
Speaker 1: I do not.  Again because she wasn't the warmest person in the world, it wasn't like I walked around saying, "Hey grandma." It was not that kind of a deal.  (Laughter) When--I remember when my grandmother, and I loved my grandmother for loving my, my mother and she did the best she could for what she had.  She--I was outside--outside the house, I'm from California, I'm throwing rocks.  "Stop that chucking."
Speaker 2: Now this--how old were you at this time?
Speaker 1: Oh I don't know, young.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Young, less than ten.  I don't know what she's talking about, I'm throwing rocks.  "I told you to stop that chucking."  The lady's crazy, I kept throwing rocks.  "God blang-it stop that chucking."  I said, "Mom what the heck is she talking about?  I'm not chucking, I'm throwing rocks," (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What is chucking (laughter)?
Speaker 1: That's what chucking was.  My mother told me, so she was working part time and--when she was working and yeah part time she'd give half of the money to her mom and then--but her mother gambled.  Played the numbers and would gamble.  And so she would often ask the kids, "Hey you guys have any extra money?" Over the 50 percent.  And all the other kids would give it up.  And my mother would--she says, "I'm never gonna lie," but she also just never told her how much money she had left.  So, "Do you have any more money left?"  "Sure," and she'd give her a portion of it.  She always learned to keep a little for yourself, otherwise you'll always be broke.  Even when people love you--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --they can drive you into, into the poorhouse.
Story_ID: 552079
Speaker 1: And that philosophy has, has served her well.  She has bought and sold five homes, is financially independent, lives in Houston, Texas and I asked her, "Are you gonna get married again?"  She said--I says, you know, "Do you want a man?"  She said, "Oh I want a man, I don't need a man."  (Laughter) And she says, "If I get a man, he's gonna be a BMW."
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: I said, "What's a BMW? You mean the car?"  She says, "No, no, a black man working."  She, she doesn't have a self-esteem problem, my mother [Juanita Murray Smith].
Speaker 2: How, how old is your mother, do you know her birthdate?
Speaker 1: Seventy-three going on sixteen.  She's sassy and fast.  She's a, she's a pretty amazing woman.  She's--when she was--well she didn't finish the eighth grade, my--her or my dad [Johnie Will Smith] because in the South in those times u- th- you often had to leave school, you're encouraged to leave school to go work to help with the household bills.  And my mother at age sixty-two went back to high school, got her high school equivalency and I went to see her march with, with eighteen year olds with caps and gowns on to get her high school dip- diploma.
Speaker 2: How did you feel about that? You must have been proud (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh just proud as can be.  She's an amazing, amazing woman.
Speaker 2: What is her birthdate?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  I mean she's seventy- seventy--
Speaker 2: Seventy-three.
Speaker 1: --seventy-four, seventy-three today or yesterday.  So she's seventy-four today or yesterday.  So you can do the math.
Speaker 2: Did she ever say much about her father?
Speaker 1: Not much.  I don't think he was a model citizen (laughter) or a model father.
Story_ID: 552080
Speaker 1: You mentioned that there were other sisters and brothers--
Speaker 2: Of hers [Bryant's mother, Juanita Murray Smith]?
Speaker 1: --do--other sisters--of hers.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you know their names?
Speaker 2: No, I mean, I don't know.  Debra [ph.], I mean I may know a couple of them, but I--I'm not--I'm nowhere near the family historian.  I, I, you know, most families are really--I've experienced most families over the generations, when you're lucky to have generational families they tend to be close.  And my wife [Bryant's first wife, Sheila Kennedy-Bryant], as an example, has what I call the Bill Cosby family.  I mean it's just perfect, if you wanna use that word.  Because of the way in which I grew up and maybe because of some of the dysfunction, I'm not sure, some of the dysfunction in the way in which our grandmother [Vester Murray] and lack of a (laughter) grandfather raised their children, I think that a lot of folks operated out of fear and desperation versus out of love and care, and so versus, versus a spirit of what can I do for you.  You know, what I tend to see is the spirit of what can you do for me.  And, and I've been a sort of a get it done guy, sort of a self-actualized person since I was--my first--I started my first business when I was ten years of age.  So I di- I don't remember having a warm--I don't remem- you know, first cousins and all that stuff.  I mean I know I got them, but only time I ever heard from somebody was when they wanted a loan or wanted a job or wanted tickets to go someplace or--so family to me, other than my immediate family, became--the family and me be--started to equal, you know, need.  And need requests (laughter)--now I wouldn't go so far as to say using, because it wasn't like people were intentionally trying--they weren't trying to hurt me, they were just trying to help themselves.  And I don't mind helping other people if, if all my, all my situation is covered.  But for a long--for, for most of my years as an entrepreneur all of my situation wasn't covered.  So I had to spend most of my time--charity starts at home, you know, you gotta take it.  The plane--the flight attendant says, when the plane is going down you take care--put the oxygen mask on your face first and then your child.  If you can't even save you, you can't save them.  Nothing would make me feel better than to be able to hook everybody up with an opportunity for a job, you know, the opportunity to succeed or fail on their own merit.  And an occasional loan--an occasional loan.  But, you know, that's just when you're growing up without trust funds, you're growing up--growing up without wealthy parents, you gotta self-make yourself.  You, you better be focused.  And so I've always been very focused on achieving my goals and that didn't include a lot of family reunion time and a lot of ancillary stuff.  I really didn't have a social life until my late thirties.  There's a lot of funny stories behind me having a blind spot around not having a social life and around women too. But--
Speaker 1: And we'd like to get to that.
Speaker 2: I'm sure you would.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 552081
Speaker 1: So I have an, I have an amazing--so that which I know about my family, my--my Aunt Lessie Stanley who lives here in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: What is her name?
Speaker 1: Aunt Lessie.
Speaker 2: Lessie Stanley?
Speaker 1: Yeah Lessie Stanley. She's amazing.  She's owns a business on Washington Street or boulevard [Washington Boulevard].  I remember that growing up, it was on Washington something--boulevard, street.
Speaker 2: Do you know what type of business it is or if she--
Speaker 1: They owned a company, they owned real estate and then they had a uniform business.  I think they either since sold it or shut it down, but up until recently they had a uniform business.  And they, they still own real estate.  And so they--I love her and her family, and my, my Uncle Buddy [ph.] who had a fifth grade education owns, what is rumored to be, a quarter of East St. Louis [Illinois] today.  I just think that is so extraordinarily cool.
Speaker 2: What is his last name?
Speaker 1: I don't know, he--I just call him Uncle Buddy.  I'm, I'm sure it's Murray.  Everybody's Murray.  I can get you all these details.
Speaker 2: That would be nice.
Speaker 1: But I mean he, you know, he didn't have--he didn't have, like my mom [Juanita Murray Smith], a formal education, but one of the smartest people you ever wanna meet and has owned a dozen businesses, has taken care of his family's responsibilities, has--is a philanthropist, gives back.  Has been a role model for--for St.--again I think he owns about a quarter of East St. Louis.  He's a--he owns a hospital in East St. Louis.  He's a bad brother.
Story_ID: 552082
Speaker 1: Funny story, my mother [Juanita Murray Smith] told me this story.  Her--one of her uncles who is fair skinned, back in I guess, well I don't wanna--you being so specific I don't wanna give a date, but it, it was a while ago.  During the days clearly of Jim Crow discrimination, he was driving through East St. Louis [Illinois] and was pulled over by a black police officer.  (Laughter) And police officer accused him of speeding.  I don't know what words I can use on this show or not, but I'm sure you'll edit it out if you don't like it.  So the--my great uncle said, "Nigger please, I wasn't speeding."  Well that's a term of endearment, maybe an inappropriate term, but it's a term of endearment between blacks and blacks.  Not the best word, but it's the one we, we've, we used.  And the black police officer assumed he was being called a nigger by--
Speaker 2: By the--
Speaker 1: --a white man.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: 'Cause my--he--my f- my great uncle was fair skinned, very fair skinned (laughter).  So he pulled him out the car and beat the living day--daylights out of him.  So my great uncle sued the City of East St. Louis.  He wasn't upset he was beat up and he wasn't upset that he got pulled over, he was upset that the guy thought he was white (laughter).  And the, the City of East St. Louis was so broke that my family owned title to city hall for years.  A lot of funny stories.  But I--so I know--I know what I call the giants in my family and the heroes and the sheroes in my family, and the people who--who stick out to me are the people who did for themselves and who, who are looking for a hand up and not a handout, and who empowered themselves against the odds.  And you know, those, those people on both sides of my family are obvious to me.
Story_ID: 552083
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your dad? His--
Speaker 2: He's a great man. Great, great man.
Speaker 1: His name is?
Speaker 2: Johnie Will Smith.  I like him more as he gets mellower.  My dad was, in the day, this hawking guy, just really built.  Owned a construction company, was brilliant and hard headed, and prideful so he didn't wanna--he didn't wanna admit he--when he didn't know something, which is not an uncommon trait obviously of anybody who's got an ego.  My mom [Juanita Murray Smith] and my dad in 1971 owned a gas station in South Central L.A. [Los Angeles, California], a eight unit apartment building, a nursery, our own home and a cement contracting business which was stunning and amazing for two people with an eighth grade education, African American in South Central L.A. in the middle of the Civil Rights Movement.  Or on the back drop or the backend of the Civil Rights Movement.  So I, you know, I had enormous pride.  But they argued over money.  Number one cause of divorce in America is money.  Police--you ask a police officer, they prefer to go to a shootout in a bank then to go respond to a domestic dispute.  You get in front of--get in the middle of an arguing couple.  So they, they divorced over money.  My mom went to the bank to get four thousand dollars out to send my brother [Dave Harris] to college, first person in our family to go to college she thought.  He ended up going in the [U.S.] military 'cause there was no money there.  My father got there first.  So they went their separate ways.  And I remember I was on the phone with (laughter), I'm, I'm told I was five when I did this.  I was on the phone with the police.  And the phone was bigger than me, I mean I had the phone.  Maybe, maybe I was younger than five.  I mean the phone was huge in my hand.  And they, they were fighting my mom and dad.
Speaker 1: And this was about the four thousand dollars?
Speaker 2: No, they're, they're fighting over money, this was a diff- this was just one of--one of several arguments (laughter).  Again, my g- dad is this big guy and so my dad was fighting with her.  My mother, who don't take no mess, backed up, pulled off her pump which interestingly enough had a little shoe nail sticking out the back of the heel and she popped him on the back of his head.  Hair hasn't grown there since (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Since.
Speaker 2: And there's a little pierce mark that's still there.  And I was on the phone, I said, "Policeman, policeman come, come, come, my daddy's beating up on my mommy. Uh hold on--policeman, policeman come, come, come my mommy's beating up on my daddy" (laughter).  My mom's no one to mess with.  So even when they were arguing it was--it was still--it was a little bit--there was--there was no risk anybody was going to get really hurt or anybody's going to the hospital or--it was, it was--I'm not gonna say it was fun, but I mean it was always love even when there was frustration.  I mean to this day they--they talk and they argue.  They talk and she's got something to say about something going on in his life and he's got--and he ignores her (laughter).  He--so she'll complain about something and he'll say, "Baby can I have one of those pies you're making," you know.  And then she'll say something smart and then send him the pie.  You know, it's--it's we love in spite of, not because of.  But my, my mom and my dad taught me a lot about unconditional love and, and loving no matter what.
Story_ID: 552084
Speaker 1: So they went their separate ways.  We lost most of those assets.  We lost the--well my dad [Johnie Will Smith] kept the home and he kept the cement contracting business.  Until one day I was on--I went to go live with my mom [Juanita Murray Smith] after they broke up, my mom and my sister [Mara Harris Hoskin], and I didn't know we were divorced.  I just thought we had two separate homes 'cause my parents never made their marriage or their children a battleground, which is so common today.  But tha- I never even knew they were divorced and--
Speaker 2: Now how old were you then?
Speaker 1: Well I was jus- they got divorced when I was five.  Yeah, so this was--so until I was, you know, twelve or so, thirteen I lived with my mom. And I probably got my sensitivity (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But you still thought that they were just living--
Speaker 1: Yeah I just thought, I thought I had two houses.
Speaker 2: That you had two houses?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was pretty cool.  I could lie two places (laughter).  And I, I, I remember that I became very sensitive and aware hanging around these women, 'cause women are very intuitive and very thoughtful, and very reflective and that's probably why today I--I have a level of sensitivity and awareness, I hung around for years these two beautiful amazing women.  It went a little too far, they started putting rollers in my hair and pressing and curling, and--
Speaker 2: Okay, take me back to who these women were?
Speaker 1: They were my mom and my sister.
Speaker 2: Your mom and your sister, okay.
Speaker 1: And when they started pressing and curling my hair I said, "Okay gots to go."  I mean when a brother, when a brother--that's a black man.  When a brother can tell you what if feels like--when, when he can relate to a woman trying to find a way to sleep with rollers, that's a bit much, that's a bit too much information. I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Why do you think they did that?
Speaker 1: Well I mean, they wanted me--they thought--they thought--first of all I was--it, you know, back in those days press and curls were common, you know, it was press and curl, then it was a Jheri curl and, you know.  But, but that's what they did.  That's what they did, they thought it was cute.  I had fire engine red hair back then and they just thought it was cute.  I had long hair.
Speaker 2: Sometimes just gonna give it a little body (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it looked nice when it was done, but it, it jus- you know, it just seemed rather unnatural for me, rollers in--I mean I was a rea- I'm a man, I wasn't sitting in no bed with no rollers in my hair.
Story_ID: 552085
Speaker 1: So anyway, I went to live with my dad [Johnie Will Smith], 'cause my dad is real he-man.  He's the original He-Man and my dad owned a construction company.  And so I said oh shoot this is gonna be bomb, I'm, I'm the boss' son.  I'm gonna get the bomb job over here.  My dad put me on the lowest rung on the construction crew and had me doing menial labor (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And how old were you then?
Speaker 1: Early teens.  Had me doing menial labor, and I skipped over the fact that I started my first business at age ten back in Compton [California], but we'll come back to that.
Speaker 2: We--we didn't finish talking about your dad, 'cause I had--
Speaker 1: No this is my dad.
Speaker 2: Okay, I had some more questions I wanted to ask you about your dad.
Speaker 1: This is my dad.
Speaker 2: Okay, go on.
Speaker 1: So I went to live with dad and so my dad made me do this menial labor.  And that's where I decided that--that when I looked at the calluses on my hand doing construction labor that the only cut I ever wanted to have on my hands anymore was a paper cut depositing a check in the bank.  That I wanted to use my brain, not my back to make money and prosper.  So, but one day I was sitting on the patio he was--my dad was making payroll on Friday to his workers, white workers, black workers, Hispanic workers, which meant it wasn't about white, black, red, brown or yellow, it was about green.  It was about respect and dignity and my dad gave these guys respect and dignity and he treated them well.  And I realized with that money they were paying their mortgage, they're paying their car notes, they were sending their kids to college, then school and pay.  And I said, jus- my dad is a hero, I mean this is amazing, the power of this.  And so maybe that where this sole thought of a Silver Rights Movement was born.  That civil rights was about the state protecting you and giving you, making sure that society give you respect and dignity.  But silver rights was you respecting yourself and empowering yourself with respect and dignity.  And that civil rights was about erasing the color line, but silver rights was about class and poverty, and it had nothing--it wasn't about race. It you know, poverty is not respective of--of color.  And--then but then I learned about ignorance.  My--so a broker would show up to the house after the workers left and one day the broker, mortgage broker, convinced my dad to sign documents he didn't understand and my dad asked the wrong question.  Out of ignorance he asked what was the payment, not what was the interest rate, and he never asked what the interest--the payment is when there is an interest rate attached.  So my dad--one of the great taboos in this country and around the world is money.  Sex and money, we love it, don't understand, don't wanna talk about it.  And we're ashamed to admit we don't understand it.  And my dad didn't understand it, didn't wanna ask the question.  We ended up losing our house.  We didn't lose his house, we lost our house.  This was passed down as I said from generation to generation, and, and my wife and I take care, we--we have built a four unit apartment building on the house of--the foundation of the house that he lost, the second house I grew up in.
Story_ID: 552086
Speaker 1: Now I'd like to go back a little bit to your dad [Johnie Will Smith].  Did--where was he from to his early childhood?
Speaker 2: Again, I think it's--it's either--it's either Mississippi or Alabama, but they're--it's a small town in the South and I believe it's Mississippi, but I can get you the specifics (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did he talk much--did he ever talk much about his childhood? His mother and father?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, no.  No he didn't. That, you know, my dad's generation is, is not the warm, fuzzy, we are the world.  They told you they--they showed you they love you by--they told you they love you by the way they treated you, not what they said to you.  And so my dad it, it was not sort of the warm emotive type.  And so only in these--in--in recent years I've been able to sort of squeeze information out of him.  I just learned last week that he owned a cafe, Johnie's Cafe [ph.] in Flint, Michigan on Liberty Street and something.
Speaker 1: Do you know what year that was?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1959, June 1959 was the date of the picture that I saw.  And I'm actually gonna go back and see, I'm gonna track down the property so I can check it out.  But I mean, so I keep sort of finding out all these nuggets.
Speaker 1: Bits and pieces.  How old is your dad?
Speaker 2: Eighty-three going on eighty-four.
Speaker 1: Does he have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Had.
Speaker 1: Had?
Speaker 2: They've all--the sister is alive.  Val McCoy [ph.], lives in Illinois.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: She's also a self-made shero.
Speaker 1: She lives in what part of Illinois?
Speaker 2: Don't let me start lying, I wanna say St. Louis [sic. East St. Louis, Illinois], but I'm not sure.
Story_ID: 552087
Speaker 1: Did your dad [Johnie Will Smith] and mom [Juanita Murray Smith] ever tell you how they met?
Speaker 2: Oh I know how they met.  They--I mean I don't know the details, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --but I know that he came, he came up from--she was born in Mississippi somewhere and mom said, "We gotta get the hell out of here" (laughter) so they moved to East St. Louis [Illinois].  He came up from, I believe, it was Mississippi and he said, "I need to get the hell out of here," and moved up I guess to--first to Flint, Michigan.  And then he somehow s- met my mother and tracked her down to East St. Louis, sweet talked her and, the meal ticket was, "I want you to be my wife." "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."  "I'll move you to California." "What time?"  And, and that's where they made their home was California.

Speaker 1: Dad [Johnie Will Smith] said, "Let's go to California." I mean, "We'll get married, go to California" (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh, that was the enticement, it worked.
Speaker 1: That was the enticement and that worked.  Do you know what year that was that they got married?
Speaker 2: I have no idea--I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Okay, but they moved, they settled in California.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And moved to what area?
Speaker 2: South Central [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Which is considered black (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well it wasn't south--it's only been South Central since black folks lived there.  It was--it was, you know, it was Los Angeles [California] proper.  There's Martin Luther King Boulevard [Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard], which is now--which was Santa Barbara Boulevard [sic. Santa Barbara Avenue], which is now Martin Luther King Boulevard.
Speaker 1: Okay so that would be--is that the Compton [California], Watts [Los Angeles, California] area?
Speaker 2: No Compton is--is--is much further south, it's considered the county of Los Angeles.  That would be about thirty minutes south of South Central.  So this was sou- this was L.A. proper, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they moved and settled in Los Angeles and--
Speaker 2: My mom [Juanita Murray Smith] moved to Compton after they divorced.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.  Do you know where they lived in South Central? Or the address (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh sure, Santa Barbara. I don't know the physical address, but the Santa Barbara between Crenshaw [Boulevard] and Western [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Okay. And--
Speaker 2: South side of the street.
Story_ID: 552089
Speaker 1: And they had--you have how many brothers and sisters, John [HistoryMaker John Hope Bryant]?
Speaker 2: One brother, one sister, and a half-sister.
Speaker 1: And the age of your siblings?  Names, give me names and ages?
Speaker 2: Mara Hoskin [Mara Harris Hoskin] age fifty, and Dave Harris age fort- fifty-four.  And I have a half-sister Arleen Hayes from my father's [Johnie Will Smith] side, have no idea what age she is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I know she's older than me.
Story_ID: 552090
Speaker 1: Can you tell me a little bit about home life when you were coming up?  You were the baby?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was, I had an amazing childhood.  I think--I think the most amazing thing about my childhood is that it was normal.  Most people I meet have not had a normal childhood.  I mean somebody abused them, somebody beat the crap out of them.  Somebody didn't tell them that--probably the greatest sin I run into all the time is that children are not told they're loved and they weren't nurtured, and they weren't--you know, somebody completely ignored them and they grow up with these enormous insecurities and chips on their shoulders and you know, Hitler [Adolf Hitler] was bu- was a bum adult because he was an unloved kid.  So I think the most something--amazing thing about my childhood was that it was not amazing.  I mean it was just sort of normal.  Now my wife [Bryant's first wife, Sheila Kennedy-Bryant] had like, I said, she's had an Ozzie Harriet ['The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet'] sort of, you know, Bill Cosby family sort of a childhood.  So, but I, I had no complaints.  Like I said, I didn't know we were divorced, thought we had two houses.  I had everything I needed, you know.  I had, you know, more food than I wanted.  I would go to the bathroom and throw it up.  I'd eat it, go to the restroom, keep it in my mouth, (makes sound), you know, 'cause I didn't wanna swallow.
Speaker 1: What can you tell us about your neighborhood?  What do you remember about the--your early neighborhood?
Speaker 2: I know if you--I--I guess the first question, well a lot of dignity, a lot of--a lot of warm, loving, wonderful people.  It was a community, it was a village under siege (laughter).  You know, you had a street behind us where you just didn't go, a lot of gangs.
Speaker 1: What was the name of that street?
Speaker 2: I don't remember the street behind me.  We lived on--we lived on Frailey, 15502 South Frailey [Frailey Avenue, Compton, California] on the corner, south, southeast corner.  And I remember Andre [ph.] lived on this block ahead of me and I remember my Hispanic friend lived on the right and I remember their parents were very protective.  He couldn't come out of the gate basically and he--that whole family has prospered.
Speaker 1: Now Andre is someone that was your best--
Speaker 2: Andre lived--no Andre was not my best friend, he was just a friend of mine.  But his family were--his mom and dad, mom or dad were missing in action.  He just--he ended up in jail, as did his brother.  I remember--most vividly I remember my next door neighbor and George [ph.] was my best friend, he was down the street.  But most vividly I remember was my next door neighbor Tweet [ph.].  And Tweet was ninety-seven pounds wet, a terrorist, he was a community terrorist and everybody was afraid of Tweet, and he would throw dead animals over our fence and he was just a terrorist.  Even, even his family was afraid of him.  And George, who was a straight A student, my friend. George for some reason wanted to be like Tweet.  So George started talking like Tweet, hanging out with Tweet, walking like Tweet, dressing like Tweet, got shot like Tweet.  So Tweet got killed, George got killed.
Speaker 1: And what kind of impact did that have on you?
Speaker 2: Choices.  Life's about choices.  Ones you make for yourself.  Ones other people try to make for you.  And it's subtle little things really matter, little things become really big things.  How you talk, how you walk, how you comport yourself, what you feel about yourself, cracks in the self-esteem, your self-image.  You know, it started with the way he talked and went to the way he dressed, went to--I mean just, you know, it just became a tipping point in the wrong direction.
Story_ID: 552091
Speaker 1: And then you got tipping points in the opposite direction.  My mom [Juanita Murray Smith], you know, told you she--told me she loved me and my dad [Johnie Will Smith] was a businessman, so I wanted to be a businessman.  I wanted to wear--so I wanted a suit and my mom made these--couldn't afford to buy me suits, so she made me suits, ugly little jobs.  And then when you start wearing suites you start seeing suits everywhere.  I started seeing suits in the church.  I started seeing suits, you know, on TV, and my dad was wearing a suit.  I said, so I wanted to--so then I wanted to have a briefcase, so I got a briefcase, there was nothing in it.
Speaker 2: This was at what age?
Speaker 1: Ten.  And there was nothing in my briefcase and I started saying well I gotta have something in the briefcase and so what can I have.  I can't--I don't have any money to buy any inventory for anything--any business.  I said hm, mail order, I can do mail order.  So I--I did mail order for Stacy Adam shoes.  I sold Stacy Adam shoes on mail order.
Speaker 2: Tell me about that?
Speaker 1: Well it's just that simple.
Speaker 2: No, how did you--how did you decide to do Stacy Adams?
Speaker 1: I wanted to get paid (laughter).
Speaker 2: But I mean what was--what was it about Stacy Adams that enticed you to go with that company?
Speaker 1: No inventory.  There were--it--everybody was wearing them, they were cool, they were sexy and you didn't have any inventory costs, I was--I was.
Speaker 2: You were ten years old, how did you--how did you even become aware of the opportunity?
Speaker 1: Oh I mean I asked [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones how did he get so smart, he said, "I'm nosy as hell."  So I was nosy (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So at ten years old, did you get a magazine, did you see an ad in a magazine?
Speaker 1: I'm p- I'm sure I saw it in a magazine, yeah.  And I sold those shoes to all my, all of my teachers.  Sold the shoes, sold the shoes all my teachers and--
Speaker 2: This was in elementary school?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And wha- what school was this?
Speaker 1: That was, that was probably Colin P. Kelly Elementary School [Compton, California] or Alondra Elementary School, it was the same school, they changed the name.
Story_ID: 552092
Speaker 1: And then when I got to Whaley Junior High School [Franklin S. Whaley Junior High School; Franklin S. Whaley Middle School, Compton, California], my first year, I graduated to--well I got there and I noticed another trend.  So the first trend I saw was these kids were wearing these--profile wearing Stacy Adams shoes.  The second trend I saw was all these kids they just loved candy, they loved candy, but there was no candy house near our--anywhere near us.  So you had to go to a liquor store to buy candy and the liquor store was out of the way and I thought it was pretty weird also to buy candy from a liquor store.  So I went to the liquor store and I told the guy, Mr. Mack [ph.], he was selling the wrong kind of candy.  And he said, "Go away little boy I got a college degree."  And I said, "That's nice. I've got cavities.  I'm telling you you're selling the wrong kind of candy."  And so he kept shooing me away and I said--finally I said, "Look why don't you just--why don't you hire me, make me a box boy."  He said, "Okay fine, I'll do anything to shut you up," hired me as a box boy.  I worked for three weeks and I quit.
Speaker 2: And this was in high school?
Speaker 1: Unh-uh, no I was ten.
Speaker 2: Still in elementary school [Colin P. Kelly Elementary School, Compton, California]?
Speaker 1: I was ten.  So I worked for three weeks and I quit.  I stayed there just long enough to learn how to buy wholesale and sell retail, and where he was buying his inventory from, which I saw the side of the box in the inventory room, which was Ira's Food Store.  So I went home to my mom [Juanita Murray Smith], I said, "I've got a business plan now and I need forty bucks [dollars] for inventory."  So before I had no money for inventory, I had no business plan, I just had an idea.  These kids were wearing the Stacy Adams shoes and I saw in a magazine probably the Stacy Adam mail order deal and put two and two together and I had a briefcase already (laughter), I wanted something in the briefcase, and I had a market, because this was all my teachers who wanted to see me successful. And--but the second time around I had some more confidence now.  I actually was willing to risk some capital, so I--I didn't have any capital so I had to get it from my mom.  So my mother didn't necessarily believe in me--
Speaker 2: So your mom was your first investor?
Speaker 1: She was, but, but it wasn't a willing investor.  She just gave me the money to shut me up.  So I, basically if I want something I never relent.  So I just kept asking, kept asking, kept asking. "Okay, okay here, here's the money."  But she wouldn't--she wouldn't let me go anywhere by myself, so she took me to Ira's Food Store.  And the people there, she explained I wanna start a business.  "Oh isn't that cute."  And they gave me some free racks.  I came home, ate through half the inventory.  I hate candy to this day.  And then I--what was a mir- the miraculous part was I sold the rest of the inventory and made enough money to buy new inventory.  I said these guys are making money hand over fist.  I made three hundred bucks a week.
Speaker 2: In grammar school?
Speaker 1: Selling candy.
Story_ID: 552093
Speaker 1: Who were some of your teachers that may have made a great impression on you in elementary school [Colin P. Kelly Elementary School, Compton, California]?
Speaker 2: Don't remember their names.  I remember them, I don't remember their names.  I mean you--I'm, I'm forty-two, but I've--I've lived a life of somebody eighty-two.  I mean I did more by the time I was eighteen--I was homeless for six months of my life when I was eighteen.  I did more--I did more--I had probably run and/or tried a hundred businesses by the time I was twenty.  You know, I had already traveled internationally by the time I was twenty.  I'm, you know, I was from Compton, California.  I mean--I--so I get a lot of stuff compressed in a short period of time.  So for me to remember a name last week is extraordinary, yet alone thirty-five years ago, unless they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What are some of your greatest memories of or some of your memories of high schoo- of elementary school that--that still may stick out in your mind?
Speaker 2: My first kiss and you know, the first time I gave a girl a ring out of a Cracker Jack box and, and, my, you know, be- becoming a businessman and trying not to get beat up (laughter).  'Cause I was wearing these suits, wearing these little--the little For- Lord Fauntleroy suits, the kids thought I had money.  I used to get beat up all the time.  I remember that I was an odd kid.  I remember that I--I sort of intentionally didn't stick in.  I stuck out intentionally.  I didn't--it wasn't like I was trying to stick out but I didn't wanna, but I wouldn't do the things that would allow me to conform.  And I like being an individual.  And my parents [Juanita Murray Smith and Johnie Will Smith] told me it was okay to be an individual, they even wanted me to be an--they said, "Look you can hang around the group but not, but not before you know who you are.  We want you to think for yourself and then you can decide what group you wanna hang out with."
Speaker 1: You have best buddies in--in school that you may still be associated with now?
Speaker 2: Most of my buddies are in prison, probation, parole, or dead.
Story_ID: 552094
Speaker 1: So what year did you graduate grammar school [Colin P. Kelly Elementary School, Compton, California]?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: And you went on to what high school?
Speaker 2: I left my--in middle school, at Whaley Junior High School [Franklin S. Whaley Junior High School; Franklin S. Whaley Middle School, Compton, California] I left and went to live with my dad [Johnie Will Smith].  So I enrolled at ninth grade, which would've been my life--my last year at Whaley in Compton [California], I enrolled in ninth grade at--none of my stories are simple, nothing about my life is simple.
Speaker 1: It's fine.
Speaker 2: My--I went to live with my dad and I told my dad I wanted to be a businessman and I wanted to go to a school for businesspeople.  My dad (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now this was in junior high?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is eighth grade going to ninth grade.
Speaker 1: And you--and your dad lived in?
Speaker 2: South Central [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: In South Central.
Speaker 2: That's a move from Compton to South Central.  So my dad not wanting (unclear) and not wanting to admit he didn't know something said, "Look I'll get you--I'll pay for your school, but I don't, you know, you gotta find it."  He didn't say I didn't wanna--he said I don't know where to--what he should've said was I don't know how to put you in private school.  But he said, "You find the school," and I don't know--I'm a teen, my early teens what do I know.  I open the yellow pages to private schools.  I went down the list.  I saw one that said Hollywood Professional School [Los Angeles, California].  Ah, that sounds like a business school.  So I called up and they told me that the school was from 8:45 to 12:45, four hours a day.  (Claps hands) Hot dog.
Speaker 1: Your kind of school.
Speaker 2: My kind of school.  And we went for an interview and my dad's only question was, "How much?"  I think it was nine hundred dollars a year, which back then was a lot of money, and but these days private school is nine hundred dollars a month, but back then it was nine hundred dollars a year.  And this old lady named Mrs. Mann [Bertha Keller Mann], ninety-two years of age stared at me and stared at me and stared at me.  I just figured she was hard to see--had hard, hard visual, visual skills.  Later I realized that she thought I was an actor because this was a school for actors--it was a school for celebrities who wanted to not go to school on the set, they wanted a normal life for four hours a day and then they went to the set.  I had no set to go to.  So, so I went in the halls and there's Tatum O'Neal and Todd Bridges and all these kids who were acting.  And so she did--she did--in Hollywood you don't ask anybody who are you, there's a presumption.  So she kept staring at me.  She was trying to figure out what show I was on.  That's how I got in Hollywood Professional School.  So that's how I got into acting because when you're in that environment, producers would come on to the school because you had--you had actors, you had singers, dancers, every sort of performing arts.  So producers and casting directors would come to the school.  It was easy picking.  These were kids who are already seasoned, already professional in the arts, and they pick people to be everything from extras to bit roles for some show they were casting.  That's how I got--that's how I became an actor.
Speaker 1: This was in what year?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Okay. Just your first year of high school? Ninth and tenth grade (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ninth and tenth--ninth and tenth grade, and then after that I went to Santa Monica High School [Santa Monica, California].
Story_ID: 552095
Speaker 1: So tell me about your experience at the Hollywood high school?  You said you became an actor, what were some of the things that you performed in?
Speaker 2: I will intentionally not tell you much about my acting years.  I doubt--I--let's just say that there was an interesting period.  I wasn't a very nice person nor was I--nor was I a very good actor.  But I learned how to communicate.  But I do, I do have--I did bit roles, bit parts.
Speaker 1: On television or in film?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'Diff'rent Strokes,' and movies like 'Black Sunday' and I had a TV series called 'Video Villain' [ph.] in San Diego [California] on NBC.  Anyway so, I--and I came here in a parade when Mayor Washington [Harold Washington] was mayor, and I was in a--I was a celebrity guest in a parade in Chicago [Illinois].  I remember that hawk came around and I was wearing some silk suit or something, I knew--I realized Chicago was cold.
Speaker 1: So that must've been the Christmas parade or the--or the Bud Billiken Parade [Bud Billiken Parade and Picnic], our big summer parade.
Speaker 2: It wasn't summer (laughter).
Speaker 1: No not if the hawk was there.
Speaker 2: That hawk got me and I got off the parade route, Sasha [Sasha Daltonn] and I was in a automobile and that hawk hit me, I jumped out of my automobile and walked into a leather shop, bought a leather jacket and walked back out and caught up to my car.  That's how cold it was.
Speaker 1: That was your first Chicago experience?
Speaker 2: So, so, I remember Tatum O'Neal, Ryan O'Neal's daughter, Griffin O'Neal's sister.  Griffin was--had a incredible drug problem even back then.  Tatum O'Neal gave me a ride home one day, but she assumed that I was like every other kid at Hollywood Professional [Hollywood Professional School, Los Angeles, California], which was that I lived in Hollywood Hills [Los Angeles, California].  Actually I lived in South Central [Los Angeles, California].  And so as the street numbers got larger, see you--in South Central L.A. you start--so if you're in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California], you're at Hollywood Boulevard, then Sunset Boulevard, then Melrose Boulevard [sic. Melrose Avenue], and Beverly Boulevard, and at some point below Wilshire [Boulevard] you hit--around Wilshire you hit 1st Street, 3rd Street, 5th Street, 8th Street, 10th Street, 15th Street and she's wondering, where am I going.  I'm sure she had never been below Wilshire in her life.  We hit 20th Street, we hit 35th Street she almost lost her mind.  I have never se- I never knew Sasha a B--a BMW had that turning radius in my life.  She hit a u-turn and I don't think she stopped to let me off.  I think that she slowed down and I sort of rolled out of the car and she (gesture) (laughter).
Speaker 1: This neighborhood is not for me.
Speaker 2: Yeah it's not for her.
Story_ID: 552096
Speaker 1: So you left the Hollywood high school and you went to Santa Monica High [Santa Monica High School, Santa Monica, California]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I again--
Speaker 1: How did that happen?
Speaker 2: I don't know (laughter).  I don't know why I left Hollywood Professional School [Los Angeles, California].  You know, my dad [Johnie Will Smith]--it might have been that my dad--it probably was that my dad didn't pay them, that's probably what it was.  'Cause there was really no reason to leave.  It probably was that he didn't pay them or didn't wanna pay them anymore, nine hundred bucks [dollars] a month--a year, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Juanita Murray Smith] think about that?
Speaker 2: My mom?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what did she think about you going to a high--Prof- Hollywood Professional High?
Speaker 2: I think, you know, I was going to a private school.  She's, you know, she's, she's from the South.  She's--she, you know, came up from humble beginnings.  She lived in Compton, California, you know, her son's going to private school, what could be bad with that.  What they didn't know was that I wanted to be an actor.  They didn't--either didn't know or didn't like it, you know, some combination thereof.  So I had to take, I would take the bus from my house in South Central L.A. [Los Angeles, California] to wherever the interview was for various acting jobs.  And my dad certainly wasn't, wasn't feeling that.  But somehow I ended up at Santa Monica High School.  Again, I'm sure it was be- because of economic reasons.  But my school and my dad and the school.  And I--and I went--and I got bored there.  I wanted to be on the football team, I became the tackling dummy (laughter).  I wanted to be popular and became ostracized and isolated.
Speaker 1: Still wearing suits?
Speaker 2: Still wearing suits, driving a Fleetwood Brougham four door brown Cadillac with Vogue rims and spoked chrome--spoked chrome rims and Vogue tires (laughter).
Speaker 1: A gift from your dad?
Speaker 2: Oh my god I'm like a pimp.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A gift from my dad, it was a cool car.  It saved my life.  I got in an accident and tore, tore up the other car, I was fine.
Speaker 1: I'm sure that--
Speaker 2: Huge car.  And so I ended up--so during all this time I was acting, I was running businesses or trying businesses.  So from age ten on I was--I tried a lot of different things, but I was always focused on business.  And to make a long story short, I got bored at Santa Monica High School 'cause I was making--I was sort of having so much fun with practical education and business, and I took the GED degree [General Educational Development] to get out of Santa Monica early, which Chris Rock calls a Good Enough Diploma.
Speaker 1: Good name for it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 552097
Speaker 1: But now during this time, what was--what was going on in Compton [California] and, and South Central [Los Angeles, California]?  What was the social climate like?
Speaker 2: You now, I don't know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were you involved at all in--
Speaker 2: No, again this is sort of, this sort of is the same answer I gave you about my extended family.  I get--[HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones says if you find something you're passionate about you focus and you take your time, you'll be successful.  I was passionate about business.  I was focused and in a hurry, I wasn't taking my time.  But I--when I get focused I'm laser like and there just wasn't a lot, this was--once I read my books, did--went to my interviews, there wasn't a lot of room.  So there--I.  Somebody once told me I lived in the slum, but I wasn't a slum dweller.  I don't call Compton or South Central a slum, they were beautiful communities, still think it is.  But I was oblivious.
Speaker 1: Especially in those years it was during that time a lot of black people lived there.  Everyone--all the blacks who lived there weren't poor.
Speaker 2: No bl- no South Central, we were middle class.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean we were lower middle class.  We owned businesses.  Certainly when I grew up in--in Compton was--I mean homes were tree lined, manicured, well maintained, there was a lot of dignity, a lot of pride, people were working.  It, it was in my--I think South Central, Compton--went to decline when I was in my twenties probably.  But I was oblivious to what was going on around me.  I mean I--there could've--somebody could've got shot right next to me.  You know, I still ca- I still cannot tell you when somebody's on drugs.  Now all my friends they laugh.  They, they can tell you when somebody's high, what kind of drugs they're on.  I am oblivious.  I don't know whether you're--whether I can--I mean if you're inebriated I know that, but I can't tell.  I never smoked, didn't do drugs, I didn't--it wasn't that I was a saint, I was--
Speaker 1: Focused.
Speaker 2: --focused.

Speaker 1: What was the name of your dad's [Johnie Will Smith] construction company?
Speaker 2: Johnie Smith Work [ph.].
Speaker 1: And you said your mom [Juanita Murray Smith] had several businesses?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  She sold candy (laughter), that's where I got that from, she sold candy to her employers--her emp- her fellow co-workers at McDonnell Douglas aircraft and Boeing aircraft [The Boeing Company].
Speaker 1: That's where she worked?
Speaker 2: That's where she worked.  She sold--she had Nita's, Nita's--oh I always get the name wrong, but basically it was--it was clothing she made.  Nita's Stitches [ph.] or something like that.  She'd make clothes and sell it.  She'd make clothes, food--she'd sell clothes, food and candy at work.
Speaker 1: Food like pies--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and you mentioned pies?

Speaker 1: What did your--do you remember what your--what your earliest remembrances are of your--your brothers and your--and your brother [Dave Harris] and your sister [Mara Harris Hoskin]?
Speaker 2: Sure.  My earliest memory of my brother is throwing up on him.  He went to the [U.S.] Navy.  I wanted to go in the Navy because he was in the Navy and I remember going with him to nav- the naval port in San- in Long Beach [Long Beach Naval Shipyard, California] and helping him paint his bunk gray one weekend.  And I wanted to go in the Navy 'til I found out how much he got paid, and I said that ain't for me.
Speaker 1: It's not enough for me. And how old were you then John [HistoryMaker John Hope Bryant]?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: You don't remember. That's good. Okay. Little boy?
Speaker 2: A little boy.  I remember my brother was the ultimate protector of me, took my whippings for me.
Speaker 1: I remember my sister [Mara Harris Hoskin] would crush my head between beds. (Laughter) My, my mother [Juanita Murray Smith] would leave home and put my sister in charge and my brother [Dave Harris] was off in the [U.S.] Navy by this point, and my sister would have me do my homework and my chores and hers too.  And if I protested that's when my head got crushed between two beds.  And then my best friend George [ph.], or another best fri- or another good friend whose name I can't remember, but I can see him.  They just would laugh their butts off.  I thought they were gonna protect me, and they're like, "Man, we ain't touching your sister.  Your sister, she's, she's dangerous."  I remember, I don't think I ever told this story before publically.  I remember my--my mother--my sister was going out on a date and I said, "Oh I wanna go!"  Going to the movies, back then there was drive-in movies.  And my sister said, "I don't want him going with me," and my mom said, "Well why don't you want him going with you?  What are you going to be doing on a date where you don't want your brother with you?"  So she had to take me with her and she wasn't happy.  And we got to the theater, they had the little recording--the music deal--the sound deal for the movie that you'd hang in your window.  There was--and my sister said, "Well don't you hungry?"  "Yeah!" "Go to the concession stand and get me some--get us some food, here's some money" (laughter).  Sasha [Sasha Daltonn], I went to the concession stand I got me--got us all--hooked us all up.  And I came back to where the car was and the voice box was on the floor--was on the ground.  She moved the car.
Speaker 2: She left you?
Speaker 1: She left me.  And I had to stand at the exit and wait for the cars to pass by to (laughter)--my sister said, "Where you been, we've been looking for you all this time" (laughter).  I had a--I had a fabulous childhood.
Story_ID: 552100
Speaker 1: What were holidays like in your house?
Speaker 2: A lot of love, a lot of laughter.  My sister ha- my mom [Juanita Murray Smith] has a mischievous laugh you could hear it down the street.  A lot of togetherness.  A lot of toys.
Speaker 1: Did you--
Speaker 2: Believed in Santa Claus.
Speaker 1: You did believe in Santa Claus?  What about church, were you a member of a church?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah you lived at church, (unclear) miles (laughter).  Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday.  Oh yeah baby.  If you can get out of church in two hours that was a good day.
Speaker 1: Baptist?
Speaker 2: Baptist.
Speaker 1: When you gave the length of time (laughter).  And what was the name of your--
Speaker 2: Jesus Christ and Mary.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your childhood church?
Speaker 2: Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church [New Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: And the pastor was?
Speaker 2: A pimp.
Speaker 1: His name?
Speaker 2: I don't remember pimps' names.  Reverend--I don't remember his name.  I probably don't even wanna say his name on tape because--but he, he had a little Chrysler limousine.  This church wasn't--we had, I don't know, six and a half members or something.  There were more members in the choir then there was in the pews probably, and this guy was just pimping.  I mean he owned the church.
Speaker 1: And you said the name of it was?
Speaker 2: Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church in South Central L.A. [Los Angeles, California].
Story_ID: 552101
Speaker 1: So we were talking about your church.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Mount (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No that's my daddy's church (laughter).
Speaker 1: Mount Calvary [New Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Los Angeles, California] which you attended every Sunday and several other days during the week, and what influence, what do you think being a member of a church as a young child did for you or participate in its service (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I slept a lot (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you feel that that helped to--with your spiritual foundation, develop you as a spiritual person?
Speaker 2: I know, I'm thinking about the question.  Yes I guess, yes.  Mount Calvary Bi- Missionary Baptist Church was not the best role model--the pastor wasn't the best role model for a Christian experience.  It's one thing to be charismatic, brilliant and corrupt.  It's another thing to be honest and incompetent and boring.  But when you are corrupt, incompetent and boring, it's really bad.  And that was basically my pastor.  He was a thief, if he wasn't an outright thief he was just a charlatan.  And he considered offering his money.  He considered the church, his church.  And he drove around in a limousine, even though the church wasn't (snaps fingers) that big.  And he lived in--high on the hill somewhere and he couldn't preach.  Everything was--, "Hallelujah, thank you Lord, amen."  Okay, I heard that for three hours.  He, he couldn't teach me anything.  If you can't teach me anything, I'm, I get bored, I'm done.  That's what happened at Santa Monica High School [Santa Monica, California] is that I stopped learning and I was like, okay.  And so but I couldn't leave because it was my dad's church.  But yeah I wasn't learning anything.  So when I--when I had--so I didn't go to church for a long time.  When I finally went to--found a church it was Reverend Dr. Cecil Chip Murray [HistoryMaker Reverend Cecil L. "Chip" Murray], a man of letters who could teach me something about the gospel and about Jesus Christ and the Lord, other than how you doing, hallelujah, thank you Lord, amen.  And that was First African Methodist Episcopal Church [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: S- so at what ages or around what period of your life would you say you went to Mount Calvary and did the whole family attend?
Speaker 2: Well, my mom [Juanita Murray Smith] and dad [Johnie Will Smith] were divorced so I--my whole family yeah, my dad--me and my (laughter)--me and my dad and who he was dating, sure we--or me and my dad.  Yeah we would go to--yeah it was just me and my dad, we'd go to church every Sunday.
Speaker 1: We didn't talk too much about the--
Speaker 2: He's always--he's the chairman of the deacon's board, wherever he is, he's chairman.
Speaker 1: Okay, sounds good.  And what about your mother, do you know what church she attended?
Speaker 2: I do not.
Speaker 1: Or if she attended or not?
Speaker 2: She, she would go occasionally.  But my dad was an officer of the church which is a different, which was a different discipline.  Mother goes--my mom and dad go to church to this day.
Speaker 1: At what age did you start attending the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church?  Was that after high school?
Speaker 2: Oh my god, that was well in my adult.  I told you for years I didn't go to church because I rebelled against that experience at Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church.  It's probably a good--it was a decade, more than a decade, a decade and a half before I went to church again.  It was--I was twenty-six, so that was 1992 I went to First A.M.E.
Story_ID: 552102
Speaker 1: What did you do after high school [Santa Monica High School, Santa Monica, California] between 1984 and 1992?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Tell us about those years?
Speaker 2: No, I'm laughing because you can tell me--you ask me what I do in a month and it's exhausting.  You would ask me about years?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  You graduated high school and you did?
Speaker 2: Boy I hate talking about myself, it's so boring.  I graduated from--well I got a GED [General Educational Development] out of high school and I went to one year of city college, bored there too.
Speaker 1: So at this point in--at--in your life did you have any aspirations of being a businessman or an--or what?
Speaker 2: I've always had aspirat- that--all--
Speaker 1: You, you--business has always been part of your life, but what did you want to do?
Speaker 2: That's it.  How--how, where, what and when, and how big was the only other question.  I was--there was no doubt in mind since I was ten years old that I was gonna be businessman, period.  I just thought that--I think the big--the big surprise was--I mean if you had asked me twenty years ago whether I was gonna, you know, run a global nonprofit, I'd say you smoking crack, I mean, no.  How many no--how many ways do you spell no, of course not.  I wanted to be a capitalist.  I wanted to be a--the first black man to run a multinational investment banking and ho- investment holding company.  I was a straight up, hard nose capitalist.  I wanted money, I wanted power, I wanted--it was ab- I was tired about me, now you talk about me (laughter).  So you wanna make--ge- God laugh, tell him your plan.  You know, so I am running a global multi- a global corporation, it is involved in banking and finance, it is a holding company, it is empowering people.  We are building wealth.  It's just we're building wealth for others.  We're empowering others.  It happens to be a nonprofit organization.  I mean--so I mean I'm using a lot of the skills that I grew up with, it's just not use- not using them for the advancement of my own portfolio or my own account per se.  Although I'm rich in spirit as a result of--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --of Operation HOPE [Operation HOPE, Inc.].
Story_ID: 552103
Speaker 1: But when you graduated from high school [Santa Monica High School, Santa Monica, California] in 1984--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what did you then go on to do?
Speaker 2: Oh my god it's so exhausting.  I mean I did everything, concert promotions, I mean, I moved to San Diego [California], and I we- I tried to continue this supposed acting career.  Moved in with my sister [Mara Harris Hoskin] and went to Santa Monica City College [Santa Monica College, Santa Monica, California] for a little bit.  And I stayed with her.  And I had a TV show called 'Video Villain' [ph.] on NBC, and boy was that a flub.  And I was--
Speaker 1: Do you remember what year that was?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: 'Video Villain'?
Speaker 2: 'Video Villain.'  I can tell you that I do remember in ninety--in '86 [1986] I think it was I had, when I was doing concert promotions and that didn't go to work very well (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was this your own company that you started to promote concerts (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All these are my own companies.  I've only worked for somebody twice in my life, a very short period of time.  I worked at a--in my adult life--I worked at a A and P [The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company] and minimart in Malibu [California], and I worked at a private banking firm.  Other than that, I've always worked for myself.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of that firm?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Wade Carter and Company [ph.].
Speaker 1: Wayne Carter?
Speaker 2: W-A-D-E Carter and Company.  Stephan Carter Miller [ph.] was the CEO.  So I went, I went and did this TV show and that saying that failure has a--that success has a thousand mothers and failure is a bastard child is true.  I--people claim me and claim Operation HOPE [Operation HOPE, Inc.] today and claim my business success, reported success, but nobody claims the hundred times I tried, and I've tried at least a hundred times.  But I, you know, I define success as going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.  Just never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever give up.  Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] gave that I Have a Dream speech a hundred times before his March on Washington.  So I just never give up ever, ever, ever, ever.  And I don't listen to people's views about whether I can make it or not.  You know, Dr. King had a C plus in public speaking from Crozer Seminary [Crozer Theological Seminary, Upland, Pennsylvania].  What would have happened if he had listened to his instructors who told him he couldn't make it?
Story_ID: 552104
Speaker 1: It took a high self-esteem, a lot, a lot of discipline, particularly during the hard times, and there were a lot of hard times, tough times.  I was homeless six months of my life when I was eighteen.
Speaker 2: Tell me about that?
Speaker 1: Oh I was arrogant, self-absorbed, believed too much of my own press, thought I was hot S-H-I-T.  God has a funny way of sending messages, whatever goes around comes around.  Lost it all.  Went from living in a beach house in Malibu [California], to living in my Jeep.  And everybody laughed at me, they were celebrating and they had good reason.
Speaker 2: Was that when you were promoting concerts or what were you doing?
Speaker 1: That--that's a result of failing in promoting concerts.
Speaker 2: In--in failing in promoting concerts.
Speaker 1: Yeah, promoting--failing at--yeah, that and a few other things.  And I just ran out of money.
Speaker 2: Do you remember any of the concerts that you promoted?
Speaker 1: Oh sure, there's only one.  I only had one client.  This is how arrogant I was.  There was a--it was the lead singer of The Platters, and this is how bad it was Sasha [Sasha Daltonn].  It wasn't the original lead singer of the original Platters, it was a replacement lead singer of the original Platters named J.C. Parrish, who had--I guess I related to him because he pumped him up--self up to be more than he was, and I used to pump myself.  I was a mediocre actor who had pumped myself up to be a wannabe celebrity.  He was a wannabe original Platters who'd pumped himself up to get people to believe that he was part of the original group, even though he was--there's been a long series of people who've become Platters over the years or whatever yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A lot of groups of Platters.
Speaker 1: No he was original Platters, but he just wasn't the original singer (laughter).  But he had, over time, sort of his story--history became his story (laughter).  And, and I guess--I guess because I was so good at conning he--I don't know I think, I don't know, I related to him in some strange way and no one would hire this guy.  This was just so stupid.  No one would hire this guy to work anywhere and I couldn't figure it out.  What--he--why won't--and so it be--I was offended, what do you mean you won't hire this guy to work, I was his business manager.
Speaker 2: He was a Platter (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, you hire him to work.  You know I couldn't figure it out.  I mean he had a good reason, right.  So I said--this is so stupid.  I said, "Well fine, if you won't hire him to work, I'll hire him myself" (laughter).  So, I created Bryant Group Concerts [ph.] (laughter).  I rented out big halls.  I mean one, one concert was so bad that I had more people on my stage crew then there were in the audience.
Speaker 2: So you rented out halls--
Speaker 1: Huge (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) to promote--to promote him?
Speaker 1: To promote him and his career.  And I had power of attorney over him, which meant that when, when he didn't pay his ten thousand dollar dental bill, they came looking for me.  And one of these halls was--I opened up the Rialto convention center.  I was the first client, they had just built it--
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: No Rialto, California.
Speaker 2: Rialto, okay.
Speaker 1: They had just built it, and I was the first customer.  Two thousand seats.  And I put up posters around Rialto and some--and they get taken down.  So people who are really in the concert promotion business, it's not a very nice business.  I never had a chance.  Between a bad client, naivete and arrogance and real concert promoters, I didn't have a chance.  And I remember I had a celebrity, the guy who, who co-starred with Mel Gibson in--in this series of movies, oh I can't, I can't remember--I'm blanking on it now, but anyway, he was, he was in a lot of movies, he's since passed.  But he came out, I had--I put him in a limousine brought him out from L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and I realized I was on the wrong track when I was dealing with these devastatingly, devastatingly failu- failures of a concert (laughter).  And I'm sitting there really distressed and J.C. Parrish walked up for his paycheck.  And I said, "Come on man, don't you see, don't you see how bad this is."  "I need my money."  That's when I realized that it was all about him.  So, I thought well okay, but I can't walk away from this guy because he, he will fall apart.  And somebody told me, "You know, he's a grown man, he's been liv- he was fine before you--he met you, he's fine now, he'll be fine after you--he'll find somebody else to pawn on."  And I was so concerned about him and oh.  But it took him three weeks, he found somebody else to pawn on.  So I mean, I--I've learned a lot of lessons.  I didn't go through form- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So in the meantime you became homeless?
Speaker 1: I didn't go through formal education, but I--I had--I had a much more powerful education through books, mentors and experiences.  So when all these experiences, you know, shaped me.  When, when people ask me today, "Why, how did you meet with all these CEOs and heads of state?" And today I met with the CEO of Northern Trust here [Northern Trust Corporation, Chicago, Illinois] and I'm going--I've got a call this afternoon when I go to the reception--president of the United States [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] is having a reception.  You know, "How do you do this stuff?"  Well look, you know, I was homeless, I was homeless.  What is somebody gonna tell me? No?  I mean, no? I had no when I walked in.  So it, it did a lot for my confidence.
