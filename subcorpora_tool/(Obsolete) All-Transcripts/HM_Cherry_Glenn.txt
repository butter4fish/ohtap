Speaker 2: My name is Glenn Winfred Cherry, G-L-E-N-N, W-I-N-F-R-E-D, C-H-E-R-R-Y [HistoryMaker Dr. Glenn W. Cherry].
Speaker 1: All right, and what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My date of birth is June 2nd, 1958, in Daytona Beach, Florida.
Speaker 1: And what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: Well, I hold many hats I guess you would say that I am the CEO of Central Florida Communicators Group, LLC [Tampa, Florida], which has two newspapers, the Florida Courier and the Daytona Times.  I'm also run--the CEO of the radio station group which is Redemption Broadcasting--Redemption Strategies Broadcasting [Redemption Strategies Broadcasting, LLC], which has a radio station in Greenville, South Carolina, WCSZ [WCSZ Radio], which is a Spanish language station, and WPUL-AM news, talk, sports station [WPUL Radio] in Daytona Beach, Florida.  Also, I'm a veterinarian.  I have a mobile practice that I, I have that's called Healthy Pets Mobile Veterinary Services [Tampa, Florida], and so, that's my joy to be a veterinarian as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is September 12th, 2014.
Speaker 1: And, where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're at--on location at my home here in Tampa, Florida.
Story_ID: 648864
Speaker 1: Okay, that's good.  Now, before we get started there are five lightweight questions we always ask as kind of a warm up, and--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: First one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: A favorite food.  That'd be tough, what would be my favorite food?  I would say barbecue chicken (laughter).  That's to say if I was to say what I enjoy most.  Yes, I--people would say I always look for the bird.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, what about color? What's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Purple.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Fall.
Speaker 1: Okay, favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Hm, favorite vacation destination. That's an interesting one because I like the Caribbean but I'd probably say either Jamaica, Jamaica probably--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: And the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or, or saying?
Speaker 2: Something my father [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] used to tell me all the time, he used to tell me, "Hold them in the road."
Speaker 1: Hold them in the road?
Speaker 2: Hold them in the road.
Speaker 1: Now, what does it mean?
Speaker 2: He'd say, "Just keep moving forward, don't get off, off, off path, you know, just stay on your path."  So, he'd tell me, "Hold them in the road."
Story_ID: 648865
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to ask about your family history, going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] side but we'll start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Julia, J-U-L-I-A, Troutman, T-R-O-U-T-M-A-N, Cherry, C-H-E-R-R-Y [Julia Troutman Cherry].
Speaker 1: And, what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is eleven--let me think--eleven, sixteen, two--11/16 of '27 [November 16, 1927].
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Leslie, Georgia.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, what can you tell us about your mother's family?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Well, I can tell you that my mother's mother is Emma Mae Troutman [Emma Harris Troutman], and she was born like in 1888, somewhere around there and in that same part of Georgia.  And, you know, I knew her well.  But, my grandfather Willis Troutman died well before any of us was born.  I think he, he died in the '30s [1930s].  So, he, I did not know him.  But, my grandmother, Emma Troutman, had many jobs.  She used to--she was a beautician, she folded clothes for some of the white people that lived in the area, ironed and folded.  I remember when she used to tell us about going out and working in the fields sometimes, in the peanut--shaking peanuts and picking crops and stuff; and so she was an entrepreneur lady.
Story_ID: 648866
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now, Leslie [Georgia] is near, it's near the Carter peanut fields, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, it's near--Leslie--De Soto [Georgia] is near--not far from Americus, Georgia--
Speaker 1: Around, yeah.
Speaker 2: --which is Plains.  Americus, Georgia is where the black people lived, Plains, Georgia was where white people lived and that's where Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] was from, Plains.  And then Leslie, De Soto was the black and white side of that.  Leslie was the black side and De Soto was the white side of town.  So--
Speaker 1: So, it's the same town except that the town--the part the blacks lived in was called Leslie and then the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the part the white people lived in was called De Soto (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) De Soto.  And, Americus and Plains is just the same thing.
Speaker 2: Same thing, yes.  And, my father [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] was from Americus, Georgia.  So, it was a--when, as kids, when we used to go to visit my [maternal] grandmother [Emma Harris Troutman] in Leslie and you'd go down the highway and you'd pull off on the little street that would take you to the different areas, when you got to Leslie, the road changed to a dirt road.  When you're on De Soto, it was paved road.  And, the little country stores and all that kind of stuff was in De Soto.  And we would walk from her house down the dirt road, you cross the railroad tracks and you went into De Soto.  And so, she'd send us to the store to go buy a tub of lard or some flour, or whatever she needed and we'd walk back to her house.
Speaker 1: Now that's something.  Now, you described something that I used to ask about because I, I noticed that in my father's hometown in Kentucky that the, as soon as you got to the black side of town there was gravel and dirt.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And the white side--you knew you were in the white side of town 'cause it was paved.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's true--so, it was no doubt.  You could see the distinction like, you know, when they say--it was always a, railroad tracks that seemed to be somewhere.  If it wasn't, you know, there was some dividing line that, that divided the two communities.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And, everybody said, "Oh, we got along great."  Yeah, but you got along great because everybody lived in separate areas, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.  And, people had to just bite the bullet on certain things because they couldn't change--you know, they, they--well, they eventually were changed or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but things are still being fought, and, so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, we're still working through some of those things.
Speaker 1: Still working through things now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were born in '58 [1958].
Speaker 2: Fifty-eight [1958].
Speaker 1: So, 1958, almost a hundred years after emancipation, you still have a town where blacks live on one side, whites on the other.  Black side of town is not paved, probably lacked a number of city services I would guess.
Story_ID: 648867
Speaker 1: At my [maternal] grandmother's house, she had a, a well in the back of her house; and people used to come and pump water from her well to take home because, you know, there wasn't a lot of sources of water.  So, her, her husband Willis [Willis Troutman], who was a carpenter and builder, he put a well in.  And so, the neighbors--we used to come--we would be sitting outside on the porch or, you know, in the swing.  She had a swing on a big porch outside, and they'd say, "Miss Emma [Emma Harris Troutman], can we get some water?"  And she'd say, "Yeah, go ahead."  And they'd go back with their little buckets and tubs and get water and go down the street, you know.  So, she was like--the neighbors really appreciated the fact that she would share.  And everybody shared during that time.  I remember when across the street there was a--cross the street and a little ways down there was a hog pen, and when they would kill the hogs and they would share some of the meat with everybody who lived on the street.  And, and, everybody kind of fed the hogs.  So, when my grandmother, when she had, you know, food left over or whatever, she'd go over there and dump it in the hog pen.  And, so, they were getting community fed, and so, then everybody kind of shared in that.  So, it was, it was kind of something that coming from--we lived in Daytona Beach [Florida], so we would go on trips to my grandmother's house and after going a few times I used to hate to go then, 'cause I was like, "Oh, man, we got to go to grandma's house.  She doesn't have a bathroom, we have to go to the outhouse."  And, or, you had to use a little--if it was late at night and you couldn't go to the outhouse, they had these porcelain jars.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It had a lid on it and they used to call them slop jars and you had to use the bathroom in that jar and put the lid on it until in the morning when you could take it out.  So, you know, I, I hated to go to grandma's house 'cause she always wanted to cook a lot of food and feed you really big, so that was going to mean you had to, you had to go to the outhouse (laughter).  You couldn't not eat when you went to her house.  It was going to be collard greens and all that kind of stuff that, that would make you have to go to the bathroom.
Speaker 2: That's interesting, that, yeah, 'cause you thinking about what's going to happen next after you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, I would say, "Oh, Lord, we got to go to grandma's house and we going to have to go to the, to the outhouse."  So, after a while though, my dad [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] built her a bathroom in her house and that made it a lot better to go to.  So--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --those are early memories of when I was a small, smaller child, really young child going to visit my relatives in Georgia and, you know, and some of those kind of things.  I told my, my son [Jamal Cherry] that we used to take a bath in a tin tub in the front yard and people'd be walking by and I'd say, "Grandma, we can't take our--get--take a bath.  All these people walking by."  And, she'd say, "Boy, nobody looking at you," (laughter).  And then she'd bathe you and then take the water and use the water and pour it on the rosebushes and, and, you know, recycling the water, you know.  So, you know, as a small child I thought that was very unusual to be bathing outside in a tub, you know, but that was kind of the way things were at that time.
Story_ID: 648868
Speaker 1: Now, what about your mother [Julia Troutman Cherry].  What, what did--what was she like growing up; and what, what kind of opportunities did she have?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother--since her, her father [Willis Troutman], my grandfather died young, she had an older sister [Bobbie Troutman], and they, they were--it was my grandmother [Emma Harris Troutman] and my mother and her sister.  And she was the youngest so she got a chance to kind of do some things that the other, other one couldn't do.  My mother played basketball and she ran track.  And she went to college at Morris Brown on a basketball scholarship in Atlanta [Georgia], Morris Brown College in Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, so, you know, she met my father [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] when they were in high school at Staley High School [A.S. Staley High School] in, over near Americus [Georgia].  So, my mother went on and she was in a home economics major at Morris Brown, so, when I was a kid, my mother was a teacher and she taught science and math.  And she did adult education training where she taught adults how to sew and, and do those kind of home ec kind of a things that she learned while she was in her major.  So, when we were kids, my mother used to sew our clothes.  She could go down--in those days, you know, I don't know if you remember when they had McCall patterns.  You could go and buy these patterns at the--at a sewing store or something and then buy the material, and then you could cut the patterns out.  And she'd measure us all up and we'd--she'd sew pants and shirts and everything.  I didn't know I had a custom tailor 'til I found out how much it costs to have a custom tailor (laughter).  As a kid, my mom was a, was a, you know, fitting us and, and making our clothes.  And so, when it came to anything about that and cooking or just a home, home--taking care of yourself, my mom was excellent at that type of stuff.  But, I, I--she, she essentially gave me a background in science that made me want to go on and do something science, math related.
Story_ID: 648869
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to go to your father's side; and then we'll put them together.  So, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Charles--was Charles William Cherry [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.], and he's senior now because my brother's [HistoryMaker Charles W. Cherry II]--was the second.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth.
Speaker 2: His date of birth was 10/13/28 [October 13, 1928].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was born in Americus, Georgia.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, that's the twin city of Plains [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Twin city of Plains.
Speaker 1: Now, did he, did he know the Carters?
Speaker 2: No, not to my knowledge.  He never mentioned that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Well, what can you tell us about the ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: Well, my grandmother Janie [Janie Barlow Atkins], who was a Barlow and all of the Barlows, Leila and, and my, and her, she had I think a cousin named George Barlow, a lot of Barlows in that area.  So, she was a Barlow.  I did not know my grandfather on that side, Cherry.  I've only heard stories about him.  You know, the stories that I heard had to do with what used to go on in the old days about shotgun weddings.  You know, young girls getting pregnant and then having to get married and then eventually the family sort of ships them off to somebody else and then eventually then the child comes back to the family, and the mom kind of continues to work somewhere else.  And, that's the story I got about my grandma Janie.  She, she ended up moving to New York City [New York, New York] and my dad stayed in Americus with, with Leila Barlow and those who were educators.  And he went to see his mother in the summer times, he would go to New York in the summer and stay with his mom.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, when she moved to New York--now, my grandfather Cherry--
Speaker 1: He's a Charles Cherry too, right?
Speaker 2: No, he was Grady Cherry.
Speaker 1: Grady, okay, Grady Cherry.
Speaker 2: Yes, and so he has another son named Grady that was my brother's [sic.] half-brother and he lives in New York.  And so, there was a--you know, it seems that I think that, you know, because I don't--and on the maternal side, you know, the women were very tight lipped about how things went.  They didn't want the kids to know what was going on so kind of get this kind of story that this is how this all kind out of shook out, was that Cherry that, my father's, my grandfather was north, was in the--went north.  And they went north.  And so, then they said, "Well, Charles--little Charles, he's going to stay here with us and we're going to make sure that he gets a good education and, and that he's, he goes to school."  So, they felt it was best for him to be there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 648870
Speaker 1: So, he stayed in Americus [Georgia], and he played basketball, you know.  He told me a story that, that what kind of motivated him to do the things that he got involved with later when it came to civil rights, and he said that he and this bunch of kids they were skating, there was a local factory that was in the neighborhood and they had the only concrete in the area.  So they'd like to get on their skates and skate down in front of that concrete area.  And there was a security guard stationed there outside as in--they have in most factories and they would--like kids would do, you know how you skate and you know that they're going to come by to tell you, "Don't sk- don't skate up around here."  And then the security guard would come out and run out at you, and everybody'd skate away, right.  So, typical kids game kind of thing.  And so, my father [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] was the youngest of the group of kids that were there and they said, "Let's skate by down in front of the warehouse."  So, they did.  And so, the security guard saw them coming so he got out earlier than they usually thought that he would get out there.  And so, as they scrambled to try to turn to get away, my father slipped down and fell.  And so, as he says as he was trying to get to his skates he was on his knees and he was trying to get up, and the security guard came up behind him and kicked him in the butt and, you know, knocked him down.  And then he scrambled up and got away but he said, but he told me he said, but he promised himself that was going to be the last time a white man ever kicked him in his butt.  So, from that point on, he, he was just, not having anything that looked it may be, remind him of that situation.  And he didn't like anybody else being taken advantage of in the same way.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, when he told me that story, I could understand, you know, why he was--why he sort of became what he did.
Speaker 2: Okay, it's a good story.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, now, your dad, like did he have any other stories about growing up?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, most of, most of them were good stories.  He enjoyed telling us the stories of the stuff that was kind of more fun stuff about what happened at Staley High School [A.S. Staley High School, Americus, Georgia] and, you know, people that we would run into that he knew and how, you know, they almost blew up the chemistry lab in school, those kind of things.  But, mostly it was, you know, I think that even though they lived a separate or segregated life, that they had fun and they enjoyed themselves with, with what they had.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then when I got over to get a chance to go and meet my uncle George [ph.] who was a--had a record store.  And, when we would go to Americus, we'd go by the record store and he'd give us some 45s [45 rpm record].  And the--I don't know if--you know, most of the kids won't know, they had these little spindles that we used to put in, in the records so that you could make it fit on a different type of record player.  You had the big holes on there and, if you had the little spindle, you had to put the spindle in the middle.  So, those spindles you could--were always hard to come by, and so, he would give us some spindles and some records and some 45s and we would be like, "Wow, our uncle George owns a radio--you know, a, a record store.  We can get all the music we want when we go there."  So, they had a family of--they were educated people and they were entrepreneurs.  And, you know, when I say educated people, in that period of time it seemed like most people were--a lot of black families were teachers, you know.  That was a higher level of, you know, of recognition than the normal things, you know, the domestic stuff that most people did.
Story_ID: 648871
Speaker 1: Okay, so, when, when your father [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] got out of Staley [A.S. Staley High School, Americus, Georgia], did he go to college too?
Speaker 2: He went to Morehouse College in Atlanta [Georgia] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: So, my mother [Julia Troutman Cherry] was at Morris Brown [Morris Brown College] in, in Atlanta and he was at Morehouse.
Speaker 1: So, they, they knew each other already but were they dating in college (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  They were dating in, in high school.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  All right, so it may have been some collusion about where they went to school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, maybe, but everybody wanted to go to Atlanta at that point because that was like the black mecca of Georgia and, you know, that was the place to be.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And my, and my aunt Leila [Leila Barlow] and those, they, they were, as I said, having been very educated--I had an Aunt Mabel [ph.] who went to Columbia University [New York, New York].  My aunt Mabel was at Alabama A and M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Normal, Alabama], she was a professor there.  And so, they, they valued education.  And, my aunt Mabel especially as she got on, as she was an educator in Miami Dade high schools [Miami-Dade County Public Schools], she paid for anybody who wanted to go to college that was in the family, she would pay for it.
Speaker 1: Gee, that, that's something to have a relative that can, that could do that and would be willing to do it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Well, she worked hard, she didn't spend her money, she never got married.  And so, any money that she saved, she was willing to pay for you to go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, she'd put you on a payment plan and she'd pay it, you know.  Well, we didn't have many--enough of our relatives took advantage of it but my father was one who did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, what did your father major in at Morehouse?
Speaker 2: He was an accounting major.  Then he played in the band there at Morehouse.
Speaker 1: What did he play?
Speaker 2: He--saxophone.
Story_ID: 648872
Speaker 1: Did he have any stories about Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]?  Now he would have been there--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a product of Benny Mays, Dr. Ben Mays [Benjamin Mays].  And, yeah, he used to tell us about, you know, when they came there everybody had to wear a suit to school, you know.  And, if you didn't have one, they'd try to get you a suit and you had to be clean every, every day, you know, it was a suit and tie every day even if it was the same suit and just change the shirt.  But you had to be dressed appropriately to go to, go to class.  And, if you got in any trouble or you was struggling in school and you made an effort, they'd try to help you.  But, if you looked like you weren't going to make it, they'd give you a bus ticket and send you home.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard the famous story about a bus ticket and there wasn't judicial process in the school or anything.  And so, you'd go see the dean and he'd give you a bus ticket, huh?
Speaker 2: He'd give you a bus ticket (laughter).  I guess they'd say, "We talked to you enough, we not talking anymore, here's your bus ticket, you know, we're sending you home," you know.  And so, at least, I guess you could say they sent you home, they got you home.  They'd give you a bus ticket.
Speaker 1: So, no excuse for hanging around the campus if you were not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nope, nope.  We going to--you got to leave here.  We going to get you back home where you came from.  So, they, they, that--my dad [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] told me that there was a small--there was less than four hundred students altogether in all four classes and, you know, he said that four hundred was the max when he was there.  And that all the guys were very competitive and they wanted to be like Dr. Mays.  Now, Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was there at the same time my father was there.  I think he might have been a year, year behind him or--they weren't classmates but they were schoolmates.  So, I think he may have been a year behind him.
Speaker 1: Did, did he have any personal reflections about Dr. King he shared with you?
Speaker 2: He told me--he told us both that he was not anybody that you would have thought was going to be any greater than anybody else that was at Morehouse at that time.  Said, he was quiet, he came at an earlier age, he was younger than most of them, and, you know, and, and everybody knew that his dad [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] was a big pastor in Atlanta [Georgia].  And so--but, you know, they didn't think that Marty was any different than--they called him Marty--was any different than anybody else.  So, he said, he was very quiet and, you know, he wasn't, you know, a big activist kind of guy when he was in college.
Speaker 1: Was there anybody there with him that he was impressed with that he talked about?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was--started, not John Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson] but it was someone else that was there that was, started one of the major magazines, newspapers.  I can't remember, I'd have to go back and check, but next segment I'll, I'll remind myself.  I'll go back and look and see who was in his class, but there were, there were a lot of people who did some great things that were around during that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he arrived there in--so he was probably there like, what, about '46 [1946] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He got there in '46 [1946] I think, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that sounds right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-six [1946].
Story_ID: 648873
Speaker 1: Did your parents [Julia Troutman Cherry and Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] get married right after college, or?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My dad went to Korea and I think they got married right after he got back from Korea.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your father went to Korea.  Now, is this a--
Speaker 2: Now, when he went to Korea, he told me that he was a quartermaster.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, did he finish school first and then go to Korea or did he go to Korea first?
Speaker 2: He finished school and he went to Korea I think.  When's the Korean War?  Korean War ended '51 [1951], '52 [1952]?
Speaker 1: About '48 [sic. 1950] to '52 [sic. 1953], yeah, about '51 [1951], '52 [1952].
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know what, I'm not sure if he went and came back or if he--because I think he graduated class of '49 [1949], so he would have been there I think after he got out of high school [A.S. Staley High School, Americus, Georgia] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, that sounds, that sounds right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now this is just after Truman [President Harry S. Truman] integrated the United States Army in '48 [1948], so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --he's--did he have any stories about being in the integrated army (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know, as I recall, he said that he came out with an accounting degree, but instead of him being any kind of officer he was a sergeant and a quartermaster, which means that they basically were supply guys.  You know, they counted the uniforms and they handed out, you know, they handed out supplies and whatnot.  And, and, I asked him, "If you had a college degree, why weren't you doing something," you know, I'm thinking like what it'd be like today no matter what color you are.  If you have advanced training, they would use you in whatever training you have but he said that wasn't the case.
Speaker 1: Now, did he take a ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] in college [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, that's the officer track so that's probably why.  But, they still--they, they could have sent him to OCS [Officer Candidate School].
Speaker 2: Yes.  But, he said they didn't do that.  He said all the black guys were quartermasters.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If you were--if you had any education, they made you a quartermaster.  If you didn't, then you had a--you were a foot soldier.
Story_ID: 648874
Speaker 1: So, your father [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] was a sergeant in the Quartermaster Corps [U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And did he serve overseas, or did he?
Speaker 2: Yes, he wa- he served in Korea.
Speaker 1: Okay, in Korea.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I saw very few pictures, I only saw a couple of pictures of, of him when he was in Korea during that time.  And, I can remember it was--he was standing in the snow and so I knew, could tell what time of the season it was, and he had his uniform on.  He didn't look to be too happy (laughter), he wasn't smiling.  He and another black army person, you know, another personnel.  They--I didn't know who he was and he never said who he was.  But, I only saw a couple of pictures of him from that time, so--but when he got back I think he and my mother [Julia Troutman Cherry] got married.  And my father started working in the school system, he got a job at Claflin College [sic. Claflin University] in South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he got, got married in what year?  What would it be you think?
Speaker 2: That probably should have--probably been in the--would have been in the--let me see, Charles [HistoryMaker Charles W. Cherry II] was born in '56 [1956], so, it was probably '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: Okay, so, 1953.  Then he started working at Claflin College--
Speaker 2: Claflin College in South Carolina.
Speaker 1: --Orangeburg.
Speaker 2: Orangeburg, yeah.
Speaker 1: Orangeburg, South Carolina.  Okay, so, so, he was teaching at Claflin.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was in, I (unclear) he was teaching business or accounting.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and then he got the job in Daytona Beach as the business manager at Bethune-Cookman College [Bethune-Cookman University] at that time.  And then, so, they moved to Bethune-Cook- I mean, to Daytona Beach, Florida and, from there.  And, I can remember my mom telling me that she had to move before him and so she got a little apartment, he came down and helped her get a little apartment and then he had to go back to Claflin.  And so, she was there for a minute until he--until everything got situated for him to come to Bethune-Cookman.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, this is the first part of your father's career, we have to follow up with him and get the rest 'cause he does a whole lot of things.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Story_ID: 648875
Speaker 1: But when, when you think about your father's personality, his disposition and--well, both your parents, their dispositions, the way they looked, the way they walked, the way they talked, their talents, sense of humor, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I'm probably, sense of humor, my mother [Julia Troutman Cherry].  She liked to laugh, she was always making friends, she was easygoing.  And, my father [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] was--he was more serious. He'd chuckle every now and then but you didn't hear him laugh a lot, and he was more of the business guy.  And so, he was always on top of the details.  And so, didn't--he didn't speak a whole lot, you know, but when he, when he decided he had something to say, you know, he, he was going to give it to you.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so, but my mother was just the opposite.
Story_ID: 648876
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, can you name your--is it just you and your brother, or do you have a--you have a sister (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I have a sister, I have a younger sister.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, my sister's name is Cassandra.  Katrina is her middle name and Cherry, but now she's married.  Her last name is Kittles [Cassandra Cherry Kittles].
Speaker 1: Okay, and how many years younger than you is she?
Speaker 2: We all are a, a year, and, eighteen months apart.  Some real family planning was going on, I don't know, by accident.
Speaker 1: Okay. But, yeah, she's a year and eight--probably a year and six months separate from the three of us.
Speaker 2: And, what, what did--does she do for a living?
Speaker 1: She works for the family newspaper [Daytona Times] in Daytona [Daytona Beach, Florida]
Speaker 2: Okay.  And, I guess your brother Charles [HistoryMaker Charles W. Cherry II] is the oldest and then comes you, Glenn [HistoryMaker Dr. Glenn W. Cherry].
Speaker 1: He's the oldest.
Speaker 2: How would you describe your brother's career?
Speaker 1: He's--my brother's personality is more like my dad [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.], okay.  And, he--but I think that was somewhat, what older kids had to be like, you know, the older kids had to be more responsible.  He always had to look out for his brothers and sisters, you know, take care of your brother and sister.  So, I think--and then my dad probably had a lot of influence in part of his track because he was Charles number two and my father always thought that he needed an attorney in the family.  So, he sort of directed my brother toward being an attorney, and so--but they, they're very similar in personalities and talents.  And, Charles was always an avid reader.  I can remember when we were kids growing up and everybody--you remember when you used to buy the encyclopedias and we had the Encyclopedia Britannica, and we were very happy we had these encyclopedias because otherwise you had to go to the library to try to get something to read.  And, Charles read every encyclopedia that we had at the house.  And I found that to be amazing because I did not have the focus to read every book that was there.  So, he could stay in his room and read, you know, and be happy.  So, I think that's what makes him the person that he's able to be as an attorney, that kind of focus on reading and writing, and also the publisher of the newspapers.
Story_ID: 648877
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Earliest childhood memory that I have would probably be at the house, at the house that I basically was born in.  Charles [HistoryMaker Charles W. Cherry II] was already a child when my father [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] built the house at 623 Orange Avenue [Daytona Beach, Florida] and--but that was the house--they were building that house or just about completed the house when I was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, all of my early childhood recollections have to probably do or being around that neighborhood in that house.  And, I can remember the fact that my dad had a real estate company that was called Mormen Realty and the sign was on the side of the house and his office was downstairs.  And that in that house it was a two story big brick building and it was divided into almost like quarters, and we lived on one quarter upstairs and then there was the quarter upstairs next to us was an apartment.  And the two downstairs were separate.  At one point in time, there was one big opening that the Y, the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] was downstairs underneath our building where we lived for a while.  And then, after that, he divided that downstairs in half and rented each side of the downstairs.  So, we essentially lived in this big house that everybody thought we lived in, but we only lived in a quarter of it.  And the rest of it was producing I guess revenue I guess for my dad to pay whatever it was that, you know, he was trying to do.
Story_ID: 648878
Speaker 1: So, he was an entrepreneur and very frugal I guess.
Speaker 2: Yes, very frugal guy.  And, you know, I think that part of his ability to say and do whatever he wanted to do was because his income was not derived outside of the community or, or, you know, basically white people didn't have any control over where he made his money.
Speaker 1: Okay, and he was an activist, member of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], right, president, (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he became that later.  In the beginning my father [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] was--when he became an activist, he was a member of the CCC, it was called the Citizens Coordinating Committee.  And, at that time, they were sort of the southern--I don't know if you could say southern branch or the southern impression of the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] in California.  So, he didn't start out on the nonviolent side of the house, he was with the side that said, "If you shoot at us, we're shooting back," you know.
Speaker 1: So, this is a--so, was he associated with Huey Newton [Huey P. Newton] or Bobby Seale or any of those other--
Speaker 2: I don't know, I was a young boy at that time.  All I knew was that there was an office that was up near the college and that, you know, they had the black gloves and the berets and, you know--and they were, you know, the Panthers had various things.  They had feeding programs, they had stuff that they were doing in the community was good stuff.  You know, only thing that you saw on media was, you know, the fact that they looked like they were ready to have a, a war, you know, and had guns and stuff, but, for the most part, they were saying, hey, we're here in the community, we're taking care of our community, don't come in here trying to run through shooting at people and doing that kind of stuff 'cause we're not having it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, but for the other side it was, you know, feeding people, clothing them, trying to help them when they had problems, you know.  If there were some issues that had to do with racism or, you know, that kind of stuff they would do--they would go down and try to confront the folks about that.  So, that was where he started.  And, then he had a restaurant called the College Corner [ph.] that was right near Bethune-Cookman [Bethune-Cookman College; Bethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida] as well.  So, he was an activist but he was always an entrepreneur.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he know Stokely Carmichael who later became Kwame Ture? 'Cause I know he was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know, I don't recall, I don't recall that in my, you know, my, my thoughts because the CCC was a--sort of like--I remember that as sort of a passing period in time before he then told me that he had a chance to talk to Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  And, because of their Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] connections, I think King was coming through Florida and they got together.  And so, then he started changing from where he was there to what King was talking about.  And so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That'd be a nonviolent strategy.
Speaker 2: Right, a nonviolent strategy.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, then he became less a supporter of, you know, shooting back to the nonviolent side.
Story_ID: 648879
Speaker 1: Now, there's a, a new book called 'We Will Shoot Back' ['We Will Shoot Back: Armed Resistance in the Mississippi Freedom Movement,' Akinyele Omowale Umoja] about black activists in the South who advocated shooting back and actually did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --which has been kind of lost in history.  You know, the most famous person I guess involved in that was Robert F. Williams who wrote the book 'Negroes with Guns.'
Speaker 2: Yes, I remember seeing that one, yeah, yeah.  And, I, and I think that's where he was.  He was like, you know, having come out of the [U.S. military] service, he wasn't--he didn't have any problems with guns.  I, I can recall when I was a kid and he had shotguns underneath the deck, you know.  In those days, you had a bench seat in the front.  Front seats weren't bucket seats, they were bench seats and underneath the bench seat you could stick a shotgun under there.  And so, you know, I can remember touching a shotgun or two underneath the, the seat of the car, you know.  So, but I think that as he, as he started going on and what happened was he's moved from the CCC [Citizens Coordinating Committee] idea and he started talking about protesting but nonviolent protests, his leadership in the city sort of switched people out of the CCC.  That didn't last long.  And then, so, what I can recall is that then that's when they started working with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and, and SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference], and Abernathy [Ralph Abernathy] and those guys came through.  And so, I used to--my father [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] would have various people that would come through the house whether it was Jesse [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] or Abernathy or those folks.  Or when King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came was coming down he would pick them up and take them through, because that part of the State of Florida was from St. Augustine [Florida] almost to South Florida 'til you got down to close to the (unclear) of Miami [Florida].  That was a very dangerous area of Florida coming through there.  And so, during that period of that time, when they were protesting, they didn't have a bails bondsman in that part of the State of Florida.  So, they asked my dad would he become bails bondsman.  And so, he was bailing out people from--all the way as north almost to Jacksonville [Florida].  'Cause Jacksonville was a black city but you had people in Jacksonville but they were afraid to come out too far out of Jacksonville.  So, he would go up to St. Augustine, you know, over to Ocala [Florida], Gainesville [Florida] where the University of Florida is, south almost to Orlando [Florida], down to Daytona [Daytona Beach, Florida], past Daytona, halfway to South Florida.  And he would arrange that area, if there was somebody that needed to get out of jail that was protesting, then he would go and get them out of jail.  And so, he told me about going up to St. Augustine area to get some people out of jail and before the police let them out they were notifying everybody that they were letting them out of jail.  And so, he said he knew that they were going to be--they were going to get shot at coming out of there, because most the places where they were coming you had to come down a road that, you know, there was woods on both sides.  And so--
Speaker 1: So, they were letting them out to shoot them?
Speaker 2: Yeah, letting them out so they could shoot at them.  So, they let people know we're letting them out.  So, he said he was the bails bondsman, he'd go to get them out and he'd hear them telling everybody that we're letting them go and they would hold them long enough for everybody to get kind of in place.  And so, he said that that's when, when he said, "Well, you had to be smart.  It was sometimes when I was nonviolent and it was sometimes when I was going to protect myself because I wanted to get home."  And so, he said he'd come--coming out of some of those places, they'd start shooting and he said, he'd stick his shotgun out the window and, and shoot a couple shots while he's going down the road just so they'd know, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: 'Cause once they hear something coming back, he said everybody'd duck, they don't know, and he'd--by that time he's down the road, you know.  So--
Story_ID: 648880
Speaker 1: That's an interesting story.  The stories like that do seem to go that way, where the White Citizens' Council, the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK], whatever, that's shooting, that if you shoot back, there's very few stories of a shoot out.
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't a shoot out.  He said, when they started shooting back, you know, it was like there was a little difference between that.  So, I think they knew that he was, you know, he was going to shoot back if there was.  But, he said he never was shooting to hit anybody, he was just shooting to try to, you know, cause a distraction that he could get where he needed to go and get on the road.  So, he drove his big--it was a big Chrysler, you know, big long Chrysler that you could almost hide on, on the floorboards.  You could be like--you could be on the floorboards and you couldn't see anything.  So, so, I think that that's part of why we lived in, the house that we lived in was, as I'm sure that my, my brother Charles [HistoryMaker Charles W. Cherry II], would tell you it was--we used to call it a bomb shelter.  Because it was built out of cinder blocks, rebar, plaster, it had--the only wood in it was the roof, you know.  And so--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he did say that.  He said your house was like a bomb shelter.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and had bars around the bottom and, you know, you, you, you couldn't do much with it, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All this is, so--
Speaker 2: The cinder blocks were filled, filled with--cinder blocks, of course, were filled with concrete.  So, it was just one giant big square building.
Speaker 1: So, this is all, this is all serious stuff and, in those days, I mean, Birmingham [Alabama] had, had the guy Dynamite Bob [Robert Edward Chambliss] who was bombing black homes in Birmingham and who bombed the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and Harry T. Moore getting killed (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, Harry T. Moore getting killed, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so it was serious business about--you know, it was days when we would come home and my dad [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] would go in the house before we would go in and look around, and then we would come in the house.  And, you know, probably when I was a kid the occasion that stuck out with me most was that they burned a cross in the front of our yard, you know, because our house was on a main street [in Daytona Beach, Florida].  And so, you could jump out and put a cross in front of it without having to really come into the community too much.  And, and so, it wasn't a real big one.  'Cause they couldn't have time to put it in the ground really good, but just the fact that it was one out there, you know, was a, was a trip to me as a kid.
Story_ID: 648881
Speaker 1: The Civil Rights Movement in St. Augustine [Florida], other parts of Florida was just as intense as it was in other states.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: You don't see it dramatized on television as much or (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, the only thing you hear about St. Augustine was when King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was going to get in the pool that they had put muriatic acid in the pool.  And, one of the housekeepers or one of the help people saw them putting the acid in the pool and told Dr. King don't get in the pool.  And, you know, or otherwise he would have gotten all burned up, you know.  His skin would have been, you know, muriatic acid is like, you know, it's a terrible thing.  So, they, they knew he was staying there and they put acid in the pool.  And so, that's why I'm saying that when he got to St. Augustine and that's when he called my dad [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] and he came and, and drove with him down to South Florida.
Speaker 1: I know there's a book about a visit by Thurgood Marshall to Florida in the 19--late '50s [1950s] to investigate the murder of a brother here and--I mean, a black man in, in Florida.  I, I got it at home, I haven't finished it but I--there's a--but there's a--I mean, seems like the story of Florida's civil rights struggle is just now being retold, you know.  Like, when some of the other cities like Birmingham [Alabama] and Selma [Alabama], and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, you hear about those but Florida was, you know, or you hear about Rosewood [Florida] and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, there was a lot of Rosewoods.
Speaker 1: Whole town destroyed in the--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so, you know, as a child of that, you know, we still did not see all of those things because there was no national media that spoke on black issues or anything, so you only saw parts of things, you know.  You heard about Birmingham or you heard about this, but you didn't know about Rosewood or any of those other stories, you know, or you hear about Harry T. Moore getting killed.  But it had to have been something really big for it--it had to, you know, have been a major event.  But that stuff was going on all over the place.  So, when we were kids and we were going to the local black elementary school [Campbell Street Elementary School, Daytona Beach, Florida] and then they closed the school when they did the bussing and desegregation and we got--we were going to get bussed down into a place called Samsula [Florida], which was Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK]--known Klan country, and my dad said, "Unh-uh," you know, knowing what--who he was, he was not going to let us get bussed into that part of the, the county.  So, he sent us to Catholic school [St. Paul Catholic School; Basilica School of St. Paul, Daytona Beach, Florida].  And so, we weren't Catholics but they had a discount if you were a Catholic and a discount if you had multiple kids.  So, my dad said, "Well," (laughter), "the three of y'all [Cherry and his siblings, HistoryMaker Charles W. Cherry II and Cassandra Cherry Kittles] are going to Catholic school and y'all going to become Catholics," (laughter).  So, so, we went to Catholic school and because it was in the neighborhood, you know, it wasn't too far away from, from, from where he could get to us from Bethune-Cookman [Bethune-Cookman College; Bethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida], you know, it was within miles.  And so, we all became Catholics.
Story_ID: 648882
Speaker 1: So, did your father [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.]--was he working at Bethune-Cookman [Bethune-Cookman College; Bethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida] this entire time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was working at Bethune (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He had the other, the businesses going?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was, he was working at Bethune-Cookman, that was his main, his main thing.  And, President Moore [Richard V. Moore, Sr.], who was the president at Bethune-Cookman at that time, supported him in the civil rights activities that he was doing, allowing him to do those things.  And that's when he became more involved with that.  And so, the other entrepreneurial things that he did, you know, I think he was one of the first real estate brokers, black real estate brokers in the State of Florida.  And, they had a couple of housing developments in Daytona [Daytona Beach, Florida] that was sort of--during that period where they were trying to have more affordable housing for black people.  And so, the government funded some areas to develop these housing areas.  And he was the broker who sold the houses in that area, and so, there was nobody else but him.  And so, he had the opportunity to make, make a profit off of selling houses to black people.  So, his customer base in just about everything he did were black folks.  You know, the real estate, the bails bondsman, Bethune-Cookman, you know, and so, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] was a natural sort of an offshoot for him because he was always concerned about the plight of black people and what he could do to help improve that.  And so, I think that as kids we were always pressed into duty to do something, because we were all in support of his mission.  So, I didn't know of any other mission but that, you know, as a kid.  But, my brother [HistoryMaker Charles W. Cherry II] and sister [Cassandra Cherry Kittles] and I had our own struggles because of what he did, you know, we were kind of between communities and sometimes we were in the black community but, because we went to Catholic school [St. Paul Catholic School; Basilica School of St. Paul, Daytona Beach, Florida], the black community saw us as somewhat outliers so to speak 'cause we were the rich black kids who lived in the big house on the corner even though we were on the corner one block from the project [Palmetto Park, Daytona Beach, Florida], you know.  We weren't in the project.  And so, all our friends were mostly in that area.  Either they were in the project or they lived in very small houses and they saw us as living in this big house on the corner, you know, which we didn't live in but a quarter of it.  And so, a lot of the adults, they respected my dad, they liked him because he was always fighting for somebody didn't, didn't have the ability to fight for themselves.  But the kids, it was a little different story, you know, we had to fend and fight our way to show that we weren't, you know, some silver spoon kind of kids in the neighborhood.  So, we were always getting challenged, we were always getting pushed around.  We would ride our bikes going to, to the private school and, of course, you know, they had uniforms in those days at the Catholic school, so we got on little green pants and white shirt with the little ties and stuff.  And then you ride through the neighborhood and they throwing rocks at you (laughter), 'cause the kids trying to get on the bus to go public school, you know.  And so, then we get on--get at the Catholic school and then now there were only four or five black families there in the whole school.  So, we get on the playground you got to fight there, you know, 'cause you got to prove not only in the classroom that you're just as good, now we're on the playground and they want to call you the N word or try to push you around or, you know, it's always something.  So, it was kind of like we, we were fighting every which way you turned, you were battling.  So, what that did was, of course, that made us a closer knit family, you know.  My brother, my sister, and I were basically, you know, we'd circle the wagons whenever necessary.
Story_ID: 648883
Speaker 1: So, was there a name for the black community in Daytona [Daytona Beach, Florida]?
Speaker 2: No.  Well, you had a di- couple of different names.  You had Palmetto project [Palmetto Park, Daytona Beach, Florida], which was where we lived, and they used to call it PPU, Palmetto Project University.  So, we lived near Palmetto project.  You had Soul City [Daytona Garden Apartments, Daytona Beach, Florida], you had Cypress Street--let me see--you had one or two other areas that were a little further out, but those were the main areas that we, we would identify with.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, what was the name of your first school?
Speaker 2: My first school was Campbell elementary [Campbell Street Elementary School, Daytona Beach, Florida].  And it was right behind our house, I mean, I could walk out, walk out the door and go a hundred yards and I was at school.
Speaker 1: Okay, Campbell (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And my mother [Julia Troutman Cherry] taught there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, so, you were there how long, from what grade?
Speaker 2: Three years.
Speaker 1: Three years?  Okay, so, first through third?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then we went to--from there we went to St. Paul's Catholic church [St. Paul Catholic School; Basilica School of St. Paul, Daytona Beach, Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay, then St. Paul's.  And that was in the neighborhood too, you say?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was in the neighborhood, it wasn't too far from Bethune-Cookman College, which has now become Bethune-Cookman University [Daytona Beach, Florida], but it was not far from the black community.
Speaker 1: In those first--in those elementary years, were there any special teachers or mentors that came along?
Speaker 2: The black teachers were, you know--since my mother taught there, it was Miss Christian [Doris Christian], Miss Moore [Dorothy Moore], Miss Baker--Miss Barker [ph.], I mean.  Miss Barker was my first grade teacher, Miss Barker.  And then, Miss Moore was my second grade teacher, and third grade teacher was Miss Christian.  And so, when your mom works at the school, you know that, you know, you can't do anything--you can't be a kid.  You got to--'cause your mom is right there, you know, so I couldn't get into the same kind of troubles that the other kids could because my mom was on campus so to speak.  She's down the hall.
Speaker 1: Were you inclined to get in trouble at all?
Speaker 2: No, but, I mean, I wanted to be a kid, you know.  And so, the kids would do things and as kids will.  But, you know, you always knew that your mom was like right there, and in those days, they'd paddle you.  And so, Mr. Dickerson [John H. Dickerson], who was the principal--you had the mostly women teachers and then Mr. Dickerson and maybe a couple of the, the men who were in those roles of administrative or the janitorial services, you know.  And so, you know, the women, they, they were tough too.  I mean, they weren't, they weren't easy on us.  They wanted you to get the work and wanted to, to perform.  But, Mr. Dickerson, if he sent you down to Mr. Dickerson's office, you were going get the ruler.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, he was going to paddle you on your hand or on your knuckles or on your hand depending on which way he felt that day.  But, I tried to stay out of his office because, if I went there, then I got to deal with my mama and then once I get my dad [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.]--once all that was over then I had to go and talk to my dad, you know.  So, I did that once or twice but then after that, that was it for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, my sister [Cassandra Cherry Kittles] was there, my brother was there.  We were all at Campbell until they closed that elementary school.
Speaker 1: So, it was closed when you were in the third grade?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was in the third, Charles [HistoryMaker Charles W. Cherry II] was in fifth, my sister was in first.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, so this is 1966 or so when they closed it?
Speaker 2: It was--have to be--was befo- let me see.  Yeah, 'cause if I'm in the third grade I was probably nine, so, that would be yeah, like '66 [1966], '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, closed to 19--in the name of integration, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 648884
Speaker 1: So here we are in '66 [1966], this is--
Speaker 2: Yeah, around that time (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and your father [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] is, your father is quite a figure here in, in the history of the state of--I mean, around the Daytona [Daytona Beach, Florida] area and in the history of the State of Florida (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and in the state, he was--he, he got around.  You know, I found there were more people that knew him or had come in contact with him that I didn't know because, as I said, when my dad came home he was trying to be dad and he didn't bring a lot of that of what he was doing in.  You had to be very direct in asking him about these things, you know.  And then he would share with you, but as like today, a lot of times we try to shield our kids from a lot of the things that's going on, you know.  And my mother [Julia Troutman Cherry], I remember when I was little, a situation where my mother had packed all the bags and she was, she was going to take us to Atlanta [Georgia], because she said that she felt like he was putting the kids [HistoryMaker Charles W. Cherry II, HistoryMaker Dr. Glenn W. Cherry and Cassandra Cherry Kittles] and everybody in danger.  And she wasn't going to sit here and deal with that.  He could do what he had to do and she was going to take the kids and go to Atlanta.  And so, he had to talk her out of, out of that, you know.  And so, I think that in some ways he didn't want us to know all the things that were going on around him 'cause we probably would've been afraid about it and, you know, and my mom might've felt pressed more to move and go to Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so, now, did--so, you're at St. Paul Catholic School [Basilica School of St. Paul, Daytona Beach, Florida] from I guess fourth grade on.
Speaker 2: Fourth grade to seventh grade.
Speaker 1: So, you were there when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated, right, in school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what, what happened that day and how people dealt with it or how your father and his friends dealt with it?
Speaker 2: Well, it was sort of--those two periods that you remember somebody getting killed was Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] and King.
Speaker 1: Well, we can start with Kennedy then.  That's '63 [1963], now, you're a lot younger then.
Speaker 2: I'm a lot younger but I still remember it because it was such a traumatic--the way everybody responded, you know, when you walk in and people are crying and there's all this going on and you like, what happened, you know.  And so, when they told us that they killed the president, of course, I didn't know really who he was, but it seemed like that was--and that was all that was on TV at the time, you know.  And so, we did have a TV (laughter), we did have a TV.  And so, you know, and I remember seeing the, their son [John F. Kennedy, Jr.] saluting as they were going by with the coffin and stuff, so you kind of remember those periods like that.  And, when King got killed, I remember that during that period of time, school--the things at school got really tensed.  And, you know, it was sort of like at that point where we, as black students, are going to beat up all the white students that we could beat up.  And everybody was telling you don't, don't--you don't want to get involved in the violence--that King wouldn't have wanted you to be violent.  But, you saw all this violence going on around, you know, there was pictures of cities burning, and folks fighting, and you felt like you should be involved.  And, the only way to be involved at that point was to do something like that.
Story_ID: 648885
Speaker 1: Was the church sympathetic, I mean, the St. Paul's Catholic Church [Basilica of St. Paul, Daytona Beach, Florida]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were, you know.  And there was a lot of prayer vigils and a lot of talks and, you know, trying to keep everybody calm.  And, you know, and so, you know, the neighborhood was worked, worked up though 'cause we still had to go back home.  So, I was telling you living in two worlds so to speak.  And, you know, I think that it's amazing as I look back at the fact that we came out of that scenario somewhat balanced, you know.  I, I think part of it was the fact that we saw some good white people.  There were some white people that came through the house that were supportive of the movement, they put money in, you know, they marched.  Most of them were religious folks.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of the names of them?
Speaker 2: No, I don't, but I've seen some pictures.  I think when we get to pictures, there're some pictures of some clergy and some nuns and stuff who were marching along with my father [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.].  And, when they were raising money for the--to take buses to--like, to D.C. [Washington, D.C.]
Speaker 1: For the march?
Speaker 2: For the march.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was people who put money into that.  There were some lawyers who, who worked for my dad, and with my dad when he was filing different things.  There were two guys that were convicted of murder that he, he got out of, out of--off death row.  They found that, that basically they fabricated all the information.  But, there was one of these big white law firms that volunteered the legal power to do that.  So, I saw some good people on both sides, and that helped to kind of balance out the things that I saw and witnessed and heard from the folks who would call the house and--when my dad would be gone with my brother [HistoryMaker Charles W. Cherry II] and they'd go off on a march somewhere and leave me at the house with my mother [Julia Troutman Cherry], he'd tell me, "You answer the phone.  Don't let your sister [Cassandra Cherry Kittles] or your mom answer the phone."
Story_ID: 648886
Speaker 1: Really?  So, so, did, I mean, did your--how did your--did, did your sister [Cassandra Cherry Kittles] and, and mother [Julia Troutman Cherry] follow that protocol, the phone ring, they'd let you answer it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  You know, my dad [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] said, "Let Glenn [HistoryMaker Dr. Glenn W. Cherry] answer the phone. I want him to be doing this stuff while I'm gone."  Because my mother, that's one of the things that worked my mother up about leaving is taking those kind of calls, you know, when people'd (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What kind of calls would you have to field?
Speaker 2: Threatening calls.  "We going to burn your house down, we going to kill you," you know, with the N word.  "We going to kill you niggers," you know, you know, "We down the street."  All that kind of stuff, you know.  And so, it'd make my sister and my mother nervous, and my dad told them, "Don't y'all answer the phone."  He told me to answer the phone.  And, I didn't like it but that was my job.  And, then the other thing was that, you know, I told you my father had guns.  So, he'd take me before he'd get to ready to leave and he'd say, "Here's one, here's another over here, and here's one over there."  He says, "If you see that door--if that door opens and they don't identify themselves, you know, don't let them come up the steps."  And, I was like, wow, okay, you know.  So, that was the kind of responsibility that he was kind of leaving with me, 'cause that's what he told me, "That's why I'm leaving you here.  It's why you can't go with us."  And so, I had a different (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's a heavy responsibility for a young man.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I wasn't a old kid either, I was a young kid.  And so, that always kind of, you know--my brother [HistoryMaker Charles W. Cherry II] had a different thing.  He was out there with my dad and they were being threatened right there on the march.  But, my threat level was different, you know, I didn't see it, it was just, just coming through the phones.  There was a lot of calls, you know.
Speaker 1: Did you--were you instructed to or did you ever alter your voice to sound older, try to sound older on the phone?
Speaker 2: No, he just told me don't say a lot.  So, I'd just say, "Hello."  And, then they'd go on and I'd hang up, and then they'd call back.  So, instead, I'd let it--just let them talk for a while because I was like, okay, maybe they'll get tired, you know, 'cause if I keep hanging up on them, they just keep calling back, you know.  So, I'd let it sit and I'd--so, sometimes I'd just listen to them rant, you know.  And, then they'd say, "Hello? Hello," (laughter) and then hang up, you know.  And I'd say, "Man, there's some crazy people out here."  I'd say, "I understand why he's telling me like, you know, if you--." We had a little chime, a wind chime that was on the door, and so, when you opened the door, it would hit those chimes so you know that somebody was coming in the door, you know.   And so, that would automatically--that was my cue.  And, then my dad would say, "It's us," you know, or, "It's me," you know.  And, like, okay, because I was given my task.
Speaker 1: Was there ever a time when somebody actually did show up?
Speaker 2: No, never, never was a time that somebody actually tried to come through the door but, you know, I'm happy about that.  But, you know, he told me, "There could be a possibility and so, I want you to stay home."
Story_ID: 648887
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you this.  This is--I hope people don't think this is out of left field, but I--just, did you have a dog?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  We had big dogs, we had German Shepherds, we had boxers, you know, they mostly lived outside, you know, around the back of the house.  So, you had--in our house you had two entrances.  You had the back door where you had to come up the stairs and come through the back, the dog was back there.  And you had the front door, which was on the street.
Speaker 1: How many would you have at a time, ty- typically?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the most we had was three and then the least we had was one.  We had one big German Shepherd who was about a hundred pounds, and he didn't tolerate any other dogs being around.  And so, he, he was--his name was Yogi [ph.] and he was--he ruled the neighborhood.  People knew about that dog from far and wide, they were all afraid of him because he was a big dog.
Speaker 1: Now, these--now, I don't know--these are time--I don't know if it was happening in Daytona [Daytona Beach, Florida] but I know when I was growing up one difference from those days and now is that people's dogs would actually roam the neighborhood and you knew whose dog it was.  And you'd say hello to them just like it was a human being (laughter).  And, he'd go back home when he got ready or sit on somebody else's porch, I mean, was it like that, you know what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: Well, my, my dog was actually the, the last one that I'm telling you about--the other ones we had, we had some that were like that.  They were nice dogs, they didn't fight.  This dog was a fighter.  And so, the dogs in the neighborhood, when they heard him out, they would try to go in.  'Cause he was a big dog, 'cause he--
Speaker 1: Was he fenced in when he was out or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was fenced in outside, so--but, he was one of the ones that made me wanna be a veterinarian.  It was a couple of instances that made me lean toward, toward being a veterinarian but--there was a gentleman who lived in our neighborhood who had sort of a menagerie of animals.  He had some monkeys, he had some cats--big like bobcats, he had horses, and I used to walk by and (unclear) house, and we'd all in the neighborhood would go and look at it.  All these animals in his backyard.
Speaker 1: Now, this is a black man?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a black man.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he had all these animals in his yard, and I was like, wow, look at that.  I had never seen, you know, some of these animals, you know, some of these animals we'd never seen before.
Speaker 1: Do you remember his name?
Speaker 2: I don't remember his name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, so, he had a, a horse that he would bring out at Campbell elementary [Campbell Street Elementary School, Daytona Beach, Florida] and tie him to a tree and the kids, we'd go pet him and stuff.  As long as he was around, the horse was nice.  So, once--one day I decided I was going to go pet the horse, he had gone off to get some water or something and the horse was out there by himself.  So, I went up to the horse to start, you know, petting him and messing with him.  And then the horse look like to me got aggravated or something and start--he trying to, you know, horses will try to bite at you, and then I was trying to move away from him, and he was kind of pushing me with his body and whatnot.  And, so, my dog was in this fence, was watching this, and when he saw the horse and me going at it kind of, he jumped the fence and ran that horse all around.  Had him, you know, running around that tree until his head was all up against the tree and the horse was trying to kick him to keep him off of him.  And, I went and pulled my dog off, I said, "Oh, I got a dog right here.  Don't mess with me, you see my dog.  He'll mess you up," you know.  And so we went back and I was like, "That's--boy," I said, "That's my dog right here."  And, then everybody in the neighborhood knew that dog because he did not play.  If you came around on that corner, he would run you on the other side of the street, you know, as long as you stay on the other side of the street, you were cool.  You come on this side or come anywhere around here, he was going to get you.  I'd say he was a hundred pounds with, shaggy--he was a big shaggy dog like a wolf.  So, he was the back door; I was the front door whenever--when my father [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] was gone.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 648888
Speaker 1: So, this is--so, now, as you--are you--you said your mother [Julia Troutman Cherry] helped, helped you with science and math?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And made it possible for you to become a vet, a veterinarian?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she kind of--my interest in science and math she helped to formulate that, you know, she was always encouraging me in, in science and math, you know.  And so, I got strong in that, you know, and I liked being around animals, and I liked, you know, reading about nature stuff and everything, you know.  So, I was a outdoors kind of kid.  Charles [HistoryMaker Charles W. Cherry II] was more inside reading, I was outside, you know.  As a middle child, they let me do more--I was kind of--didn't have the responsibilities that my brother had and then having a younger sister she couldn't go and do things that we could do.  So, I was sort of, you know, I was missing in action sometimes, you know.  They'd look, "Where is Glenn [HistoryMaker Dr. Glenn W. Cherry]?"  "He's out, he's out and about."  Charles is in there reading, Cassandra [Cassandra Cherry Kittles], my sister, she's in the house 'cause, you know, girls couldn't wander at that point.  So, I'd found some guys in the neighborhood [in Daytona Beach, Florida], we'd go hunting, you know, we'd take the dogs.  I couldn't take my dog 'cause he was--he'd be beating up the other dogs.  But, these other guys had dogs, and I saw that they were going out hunting.  And I said, "Yeah, I want to go hunting with you guys," so we had our little pellet rifles and BB guns, you know.  And we'd go out bird hunting and stuff like that.  And that's kind of being out in nature, you know.  I was a hunter at first and then one day, I couldn't find the guys to go, go out and go hunting.  They didn't have the dogs, we used to go rabbit hunting and, robins, and all kinds of things, squirrels, whatever.  And, I couldn't find anybody to go hunting with so I went by myself.  And I went out in the woods and I saw this real giant woodpecker.  And so, I said, "Man, that's a beautiful bird."  So, I shot him, killed him, I put him in my basket on my bike, and I was taking him around trying to find my friends to show them this bird that I shot.  And then I couldn't find anybody, so at the end of the day I was getting ready to go home and I was looking at this bird and he was beautiful, and I threw him in the trashcan.  And I felt like that was such a waste that I killed this bird for no reason, that was just adding to the beauty of the nature, and I killed him.  And I felt really bad about that.
Story_ID: 648889
Speaker 1: So, you didn't know another way to appreciate nature other than to kill it and capture it at that point (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, and to show them to other people, you know.  And so, then after that I started kind of becoming more of, you know, moving away from that to wanting to be a veterinarian, you know.  And I was probably in a seventh grade civics class that I can recall they asked everybody what kind of career would you, might want to have.  And I--we had to do that and I went to the library and, and I said, "Let me find something to find out about what's the highest career that you can do working with animals."  So, I went through the zookeeper stuff and then I saw veterinarians, and I said, "I wonder if black folks are veterinarians."  So, I went to my--we had a veterinarian who we took our dog to, and I went to talk to him about being a veterinarian.  And he told me that it was a difficult thing to do and that I should probably search for something else for a career.
Speaker 1: Is this a white veterinarian?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, it wasn't any black vets.  So, I went to another one who said the same thing, said, it's like, it's too difficult.  And so, I said, okay.  So, I went to the library and I saw where a Ebony magazine issue had something about Tuskegee, Tuskegee Institute School of Veterinary Medicine [Tuskegee University College of Veterinary Medicine, Tuskegee, Alabama].  I said, "Whoa, there, there are black folks who are veterinarians."  And they came out of--most of them--they were--almost all of them came out of Tuskegee.  So, that was my first time, you know, finding out that there was someplace where black people could go if they wanted to be veterinarians.  And so, I wrote that I wanted to be a veterinarian in the seventh grade.  And so, from there I tried to volunteer to work for veterinarians, I said I'd sweep, sweep out the place, I'd clean cages, whatever.  No one would let me work for them.  Because, my dad [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] was in the height of his civil rights thing and so, you know, I couldn't even volunteer anywhere, you know.  So--but I just kept saying that I, I'm going to keep going, you know.  So--but, all that kind of stemmed from my mother [Julia Troutman Cherry] supporting me in this science, math kind of a thing.  'Cause when I read in seventh grade that you had to be good in science and math and English in order to become a veterinarian and so I was like, okay, well, I'm going to keep pushing.  And so, even though I was an athlete, you know, we were all--my brother was a, was a basketball player, I was--I played football, basketball and, you know, wanted to be a college athlete, I was always like the only one of one or two black people taking chemistry, you know, advanced math, you know, biology, you know.  So, when we, we got bussed to another school after St. Paul's [St. Paul Catholic School; Basilica School of St. Paul, Daytona Beach, Florida], I went to a black junior high school, eighth and ninth grade, was called Campbell Middle School at that time or Campbell Junior High [Campbell Junior High School; Campbell Middle School, Daytona Beach, Florida].  So, I went--Charles [HistoryMaker Charles W. Cherry II] went to a Catholic high school, right, from--see, he, he stayed at, at St. Paul's, graduated from there and he went to the Catholic high school [Father Lopez Catholic High School, Daytona Beach, Florida].  I left St. Paul's and went to a black middle school or junior high.  My sister [Cassandra Cherry Kittles] was still elementary, she got--she went to--my mother was teaching like six or eight miles at a desegregated school (gesture), you know, going north from us.  So, my sister went to school where my mother.  So, we all split up at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So then we all had different experiences af- after that, you know.  You know, whereas before we were all together at the, at the, St. Paul's.
Story_ID: 648890
Speaker 1: So, do you think you made the right decision or--I mean, to go to--or that your parents made the right decision to send you to Campbell [Campbell Junior High School; Campbell Middle School, Daytona Beach, Florida]?
Speaker 2: Well, at that point in time, yeah, I think so because I was--I had, had my fill of the two worlds, you know, at that point.  And, and Charles [HistoryMaker Charles W. Cherry II], who then had his maybe a year later.  Because he went on to Father Lopez [Father Lopez Catholic High School, Daytona Beach, Florida], which was a senior high, but he didn't stay but one year then he ended up going to--back to public school.  I, I had a chance--I either had to stay there at St. Paul's [St. Paul Catholic School; Basilica School of St. Paul, Daytona Beach, Florida] or go to the local junior, junior high school.  So, I chose to stay in the community because all these kids that I was with, that I was getting--I was always having to battle with, they were going over there and I said, well, I can go over there and then I may make more friends.  So--and it's close to the house.  So, I went there.  And then my dad [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] didn't have a problem with that, and my sister went with my mom [Julia Troutman Cherry] so he didn't have a problem with that either.  So, it was kind of like, "Okay, everybody's in a situation that I can deal with, you know.  I got Glenn [HistoryMaker Dr. Glenn W. Cherry] in the local black school, Charles is over here at Father Lopez but that's not too far, Cassandra [Cassandra Cherry Kittles] is with mom."  So, I went back and then so, then I had the taste of what it was like to go to a black school, you know.  And that was something different as well, because that's when I found out that the things that I learned in Catholic school, that I took two years earlier, they was, they were teaching in my junior high school.  I, I'd already done that work two years, three years before.  So, it was like, wow, okay.  And then the kids saw me as being like really smart.  I was a nerd because I'd already knew (laughter), I knew this stuff, you know.  And so, you know--
Speaker 1: Did they try to challenge you in some kind of way to give you work that you were--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, they let you skate off of what you already knew?
Speaker 2: I was making A's.  I already, you know, so--
Speaker 1: You must've had a lot of free time to then think of things and use your mind for other things?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I mean, but I was trying to fit in at that point.  And so, I was playing football, I was playing basketball, I ran track, you know.  I didn't know anything about girls until then, you know, first kind of trying to figure out, you know, girls.  Because at, at the Catholic school that was like, you know, like I told you it was only four or five families.  It was probably eight or ten of us there, you know, in all eight grades.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, no, it wasn't like--so, that Campbell school kind of experience was my, you know, my black experience at that point, trying to figure out who I was.
Story_ID: 648891
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, now, where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: Well, then, I--when I finished junior high mostly all of my contemporaries were going to Mainland High School [Daytona Beach, Florida].  And, I wanted to try out for the basketball team, JV [junior varsity], at Mainland because everybody from Campbell [Campbell Junior High School; Campbell Middle School, Daytona Beach, Florida] went to Mainland.  Well, when I got ready to go to Mainland, I went out to try for the team the coach told me, "Cherry [HistoryMaker Dr. Glenn W. Cherry], you can't play here, you're supposed to be at Seabreeze [Seabreeze High School, Daytona Beach, Florida]."  And then I found out--and then my brother was at Seabreeze too because, when they used to do the bussing thing, they'd cut out a block of area.  They'd cut out an area and lift that area and they would go to another school.  Well, this side of the street went to Seabreeze, that side of the street went to Mainland because, when they made the block, you know, so we were on the Seabreeze side.  So, everybody I went to junior high with now went to another school and I went to a different school.  And I didn't know any of those guys or people.  So--
Speaker 1: So, this is a mo- mostly white school, Seabreeze?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was on the beach side.  You could get up on the second floor and look out off the balcony and see the ocean [Atlantic Ocean], you know.  And so, this was all the kids who lived on the beach side, this was their school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, how did you like it there?  That was a--you were another, another fish out of water there I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was trying to, you know, we played against them when I was in junior high.  All the guys I played against and all those folks, now I'm playing with them, you know.  And, Charles [HistoryMaker Charles W. Cherry II] and I were good basketball players, we were, you know, some of the better guys in that--out of that area at that time.  And so, it was, you know, you, you had to readjust now to life back like it was in--when we were in St. Paul's [St. Paul Catholic School; Basilica School of St. Paul, Daytona Beach, Florida], you know, where the balance shifted again to being, you know, 80 percent white, you know, 85 percent white versus when I was at Campbell and it was predominantly black.  So, going back toward--to that, Charles was already over there, so I did have my brother and, you know, some of the older guys that helped me to adjust to that.  But, that's why, you know, and I picked up probably being more challenged at that point as far as academically.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did--were you behind when you got to Seabreeze or were you--
Speaker 2: No, I was probably was back even with the--you know, I was ahead when I went to Campbell, then basically I didn't--you know I progressed some but, you know, if I'd probably stayed in the, in the system I was in then I would've been much farther ahead but I kind of breezed through a couple of years.  But, being a smart kid, you know, when, when challenged I just picked it up again, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 648892
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, my fam- my mother [Julia Troutman Cherry] and father [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.], they believed in doing some homework.  So, you know, you, you weren't going to come home and not do some work.  So, my mother said, "Okay, you want to go to college, you need to start--and you still want to be a veterinarian, you need to pick it up."  So, I stopped playing football, I only played basketball and started focusing a little bit more on being more academic.  And then I ran for SGA president my senior year.  I was on the, I was on the student government association as a member those years that I was there.  In my senior year, I decided I was going to run for the president.  Now, I'm going to be Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] way before Obama (laughter).  So, I ran against a young lady who was not really interested in being president but, you know, her friends had kind of boosted her up to it, right.  And so, she didn't have--I mean, I had platform, I had this, I had that, I was campaigning, okay.  And, she didn't campaign at all.  She won, okay.  Then, right after she won, she moved out of town to another area, so then the vice president who was just her girl, who they were doing this just to do together--as I understand it, they were doing it so they could have something on their resume to go to college, okay.  So, I'm serious about it, right.  So, then the vice president gets elevated to the president and then they come and ask me, would I want to be the vice president, okay.  Because she needs somebody that can move around and move through the school [Seabreeze High School, Daytona Beach, Florida], right, because I was a athlete and I, you know, I was a friendly kind of guy and I could move between the student body.  So, I became the vice president only if I got to be the head of the entertainment committee.  Having been on student government association before, I knew that the head of the entertainment committee had a budget and they got to pick who the band was going to be for homecoming and for prom.  So, at the time when I didn't win the presidency and they wanted me to come back and be the vice president, they didn't think about it I said, "Well, yeah, I'll do it if I get to be the head of the entertainment committee."  And they said okay.  So, I came in and I was the only one with a budget.  So, the band for the prom was black and the band for homecoming was black.  And the black students was like (gesture), "Yes," 'cause, you know, the rock bands that we were going to before were just--they weren't getting it.  You know, and we would have to suffer through, you know, going to the--going there and listening to the music and you couldn't, you couldn't get it.  So, you know, I, I think everybody was happy with my selections 'cause, you know, we had, we had the jams going on at, at the white school, we had the black bands.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  So, all right, so this is 1976?
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is--yep, '75 [1975], '76 [1976].
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, we're going to pause (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, we played basketball.  Charles [HistoryMaker Charles W. Cherry II] and I were both basketball stars and, you know, thought we would go to college and play basketball, didn't happen.
Story_ID: 648893
Speaker 1: What position did you play on the basketball team [at Seabreeze High School, Daytona Beach, Florida]?
Speaker 2: Well, I played--I was a guard, yeah, played, played the two, three, sometimes I played three (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, 'cause you're about 6' what?
Speaker 2: I'm 6'2".  But during that time it was more about technique, you know, I went to basketball camps and everything so I was a student at a--whatever I was doing I was a student of the game.  And so, where I didn't have in physical size, I made up in technique.
Speaker 1: Well, 6'2" is not bad for high school.  It's, it's--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: I don't know how tall the players were on your--
Speaker 2: Well, they were, you know, most 6'7", 6'8".  We had some 6'11" guys, we had some big guys.  We had some real athletes that came out of the community.  You remember during that time most of our community, the athletes were, you know, there were a corps of athletes that played against each other all the time because we lived in the neighborhoods.  And so, when you got out--then, when they spread us out and we went amongst some of the other people who were not as athletic, you know, we would just, you know, we'd put a hurting on them.  I mean, you know, 'cause we were playing against the best guys in the neighborhood all the time, you know, just on pickup games.  So, we all thought that we were going to go on--go forward.  Now, Charles [HistoryMaker Charles W. Cherry II] went on, my brother went on to be a track, track and field guy, a high jumper.  And--but, I got to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and I, I had an offer to go to Tulane [Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana], and my father [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] said, "Well, why would you want to take a partial scholarship here and you got a full academic scholarship at Morehouse where you don't have to play and, if here, you twist your ankle or you get hurt, you may not be able to come back.  And here all you have to do is go to class."  But, all along I didn't know he was politicking 'cause it was all about--you know, he was Morehouse man and he wanted both of his sons to go to Morehouse, you know.  And so, he convinced me that the best thing that I could do for myself was to go to Morehouse, see if I could walk on the basketball team, and be a student.  And so, when I got to Morehouse, you know, little did I know that all the scholarships are already given out and walking on is really, you know, being a walk on is very difficult, you know.  And so, after that first year where a coach told me, "Well, come back next year, you know, you know, I think you could play but I don't have any scholarships left and, you know, we really don't typically keep the walk ons.  Maybe you can dress at a home game but you won't go away."  Well, I was a high school star, I'm not used to that kind of thought that I would be like that so I was like, forget about it, you know.  If I'm not playing--
Speaker 1: What were your stats in high school? What did you do?
Speaker 2: Well, I averaged twenty points a game and, you know, I led the, led the area in steals.  You know, I set a school record in steals.  My team--I took my team, my senior year we went to the regional fi- regional quarterfinals--semifinals, regional semifinals. But, everybody who was out of--the people who came out of our region won the state.  So, you know, so--and I can say that against the best talent that was out there, I had twenty-five points my last game playing against those guys who went on to win the state.  So, I could've played somewhere but it didn't work out like that.  And, I'm glad my father encouraged me to go and pursue the academics as far as, as opposed to athletics.  'Cause I could've been a journeyman athletic guy, you know, trying to find a place to play.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and the Morehouse experience was one of the best things that happened to me.
Story_ID: 648894
Speaker 1: Okay, well, this is 1976--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  Now, Benjamin Mays is still alive, right?  I mean he's--
Speaker 2: No, Benjamin Mays is not there. Hugh Gloster is now president.
Speaker 1: He's the president but Benjamin May- but Mays is still alive though, he's still alive and around (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He's still around, yes, yes, yes.  He's still alive and he came--we got a chance to meet him.  He came back--he's a Omega man [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity].  I pledged Omega and he--my second year he came back and met with all of the fraternity brothers at, at our frat house and so I got a chance to meet him, you know.  And--
Speaker 1: Well, what was he like, what was your impressions of Benjamin Mays?
Speaker 2: Oh, my.  Well, you know, I knew before I met him I felt like I knew who he was from my father [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.], from reading about him, and hearing all these people's stories about him.  I expected that, you know, it was going to be like meeting God (laughter), so my, my anticipation of him--he was just a regular down to earth guy, you know.  He was nice, he spoke--he was an eloquent speaker and he spoke to us and talked about some old times and what, what, what he would expect of us if he was there.  And it was like listening to the master, zen master or something, you know.  And you tried to figure like, wow, okay, what would it have been like to see this guy every day, you know.  'Cause Dr. Gloster was not--people will tell you that Morehouse folks will say that Dr. Mays was a builder of men and Dr. Gloster was building Morehouse as a facility, you know.  Not that he was not concerned with the men that we, we were becoming on campus, but he was in that growth phase of, of making Morehouse putting more buildings on the campus.  And his thing was raising money, and he was doing those things that was building Morehouse as an institution, whereas, I think Dr. Mays at that time was not as, as focused on the institutional development as he was on the personal development of the men that were there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know there are people that really have strong feelings about Hugh Gloster as opposed to Benjamin Mays, but I don't know if--
Speaker 2: And then Dr. Gloster wasn't that inviting of Ben Mays when he left.  He, he didn't like embrace him.  It was like, you know, it's my time and you got to--trying to get out of the shadows of a guy like Dr. Mays.  So, we didn't see him--when he came to campus that time because the fraternity invited him, it wasn't because Morehouse invited him.  So, so, being with Dr. Gloster was different I think, you know.  We saw him as, you know, the, the figure of Morehouse developmentally but I can't say I had a relationship or got a chance to speak very much to him, you know.  And, I, I could tell you though that my days at Morehouse, you know, when I became a--I was a pre-med major and when we came in there were 125 of us that came into pre-med.  At the end of four years only twenty-five of us graduated in four years.  There were some other people that graduated, you know, additional year later or year or two later, but only twenty-five out of the 125 that started graduated on time.  I was the only person that became a veterinarian, and the only veterinarian I know from Morehouse at this time.
Story_ID: 648895
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this.  Now, this is in--so, well, I know there's a couple of figures that are prominent here that I, I can't remember the name- but there's a chemistry professor at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], or at Atlanta U con [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia] that everybody knows (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.  Well, you had a couple.  You had Dr. McBay [Henry C. McBay].
Speaker 1: Dr. McBay, that's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dr. McBay is--
Speaker 1: McBay, McBay is the one.  I've heard about him so much.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dr. McBay was--he was--man that man was--there was some people that were very--you had, you had the math guys had somebody who was like Dr. McBay.  You had, you know, there was one guy in each department who you had to get by if you were going to get somewhere.  And you were going to go through your major and become that person, you had to get by that guy.  And, you know, and some people'll call them the doctor stoppers (laughter), because, if you couldn't get by them, you weren't going to get that, that--to be that doctor that you wanted to be.
Speaker 1: Yeah, McBay is a legend.  Yes, all the black scientists we--we interviewed black scientists over the past four years for the National Science Foundation and so many black scientists whether they were at Morehouse or not can, can have a--they have a story about Dr. McBay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and he'd laugh and smile at you, you know, if you didn't know it, he, he'd just, like you're not going to make it (laughter), you know.  You not going to make it, you know.  You, you better go home and tighten up.
Speaker 1: So, you had him I'm sure?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, we all had Dr. McBay 'cause you had to--you couldn't, you couldn't get around him, you know.  And so--but there was somebody like that just about every department somebody could hold up and say that, that's their Dr. McBay.  And so, I, I ended up, you know, while I was at Morehouse pledged Omega Psi Phi [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity], which was one of the, the, you know, the big things that happened was becoming a fraternity man and all that meant, you know.  Also, you know, most of my good friends, you know, those are the people that met at Morehouse because I felt more of a kindred spirit with them.  Most of those guys were high achieving people, various family backgrounds but they accepted everybody who came in there as, you know, you deserve to be there and we going to all compete.  And, you know, but since it was all men, you formed some relationships that you may not form if you went to a school that was not a all-men school.
Speaker 1: Yes, so, so, here you're not a fish out of water, are you?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  This, this is feeling real comfortable, I'm good.  I'm feeling like almost like it was when I was in junior, junior high, you know, or elementary.  So, we went in and, we went in and out of the water in my opinion about how we lived, which made us--at the end of the day though I think that, that what I was telling you about being more well rounded.  We did not live in any one world totally, you know, and so we learned how to move in and out of these spheres of black and white, you know, 'cause there was very little Latino or, or Asian in our world.  So, it was a black and white kind of world.
Story_ID: 648896
Speaker 1: Okay, now, who--who, were there any special teachers?  Now I know I mentioned Dr. McBay, Henry McBay [Henry C. McBay], he, I don't know if he's--would--you would consider him a mentor or, or not, but, but who, who were your mentors or special teachers or were there any like that, that you remember from Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Well, you had a--Dr. Mapp [Frederick E. Mapp], you know, he was there during that time and you could always go in there and talk to, to those guys.  And, let's see--McBay, Dr. Mapp.  I had a French teacher who was--her brother [sic.] was the mayor of Atlanta [Georgia]--what was his name during that time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I know who--I'm looking at his face and I can't--
Speaker 2: He built the Atlanta airport [William B. Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport; Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Atlanta, Georgia], he opened up a lot of black, black opportunities for people in Atlanta.  But she was very good about talking to you about, you know, what, what the future may hold and what we should be trying to do even when she was supposed to be the French teacher, you know.
Speaker 1: Maynard Jackson (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Maynard Jackson's sister, yes [sic. Jackson's mother, Irene Dobbs Jackson].  And so, I think that probably during that phase of time though I was headed in a different direction.  Like I told you, I always knew I wanted to be a veterinarian.  So, when I asked people or tell people what I wanted to do, there was very few people who could give me any real guidance on that, 'cause it just didn't--hadn't happen.
Speaker 1: Did they try to turn you towards the Morehouse School of Medicine [Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  They tried to tell me I would do better being a M.D.  I was a pre-med major, I was doing good.  They'd say, you know, "Why would you want to be a veterinarian?  You know, you can be--Morehouse men are dentists or M.D.s.  What's this about veterinarian medicine?"  So, they said, "Well, we can't really help you with that. I don't really know what that track is.  You're going to have to try to figure that one out on your own.  If you change your mind though, we can help you get into medical school."  So, I was kind of going along trying to figure that out, and the summer of my third year when I, I contacted Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute School of Veterinary Medicine; Tuskegee University College of Veterinary Medicine, Tuskegee, Alabama] to find out what I needed to do in order to qualify to get into veterinary school and they told me I needed to take some animal science classes, which I didn't have because I was a pre-med major.  So, I said, "Okay.  Well, I'm going to go down to the University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida] and I'll take some classes there."  So, once again now I jumped back into--I'm out of a black college [HBCU] (laughter), back into University of Florida.
Story_ID: 648897
Speaker 1: Was this, this just for the summer or?
Speaker 2: Yes, I needed to go to summer school to get some animal science classes so, you know, you had to have certain classes in order to qualify to get into veterinary school.  You had nutrition feeds and feeding kind of classes or some kind of animal science classes.
Speaker 1: Now, this is the summer of what, '78 [1978] or--
Speaker 2: This is the summer of '79 [1979].
Speaker 1: Seventy-nine [1979], okay.
Speaker 2: So, I went to University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida], I took some classes there.  And this was a whole new environment, I worked at the veterinary school that summer.  There was a gentleman there named Dr. Payton [ph.], all the black students that went through there would know Dr. Payton.  He was in large animal, equine.  And he sort of tried to mentor us all through the, you know, the process of trying to get accepted to veterinary school.  They had not accepted--the University of Florida at that time's veterinary school was maybe two years old when I got there in the summer.  And I was just there for the summer.  And so, they had not had a black student in the vet school in the first couple of years.  So, we were all trying to be in that first group.  And so, Dr. Payton was trying to help mentor us through how to get into the vet school.  And he was an equine veterinarian.  And so, I took to him because I wanted to be an equine veterinarian, I wanted to be an equine surgeon when I first started out.  So, I would say that he helped me and a lot of other students trying to get qualified to--and, and, and get some work experience.  'Cause work experience was very tough, you had to try to have some work experience; and, if you didn't have any work experience, you weren't going to get in.
Story_ID: 648898
Speaker 1: Now, being a equine veterinarian is, I would guess that it's probably fairly lucrative.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's why it's the most difficult (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  With the racing--yeah, the racing industry being the way it is and the way they take care of those horses that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, I mean, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, really difficult.  That's like top notch, high end.  So, of course that's what attracted me.  Why?  Because the Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] thing, my family thing was always about trying to be the best at whatever it is, you know.  And so, I, I wanted to do that.  So, went there, got the classes, went back to Morehouse, and then applied to vet school, didn't, didn't get into Florida [University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida], didn't get accepted at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute School of Veterinary Medicine; Tuskegee University College of Veterinary Medicine, Tuskegee, Alabama] because I didn't know anybody.  I didn't have, you know, I had some, you know, Dr. Payton [ph.] wrote a recommendation and I had one of the local vets in Atlanta [Georgia], who let me volunteer a few days with him, he wrote a recommendation.  But, I was a pretty much an unknown factor and most of the people who got into vet school had been working for a veterinarian for some period of time.  And most of them had some really strong experiences where I did not have that kind of experience.  So, I didn't get accepted to veterinary school.  They offered me to come to the summer program at Tuskegee because they said, "If we look at you and we think that you can make the grade, you come to our summer program and we accept some students out of summer program, and you may still be able to get in."  So, I wasn't, I wasn't going to go.  I told my dad [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] I, I--once again, you know, I told you my basketball experience where I said, you know, "I'm not used to this kind of treatment 'cause I'm used to being a star, right.  So, I don't want to go the summer program, either they can accept me or I'm going to go do something else."  So, my dad said, "Well, you ought to just go to the summer program and see what happens," you know.  So, I said, okay.  So, he's my biggest mentor.  I went to Tuskegee for the summer program.  And, as would have it, that gave me the opportunity to get to know the dean of admissions, his staff, his secretary, and the school, and the people at the school and we took classes.  I performed well but then there was only limited seats that they took out of the summer program, right.  And, they used to do, they used to do it by states.  So, you know, this many seats from this state, this many seats from this state because they were taking--if Iowa needed to put some of their students in, Iowa would pay Tuskegee some money for some seats.  And then they would get a couple of seats.  So, you weren't competing overall for seats, you were competing sort of regionally.  And so, my roommate, who was from Florida, he and I performed almost exactly at the same level through the summer program but he had more experience and he had better connections than me.  And so, we were good friends and we're still good friends, we're best friends, you know.  'Cause we were competing and we said, "One of us is going to get it, you know, and if both of us get it that's great."  But, every day we would go and we'd sit down and it was like anything else, it was a real competition.  So, he got in, I didn't.  So, after the summer program I was like, what am I going to do with myself now, you know.  And so, they told me, "Well, next year, you know, you'll probably get in next year.  You just kind of find something to stay busy and we'll get you in next year."
Story_ID: 648899
Speaker 1: So, just before school started the dean's secretary called me and to- asked me, did I want to come to vet school still.  And I said, "Yeah."  So, then she told me that basically someone had been accepted at another school and decided they weren't going to come to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute School of Veterinary Medicine; Tuskegee University College of Veterinary Medicine, Tuskegee, Alabama].  And the dean [Walter C. Bowie] had asked her to give him three people's files so he could pick somebody to fill that slot.  And she felt like I should get the slot, so she put my file on his desk and that was the only one.  He went off for a meeting and he came back, he saw my file and he says, "Well, I asked you to give me three and you gave me one."  And he says, "Well, I'm going to go back and come back and find me two more people so I can make a choice."  And she said, "I just didn't find them.  I left yours up there 'cause I thought you should be in the class."  So, he came back and he said, "Okay, fine.  Call him and ask him does he want to come."  And, that's really how I got into veterinary school.  And I tell that story to young people 'cause I said, "Look, you know, you, you never know where your help is going to come from," you know.  And I think that my relationship with his secretaries because I was the kind of person who--I was--whether you were the secretary or you could've been the janitor, you could've been anybody, I was the kind of person who would be friends with everybody and respected all the people.  And some of the people that have helped me the most have been the people who have had the least jobs, you know.  It hasn't been always those people who have been at the top that have helped me along my way.  So, I tell my son [Jamal Cherry] that today.  I said, "Don't, don't look down on anybody 'cause you never know where your help is going to come from."  King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] would've been burned in the pool if somebody who was just a regular employee didn't tell him what was going on.  So, if he had not been approachable and been the guy that he had been, he might not have been the King that we know 'cause he would've gotten, you know, his skin would've been taken off when he got in that pool with the acid in it.  So, you know, that's, that's the, the essence of what I, I think that has helped me all along is always been that for me, you know.  My help has come from not on high but from places that where people will look over, overlook.
Speaker 2: That's a good point, that's a real good point.
Speaker 1: So, from there I went on into vet school, I became, I became the president of the veterinary school in my senior year, you know.  I continued on pushing forward for the same things that I learned from my dad [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.], which was always try to get, get something for, for the people, do something for the class, do something for others.  And I think that was just kind of one of those things that was burned into us from, from watching them, his examples all the time.  So, so, you know, I went on through vet school; and when I got out of veterinary school, I decided I was going to try to go out and, and do large animal equine.
Story_ID: 648900
Speaker 1: Before we get you there, I just wanted to ask you about your father [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] in '78 [1978], this is while you're in school.  He founded the Daytona Times, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And this was--and I know you and your brother both played some sort of role because he got everybody in the family involved.
Speaker 2: Yes, everybody was working.  That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was--back when we started the Daytona Times, I would say that everybody got pressed into work.  Charles [HistoryMaker Charles W. Cherry II] went and got some of his friends from school [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and they came back to help start the paper in the summertime.  I was working in sales, my sister [Cassandra Cherry Kittles] was working in production.  She was proofreading and, and, at that time, we had these big machines that you used to type the headlines and it would come out, and then you put glue on the back of it and stick it down on the paper.  And so, you actually had to build the paper and then, if there was a, a word that was wrong, you took a X-Acto knife and you cut the word out and then she'd type the word back in and print it out on this strip again, and glue and we'd stick it in there.  And that's how you built the paper.  And so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, no desktop publishing.
Speaker 2: No desktop, there was no computers.  This was all done by--well, I wouldn't say it wasn't any computers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It actually was computers--
Speaker 2: --but it was a computer, but it wasn't one that--it was like the Tandy, you know, the (unclear) computers, you know, that was high, high quality stuff.  But, you had these print--you just print out these scrolls of stuff and then you would run them through the glue machine and the glue had a wheel and it had glue on it, and you'd push it through there.  And it would put glue on there and it'd be hot and you'd just press it down on the paper.  And every paper that we would make, we'd have to strip--we'd keep the same paper and we'd strip the, the lettering off of it and start all over again, you know.  And so, it was a production, it was a real production.  So, my mom [Julia Troutman Cherry] and my sister worked in that part, my dad and I did sales, and my brother was writing and editing.  And so, that was just the way it was.  And so, I started out--my first sales job was working for my dad and he sent me out--when we first started the newspaper, I said, "Well, you want me to go sell it but what am I selling?"  He said, "Well, here, take this newspaper and tell them it's going to look like this." (Laughter) I was like--I got some newspaper, you know, he got these black newspapers that'll come in that he gets or, you know, subscriptions.  "Tell them it's going to look like this."  I said, "How am supposed to sell something I don't even have a copy of or nothing, I'm just going out here selling."  He said, "Don't worry about it."  He says, "I'm going to tell you where to go and who to talk to, and you go call on them."  So, he sort of--I, I wasn't cold calling.  He would call and warm them up and say, "I'm going to send my son over there," and then I would go and try to finish the sale.  And so--
Speaker 1: And collect the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and collect the money or at least, if I didn't collect the money, then he--I would come back and tell him that they said they're going to give us a check or something here.  And so, I was essentially--that's where I learned, you know--he said, "Your personality, you'd be good in sales."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause everybody was looking around for what everybody in the family would do.  So, I didn't know anything about sales, and what I learned I learned from him and from just doing it, going out and doing it, you know.  And there was many times I tell people that I have, I've had sales--a lot of salespeople work for me, and I'd say, "I know what you guys do because I did it."  There were times when I would go sit in the parking lot because I was so disgusted about getting nos that I'd sit in the parking lot and do nothing and wait for the end of the day, and I'd come in and my dad would ask me, "Well, what did you get today?  Did you sell anything today?"  And then I'd start telling him, "Well, I went by So and So's place and talked to this person and--," and he'd say, "Wait, hold up.  Did you sell anything today?"  I'd say, "Well, no, I didn't sell anything today."  He say, "Okay, well, you can--I got other things to do, get out the office now," you know.  I was like, wow.  But, I was trying.  But, see, trying wasn't good enough, you know.  My dad didn't want to, you know--if you were trying, he didn't want to hear it.  If you got something or you were getting close to closing something then he'd spend some time with you.  And so, I understood then better how to, you know, just from going through that process myself.  And I started trying to figure out, well, how can I, you know--I can't even have a conversation with him unless I got something to talk about.  So, today's young people, they just like to talk.  And I'm like, if you, you got something--are we working on something, we talking about something, we doing something?  We can talk.  But, just idle chatter, my dad was not a idle chatter kind of guy, you know.  And so, as a sales guy that's kind of what became my--my sort of style was.  And I found that, that--I understand that it didn't work totally with everybody, but for a salesperson, you got to understand that you got to get some results.  You can't talk your way around not having something.  So, I learned how to sell by doing.

Speaker 1: Now, were--were you able to go into equine medicine at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute School of Veterinary Medicine; Tuskegee University College of Veterinary Medicine, Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Well, at--when you're in vet school, you're not really allowed to specialize.  You have to do everything.  So, you're going to do small animal, large animal, lab animal, you know.  And so, we, we--you're not allowed to specialize 'til after you graduate.  That was my interest, my area of interest.  And so, you know, my second year, summer of my second year I worked at the Audubon Zoo and I worked in the area where they had the domestic animals.  So, I worked with farm animals as a zookeeper.
Speaker 1: Now, where is the Audubon Zoo?
Speaker 2: That's in New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And these, these were all the humbling experiences that I learned that I did not have contacts, I didn't have the, you know, I didn't have contacts in the veterinary world.  I tried to get into the veterinary office at the Audubon Zoo and the vet clinic that they have there, but I wasn't able to get in there.  Most of the students there are from LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] or they were family, friends of family members of, you know, people who worked there that were got into the vet clinic.  So, I became a zookeeper.  So, at that point in time, I can remember I was--think I was making like $3.50 an hour.  I was a second year going into my third year of vet school, and I was working as a zookeeper alongside people who had little to no education, you know, taking care of the animals.
Speaker 1: Was there something to be learned from doing that?  I mean, as--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I think that--well, I didn't go in with the intentions of being a zookeeper.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I went in with the intentions of trying to work in the vet clinic.  But, when they told me the only thing that they had was the job as a zookeeper, then I felt like I needed more experience working with animals and if I couldn't get anything else, I was going to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay. Any stories about that period of time that come to mind?
Speaker 2: Oh, man.  I was--it was kind of a, a funny thing that during that period of time--like I said, the petting, the petting zoo part, I took care of the goats and the pigs and the sheep and those domestic animals that were in the petting village.  And, that was the first time I got bitten by a pig (laughter); pig bit me on the back of my leg.  And, I was like, okay, I, I'm learning about a large animal and, and domestic animals at this point in time, because I'm from Daytona Beach [Florida], I hadn't been around any, any--well, when I worked at the University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida], you know, we worked in the cattle, we were in dairy cattle.  But, hadn't worked with some of these other species.  And then I found out about really some hard work.  Because the zookeepers build exhibits and whatnot, and we were trying to build a prairie dog exhibit.  Prairie dogs, of course, live underground, so, we had to dig tunnels like the prairie dogs do and, and, and then make an area where there's a dome where we put a clear plastic dome where the prairie dogs pop up or you could look down in there and see what--how, how they were living.  Man, you talking about a summer of digging.  I felt like I never knew that the sun could beat down so hard, that a shovel could, could weigh so much.  That summer was a very humbling summer for me because my classmates came back talking about working in vet hospitals and doing veterinary things.  And I was outside working with domestic animals and digging, and digging tunnels, and, and making this display.  Afterwards, I felt like, well, I, I felt like I contributed to doing something, but that kind of manual labor always drove me on the side that this was probably not going to be what I want to do, you know.  So, that was a, you know, that was a thing where--and I was and still, at this point in time, there was only one or two black zookeepers.  I mean, to be a zookeeper was a status job at the zoo.  And I think the only reason I got it was I was a veterinary student.  So, you know, it was, it was something that at least got me to another place where I could say that I had some experience with animals because it was hard to--for me to get that kind of experience.
Story_ID: 648902
Speaker 1: So, who were, who were--was there any--were there any particular, I mean, instructors at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute School of Veterinary Medicine; Tuskegee University College of Veterinary Medicine, Tuskegee, Alabama] that stand out that you remember that (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Dr. Hall [Ellis M. Hall, Sr.], his favorite thing and it was something that stuck with me all along.  He was a dean of admissions and whatnot, but he--Dr. Hall had this saying he said, "What the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve."  And he used to make us say that all the time, "What the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve."  And, we'd have to repeat that over and over again.  And I believed that, you know, what the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve.  And, Dr. Ruby Perry, who was a--she's still there.  Who was radiology.  She was a nurturing type of person who wanted us to understand the material.  Dr.--we called him Little Ray, Dr. Adams [Eugene W. Adams].  He was very small man, diminutive man, very smart in anatomy.  And he was our anatomy instructor, and so, you know, when we did the anatomy of the horse, the cow, the dog, you know, the chicken, and--Dr., Dr., you know, he was, he was amazing.  Dr. Clinkscales [Jerry A. Clinkscales] who was in small animal, he was the first one that started talking to us about billable hours and the business side of veterinary medicine, you know.  Before that time, when you got in the fourth year and you start trying to figure out, well, how do you make money or how--that's the side that nobody talks to you about.  They talk to you about the medicine and how to be a clinician, but nobody ever talked to you about how to be a good business person and how to make money, you know, as a veterinarian.  And so, Dr. Clinkscales was the first person to meet and start talking to me about that kind of stuff.  And there was one other man, Dr. Jones, Dr. W.O. Jones [William O. Jones].  He was a--his specialty was clinical pathology, hematology, you know.  That man was brilliant, you know.  He didn't have notes, I mean, he'd come in and he teaching the book like out of his head.  He just come in and start talking.  And, he'd put the slides up there and show you stuff, and, mean, it was just, to me, you know, to see someone talk hours about some material and don't have to have any notes, and just going through the book.  Almost like you, you following the book and he's just talking, you know.  And so, and he was a very personable guy, I loved that doctor, Dr. W.O. Jones.  He was, you know, he was a, a mentor to me in more than one ways.  Because at that point in time is when I became a Mason and he was the worshipful master at the, at the Masonic temple there in Tuskegee [Alabama].  And so, he was that to me, and he was also a Omega man [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity] and also a veterinarian, and, you know, all these different things that saw myself being.  And, so, he was a good role model, you know, very nice guy.  So, those were all my kind of mentors.  And then Dr. Padmore [Cuthbert Padmore], who was over large animal, and, you know, his knowledge of horses was amazing to me.  And the funny thing about it, Dr. Padmore was probably about three hundred pounds, okay.  But, in his earlier years he was a jockey (laughter).  And we used to laugh about that and say, I couldn't imagine seeing Dr. Padmore up on a horse, you know.  But that's what started him in veterinary medicine, he was a jockey and wanted to be a veterinarian and then, you know, started that direction.  But over the years, you know, it was just impossible to see him as a, as a, as a jockey but we used to just laugh about what happens to us over the years.  But, those were some of the people that I think as a veterinarian that helped me to understand more about that.  Before that time, I hadn't met anybody who had a clue about what it was to be a veterinarian.  So, meanwhile back at the fort, my family side of the house, we're moving through still newspaper and I'm all the time still involved with the family businesses while I'm still pursuing my own dream of being a veterinarian.
Story_ID: 648903
Speaker 1: So, well, tell us about graduation from--you, you received a D- the doctor of veterinary medicine--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in 1984, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so, I mean, what was (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, at that time I tried to go out to--before the summer of my senior year, I went to work for a equine surgeon out in Chino, California, white guy who--because I was the president of the veterinary school and I got a chance to go to one of the national meetings at the western, western conference meeting of veterinary medicine [Western Veterinary Conference], I met him out there and asked him could I come out and work for him in the summer time and do a preceptorship.  So, he did, he let me come to his practice and, you know, I got a chance to see what life as a equine surgeon would be like.  And, found it very, very, very difficult to get into that field.  It's much more difficult than I would thought, you know, I know that it's like cracking the--that glass ceiling kind of thing, you know, at that point in the '80s [1980s].  And, you know, he, he was very much a stickler, a stickler for, just got to be exact, you know, it's just right or, you know, he wouldn't let you do surgery.  And he never let me do surgery, he let me watch surgery, you know, or he let me hold the instruments while he did the stuff.  Never really let me do anything.  And I was like, wow, well, maybe one day I'll get a chance to actually do something, but it didn't happen.  So--and then he told me, well, that's just the way it is, you know.  And so, I got a chance to watch a lot of surgery but I didn't get a chance to do any surgery.
Speaker 1: Did you--I mean, I don't know.  I'm listening to you, it seems as though a lot of opportunities that, that would've helped your career and like didn't, didn't really happen.
Speaker 2: It didn't pan out.  I got there but I didn't really get there, you know what I mean?  I was there, I was in the room but you didn't really--you know, because it was still that thing that was there--there was still that, you know, you kind of the first person in the room and they're not sure (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) First African American there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you're the first person--African American in the room and we're just really not sure whether or not we should let you do anything.  You're in the room, you should be happy with that, you know.  And so, I never, you know, I wasn't really satisfied through all these opportunities that I was able to forge a way in but it didn't really pan out the way that I thought it would.  I worked for a guy named Scott Traphagen, Dr. Traphagen [Donald Scott Traphagen], really nice guy.  He was a--had a harness track in South Florida and he let me ride with him for a while during that summer and went out, same kind of thing.  You could be around, you know, but even simple things like wrapping legs, you know, wrapping a horse's legs that, that people who don't have a veterinary background would be doing, they didn't trust you to do, you know.  And so, when I rode with Dr. Traphagen I told him that I wanted to work with horses and he told me, he said, "Look, you seem like a nice enough kid and I'm going to be honest with you."  He said, "You could come here and work for me and, you know, see my clients and they'll let you do some work.  After a while you'll get to do some work," he said, "and then you're going to get to be where you want to go out on your own."  And he said, "When you go out on your own, they're not going to use you.  My clients are going to stay with me and the people you may get are going to be the no payers and the slow payers.  And eventually you're going to get tired of that and you're going to leave."  He said, "I've seen it happen before."  He said, "But I never seen a black guy," but he says, "but I can tell you this," he says, "I would think it'd be, it would be very difficult for you to do this."  So, you know.  And he says, "I'm not being racist I'm just telling you I know the people back here and I know what it's like."  And then he also told me, said, "You're a single black guy. That's difficult, you know.  It's a lot of white females in the horse game and that's not going to be something people are going to like to think that, you know, that you're, you're around that."  So, I was like, "What?"  You know, I thanked him for it--that, his honesty.  Because, you know, and everybody won't tell you what's really, what's the word, you know.  So, but he told me that and, you know.  And I could see it on my own, nobody just said anything.  I could see it though.  So, when I got out I tried to--when I graduated out of vet school [Tuskegee Institute School of Veterinary Medicine; Tuskegee University College of Veterinary Medicine, Tuskegee, Alabama], I went out to Oklahoma to work with a, a black gentleman in large animal.  And--I can't remember--Dr.--I can't remember his name right now, escapes me.  But, we--I didn't stay long, I was out there a couple of months with him--
Story_ID: 648904
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were getting more hands on experience working with (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well, kind of sort of but not really.  It was like once again, it's, it's kind of, know, it's--and that's why you don't hardly see too many black equine guys.  It's just a very difficult thing to, to navigate unless you come from a family--like if I was an equine guy, my son wanted to be an equine guy, you know.  'Cause then he could fall in behind me.  But, when I went out there with him, essentially, he had had a mixed practice.  He was doing equine and some cattle work, and some dogs and cats.  So, when I got there, he wanted me to be there so that he could do all the equine work so he didn't have to do the other stuff.  I came out to do equine.  So, what happened was he, he, he did acupuncture and laser therapy.  And that's why, one of the things I wanted to learn 'cause this was kind of new in the mid-'80s [1980s] that people were doing that.  And so, he felt like though he was paying me, he wanted me to be at the office.  So, while he would go out to Ruidoso Downs [Ruidoso Downs, New Mexico] or go work on quarter horse, racing quarter horses or doing his thing, I was at the office.  If a horse came in, leave it to him.  I did the cattle and the small animal work.  And that's not really what I came to do.  So, once again I was in the room in sort of away, but not really where I wanted to be.  And so, ended up after being with him a couple of months we couldn't work that out to my satisfaction so I went, I went to the [U.S.] Air Force.  During the time when I was in vet school [Tuskegee Institute School of Veterinary Medicine; Tuskegee University College of Veterinary Medicine, Tuskegee, Alabama], the Air Force had come on campus to recruit and they were looking for veterinarians to go into a public health--be public health officers.  It was their first wave of veterinarians that they were going to put in this program in the Air Force.  And so, eh, I was like, eh, 'cause, you know, they kind of come around, you know, (gesture) be all you can be kind of a thing.  And you can travel and you can see the world.  And I was kind of interested in that.  So, I went through those, those--that time put in an application and whatnot.  But, then in the meantime, I went on to, to try to pursue the equine stuff.  Well, when that didn't work that well, they called me and say, "Hey, would you like to come to the Air Force 'cause we got a spot for you."  I said, "The only way I'm coming in the Air Force is if I'm overseas.  You guys get me a overseas assignment, call me back."  So, about a few weeks went by, I'm still struggling with the large animal, not doing horses thing, they call me back and they said, "Well, we can put you in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.  How would like that?"  I was like, "Where is that?"  (Laughter) So, I had to go look it up on the map.  And then the people started telling me about it and I said, "Hm, that doesn't sound like that'd be a bad place to be for a while," you know.  And I'm kind of really frustrated with this battle that I been going through trying to get where I want to go.  And so, I decided I'm just going to, you know take a break.
Story_ID: 648905
Speaker 1: So what, what was your role in the Netherlands (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, then I went to--I went in the [U.S.] Air Force and I was the chief of public health services, and I cross trained in public health.  And so, in 1984 I went into the Air Force.  I was a captain in the Air Force, got trained at Brooks medical hospital, Brooks Air Force Base [Texas], which is now closed.  But, that's where they were training for public health at that time.
Speaker 1: So, you were stationed in the Netherlands then?
Speaker 2: I was stationed in the Netherlands, I left, I left San Antonio [Texas] and went to the Netherlands.  And I was based at Soesterberg Air Base, Wolfhounds.
Speaker 1: Okay, Soesterberg, how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Soesterberg, S-O-E-S-T-E-R-B-E-R-G, Soesterberg.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: S-O-E-S-T-E-R, Soesterberg Air Base.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, I was the first public health officer that they had at that base.  And so, that was my get out of the house, get out of the U.S., go see another spot, you know, just vacate the premises.  I just, you know, wanted to see something else and see some other part of the world.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, how long did you serve in the United States Air Force?
Speaker 2: I was in the Air Force four years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, 'til '88 [1988]?
Speaker 2: Eighty-eight [1988], yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  And--
Speaker 2: Just short of four years, it was a little less than four years maybe.  But, you know, at that point in time I went in '84 [1984] and got out in '88 [1988].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, now, you stayed in the Air Force reserves [U.S. Air Force Reserve] for a while.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I stayed in the reserves until '91 [1991] after Desert--'til first Desert Storm [Operation Desert Storm].
Speaker 1: Okay, 'til '91 [1991], okay.
Story_ID: 648906
Speaker 1: Any highlights in your stay in Soesterberg air force base [Soesterberg Air Base, the Netherlands]?
Speaker 2: Well that was a real eye opener, you know, being out of the country for the first time.  You know, meeting people who were lifetime, kind of [U.S.] Air Force, military kind of people.  The training that, that I went into as a public health person, you know, learning occupational health and public health as far as the human side of health goes.  And, the other side was the wartime readiness stuff.  And I became the chief of the decontamination team for chemical, nuclear, biological war.  And I thought it sounded really good and it was really interesting until we start actually practicing.  You know, we went for the training and all that, that, that was great, you know.  I thought this is really something to know.  And then when we did our first exercise and we had on our chem suits and all this gear--and if you've ever been in that kind of a situation to put on that gear, I can understand that, you know, when you got to places like Iraq and Afghanistan and stuff, that stuff is hot.  You will burn up in that kind of gear.  So, I was in the Netherlands and it was not really known to be, you know, that kind of temperatures.  But, what I found out was that this was not where I wanted to be because, when you're the chief of decontamination, you're outside in the environment.  If there's a chemical war or a biological--you're outside because with my job was to make sure that everything that was going into the hospital got decontaminated.  I was connected to the hospital as a public health officer.  So, if there were people, materials, food, water, whatever, that goes into the hospital, it's got to be decontaminated.  So, somebody's got to be outside in that environment to make sure.  And the triaging that has to be done so, if you come in with a bullet wound and I have to look at you and see whether or not I think that you can survive the decontamination, you know, protocol that we're going to put you through picking you up and scrubbing you down and all that, will you survive and get into the hospital so we can even treat you.  So, you know, that was kind a little bit for me, reminded me of that dead bird that I had 'cause I'm looking at you and saying, "He's not going to make it.  He's got a sucking chest wound, he won't make it, he won't live long enough.  Put him over here," you know.  And so, we put you over there and let you die.  And that was the reality of that situation.  And I said, "I don't want to be outside, I don't want to be the one that has to do this and I don't want to be out here in it," you know.  So, then I took another course on--wartime surgery course so that then if--I was going to be inside doing surgery so I wouldn't have to be outside, you know, doing what I was doing.  So, it was some interesting pieces like that, that I can tell you that, that kind of made me know that I don't think that this one was for me.  So, I went from Soesterberg to Izmir, Turkey [Izmir Air Station] and I worked two years in Izmir.  And that was during the time when Gaddafi [Muammar Gaddafi] got bombed in Libya.
Story_ID: 648907
Speaker 1: Right, when Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] bombed Libya?  Yeah, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  So, I was in Izmir [Izmir Air Station, Izmir, Turkey] at the time.  And the base that we had there was not a base with gates or it wasn't a--it was a--buildings, we had a few buildings in town.  And so, that was when they started putting planters out in front of these facilities and stuff to try to harden them a little bit so that people just couldn't drive a truck up in there.  But we were really exposed during that time, there was really no protection in the areas that we were working in.  And so, as much as we would walk around and not wear your uniform until you got to the building, and put on your uniform then or your try to stay around and take your uniform off if you were going into town or whatever, but still the people could identify you as an American, you know.  But, most of the people there were very nice.  I never had a problem in Turkey.  I remember when I first got off the plane there, when I landed there and, and I saw people walking around with, with, you know, AKs and M16s and stuff, and I was like, "Okay," (laughter) at the airport.  I said, "Okay, this is real, you know, where am I?"  And then I got out and we got our bags and you walk down the plane onto the tarmac, there's no, you know, there wasn't like what we're used to now.  You got off the--you got on the tarmac and you had to identify your bags before you got on the plane and you had to identify them when you got off.  And they'd just go--you grab your bags and--the first night that I got into town we rode the bus in and I'm looking out of the window and we're riding in a bus, and I see people with what looked like horse drawn carriages.  And we're talking '80s [1980s] now, you know.  And I'm thinking, I thought we were out of the horse drawn carriage age a long time ago.  So, it was like, you know, it was different, you know.  And then the call to prayer five times a day and hearing that, you know, in the beginning.  And the first day I got there, the next day they had a earthquake.  I was in the hotel and the room started shaking, and I'm sitting on the bed and, you know, meanwhile, from the first day of coming in I'm telling you I'm wondering like where and I, where did they drop me into?  You know, what country am I in 'cause this looks like some third world stuff then the earthquake.  So, didn't destroy the building or anything but that was an interesting time.  And I learned more about myself being in that area, you know, and--'cause I was way away from everybody at that point.
Speaker 1: So, how long did you serve in Turkey?
Speaker 2: Almost two years.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, did, did you learn some Arabic?
Speaker 2: No, a little Turkish but you know Turkish of course is different than Arabic.  But, you know, a little Turkish enough to get around.  And, you know, the Turkish people were very nice people.  I, I'm so glad that we are friends with them 'cause, you know, they are very, very hard, you know, very hard when it comes to fighting and--but really loving people.  Like when they're you're friends, they're your friends but I wouldn't want to fight against them, you know.  So, I, I, I got to get a chance to see, you know, what their lifestyle was like of the Muslim, Islamic lifestyle.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it, and I didn't ha- I don't have a problem with it, personally, to tell you the truth.
Story_ID: 648908
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now, you came--so, so you came back in 1988; and now what did you do in '88 [1988] when you came back to the states?
Speaker 2: Well, '88 [1988] when I came back--well, I got married in '87 [1987].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To my college sweetheart [Valerie Rawls Cherry], we got back together and, you know, and decided we were going to get married.  So, I got married in '87 [1987] and then came back in '88 [1988].  And '88 [1988] was a interesting year because that was the year we started the first radio station [WPUL Radio, South Daytona, Florida] in that fall.  I didn't have a job when I got back.  The guys who were overseas in the [U.S.] military told me, "If you going to get out of the service, don't separate from out of the country.  Go back first, get a job and then get out."  I was like, "Ah, man, I never had a problem getting a job, I'm not worried."  Well, I got out and came home (laughter), no job.  And I found out at that point in time that unemployment for military people was shorter than unemployment for anybody else.  We had thirteen weeks of unemployment if you were military and twenty-six if you were non-military.  I couldn't understand that.  I said, "How can you be--how you treat military people like that," you know.  But, I guess they thought we could get a job quicker than anybody else so our unemployment was not as long.  I went to New Orleans [Louisiana] area 'cause my wife was then working in, in that area.  And I didn't have a license to practice in, in Louisiana. I had a license to practice in Georgia.  So, it was either go to Georgia and work and be separated as a newlywed or stay there and, you know, and try to get a job there and work off unemployment for a while.  So, so, it so happened that during that period of time I got a offer to work at a racetrack in Maryland [Delmarva Downs; Ocean Downs, Berlin, Maryland].  So, boom, I'm back into the horse game, I'm back, okay, that's good.  I can get--so, I went to Maryland to try to get a job at a racetrack there.  Well, there was some politics involved with me getting on there because this was not a practice job, this was a state job working as a, a state veterinarian for the State of Maryland.
Speaker 1: For the Maryland Racing Commission, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  So, there was a guy there that was named Dr. Colvin [Ernest J. Colvin] who was a dentist, he was on the board of the Maryland Racing Commission.  And, Dr. Colvin wanted to see some black veterinarians involved in the, in the--at the racing commission.  And so, he helped me to get that job.  And it took a lot of work from him.  Dr. Colvin was a great guy, he, he's hung in there, you know, he was a dentist--had a dentist practice in Baltimore [Maryland].  And, he helped me to get at the track, get a job at the track.
Story_ID: 648909
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were explaining off camera that this wasn't really so (unclear)--I mean, you, you worked a summer position at the Maryland Racing Commission and then politics (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I worked at this track in Delmarva, Delmarva Downs in Ocean City [Delmarva Downs; Ocean Downs, Berlin, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Dr. Colvin [Ernest J. Colvin] told me that they had a possibility that they could get, get me in full time at the racetrack as a Maryland state veterinarian.  But, right now I should take the job, the summer job at the summer track and that would allow for him to get me on full time.  So, I left New Orleans [Louisiana] and went to, to Maryland and spent the summer at Delmarva.  Of course, I'm newlywed and had to leave my wife [Valerie Rawls Cherry] in New Orleans.  And so, the living situation got to be a problem because during the summertime when I was working making money, you know, I lived in a little shack that was behind a chicken plant in (laughter), in Delmarva because it was cheap and I could send money home to my wife.  And then, after the summer track was over, Dr. Colvin told me he was running into some difficulties getting me on full time, you know.  And so, some politics that were going on, and that I was going to have to be patient.  So, I had about four months that I was--I had to stay in Maryland to be available in case they called me and said, "Okay, we're ready for you to start."  So, during that time, of course, as I told you I only had a license to practice in Georgia.  I didn't have a Maryland license, so I couldn't practice as a veterinarian.  So, I said I don't want to try to take on a job, a full time position, or somewhere that's going to be a problem about me having a start date with the commission comes through with the position.  So, I got a job working at UPS [United Parcel Service].  I didn't tell them I had--when I filled out the application I didn't put down that I was a veterinarian, I just put down my college time and, and left it at that.  And that I was in the [U.S.] military.  And so, they hired me to work out at the airport, and we would offload the UPS planes and transfer those packages into the trucks that would take them out in the neighborhoods.  So, I had to be at work at four o'clock in the morning and would work from four to about ten every day.  And, I slept on--a friend of mine, who was a sergeant in the [U.S.] Army when I was in Turkey [Izmir Air Station, Izmir, Turkey] and I met him when I was there, he let me sleep on his floor in his basement and that's where I lived for those four months.  And I used to take the cushions off the, the--his name was Stanley Conyers [ph.], I want you to know it's Stan Conyers.  And he let me sleep on the floor, and I would--I mean, in his basement and, because he had a full house.  He had kids, wife, everything, and so I would pull the sofa cushions off the bed and wrap my, my sheets around it and that's where I slept.  And--until they called me from the commission and said, "Okay, you're ready to go."  So, and once I got a full time job then I moved my wife to Maryland and then, you know, we lived in Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so, so this job with the Maryland Racing Commission with the state as a state veterinarian, so how long did you serve in that capacity?
Speaker 2: Oh, I did that about nine years.
Speaker 1: Okay, I didn't--
Speaker 2: It was a nighttime position.  I was working at a harness track, so when I came back I was working at Rose- Rosecroft Raceway [Fort Washington, Maryland].  And I worked at Laurel racetrack [Laurel Park, Laurel, Maryland], so I worked harness horses I didn't work thoroughbreds.  And beginning when I went in saying I wanted to be in horses, I wanted to do thoroughbreds but, you know, as life would have it, you know, I learned to love the standard bred horses and trotters and pacers, you know, as much as I like thoroughbreds.  They were a lot more sensible, you know, and stable mentally than the thoroughbreds.  So--
Speaker 1: Now, this is really true that thoroughbreds are kind of crazy?
Speaker 2: They kind of--yeah, they're, they're wound up.  They're high strung.
Speaker 1: So, is that part of their (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think it's part of their, part of their breeding.  Yeah, you know, and standard breeds are--and pacers, the pacers, and trotters, you know, their, their demeanor in order to be in those--to wear the gear and, you know, to pace or to trot, you know, it takes a certain demeanor I think from the horse.  You know, if they got all worked up then they're going to break out of there and start running and, you know, and, and they can't run in the harnesses.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: So, they have to be more trainable and disciplined in some way.
Speaker 2: Yeah, or disciplined than thoroughbreds who take off running, you know, running is a natural thing.  Trotting or pacing is not natural, you know.  It's natural to run.  So, I think that I got great respect for, for the people who work in that business and, you know, and I, I didn't have that until I started working in it.  So, I did that for nine years, but that was a nighttime job.
Story_ID: 648910
Speaker 1: So, I still had my days available to do something, so I worked small animal for a while.  You know, I, I ran a, a small animal clinic for about a year during the daytime and then I would go to the track at night.  And then I went from that to--I worked at the Consumer Products Safety Commission [U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission] as a biologist.  And I did some research for them on sudden infant death syndrome, where we had kids that were dying face down on different types of bedding.  And that was kind of interesting work.  Also, you know, testing products for whether or not they cause damage to the skin, you know.  And that part I didn't necessarily like as much because, you know, we were testing these products on rabbits, you know.  Some of them we'd put it in their eye and some of them you'd put it on their skin to see whether or not it would cause damage.  But, that was for consumer products.  So, I was happy to see the movement go away to less animal testing on those kind of products.  But, you know, I did it for a year.  And the most interesting part though was the pillows, the work that I did with sudden infant death syndrome.  There were a couple of M.D.s who were out at the University of--what was the university?  Excuse me, having a lapse here.  They were doing--they did some research on some pillows that some manufacturers made and said that they caused some of the kids to die.  And so, when that research came out, the manufacturers wanted to sue about that, and so, the Consumer Products Safety Commission decided that they should do a study to see whether or not that would--we could reproduce that and it was done on rabbits.  So, they asked me to go out to see and look at their research and see what their setup was see did I think that we could reproduce it at our lab and, and test out their theory.  Well, what I found out was that these were M.D.s and Ph.D.'s but they weren't veterinarians and they were working with rabbits.  And that the, actually what was making the rabbits die was the anesthesia.  I changed the anesthesia and the rabbits didn't die.  And so, that was a problem that then, you know--I wasn't doing it for the manufacturers, I was doing it to see whether or not we could reproduce the work that said that.  And so, some, somewhat, that, I know research is, you know, is suspect until you can reproduce it.  So, when we did the same exact experiment with the same exact variables and the only thing we changed was the anesthesia, the rabbits didn't die.  So, after that I left the Consumer Products Safety Commission though because I really still didn't like to, to do the job that was there to be done.
Speaker 2: I know a lot of animal advocates, you know, raise a lot of protests--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --around testing of products on animals.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I didn't enjoy that, that much, I mean, it was, it was--that one piece was interesting to me, but the rest of it did not.
Story_ID: 648911
Speaker 1: So, I left there and I went to NIH, National Institutes of Health, and I was in mental health--I was a veterinarian at mental health.  I was at St. Elizabeths Hospital [Washington, D.C.].  Funny thing, I was there when John Hinckley [John Hinckley, Jr.] was there that shot Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan].
Speaker 2: Oh, he was a patient in the hospital?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was a patent at, at, St., St. Elizabeths (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did you meet him?
Speaker 1: Nope (laughter).  Didn't look to meet him.  So, my job was to take care of the lab animals that were there at St. Elizabeths.  Also, the, the monkeys and whatnot that were on research studies that were on the, the main campus and also the ones at Gaithersburg, Gaithersburg [Maryland].  So, I was at the institute of mental health [National Institute of Mental Health], I left St. Elizabeths and moved to the main campus after 'while.  And so, that was another one that I really didn't, couldn't get as comfortable with research, you know, in mental health research.  We--they gave us all of the best of anything that we wanted or needed to, to support the research that was being done on the campus, but in many instances in mental health and they're doing the research you get strokes, you know, 'cause you're working in the brain.  And you get other things that will cause an animal to look like he's, like he's had a stroke.  And, I couldn't really--that was something that I had troubles with as well, you know.  Didn't, I didn't really--I, I liked trying to get the animals back to full functionality but then they go right back on study.  And so, it's necessary research but I just didn't feel like that was someplace that I could stay and be comfortable.  So, I left and NIH and went to--now all along I'm still keeping my night job at the track.  I left NIH and I went to the [U.S.] Department of Agriculture and as a political appointee.  Around that time was when Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] and Al Gore were running for office on a multitrack thing.  We were in the radio business at this point in time.  In '88 [1988] we got our first radio station [WPUL Radio] in Daytona [South Daytona, Florida]; our second radio station [WHYZ Radio; WCSZ Radio, Sans Souci, South Carolina]--
Story_ID: 648912
Speaker 1: That was WPUL [WPUL Radio], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) WPUL in Daytona [South Daytona, Florida], and so--
Speaker 1: Was this the first black radio station in Daytona?
Speaker 2: The first black radio station in Daytona.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, I was involved in that as well as doing the racetrack at night and working a day job.  Because this was family side of the business, you know, and I've always been involved in the family business.  So, working and seeing that happening and then we'd--while I was in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and went over to the [U.S.] Department of Agriculture, was the first time I met John Oxendine [HistoryMaker John E. Oxendine].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At Broadcap, it was Broadcast Capital, Inc. [Broadcast Capital Fund Inc.] that their, their business was to lend money to minorities who're trying to enter into broadcasting.  So, I met John Oxendine and his staff, Victor Brown and some of the other people that were--Rayca [ph.]--who were at Broadcap.  And started talking to them about the fact that we had one radio station and we wanted to kind of expand in the radio business.  So, I'm at agriculture now as a political appointee, because what happened was we had friends who went to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], who worked in the campaign, and during the campaign--this was before I got to agriculture as a political now.  I was still in the--when the Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] campaign was going on I was thinking--I was still at NIH [National Institutes of Health].  So, but, what happened was is that our family helped some of the Morehouse guys who were running the Clinton-Gore [Al Gore] campaign in the State of Florida.  And so, they asked me would I be interested in being a political appointee.  And so, we looked at it and I looked at it and I said, you know, this might be a interesting place and time to be at a place where you may be able to really help affect some policy changes and some things that, you know, could be better for black people, black farmers, all that, right.  So, I decided, yeah, I, I'd like to go.  And so, I got--
Speaker 1: So, the election was the election in '96 [1996] that, that you--
Speaker 2: The election was ninety--first Clinton election was '91 [1991], '92 [1992]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, '92 [1992], right.  Right, so, we're talking about now four years later '96 [1996] election.
Speaker 2: No, I went in the first Clinton election.
Speaker 1: Oh, did you?  In '92 [1992].
Speaker 2: Yes, I was in the first (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I didn't realize that, I thought you were doing these other--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  These other things are like--'cause I'm still at the racetrack but I did, you know, first year was a private practice; then a year of--
Speaker 1: So you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) consumer products safety [U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission], and a year of NIH, you know.
Story_ID: 648913
Speaker 1: You were at the USDA [U.S. Department of Agriculture] then in '92 [1992]?
Speaker 2: Yes, went in '92 [1992] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So, I went in there with the first Clinton group.  So, that was in Bill Clinton's [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] first election and Mike Espy was the secretary through--so there was a gentleman named Charles Duncan [Charles A. Duncan] who was my mentor at that time.  James Day [ph.] was my class, classmate at Morehouse who was working--he and Chris Colley were working advanced work for Al Gore.  They were on Al Gore's advance team.  And so, many of the things that were set up that they had to set up events, they were on the advance team and so that's where we were able to help them with getting some of these locations setup to get things done that they needed to get done to bring those guys in.  And so, being from Florida, we knew a lot of people.  We helped them out and so they were successful and, and went into the--James Day went into the--as a political appointee.  And so, he and I, you know, kind of kept in contact.  And that's how I got a chance to be a political appointee.  So, I went in working for Charles Duncan.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is--is this the lawyer, Charles Duncan [HistoryMaker Charles T. Duncan]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's a different--
Speaker 2: No.  And, really it was dad's--dad [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] had the relationship as well with, with some high level folks in the Clinton thing there.  And so, we--so, I told him I'd like to work in agriculture, so, you know, I, I went into agriculture.  While I was there at ag, I was the assistant to the administrator of APHIS.  And I didn't know what APHIS does, they, they basically--where most people see APHIS is when they come back in from outside of the country.  They're to protect the borders of the--U.S. Agriculture, Animal, Plant and Health Inspection Services [sic. U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service].  So, you know, if anybody is coming back in from outside of the country and they're bringing in fruits and vegetables or meats or whatever, you know, APHIS makes sure that the--that we protect basically the borders inside the country from, from diseases externally and, and we also regulate a whole bunch of other things that, that were APHIS, animal welfare and, and a lot of other things, veterinary services, you know, plant protection.  Lot of pieces come under APHIS.  So, I was a assistant to the administrator of APHIS, and during that period of time I got a chance to go over to the White House [Washington, D.C.] and work as a--in the Office of Presidential Personnel for Charles Duncan.  He was at agriculture and he went over to the, to the East Wing of the White House.  So, during that period of time they needed additional help, they rotated people through to, out of, out of the departments.  They would rotate people in like six months at a time to work in the--to assist in the, in the East Wing.  So, I spent six months as a--in presidential personnel as a search manager with Charles Duncan.  So, that was a different time, I was in the White House for that period of time.  Chance that I was standing out back one day and with some other guys, lunch time, and Bill Clinton came--he was coming out of the West Wing coming over to meet with some people in the East Wing where most of the time they, you know, have the little meetings with people.  And he was coming up the back step and he had two of the security guards with him, two of the [U.S.] Secret Service guys were behind him.  And he came up the steps and it's three of us black guys standing out behind on the back there.  And he comes up, "What's up guys?"  And then he want to kind of jab, you know, and, you know, we like looking like no, we not going to play with the president 'cause these--back there you see, you know, (gesture) (laughter).  And like, they looking at you like, okay, don't play with the president, okay.  But, he was really cool, you know.  Got a chance to see him and Al Gore coming in and out of the building and both of them were pretty down to earth kind of guys, you know.  Clinton was more funny, Al Gore had dry humor kind of, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, they'd stop to talk to you.  They seemed like they enjoyed being around the young guys, you know, and it was kind of hip to be with us too, you know.  A few of us hanging around, you know.  So, so, that was a nice little period of time that, that six months that I was in the White House.
Speaker 1: So, what year is this, the six months that you're actually in the White House?
Speaker 2: Oh, wow, let me see.  That's probably, maybe '95 [1995].
Story_ID: 648914
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Ninety-five [1995].  Okay, this is the year before the second election [of President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now this is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I went out--the second election I came back to Florida and did a few things on the reelect out in in that time.  I came back to Florida to Tampa and worked with the local office here on the reelection.  And, that's kind of where we were--at this time we had two radio stations looking at getting a third one in Tampa.
Speaker 1: Now, did--what (unclear) role did Broadcap [Broadcast Capital Fund Inc., Washington, D.C.] play in this?
Speaker 2: Broadcap gave us financing for the, the station purchase in Tampa.  They had the station in Greenville [South Carolina] and so they wanted to try to get rid of the station in Greenville, and so they said, "Hey, look, if you guys take that Greenville station off our hands, we'll finance you more money for the Tampa station."  So, WTMP [WTMP Radio, Egypt Lake, Florida] was a traditionally black station that we all listened to whenever you came to Tampa.  It was, you know, it was the only black station in our--when we were coming up in Central Florida.  So, everybody knew about TMP.  So, when I saw that they had an opportunity to buy TMP, you know, I thought, wow, I, I'd love to do that.  So, all along while I'm doing these other things and Charles [HistoryMaker Charles W. Cherry II] is doing something different, we're all looking at broadcasting to try to figure out was this going to be a, a thing that we wanted to, to do.  So, we--
Speaker 1: Now, meanwhile, your father's [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] got the, the Daytona Times, he's got a Florida--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we got the Florida Courier.  He had the Florida Courier and also, at one point in time, we owned the Capital Outlook which was a newspaper in Tallahassee [Florida].  And--in the state capital.  And he had a DeLand [Florida] paper that was merged into the Daytona Times.  So, we had multiple print going on and we had the WPUL [WPUL Radio, South Daytona, Florida], and we had the Greenville radio station.  At that time it was WHYZ [WHYZ Radio; WCSZ Radio, Sans Souci, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: So, your father's not wasting any time while you all are doing your careers, he's, he's going too.  He's doing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no. Yeah, and, and part of it is the fact that, you know, we're playing some role along with him with this and--but we're doing it from, Charles is in Fort Lauderdale [Florida].  He's handling some of the, the stuff that's going on with the--and then I was handling some of the programing.  So, I ran across people who were trying to teach me how to program the station, you know.  And so, then I would send down information to them to tell them this is what I want you to do as far as programing goes.  So, he was working with the sales side and making sure that the stations were making money.  And we were working on programing and, and some of the other things that had to be done. FCC [Federal Communications Commission] stuff, Charles would handle anything legal.  And so, he and I worked on programing together.
Story_ID: 648915
Speaker 1: So, now, when did you start serving as general manager of WTMP [WTMP Radio, Egypt Lake, Florida]?
Speaker 2: Okay, so then after I left--what happened was that when we got to a place where Tampa [Florida] looked like it was going to be--going to happen.  That was like in 1997.  And Broadcap [Broadcast Capital Fund Inc., Washington, D.C.] said, "We're going to be able to fund you guys to buy that radio station."  So, they said, "But the only way we're going to do that is if you are going to move down there and take this on to make sure that this happens.  Because we don't like to give our money to people who are not actually operators."  So, I said, "Okay, well, I'll move there and operate the station to make sure that we're able to pay back this loan."  So, I left [U.S.] Department of Agriculture and, well, really I moved--I, I got--I was trying to figure out how I could get to Tampa, you know, living in New York [New York], I mean, in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]  What happened was they had a outbreak here in Tampa of the Mediterranean fruit fly, medfly outbreak.  And so, so happens that the, the department that I'm in and they're under USDA APHIS [U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service] was responsible for the eradication of the medfly.  So, I went to the secretary, the undersecretary, the undersecretary that I was in and that was over APHIS, and asked, could I come to Tampa to work with the medfly program.  So, he at first told me, he said, "Well, that's more plant and you're a veterinarian."  Well, then, as it would happen, they were dropping malathion to kill the, the fruit flies and in Tampa had the largest concentration of ornamental fish in the country.  And they were dropping it in the fish areas and it was killing off the fish.  So, they then said, "Well, you can go down there and help with that.  Try to see if we cannot kill off the whole ornamental fish industry in the State of Florida."
Speaker 1: Yeah, by ornamental fish you mean the fish that people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) People buy, and their fish tanks, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, you know, they had some of the biggest farms just south of Tampa in the country.  So, I came down to work with those fish folks to try to make sure that we could target their farms and make sure that we didn't, we didn't hit them with all these, you know, pesticides.  So, that gave me the ability to come to Tampa.  So, while I was down here working with that, you know, this, this radio deal was going forward so went it came to, you know, that, that we signed the paperwork and stuff then they asked me to come back to D.C. because we were finished with our work here.  And I told them I'm just going to get out, you know.  So, I'm here, you know.  I got everything kind of set up, I'm not going back.  So, I resigned as a political appointee and took over the job as general manager of the radio station.
Story_ID: 648916
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this is '97 [1997], right, 1997?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, now, the, I know the next big thing that you--well, let's--well, you said, now, you were getting advice on how to be a, a general manager and--
Speaker 2: Yes, you know, I think that all this time talking with my father [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] and that I had been a manager as a military officer, I managed people through every program that I worked as--in the government, you know.  So, I had managed people before, you know, and processes and trying to get to a point to where, you know, we, we were successful.  So, I wasn't new to--I'd, I had management experience from the time that I got out of the [U.S.] military--from going into the military, you know 'til that point, when I was at the racetrack, you know, I had at least fifteen people that worked for us there, you know.  So, I didn't have a management problem.
Speaker 1: Well, what was--maybe I should put it like this.  What was--was there a--what was the toughest part of managing a radio station versus some other kind of industry?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the biggest thing was, when you take over a station that was losing money--when I came in the station [WTMP Radio, Egypt Lake, Florida] was losing about $200,000 a year.  And I had to figure out, how was I going to turn this around that we could, you know, get out of this hole immediately.  And so, you know, I think that was really probably the dynamic.  You know, I had to make some cuts and then I had to increase he revenue.  And so, I got on the street and started selling and start trying see if I could make the kind of contacts that would get us back to a place where the station had been before.  The station had basically been--had its ups and its downs.  And the people that owned it before I got there were some football players and their wives, and the wives were running the station but they weren't really broadcasters.  They just, just, you know, needed something to do.  And I think that's how they kind of ran it.  And so, the--actually the guys decided this is not going to work, we need to get out of this business and then they sold the station.  So, the station was not being run in a manner that would make it profitable so inside of a year I'd turned the station around.  The station was making a profit and that then is history as they say.  Because once I started making a profit, then I started becoming seen as a real operator.  And people started saying, hey, that, that guy knows what he's doing, you know.  The station's turned around, it's getting ratings and revenue is up; and, you know, they started seeing me as a--somebody who could potentially be a player in the industry.
Story_ID: 648917
Speaker 1: So a question I have, 1997, WTMP's a AM station, 1150 on the dial, successful station at one point but the--all of the co- urban contemporary stations--I don't know what the clientele was for WTMP [WTMP Radio, Egypt Lake, Florida] but they're all, you know, turning to--they had started turning to FM in the '70s [1970s].  So, how did you make a AM station profitable and what was the format, and what were you selling?
Speaker 2: Well, TMP was a very unique property.  There were a few like that in the, in the country where those stations had been in the same format for all of their existence and that there was no competition on the FM side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The population of Tampa [Florida] was such that the, the black population was 10 or 12 percent.  So, I don't think that any of the--and there were only three broadcasters on the FM side, Clear Channel [Clear Channel Communications, Inc.], Cox [Cox Communications, Inc.], and CBS.  And for the big size sticks that they had, the big signals that they had 50,000 watt, 100,000 watt signals, it was too much signal to service a small population that was mostly in town.  So, they couldn't see pointing these big huge signals that can go fifty, sixty, eighty miles to service a community that's, you know, mostly in a twelve mile radius.  So, I think that was part of it.  So, when there was no real competition, then there really wasn't anything but TMP and, and it was known, and most people grew up listening to TMP.  If you listened to black music, you listened to TMP whether you were white, black, or Hispanic, you know.  I ran into a lot of white people who said that they grew up listening to TMP 'cause that was their first Motown [Motown Records] experience, you know.  James Brown, all of those people were on TMP.  So, if you wanted to hear that music, that's where you went.  So, when I came to town, TMP's programming needed to be improved.  It didn't have a name recognition problem.  It didn't have a recognition problem with the advertising community, they knew about the station.  So, we brought in 'Tom Joyner Morning Show' and--which hadn't been on the air.  It had been a local mornings.  And that boosted the audience.  And we tried to bring in better quality programming than had been on their previously.  So, that's what made the difference.  And I think that there--you're right, there're not many places where an AM station could do what we did but then we're at--you know, Tampa's a--was a top twenty, twenty-one market and so many of the advertising dollars that were national dollars came to Tampa.  So, when they were looking for African Americans, they had to come to TMP.  They had to overlook the fact that it was an AM because people listened to it, so the ratings showed that we had the audience.  So, it was a quite unusual opportunity.  But, then too at that time, most black owned stations were AMs.  FMs were at the--around that time, when Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] signed the Telecommunications Act in 1996 [Telecommunications Act of 1996], started the run on black stations that were larger stations or FMs, the Telecommunications Act allowed for there to be more concentration of stations in the hands of the same broadcasters.  They went from owning two stations to having eight stations in the market.  So, those people who had decent properties got bought out by the Clear Channels of the world.  And so, then, so, with that consolidation, it left basically the AM players in the market being, you know, small mom and pop owned facilities.  So, we took advantage of that opportunity and the reputation of TMP prior to us getting there, we just tried to bring it back to where it was before FM became king.  So, we were able to do that and make it a community station, and the community supported it.  When I got here, people used to tell me that, if there was a fire, people called the radio station.  If somebody was missing, they called the radio station, they didn't call the police, they didn't call the fire department, they called the radio station.  So, we set out to try to make that happen again where, you know, if it was a--if there was a, a accident on the highway, they called the radio station, you know.  And so, when we were able to, to make that, that mind meld happen again with the community, they took the station on as their own; and that's what made it successful.

Speaker 1: Who are, were some of the--everybody around here in Tampa [Florida] would know who the on air personalities were that--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --that had the, the, you know, the tightest grip with the community.  I mean, who, who, who were some of them?
Speaker 2: There was a gentleman named Big Money Ced, Cedrick Jennings.  He passed away here last year and he was, for the young people, one of the mainstays.  There was--we had another young lady called herself the Queen of the Midday, her name was B.J. [ph.] and she connected with the community in, in her own way as, as the midday personality.  And then there was Larry Steele, who is currently back at the station as the program director.  He was afternoon drive jock in Atlanta [Georgia] at V-103 [WVEE Radio, Atlanta, Georgia] which was a--you know, when I listened, listened to them when I was Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And so, ended up that I got him to come to Tampa and to be the program director.  And so, he brought big city radio sound, he--you know his contacts with the record companies and the artists and all that kind of stuff so we were able to bring a, a larger scale of talent to the market, you know.  And then there was a young lady who came from Columbus, Georgia named Nikki Nicole, and she was on air and also did promotions.  And then meanwhile, you know, as the family thing goes, my wife [Valerie Rawls Cherry] was the first promotions director because I needed to have somebody who could put together packages and could do the things that she has skills at.  And so, my wife was the promotions director.  There was a guy named Lawrence Hires who had been with the station for years, and he was in sales.  He was the sales manager.  So, I kind of harnessed some of the local talent and, and then brought in a few people.  My classmate and fraternity brother, Louis Muhammed, who when we first got the station in Greenville [South Carolina] he was up at the Greenville station [WHYZ Radio; WCSZ Radio, Sans Souci, South Carolina], and I brought him to Tampa to do the operations--be the operations manager.  So, we had a good core group of people and everybody was like between their twenties, twenties and forty year olds.  It was nobody older than about forty, you know.  So, we young, we had a lot of energy, we had ideas, and we didn't know we couldn't do what people might think that you can't do, you know.  Always say it's a AM, well, we didn't act like it was a AM, we acted like we had a stick and we were going to go out here and beat up the guys who had bigger sticks, you know.  So, when we went to do a remote broadcast at a car dealership, we brought big speakers and turntables and balloons, and nobody--we acted like we were just as big as anybody in the market.
Story_ID: 648919
Speaker 1: Something emerged at one time, and I don't know how well it worked, called AM stereo, did you, did you all broadcast (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, AM stereo didn't really catch on that well because you had to have stereo in your car.  And that was a lot of aftermarket--you had to have aftermarket radios because many of the radios that came in the cars did not have stereo.  So, you know, we broadcast in stereo but if your receiver can't pick it up then you'd still only get mono.  But, we were one of the early adopters of streaming.  When the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban, he came out and how he made his money was he came to everybody and asked to sign a contract with him, he was going to stream your station.  He would give you the equipment and all he wanted was a couple of minutes per hour in exchange.  So, I was one of the first groups to sign up with Mark Cuban.  And the Mark Cuban took those contracts and went out and he, he showed that he could do it in a couple of major markets.  And then he sold all of that to Yahoo! [Yahoo! Inc.] or one of the big guys who bought this idea, and that's where he got his first money from, you know.  This streaming where they have so much content that they could run on everybody's radio station who was, who was using his service.  And, he didn't even fulfill all those contracts, he did enough to show that it could be done and then he sold the whole thing.  And that's how he made his money to go and do what he's doing now.
Speaker 1: I did not know that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, we were one of the early adopters of streaming our signal online because once you started streaming online then it was stereo, so there was no difference between my station [WTMP Radio, Egypt Lake, Florida] and the FM stations when you listen to them online.
Speaker 1: So, so, now, you're, you're really you've turned around a AM station, made it a big success and you said that--we were talking off camera and you said that Broadcap [Broadcast Capital Fund Inc., Washington, D.C.] then thought that you might be a good, you know--
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't Broadcap.  Broadcap at that time was on their way selling out.  We paid Broadcap off and then we, we hired a company called BIA [BIA Capital Corporation, Chantilly, Virginia], broadcasting industry analysts who was responsible for taking a lot of groups and, and growing them, you know, to the next level.  So, we decided we wanted to try to see if we could acquire some other stations and not just be, you know, own three AMs.  And see if we could take some of the success that we had done with making these AMs profitable and find some investors to do some other deals.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, at that time, I stopped practicing veterinary medicine because it was, it was too much, it was too much to try to serve two masters, you know.  I was fully into the radio business.  I was still working with the family in print and, you know, it got to be that, you know, when you're working with someone's pet or animal that's a part of their family.  They expect you to be available and, you know, you can't--it's hard to do both, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  So, so, this is--you stopped being a vet in what, what year?
Speaker 2: Two thousand one [2001].
Story_ID: 648920
Speaker 1: And, now, be- the year before that though, you and your brother [HistoryMaker Charles W. Cherry II] founded Tama Broadcast.
Speaker 2: Tama Broadcasting in 2000, yeah, right.  So, when we first got our first funding by this guy named Jerome Fowlkes [A. Jerome Fowlkes], who's a good friend of ours still today, he worked for BIA [BIA Capital Corporation, Chantilly, Virginia], he's a black guy.  They brought him in to try to see if he could bring in more deals from African Americans, right, to--and so, he came on board and we hired their company to try to help us to identify markets that would lend to the type of programming that we were doing or the kind of markets that had certain dynamics that were growing in the South, easy for us to get to, offer some opportunities to own multiple stations in the markets, because what we found out was it's very difficult to have one station in a market.  Nobody wanted to fund one station in a market, they wanted you to have more stations in the markets so that, if one station wasn't doing well, another one may pick it up.  So, what they told us was that we had one station in these markets and that wasn't something that they were interested in.  So, we needed to go out and find some deals and come back and then they would take a look at them, and let us know whether or not they were interested in funding them.  So, the difficulty in, in the broadcasting space was number one, finding a quality deal, and number two then finding the financing to do the deal.  And, and in many cases the number one problem was finding somebody who would do a deal with you.  Many times these deals were done between friends or people who knew each other, and there was no real impetus to do a deal with minorities.  Then they came out with a tax certificate program where they said, if you sell your station to a minority, you can get a tax break on some of the money that you get from doing the deal.  So, then the tax certificate program looked like it was going to help minorities get some ability to get some deals done.  But then [U.S.] Congress killed that program and said it was kind of like unfair because now these big guys who were selling the properties to some minority person get a big tax break, and now the government doesn't get that money.  And so, they killed the tax certificate program which was the only thing that kind of gave us a ability to try to get a deal done.  So, then you had--now you're competing with guys who are better funded, who are, you know, they got friends, you know, and you're trying to get funding to try to get a deal done.  So, if you--it was kind of--it was a very difficult time because, if you wanted to get a deal done, you had to show you had the ability to pay--to get the funding done.  If you wanted to get the funding, you had to show you had a deal.  So, you know, what we did was we had to put our own personal money in.  So, we went to people and we tried to find deals that we felt would either, we could make an improvement through engineering to build a station up or through operations that we could turn a station around, right?  So, then we had to go out with our money and try to find these deals, put our money down, and then go back.  We put together some deals and then we went back to the financing people to say, "Hey, we got some deals, you know, would you guys finance this deal?"  Well, as would have it, there's a, there's, you know, there's always the devil in the details no matter which way you look at this situation.  Now we put our money out, we got a certain term of time that we have to close the deal by, and--but we were able to hold the deal together to present it to someone for financing.  Well, once you did that, the financing people took advantage of us because they said, "Oh, you got your money down now, right.  This deal got to be done in a certain period of time or you lose all your money.  Hm, interesting dilemma you got yourself into there."  So, they drug--they would drag, drag, drag 'til you almost didn't have enough time, that you getting ready to lose.  And then they put a deal on the table that just was not a great deal.
Story_ID: 648921
Speaker 1: 'Cause you couldn't refuse, yeah.
Speaker 2: So, I can tell you that, that's probably the first lesson that, you know, I learned was first if you do a bad deal, you'll never recover, you know.  Because you can't change the numbers.  So, I heard that before I got into it so I did a decent deals on what the price was that we were paying for the properties.  'Cause you said, don't overpay, right.  What I couldn't control was the finance costs.  And, that's when I think that we first--that was in the 2001 timeframe.  So, we got financed by Black Enterprise/Greenwich Street fund [Black Enterprise/Greenwich Street Corporate Growth Partners, LP], private equity deal, which was our first deal that we did along with Textron Financial [Textron Financial Corporation], which was a debt instrument.  So, we got private equity and debt at the same time.  The Textron deal was debt that was based on the income that we were making at TMP [WTMP Radio, Egypt Lake, Florida].  You know, they would lend four to six times revenue, you know, but you (unclear), so what your earnings were after all of these depreciations, right.  So, we were able to get a $2 million loan, debt wise, because the AM station was making somewhere between four to five hundred thousand dollars a month--a year rather.  And, then Black Enterprise said, "Well, you know, this looks like something that we wouldn't mind getting into," so they put $7 million in.  And we started buying our first radio stations.  Well, the deal with Black Enterprise was not--while it was probably not as bad as some of the other things it wasn't great, okay.  'Cause we were getting in with some people who kind of did not know broadcasting themselves, okay.  And that most of the time these, these relationships everybody has to bring something to the relationship.  We bring operational experience and business savvy to do the deal, and you're supposed to bring something other than money, you know, to the deal.  So, didn't really happen that way, but it didn't come apart until later on.  So, in 2001, before the deal closed 9/11 [September 11, 2001] hit just before the deal closed.  And we closed the deal, we bought our first two FMs, one in Tampa [Florida], one in Jacksonville [WHJX Radio].  And, from there we continued to raise money.  We bought, we bought a total of three other FMs in Jacksonville [WSJF Radio, WJSJ Radio and WFJO Radio; WJXL Radio] and three FMs in Savannah [WSSJ Radio, WMZD Radio and WSGA Radio, Savannah, Georgia].  So, that happened all the way through 2004.  So, we bought stations up from 2001 to 2004.
Speaker 1: And the, the one in Tampa was a FM--WMGG [WMGG Radio] that you changed to--
Speaker 2: To WTMP-FM [WTMP Radio, Dade City, Florida].
Speaker 1: And this becomes the new WTMP?
Speaker 2: Yes.  So, we're running them simulcast.  Well, first we tried to run them separately but it didn't work for the money separately so we put them together.  And so, then we sold them as a, as a combo with the same programming.  So, TMP continued to clock on.  We were still doing well in Tampa but the acquisitions that we made in Jacksonville [Florida] and Savannah [Georgia]--because now you're in 2004.  We had hurricanes in 2004 and 2005.  And I don't know if you remember the Charley [Hurricane Charley] and all those hurricanes were crisscrossing Florida for like two years, and that just totally, you know, for like almost eight weeks we were being chased by hurricanes during that period of time.  And it knocked some of the stations off of the air.  There was no advertising going on in the marketplace, it was just, you know, right after we do, you know, the last round of financing.
Story_ID: 648922
Speaker 1: Is it possible to insure your, I mean, to get enough insurance to cover that kind of thing here in Florida (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the insurance people don't really want to pay you, you know.  We had insurance, but the insurances the way they got it structured, you know, it's the fine print that kills you on all these insurance things, you know.  And then after you make a claim they drop you.  So, you know, then you got to go out, and they really got you scrambling after that.  But, yeah, we had loss insurance.  And what they do is they either insure you for the loss or they insure you for the, for the revenue that you would've made.  Then the revenue you would've made is based on some formula that they look back over the last year and try to see what you made during those months.  And so, now you're looking back a year or you have to look at what you had for contracts for that month.  But it doesn't replace, you know, everything that you would've made or, or, or that you lost.  So, we still came out bad.  You know, you got something but you just didn't get, you know--and then the federal government had FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency] but then the FEMA program, you know, was a mess at that time.  And so, you had to jump through so many--
Speaker 1: Yes, it was.  Now, this is the time when the FEMA--the head of FEMA [Michael Brown] was--they were calling for his head because of Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, FEMA was a mess and they had all this talking about these, these things that the companies who were affected by the hurricanes, you could get some money from FEMA.  That didn't happen.  You know, that was a, that was a mess.  So, you couldn't get any relief from FEMA and, you know, and the insurance companies were slow; and it just was a, was a disaster.  So, that kind of put us in a vulnerable position.
Story_ID: 648923
Speaker 1: And, at that time, we had done our last final deal we had done with a hedge fund [D.B. Zwirn Special Opportunities Fund, LP].  And we didn't know much about them, because in 2004, there wasn't a lot of information about hedge funds in 2004.  And this was a new hedge fund that had come to black broadcasters and said, you know, "We want to make sure that you guys have access to cash and, you know, we think this is a space that, that could be very successful for our business.  And we want to be with you for the long term."  That was their line.  And that we can get a deal done fast.  So, the speed at which they did the deals didn't allow for you to really find out who they were until after the deal was signed, 'cause they'd do a deal in thirty days.  And they kept you busy on the paperwork telling you we can get this deal done.  And so, by the time you got the deal done and figured out you were in bed with the devil, you were already in there, you know.  So, that's kind of partly that speed of which we were all moving with, and that we really hadn't hit the, hit the wall with the economy yet.  You know, after 9/11 [September 11, 2001] things were kind of getting softer, you know, through '04 [2004], '05 [2005] and then the hurricanes in Florida it may not have affected, you know, other folks but--so, '04 [2004], '05 [2005] it was, it was softening.  And then it fell off '07 [2007], '08 [2008], you know, it just--it was all the way in the tank by that time.  So, during that period of time, the hedge fund decided that--what we found out was that they decided that the best thing they could do is harvest all their investments as early as possible so that they could reap their money, you know, and that they weren't going to wait.  So, when we fell into a technical default on our loans, not that we owed them any money, now.  We didn't--we weren't behind on paying them.  But they had these little technical defaults in the contract that said, if you didn't hit your revenue numbers, you know, for the quarter then you're in default.  So, during the hurricane months where we did not hit our revenue numbers--no one did--you know, they would allow those bigger guys to readjust their numbers but we weren't allowed to readjust our numbers based on the hurricanes.  So, they put us in a technical default, and doubled your interest rate, they basically called your note early.  It's like they do your house, you know, they just, you know.  And so, you know, "We need our $20 million now," when you just gave it to us not, not too, not that long ago, you know.  So, we had a $20 million loan that called and that was about worth what half the properties was worth.  So, then they basically wanted to take the whole shooting match.  Then they'd take that and they'd sell it for a discount price and they'd still make a huge profit because they're making it off our equity.  So, that's what started, you know, a whole big battle over black radio.  It wasn't just us.  This was done to a number of different people, you know, because they came in to that group of us and talked to everybody.  So, you had--and I can tell you today, Inner City Broadcasting [Inner City Broadcasting Corporation], New York [New York], Percy Sutton, that station's gone.  Sid Smalls [Sidney L. Small], who had National Urban Network [sic. National Black Network] and AURN [American Urban Radio Networks], he had stations, TV stations and radio stations up and down the East Coast, New Jersey, New York.  Sid Smalls, he had a heart attack and died fighting these guys, right.  Percy Squire in Columbus, Ohio lost his five stations.  Us, we lost our nine stations, you know.  It was one of these same hedge fund deals that were going on in that period of time.  So, like, you know, you're talking about four of the, the largest minority owned broadcasters, groups, wiped out.  So, you know, that was a period of time that--and, meanwhile, black consumers, black folks, they didn't know because things were going bad overall.  So, it was hidden in the fact that the whole economy was going down what was happening to black media.
Story_ID: 648924
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know there's a, the story on the cover of Black Enterprise about the battle to save black radio--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --fea- featured you and your brother [HistoryMaker Charles W. Cherry II] on the cover.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, at that time, you know, we were just starting the battle.  We didn't know we were going to end up where we finally where we turned out to be.  But, just somebody--everybody on there lost their properties through one, one of these financing deals.  It wasn't out of, it wasn't out of us not being good operators.  It was out of the fact we could not control the financing side of those deals.  And, once they kind of got control of that then they replaced people on the board.  Black Enterprise [Black Enterprise/Greenwich Street Corporate Growth Partners, LP] ended up essentially, you know, cutting a deal to protect their own interests and, you know, get out and leave us in there with these guys, you know, at their mercy because they essentially got out, you know, but they didn't look out for us.  They only looked out for themselves.  And that's what made it kind of bad, because, you know, we were one company and you're supposed to be bound to look out for the company you're in not the fact that you're looking out for the company that put the investment in.  But, that's what they did.  And, so, at the end of the day we ended up back with the two stations that we started with, Daytona [WPUL Radio, South Daytona, Florida] and the Greenville station [WCSZ Radio, Sans Souci, South Carolina], you know, and we lost the Tampa AM [WTMP Radio, Egypt Lake, Florida] station and all the FMs.  But, you know, there's just a wealth of experience and knowledge that was gained through that whole timeframe that, you know--you always talk about, would you change anything.  You know, of course, I would change a few things but I would never have gotten the knowledge that I have now or be able to share my story with other people.  Because I share it readily, you know, people tell me they say, you know, is it a story of shame that, you know, what happened to you at the end of the day?  You lost your properties, you know, you ended up in a long term legal battle with these guys and, you know.  I don't feel like that, I feel like it's a mission that I make sure that people understand, you know, how these things can happen.  And, you know, and even that bad things can happen to good people, people doing the right thing, you know.  You can get with the wrong people.  And you always tell your kids, boy, be careful of the company you keep, you know.  It goes across the board, you know, in business and everything.  And I think that we lost sight of the fact that everything was going fast in the late '90s [1990s], 2000s, you know.  The economy was rolling, the end of the Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] years you could make money on Wall Street without even having to be good at it.  You know, people were just, you know--we were talking about get it now, it might not be around in the future, you know, but watch what you pay for prices but don't worry about it, you'll make up.  You know, that kind of thought pattern.  And, now I'm a more conservative business guy than I was then, you know.  And I tell my son [Jamal Cherry], don't count, don't count your chickens before they hatch, don't, don't put it in your pocket before you make it, you know.  Be careful of who you do business with because, when times get tough and they will, you'll find out who, who's really built for the long run, you know.  So, I think that this experience has been one that I share with other people, I share with my son, I share with anybody who really wants to listen.  People call me all the time asking me about financing this or doing that deal or, you know, about a radio deal and I talk to them and I, I listen to what they say and I tell them what I think, and I tell them about my experience.  And where things were good and where they got off track.  Hopefully, it may help somebody.
Story_ID: 648925
Speaker 1: What are the future plans for Tama Broadcasting?  Do, do you have--I mean, where do you see yourself going (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, we no longer control Tama Broadcasting.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What they did was they basically--we still have stock in the company but the company is not in our control.  And that they're selling the company off in pieces to pay back the loan to the hedge fund [D.B. Zwirn Special Opportunities Fund, LP], and we don't control any of that process.  So, at some point in time, Tama Broadcasting will cease to exist.  The pieces are being sold off as we speak [by Black Enterprise/Greenwich Street Corporate Growth Partners, LP].  And so, for us, we don't really look at Tama Broadcasting anymore as being anything other than we named it, we founded it, but it doesn't belong to us.  So, we've decided that, you know, we're moving on with the newspapers [Florida Courier and Daytona Times] even though we know the newspaper industry is in flux.  We don't know what's going to happen with the newspaper business.  We continue on with our media properties that we have and try to make that work for us.  And we are sort of starting over again.  But we're starting over as older, wiser, business guys, you know.  I've seen it, done it, and there's some things I'd do over again and some things I'm not going to do over again.  So, I've gotten back and I've started, you know, doing a little veterinary medicine again, you know.  And, we--I enjoy that.  I don't know whether or not I would do it nine hours a day, six days a week again but I enjoy doing what I do because I enjoy people and I enjoy the animals.  And I like doing it now.  So, I think that I will continue to do--have my hand in some form of veterinary medicine but now I think that I don't see--I can't really see where the future of broadcasting is.  I think we all kind of have low visibility as to where the industries are going to end up at.  Online media has clouded that.  I think there'll be some form of online, but people have not figured out how to make money in the online space like you do in broadcasting or in print, you know.  And that's really the problem.  If we could all figure out how to make some amount of money that's comparable to the costs that it costs to do it, we'd shift everything online.  But, right now, I think you got a problem with citizen journalism and that, you know, a lot of the things you see online are just not true.  They're opinion driven stuff and there's really no research being going on because it takes money to do that kind of journalism.  And so, unless you're really ready to dedicate the kind of resources to doing good journalism--it starts no matter what form of distribution you're in, whether you're on online distribution, on the air, in print, on TV, you still got to put the resources in to make sure that you got accurate stories.  And so, that's why this cheap form of journalism, citizen journalism, reality TV, it's all cheap programming.  And so, it's going to run its course at some point in time that people are just going to be, you know, kind of finished with that type of stuff and they want something that they can figure like, is this true?  'Cause right now we spend more time trying to say this is not true and that's not true, and this is a--because, you know there's too much of it out there.  So, where is it going?  I don't know.  But I know I live in the world side of, can you make money at it?  You know, and right now the money is being made but it's being made on rumor and opinion driven stuff.  And I don't know how long that's going to last; and I don't know how much money you can make with it.
Story_ID: 648926
Speaker 1: We always ask this question: what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, my major concern is that I think that we have lost our way when it comes to our ability to influence what people think, see, hear about us.  I think that we've gotten too concerned with the trappings of hip hop and what all that is about, you know.  Being in the radio business I've seen it and I've seen the artists come through and all these things and know that for the majority of them most of them, just like the athletes, they're broke after a certain number of years.  And that lifestyle is not sustainable.  And the things that I knew about coming up was that we were a conservative sort of people, you know, our views were religious based and our financials were we stayed conservative with our money.  And, now, all that has changed.  Now we're the most, you know, most liberal.  And I don't mean liberal in a bad way because people use that conservative-liberal connotation in a way that I'm not using it.  When I say it, I mean we're accepting things that we should not accept in our community.  We shouldn't accept the fact, the fact that people are killing each other in the mass amounts that we kill each other in.  We shouldn't accept that, you know, the kids are not concerned about education, they're more concerned about what they wear, what they drive, you know.  And being, you know, the wildest or having more Instagram pictures or selfies in the mirror with half clothed, you know, and then we wonder why we got all these issues that we got.  But we're allowing this stuff to kind of go around because I think that our community's gotten caught up in that thing of where, you know, we feel somewhat guilty about maybe what our kids don't have so we let them do all these things that they shouldn't be doing.  So, my concern is really not so much about what happens with older folks, it's what's happening with younger people, you know.  'Cause the young people are going to be the ones that are going to be in control.  And there's only a small segment of them that are doing it the way that I think it should be done.  For the most part the bulk of our kids are not finishing school, they're not concerned about, you know, getting a quality education, they're not concerned about getting a good job.  All they're concerned about is having money, not a career, not doing something they might enjoy doing even if they weren't getting paid a lot of money.  All they want is the money.  How much am I getting paid?  I want to get paid, you know.  And I hear too much of that.  So, I believe that the older black folks are pretty much ready to pull over to the side, and they don't really care that much to want to be that caught up and concerned about what's going on with the young folks.  And, and you get tired of fighting with them, you know, because they, they--I, I do--I'm hopeful that they will understand based on what they're going through and that suffering has a way of sharpening you, you know.  In the Bible, there was suffering.  God allowed suffering to happen in order to get people's attention.  And I'm thinking that maybe that this thing that we're dealing with now, that we see the suffering that's going on will produce some awakening for us in the young folks that they got to do better.  They got to do something different, you know, that we can't keep going down this path we're going right now.  So, my concern is for the, for the young people and the opportunities that they going to have, and the limitations that they're going to see.  Because we're not involved in these STEM, STEM careers deep enough--the science, technology, engineering and math, you know.  We're not involved in those places where the future of jobs are going to be.  And, you know, with those limitations what do you have, what do you have to offer?  So, I don't know, I don't--you know.  And, and most of these things take a certain amount of learning, there's a certain level of education that you got to have in order to do these.  You can't just start tomorrow and say I'm going to be there the next day. You're going to put in the time whether you put it in when you're young or you put it in when you're older.  You're going to have to put in the time.  It's not going to come without, without that.  And, with, with the price of education these days going through the roof, and that--have you seen the new stuff where, if your parents got bad credit, you can't get a loan if you need them to get a loan.  Your parents don't have credit, you not going to get the loan.  So, if you're in school and you don't have a job or, if you not old enough to where you can try to establish credit on your own and you're depending on your parents, and it's bad time is hitting and their credit's bad, you're out of gas.  So, then how are they going to make it?  What's--you know, are they looking at that?  Are they aware that that's where we are?

Speaker 1: I think this question I'm going to phrase a little bit differently than w- than how we usually phrase it.  I ask people to talk about their family today, but I'd like for you to talk about your family legacy.  I know your father [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] died in 2004, your mother [Julia Troutman Cherry] is still working and working effectively with the business (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother's still working.  Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: Speak to the legacy of the Cherry family, who's coming along after you and, and--
Speaker 2: Well, my mother is eighty-six.  Her mother [Emma Harris Troutman] lived to 101.  So, I tell her she's young, she still got a ways to go.  She still drives her own car, she lives alone, you know, she cooks for herself still.  She's, you know, she's got a great attitude and she's healthy as, as you can be for eighty-six.  I think that when I, when I look at--so, so there's some--I'm hoping those genes pass through, keep coming, you know, and that I, I can say that I'm still--I still got a ways to go.  My son, who broke the mold and didn't go to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], but went to Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York].  And, he's got a degree in civil engineering.  He was a great basketball player in high school [Tampa Preparatory School, Tampa, Florida], probably could've gone somewhere to play ball but he decided he wanted to have a better educational opportunity.  And he walked on at Cornell, played three years there, albeit, he didn't--he wasn't a starter or anything but just what he did to me was an accomplishment to being one of only two engineers on a basketball team in the Ivy League, you know.  And that--I told him, I said that, you know, I was proud of that fact that he kept his eye on what he wanted to do academically.  Now, he's at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California], he got accepted to Stanford and he's getting a master's in petroleum engineering at Stanford.  And so, I think--and he's going to try to get a M.B.A. either from there or Harvard [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts].  So, he's sort of been my--my father would be proud that the doors that he opened, you know, that his grandson went another level, you know.  It wasn't that he didn't think Morehouse was good. He wanted to go farther than we went, you know.  And so, you know, he thinks that's the Ivy League.  Now, sometimes, you know, we get into discussions about that, about whether or not, you know, is that truly better than being at a, at a black college [HBCU].  But, it's, it's subject for debate.  We say Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] is the Morehouse of the, of the North.  So, (laughter), you know, so, they always say Morehouse is the Harvard of the South but we reversed that.  So, I see, I see that he, he was listening.  He got the message that there're going to be opportunities in certain areas, and he's moving forward.  Charles [Cherry's brother, HistoryMaker Charles W. Cherry II] has two kids.  His daughter [Chayla Cherry], very smart, very bright.  Son [Charles W. Cherry III], same thing, they're both young.  But I think that because they've been around everything the family talks about, they see their cousin Jamal [Jamal Cherry] doing his thing that I can see them being accomplished wherever they go, and they'll decide to make good decisions.
Story_ID: 648928
Speaker 1: And then, but, in this whole thing, they, they're, you know, it's like what you learn at the family table is that they're seeing business every day and operations.  They're seeing what academic achievement can happen.  My wife [Valerie Rawls Cherry] is a Ph.D. in clinical psychology and, you know, so, my son [Jamal Cherry] saw two educated people work hard, you know.  Nothing was given to us, you know.  And my wife and I been married twenty-seven years, and she's been right there every step of the way, you know.  And we parented best we could.  And we tried to parent other than our own kids.  I didn't mention my wife, my wife, she's a chief mental health consultant for Job Corps and [U.S.] Department of Labor.  So, she goes out and she reviews a lot of policies on admittance of students with mental health challenges and, you know, try to accommodate those that can be and those that can't work out, then try to find somewhere else for them to be.  But, she's always been involved with children and kids, and trying to do something to help other kids.  So, we only had one kid but we've tried to help as many as we can.  And, by sharing our stories, what we do for our own kid to them and try to spread that.  If their parents don't have the kind of background, we try to help them to understand this is what you have to do in order to get them in position, and how to keep these kids motivated and moving in the right direction.  So, you know, I think we'll just keep doing what we been doing is trying to raise the awareness of the black community to the challenges that we have as a people for our kids, you know.  Become more global in our perspective in what's going on in Africa and around the world.  Try to show our kids that you're not competing with the kid that's next to you, you're competing with kids that are fifteen thousand miles away, you know, who's sitting in someplace, you know, trying to figure out how he's going to get to America and beat you out of a job (laughter), you know, 'cause he's focused.  And you're sitting here listening to some hip hop and not thinking about--because the person next to you is doing the same thing and what's different between me and him.  No, it's not the guy there that you got to worry about, you got to worry about somebody in another country now.  And so, we have to prepare our kids for what's happening globally, and that's my platform that I see.  I mean, I was a small town, small town guy who got a chance to see a part of what's going on and experience some things.  And I don't think I got all the answers but I can tell you what I know.  And, you know, and from my travels and my work experience, I tell every young person that I meet, you got to raise your game, you know.  'Cause it's no longer a regional or local game, it's a global game.  And, you know, you don't see who you're competing with but that person, whoever it is, is working hard and you're going to have to remember that, you know.  You got to work harder, got to put in the work.  So, I don't really have--everybody talking 'bout work smarter not harder and stuff.  I'm like, you just got to work hard.  Yeah, you got to be smart, but you got to work hard.  There's no way around hard work (laughter).  Do you know a way around it?  Please tell me.  But I don't know anything except to go and get it done, you know.  And most successful people I know work long hours, work a lot of hours, you know.  So, I, I, I think that from my side--my sister [Cassandra Cherry Kittles] didn't have any kids.  So, we only got three kids in our family, and so that's why we try to extend the brand to, you know--and why our mission handed down from my father [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] was to help as many people as you can, you know, from where you are.  And, that's, that's what we're trying to do.
Story_ID: 648929
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything I haven't asked you about that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: You know, I think we probably have hit most of the, most of the highlights.  You know, I got some other pieces in there that it'd take us a day or two to--you and I could laugh about some, some funny stories but, yeah, for the most part I think we probably covered a good bit of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, the last question is similar to--well, it's, it's more personal than family legacy.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: That's an interesting thing.  How would I like to be remembered?  I'd liked to be remembered as a friend, as someone who if you were, you know, you're doing your bucket list and you needed somebody to hang out with you, that'd you say, that's a guy I think I could, you know, could go and we could have some fun and do some things.  You know, I think that's probably, you know, the most important thing, you know.  There's something that our fraternity [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity] says, that friendship is essential to the soul.  And I think that, that is where it begins and ends for me.  That somebody would say that I was their friend, you know.  All of the other stuff at the end of the day doesn't really matter.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: You're welcome.
