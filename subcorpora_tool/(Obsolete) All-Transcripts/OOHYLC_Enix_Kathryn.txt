 Finchum  Today is May 20, 2014. My name is Tanya Finchum along with Alex  Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University, and today we   re in  Hennessey to speak with Kathryn Enix, and this is part of our Oklahoma  100 Year Life Project, so thank you for having us today. Let   s start with  having you tell us when and where you were born.  October 13, 1912.  And where?  At Kingfisher.  At home?  Well, I   m sure that we weren   t. I   m sure we were in the little hospital  there, the doctor, I   m sure. To be honest, I don   t think I heard my mother  say, but there were four of us kids. I wouldn   t doubt that they were all  born probably in the doctor   s small hospital place.  And were you the oldest or the youngest or what?  Middle, middle girl. A brother first and three girls, and I was the middle  girl.  And what did your parents do for a living?  Well, they both were farmers to begin with, and then my dad had a  chance to take a job at a bank because he was pretty alert compared to a  lot of kids his age. He really started working in the bank then.  What did your mother do?  5  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Well, to begin with, she just carried four babies and canned up all the  stuff and really worked in the garden. Then later she started working in  the bank, too, so they both were a couple, and that   s how come they  ended up   instead of working at Kingfisher, they both asked for a little  bank at Omega. There isn   t a bank now, but there was one.  So your mother canned a lot?  Yes. Like I say, there were three girls, and the baby was still young, but  really we used to help, too, with canning most stuff for the fair. We had  a town fair and a county fair and a state fair, and we entered stuff.  So you were in 4-H?  Yes.  Where did you go to elementary school?  I think at Omega.  And then high school?  At Kingfisher, graduated from Kingfisher.  What year?  Nineteen twenty-nine.  And then what did you do?  I went to school in Missouri.  That   s a long way from home.  Yes, but I got a scholarship. Three of us, two sisters and I, three of us  went up there.  What was your major?  Oh, probably back in those days we   d use the word education.  And how long did you stay there?  One year, then went to OU.  6  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  So you graduated from OU?  Yes.  What year?  Oh, one summer, I don   t know,    29,    30. Actually, it was during the  Depression. They didn   t have any graduation exercises, but it came out  in the paper who graduated, you know. They didn   t have any big  program like they do.  Where did you live while you were there?  Oh my. I guess part of the time in what would have been called the  dorm, however for me it was just a house. (Laughs)  After you graduated, what did you do?  Well, I had to do substitute teaching for a while. Then I got a job as a  school teacher in Omega, and from there to Hennessey.  Were they small schools?  Well, Omega was, but Hennessey was already a pretty good school.  So you were in college during the Depression. What else do you  remember about the Depression?  Oh, one thing that we all got hurt from, they slowed down on the county  fair because we were all youth entering stuff, sewing and quilting and  cooking and canning at the county fair, and soon after they kind of did  away with it for a while. They might have had it, but it was on a very  small level.  Did you ever work at the bank?  Yes, every night after school, yes. (Laughs)  What did you do?  Posting machine and the typewriter. We learned all those things, the four  of us kids. We learned all that.  So it really was a family-run bank.  It really was.  7  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  What town was the bank in? Kingfisher?  Well, to begin with, it was Omega. Then, I think we worked part time in  Kingfisher, but I think the bank actually was in Hennessey. I could be  mistaken, but I think I   m right.  What was the house like that you grew up in?  Oh, it was nice, if I do say so. Compared to other kids, we had nice  furniture because we refinished it and repaired that. I know a lot of  girlfriends, if a leg got broken on something, they threw it away. For us,  either Papa or Brother would repair.  Did you have running water in the house?  As far as I know.  And electricity?  I   m sure we did. I don   t remember having hot water. We could have had,  but I   m not sure.  A refrigerator     Yes.     or an ice box?  Well, we might have started out with a ice box, but seems like it wasn   t  very long until we had a thing called a refrigerator.  Did the family have a car?  Yes, in fact, most of the time we had a car and a pick-up because my  brother was getting up, seventeen and eighteen, and he wanted to go. He  had a job doing something all the time. He would repair people   s yards,  or he went out and did farm work like plowing or lifting or something,  farmers.  Well, what were holidays like?  Oh, pretty much the same, except lots of the time on the Fourth of July,  a band would play downtown.  Did Hennessey have a movie theater?  8  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Not that I know of for years, but before Ortman put it in, someone had  tried. They had a movie, but it was just open now and then. I don   t know  who owned it, but it seemed like they kind of had trouble making ends  meet.  Well, were you married?  Yes. I didn   t get married until about twenty-three, and that was old  compared, because many of my girlfriend got married at fifteen.  Well, how did you meet your husband?  Probably a football game, I   d imagine.  And so when did you get married, what year?  Oh, not until   they did a write up in the paper, and I never did ever get a  copy of it. It just said they heard a Hennessey girl had married and said  she was a graduate of OU. I   d like to have a copy of it, but back in those  days, you couldn   t get up in your car and go there and get what you  wanted and back.  What paper, though, the Hennessey paper or the Oklahoman?  Well, Kingfisher put a paper out. If it was really something, it would be  in the Hennessey and Kingfisher papers, two of them.  What was his name?  My husband   s name?  Yes.  His last name was   they called it Enix, but it   s E-N-I-S-E, so that must  be a foreign way of pronouncing it because they always pronounced it  like it was E-N-I-C-K.  And his first name?  Well, I think we used to say Louis, but it was just L-O-U.  Lou? Did you go on a honeymoon?  Oh, if we did, it couldn   t have been more than two days. (Laughs) I  don   t think we did.  9  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Did you have children?  No, I just never did get pregnant, and we were going to adopt one after  we was married for several years. Later he took ill, and he was healthier  for about two years, and so I had to keep working to pay for his expense.  It cost me quite a bit physically and mentally to work and keep him in  here.  So what was your maiden name?  G-U-L-K-E-R, Gulker, G-U-L-K-E-R. My dad was a banker at Omega,  and later maybe at Kingfisher for a while, but later at Hennessey.  Had they moved here from somewhere else?  I think Dad   s people had been farmers for years around Loyal, and  before, seems like she had both that considered themselves English.  Maybe they   d been over here several generations from England.  How long did you teach school?  Oh gosh, probably a couple years at Omega, and then I went to Geary. I  didn   t teach long enough to get a salary like a lot of them did, but by the  time I was going to school, I was working part-time at the bank, so in  time, I worked full-time at the bank.  And what did you do for fun?  Very little, practically nothing. (Laughs) No, because football wasn   t a  big thing then, and basketball was. We might go to a basketball game,  you know, one or two nights a month, not every week. We really had a  good life.  Was church a part of that?  Yes, my folks were always Methodist. Then after I got away from home,  the crowd that I went with went with the   it wasn   t called Colonial.  What was it? I can   t think of it right now. It wasn   t Catholic. It wasn   t  Advent. It was still Christian. I think it was just called Christian Church.  Ours had recently been called Methodist, (now I think that was it) and  the new one was called Christian. They probably all looked alike.  How about music?  Well, we had a piano teacher come in from Canton, I believe, and she  10  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  gave piano lessons I took, and I took some lessons at college. At one  time I had thirty-three piano students, so that   s how I made my living.  They can charge, basically playing per hour. Probably more than the  hour.  Well, did you go to dances?  No. If I did, it wouldn   t have been more than once a year or something.  Well, what did you do for Christmas?  Oh, I think we just really went home, and your grandparents came. I had  a brother, and there were three girls, and I was the middle girl. The baby  girl married someone, and the whole family moved to California. Even  though she   s dead now, her children and grandchildren all live in  California, and we really don   t know them because they never did get  back.  Have any of them lived to be a hundred?  If they have, I don   t know.  You   re the only one?  Well, that I know of, but I   m sure that some of them have. I never  smoked, and I never drank, and so that   s two things I think that made me  halfway healthy, was not smoking and not drinking.  That   s your secret to living so long?  Yes, and being good. (Laughter) I grew up going to church. I guess you  could say no drinking, no smoking, go to church, and go to school, so  that would keep you pretty busy.  Well, what keeps you busy today?  I   m busy here now, and   put these curtains up and dividers. My bed   s  here, and her bed   s over there. When you   re here, you might stay  temporarily.  Do you read very much?  Well, I get the newspaper. The Hennessey paper comes out on Thursday,  and the Kingfisher paper every day, and the Oklahoma City, so I read  the newspapers pretty good.  11  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  When you were younger did you make your own clothes?  No, but in 4-H Club we did. Mostly if I needed something, which I  didn   t much, it was things I made in 4-H Club.  Did you ever go to Oklahoma State for  4-H  Roundup?  Well, that   d be Stillwater. I don   t know why, we stopped at OU better  than we did Stillwater, I   ll be honest. (Laughter) I don   t know, just  seemed like people we knew went to OU, and the kids that grew up on a  farm, as a rule, they went to Stillwater, but I think they   re both good  schools.  Did you have a scholarship to OU?  Not that I know of. I don   t think so, honey.  Just to Missouri?  I don   t think so.  Do you have a philosophy?  Well, I wanted to finish my education and to keep, more or less, to pay  back what I had to spend. Then I taught for several years, and I   m back  here on a visit with a single bed, no room.  Did you get to travel any?  I   ve been to Europe twice. I   ve been to every state. Every state, been to  Europe twice, and on one trip I got to go down into Africa and back up.  Probably I   ve been more than the average person.  What was your favorite?  Of countries? Oh, it   d be hard to decide, honey.  What about states? What was your favorite state?  Oh, of course the most advanced one was California because of their  yards and their flowers, where in Oklahoma we just cultivated our grass.  I   ve had a good life really. Some of my girlfriends got married when  they were like fifteen or sixteen, and somebody had a baby within a  year. Sometimes they didn   t go back to school, and they would have two  or three children then later. We wanted a child, but I never did get  pregnant. We thought about adopting one, and we never did get it done.  12  Finchum  Enix  Bishop  Enix  Bishop  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Bishop  Enix  Bishop  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Now, everything I had, I guess, really would be called a dog. That   s  from some of the girls in the bank. I worked in the bank, so when I quit,  they said,    Oh, Kathryn, we want to give you something to remember  us,    so that dog is supposed to remind me of working in the bank.  And what year did you retire?  Oh, I haven   t ever really done it. (Laughs)  What   s your secret to longevity?  Oh, no smoking, church, no cussing, probably other things, too.  Did you ever think you   d make it to a hundred?  Oh, yes, really, because I have girlfriends that died, you know, young,  but maybe they   d been out all night on a party and been drinking.  What did you do for your hundredth birthday party?  I don   t think I did anything, I don   t think.  Now, when history is written, what do you want it to say about you?  Encouraging everyone to go to school, and cut out smoking and  drinking, and staying all night with a boyfriend. I know a lot of girls,  that   s where they got hooked up, and then they got pregnant, and they  had to quit college.  Education was an important part of your life.  I would say, probably outside of home life, I   d say education because  my folks encouraged us to all go to school. Our dad was a banker. Then  later, Mother went into banks, also, so they both were bankers.  Did your husband serve in the war?  He was in service, but he never did hit the battlefield. He was in Europe  away from me for a long time. He was aboard a train that carried  medical supplies to the troops in Europe, so really he was a pharmacist  on a train for the troops, really.  Did he send you letters?  Oh, sometimes I wouldn   t hear from him for quite a while.  13  Finchum  Enix  Bishop  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Bishop  Enix  Bishop  Enix  Bishop  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Well, when he came back, what did he do for a living?  Well, he got a job in a drug store, and I   d been teaching piano. I had  thirty-three piano pupils, so I probably kept all of my piano kids.  Did you ever have any accidents in your lifetime?  Yes, I about lost this leg and this arm. They thought they were going to  have to cut my leg off, and my arm. I was in the hospital seventy-one  days on account of this leg, seventy-one. It used to still be dark. Is it  dark over there?  A little, just a little bit.  Is it dark?  Yes.  Was that a car accident or a fall?  Car accident.  How old were you?  I was with my sister and her husband. They were in the front seat going,  and I was riding in the back seat, and we had a car wreck. They weren   t  hurt. They didn   t even have a scratch on them. I ended up seventy-one  days in the hospital. They were scared they were going to have to lose  my leg and my arm.  How old were you?  Oh, I bet I was probably twenty-two or something.  Before you got married?  Yes, so I was lucky I got well.  Do you remember your first television?  No, really, no. I remember later going places, and they   d have the TV  on, you know.  Did you ever go to the circus?  Oh, it wasn   t a big thing in my life. I doubt if I went more than once in  14  Finchum  Enix  Bishop  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  ten years. I didn   t know I had so much bidded.  Is there anything left on your list that you want to do?  Oh, I had a home in this town, but I can   t stand up to cook. I didn   t want  a maid or a man to live with me, but I really need to live where they  serve meals, so that   s why I eat my meals here.  If you could go back to Europe, where would you go?  Oh, probably France. I had French language. I   d probably go back to  France. I don   t think my grandfather came. I think my great-grandfather  did. Seems like it was my dad   s grandfather who came. He was dead by  the time I got up. I   ve had a good life, really.  What do you do in a typical day? What time do you get up, and what  time do you go to bed, and     Well, as a rule, I   m not cooped up in a place like this. I have my own  home, but I can   t live there without someone, because why? I got to eat,  so I have to live where they serve a meal at mealtime, so I sleep here and  eat.  What time do you go to bed?  Oh, it depends on whether there   s a football game or some plays on, but  as a rule, I   d say ten o   clock.  And then get up?  What time do I get up? Oh, probably seven, seven thirty. Do you have  some more you want to ask me?  He   s thinking.  Oh, okay. (Laughter)  Do you have something more you want to tell us?  Oh, I   ve had a good life, and I would almost credit it with no smoking,  no drinking, (those are probably the main ones) and probably living a  clean life as far as not cussing and staying out late at night and carousing  around. I   m not a preacher, but I would say I   ve had a good life, though.  For years I played the piano or organ in church. I think one time it was  four years, so whenever they needed me, I filled in. You didn   t get paid  for it. That was all free work.  15  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Enix  Finchum  Did you have a favorite song?  Oh, I don   t think so, honey. Every now and then I   ll hear one on TV, and  I think,    Oh, land, they sang that so many times,    but, really, a favorite, I  don   t. As a rule, my bed isn   t shoved clear against the wall. Usually it   s  out about like that away from my drapes. They should both hang  independent of the bed, so the bed should be pulled out. Now, who   s  over there, now? No, I meant in the other bed. Not the boy. The girl who  sleeps there.  I don   t know.  What   s her name?  I   m not sure.  I   m not sure.  All right, if you don   t have anything else, we   ll let you rest.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  Okay.  It was a pleasure.  I really could say I   ve had a interesting life, a good life. I had good  parents. They told us not to carouse around and not drink. I don   t like to  brag, but I think we had better parents because some girls and boys we  knew, they   d go home Saturday night, their dad was drunk or something.  I think we had a better family.  Thank you.  -------  -------
