 Little Thunder My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is September 24, 2014.  I   m interviewing Nathan Hart for the Oklahoma Oral History Research  Program, Native Artists Project at the OSU Library. We   re at Nathan   s  home in Oklahoma City. Nathan, you come from a prominent Cheyenne  family. Your BS degree is in industrial arts, and economics and  business. You   ve worked in the consulting field; you have a design  company. You are perhaps best known, though, as an artist in wood,  whose decorative wooden bowls have won numerous prizes and  commissions and are handled by several fine art galleries. Thank you  for taking the time to speak with me.  Hart Yes, thank you.  Little Thunder Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  Hart I was born in Marion, Kansas, but I grew up in Oklahoma, in Clinton,  Oklahoma. What   s unique about that story is that my father, he   s a  minister. He   s retired now, but he went to seminary in Elkhart, Indiana.  My mother grew up in Kansas, Marion, Kansas. He was working for the  summer, before he went on to seminary, for my grandfather. My mom  was pregnant, and the doctor told her not to travel with my dad. He  went on up and did the first semester, and I was born in Marion,  Kansas. My mom stayed back with her parents. Later that semester,  Dad came back and got us both. We spent a couple years in Indiana and  then moved to Oklahoma, and I   ve lived in Oklahoma ever since I was  two, my second birthday.  Little Thunder You mentioned your father was a minister. Can you talk a little bit more  about him and your mother, also?  Hart Yes, so my father is a minister of the Koinonia Mennonite Church,  Indian Mennonite church in Clinton, Oklahoma. There were four Indian  5  Mennonite churches in western Oklahoma. My mother   s from central  Kansas, and she is of the Mennonite background. Her family would   ve  came from, immigrated to the United States from what   s probably  current day Russia, Prussia at the time. The country no longer exists.  Her family came here. It was actually the Mennonite missionaries that  settled on the Cheyenne Arapaho reservation in western Oklahoma and  established their churches. My dad and his two brothers were the first of  our community and the tribe to go on to college, and they were  encouraged to go to college by the missionaries. They went to Bethel  College, which is where I went to school, as well. That is the Mennonite  school, college.  Little Thunder How about siblings?  Hart I have two sisters, one older and one younger, Connie Hart Yellowman  and Christina Hart Wolf.  Little Thunder What was your exposure to your grandparents on either side of your  family?  Hart On my mother   s side, I really only saw them a couple times a year when  we traveled up to Kansas to visit. I don   t remember either of my  grandmothers. Both passed away when I was a very young age. I don   t  remember, really, either of those two. My grandfather, which is on my  dad   s side, my dad   s father, I remember him the most. He was also very  active in the church out in western Oklahoma in the Hammon  community. My dad was actually born in Hammon, Oklahoma, so I  remember my grandfather on my dad   s side.  Little Thunder What was your exposure to the language growing up, and Cheyenne  culture in general?  Hart The exposure to the language, although we did not speak it every day in  the house, learned a lot at church because all the church events. The  elders still spoke Cheyenne, so I knew a few words and a few phrases.  We also sang hymns. A lot of the songs we sang were in Cheyenne in  church. My, I guess, exposure that I had was really through all the  church activity and people speaking the language in church.  Little Thunder Your sister   s accomplished beadworker and quillworker. Were there  other members of your family who were artistic?  Hart My oldest sister, Connie, is very accomplished. My youngest sister,  Chris, she did do some beadwork, as well. Our family still has some  items that she beaded, but her talents were in the performing arts. She  was a dancer. She went to University of Oklahoma to their modern  6  dance school. She was a ballerina and a dancer in her younger years.  That really moved her, encouraged her to move into her current field,  which she   s in physical therapy.  Little Thunder What is your first memory of seeing Native art?  Hart Again, I think that   s just through our church activities, and part of it is  how do you define, what do you define as Native art. Certainly a lot of  people think of sculpture and drawings as being art, but a lot of the  beadwork, we grew up with it. A lot of the designs that people had for  their families and then those that just created new designs definitely are  works of art when you look at them, and the color combinations that  they have. That   s what I remember the earliest. I also learned, was  taught how to bead. That   s what our elders did in our church. They  taught all the younger people how to bead. That was my first exposure  with the arts is through beadwork.  Little Thunder Right. What is your first memory of making art?  Hart The making of the art.... When I went through school, I did not take any  art classes, so it   s probably just creating things down by the creek.  Sculpting mud, stacking rocks, doing things with making three-dimensional  objects with twigs was really, I think, the first, I guess.  Actually if you look back on it now, (I didn   t know it at the time) but  look back on it, that was my first artistic pieces that I made were just  playing down at the creek with whatever I found in the area.  Little Thunder So you were drawn to 3D.  Hart Definitely, drawn to     Little Thunder Were you doing     Hart    three dimensional.  Little Thunder    figurative stuff?  Hart Probably mostly abstract, but certainly tried to do figurative items, as  well. I remember at young age, traveling and going up to Mount  Rushmore. Came home, and I was digging in the creek bed on the banks  trying to make human heads. (Laughter) It didn   t work, but it was fun.  Little Thunder No art classes, basically, throughout elementary school. Did you have  any exposure to art in middle school or high school?  7  Hart No, I didn   t. I didn   t take any art classes. I was really drawn towards  mathematics. I took every math class that was available to me as an  elective in high school. I guess how that connects, maybe, with what I  do now, when I moved into college I entered the industrial arts  program. My goal was to be a teacher. I excelled in sports, as well, so  my goal was to coach somewhere and be a teacher. I liked math, but I  also really liked more of the art application towards architecture with  that. Took architectural drawing classes, engineering drawing classes,  and came out of there with a major in industrial arts. Also, I double  majored because I also got a major in economics and business  administration, as well. I think it was really through that work in  industrial arts is where I really focused more on drawings, although  they were practical drawings. I took every woodworking class that they  had available     Little Thunder I was wondering.  Hart    because I had a love for wood, and that goes back to growing up at  the creek. The property that we were on out in the country had a creek  going right through the middle of the property. A lot of what I did was  just playing with the trees and in the trees and dead branches, so that  was my exposure to wood.  Little Thunder Chopping wood?  Hart Yeah, chopping wood. (Laughter) Had a love for it.  Little Thunder And you explained the connection in how you ended up at Bethel.  Hart I ended up at Bethel, I guess, ultimately because it was a school that my  parents had gone to and my older sister was there. I was recruited out of  high school, athletically, to go play with different schools on our  football teams. I chose to go to Bethel because it was a smaller school  and I was a good kicker, and I was being recruited to go kick at  different universities, either to walk on or as a scholarship. I wanted to  do more than kick. I knew I couldn   t do that at a big university, but I  knew that at a smaller college I could just continue playing football for  four more years as a receiver. That   s primarily, I think, what drove me  to Bethel. (Laughter)  Little Thunder You have a little bit of everything. What did you do after college?  Hart Immediately after college, I stayed in the area and coached for two  more years. At that time, it was a part-time job. The other time, I took  some additional business classes, and then I also worked part time for a  construction company, specialized in building passive solar homes. I  8  got to stay in the area. I coached, and that was fun to still be involved in  athletics.  Little Thunder Right. Then from there you got into consulting or     Hart From there   and the primary reason I stayed for two years is because  Melanie, we weren   t married at the time, but we were seeing each other.  She was two years behind me in school. That   s why I wanted to be there  at Bethel for two more years. After she graduated, we moved to  Oklahoma. She started law school. I took some coursework at the  University of Oklahoma and got a summer internship with the  Oklahoma Indian Business Development Center. Towards the end of  that when I was going to go back into graduate school at University of  Oklahoma, one of their staff people left. They offered me the position,  and I accepted it. That was my first exposure with working with tribes  throughout the state, and individuals, starting new businesses. From  then, I   ve always worked in one capacity or another   I   ve always  worked with the Indian tribes, not just here in Oklahoma but throughout  the country.  Little Thunder So when did you first start getting into woodturning? And you might  describe, define it for us, thanks.  Hart Coming out of college, or at a young age because I had spent a lot of  time attracted to design. I said I was in drawing classes, architectural  drawing, engineering drawing. You have some exposure to design  elements by taking those types of classes. I was really drawn to wood.  What I wanted to do, my goal was to be a furniture maker and make  custom furniture, design it and make it. At the young age and not  having a great income, I couldn   t afford all the equipment that you  would need to do what I really wanted to do. I saw people turning on a  wood lathe and making wood bowls and thought,    I can do that,    so the  first piece of equipment that I bought was a wood lathe. Just had the  goal of buying, adding to that and having a complete cabinet-making,  furniture-making shop. I stuck with the woodturning.  Little Thunder Now, you   re seeing these wooden bowls in school, right     Hart Right.  Little Thunder    at Bethel. Is that right?  Hart Yes.  Little Thunder And what was it that just totally absorbed you about the bowls?  9  Hart What I remember as a young age, as well, we traveled, and a lot of it  was through my dad   s work. We traveled out to the Southwest. He  knew people out there, (and his ministry took him that direction, as  well) a lot of pottery makers from those regions. Native people are  givers, so when someone comes to visit, there   s always a gift, usually a  gift that they give. I remember at a young age, people giving me pieces  of pottery when we traveled. I   d keep those, and I   d admire them. Later  on in life when I started woodturning, I kept thinking back to the  pottery shapes of the Southwest, whether it   s a seed pot or some other  functional pot. I felt that this is such a great form to highlight what the  characters are in wood, so if you look at the type of turning that I do, it  does resemble pottery. It does resemble the shapes that you see out in  the Southwest. That is why. Because at a young age, my exposure to the  people and receiving gifts of their creation is what influenced what you  see of the shapes of my pieces today.  Little Thunder What was the first art show that you entered?  Hart The very first show that I did was Art in the Park in Clinton, Oklahoma,  because that   s where my parents are. I think I was happy when I sold  my first piece for twenty dollars. Then I did some other local shows.  When I sold my first piece for a hundred dollars, I was all kinds of  happy, too. Now I can sell some for more than a hundred dollars, and  I   m happy with that, too.  Little Thunder Did you do some of the first Red Earth shows?  Hart I did. Early on, I did some of the early Red Earth shows. It was a local  show. That was really my exposure, I think, to the bigger marketplaces  outside of your small, weekend, local community shows because that  drew artists, not just from across Oklahoma, but there were artists that  came in from out of state, as well. It was part of a bigger festival, nice  big cultural festival, so people came in from out of state. That was my  first exposure to selling art to people outside of Oklahoma.  Little Thunder What was an important prize that you won in a competition early on?  Hart To me, one of the most important ones was a Judge   s Choice Award  that I got because   .  Little Thunder At Red Earth or     Hart It wasn   t at Red Earth. It was actually at the Heard Museum. The way  that is structured is that all the judges, they judge their certain  categories, but at the end they can cross over to another category and  give a special award to another artist. One of those judges did that.  10  That   s really an honor. I had placed before and even placed First before  in the sculpture division, (that   s where they put me) but to receive a  Judge   s Award was really an honor for me, as well.  Little Thunder That was one of my questions because at Native art shows there weren   t  a lot of people doing woodturning. Did you have trouble with  categorization, do you think? Maybe there were some awards you  missed out on?  Hart When you enter, of course, you enter early on in what you think you  should go into. You always have to sign that release that says they can  put you in another category if it fits, so I ended up in sculpture. Really, I  started off in being diverse art forms. In all these bigger shows, they  really started pushing my work toward the sculpture categories, and so  that   s where I reside now is in sculpture, depending on the show. Some  shows have bronze, and all of them have stone as a category. Some  have stone, metals, and everything else, so wood, glass, and the mixed  media are all together.  Little Thunder Do you do a lot of non-Native Art shows, too? How is your work split  up?  Hart Not anymore. I just do all Native art shows. I do two large shows a  year. One in the spring, which is the Heard Museum, (that   s always the  first full weekend in March) and Santa Fe Indian Market in August is  right there about the third weekend in August. Those are really spread  out good. Gives me plenty of time to make my inventory for the next  show. It does take a long time to get these pieces ready. Then I   m  represented by galleries. It so happens that one gallery is in Santa Fe,  and the other one   s in Phoenix. They sell different times of the year.  Phoenix sells great in the winter months, and Santa Fe sells great in the  summer months. That kind of gives year-round sales in the galleries.  Add the two shows in; that keeps me pretty busy.  Little Thunder Typically how much inventory do you try to take? How many bowls  would you try to take to Santa Fe?  Hart I always shoot for in the twenties, but it ranges between sixteen   . I  think one year I had thirty-some pieces that I took out. It also depends  on the sizes. Obviously, if I   m just going to go with small pieces, I can  make more, but if I want to do bigger pieces, it takes a long time. I think  one year we went out with I think just, maybe, ten or twelve pieces to  Santa Fe. That was a challenging year because we had just moved into  the house where we   re sitting now in July, and we also had two girls on  the way. It was a busy year, but that was the lowest inventory that I ever  went to a show with.  11  Little Thunder You have this great business background and even do consulting in that  area. A lot of artists have trouble balancing the business and their  work. Have you had any trouble with that?  Hart I really haven   t, and I feel fortunate that I do have, I think, good  business sense and understand business. A lot of it goes back to  mathematics and accounting classes that I had that really gives me  the   . My business work that I   ve done has really been in the finance  area. It   s all about numbers. It   s all about making sure you reach certain  targets, and ratios, and formulas. I enjoy that, but I do love the creative  side, as well. I get to do both. I   m also a business owner. I run a  business that does embroidery and silk screening on shirts, and I have a  steady client base. I get to create the artwork, do some of the graphic  design on it, but then I always have to do the rest of it, the production,  the orders, and make sure the bids are right, got all the right numbers  put together, as well. That   s fun.  Little Thunder What role does your wife play in your business? I know she has her own  occupation, too, but   .  Hart She does. She has a full-time job, but she definitely checks the  inventory periodically and gives me great encouragement to get back  out to the shop. She   ll sort of follow me out, close the door, and say,     You can   t come back in unless you have a piece with you.    (Laughter)  That   s all joking, but she really does. It   s always interesting because I  have a process. These pieces are all about a process. You can   t just pick  them up and go start to finish on them. I work them about 90 percent  and then have to let them dry. They   ll warp, they   ll move, and then I  finish them off.  I have anywhere from ten to twenty pieces always in the works. We   re  sitting there a month before a big art show, and I have nothing done.  She   s starting to get nervous, but then all of a sudden, two weeks before  the art show, there   s twenty pieces. Pick them up, finish them off in an  hour, and you got one. It   s all about a process, though. She   s learned not  to be so nervous anymore. She still makes sure that I have the pieces  that certain collectors come by to get. She makes sure that I have those  and new woods for them to look at.  Little Thunder We   ll talk about that process in a little bit. What   s an honor, maybe,  that you   re particularly proud of, distinguishing between honors and  awards a little bit? You   ve had some nice commissions, I think, from  different organizations.  12  Hart Yes, different organizations have given me honors. It was back in the  early   90s at one of our tribal events, the Cheyenne Arapaho tribes, (I  think it   s the Oklahoma Indian Nations) they honored me as their Indian  of the Year. At that time, I was doing a lot of work on the state level,  and I think they recognized some accomplishments. I think they  probably just recognized the difficulty of the job that I had and thought,     He survived it, so we   re going to honor him for that.    Being honored  by your own people, your own community, is to me something that   s  very heartwarming.  Little Thunder Right. You   ve talked about working for the eye with your wooden bowls,  not for functionality. I wonder if you can just expand upon that a little  bit.  Hart What my exposure as a youth to just running around the creek and  being out in the country, no brothers to play with, so I made up my own  games and my own things to do at the creek. I developed an eye for  nature and an eye for the natural, the natural beauty. I think that   s what  wood has. I understand wood and all the different types of wood that  there are, and I know the characters of them. The pieces that I make, I  really try to have a very simple form to them and simple shape, and  something that highlights that natural character of the uniqueness of the  wood. They are. They   re for the eye. I make functional pieces, though.  People want wooden bowls, so I make those, as well.  Little Thunder Put some of that eye appeal in there.  Hart Yes.  Little Thunder In your travels, you   ve mentioned Southwestern pottery as an influence,  but have there been other influences, do you think, upon your bowls?  Hart Well, there   s been other influences from other artists on my work. At a  young age there in Clinton, Oklahoma, there was a art show on the  creek where I grew up. There was a basketmaker, basket weaver that  came there, Mavis Doering, Cherokee basket maker. She sat under a  tree, shade tree, and was weaving her baskets. We watched her. It was a  several-day festival. She had me sit down by her, a lot of kids sit down  by her, and she taught us how to weave, so I got to know her. As I grew  up, when she saw me doing my wood, she said,    You need to  incorporate the weaving that I taught you into your woodworking.        Okay, I   ll do that,    but I had to think of how to do it. I started just  buying some commercial reed and weaving it into my pieces and then  just sort of let that rest for a while. I   ve picked it back up recently, and  I   ve really gone contemporary with it. The weaving that she taught me  13  to do, I incorporate that into some pieces I do now. The material that I  use is stainless steel. I have wood and woven stainless steel in some  pieces that I do now. I   ve only made four of them, but they seem to be  very popular. That   s one of them.  Little Thunder That   s great. We   ll look at one. What is the smallest and largest piece  you   ve ever made?  Hart The smallest piece is certainly no more than an inch and a half by an  inch and a half in size.  Little Thunder True miniature.  Hart I could probably go smaller than that. I do enter miniature competitions.  They have a maximum size that it can   t be any larger than three inches  in any dimension. I do make small pieces. Kind of an issue I have with  the small pieces is before an art show, one of my daughters usually  picks one of those and says,    I   m keeping this for my collection.    I lose  a good miniature every year before an art show, but she   s got a good  collection, I think. (Laughter) The largest piece, there   s one that   s over  twenty inches tall. I made some that are right close to twenty inches  diameter. I made a piece that I, actually, was able to weigh it before I  put it on the lathe, and it weighed close to two hundred pounds. All  finished, off the lathe, it   s under ninety pounds. This is removal of a lot  of material and a lot of moisture.  Little Thunder In a way, are the size limitations, do they have more to do with weight?  Hart It had to do with equipment.  Little Thunder Equipment.  Hart My equipment has limitations on it, but still something over twenty  inches in either dimension is quite large and heavy. You get in any  bigger than that and it is almost too heavy for a person to handle to get  up there on the equipment.  Little Thunder What   s the most challenging bowl you   ve made to date, or piece?  Hart There   s a type of wood that I really like, but it comes from the root  system of a tree. It   s got a lot of coloration to it. It has a lot of natural  openings to it because you can imagine the root starting to spread out.  It   s not solid wood, but also because it comes from the root, it has a lot  of silica. There   s sand, and there   s actually rocks that are wedged in  between there. It   s really difficult on the tools, given that aspect of it.  The wood itself, it   s buckeye. It comes from California. Buckeye burl is  14  from the root of the tree, as I said. It   s a softer wood. In the work that I  do, softer woods are a little bit more difficult to work with than the  harder woods. It   s difficult because it   s soft, and then it   s a challenge  because it has a lot of sand and grit and things that are tough on your  tools in there. Takes a long time, but the pieces come out wonderful.  They   re worth it at the end.  Little Thunder What   s the best compliment you   ve ever received for your work?  Hart Oh, I don   t know. I   ll give that one some thought. I   ve certainly had  some interesting comments on my work, too.  Little Thunder Or maybe the most interesting comment? (Laughs)  Hart I have a kind of funny little story. The second day of an art show,  particularly an art show that   s busy, you   re just kind of worn out and  you   re sitting there. I remember a lady   I had a lot of redwood pieces  on my table. A lady came by. She was looking at them, and she was  really talking about them and touching them. She said,    These are  beautiful pieces.       Thank you very much.    As she was walking off, she  said,    And I know redwood. I used to live in a redwood tree.    She was  walking off. I was so tired, I didn   t know whether to call her back to  hear the rest of that story or just let her go. I just kind of stood there,  frozen, thinking,    Wow, now that   s a story,    but I missed out on it. I let  her go. I was too tired to chase after her to hear the rest of that story.  You get into a lot of unique conversations with people. I think  something that was fun for me one year, (it happened in Santa Fe) there  was a couple from the East, from New York. They weren   t even out  there for the show at all. Didn   t even know it was going on. They were  coming out there to visit because they wanted to get married there. They  were coming out ahead of time to see Santa Fe for their first time and  plan their wedding. It just so happened that the art show was going on,  Santa Fe Indian Market. They had been all over, looking at things for  two days, but they loved my wood. They decided that   s the gift that  they   re going to give each other for their wedding, and they bought a  piece. I was happy to be a participant in that big event for them.  Little Thunder That   s a neat story. How much of your output is commissions?  Hart My commission work is very low. Some of that is just because what I  prefer to do is to make a piece of the wood that I have available, rather  than to go out and search for wood that might be very specific to what  they   re looking for. One of the, I think, unique commission pieces that I  have was commissioned by one of the former governors here in the  state of Oklahoma. He wanted a matching set for their lake house, their  15  lake cabin. I said,    Okay, I   ll make you one.    I did that, and when I was  done, I thought,    Never again am I going to try to make two identical  pieces.    It sounds easy. It   s not easy. He has the only matching set that  I   ve ever done, two matching pieces. I hope he keeps them on opposite  ends of the mantle because they really don   t match 100 percent to be  sitting next to each other.  Little Thunder I was happy to see that you have kept a few bowls around, and you   ve  explained how your daughters are able to keep your work, but I  wondered how you are able to decide. Sometimes artists don   t keep  things. How do you decide what you   re going to keep for yourself?  Hart I wanted to keep some as my skills progressed over the years. I wanted  to be able to have a variety of pieces from the beginning stages through  now, so I   ll try to keep about one piece a year to see what it looks like.  Some of the pieces that I have here and have up on the shelf, I didn   t  intend to keep. As an example, I had one piece sitting out on a table. I  cut it so thin, it   s translucent. You can do that to this particular type of  wood, but it makes it feather light. Just the slightest breeze came up and  blew that off the table. When I heard it hit, I heard it crack, as well. I  can   t repair it, but I   ve kept that piece. It   s on the bookshelf. There are  several of them up there. They have the cracks to the back end so you  can   t see them. I really have tried to keep some pieces over the years  just to see how my work has changed and how the styles have changed  slightly, and even the forms have changed.  Little Thunder That   s a good idea. What would you say the evolution of the form has  been?  Hart I think I   ve refined it, in looking at it. I make the pieces that I feel look  good. It doesn   t mean that everybody agrees with me. I know some  people don   t. Some people will have a conversation with me. They   ll  say,    It would look better if you did this or did that to it.    I said,    Yeah,  but that takes it out of the style that I do,    and I do what I like best. It   s  a way that I feel shows it off the best, so I stick with the style. I know  some other artists that do woodworking. There are some that are very  identifiable to their work because they are very consistent. I do admire  that. I think there was time when I thought,    I wish they   d do something  different,    but as I got older, I thought,    I really admire someone who  really sticks with a certain style and is very good at it.     Little Thunder I hadn   t thought about it, but there is something about wood that people  might feel more free to, like, make suggestions of you should do this or  that. They don   t do that so much with a painter.  16  Hart Right. Probably not, yes, but they do with woodturners. Then, of course,  I get a lot of retired guys come by that say they have a wood lathe in  their garage and they want to talk shop, so I   ll sit there and talk shop for  a while with them, too.  Little Thunder Let   s talk a little bit more about your process and techniques. Maybe  for starters, what are a couple of your favorite woods to work with and  why?  Hart My favorite woods, it   s not so much about the species of the wood but  the character of the wood. I like working with burls because the burl is  the part of the tree where it   s a lot of swirling patterns to it. It   s actually  caused by a lot of, I guess, buds that are trying to grow from the inside  of the tree out. On the outside of the tree, it just looks like this big knot  on the side of the tree, but you pull the bark off and it has a lot of  swirling pattern to it, interlocking pattern. That   s the favorite type of  wood. It comes in redwood; it comes in maple. You can find it in  walnuts and elms, so a lot of trees will have the burl. That   s a pattern  that I like to turn.  Little Thunder Are there woods that you are attracted to but you don   t use because  maybe they aren   t so abundant?  Hart I have turned some of the more exotic woods that are out on the  marketplace and that you buy, but I tend not to do too much of those  anymore. I experimented with them early on because I am conscious  about the environment. If I don   t know the source, that if it   s come from  a good source or not, if it   s something that people have gone and clear  cut, or if it   s a renewable timber stand that they come from or not, if I  don   t know that, then I   m not going to purchase the wood. I do have a  lot of unique woods that come from California, and they   re redwoods,  but I know that the sources of them are that this is trees that have been  removed by construction projects. They had to come down because  they   re a hazard to the population in some way. I don   t mind taking  those woods and giving them new life and continued life.  Little Thunder Right. So there are different ways that you source your wood. Some you  buy, others you look for, yourself.  Hart I do buy some blocks of wood in the retail marketplace. Generally what  I like to do is be in contact with the sawmills throughout the United  States. They   ll know what I am looking for. I like to have tree sections  shipped to me, and I cut them up, myself.  Little Thunder A section would be how big?  17  Hart Well, I just got a shipment in. A log was sent to me. A part of a log was  sent to me from California. It was redwood. I counted the growth rings  and consistently got close to 250 rings in there, so it   s quite an old tree.  It measured over thirty-six inches in diameter, and they sent me a  twenty-inch section of it. It shipped in at over five hundred pounds, so it  was a heavy block of wood. That   s what I prefer to do is get the big  pieces in. The other source is that I have a good ear for chainsaws, so as  I   m driving the neighborhood, I hear a chainsaw going, I   m curious  enough to drive by and see what   s going on. I   ll ask, and I   ll pick up  pieces of wood that way, as well. During an ice storm that we had, in a  neighborhood there were a lot of trees that came down and falling  across people   s driveways. I took my chainsaw around and said,    I   ll  make a deal with you. I   ll clear your driveway if I can have some of  your wood.    I picked up some wood that way, as well.  Little Thunder That   s neat. Can you take us through the process of preparing the wood  for woodturning?  Hart I start with, when I get a piece of wood in from whatever source it is, if  it comes off of a tree, I take care to seal it up because the worst thing for  wood is to dry too fast because it cracks. I seal the log up.  Little Thunder With a sealer?  Hart Yes. I have piles in the back that are waiting for their turn, and piles in  the garage that are waiting to be turned. I start with a solid block of  wood. It goes on the lathe as one solid piece, and I shape the outside of  the piece first. Then when that   s done, I go in and hollow out the inside.  This is hackberry. This actually came from my backyard. Hackberry  from my backyard. When I got this log, I sealed the ends of it up, and it  trapped all the moisture on the inside. You see all these black patterns  that are here. That is a very early stage of decay. That   s caused by all  the moisture that was trapped in the wood.  I know through experience now about how long it takes for hackberry  to produce this. I have a lot of hackberry sitting out back. Pecan does  the same thing. That   s one way that I   ve encouraged the patterns to  show up in this wood. It started as a solid block that   s on a lathe this  way. It   s, of course, rotating, and I shape the outside first to get that  outside profile. Then for the opening, I have different tools that are  straight bars and some that are hooked. That   s what allows me to go in  through the opening and hollow out the inside.  All my pieces are very uniform in the thickness all the way through.  That   s just one of the characters of the pieces that I like to produce is  that they   re very light, they   re thin, but they   re uniform. I   m going to  18  say that 80 percent of the time that I spend on a piece is all the interior  work that you don   t see. It   s hollowing it out, and it   s giving it that final  refined thickness all the way through. I can rough-shape a piece in just a  matter of an hour, but hollowing it out is going to take ten hours or  more until it   s finished. That   s kind of the rough, the quick version of  the process. Other pieces that I have my designs on, I   ll just leave extra  material and carve away to get that design.  Little Thunder What   s one of the best mistakes you ever made while you were  woodturning?  Hart I think my in-laws might appreciate one of the mistakes that I made. I  was making a competition piece for one of the big shows, and it was  one of the bigger pieces that I   ve made. I don   t know if necessarily I  was in a hurry, but I certainly wasn   t paying as great attention to the  detail as I should have. I pushed my tool too hard to the bottom, and it  cut through, cut a hole in the bottom of the piece, which meant this is no  longer a piece that can be entered in the competition. I filled the bottom  of the hole up, finished it off, gave it as a gift to my in-laws. They have  it in their house with the instructions not to let anybody pick it up and  look at the bottom of it. (Laughter)  Little Thunder That   s a great story. Since you seal your pieces, then, you   re not like  other wood sculptors might be. You   re not having to let it cure for a  certain amount of time, right?  Hart Well, I do. I try to. There   s a process, and so timewise I may pick up a  fresh piece. If I turn and start a fresh piece today or this week, I would  take it down and turn it about 90 percent. It   d still be about an inch  thick all the way through. That piece is going to be sitting for a while  and drying because I want the moisture content to come down and I  want to help slow that and control it so it doesn   t dry it too fast and  crack. It   s probably going to be in my shop for maybe a couple more  months, drying. Then I can pick it up and finish it off.  Little Thunder Right, and you   ve got the inside as well the outside to contend with.  Okay. Do you feel like you   re finding the shape that the wood already  contains, or do you feel like there   s something else going on?  Hart If you look at my work, you can probably identify several different  styles. It   s either a taller vase, or something that   s even smaller, more  like a seed pot shape. The shape, again, is really defined by the wood  and the character that I want to try to bring out in the wood. Some  pieces, I know ahead of time, and it works. Other pieces, they can start  out twelve inches diameter, and it   s not working, not working. It   s three  inches in diameter by the time we   re down to and get it finished.  19  Little Thunder Then you   ve got the pattern.  Hart Then you   ve got the piece. (Laughs) Most of the time, my pieces are  just only slightly smaller in diameter than what I started with, but  sometimes that doesn   t work. You just can   t get it.  Little Thunder You mentioned in an article, I think, potters like to use your leftover  wood chips.  Hart Yes, I do a lot of things with my wood shavings. I just have them in the  back in a compost pile. I   ll take that out to my mom sometimes. There  was a potter I was talking to at an art show, and he said,    I   d like to try  some of your wood shavings when I fire my pots.    I said,    Sure.    I bag  it up and call him every once in a while and say,    Got a couple bags.  Come get them,    and he does. He uses them. I don   t throw anything  away. I always try to either compost it or do something else with it.  Little Thunder Clay was such an original inspiration. I wonder if you thought about  any clay/wood pieces or collaborations.  Hart Talked about that with other artists. Talked about collaborating with  them, but we   ve just never executed that. It   s an idea that we kick back  and forth at art shows, I guess when we   re bored and have nothing else  to do. It hasn   t happened yet, but it might.  Little Thunder How do you finish your pieces, then?  Hart Because I really like the natural character of the wood, I just use a  natural oil. I don   t change any coloration at all. I don   t change the color  of the wood. It   s just an oil. ... It   s a tung oil that I use, and it   s a  commercial product. I don   t mix my own. What I use is actually made  to be part of a two-step process, but I don   t do the second step. I don   t  apply a heavy topcoat to my pieces. I just like the penetrating oils so  that it really looks like the natural look of the wood. I oil them, both  inside and out. They   re sealed so that as they move to a different  environment, any intake or release of moisture, it   s going to be very  slow and it   s not going to harm the wood.  Little Thunder Do you title your pieces?  Hart I used to try. I don   t anymore. I ran out of names. My creativity only  goes so far, and coming up with names is not one of them.  Little Thunder Do you have to title competition pieces?  20  Hart Occasionally you do, and I just title it by the name of the wood.  (Laughs) Redwood Number Twenty-Four. Redwood Twelve. I   m not  very creative on naming. I used to try to be and really supported by a lot  of the people in the neighborhood so they know I   m an artist. We used  to have open houses before art shows. A lot of our friends have left the  neighborhood now. They would come over, and I   d have a little game  where I   d give them wine and say,    Help me pick out what my  competition piece is going to be. Oh, yeah, it needs a name. You can  help me come up with a name.    That would just be the riot of the party.  I don   t think I ever used one of their names, though. We sure had fun in  that process.  Little Thunder That was a great idea. In terms of your signature, I read that you use  the Morning Star symbol as your artist remarque?  Hart What I do is I incorporate the Morning Star symbol into my some of my  pieces that I do, and then I guess as a logo for Nathan Hart Studio I   ve  incorporated that. I don   t actually always sign my pieces with that. I just  sign my pieces with my name.  Little Thunder You want to go ahead and talk about the significance of the Morning  Star symbol?  Hart Yes, in the wood, one thing to think about is exactly how some people  would describe it. They said,    Oh, that   s nice. You have a square top on  a round bowl. That   s very unique.    Yes, that is what it looks like at  times, but it has deeper meaning than that. If you look at those  particular pieces from the top down, it   s a star design, the four-pointed  star, which is a Morning Star design. A lot of the tribes have that,  particularly in the Plains area, so our tribe has it, as well. To me, it   s  really about the renewal. It   s the sign of a coming day, something that   s  new, that   s renewed. It   s fresh. It   s continuance. That   s why I  incorporate that design into my pieces.  Also, that particular design, when you look at it from a lower level so  it   s really from the top down, you can see the Morning Star, but if it   s a  piece and it   s up on the mantle and you   re looking at it from the side, it  looks like a mountain range. That   s significant to me, as well, because  our people come from the area that was once near the mountains, near  the Rocky Mountains at a particular point in our history. It has dual  meaning, depending on how you look at that, from what angle. I   m very  happy with someone who just recognizes a square top on a round bowl,  too. (Laughter)  Little Thunder What   s your creative process from the time you get an idea about your  bowls?  21  Hart The creative process is really about examining the piece of wood and  looking for what that unique character in that wood is. Sometimes you  can identify it right away, and sometimes you can   t. I have pieces that I  haven   t started because I just can   t figure out what   s going to be the top,  what   s going to be the bottom, how   s it going to be orientated, so  they   re still just sitting out there on the woodshop floor. Maybe one day  I   ll pick them up and will actually get something out of them. For the  most part, it really is knowing what   s going to be in the layers down  below the bark, and as you cut into the piece, what that   s going to look  like. That   s what I want to bring out: those natural characters, bring that  out in a piece.  Little Thunder What is your creative routine? Do you have one, in terms of working  mornings or nights or during days?  Hart I   m a morning worker. It   s not out of the question in the summertime  particularly for me to get up at two o   clock in the morning and go out  and be out in the shop   producing by three o   clock. I don   t mind. Three  o   clock to six o   clock is a great time period for me. I can   t stay up late,  and there is a certain danger element to what I do. I   m working with  power equipment. You certainly don   t want to wear loose clothing or  get caught up in the circular motion of the lathe that   s going on. I   m a  morning person, and I will get up early mornings.  If you ask one of my daughters, because one of my daughters has a very  creative mind, she thinks it   s just boring for me to get up and go out to  the woodshop. She has this deal where she believes that I get up and  make my coffee, sit on the deck, drink coffee with Bigfoot, and then I  go. He comes to visit me. We chat, and then I go out to the shop and  turn. It   s always,    Did you see Bigfoot today? Did you have coffee with  Bigfoot today?       Oh, yes, I did.    (Laughter)  Little Thunder It   s probably cooler out there in the morning.  Hart Oh, it is. It   s tough in the wintertime. My shop is heated, but it   s not air  conditioned. That   s fine because I love to open up all the doors and turn  with the natural breeze going through, hearing the sounds of the day.  I   m good for about six hours. An eight-hour day on the lathe is really  too long. Six good hours is what I can put in throughout a day. It   s  tough physically to work any longer than that.  Little Thunder Right. What   s a special project that you   re excited about right now?  Hart It just so happens that right now you and I are talking in the month of  October, but coming up in the month of November is an anniversary  22  date for something that happened very tragically to our people, to our  tribe. That   s Sand Creek. It   s a massacre that happened to our people in  the state of Colorado. This particular year, the Denver Art Museum and  some other organizations and galleries want to hold an event sort of  commemorating that. They   ve asked a number of Cheyenne artists to  come in and be a part of a show, a symposium, and a lecture series. I get  to be a part of that, and my work is going to be a part of that. I sort of  explain in the article that was written, some of the pieces that I do  resemble a matriarch figure.  If you look at it, it looks like the piece has a neckline and has a blanket  or a shawl wrapped around it. To me, that represents the matriarch  figure, an elder, a woman. I   m going to make those pieces also because  it   s recognizing older generations. I know in our tribe we had strong  women leaders. We   re recognized and known for our warriors and our  chieftains, but we had strong women in our tribe, too. I   m going to  make some of those pieces specific for that event that   s coming up that,  again, recognizes a very tragic event with our tribe, the Sand Creek  Massacre. That   s a project that   s coming up in about a month, less than  a month or so that I   m working on.  Little Thunder That   ll be neat. What do you consider to have been a kind of pivotal  point in your art career, a sort of fork-in-the-road moment?  Hart Well, there was a time when I was just doing this as a hobby, kind of  for the love of wood, but made a decision one year to focus more time  on it because two things: one, people were admiring my work, but I also  wanted to get wood out in these shows that I go to because I don   t see  other wood artists that are there. I kind of wanted to be maybe a pioneer  in that area and introduce wood to those marketplaces. There was a year  early on when we were doing nine shows a year and a lot of travel and  producing a lot of inventory. I guess a pivotal moment came when I  decided to maybe scale it back and just focus on doing a couple of big  shows, certainly have more inventory there. I found that it worked. I  didn   t have to do a large number of shows to sell my work, just  concentrate on some of the bigger shows and good pieces, good quality  work.  Little Thunder When was that when you decided to really make that shift?  Hart Probably around 2000. The first piece I turned was in 1989 and did a  few small shows early on. In my career, the first time I got accepted to  one of the big shows, Santa Fe Indian Market, was a good year for us. It  was an interesting year because I was on the waiting list. We actually  didn   t know we were going until two weeks before.  23  Little Thunder Oh my goodness. (Laughter)  Hart We had some pieces in the works. We went out and set up, and it   s been  good ever since.  Little Thunder And that was what year?  Hart I don   t even remember. We were trying to think of that. It was either  2000 or 2001, one of those two years.  Little Thunder Right. What   s been one of the highlights of your career so far?  Hart I don   t know if I   ve really had a highlight because everything seems to  be just pretty steady and pretty consistent in what I do. I have been  asked to do some special pieces and some pieces that are part of some  special collections. There   s some pieces in private collections, but there  are some pieces in public collections, as well. Here in the state of  Oklahoma, there were a number of us that were selected to put pieces in  the new Judicial Center that   s being built. To be a part of that just  because the quality of the art that is there, it   s good to be one of the  artists that are there. Also because of the project, what it signifies is that  there was actually a public project that really focused on incorporating a  lot of art into the building itself. To pull that off, I think, was a major  success. My hat   s off to the people who were able to do that.  Little Thunder Right. What   s been one of the low points?  Hart We   ve gone to some shows, you know, the economy   . When people  scale back, they scale back on their purchases of art. We   ve had some  shows that have just been very tough, didn   t sell a thing. Had a lot of  expenses and didn   t sell. Roughing it through the tough years, the years  of a tough economy, was tough as an artist but just kept plugging  forward. What I did notice is that the collectors still bought. They just  scaled their purchases back quite a bit. There was some people who  were very loyal collectors who didn   t even come to the shows because     We can   t buy. We   re not even going to be tempted to buy. Just can   t  do it.    Then didn   t go to the show. It wasn   t so much about not having a  sale to make but also not seeing good friends. They couldn   t show up.  Little Thunder Well, is there anything else you   d like to add or anything we forgot to  talk about before we look at your work?  Hart My work at some of the big shows that I go to is the only work of its  kind, so in some respect I stepped out into a new arena with it. I do  encourage people to look at new mediums to work with. I   d like to see  more people working in wood out there. I hope that I can influence  24  people to work into wood, specifically. Also, a little bit broader than  that is I hope I can have influence on sparking people   s creativity. They  can look at something and hopefully they   ll say,    Oh, I can do that,     and then they   ll go out and do it.  Little Thunder All right, well, we   re going to pause a minute and look at some of these  pieces.     Nathan, you want to tell us a little bit about this bowl?  Hart This bowl, it   s a eucalyptus, and it has kind of the pattern in it. If it was  a maple, people would call it a Tiger Stripe maple. It was a unique  piece. Really liked it. It belongs now to the collection of Sydney Hart  because, as she usually does, she grabs one piece off the table before I  go to the art show and says,    This is going to be mine.    That one   s hers,  and it happens to be one of her favorites.  Little Thunder How about this bowl?  Hart This bowl, this wood is actually pecan. The top of it is the Morning Star  design that I incorporate into some of the pieces. It   s one that a lot of  people at first glance will like it because it has the square opening on a  round bowl. I think that   s a great contrast, but it has deeper meaning  than that. The design is actually that of a Morning Star, which to me  represents resiliency, rebirth, the renewal. I incorporate that into these  pieces because that   s actually what I think these pieces are. There   s a  continuance about them. This could have been destined for a firewood  pile, this piece of wood, but I saved it.  I turned it, and hopefully someone can give it long-lasting love in their  household. That   s the Morning Star design. From the side, if it   s up  high, like on the mantle or something, it looks like a mountain range.  That also is significant to me as a Cheyenne person because I know that  our people at one time lived near the Rocky Mountains, and they moved  up and down the plains as part of their life. That   s what this is, Morning  Star, mountain range, part of my culture as a Cheyenne person.  Little Thunder It   s beautiful. Okay, how about this hackberry bowl?  Hart This is a piece of hackberry. This is one of the pieces that I   ve selected  to keep in my home. Comes from my backyard. It   s actually a tree that  we got cut down when the guys were coming through and cutting all the  trees that were interfering with the highline wires, utility wires. They  cut it; I saved it. The pattern that you see is called spalting and is  actually very early stages of decay. What I did with this log is I sealed  the ends up, trapped all the moisture inside, and this is about a year and  half later, I started to turn it, and it has all that coloration that   s in the  25  piece. That   s all natural and unique to this particular piece. Each spalted  piece is going to have its own patterns.  Little Thunder Right, right. How about these two pieces?  Hart The tall vase is mesquite, and the smaller piece next to it is a eucalyptus  piece. The eucalyptus in this particular piece comes from Australia. The  carving around it is really meant to resemble a figure of a person that  has a blanket draped around them. That   s the design that I cut into that  piece. The tall piece is mesquite, and it came from a ranch near the Rio  Grande in Texas. There was a lady that came by my booth at one art  show, and she said,    Have you ever turned mesquite?    I says,    I have. I  just don   t have very much of it.    The next art show, she brought several  large stumps for me to have, so this comes from her ranch along the Rio  Grande.  Little Thunder I   m going to reposition the camera real quick because you can really  see the little lip that suggests the back of somebody   s head. Wonderful.  Well, thank you so much for your time today.  Hart How about this one?  Little Thunder Oh, yes  We need to add that one. I forgot about that, our mixed media  piece here. Tell us about this piece.  Hart This is one of my mixed media pieces. It   s wood and stainless steel. It  was inspired by a lady who taught me to weave baskets at a young age.  Her name was Mavis Doering, Cherokee basketmaker. She taught me  how to weave, and she always said,    I   d like you to incorporate what I  taught you into your woodturning.    For the longest time I just didn   t  quite know how to accomplish that. It came to me one day to turn the  top and the bottom of the piece out of wood, and then to weave in  between them, so I make these bowskets. I had to come up with a new  name, as well, so half bowl, half basket: a bowsket.  Little Thunder I like that.  Hart This is stainless steel and wood.  Little Thunder The weaving with stainless steel, that can   t have been easy.  Hart You go through several gloves in weaving this, weaving the wire.  Little Thunder All right. Well, thank you very much for what you shared today.  -------  -------
