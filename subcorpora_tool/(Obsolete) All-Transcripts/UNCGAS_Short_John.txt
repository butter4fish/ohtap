Ian Seim: This is Ian Seim, and I&#8217;m speaking with Mr. John Short today, March 12, 2014. He is the executive director of the NC Pride Parade and Festival, and we are doing an interview at Straw Valley Caf&#233; in Durham, North Carolina. First I&#8217;d like to start off with some general life history questions, so tell me a little bit about where you grew up, how you came to the area.        John Short: Well, I am what you call a true southern boy, so we have to start out with my family. If anyone&#8217;s a North Carolinian I am; we got a land grant from the king in the 1600s [laughter].        IS: From the king!        JS: From the king of England. And then my relatives were involved in signing of the papers for the revolution--before the revolution in Wilmington. Then one of my uncles was secretary to Thomas Jefferson, so the family has been involved in sort of everything that the country has seen from that point forward until now. And I personally grew up in Southern Pines, Pinehurst, which is about sixty miles south of here, in the sand hills of North Carolina in a very idyllic setting and have fond memories of all my high school days. And in the late [19]60s [I] came to the University of North Carolina, where I think I found my home. I knew once I reached that campus that I belonged there, and so I&#8217;ve been here ever since.        IS: What did you study at UNC?        JS: Well, surprisingly enough, I was interested in radio, television, and motion pictures. However, at the time, you had to have a degree in English first, and then take that as a second major. Towards the end, I became very much interested in art. My family had been in the art business their whole lives, from the [19]30s on, before even my father was interested and involved in it, so I began to shift my interest. It, of course, was the [19]60s, where it was the time of the flower power and all the hippies, and we all wore bell-bottom pants. So I then became very much interested in art conservation, and that&#8217;s when I left the university and took specialized training in just doing art restoration, and that&#8217;s what my career was from that point forward. So from [19]72 until 1999, I maintained a gallery in Chapel Hill, and we did 19th century paintings and also art restoration. I did a lot of work for the university, both Duke and UNC, and I restored all the paintings in the alumni center, at the George Watts Hill alumni center.        IS: What was the name of the gallery?        JS: J. R. Short and Son, I was the son.         IS: Ok, so you did it with your dad, then.        JS: My father was interested in portraiture, and--. [door closes loudly]        IS: In what was that?         JS: Portraits, portraits, our family had always been involved in portraits. Being the catalyst to have a portrait painted, they were the dealers between the artist and the person. But I was interested in 19th century paintings and not interested in portraits, so even though the name had J.R. Short and Son on it and I was the son, that was really my creation. I used him as a springboard. I was quite young at the time, 24. So I was young, and I needed to have more credibility, and I was able to do that with his backing, and some of his money.        IS: And that gallery was in Chapel Hill?        JS: It was in Chapel Hill.        IS: Ok. So you&#8217;ve lived in Chapel Hill since going to college here.        JS: Yes.        IS: Did you spend a lot of time in Durham during that time, around college, or maybe afterward?        JS: I lived pretty much in Chapel Hill until the [19]80s, and in 1982 I moved over to ninth street, because they had just restored a wonderful building. The Kenan family had worked on restoring Erwin Mills, and that&#8217;s when I moved to Durham, onto ninth street, and sort of fell in love, at that time, with Durham. I was older and not a student anymore, and I now still live in Durham, but very close to Chapel Hill, and I go to both equally.        IS: You said you moved in 1982 to Durham, which is right around the time when the first Pride March--I guess at that time it was a march--started.        JS: There wasn&#8217;t really a march. That was right around the time of the murder.        IS: Exactly, yeah.        JS: We&#8217;re talking to me because I&#8217;m the executive director of the North Carolina Pride Parade and Festival. In our history we refer to it as, &#8220;a murder, a march, a parade.&#8221; That&#8217;s because there was something that was happening in Durham that had been there, really, probably, in people&#8217;s memories after World War II, and that was there was a creek in north Durham, Little River. People today don&#8217;t realize, but the South had no air conditioning until the mid-[19]70s. So there was a much smaller population here, and the Northerners didn&#8217;t come to move down here until after air conditioning took hold. So when I was in school at the university&#8212;there was no air conditioning in the summertime, and the South became almost unbearable to do work. And most people in the South did not have swimming pools; it was not something that was commonplace. So it was very common for people to find creeks and places like that to have a place to swim. The Little River was this idyllic place which is no longer there. It&#8217;s been damned and it&#8217;s now a lake. But at the time, it was a creek about, in places, three feet deep, in North Durham. It was a very interesting social arrangement, and it&#8217;s almost hard to describe, but you went down these long dirt roads, out in the country way out in the middle of nowhere, until you got this old steel bridge that went over the creek. Then people parked along the dirt road, and right by the bridge, the creek was very shallow. Possibly even two feet or one foot wide, broad, and there were sandy banks. People with children would come out, and the kids could play, and the mothers could watch them and they couldn&#8217;t really get into trouble. There had been an old mill along the creek years before, and there was a large waterway constructed which no longer had water in it, but it was a pathway that went way down along the side of the creek. If you walked a mile down that you came to the area where the guys and girls would hang out, mostly at night. We called it the straight area. It&#8217;s where the guys would be dating the girls, and that was their spot. And then if you walked another complete mile down the creek, the creek made a sharp turn to the left with a strange rock formation. There was a twenty foot stone wall on the left-hand side that went up, and then on the right-hand side there were big, long, flat boulders, that were like, it wasn&#8217;t sand but it was rock. And for some reason that was chosen to be the gay and lesbian section. And it was always amazing to me the gentleness and the softness of the community at the time, because the girls would come down and take off all their clothes and be on the right side of creek, on the flat rock sunning, completely naked. And the boys would go to the opposite side of the creek, and we&#8217;d built this great big round rock container, so the water would build up to about chest level if you sat in it. It was like a cool hot tub. And we were all on that side of the creek, completely naked, and each group talking to itself, paying no attention to the other, except that we would generally bring drinks, and the girls would bring food, and we would exchange them. I often think of it--. There were several times when I was there that I just thought it was paradise lost, it was just something so sweet, and so gentle, and so wonderful, and we were in nature with these wonderful trees around us. And it was cool in the hot summertime, and it was just a special place. And unfortunately, my premonitions of paradise lost came true, because in 1981, people from out of town came down, two or three, I think it was two boys, to harass gay people. And beat up several people walking to and from on the path, but then killed a boy that was handicapped. And it turned out was not even gay, he was just unable to get away from them.         IS: Right, his name was Ron Antonovich.  
JS: I did not know much about it except one of the boys that was beat up on the path, before Ron was killed, was a friend of mine, and he was a construction worker. When they attacked him, he fought them back, and they let him go with just a few punches, and he punched them back. He later came to me and said, &#8216;The police have come to me, because I can identify them, but I&#8217;m afraid to go to court because I&#8217;ll lose my job.&#8221; And I told him, &#8220;Of course you&#8217;re not going to lose your job. You won&#8217;t lose your job. You have to go identify them; they murdered that man.&#8221; And he went to court, identified them, and the next day was fired.         IS: Wow.        JS: Amazing. So that was my experience. I was not politically active at the time. I had a business to run--.        IS: But you just frequented that spot.        JS: It was a place that a lot of people went for fun.  It was a well-known place, and it was a fun place, and people--. You see, we had no gay bars, and we only had places you would go with people to their houses and have parties, so gay life was very underground. Mostly people would have parties, [and] you&#8217;d have a friend that had a piano. I remember many of the parties would be on Sunday afternoon with someone who had a piano, and all these people, sometimes a hundred people, would show up. It was a very small community, and this was one of the things that was just part of the community. It had been going on for years. It was a very gentle thing, and that was what my experience was there.         IS: Do you remember how you first heard about the Little River spot?  
JS: Well, he came to me and told me about it. He was the one who came to me and said, &#8220;They&#8217;re asking me to testify.&#8221;        IS: I didn&#8217;t mean the murder--I meant that it was a hang out spot.        JS: Well, we all talked to one another, and like I say, it was a much smaller community. You just knew everybody. You&#8217;d just go to party after party. There was a professor at the university who we all admired because he would have a Christmas party, a dinner, and a Thanksgiving dinner. His house was open to anyone that was gay or lesbian without any restrictions: if you were alone, [or] if you just didn&#8217;t have anywhere to go, you could come have thanksgiving dinner at his house. We all knew it, and that was the kind of very small-town atmosphere that the community was in. So that was how I found out about it. And then again, I was not as politically active as I am now because I had my own life to take care of and was just working and caught up in my own endeavors.        IS: Do you remember the subsequent vigil that happened at the courthouse after the murder in 1981, and the march and all these things?         JS: I was aware but did not participate. Again, I had a business, and I just didn&#8217;t do anything very much politically. I was just not savvy to it at that time. It&#8217;s a long and winding road that got me to this particular spot. I was partnered, and was living a very nice life, and did not feel discriminated against at all. I was making lots of money, and I was doing work with all the people at the Country Club, and I was living a very nice life. So I didn&#8217;t feel discriminated against. My first--.        IS: Were you worried at all about maybe feeling like you would be discriminated against if you became more involved, given that your friend testified and was later fired?        JS: I don&#8217;t think so. I couldn&#8217;t be fired from my own company, and I was already doing a very specialized work. Most of the people that I was working with were aware I was not straight, that I was gay, and I did have a partner that they were aware of. So I was not exactly in the closet, it&#8217;s just that I was not attuned to going out onto the street or anything like that. I was very busy just doing my job, and so I wasn&#8217;t more or less involved. My endeavors for the gay community have come after I retired, when I could devote my time and energies, and had the time and energy to put into it. It&#8217;s surely when I became more involved, when I started volunteering for different things to do.         IS: So the first Pride was in 1981, and then in 1986--.        JS: Well, the first one, it wasn&#8217;t really a Pride. What happened was at that particular time in North Carolina life, there was something that was available to criminals that could somehow get them off, and they all seemed to know it. It was called the &#8220;gay defense.&#8221; And that was [that] you could commit murder and then say that the person you killed propositioned you, and you lost control [and] killed them. The jury would say, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re innocent.&#8221; It was called the gay defense, and it worked, and it was part of the psychology of discrimination that was just inherent in people at the time, and the lack of visibility of gay people. We were here, but we were very much invisible. What happened, and the reason why this killing aroused the interest, I believe, is that the people didn&#8217;t want them to just be able to walk away from a murder and get away with it with sixty days in jail. That was the standard, probably, operating procedure that could happen, it could just happen. And you know, as we see in the news today, it&#8217;s still happening. You can shoot into a car, kill someone, and say their music was too loud, and you walk away from it. So it was that kind of thing.         I remember talking with a couple of people who began that vigil, and they said, &#8220;We thought maybe ten people would show up. We had no idea hundreds would show up.&#8221; They were actually more stunned than anyone else that all these people would come out and actually show themselves in public and demand that these people be charged with murder. The district attorney did the right thing and did charge them. So that was what was happening there. Then from that grouping of hundreds of people, they thought, &#8220;Well wow, we could actually do something with these people,&#8221; because these were people who were political activists. We&#8217;re talking about Joe Herzenberg, who later became mayor pro tem of Chapel Hill, and other people, Mandy Carter, political activists that were interested in making change.        IS: And these were some of the people that organized that first vigil outside the courthouse.        JS: Oh yes, there was a whole group of them that were really the forerunners, that were very much at the beginning of making everything happen. They began to do little meetings, and the first actual concept of a pride march--and it was very much a civil rights march--was in [19]86. That&#8217;s when that happened. But it turns out that--I did not realize this, and a lot of people don&#8217;t realize this--but there was a period between this murder and [19]86 that there just seemed to be nothing happening.        IS: Yeah, I found that in researching, [that] there&#8217;s like five years there.        JS: But that&#8217;s not true. I found out later in talking with some of them that they actually were doing things. They used to do a thing called the Stonewall picnic and it was at UNC campus. What happened right after that year when they did the protest, they then began meeting and having this stonewall dinner. It was a spaghetti dinner, and potluck. Joe Herzenberg told me he never thought he could ever make that much spaghetti, he was making it by the giant potloads. They would do it on UNC campus, and they kept the core group together and added to it, so that by the time [19]86 came, it had grown to about 600 people, you see. We really need to go back, and one of the things I need to do is change and add that to our history, because Pride really was the precursor to the march, those Stonewall dinners. We still have a dream of reinstating those dinners, we just don&#8217;t have a committee for it right now.        IS: How often would those happen, were they an annual thing?  
JS: Once a year, it was done in June for the Stonewall riots, representing the Stonewall riots in New York. And in fact, the pride march was always done on June 17, also, for years and years and years it was always in June for that very reason, that June is sort of associated with pride month. There was actually that activity going on all along, and then finally in [19]86, they were organized enough to go through the battles it took to do a civil rights march. Of course the city--. The idea was to take the march to the different cities of North Carolina with this band of people. The cities, of course, would throw up all these barriers, &#8220;we don&#8217;t want you&#8221; and all this, and they had to go to court to get a judge saying you had to let them march. It was very dangerous. They were always afraid they would be attacked. There was actually opposition to the march. People would throw things, it was tricky, it was scary. Again, I was not a part of that because I was running a business, and it was not on my radar screen at that time.        IS: But you knew some of the people that were involved.        JS: Well particularly later, when I went and interviewed them, because I went back and interviewed them. How I got involved was that I experienced--. Because of the class of people I was working with in my business, I didn&#8217;t really experience any discrimination. And I was making lots of money, and so I didn&#8217;t feel like anything could be wrong. Later in life, I had met a partner, in the [19]70s, we were together for about 18 years. We were together from the day we met until the day he died. The year before he died he was sick, and we went to the hospital, and I experienced the first form, which was awful. I took him to the emergency room, and they wouldn&#8217;t let me talk to him again. They wouldn&#8217;t let me go see him, we&#8217;d been together for 17 years. I couldn&#8217;t get to see him.         IS: Was this at UNC hospitals?        JS: Yes. They called his brother from Raleigh, and they let his brother come over, and his brother would then tell me what was wrong with him. Of course, immediately after that [we] went and signed all the paperwork necessary to have power of medical--. You know the whole bit, so that they could never do that again, but it required all this paperwork. So when people in the gay community want marriage, it&#8217;s for the 500 different things that are immediately extended to a spouse that you&#8217;d have to pay thousands of dollars to have individual documents, some of which you probably couldn&#8217;t even do for that very thing. That&#8217;s the first time I was so enraged over that.        IS: When was that?        JS: [19]93. So it was not that many years ago. When he died, I then decided that I had nothing else to lose, that I didn&#8217;t care about anything except working to make--. That was the catalyst that caused me to become more aware of gay rights. It was just one of those, one of those things.         IS: So at that point then, is that when you started--. You mentioned that you interviewed some of these people that were involved earlier and things. Was it at that time that you sought some people out?        JS: After he passed away and I got interested, I got involved with the North Carolina Pride marching band. It was a small band, started by women, and my second partner--. I met someone two years later, and my second partner played the trombone and was interested and doing it, so the two of us joined that band. While I can&#8217;t read music, I do have an innate sense of rhythm. When I was in college, I actually played in a small Spanish orchestra, whatever, group, where I played the bongos and maracas.        IS: Oh cool, was it Charanga? Was it called Charanga at the time? I don&#8217;t know how old Charanga is. That&#8217;s kind of like the Latin jazz group now at UNC.        JS: I don&#8217;t know. It was very interesting. So anyway, when I got into the marching band, I became the music librarian; I organized all the music, and I was doing things that others who could play in the band didn&#8217;t have time to do. Then they put me on a great big bass drum, and all I had to do was just keep the beat. Most of them were looking at the music, and since I couldn&#8217;t read the music, I could watch the director. She could look directly at me, and as you know as a musician, the big bass drum is the heartbeat of the music, so if I speed up the orchestra speeds up, if I slow down the orchestra slows down. She was looking directly at me, telling me what to do. So that&#8217;s my position, it was my position for a number of years, and from that I had the most unbelievable experience of going to the [Millenium] March on Washington, in 2000. The March on Washington asked all of the bands, the gay bands in America, to come. North Carolina, being so close to Washington, our whole band went up. There were bands from San Francisco, from Washington, Oregon, New York. A 180 piece marching band is what showed up, finally. Of all the musicians there, I of course was the least talented. Very quickly I was shifted to carrying the banner. They were real, really very talented musicians, and when they played &#8220;The Stars and Stripes Forever,&#8221; I&#8217;ll never forget it, I just cried it was so beautiful. One of the things that I was able to do was, at the Lincoln Memorial, the day before the march, which was on Sunday, they had a wedding ceremony, which of course was not legal, they just did it anyway, and the band played &#8220;We&#8217;re Going to the Chapel and We&#8217;re Gonna get Married.&#8221; And I played the bell! [Laughter] Believe it or not, in the tapes, you do actually hear me over any of the other instruments, there&#8217;s 180 orchestra people, but there was only one bell, so I had my 15 minutes of fame. It was a very moving experience. There was a million people that showed up, and we were on the stage playing behind the different speakers. I got to actually speak to Ellen DeGeneres and see her up close, and it was a very moving thing to be on the stage and looking out over the millions of people. Then when I came back to North Carolina, of course we were all totally enthused and so uplifted by this incredible gathering that we were looking forward to the march happening in 2000 in North Carolina in June. It was supposed to happen in Durham. In April, I was sitting at a coffee shop in Chapel Hill, and you have to understand, the band, we&#8217;d been practicing the music to play all along, we already had our songs picked out, we were practicing for that march. Someone came by and said, &#8220;Did you hear the march has been canceled? We&#8217;re not doing it.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;What do you mean, what? Are you telling me--?&#8221; &#8220;Yeah the committee&#8217;s collapsed. They&#8217;ve announced in the newspaper, they&#8217;re not going to do the Pride march after all these years.&#8221; I had a friend, turned out to be a very close friend, she was my drummer that I played with. She also played the big drum next to me. I called her and she said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve gotta do something about this.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, they don&#8217;t want do to the march,&#8221; and she said--she denies this at this time, she&#8217;s a doctor and a fabulous person--but she said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s just me and you, we&#8217;re going down that damn street with these rainbow drums. We&#8217;re going to march if it&#8217;s just you and I, with two rainbow drums, we&#8217;re gonna go down ninth street.&#8221; And so from that, I began to collect a group of people that agreed to kind of revive the march because when we went and talked to the committee that has dissolved, they wanted to do the festival, but they didn&#8217;t have the numbers and volunteers to do the march.        IS: Do you know what happened? What led to the decline of that committee, why it collapsed?        JS: I do know, because in my interviews--. But basically the person that was going to lead that committee was called away to work on a campaign for the president. It left it sort of without a leader, and it kind of just disintegrated right before our very eyes. And the people that were there didn&#8217;t want to take on the responsibility of the march itself because of the legal and requirements and police regulations and the hoops you have to jump through. I was naive enough to think that we could just do it, and we were just determined that we were going to do it. And we did it; we actually pulled together a group of people. The original committee in 2000 sort of set us to the side and said, &#8220;Well if you want to do the march well you do it, but we&#8217;re not going to give you any funding. It&#8217;s a separate thing. We&#8217;re going to do our festival.&#8221; What happened was that--and this is from my side of the story, they might have a different viewpoint--but as we got closer and closer to the date, they began falling apart even more, so that one week before the event, we found out that they didn&#8217;t have the money for the stage, and they didn&#8217;t have a stage announcer. So I had to jump in and find someone to do that, and that&#8217;s how we wound up on the steps of Duke Old East, because that was a natural stage. Teddy Roosevelt had spoken from it in the early 1900s, and we didn&#8217;t have the money for a stage to be built and put up. Of course we just said, &#8220;We&#8217;ll just use that.&#8221; We did it, and it worked so well, we&#8217;ve never ever gone back from that. After that particular march--. And we were so proud when we were able to have that march go on. About 1500 people marched, so we were so proud.        IS: And it was you and this other woman pretty much?        JS: Yes, Dr. Ellen Cohen. She was--I call her the mother of pride.         IS: Is that c-o-w--.        JS: c-o-h-e-n.        IS: How did you do that?  Because it seems like your only experience up to then was just playing in the marching band.        JS: I can tell you, if I had to do it now, I&#8217;m too old and I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to. But I was younger then, and I just worked around the clock, and somehow--. I often think that the rainbow extends over this particular event. Things always seem to happen that make it happen when things look negative. It was just a spirit of going forward, and it&#8217;s sort of a miracle that it happened. I raised money by calling all of my friends all over the country and demanding one hundred dollars. The funniest part was [that] I have a friend in Raleigh who was a very important Jesse Helms Republican. She and her family were long time Republicans. I called her and said, &#8220;Could we go to the museum and have lunch?&#8221; I told her what I was doing, she said, &#8220;I know.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I wanted to talk with you about possibly donating some money.&#8221; And she said, &#8220;I was wondering when you were going ask.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Well for 100 dollars, we&#8217;ll put a big banner over the street with you and your husband&#8217;s name, saying that you donated the money. But for a few thousand we&#8217;ll say nothing.&#8221; And she laughed and she said, &#8220;Well, you see, that&#8217;s why we need this parade,&#8221; and she wrote the check out. It&#8217;s so funny that actual [long-time supporters of] Jesse Helms actually funded and helped fund the first parade. And that&#8217;s a little bit of the dichotomy, or whatever, the juxtaposition of North Carolina. It&#8217;s not just one thing or the other. Later on, our logo is North Carolina as a puzzle, and if you&#8217;ll see all the different colors, you&#8217;ll actually see two figures talking to one another, so that it&#8217;s not--. It&#8217;s a state that is very much in discussion, and it&#8217;s not all one or the other. It can flux, it can elect Jesse Helms and John Edwards the same time. It&#8217;s just an interesting, interesting state. So anyway, after we did that first one in June.        IS: So you considered that the first pride parade?        JS: No, that was a march, the one in 2000. It was [a] march until 2000. That was the end of that committee, and then it dissolved completely. There was no one to do it for the next year. No one wanted to do it for the next year. And I had put so much work, and Dr. Cohen had put so much work into it, we just said, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;ve just now learned how to do this, why not do it again next year? Just to kind of maybe keep it going, and we can hand it off the somebody.&#8221; The illusion [being] that we could hand it off to someone. So what happened was, we then realized if we&#8217;re going to do it, we&#8217;ve got a whole year to prepare. Well, what if we really had time to prepare? And there was so much angst with the 2000 committee, the way it was set up, and I wasn&#8217;t--. I was just an accessory to it. Then I began to question how the parade itself was organized. When we went to get paperwork and things for the march in 2000, there was nothing after all those years of marching, there was not even a--they didn&#8217;t even have a rainbow flag. They had no banners, there was just nothing. There was sort of a mailing list that they had, and that was it. And I was just thinking, &#8220;After all those years&#8230;&#8221; And of course, the Pride march was set up as a very political event. So the concept, which was valid when it was set up, had aged out, I think, over a period of time. When it first started, there was a handful of core people, and they would go to a city, and they would let the people in that city sort of do the march. Then it would go somewhere else, and it would take seven years before it cycled back to that city. So the marches were held in Wilmington, Raleigh, Charlotte, Greensboro, Asheville, Winston-Salem, Carrboro, you see it was--. Durham, it was all over the whole state. The problem was is that--. I went to start interviewing the people that had done these parades, marches, these were the marches. After June I went across the state and started trying to talk to people that had done them because I was still very much clueless as to what to do and how to do it, and [coming from a small business background] I knew that there were big problems.         IS: And this is after you kind of pulled the 2000--.        JS: That&#8217;s right, when I got involved in 2000, they had volunteers coming into a room and they were licking envelopes and stamps and folding papers by hand, and stapling them together. I just looked at them, and I said, &#8220;What in the world are you doing? For a hundred dollars we can go down to Kinko&#8217;s and they have a machine that does this. Why are we all spending four hours folding papers?&#8221; And they were sending out these copies only on one side instead of both sides, and it was just not done in a business-like way. When I went to interview, I found out a number of things. One was that, at a real basic core level, they always had a male and female as co-chairs. The women did all the work, and the men got all the credit. I was sort of amazed at that, I don&#8217;t know why. I just thought--. So when I would talk to the men, they wouldn&#8217;t even remember what was done! And then the women would be able to tell you exactly every little detail. And I remember having a conversation with one of the women directors, and she told me, &#8220;Never again will I get in my car and drive thirty miles to go to a public library, meet twenty of my best friends and argue for an hour and a half, and we all leave as enemies.&#8221; Because as a gay community, we&#8217;re just in the very beginnings of our ability to work with one another. And I believe that, because, as gay children, we were not picked for teams, you know, I mean, you know how, you might not know this, but I mean, a lot of gay boys and gay girls are just not picked for the team. Therefore we learned to do everything on our own, and we&#8217;re not used to working on teams. Straight boys, they&#8217;re all picked for the team, they all do whatever the captain of the team says. But gay people are these little individual orbits going all around, and we&#8217;re not experienced in working with large groups and that type of thing. So I began to see that there were real problems in the way it was organized; it was organized sort of like a congress. And we can see form our own congress how that&#8217;s important when you&#8217;re making big major laws, but it&#8217;s not very effective if you&#8217;re actually having to do something. In my interviews, I was making notes about the things that they were suggesting to change. We came back and we had this meeting, and Ellen and I tried to decide, &#8220;Well, what do you think? We&#8217;ve got control of it next year, we&#8217;re going to do it in 2001. Should we just go for broke?&#8221; One of the things was that in June, when we did the march in 2000, it was ninety-eight degrees out, and ninety-eight percent humidity. We had two people collapse on the street. The dogs&#8217; little feet were getting burned in the parade, you know the march. And we just thought, this is just--. Pride and the Stonewall Riots were in New York City in June because it was good weather.        IS: Yeah, it&#8217;s nice up there.        JS: Would they have really done it in January, if the riot had been in January would they have had--see what I mean? So it became Pride month because our rights were first expanded in the northern cities, and June was the first time when it was good to do it outside. So we thought about the natural time to do it here, [which] is when school starts up. We did research on what times of the year where there is humid activity, and the two months that came forward were September and April. And for here, September was just the natural fit. We looked and saw that there were no other gay events that would be disturbed by it. We were very conscious of that, nowadays no one pays attention to anyone else, but we were very concerned that it not harm anyone or overstep anybody&#8217;s boundaries or anything. So we reorganized the committee like a Broadway show. We really thought of the march as Aida going down the street. What we would do would be to put people--. Instead of having a mid-committee of 25 people all giving input into something, when it came to picking the t-shirts, we had the artist, and the t-shirt man, and the person on the t-shirt committee, and they decided on the design.         IS: Instead of everybody deciding everything.   
JS: Right. Because, in all honestly, you know what kind of decision you&#8217;d get on that. And then we had people assigned to each committee that were--. That&#8217;s what they did, that was their thing only. The idea was to break it down like a Broadway show; you had a lighting director that handled the lights, stage manager, you had this, and you had people running the audience, and everybody had a job, and they could be totally in charge of that job. Then you had Allen and I [as] the directors that stood back and watched the whole thing, and we knew what everybody was doing. What we would say to people was--. I had one volunteer who came to me with 25 suggestions. He was on the grounds committee that set up the tents and things like that. And not one suggestion was for the grounds committee. Isn&#8217;t that interesting? Isn&#8217;t this human nature? He got very vocal and he said, &#8220;You&#8217;ve not done a single idea.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Well, how many ideas have you come up with for you to do more work? You sat there all night, thought of all this other work for all these other people, but, you know, you haven&#8217;t put up one extra stake&#8221; So when we do our committees, say for instance, if we&#8217;re on Ninth Street putting up flags, someone suggests we put up an extra flag, we go to that committee, we ask them, &#8220;What do you guys think about this, since you&#8217;re doing the work?&#8221; And I&#8217;ll get two responses: &#8220;No we don&#8217;t like that idea,&#8221; in which case it&#8217;s canceled. Or, &#8220;We&#8217;ll do it.&#8221; And that way on that day, when it&#8217;s hot out and they&#8217;re climbing poles and putting up things all down the street, they don&#8217;t feel that that&#8217;s not their decision. They&#8217;ve had a real part in it. And by doing that, we&#8217;ve managed to keep people on the committee. Now many of them have been there for over ten years, the same people doing the same jobs. They&#8217;re only asked to do it one time a year for that one weekend, so we have people who are medical doctors, we have people who are executives, we have people that have very legitimate jobs, out climbing ladders, putting up flags, doing things like that.        IS: And you had kind of assembled a new group of people then, for the 2001 parade.        JS: Right, for 2001. And then we changed the date. But also there was another sea change. When we went down the streets, I noticed that there were very few spectators. There were very few in 2000. There was hardly anybody watching us. And it used to be held on Sunday afternoon. I&#8217;m a southern boy, and I&#8217;m ornery, and I thought, &#8216;No, I&#8217;m tired of marching.&#8217; We marched in Greensboro on a Sunday afternoon, and the march had not one person to see us march. It was like a tree falling in the forest, no one heard the sound. And I thought, &#8220;What are we doing? Why are we doing all this effort? I want to shut down the city. I want to do it at noon, high noon, on Saturday, is when I want to do it. I want to disturb the city. I want them to have to alter their routes. I want them to all say, &#8216;Oh wait a minute, the gay pride parade is going to be here on that day.&#8217; I want that to just be that public event.&#8221; So we changed it from Sunday to Saturday. And we moved it to September, the last Saturday in September, because at the time, by looking at over fifty years of rain statistics, that was the weekend that would have the least chance of rain. Now as our weather changing, we&#8217;re fluctuating on that.         But then there was another sea change, and that was we moved it to the concept of being a parade, but also something else. They had always tried to bring in people from out of state to give speeches and all this, and I, being a North Carolina boy, thought the most wonderful thing about North Carolina was Mayberry. And why are we ashamed of Mayberry, when you go all over the world, and everybody loves Aunt Bee? The Mayberry treated everybody kindly, in that little town, you know Gomer Pyle did just fine. What if we tried to create, re-create, that feeling at this event? So, with a very deliberate attempt, we changed the attitude and tried to make it more of a homecoming. We ceased to beg for money. They used to run around and every half hour from the loudspeakers beg [for] money and run out with buckets into the crowd, and it was just debilitating at times, and it was just awful sounding. And we made a decision: If we can&#8217;t raise the money before this event to pay for it, we don&#8217;t need to be asking people. The gay community is assumed to be all rich, white guys, but in fact, it&#8217;s far from it. And there&#8217;s a lot of people that don&#8217;t have the money. And the other problem in the gay community is that everything is a fundraiser, so that all they&#8217;re asking for is money, money, money. We determined: no money. You don&#8217;t have to pay a thing. We won&#8217;t do anything that requires anyone to pay any money. Now that&#8217;s not exactly true because, naturally, if we do a movie, we do that. But the main event that we put on, the festival, is open and free to the public. And the kids can come, and the other thing by making it a Mayberry event, we can bring grandma, and we can bring the kids, and the dogs. So that was the feeling that we constantly were striving towards. We made all kinds of constant steps. We eliminated bringing anybody from out of state, so that on our stage we have a few people singing locally. We very much are interested in local. Then, the other thing that we were able to do, was we determined that by moving it around every year, you were not able to have--. Every year there was a new person that had never driven the car before. So every year you had somebody that had never driven the car, and once they did it, they had no chance to make it better the next year.        IS: Yeah seems like it&#8217;d be really hard to gain momentum that way.        JS: It would be very hard. And also, the other problem was that the Pride march had gone around and not paid it bills, so that it was in the red. I remember going and asking somebody in 2000 for some money, a wealthy friend of mine, and he said, &#8220;No.&#8221; And I was stunned when he said no, because when he and I had gone to different AIDS charities, he&#8217;d given them 1000 dollars, and I just couldn&#8217;t believe that he wouldn&#8217;t give a hundred dollars. And when the event was over, he called me on the phone and he said, &#8220;How much do I need to write the check for?&#8221; and I said, &#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221; and he said, &#8220;Well, every year they do this thing. They beg money out of me to start with, and then they are so deep in debt, I have to write a 5000 dollar check to cover it.&#8221; Well, I said, &#8220;We&#8217;re in the black 400 dollars, but we&#8217;re in the black.&#8221; We partnered with local businesses. So we shifted to a Mayberry event; buy local and work with these local businesses, and then we came home to Durham. It&#8217;s where it started, and we just decided to do it there. My original dream was to do it in Raleigh, because it was a state-wide event, and it was in the capital. But when I did my interviews, it turned out that it was the year of the first Iraqi war, and they had planned to do the event in Raleigh, had planned it all year, had all the paperwork, all the permits. Everything was taken care of. And approximately three weeks before the event, the governor, Jim Hunt, canceled the parade permit, because he was going to put a military parade on the same street at the same time. And of course all it took was one phone call from the Governor to Fort Bragg, and you could have the military up here in a flash. So it was one of those things where they were able to just pretty much destroy, if they could, the parade. Now people that do these kind of events know that to get a parade permit or a march permit, you have to fill out all this paperwork, and it has to be done weeks and weeks in advance, or the cities won&#8217;t let you march. Well, they very carefully, in Raleigh, canceled it so that you didn&#8217;t have time to hardly move it anywhere else. But the city of Durham, where it had very first started, said, &#8220;We&#8217;ll waive that restriction if you just want to come here.&#8221; And I thought to myself, &#8220;You know, that&#8217;s sending a real message isn&#8217;t it. We need to bring this where it belongs, where it&#8217;s wanted.&#8221; Duke University always allowed us; they were the very first place. When no one would let them gather, Duke let them gather on that east lawn, in that little gazebo out there. We actually, in that whole concept of homecoming, came home ourselves to that one thing, knowing, from a political standpoint, that if you put it in one place, there would be desires across the state for other pride events. And we had this dream that they would all be at different times of the year like the state fair. They would have all the county fairs, and then they would all come to ours. Unfortunately, that hasn&#8217;t happened. It&#8217;s still a dream. They all want to do it the same month as ours, which means that we can&#8217;t go to theirs, and they can&#8217;t go to each other&#8217;. You just can&#8217;t control everything, and I&#8217;ve just let go of it. It was a beautiful dream about the peaceful forest, but it probably won&#8217;t ever happen. Anyways, we knew that that would stir, and in fact, we do have pride events now across the state in different times of the year. Unfortunately, they have all clustered in the same month that we do ours, so we&#8217;re not able to participate like we dreamed, that type of thing. And I was trying to think of other things that we had to change, but that&#8217;s basically the changes that we were able to make. From those changes, we&#8217;ve seen it grow from 1,500 to 15,000 attendants, so it&#8217;s really quite large. The parade last year was the largest it&#8217;s ever been at two and a quarter miles in length. This year we&#8217;ll have to increase the parade route itself. We were incredibly worried up until last year [because] the parade was a mile and a half long, and the parade route was a mile and a quarter, and it would pass itself like a snake. But, because of the bridge being out on Main Street last year, we had a two and a quarter mile route, and it didn&#8217;t slow anyone down, it didn&#8217;t prevent anybody from--. In fact, the thing got bigger. So we sort of grew to the size of the fishbowl. So we&#8217;ll continue that two mile route. It&#8217;ll still be in the original thing, we&#8217;ll just go further down Ninth Street and Broad Street and come back.        IS: Right. How soon after you made these changes, so like moving it to Saturday, and keeping it in Durham, did you--. At what rate did it grow? The number of people, and people that weren&#8217;t participating but were watching?        JS: In 2001, for the first time, we had hundreds of people on the street, watching. And I was amazed to see a complete age group difference. A civil rights march, for people that grew up in the sixties, ingrained in our psyche were the awful civil rights marches that were attacked, and the police dogs that they did to them, and how they treated the people marching, and how they were beaten. So you have that ingrained in your psyche, so when you said that you wanted to march, there were a lot of people that were just not marchers; there were a lot of people, like myself, that were just not the kind of people to go out there and march down a street. I just, it&#8217;s just not something I want to do. But a parade is a completely different thing. It&#8217;s a completely different concept change. So for the first time, we asked people to build floats, we asked people to come in costumes, we asked it to be fun. Who doesn&#8217;t want to go to a parade? So in 2001, we actually saw, for the first time, hundreds of people standing on the side of the road to see the parade go by. And it has grown sort of organically, bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, each year. In 2001 we had forty vendors. We have 240 vendors now. We had one float in 2001. Now we have maybe fifteen or sixteen big floats. And other groups, there&#8217;s almost forty cars in it. It&#8217;s pretty large. So it was just kind of interesting how it&#8217;s grown.         IS: Yeah. Do you think you did a lot more about, maybe a lot more effort into advertising? Or do think it was just the shift of day, and the word &#8220;parade&#8221; instead of &#8220;march&#8221; that drew a lot of people out?        JS: I think it was the atmosphere more than anything else. The fact that our event was a soft event. We deliberately, as I said, tried to have it as a Mayberry event. We really worked to make sure--. Our event has 51 percent or 52 percent women participation. We did have, for two years, a &#8220;dyke march,&#8221; but that got to be irrelevant because they felt perfectly--it wasn&#8217;t one of those--we didn&#8217;t sexualize it. And women felt comfortable in the atmosphere we created.        IS: Whereas you think before it wasn&#8217;t so much like that?        JS: I think when it was a march, it was much more--. I think women felt more in danger. Because women are naturally at more danger, and I know several of the women I talked to, they said, &#8220;When we marched, we were just so afraid, so afraid. That somebody would throw something, a brick or something, at us.&#8221; And so they were, you know, just as hard on them. But our event is very much fifty-fifty. And that keeps the men in line, so to speak. Just the pure presence of the ladies makes it a softer event. We do not have alcohol. That&#8217;s the other thing that we chose over a lot of events. We do not have, we do not sell any alcohol. It&#8217;s a non-alcoholic event. So it&#8217;s one that you can really bring dogs and kids and all that to.        IS: Much more open type of thing.         JS: Right, right, right. So it&#8217;s just kind of grown steadily. Each year it keeps getting bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. Now, to be honest with you, we made a determination a few years ago, the idea of getting bigger, that&#8217;s not a big goal of ours either. We want it to be still good and fun, and we look each year for something wonderful that we can do. We&#8217;ve experimented with many things. One year, we actually had a hot air balloon, this giant, giant, sixty foot hot air balloon that could give people rides up above the event. But that was not a success. When you were on the ground, it didn&#8217;t look like you were going very high. When you got up in the basket, that little tiny basket, and went up twelve stories, you thought if this goes up one more foot, I don&#8217;t think I could handle it. It was just one of those things we&#8217;ve tried. One of the things that we do is that we&#8217;ll come up with an idea. And then we&#8217;ll see how it formulates, and see how it grows. About 2002 we had a phantom 5k run. This was a run at eight o&#8217;clock in the morning for people that like to run. There&#8217;s these people that just are runners, they love to run. And it&#8217;s a gorgeous setting, you know, it&#8217;s in the fall, the weather&#8217;s perfect, you&#8217;re on Duke campus. And it turns out that the campus itself, if you run around it twice, that&#8217;s 5k. And it&#8217;s walled in. And it&#8217;s got a running path all the way around it, designed for runners. Well, last year, for the first time, some women that had run the phantom 5k the year before decided, we want a real 5k, where we&#8217;re timed, and prizes and all that kind of stuff. And it was just the most fun. It worked.  They formed their own committee, they did it, and it was a gigantic success, and I just can&#8217;t imagine us not doing it every year from this point forward. So it was really, really a lot of fun.        IS: Yeah. So have you talked to any of the people that were involved in maybe the first types of more march-oriented things, now that it&#8217;s all changed a lot, it seems like? Have you talked to any of them about their thoughts about how it&#8217;s changed, it&#8217;s less political?        JS: Well, they seem to be--. I&#8217;ve had very good compliments from them. I did meet with all of them. There was, about three years ago, a historical meeting at the library where they were doing the collection, the Durham County Library. And I got to meet with many--.        IS: Oh, was that in 2011?        JS: It was something like that, yeah.        IS: Because I know there was recently--.        JS: Right, and I got to meet with them. I think that they were really proud that it has continued, even though it&#8217;s a different form. But you understand, to some extent, when they first did theirs, they were having to go down hostile streets. Hostile, I mean, and people would slam the doors and disappear. Well, the world has changed. And when all the people bring their children out and are waving, &#8220;Hi John,&#8221; you can&#8217;t very well shake your first at them and say, &#8220;We&#8217;re here!&#8217; you see, &#8220;and we&#8217;re queer!&#8221; &#8220;Well, we know that, John! Good to see you!&#8221; You know, the world, we&#8217;ve responded to the way the world has responded to us. And as it turns out, one of the most brilliant things about the early organizers was that--. And there&#8217;s this discussion every year about whether Pride is necessary. The fact of the matter was, until people started coming out and being open, a lot of people didn&#8217;t even realize that some of their most favorite people were gay, they can push that back in the denial of it. And then when they finally realize the organist that played grandmother&#8217;s funeral was gay, all of a sudden gay people weren&#8217;t so awful. And when they realized that they already know a lot of gay people, and they like them, well, then it isn&#8217;t some far away distant thing. And they change their attitudes. There is a distinct correlation between people who know gay people and how they respond and like gay people and gay rights. So if you know somebody that&#8217;s gay and you like them, you&#8217;re much less likely to be bigoted, and that type of thing. And so I think that the people that started this, I don&#8217;t think we can ever predict the future, but they seem to very proud of the way things have turned out. And a number of them have pulled me to the side and said they were very happy and just amazed at how much support. Because you have to understand, it was a group of people, 400 people going down very hostile streets, and now there&#8217;s thousands of people on the sides of the streets, cheering. So it&#8217;s a completely different world.        IS: Yeah. I&#8217;ve been to a couple of the ones in the last couple of years, and it really seems like a celebration. I was really surprised to learn that it started out of a murder, and was a much more violent type of thing.        JS: Yes, yes. And that celebration thing is, and this homecoming thing--.  You see, there will be a time when we will have the Supreme Court, gay marriage will happen. We will have equal rights. And this will be a homecoming, we&#8217;ve already got that planned. This is just going to be like the Irish parade in New York. There was a time when the Irish were second class citizens, but no longer, and that&#8217;s the same thing with us. This will still be homecoming for us, a place to see people we haven&#8217;t seen all year, a place just to gather just for the fun of it. And just like the churches in little Mayberry have the homecomings once in the fall where all the children are brought back in, we can do that. It&#8217;s just good experience. And that&#8217;s kind of where our mind is focused on that type of experience.        IS: Cool. Well, great. Let&#8217;s see, do you have any other, any things you wanted mention about, maybe things you were working on?        JS: Well, one of the things we talked about earlier, was that do you think anything has changed in our government as we&#8217;ve become more Republican.        IS: Yeah, and how that&#8217;s affected the proceedings.         JS: And the truth of the matter, and I think I&#8217;ve alluded to this earlier, North Carolina is a very interesting state. I think that the trends for gay rights are increasingly growing within our own state. And even though it&#8217;s a conservative state, and right now it seems to be more conservative than it&#8217;s been, at its inner core, we still have those Mayberry values, and that will in the end, triumph. Our recent passage of Amendment One, which was the anti-gay marriage bill, really, from my point of view, was a gigantic success. We didn&#8217;t ever have any concept that all of the major metropolitan areas would vote for gay rights. We just had no idea that Wilmington, Winston-Salem, Greensboro, Chapel Hill, Raleigh, Charlotte, up in the mountains--we had no concept that these cities would all vote for gay rights. And we had no concept that forty-some percent of North Carolinians that voted would vote for gay rights. I just didn&#8217;t think that would happen. One of the sponsors of Amendment One actually said off the cuff, &#8220;We have to pass it now, because in ten more years it won&#8217;t pass.&#8221; Because of the changing attitudes, and the dying off of the older people. The other thing that I thought about in that passage was that if you looked at the state from a satellite at night, everywhere that you could see light is what voted for gay rights. And everywhere that was dark, voted against it. And so, what&#8217;s new? It&#8217;s the age-old, eternal question of light and dark, and people who are a little bit more enlightened and people that are less educated to the whole thing, that are able to be manipulated. So, anyway, I think this is just a blip on the screen, and I don&#8217;t think that we&#8217;re very much affected by it. We&#8217;re, again, not very political anymore, so we&#8217;re not trying to promote--. Again, we see this as more of a homecoming, so we&#8217;re not trying to lobby the legislature or anything like that. I think by not being so political, we are incredibly political because we&#8217;re changing peoples&#8217; hearts.         IS: Exactly, the very act of doing that seems kind of what it started out as the purpose anyway.        JS: Right. We had to laugh about three years ago. Some of the preachers--. We have twelve, ten to twelve protesters a year. We have more churches in the parade than we do individual protestors, so we have something like twenty-eight churches participating, and we have sometimes ten, eleven, nine protestors. But what I thought was so funny was [that] the protestor was standing there, and he had brought his wife and three kids, [ages] five, eight, ten. To see the parade! Even though he was protesting the parade, he brought his children to see the parade. &#8220;Well,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;If I could just somehow capture this picture, because what is wrong with this?&#8221;        IS: Yeah. Like, what do you think the kids are going to make of that?        JS: I mean if you really believe that we&#8217;re this terrible, then that&#8217;s abuse to those children. They should be taken away from you! It was just a very interesting thing to witness--        IS: Yeah, that&#8217;s really strange.        JS: --that they would bring their family to the protest. It was just something that I noticed and just found a way in my brain. But I think that we&#8217;re heading in the right way. I think we&#8217;ve sort of established an event that has its own identity and core, and I think that it&#8217;ll just go forward into the future. And even if it doesn&#8217;t grow, although it is growing, we really are reaching the pains of the growth. If it gets much bigger, can it still stay in that little idyllic park situation? This year it was, oh excuse me, 2013, it was so large that we had to--. Duke has decided to give us the entire street now and close down that part of campus for us. But we&#8217;re still hampered just by the physicality of the location. I&#8217;m hoping it just sort of stays about the same size.        IS: What do you think you&#8217;re going to do if it doesn&#8217;t?        JS: We&#8217;ll just have to solve those problems when they come. We didn&#8217;t know what we were going to do this year until they decided to give us an entire street and shut it down. It is possible to shut down Main Street for the entire day, that section of it, and we know that for a fact because Main Street, at that particular section, was shut down for a year and a half when they built the bridge. The city bus systems now have in place all of the different kinds of Plan Bs necessary to operate with that part of the street completely shut down, and it is possible to do that. The city has been very supportive, all along.        IS: Great. Well, thanks for talking to me. It&#8217;s been a great interview, pretty enlightening.        JS: I enjoyed it very much, thank you.        IS: Thank you.
