Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes, one that my grandmother would always say: if you don't know where you're going, any road will get you there.
Story_ID: 662903
Speaker 1: So now we're going to look at your family history, and we'll start with your parents, with your mother.  I'd like you to say and spell her name, tell her birthdate where's she from and tell me about her please.
Speaker 2: Great, my, my mother's maiden name is Catherine with a C. C-A-T-H-E-R-I-N-E, Fulton, F-U-L-T-O-N [Catherine Fulton Williams], she was married twice first to my father Henry McGee [Henry W. McGee, Jr.].  And then subsequently she married a fella by the name of Madison Williams.  And since that marriage in 1963, she's gone, gone by the name of Catherine F for Fulton Williams.  She was born in November of 1932 in Mount Airy, North Carolina.  Her father was a--him--support his family many different jobs both as a sharecropper in North Carolina, as a coal, coalminer in West Virginia.  Her mother was a homemaker and my mother was the youngest daughter of, of twelve children.  Growing up in North Carolina she had a--the family was, was quite poor, she went to segregated schools, terrible conditions.  The schoolhouse that she went to, for example, even in the winter months the students had to attend school with broken windows.  They grew up without indoor plumbing in the, in the home, and it was a very, very tough life.  And of course in her early years in the '30s [1930s] not only was there this specific challenge of the hardship of African Americans in the South.  It was also in the middle of the, the Depression [Great Depression] of the, the country was going through.  So it was sort of doubly tough. So like so many other families from the South, the family went from place to place.  Mount Airy was the base of looking for work, and the eldest daughter, Pearl [Pearl Fulton], came to Chicago [Illinois].  She had picked up, to pick up a trade which was the beauty parlor trade, she eventually made a little bit of a go of it.  And then gradually, member by member the whole family followed her to, followed her to Chicago.  So eventually both my mother's father who is named Winston Fulton, and mother Victoria [Nellie Fulton] ended up, the whole family in, in Chicago.
Speaker 1: So let me ask you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay go ahead.
Speaker 1: How--so they're twelve children?
Speaker 2: Yes she's one of twelve, right.
Speaker 1: Do you know what, what their home what, what size home did they live in, was this a rural area, what was their home life like?
Speaker 2: That I don't know, it was a, it was a rural area--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --and from what I, my mother hasn't gone into great detail but what I, and of course the children were different ages.  So they were, there's a span of, of ages, excuse me.  The, the conditions were, were not great, I don't, I don't think it was, they were living in one room, but they certainly weren't living in a lot of, a lot of rooms.
Speaker 1: So she didn't talk about you know who bunked with whom or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.
Speaker 1: That was not part of the conversation?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But they moved, did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Actually this is interesting--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: My mother tends, because she came to Chicago fairly young, I would say around eight or nine, she tends not to talk a lot about life in North, in North Carolina.
Speaker 1: The--so her father was a sharecropper and other things?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And her mother a homemaker?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Taking care of the twelve children.
Speaker 2: Right (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's possibly a bigger job than her--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --father.  Were there any stories about in, about segregation, abou- we, you mentioned this is during the Depression.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories about you know those realities?
Speaker 2: None that she shared, shared with me.
Speaker 1: And none of her siblings shared with you either?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, and how far back can you trace your mother's family?
Speaker 2: Just to my mother's time, in North, in North Carolina.
Speaker 1: And so you don't have a sense of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Since 1930, '30s [1930s] forward yeah.  So I don't know, for example her father how did he end up in North Carolina?  Had he been in Georgia before or someplace else, in the telling of the story the family shows up full blown in North Carolina, with her being the youngest of the girls.
Story_ID: 662904
Speaker 1: Do you have any indication on either side of your family where there was sla- what, what and was anyone was enslaved?  Or were there were any white members of your family?
Speaker 2: No although both--at, my f- my family on my mother's [Catherine Fulton Williams] side are clearly there had been mixing of the races.  My mother depending on who she runs into is often mis- never an African American would mistake her but (laughter) if you're not African American she's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --often taken not to be African American.
Speaker 1: So at that time, what did she identify as do you know, because many people well black is recent.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: Was she considered colored? Like what--do you know what the self-identification was?
Speaker 2: She al- I guess because of racial segregation, residential segregation both in the South and when she came to Chicago [Illinois], she always identified as whatever the term was (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Whatever it was called.
Speaker 2: Colored, Negro, black, African American, that was never--
Speaker 1: She didn't pass.
Speaker 2: She did not, she didn't, she did not, she did not pass you know.
Speaker 1: In Chicago do you know if because she was light skinned, black person, did she ever encounter that kind of reverse conflict that can occur among blacks when there's different skin tone, tones?
Speaker 2: Interestingly only a--in her early years, I, I don't know.  One quick story as in, in her sixties after she had retired, she been administrative assistant in the Chicago college school system [City Colleges of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  She began to get involved with various community groups, and one of the groups she was particularly interested in was one that focused on African, African heritage.  And the leadership group tended to be African woman who had migrated to Chicago.  And a combination, I think of my mother both being African American and her light skin led her not to be accepted by the group and that, that was quite painful for her.
Speaker 1: After, this is after she (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is like yeah, this is in the six- and she--this was twenty years ago.
Story_ID: 662905
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father [Henry W. McGee, Jr.], his name; spell it for me, his date of birth, where he's from, et cetera.
Speaker 2: Okay great.  My f- do you want me to start with my father or grandfather? We'll start with my father.
Speaker 1: You could, you can start with your grandfather, that's fine.
Speaker 2: Okay, only 'cause the sequence (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah sure and then we'll let's go with the sequence.
Speaker 2: Let's start right, okay.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: Okay, so my grandfather who's Henry Wadsworth McGee, Sr. [Henry W. McGee, Sr.] was born in Hillsboro, Texas in 1910, was small rural city in, in Texas.  I believe that his father's mother had been enslaved, although I couldn't sort of trace it directly for you.  His, his father was a railroad, a railroad worker, which eventually led them to move to Kansas City for work on the, on the road, on the railroad.  My--again very, very poor went to segregated, segregated schools both in Texas and in, and in Missouri.  He was born, the name was given at birth was Wadsworth Beauregard McGee.  Because his mother had a penchant for always naming her sons, and I think he was also from a family of, of, of twelve, giving them the names of gen- of generals.  When he was about thirteen, he discovered that Beauregard [P.G.T. Beauregard] was a famous Confederate general, and so he said he could not go through life with that.  And so he decided to just become Wadsworth McGee, but when he went to his new school in Kansas, they told him that he could not be Wadsworth McGee because he had to have a middle name.  Those--that was just the rule had to have a middle name, and so he then took the name 'cause he had begun to read poetry at that point, Henry Wadsworth McGee.
Speaker 1: So he named himself (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And so that a totally made, named himself.  Otherwise I'd be, still be bearing the name of a Confederate, a Confederate general.  So--
Speaker 1: And where was he in the birth order of the twelve, do you know?
Speaker 2: I think sort of in the middle.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was not the youngest or the, or the, or the, or the oldest, yeah.  So he made it to Kansas City. Sort of struggled through, because he was born in 1910, so in--he sort of pre-Depression [Great Depression] about Wall Street crash is about to happen.  Things are pretty tough, he sort of working part-time trying to go part-time, eventually drops out of high school for a semester.  A relative who had made it to Chicago [Illinois] found out that he had dropped out of school, went crazy, insisted that he go back to school and get his high school diploma.  And then come and joined many other family members who had made it to Chicago at, at this point.  So he, he did that and so at eighteen after he got his high school, finally got his high school diploma in Kansas City, he moved to Chicago.  So again my f- my on both sides my family is part of that Great Migration, one part coming up from Texas.  And the other from North Carolina, West Virginia and then eventually coming to, to Chicago.
Speaker 1: Did you know your grandfather?
Speaker 2: Quite well.
Speaker 1: And did he tell any stories about his time in the South, his experiences of being in the South?
Speaker 2: Yes he talked about--he was quite conscious of segregation and the fact that the conditions and schools that the, the conditions he lived in and the schools he grew up in or attended were very different than those of the whites in Kansas.  You have to imagine what it's like to be the son of a railroad worker, which in the United States in the early 20th century was the embodiment of the seg- segregation system in the U.S. with the Jim Crow cars and so on.  So his, he grew up in a family that was well aware of and part of that whole caught up in that whole, that whole system.
Speaker 1: And he worked on the railroad?
Speaker 2: No his father (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) His father.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: What did his father do on the railroad?
Speaker 2: Lot of physical, he wasn't a porter, he was a physical, you know, fix, fix the trains, that sort of guy.
Story_ID: 662906
Speaker 1: And so your grandfather [Henry W. McGee, Sr.], after getting his high school diploma, moved to Chicago [Illinois] and then what, what did he do?
Speaker 2: Okay, so he then begin to look for work and so one of the jobs that was available to him was selling life insurance door to door, he tried that.  And he eventually applied to the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service]. Now the post office as you know also plays an important role in the evolution of the black middle class--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --because it was one of the few places at the, the time where African Americans could go and actually advance.  Although the question is how far they could advance, but anyway, he started off as a substitute mail carrier.  And then eventually was taken on as a full-time mail carrier, during this process he put himself through, through college at the Illinois Institute of, of Technology [Chicago, Illinois].  Sort of going at nights working, working during, working during the days (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And at this point was he married?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was married at this point, and his wife [Attye Belle Truesdale McGee] and we can talk, this her, her story in a minute, was a school teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he, he's rising up in the ranks at the post office.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And this is around what time?
Speaker 2: This would have been in the mid to late '30s [1930s].
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so now the economy is tanking but he's in a secure job?
Speaker 2: Yes but la- yeah right.
Speaker 1: I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right (laughter) you're right you know.
Speaker 1: All thing--I mean--
Speaker 2: The mail had to be delivered, yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes (laughter) and, and so the mail system continue even as--
Speaker 2: Right, right so how, yes exactly.  Although as you know, well the, the by 19--in the early '40s [1940s] let's see it was late '30s [1930s], early '40s [1940s].  Factory work begin, began to pick up because of, of the war [World War II, WWII], right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what else would like to share about your grandfather?
Speaker 2: Oh let me go, so (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay. So he worked at the post office put himself through got his bachelor's [degree].  At one point he said that he had really decided that he wanted to be a lawyer, but a professor at the school really suggested that his true talent was in management.  And so he decided not to become a lawyer but to stay at the, the post office. He eventually, two things happened.  One he eventually took on more and more responsibility and after a thirty plus year career at the post office in 1966, he was named by the president of the United States to be the first black postmaster of Chicago.  Which given the importance of the po- the post office to blacks in Chicago was almost tantamount, you know, one step short of being mayor.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: And in the (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And this is by Lyndon Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson]?
Speaker 2: Lyndon Johnson right, yeah.
Story_ID: 662907
Speaker 1: And he continued to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --during this span of time, he continued to educate himself, did he not?
Speaker 2: Indeed he did. So he, as part of this growth, he then earned a master's degree in public administration from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: So while he was not encouraged to become a, a lawyer, he certainly was encouraged to develop his management--
Speaker 2: Yes right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) skills.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And he did so.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now I read that--and this is sort of skipping forward a little bit--
Speaker 2: Right okay.
Speaker 1: --but, and everybody was in sa- college at the same time at a certain point, it's not like you're, you're in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, he would, he probably would, he would have been, because everyone was sort of--both my grandfather [Henry W. McGee, Sr.], who you know now that you bring it up, probably was earning his master's at the time that my father [Henry W. McGee, Jr.] was in either college or, or graduate school.  His wife who put herself through--
Speaker 1: Your grandfather's wife (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) teachers college, my yeah, my--
Speaker 1: Your grandmother--
Speaker 2: --grandmother whose name is Attye Belle, A-T-T-Y-E, space, capital B-E-L-L-E, her maiden name is Truesdale, T-R-U-E-S-D-A-L-E, McGee [Attye Belle Truesdale McGee].  Eventually ended up specializing in childhood, in specialize, children with learning challenges, and that was her area of, of, of expertise.  But throughout there was a big emphasis on education in the, in the family from the, from, from the very beginning, yeah.  In both, there were three children, my father who was the eldest; he had two sisters, Sylvia [Sylvia McGee Morrison] and Marguerite [Marguerite McGee Porterfield].  And both the, the girls followed my, their mother in as, as teachers.
Speaker 1: Which was a common path for women (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Path for women, exactly, particularly for African--well women in gen- particularly for African American women.  That was seen as the, sort of surest route, you could always get a job, you know, get a job teaching.
Story_ID: 662908
Speaker 1: My father, I felt as though my f- my--
Speaker 2: And your father's is Hen- Henry McGee, Jun--
Speaker 1: Henry Wadsworth McGee, Jr. [Henry W. McGee, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, he ended if you will fulfilling my grandfather's [Henry W. McGee, Sr.] original goal of being an attorney, but got there in a circuitous route, 'cause that was not his first choice of, of careers.  Growing up he had gone to segregated high schools in Chicago [Illinois] but at one point (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What part of Chicago?
Speaker 1: They grew up on the West Side and then the South Side, the Near West Side and then the South Side.  Ended up doing extremely well in high school, and was admitted what, to the Medill School of Journalism [Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications] at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], and was really interested in a career as a, as a journalist.
Speaker 2: And around what time is this?
Speaker 1: I can tell you exactly, it was 1951, '50 [1950], '51 [1951].
Speaker 2: And when was your father born?
Speaker 1: Thirty-two [1932].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This was in.
Speaker 2: So in, in '51 [1951] he was admitted to Medill?
Speaker 1: No he would've been admitted in '47 [1947], right?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But he went to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right after war [World War II, WWII].
Speaker 2: --Medill for journalism obviously.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, and but that didn't up being--
Speaker 1: Right so--
Speaker 2: His calling.
Speaker 1: You would think as bright as he was, again this was I guess as African Americans we have to keep focused on the, the, the, the possibilities rather than the realities.  But anyway, after graduating from Medill and doing quite well at Medill, he was shocked that none of the white newspapers would give him a job in Chicago.  And so there was a, an organization called the United Negro Press [sic. Associated Negro Press], he since became a freelancer, tried to pull things together.  At this point he had married my mother [Catherine Fulton Williams], talked about before.  And the, I was born in, in '53 [1953] shortly after he, he graduated.  So there was a need for him to do something other than freelance writing.  And so he made the decision as was often the case in the black middle class and others, he, it's get a law degree.  Because you can always practice on your, on your own.  So he ended up in fact getting a law degree he be, later became quite passionate about the subject.  But it was a vocational, it was a choice driven by economics, if you will, it was definitely his second career choice.
Speaker 2: Interesting, because many African Americans chose to become lawyers at that time.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And so your understanding is, it was you could be independent and make money?
Speaker 1: Yes, that what his belief (laughter).
Speaker 2: That was his, okay (laughter).  And what type of law did he practice?
Speaker 1: He originally I think when he first graduated he then went to school in Chicago again 'cause the family is there for support.  He graduated from DePaul law school [DePaul University College of Law] in Chi- in Chicago, eventually went to, a short time at the public defender's office.  Then end, end up working for a downtown law firm, Jesmer Harris [Jesmer and Harris] where he did general corporate law.  But was never totally so he must've gotten out of law school in sort of '57 [1957]. From '57 [1957] to about '67 [1967] he had a respectable and solid career as an attorney.  But I'm not quite sure how passionate he was and so he discovered his true passion in the mid-'60s [1960s] in the with the, the rise of the student protest movement.
Story_ID: 662909
Speaker 1: So he took a--I'm gonna back up just a minute and say that he [McGee's father, Henry W. McGee, Jr.] comes, well he was, he was galvanized by the student protest movement.  And that is because his, his father [Henry W. McGee, Sr.], my grandfather, had been deeply involved in fighting segregation, and thought that it was very important that the family take a leadership role.  So my grandfather was still progressing at the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service], led the postal union [National Federation of Post Office Clerks; American Postal Workers Union] focusing on rights for African Americans, eventually became head of the Chicago NAACP [National Association for the Advancement for Colored People].  And was very, he, my grandfather was very active in civil rights, and so the, the Civil Rights Movement in the early '60s [1960s], early, mid-'60s [1960s] gave my father an opportunity to get involved.  So he took a leave, he went down to Mississippi to help with the--well essentially get them out of jail.  But the, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee [SNCC], the, it's interesting 'cause the, when you think about the role of Johnson in my family's life.  So Johnson (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) President.
Speaker 1: Excuse me, President Johnson, Lyndon Baines Johnson as I said ended up appointing my, my grandfather to be head of the Chicago post office.  He also as part of great s- the Great Society program created something what was called the Office of Economic Opportunity.
Story_ID: 662910
Speaker 1: So you were telling me about the Office of Economic Opportunity and LBJ [President Lyndon Baines Johnson].
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.  So, as part of the Great Society program there was called the Office of Economic Opportunity.  Which was focused on coming up with programs to specific- support poor people in general, but given the income disparity certainly helped the African American community.  Within that, they decided to, it could--became well clear to analysts that one of the problems that African Americans faced and got in the way of their developing economically, were challenges with the legal system. Either mortgages, same thing where you know criminal, unfair criminal arrest and so on.  So they created an office of legal services [Legal Services Program] and my father [Henry W. McGee, Jr.]--I'm not quite sure how he, he, he got this job--but anyway ended up running the legal services office for the--they had regions--for the Mid- for the Midwest region.  And so that, I think, he was really at his--at that, up to then was at his happiest because he could use his law degree, which made his parents [Attye Belle Truesdale McGee and Henry W. McGee, Sr.] very happy.  He was genuinely making a difference to people every day, and he had a secure government job, so it was win, win for, for everyone all around.
Story_ID: 662911
Speaker 1: He had--my mo- at this point he--my mother [Catherine Fulton Williams], we'll go down that path in a minute.  Regrettably he [McGee's father, Henry W. McGee, Jr.] and my mother were divorced when I was five, so they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Are there other siblings before they divorced?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm the eldest and then, well see, yes, and then I a fu- and then I have one full brother who's Kevin Truesdale McGee [Kevin McGee], takes my grandmother's [Attye Belle Truesdale McGee] last name as his, his middle name.  The, so my father then went- began a serious of, of, of marriages, but we were, because everyone was still in the Chicago [Illinois] area we were quite close.  And I saw my father on a regular basis, which is why I can speak so clearly about his happenings (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But you lived with your mother?
Speaker 1: I lived with my mother, yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 662912
Speaker 1: I should ask my father [Henry W. McGee, Jr.] about this, but anyway at some point someone came to him.  And I think perhaps what he realized was, during this period, was that there was a paucity of black attorneys.  And he decided that his next sort of career, if you will, was going to be a law professor.  But it was also clear that because he had gone to a regional law school, DePaul [DePaul University College of Law, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: DePaul.
Speaker 1: --that he was going to need an additional credential, if he was going to really advance in, in academia.  So he in '68 [1968] entered the master's law program at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York].  And in '69 [1969] he graduated and was recruited to join the faculty of UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] as one, as one of the first black law professors there.  I think he either went, either it came with tenure or he, he got tenure very, very quickly.  And while there, again this is, the timing is, is interesting.  Not long after he was there the, there's a great deal of, of turmoil on campus, agitation for a black studies program.  He ended in addition, because he's one of the few black faculty members, in addition to his law, holding down his law school job, was asked to head the black studies program for like a year.  He's always been an intellectual, and so sort of, sort of held that together, and then at the same time [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis was on trial there.  And he got very involved with the committee in Los Angeles [California] writing briefs and doing research to help get her out of, out of prison.  So if he was happy at the Office of Economic, of- the Office of Economic Opportunity, the platform that UCLA provided him, both in terms of fulfilling his dream of, of being a lawyer, helping people and being a part of the, what with the continuing civil rights, human rights battle was, was, was fantastic.  And so he was happier still as a law professor and just retired within the last, interestingly he was at the again a government employee.  Because he was UCLA (laughter). But just to finish that story maybe about ten years or so ago two things happened.  Like most Angelinos he, Seattle [Washington] became a sort of a magical city, and he fell in love with a woman in, in Seattle.  And so moved from Los Angeles, retired as professor emeritus UCLA, moved to the Seattle to take a professorship at the Seattle University law school [Seattle University School of Law, Seattle, Washington], and retired from there a couple of years ago.
Story_ID: 662913
Speaker 1: So when he moved from Chicago [Illinois] to Los Angeles [California] that was then a big break for, away from the family.
Speaker 2: Exactly. Now what's happening about the same time is that my--you know no question the sisters [Sylvia McGee Morrison and Marguerite McGee Porterfield] were there much of his, his family was there.  I think that the, the given the emphasis on education in my family, the fact that my father [Henry W. McGee, Jr.] was a professor at--the fact that my grandfather [Henry W. McGee, Sr.] could go and tell his friends that his, his son, his namesake was a professor of law, the job you know could've been in you know Perth, Australia and it would've been fi- you know fine, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But what about for you, 'cause you were young.
Speaker 2: Ah very important, okay so this plays a very important role for, for me. So this--end that story (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, and we still have to go back--
Speaker 2: Back I know right--
Speaker 1: --to your beginning, but since--
Speaker 2: Right exactly.
Speaker 1: --we're here I just want you to clarify because that, you, you had mentioned that even after your parents split because he still lived in Chicago, you, you saw him all the time and you were close, moving from Chicago to L.A. when you're still a kid--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --I mean how old were you when you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was sixteen.
Speaker 1: Well so--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so this is still your--
Speaker 2: Right but so let me--
Speaker 1: This is an important time--
Speaker 2: So, so since we're here we're gonna come in the middle of the, the movie, if you will, but at some of these begin if you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Come back let, let's say.  This is an extremely pivotal time in my life, about sixteen or seventeen. The, I was a teenager; I was a sophomore in high school [Horace Mann High School, Gary, Indiana].  And it's up to, it's no one's fault because you know living with a teenager can be, can be difficult.  But I was not at all getting along with my stepfather [Madison Williams] at the time.  The--as you probably remember in '68 [1968] '69 [1969], '70 [1970] which was the era of Woodstock [Woodstock Festival; Woodstock Music and Art Fair] and Jimi Hendrix and all that, there was no place on the globe that teenagers wanted to be more than in California.  So when I find out that my father, who I remained close to was actually relocating within minutes of Sunset Strip, I spent the next several weeks pleading with my, my mother [Catherine Fulton Williams] and my father to go to Los Angeles.  So for me it was the biggest, you know, one of the most important, in my early life one of the greatest things that could ha- you know if my grandparents thought it was great that he was going, I thought it was fantastic.  And because of the situation with my, my stepfather, my mother who obviously did not want her eldest son to go, felt (unclear) that, that was fine.  And so I moved from the Chicago area and we'll get to where--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: In the Chicago area in a minute to L.A. where I finished, where I finished--
Speaker 1: So it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) finished high school.
Speaker 1: --worked for you (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Good.
Story_ID: 662914
Speaker 1: Okay so we- we've gone from the middle (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right (laughter).
Speaker 1: --we're gonna back to the beginning.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You, you gave a very clear view of your family and your parents [Catherine Fulton Williams and Henry W. McGee, Jr.] and their growing up, now I want you to go back to whatever's your earliest memory.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What would that be?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory was happy, a happy one, was growing up, wellbeing with my mother and father in a relatively small apartment on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois].  And as I said my parents, my, my parents were--I went to a preschool program.  My, my because my grandmother [Attye Belle Truesdale McGee] and my aunts [Sylvia McGee Morrison and Marguerite McGee Porterfield] on my father's side, we'll talk about my mother's side in a minute, had, were, were teachers, they all had friends who were teachers, so I was in, I remember a very sort of great preschool program.  A woman named Mrs. Harrison [ph.] who was, you know, much beloved.
Story_ID: 662915
Speaker 1: And my--those early years were, were quite happy.  And my parents did a lot I think to protect me and my, my brother [Kevin McGee] from any sort of fal- as I said I saw my father [Henry W. McGee, Jr.] quite regularly.  And then as it turns out again it's extraordinary, extraordinarily lucky life. Just as I was sheltered, if you will from any sort of trauma about my father leaving the Chicago [Illinois] area,  just as I was becoming a teenager and trying to figure who I was gonna be as a man, you know we talked about that.  When I was five years old and my parents got divorced, often in many people's lives that becomes a point of struggle.  Because you have a single woman in this case trying to raise two kids. My mother [Catherine Fulton Williams] had started junior college.  But had, had to leave in order to support the family, because my father was at law school [DePaul University College of Law, Chicago, Illinois].  She worked as a keypunch operator at Consolidated Edison [sic. Commonwealth Edison Company], which was the local electric utility.  But that, again, my parents' divorce allowed two things, two things happen.  One is that it spared me from a moment of any eternal strife and yelling at home, but my mother rather than go out on her own, was actually able to move back in with her family.
Story_ID: 662916
Speaker 1: Which brings me to the story about what, what happened to her, her, her family.  So as I said, Pearl [Pearl Fulton] had moved up first, had brought up the rest of the, rest of the family.  And they lived pretty closely together on the upper West Side [Chicago, Illinois], but it was a very communal family.  It was very much one for all, I'm gonna send back for you or I'll, we're all, we're together.  And the first person to buy house who again had sort of grown up in the, the beauty trade was my aunt Pearl, who bought a house on the west, the West Side, actually not far from where the Bulls [Chicago Bulls] play now.  Her parents [Nellie Fulton and Winston Fulton] bought a house right across the, right across the street. The--we then began, they then to sort of parse out who was going to do what.  So one of the sisters who was considered particularly bright and ambitious Josephine [Josephine Fulton], who I think was the, in birth order is the daughter directly ahead of my mother [Catherine Fulton Williams], was encouraged to go to college and became a teacher eventually became a principal in the Chicago school system [Chicago Public Schools].  The youngest, the next youngest boy, Langston [Langston Fulton] was also sent to college, you know became an AKA [sic. Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] (laughter) later became a, a, teacher.  And so, so there was a range of everyone had to work, but there was right, but those, those who were bright and had an aptitude, the family made it possible for them to go to, to college.  And for those that wanted to go to work in a factory or something like that was fine.  The women were either entrepreneurs or, or--
Speaker 2: Educators (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) school educators, but it was--I can really relate to the raisin in the sun play ['A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry].  There was a near western suburb called Maywood [Illinois] that for some reason in the early '60s [1960s] had begun to be open to blacks buying property there.  So the first, you know saving up the money, first my grandparents bought a house, huge house on a corner lot in Maywood.  So very nice sort of inner suburb, beautiful park across the, the street, really lovely old Chicago [Illinois] suburb, so they bought a house.  Her, directly across the alleyway it wasn't, it was like a nice alley, it's alleyway it's probably too, too, not nice enough term for it.  One of her, one of mother's eldest siblings, Hazel [Hazel Fulton] and her husband bought a house.  The family bought, if you're going north, the family bought an adjacent empty lot that happened to be empty, and was beautifully landscaped.  And then on the lot after that her, next to that, the eldest boy, Lloyd [Lloyd Fulton]--man--Lloyd who had followed his father into factory work and saved enough money to buy his house.  So the Fulton family controlled about a third of the block in, in--
Speaker 2: Maywood (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in Maywood, and so when my mother who at that time about twenty-five whatever became divorced, the, the natural thing for the family was come back home.  You know there's tons of room--
Speaker 2: Sure
Speaker 1: --the park for the kids, the school is, we could see the school, Washington School [Washington Elementary School, Maywood, Illinois] from the front porch of the house.  And so I say all that to say rather than have a situation where I had no man in the home, I had anywhere from six to ten role models, who by the way--I think is important for my growing up--went to work this for, again fort- I'm extremely fortunate, went to work every day.  One, you know couple would put their papers in their briefcases to go off and teach school.  Some would pack the lunch bucket to go to schoo- go to work at the aluminum factory.  So it was, and then everyone would come home. The doors weren't locked, you know, everyone we talk about take a village to raise a, a family (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And where did you live, in which home?
Speaker 1: I lived with, in the grandparents' house.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: In the original house.
Speaker 2: How long did you all live there?
Speaker 1: Okay so I lived there, and that's where I did my elementary school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So you went to elementary school in Maywood?
Speaker 1: In Maywood, Washington School, right. From the time that I was--to fifth grade.
Story_ID: 662917
Speaker 1: Maywood [Illinois] is--how large of a town is it, is it, you know, can you describe it?
Speaker 2: Yeah Maywood is, is a low, the houses are almost brick, generally on a quarter acre plots I would guess.  A- again, I'm sure the town has grown over, over time, but maybe ten or twelve thousand people (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So was it considered a suburban area?
Speaker 2: Yeah very, well yeah.
Speaker 1: And was it African American?
Speaker 2: No we just said there were Af- in the earl- it has become 100 percent African American now, but at the, the time, the, there were African American areas.  But there were very much--whites still lived in Maywood, 'cause it's the '60s [1960s] still.
Speaker 1: So this is in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so this is the--
Speaker 2: Early '60s [1960s] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) the beginning of integration in the sense of being ab- being able to buy in--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --those neighborhoods.
Speaker 2: Exactly and I, I don't know why Maywood was one of the, the big questions why was, was--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Maywood fir- well among the very first, and I--I--
Speaker 1: And you don't know the answer to that.  But, but certainly the early '60s [1960s] is when that opening became available to even--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --legally be able to buy a house.
Speaker 2: Right, now interest- it's interesting, people determine interest.  The school that I went to, Washington [Washington Elementary School, Maywood, Illinois] which was named after [President] George Washington was an all black school.  'Cause I can remember quite vividly that a white student showed up once and for, for a brief period of time.  And wasn't, it wasn't a matter of hostility but it was like sort of a curiosity you know why are you sort of, here (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because the school was predominately black?
Speaker 2: Black yeah, yeah, and I think--
Speaker 1: And what was the education like? Did, did, you know sometimes there're lots of stories of marginal educational when it's largely a black school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think in Maywood at the time and again, I suspect the schools are not, I wouldn't be surprised that the schools were as good as they were now.  But in those early days and you gotta remember this is '60 [1960], '58 [1958], '59 [1959], '60s [1960s], it was a reasonably solid suburban elementary, elementary school.
Story_ID: 662918
Speaker 1: And then at some point you went to school in Gary, Indiana.
Speaker 2: Yes exactly so how did that happen?  Okay so, my mother [Catherine Fulton Williams] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cause that's going south.
Speaker 2: In different directions, right exactly, that's exactly (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Way south, comparatively.
Speaker 2: Exactly, right you know we're gonna talk about that, right.  So my mother, who had moved back in with her family and this was, she was about twenty-five or so, when you know this is all very lovely.  And you know I liked hanging out with mom and pops and brothers and sisters here but I am a young woman in my, my twenties.  So this can't go on for, forever.  So she met and fell in love with a fella named Madison Williams, M-A-D-I-S-O-N, Williams, who was a social worker in the Gary, Indiana school system.  And so she re- she married him in 1963 and we moved to--to Gary. So where did we move into Gary?  Gary at the time was extremely--again this is '63 [1963]. Gary was in no this is six- yeah about '63 [1963], '63 [1963].  Gary was an incredibly prosperous town. U.S. Steel [United States Steel Corporation] had a big--this was when the U.S. was and it's, at its strongest.  The conflict in Asia was going on, lots of steel was needed for the, for the war effort, and there was a big black community of workers who worked in the steel plants.  There was a professional class that had come, grew up to support them, so there were black lawyers, dentists and so on.  But the housing was strictly segregated, so there was a, a black Gary and a white Gary. But everyone by those standards, because the steel mills and all the indus- industrial activities there, was doing relatively well.  I wanna say relatively well.  So I went to, so we moved into a development called Tarrytown [Gary, Indiana] that been specifically--they wanted to encourage a lot of black veterans to move there, and my stepfather was a veteran.  So we moved into a small home, corner lot, it was not exactly prefab, but it was all, everything had been, all the houses were uniformed.  They were put on preformed concrete blocks but were nice homes, so we lived in a two bedroom home.  One for, one bedroom my mother and stepfather, which is, we turned out three bedroom, one bedroom that my brother [Kevin McGee] and I shared.  My stepfather was really focused, who had gone to Prairie A and M [Prairie View Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas], a historically black college [HBCU].  Had a real emphasis on reading and literature and loved Shakespeare [William Shakespeare], so the third bedroom--and I wasn't resentful, no one was resentful about it--the third bedroom was set aside as a family library.  So I mean in theory my bro- and maybe you know my brother would've moved in there at some point, but no, the kids shared a bedroom, so we can have a library.  And there was a, a dining room, living room and, and kitchen.  So the school, and then again to show you how segregated it, it was, the school I went to which is relatively new and was built to serve this black area, the name of the elementary school was Alain Locke Elementary School [Alain L. Locke Elementary School, Gary, Indiana].  Interestingly Locke [Alain LeRoy Locke] was a Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] Ph.D. which will play a role later in, Harvard played a role in my life, important role, and Locke was the first black Rhodes scholar.  So I actually went to (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you were aware of it at, at that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah I was, we were aware that Locke was an important black intellectual.  I mean to the extent that you're ten years old and you're aware of that, you know that it's named after an important black person.  How important at, at ten I don't think it dawned on me.
Story_ID: 662919
Speaker 1: So this Tarrytown area of Gary [Indiana] was a great exemplar of the impact of racial segregation on housing in that you had a neighborhood where obviously I was--my stepfather [Madison Williams] was working for the school system.  Around the corner was a very prominent black dentist, there was a great deal of excitement when he brought, when he brought home a brand new Mustang [Ford Mustang].  And we lived in that community, a very segregated world, talent shows were very big.  I can still remember seeing a, the Jackson family at a talent show at local, local, local high school.
Speaker 2: And this would be in the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 1: The '60s [1960s] yeah this about '66 [1966], '67 [1967] or so you know, and I still remember when Diana Ross came to Gary and discov- (air quotes) discovered the, The Jackson, The Jackson 5 at a big, big concert in, in Gary.  But no one at then knew that they were gonna big as big as they were, they were you know very talented family playing in talent shows.  But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In local talent shows and--
Speaker 1: Yeah the local talent shows--
Speaker 2: --around town.
Speaker 1: Right, exactly, exactly. In fact I believe their first, one of their first records was locally produced on the Steeltown label [Steeltown Records], Gary was als- often known as, also known as, as, as Steeltown.  So when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So you, for you as a child who's lived in suburbia--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --in Illinois to move to Gary in the south, predominately black neighborhood different school you know was that an unsettling experience for you?  How, how did you--
Speaker 1: No again because Gary is about a sixty minute drive, forty-five to sixty minute drive from Chicago [Illinois], so in a way it was little and there was a, a train that went between Gary and downtown Chicago.  It was a little bit more inconvenient for my mother [Catherine Fulton Williams] to see her family, and for me to see my father [Henry W. McGee, Jr.], but because of the train and other things, people just, just dealt with it.  And the--Gary was not near--because of Gary's--and Gary's a big, I'm a say a midsize industrial city so it's not the suburbs.  But--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but the, again it was the same African American demographic mix of dentists, lawyers and steelworkers.
Speaker 2: Okay. So it was sim- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All the same--
Speaker 2: --very similar?
Speaker 1: Very sim- yeah so very similar--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So it's a different, it's the same community of people just living in a slightly different--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --area.
Story_ID: 662920
Speaker 1: The big change comes at the time, this is again in, when I was in seventh grade, so probably was around '65 [1965], '66 [1966], Gary [Indiana] was under pressure to desegregate its schools.  And as is so often the case in case of desegregation that doesn't mean white kids going, get on a bus going to a black neighborhood.  It meant the black kids on the, going to, going--so the children at Alain--Alain Locke [Alain L. Locke Elementary School, Gary, Indiana] ended, so you had to go, you had--at elementary school--so you had to go somewhere traditionally you've would've gone to the local black high sc- junior high slash high school it's called Tolleston [Tolleston Junior High School, Gary, Indiana].  But now they were opening up some of the, the white schools and would bus you.  And I was offered the opportunity to get put on a bus and go to what was called Horace Mann High School [Gary, Indiana], which was in a wealthier section of Gary, and had a terrific reputation.  So and my stepfather [Madison Williams] who knew the system well felt that it would be a good--you know no one's crazy about getting on the bus.  But was a, a great, a great, a great opportunity.
Speaker 2: And were you a good student?
Speaker 1: I was, if I may say so, I was a very good student.  What I found--when I went to Horace Mann, which was a fantastic experience for me, again interestingly I, I don't know a, again the neighborhear- the neighborhood has since turned all black.  And Gary became, became essentially a black city.  I would say that the, the kids and this may be an era of '60s [1960s] and civil rights, my white classmates made a real effort to get along with us.  I think we were a matter of curiosity. I, I later, for example--and there were other black leaders--I later became president of both my freshman year class and my sophomore year class.  And that was, yeah, so, so the school, so it was a great school environment.  To your point about, I was, I still remember this so clearly in seventh grade English class.  I decide- we were assigned a Great Expecta- 'Great Expectations' the tri- the Dickens [Charles Dickens] book.  And for some reason, I don't know I felt it was too long or too difficult and I wasn't going to, to read it.  And I told the, the teacher that and he said, "Fine." And made it clear that the class wasn't gonna stop because I wasn't going to read.  And they were going to go on and I eventually agreed that I would have to read the book.  And Dickens became one of my favorite, my favorite authors.  But I say that to say that the school was, had a reputation for and was in--and was--was quite, quite intellectually ri- rigorous.
Story_ID: 662921
Speaker 1: You mentioned earlier when your father [Henry W. McGee, Jr.] moved to Los Angeles [California]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you switched schools--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --by moving--
Speaker 2: To--right, so at the end of my sophomore year, so this is one of the--okay so I would say you know why do we have, what are the advantages of integrated schools?  Integrated schools particularly at that time, one is because I had--the Horace Mann [Horace Mann High School, Gary, Indiana] facilities were fantastic.  The teachers were really focused on pushing the students, there were very happy times for me there, so I began to be encouraged to take leadership roles.  But I was also exposed to students who were exposed to all sorts of opportunities and experiences that I, even though had grown up in the black middle class, was not aware of.  And so the most important one that's gonna be quite life changing in a way is gonna come out of what happened there.  So I don't know if we wanna break here or--
Speaker 1: No keep going.
Speaker 2: Okay good.  Okay so when I was a sophomore a--it was early in my sophomore year--a friend of mine; I think she was, I was president of the class.  I think she may have been president of the student council, woman named Debra Johnson [ph.] came back and said, "I had the most fantastic summer." I said, "What did you do?" And she said, "Well I went to a school in Massachusetts called the Mount Hermon Northfield School [sic. Northfield School for Girls; Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts].  And they have summer enrichment programs and it's really great. You should, you should look into it."  I had no idea really about, and I know given the, the knowledge and sophistication of my family would think that's not the case.  But they were so thoroughly midwestern they weren't really aware what was going on, on the, sort of the East Coast thing.  So I looked into it, I talked to my mother [Catherine Fulton Williams] about if I should apply and so on and so forth.  So I did and the summer, that was a big summer so I went to Northfield Mount Hermon [Mount Hermon School for Boys; Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts] for that summer after my sophomore year.  My father was in the--during that period I was applying, my father was sort of back and forth in his negotiating his UCL- UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] deal.  And so when I was at Northfield Mount Hermon that was I think one of the most important intellectual experiences I had.  I took a course on philosophy and I was exposed to a group of students, the students are largely from the East, how Debra got there I don't know how Debra did.  And they were all a year older than I was and really began talking about colleges and, and Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] and Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island] and so on.  I was part of this, but I was younger than them, and so I'm hearing all this.  But I'm really loving this philosophy course who is taught by a fellow Englishman named Abraham Downs [ph.], who was doing this sort of on the side.  Because his--during the summer, 'cause his real job was he was the senior official in the advanced placement program at the, at the College Board.  So I'm thinking, he's head of the advanced placement program, these kids are all talking about going to college next year, and worried about their application.  And somehow I found out in talking with him, they--this, again this is the '60s [1960s] you, you'd never do this again.  That if you could prove that you were college ready, that some colleges would actually take you early, without completing your--your senior year.
Story_ID: 662922
Speaker 1: So I got it into my head as a result of hanging out with the kids at Northfield Mount Hermon [Mount Hermon School for Boys; Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts] and talking with Abraham Downs [ph.] that I was going to go in, apply to college after my junior year.  Because one of the questions that come up, people say well you moved, you only spent one year of high school [Palisades High School] in California [Los Angeles, California] that seems sort of crazy.  Why didn't you just finish the high school, I know it was tough with your stepfather [Madison Williams].  Why just finish high, no, no one moves in their last year, because when the original move, decision came about--
Speaker 2: You thought it was two (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Two years.  So anyway this coinci- my dec- again all this is a sign of the times, right, so schools are desegregating.  So I've decid- I decide that I'm going to apply for entrance for college in the fall of 1970, because of my, you know I'd done well (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Which would've been your senior year in high school?
Speaker 1: Would've been my senior year, right.  Because I'd done--you know a straight A student. I could remember--and now I'm horrified that I did this.  I remember, and I don't know why they, they did this but, a teach- an English teacher gave me a, I think it was it was in my freshman or sophomore year [at Horace Mann High School, Gary, Indiana].  Gave me a B plus and I was so outraged I insisted that both my stepfather and my mother [Catherine Fulton Williams] come to school and we're gonna confront this teacher as to why she could possibly had given me a, a B plus.  It was an outrage that had to be addressed immediately at the highest family level.  Anyway they indulged--they had--she didn't change the grade but just, I did well enough that was actually a big moment that everybody had to come to school to find out why I had gotten the, the, the B plus.
Speaker 2: So you were accepted at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: I'm sorry but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but why was I accepted at Harvard?
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because Harvard did not, although they had, they did take people after their, occasionally, after their junior year.  The year I applied was also the year that the Harvard admissions office brought on a person named David Evans [David L. Evans] who's still at the school and played an important role in my life.  And his goal was to increase the number of African Americans coming to, to the Harvard College.  And so my application to Harvard happened to coincide with his arrival in which he's actively trying.  So the fact that I had great grades other than the, the B plus, I had a strong recommendation from a senior official at the advanced placement program.  And I was applying from California all added up to him arranging for me to, to come after my junior year.  But had it not been for that confluence of circumstances, I wouldn't, I wouldn't, it's quite clear I wouldn't have been there.  I suspect either one or two things would have happened, had, had I stayed in Gary [Indiana] for the two years--again 'cause of the strong midwestern orientation of my family--I probably would've gone to either the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], which is where my grandfather [Henry W. McGee, Sr.] got his master's degree, or Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois]. And if I stayed in California, I'm really, really certain I would've gone to either UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] or Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California].  But again the exposure to the students who were thinking about the Ivy League as a decision set and all these things came together.  And all of those, right, come from the fact that when I had to leave Alain L. Locke School [Alain L. Locke Elementary School, Gary, Indiana], I got on a bus to take me across to the white school in Gary.  Where those white students were exposed to much more than I was in my very happy black middle class life, and then there was this change of events.  And so that's an example really of the power of school integration, and I think what, what it, what it can mean if, if done well.
Story_ID: 662923
Speaker 1: When you were applying to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], did you have a sense of what you wanted to do with your life, what work you wanted to pursue?
Speaker 2: (Pause) No, I suspect that in my early days, because my father [Henry W. McGee, Jr.] was a gr- was a great role model for me, that I would probably--and this would of course made my grandparents [Attye Belle Truesdale McGee and Henry W. McGee, Sr.] happy--that I would become a, a lawyer.  And sort of keep in the family tradition of, of, of public service in one way or another.  What evolved over those years as a freshman in college, because I al- had always been interested in writing.  And I was vaguely aware of my father's foray and brief foray into journalism; I joined the student daily, The Harvard, The Harvard Crimson.  And in that group I dev- quickly developed my some of my closest friends even to this, this day, met my wife [Celia Betsky McGee] on the paper.  In that the, the involvement in The Harvard Crimson was a, so central part of my college experience and shaped my decision early in the, early on there to become a journalist.  Now there was some extern- couple of external factors there, one is in the early--we're just coming off the era of the Pentagon Papers.  Early Watergate--well sort of in the middle of Watergate report, right before it.  And being a journalist was, if you wanna do public service, that was one of the highest callings you could have.  My father who regrettably had his journal- journalistic ambitions thwarted, was quite encouraging.
Story_ID: 662924
Speaker 1: And on the paper I met another--who's an older person who played--a few years, class of '71 [1971] I was class of '74 [1974] so he's not that much older--another African American student, Lee Daniels [Lee A. Daniels] who later went on to be a reporter for The Washington Post, The New York Times and other publications.  So took me under his wing and said he said, "Okay there's The Crimson [The Harvard Crimson] but you also have to think about what you're doing for your, for your summers."  And he said one of, "I had--," he had been an intern at Newsweek magazine, "and you should know that Newsweek has this summer internship program, and you should, you should apply."  So I applied for the Newsweek summer internship program, again at the time the--Newsweek in particular, although--was beginning, was making a stab at integrating, their, their ranks.
Speaker 2: And this is around '71 [1971]?
Speaker 1: This is '71 [1971], right.  So yeah '71 [1971], the, I got a second look (laughter) (unclear). It turns out that at the time Newsweek had one black bureau chief who was the--are you ready for this--the Los Angeles [California] bureau chief. His name is John, John Dotson [John L. Dotson, Jr.].  So John hired me as his summer intern in Los Angeles, great black role model, encouraged me, mentored, mentored me.  And there was no doubt that after that, that's, soph- between my sophomore and junior year that sure I was going to be a journalist.  So I went back to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] for my junior year and with John's encouragement and the other people at Newsweek they said, "Well you need international experience."  So in the summer of 1973, this is in, this in the summer of '73 [1973], I was sent to the London [England] bureau, again a fantastic experience.  And there was another African American who was in London at the time who was working as an intern for Time magazine.  And it's a story that he tells often, people would come up, wherever he went people would come up to him and say, "Have you met Henry McGee [HistoryMaker Henry W. McGee]? Have you met Henry McGee?"  So he's figured that after the fifth time he had been asked that that Henry McGee had to be black.  So this young man Henry Louis Gates, Jr. [HistoryMaker Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr.] made a point of looking me up, we met in London, and we've been lifelong friends ever since.  Because he was an intern at Time and I was an intern at Newsweek in, in London, so we're the only two black interns in--
Speaker 2: In London at that time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in London, yeah.
Story_ID: 662925
Speaker 1: Now while you were at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] who were the other black students who were on campus at the same time, who were some of them (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh my god, so many, right.  Where do I--this is such a great, great class, many again remain close, close friends.  A great friend to this day is Joel Motley who just, distinguished attorney and businessman who just finished up a term as the chairman of human rights, Human Rights Watch.  [HistoryMaker] Neil Brown, who with his wife [HistoryMaker Amsale Aberra] went on to found the important fashion house Amsale.
Speaker 1: Amsale, sure.
Speaker 2: Lewis Jones [Lewis P. Jones III] who is a director at the Carver Bank [Carver Bancorp, Inc.] and successful business person; Carlton Guthrie [Carlton L. Guthrie] who actually as it turns out we knew each other.  We had been at A- Alain Locke [Alain L. Locke Elementary School, Gary, Indiana] together, who went on to found an important auto parts business.  So were many people there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And wasn't Cornel West there at that time?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Who can forget Cornel West? Absolutely, we're very good friends.  Well first of all there weren't that many. I would say there were, in my class, there were rough- this is roughly about a hundred black students.  So we all--if you didn't know each other by the end of the freshman year, you certainly knew everybody by the end (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So there are a hundred black students, how many students in total are there?
Speaker 2: There are at the time there were about six thousand students roughly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But hundred per class right, I mean but we're inte- we're this is rem- this is David Evans [David L. Evans], he's now beginning to, to increase yeah every year, right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: So, for example, in Lee- my, I mentioned my friend Lee Daniels [Lee A. Daniels] who is class of about '71 [1971], if there were twenty-five blacks in his class that would, I would be shocked.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 662926
Speaker 1: Harvard College [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --when, when you were deciding to go there--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --were your parents [Catherine Fulton Williams and Henry W. McGee, Jr.] for it? Did it matter what it cost?  You know some, sometimes that's a barrier (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right. Right that's right, yeah, yeah.  Cost was never an issue given the, the, or two things given the rel- rel- thankfully the relative prosperity of my family.  Although it was quite expensive and I'm not, it's just I didn't have to work--
Speaker 1: But they were--
Speaker 2: --and get aid.
Speaker 1: --but they were--
Speaker 2: That wasn't, that wasn't the issue.
Speaker 1: --prepared to pay?
Speaker 2: I think they were more, because no one, the, the notion of dropping out of high school to go to college was so nov- they were still spending so much time sort of working through that.  And the idea of--because of Harvard's reputation, it all seemed sort of--if I wanted to do that, that's why it all seemed sort of strange.  So let's get this straight he's gonna go to Harvard, but he hasn't finished high school and what?  We--they couldn't really put it all, all together.
Speaker 1: So you had to put it all together?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 662927
Speaker 1: So now you--you are at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], you're being groomed by Newsweek--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and then you graduate?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Do you automatically have a job at Newsweek?
Speaker 2: Yes so they offered me--so this is was great, again I had then eventually became features editor at the--
Speaker 1: At The Crimson [The Harvard Crimson] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At The Crimson, right.  My co- again such a fantastic--the, The Crimson has--many, many of our current journalistic leaders are, came through The Crimson, I got to know them there.  My co-features that are, for example was a woman named Dale Russakoff who later went onto a very distinguished career at The Washington Post and on.  And so I graduated, Newsweek offered me a job first in New York [New York]. Well they just wanted me, "Well sort of come to New York.  You'll work here for a year and or two and we'll just figure it out, but, but come to New York."  And so my first job, 'cause you're in New York, you're a general assignment reporter.  I did stories at the UN [United Nations Headquarters, New York, New York], and you sort of, sort of urba- urban affairs stories, but it was a very rich job, this is June of '74 [1974].  And in November of '74 [1974], the Washington [D.C.] bureau chief called the head of the New York bureau and said--'cause Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] had resigned in August of that year.  So that, "Our, everyone here has been working without vacations, it's totally crazy, you need to send us down here just, just to help."  He says, "Well the only guy that, that I can really let go is this kid who just graduated from Harvard.  But if you only need him for a couple, you know, he seems to be good but you know," (laughter), "that you take, you know buyer beware.  But if you only need him for vacation, you know, fine."  So right around Thanksgiving of that year, I went on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Seventy-four [1974]?
Speaker 2: Seventy-four [1974], I went on a two week vacation relief assignment to the Washington bureau.  And it's again one of those things about mentors and John Dotson [John L. Dotson, Jr.], who had been an important mentor in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  The Washington bureau chief, fella by the name of Mel Elfin, and I got along so well.  He decided simply that I was gonna be his guy, and the only thing he wanted me to do in going back to New York, when I went back to New York at the end of two weeks was to pack my bags and move back, because he was going to make me at twenty-one or twenty-two, a Washington correspondent for Newsweek magazine.  Which is something that you aspire to at forty-two--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --not (laughter) not twenty-two. But again as is so much the case in life, it's being in the right place at, at the right time.  And so had I graduated from college a year later, you know the, so this all came together--
Story_ID: 662928
Speaker 1: So there was huge advantage to--well, an advantage and disadvantage to being so young and being at Newsweek at that, at that point.  The adv- the--tell you about the disadvantage.  Which is when I was thinking about a career in journalism where I should, should start had the opportunity to talk with another Crimson [The Harvard Crimson] editor, who graduated many years from all, before, David Halberstam, who was a reporter for The New York Times and won many awards and was considered one of the greatest journalists in American history.  And I met with him, actually as it turns out in his apart- and I didn't realize that at the time that now I'm living across the street from where we had this interview.  And he urged me not to take the, the Newsweek job but instead to go to work for a local newspaper, any local newspaper.  So that I would really spend some time in the, in the trenches.   He says, "It's all very nice you've worked for Newsweek in London [England] and Los Angeles [California] but you really should spend some time covering a local school board election" (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And what, what--this was when you were--
Speaker 1: Seven- this is in when I was--
Speaker 2: --considering it?
Speaker 1: Yeah I would--when--my last year, so this has been the summer of, this would've been '73 [1973], '74 [1974].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: When I got the, when I got the offer to go to Newsweek's New York [New York] bureau.
Speaker 2: And you talked to Halberstam (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Halberstam, right.
Speaker 2: He's like not so--
Speaker 1: Yeah, "Don't, you--there's time for that. Go to the school board.  Trust me, here's my Pulitzer Prize," (laughter), "you wanna go, you wanna go with the, the, the school, the school board."
Speaker 2: And he clearly you did not listen (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And I said, "I, I hear you David but you know I'm not sure I wanna go, that--quite that direction."  So one of the disadvantages, if you will is that I went in without the Halberstam--
Speaker 2: Seal of approval.
Speaker 1: --rec- rec- recommended training, training program.  The advantage though was that because I was so young, is that I wasn't seen as a threat by any of the, the beat reporters.  So that when they went on vacation, rather than give it--give you an example. The, if White House person went on vacation, the state department person took over.  Not so sure that's the best idea, the twenty-two year old (laughter) you know as you essentially keeping you know the seat warm, and it's no threat.  So at Newsweek, I was the great utility player, so I had a chance to cover the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.], the defense department [U.S. Department of Defense], the state department [U.S. Department of State].  Rode on Air Force One when the White House correspondent was on, on vacation, so it's this wonderful three-year period in Washington [D.C.].  And exposure to what it was li- what it was like to be a, a Washington correspondent, so that was all fantastic.
Story_ID: 662929
Speaker 1: There was also during that period a--and perhaps Halberstam [David Halberstam] was trying to get at that. During that period a sort of disillusionment came in.  Because I had felt in my narrow cocoon of being at The Crimson [The Harvard Crimson] and Newsweek and looking at what would happen with Woodward [Bob Woodward] and Bernstein [Carl Bernstein] and so on.  I had naively assumed that I would show up, write great stories, governments, would fall you know (laughter) and all these great things were going to happen.  But that wasn't actually the day to day nature; you know and after every twelve weeks I got back to you know to school and so.  But that wasn't the, the nature, the nature of the job. But I-- I liked it, but I felt that, and I certainly loved, wanted a career in the media.  But felt that, and maybe also influenced by Elfin [Mel Elfin] in a way because he as a manager, he's a manager and I said you know what?  I want a career in the media but I wanna be on the management side, this day to day journalism thing isn't quite what I thought it was going to, going to be.  And so I made the decision that I was gonna go onto the publishing side of the business, but had majored in something called social studies at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  Which is a mix of philosophy, economics, philosophy and economics, so didn't have much experience in the business world.  So knew that I had to get some additional training, so I applied to Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts] and entered in the fall of se- fall of '77 [1977], not intending to leave the media publishing world at all.  This was--I had a girlfriend, my--at the time where I met on The Crimson. Her, her name was Celia, C-E-L-I-A, last name is Betsky, B-E-T-S-K-Y [Celia Betsky McGee].  Who was also on The Crimson with me, was interested in journalism but also in the, in the arts.  And so when she had graduated from college, she was a year ahead of me class of '73 [1973], she came to New York [New York].  Went to work at the New York Review of Books and decided to pursue a master's degree in, master's hopefully into a Ph.D. program at Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut].  She, because I was in Washington [D.C.], she had spent some time applying for a fellowship at the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution] which had just come through when I had announced I was actually leaving Washington to go back to, to Cambridge [Massachusetts].  So you know that was interesting.  So during that period when I was, had left Washington to go to back to Boston [Massachusetts], my wife, my, what--who eventually become my wife, my girlfriend Celia had moved to Washington.  And she had a great couple years at the Smithsonian, but the reason she was there was because I was there, but then I wasn't, I wasn't there (laughter) you know.
Story_ID: 662930
Speaker 1: So you went to Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts] while she's [McGee's wife, Celia Betsky McGee] doing her program (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Master's program.
Speaker 1: --and the, and the--this is a two year program, correct? At--
Speaker 2: Well, yes right.
Speaker 1: And your intention is to go into publishing, so when you come out--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --what happens?
Speaker 2: Okay. I came out really foc- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What year, and what year is this--
Speaker 2: Class of '79 [1979].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I graduate in nine- which is important you know, to our, to our story.  So in 1979 I'm coming out, I'm looking for a job in publishing, so I, I was talking with Newsweek and other, and other companies.  But at the time the biggest publisher in the United States was Time Inc.  So I said let me go interview at, at Time Inc.
Speaker 1: And Time Inc. is the biggest because it--
Speaker 2: Owns Time, Life, Sports Illustrated, Money. I mean, I mean (laughter).
Speaker 1: Most of the magazines.
Speaker 2: Yeah right most.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Every magazine you know they publish. So monthlies, they--they got it all.  Not only that, at the time, at the time they, not only were they the largest and wealthiest, they were also the most powerful.  And next to winning, I don't think I exaggerate, next to winning the Nobel Prize, the next, the next best thing for someone was to be on the cover of Time magazine, right?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: So just give you an idea of the power of the, of the brand and the magazine at the time.  People watching this now may say, "How can that be"--
Speaker 1: Right but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a huge thing to be on the cover of--
Speaker 1: And the circulation was huge--
Speaker 2: --of Time. Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So I went there looking for a job.  So I make the pitch to them that because I knew the editorial side, I had worked for their competitor.  And knew that, you know, and because I now had the M.B.A., there'd be a limit to the stupid, sort of financial mistakes I can make.  And I would be perfect for them. And believe it or not they bought that and I was offered a, a job.  And at the time they had a sort of informal publisher's training program, so I would've of started in market- marketing which for them is circulation.  Then perhaps moved into ad sales, strategic planning. If I was good, would've been given a, a magazine or group of magazines to be a publisher.  So that was people had done that before it was a, a well worn path.  And in fact my, the year ahead of me, class of 1978 from Harvard Business School, Ann Moore followed exactly that path and became president of Time Inc.  So that--people did that and I was offered that, that opportunity.
Story_ID: 662931
Speaker 1: But they said, "Before you take--very glad you're interested in that. We'd love to have you. But before you take that job--and try not to fall over in laughter when we tell you this.  But we have a brand new, relatively new but whacky subsidiary on the fifth floor of the Time and Life Building [1271 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York].  Who, and I know this is insane, actually think they can get people to pay for television."  It's a company called the Home Box Office, it started in '72 [1972] it had turned its first profit in '77 [1977] and this is '79 [1979].  And so they had decided they were going to bring in a bunch of M.B.- this is a very timing thing--bring in a bunch of M.B.A.'s to really sort of make the company go.  "So, so we want you to go down and talk with the person, we don't know--," this is the magazine.  They're, they're still skeptical with this thing is ever going to, to make it, but anyway they are a great believer that the two people who are running it, a fella named Jerry Levin [Gerald Levin] and Nick Nicholas.  Both have huge careers ahead of them at, at what was then Time Inc.  Both of them, by the way, later went on to run the, the company at, all of Time Inc. at, at different, different times became Time Warner [Time Warner, Inc.].  But, "Said you really wanna talk with Nick because he went to Harvard Business School and you know you guys should chat."  So I went down and I talked with Nick as well as a person who, who was on his team named Tony Cox [Winston Cox] who'd also gone to Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts].  And they painted this picture about you know the future's television and you know Time is great; sure you can take that job.  But you really should come and work here, and I was one of nine M.B.A.'s that they brought on from different schools that year.  But five of them were from my business school class at Harvard alone.  So again an example (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So people you knew well?
Speaker 1: --of being at the right time, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well and was it known at this time and, or was it even true that Time the, the umbrella company spent a lot of money cultivating things.  Whether they came to fruition or not, I mean they--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --certainly come to be known as a company that will spend a lot of money to, to test something out, was that known at this point?
Speaker 1: It was known and that was one of the comforting things (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right that's why I'm asking.
Speaker 1: --is that--
Speaker 2: You mu- you would fall soft potentially?
Speaker 1: Fall soft. And here's the other th- yes that, that was true, and importantly for me and I think this was different than most of my cla- or all of my classmates.  The--I knew if the HBO thing blew up, I'd actually come in the building for a different job altogether, and I'd be perfectly happy taking the job that I was originally offered.  So there was never for me, there was no people say well it's a big career risk, it was ve- you know very special time and place for me.  It, of all my classmates, it was perhaps the least, the least risky for me (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because you had already gotten a job offer, you'd knew that they liked you.
Speaker 1: Right and I knew that I could do that job.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know.
Story_ID: 662932
Speaker 1: So you--you take the leap--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and go to Home Box Office--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) as it's then known.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) right.
Speaker 1: And, and as I recall Home Box Office started with fights or sports.
Speaker 2: The original program, it's focus--well the original concept of Ho- which was called Home Box Office, it was the first place you could see uncut movies in the--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in, in the home. So the idea--obviously we'll talk about this technology--has, has changed.  And original programming for which it has come to be known was not an important part of the business model at all.  It was all based around feature films and creating this, this box office if you will in the home.  Sports were important, and particularly boxing which was a big, and people don't realize, boxing was an important sport in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was huge then yeah.
Speaker 2: --late '70s [1970s], early '80s [1980s]. So that was a way of drawing attention but it wasn't unlike entertainment's ESPN you know sports network.  It wasn't set up as sports, that was sort of an add on but it wasn't--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --central. It was all about the, the movies, and in fact not many years after I was there, the person who was the chairman of HBO became chairman of the, the company, a guy name Michael Fuchs, and head of the film department a guy named Steve Scheffer were featured on the cover of The New York Times Magazine with the headline, "The Company that Ate Hollywood."  Because HBO becomes so, Home Box Office, HBO, becomes so important to, to Hollywood, so--
Story_ID: 662933
Speaker 1: As one of these nine M.B.A.'s who comes in to share your wisdom, what are you all doing? What, what's happening (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, different, different things. Well so, so again this was the advantage, I joined HBO [Home Box Office] when it had fewer than 3 million subscribers.  It was a single network that wasn't on twenty-four hours a day. Our--the technology at the time was so crude that our affiliates in Hawaii and Puerto Rico couldn't receive the satellite signal.  And we used to have to package up the movies on large cassettes, ship them to them, and they originate HBO locally.  And as I said fast, original programming really wasn't on the, the map.  Flash forward to today, HBO is a global network with well over a hundred million subscribers.  The majority of which by the way are outside the U.S., and is as evidenced by Sunday's Emmy Awards is the most important force in originally scripted programming in the telv- in, in the television industry.  So all that hap- all that was to come, but when I showed up, it was all about movies.  They had all these M.B.A.'s and they sort of sorted them out into different, different jobs.  And because I had been a, a writer, they felt that I could sort of talk, talk with the crazies if you will, out in, in Hollywood.  And because I had the, the M.B.A. I could presumably negotiate with them, so I was given a job for which I was wholly unqualified.  Which was negotiating the rights to independently produced films and foreign language films for exhibition on this service that wasn't even on twenty-four hours, twenty-four hours a day.  Show, again, shows you how old, long ago HBO even no longer shows foreign language films on its main show, it's got other, you know.  So this was an unbelievable opportunity for me.
Speaker 1: And you're about how old now?
Speaker 2: I was probably twenty-seven or so.  Time Inc. is a very wealthy company, everything always had to be done top drawer.  So at twenty-seven I was essentially given a credit card and unlimited amount of first class tickets.  And told that I had to stay at the Beverly Hills Hotel [Beverly Hills, California] and correctly represent the company.  And buy as many independent and foreign language films as, as I could.  So that was also at the beginning of the birth of the American independent film business.  So to have that sort of checkbook and power--yeah pay television was a very important sort of financing stream--put me at the beginning of that movement.
Story_ID: 662934
Speaker 1: But what really supercharged things was in '83 [1983] when HBO [Home Box Office]--which had been involved in all sorts of film financing. They had for example this, the studio that you know now as TriStar [Columbia TriStar Pictures], the reason it's called TriStar, 'cause it was actually founded--'cause it couldn't come up with better name--was founded by HBO, CBS and Columbia Pictures who all had equal shares and so they come up with the name TriStar.  And HBO had been very involved in film financing; I was sort of there during that period.  But in '83 [1983], the company, which had done a lot of business with a British company called Thorn EMI, decided they were gonna go into what was then a brand new business called home video.  Figuring that they are already involved in film financing why don't they sort of extend that, get involved in, in that, the, the home video business.  So they formed a joint venture called Thorn EMI HBO Video.  I went, helped put that together and then went on the board of that as to overseeing HBO's financial interest in it.  And back home I, my day job back at HBO was acquiring films to be distributed through this, this, this, this joint venture.  And that was very much at the beginning of the independent film business. So we put a lot of money into Miramax--a, a number of--of independents.  So, for example, Bob [Bob Weinstein] and Harvey Weinstein who founded Miramax, they tell them story themselves that HBO's early investment in their films made all the difference in sort of the growth of their company.  I could remember crazy days with Harvey Weinstein, even though I had other meetings, this is at the--you know going to the Cannes Film Festival every year.  Even though I had other meetings, Harvey insisting that I come up to his room.  Because he had hot new film called 'The Grifters' with John Cusack, Annette Bening that we had to buy, had to see immediately.  With Harvey, he's a force of nature sort of go along--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --with it, so.
Story_ID: 662935
Speaker 1: So let me ask, when you, when you say that you're investing in independent films--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and you mentioned Miramax.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Is it that when HBO [Home Box Office] puts money into the film you get the fi- as soon as it's out of circulation it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Out of theaters because we get the--
Speaker 1: Net- out of theaters that come--
Speaker 2: --we get the home video out of pay television rights--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and those became very important ways for them to finance their films.
Speaker 1: So this relationship which is the, the post-theatre--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --usage of the films, prior to that what was happening to films after they left the theatre?
Speaker 2: They would typically go to--well before pay television, they simply went to television, right, and so you'd have a movie of the week, televisions were, again it's hard to believe that this during our lifetime, but yes.  But on Sunday night rather than original programming the networks would all have big theatrical films to show (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And then too isn't this also the time when, I even can't remember the names of these businesses, but where you would rent videos?  So what becomes--
Speaker 2: Oh yes so this is, so, so how, so the video business evolved initially as a, again people watching this may not realize this.  But the original home entertainment business as you know it involved--
Speaker 1: Blockbuster [Blockbuster Entertainment, Inc.; Blockbuster LLC].
Speaker 2: Blockbuster, right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: People involving--there is a half inch tape, there were two different formats one was called VHS [video home system] and the others called Betamax remember that?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And what people would typically do is, there'd be huge stores that were publically traded companies like Blockbuster and there were others.  Where it became a habit ingrained in the U.S. entertainment life of a, of a family is that every weekend they would go to--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --their local Blockbuster, Movie Gallery [Movie Gallery, Inc.] or whoever they were renting from and rent, rent it, rent a, rent a tape.
Speaker 1: And this is starting at around the same time, isn't it in the '70s [1970s] when, early '80s [1980s] when--
Speaker 2: It's early '80s [1980s] this is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Early '80s [1980s]--
Speaker 2: --eighty-three [1983] yeah, '83 [1983] yeah I mean--
Speaker 1: When that becomes pop--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --popular for families to do. When HBO comes in and creates this deal with the independent film companies, how, how is that business affected, or is it part of it's, the food chain (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well no, no cou- well, well coup- it's, it's part of the, the, the ecosystem.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But a couple of things are going to happen both in the, the business world and the technology world that are going to shift things.  And again have a profound effect on both HBO and a result, of my, my career. The--without taking too dive, deep a dive into this.  There's a concept in U.S. law called the first sale doctrine that essentially allowed--once a video store bought a tape and they, they could talk, they were free to rent it at whatever price they wanted to.  And didn't have to share the proceeds with the, with the cop- with the copyright owner.  So that led to a business which let their own business that the studios would distribute, would typically price the first version of the tape at seventy, eighty dollars or more.  Which no one would buy it but that was simply to capture the revenue from all the rentals that, that were going to happen a, along, along the way.  Two things are gonna happen simultaneously. One is that business is gonna be so--become so large that the studios decide that they don't understand why independents like HBO are in that business at all.  And they're gonna take, they're going to take it over. So before an independent producer could put together a package, to get financing from HBO and then have a Columbia [Columbia Pictures] or Paramount [Paramount Pictures Corporation] distribute that, the studio says that's nuts, we're putting in all the effort, HBO's making all the money.  So they figured that out, so the supply of independent films that were available to distribute, distributed, changed.  At the same time you had the invention of the digital video disc or, or DVD.  Which then allowed the--that gave birth to what we call the sell through business or people could actually purchase a disc at a much lower price.  And driven by Walmart [Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.] and other retailers the DVD became the dominant form of, of home entertainment.  And it shoved--because people could own this disc at a relatively low price (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what, what year is this?
Speaker 2: --it got rid of the rental market.  I should know this; this is in the mid-'80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Oh this in mid-'80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: No, I'm sorry, I mean the--mid-'90s [1990s], sorry.
Speaker 1: Mid-'90s [1990s] right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Mid-'90s [1990s] right.
Story_ID: 662936
Speaker 1: So, DVDs [digital video disc] transformed--so now there's some important shifts for HBO [Home Box Office] because the home entertainment business is becoming huge for the studios and it's not unusual for the films' DVD sales to actually be more profitable to the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.
Speaker 1: --studios, than the, than the bo- than the, than the box office and so--
Speaker 2: And just for a context, at this point, now we're at, we're in the mid-'90s [1990s], what is your role at HBO?  Because you've--
Speaker 1: I'm still acquiring for our business, for our home entertainment business, which is becoming increasingly challenged as the studios push to take over more and more of that business.
Speaker 2: And are you, but are you in charge at this point?  When do you become president?
Speaker 1: Became president in '94 [1994], '95 [1995].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: So this around that time. So you're in charge of the whole thing.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And technology is changing rapidly all around us.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You are figuring at--well you, you're ahead of the curve in terms of the studios, but now they're figuring it out (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: So like wait a minute.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And where in this mix is direct to DVD happening? Has it already begun?
Speaker 1: Direct to well--
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) it started off some independent producers realize that you can actually, you lose money sometimes in theatrical.  So during the tape era there were films that went, what we call direct to videos, skip--
Speaker 2: Direct to video, right.
Speaker 1: --the theatrical.  The DVD hastened that and it was many films did not--had only a token theatrical release, but got most of their revenues from--from DVD.  And DVD became so important that Hollywood changed how they distributed films.  So to your earlier point, films typically went from theater to broadcast television, then when paid television came along, they went theatres, pay television, broadcast, ad supported television.  But with the arrival of home entertainment, the studios put in another distribution window ahead of HBO, which was the home entertainment window.  So HBO as a network found that its main consumer proposition which was being the first place to see uncut movies in the home, was no longer true.  And in fact the place to see, the first place to see an uncut movie in the home was either to go to Blockbuster [Blockbuster Entertainment, Inc.; Blockbuster LLC] and rent it, or go to Walmart [Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.] and, and buy it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And buy it.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And this is at about what year?
Speaker 1: This is the very late '80s [1980s], 1990, I'm sorry I keep saying--the very late '90s [1990s], early 2000s.
Story_ID: 662937
Speaker 1: So does this result in a crash in your business?
Speaker 2: No.  Because HBO [Home Box Office] early on had begun to experiment with original programming as a way of bolstering the, the movies.  And it had some early success in attracting stories and artists who would otherwise feel stymied by the additional rules of, of television.  And so the--HBO's first biggest, they had done other original series, but it with sort broke into the public consciousness and revolutionized tel- television as we know it.  Almost simultaneously with the release of 'The Sopranos' and 'Sex and the City,' both of which were huge cultural phenomenon and (unclear).
Speaker 1: And when were released, each of them?
Speaker 2: Each of them were about 1990, about 2000, sorry.
Speaker 1: So to huge acclaim both series--
Speaker 2: And it signaled the arrival of a whole new type of programming, where the stories weren't cut to fit the commercial time breaks.  Where writers were free to explore subjects that hadn't been explored, explored before. And that began a virtuous circle. The more that HBO succeeded the more Holly- it attracted the attention of Hollywood, Hollywood players.  At the same time, again it's a big ecosystem, there's something going on in the, in the movie business, as well.  It, as that, it becomes increasingly, as the movie business becomes increasingly global, the studios begin focusing very much on large big budget films.  And sort of middle level or lower budget films that they had sort of done before, become less interesting to, to them.  So the artists, the directors, the actors and so on who, who have traditionally done some of their greatest work at studios, find that HBO becomes a, a place for them to a, a place for them to come.  And so each year began, begins to grow and we're now in, we're having this, this interview in 2016.  And I think that every year for the last fourteen years, that's about 2002, HBO has had more Emmy nom- Emmy [Emmy Award] nominations and more wins than--
Speaker 1: For original programming (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) any original program than, than, than any network.
Speaker 1: And--
Story_ID: 662938
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Name some of the programs apart from 'The Sopranos' and 'Sex and the City.'
Speaker 2: Well in the early days there were programs like 'Oz,' a very important series, eight or ten, eight years ago was 'The Wire' so much so that President Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] talked about it, talks about it being one of his favorite television shows.  One of the ones the with the--Sunday's Emmy Awards a show called The Game of- 'Game of Thrones' went into record books as the show which has won more Emmy Awards than any series in history.  So it's been a, and on the, hugely important movies.  Now one of the things that HBO [Home Box Office] did which is important for me as an African American executive there.  Is because it need- the network needed to differentiate itself from what was on air, there was a, often a focus on stories related to African Americans.  So the sh- early on, HBO featured, did stories on Dorothy Dandridge ['Introducing Dorothy Dandridge'], Josephine Baker ['The Josephine Baker Story'], the, and there was a, there was a, the, we did a television series with the Hudlin brothers who did--
Speaker 1: Warrington [Warrington Hudlin] and Reggie [HistoryMaker Reginald Hudlin].
Speaker 2: Warrington and Reggie Hudlin. So would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And how successful were these African American focus projects?
Speaker 2: They were quite popular and African Americas by the way account--(unclear) away, but when I was there African Americans counted for a good quarter of the viewing of, of HBO.  So double the, the percentage of the population.
Story_ID: 662939
Speaker 1: I wanted you to talk a little bit about the leadership in the, in HBO [Home Box Office] and HBO's still under the umbrella I guess at this point is it--?
Speaker 2: Of Time Warner [Time Warner, Inc.], so the company has, has morphed (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cause it's morphed. Right?
Speaker 2: The company has morphed, so just a little bit on that, so I started off when it was Time Inc.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Time then merged with the big Hollywood studio Warner Brothers [sic. Warner Communications, Inc.], called Time Warner. They--that company then merged with another company run by a giant in the business, Ted Turner.  Turner brought TBS, Turner Broadcasting System [Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.] and then in the year 2000, the company went through a huge change in that it merged with or was purchased by a large Internet company AO- AOL, America Online [America Online, Inc.; AOL, Inc.].  The theory at the time was that you could marry their digital distribution with all the Time Warner content, it would all work out.  Huge clash of cultures, hundreds millions of dollars of wealth were wiped out.  And even to this day, it's cited as one of the worst, if not the worst mergers in U.S. corporate history.
Speaker 1: And who was, who was guiding the ship when that merger--
Speaker 2: Jerry Levin [Gerald Levin] who's one of the first people who recruited me to, to HBO.  With the demise (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So when did Dick Parsons--
Speaker 2: Well I was gonna say, with the demise of the, with the demise of that merger in 2000, Jerry left and [HistoryMaker] Richard Parsons, who's probably I'm sure this (unclear) who is one of the greatest U.S. executives ever.  And certainly a role model to any and all African American executives came in and sort of righted the, righted the ship.  And he's known as sort of Mr. Fix It.  He had been involved in the comm- he had been on the board of directors so knew, knew the company.  And since then--just to finish this story--the company's been through many changes, AOL was sold off, it's much diminished.  And is now a, wholly a subsidiary of Verizon [Verizon Communications, Inc.].  The company separated out Time Inc., which is now whol- a separate publically traded company which happened in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And that occurred in--
Speaker 2: --the last two years.
Speaker 1: --fourteen [2014] I think, right?
Speaker 2: Right two years, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Which essentially means the, they sold off their magazine publishing--
Speaker 2: The publishing company, right.  So the company now that H- even though HBO started off at Time Inc., the Time Warner that exists today is the three main businesses.  There's HBO which is the global pay television network, Warner Brothers, which, depending on the year, is number one or two studio.  And TBS or the Turner networks which are huge group of networks ranging from CNN to TBS and TNT and everything in between.  So that--that's the company today (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Story_ID: 662940
Speaker 1: You spent the lion's share of your career--
Speaker 2: Right, thirty-four years, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: --thirty-four years at HBO [Home Box Office] under, all of this change is happening--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --about--as HBO is rising. And, and at the same time technology is making such a huge change constantly.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How are you as the leader of HBO kind of riding these various tides?
Speaker 2: Well that wou- that was very exciting and every day in a way I thought thank god I decided to take the HBO job.  'Cause it was an issue of managing growth and challenges where the growth that the people had taken the Time Inc.--the, the people had taken the Time Inc. door were, were managing a very different scenario.  So that choice that I made in 1979 seemed relatively inconsequential at the time, but would later prove to be hugely important.  Now in terms of technology, that has been hugely important to my career. One of the things--I'm now teaching back at Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts]--one of the things I, I tell the students is to focus on getting general business, general business skills.  And not worry about specific industries. Because when I was a student at Harvard Business School, scientists had not yet figured out a way to affix a motion picture to a five inch plastic disc.  It literally, no one in the world had thought about that, yet it would change everything we know about entertainment.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And be essential to my career, and as I se- as when I think about the transitions first from the tape business to the physical digital disc, when I left HBO I was spending a third to a half of my time focusing on HBO's move into digital distribution via downloads at Apple [Apple Inc.] and Amazon [Amazon.com, Inc.] and, and others.  And so I've seen the, how technology can affect whole industries and make, and make big changes.
Story_ID: 662941
Speaker 1: Under your watch, HBO [Home Box Office] expanded globally.
Speaker 2: Yes that was very important to, to me. I guess I've always--or two things are going on.  One is I think in general you are--I was aware of the, the growing importance of the international market.  Certainly I'd traveled to international film festivals as part of my job.  My wife [Celia Betsky McGee] is American but she was raised in Holland, so we would go back to the Netherlands quite frequently.  So I was, and I spent in the time in the lil- the, the London [England] bureau.  But it was clear to me that one of the big areas of growth for HBO was gonna be international, particularly once we had original, original programming that we had made an we--we controlled.  And DVD [digital video disc] was an--it gave us the technology to do that, but the real breakthrough for, for growth came with the arrival of digital distribution.  Which allowed us to get into many more compet- many more countries more quickly.  So, for example, when we were doing a disc release of 'The Sopranos' in Central Europe, essentially to make it cost effective, we would have to wait until we had the German version and the French version that could go on the same, the same disc.  This is manufacturing.  With digital distribution, you cut off those costs and so you can do many more things in terms of marketing and release without all the, the cost.  So the arrival of digital distribution has made a big, a big difference.
Story_ID: 662942
Speaker 1: So after thirty-four years in 2014, you leave?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Okay, again based on a, a conversation.  Let me just take a break here and I'll come back and tell that story for you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: As a result of what I was doing at HBO [Home Box Office], I really became immersed in films and obsessed with, with films.  I joined the board of Sundance Institute [Park City, Utah], I was president of the film society at Lincoln Center [Film Society of Lincoln Center, New York, New York].  So was very much, I was focused on a lot of HBO's original programming, was very much aware what was going on in the film world.  And I noticed that in the last ten years or so that the American documentary film community had been come, become obsessed with the idea about making films about American business.  And not only were those films getting fair- relatively large audiences for documentary films, but they were winning all sorts of awards.  So you'd watch the Academy Awards [Oscars] each year and the winner is 'An Inconvenient Truth,' the winner is 'Inside Job.'  Films like 'Super Size Me' are coming quite popular.  So that's sort of interesting phenomenon.  My daughter, whose name is Honor McGee [Honor McGee], H-O-N-O-R and her friends I know are very visually orientated.  And so I asked myself is there a way that I could use these films to give students an, sort of an introductory course on, on business.  So I was thinking well maybe I would teach it at a local school on Thursday nights from six to nine [o'clock].  But sort of uninformed and so I, so the more I thought about it, the more the--it was clear that the films one way or the other, one way or the other dealing with business ethics.  I said well maybe I can put together a course using these films that introduce business ethics. That was a problem 'cause when I was in business school, we te- didn't teach business ethics. In fact one of my classmates from Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts], class of '79 [1979] Jeffrey Skilling was the CEO at Enron [Enron Corporation].  Ours- and is still in the federal penitentiary to this day. So just to give you an idea of where ethics training at Harvard when I was, when I was there.  So I spent some time asking myself if I were dean of a business school what would I expect to cover.  So I ended up, this being about half a year, so taking a deep dive and understanding what business ethics education was like, marrying the films to each of the topics that would be covered in an introductory business course.  And put together a, a syllabus and, but it was sort of a project on the side.  Once I had the syllabus I didn't know really quite what to do with it.  But I had a friend, who was at, on the faculty of Harvard Business School, and I said, "Just take a look at this, you know, are the paragraphs in the right order, does this make any sense?  I wanna get this polished up before I start talking to the schools here about doing it."  So he called me up and I think said one of the most flattering things that I've heard, he says, he says, "I got one question for you."  I said, "What's that?" He said, "Can I take the course?" (Laughter) I said, "No, it's not for you." He said, "Okay, here's what's going on.  One is we have a new dean at Harvard, you'll be glad to know we're actually teaching ethics, and it's a required first year course.  So why don't you come up here and, because you haven't done anything with it, why don't you just come up here and talk with us?"  I went up to the school, met with the ethics faculty. The course--they didn't wanna do the course, which fine.  But they wanted to integrate film into some of the, their ethics courses, and felt because I knew film and wanted to do this, asked if I would work to them to develop some film based courses on ethics, and I agreed to do it, and I could still keep my job with HBO and it was great.
Story_ID: 662943
Speaker 1: In the process of working with the faculty and developing these case studies and they brought me up to teach them, I fell in love with the idea of, of doing it full, full-time.  And so what started off as a sort of side project, became a real focus for me.  And so after I had developed the cases and had taught some, they approached me and asked if I would do this full-time.  They hate, right, they're in a mode right now where they hate giving part-time appointments.  Fortunately, and I was also turning sixty years old, it seemed time to, to make a change, I'd done well enough at HBO [Home Box Office] that I could you know take an 80 percent pay cut.  And so I decided that this, begin this new career in academia, it's been fantastic.  I've been able to work with I think some of the brightest minds in business.  Authored a number of--the focus has been largely on entertainment, and a number of cases on entertainment.  So a colleague and I wrote the first case on Shonda Rhimes and the growth, the growth of her, her company.  I've been to China to focus on the growth of that business; in fact I'm giving a lecture at the Harvard Club next week on what's happening in China.  So it's been a great career choice, and I love both bringing along the next set of students.  Being able to continue to do research and writing, and remain actively involved in the TV business.  Sit on the board of a large broadcast company called TEGNA [TEGNA Inc.]; it's actually the largest affiliate group for both CBS and NBC.  I'm doing consulting work for a company that's launched a subscription over, In- Internet delivery subscription service in the Gulf region.  And so right now I've got a great mix of both working in the business and in academia, so it's been great.
Speaker 2: When you broke the news to HBO how, how did that go?
Speaker 1: Everyone was so--they--everyone was so excited. One is because--and, and happy for me, and I guess because they knew my s- intellectual and academic interest.  But there was such universal joy and support and everyone said you know this really makes sense.  And I think what made a difference for them is that I wasn't going to a competitor. They knew of my deep, deep, deep attachments to, to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I've been very involved as an alum, I met my wife [Celia Betsky McGee] there, our daughter [Honor McGee] went there, our daughter met her husband [Jay Lundy, Jr.] there (laughter).  And so everyone was, was excited.
Story_ID: 662944
Speaker 1: When you look at your career, which is still--
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: --moving forward, so but you know what you have accomplished and what you hope to accomplish, what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I really want to be known as someone who made a, made a difference, in the, in the world, I think that's extremely important.  And I think that in my particular area, if I've helped, through the work I've done, the films I've supported, made people smarter, better educated or entertained them in some way, that's been very important to me.  But it's all about being driven by--and this comes right from my grandfather [Henry W. McGee, Sr.] on down--wanting to make sure that I made a difference in the world.
Story_ID: 662945
Speaker 1: For young people who might be interesting in getting into the cable business today, what advice would have for them?
Speaker 2: I would say that they should take a very, very deep dive into understanding the business.  They have to love it.  The parents aren't gonna love the, what I have to say, but they should watch as much television as they can.  They should watch as many movies as they can and just as someone wouldn't try to make a career as an editor at a book publishing house without having read and thought widely about different types of books, whether that's fiction, non-fiction.  Their success in the motion picture and television industry will be--can--will depend a lot on their ability to be conversant in and understand what's gone before them.
Story_ID: 662946
Speaker 1: As you look at your career, do you have any regrets?
Speaker 2: I don't have any regrets; I think the one thing that I would have liked to have done, while I grew the overseas business, I, I still regret that I never had a chance to live abroad for an extended period of, extended period of time.
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you would like to share that I have not asked you?
Speaker 2: I would say that the other aspect of my life which you haven't hit on is in addition to my work at a large corporation, working in the nonprofit, in the community world has been extremely important to me.  And I would say the most outside of HBO [Home Box Office], the most important thing for me was the twenty years or so that I spent at Alvin Ailey [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater].  Which I think is the premier African American arts organization, eventually being president of that board.  In fact speaking of global, I traveled around the world with Ailey to, my--took my very first trip to China with Ailey and Berlin [Germany] with, with Ailey.  And the friendship I was able to develop with [HistoryMaker] Judith Jamison who took over after, sadly, Mr. Ailey [Alvin Ailey] died, was--that's an extremely important relationship for me personally.  And I continue to be involved in the nonprofit world, so in Boston [Massachusetts] I'm on the Board of Overseers of the Museum of Fine Arts [Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Boston, Massachusetts].  I remain currently on the board of the Black Filmmaker Foundation and asked to spend some time on the board of Save the Children, which does important work around the, around the world to make it a safer, better place for children and, and their families.  So that's, I would say been very important, part, part of my life.
Speaker 1: Well you served on many, many, many not for profit boards--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --as well as corporate boards--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --all sort of at the same time as building HBO.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Thank you.

Speaker 2: And you were president what years?
Speaker 1: I was president from (pause) roughly--and we can look this--I know it's oral but roughly eighty--I would say '88 [1988] forward.
Speaker 2: Until?
Speaker 1: Until 2003.  Here I am in Uganda I'm with my wife Celia [Celia Betsky McGee] in the middle and our daughter Honor [Honor McGee].  To the right is Anne Mulcahy [Anne M.
