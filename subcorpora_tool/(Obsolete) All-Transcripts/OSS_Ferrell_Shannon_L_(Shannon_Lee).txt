 Gill. Today is September 21, 2009. I   m visiting with  Shannon Ferrell on the Oklahoma State University campus in Stillwater,  Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project of the  Oklahoma Oral History Program. Shannon, again, thank you for taking  time to interview with us today.  My pleasure.  And, of course, we   ll be talking about you personally but also about our  Scholar Development and Recognition Program. Who better to than one  of our former recipients? (Laughs)  As one of the products of that program.  Exactly. Well, Shannon, why don   t we back up a little bit. First of all,  could you tell me about your early life, about where you grew up, your  family, some of those things?  Absolutely. I was actually born in Stillwater to a couple of folks who, at  the time, were both OSU employees. My mom worked for the university  and was actually doing some student teaching at that time. My dad  worked for the Research Range out here. So, Cowboy born and bred, so  to speak. I actually lived in Stillwater the first couple years of my life,  and then we moved to our family farm in Leedey, where I really grew  up. Dad was a farmer-rancher; Mom helped him out. And then later on,  Mom became an OSU extension educator for Roger Mills County about  the time I was in the seventh grade. So, once again part of the OSU  family. Given that, heading to OSU was kind of always out there. I just  knew from   the first time I was truly cognizant of it, I think, was first  grade. I was like,    All right, got to go to college. Got to go to OSU.     (Laughter) It was really never another thought other than that, just go to  college, going to OSU. It was a no-brainer for me.  5  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  And your favorite mascot was Pistol Pete?  That   s right, that   s right. My principal joked that my senior year I spent  more time on campus up here than I did in high school, anyway, which  is probably about right.  I guess you lived on the farm. Were there some values you learned  growing up that helped shape you in later life?  Oh, absolutely. Probably the two foremost ones were to set goals, and  that   s something that not a lot of kids hear a lot is the importance of  setting goals for yourself. But from day one my parents worked really  hard to instill that in me. When I talk about wanting to go to OSU from  the time I was a first grader, that   s because my parents said,    Look,  college education is very important. You   ve got to start thinking about it  first thing out of the gate.    It wasn   t just that. They taught me to do that  in every area of my life, and that   s what got me so involved in  extracurricular activities, got me so involved in scholarships at the high  school level was setting that goal. Because as a farm kid, growing up in  the mid to late    80s, early    90s when farming wasn   t exactly making  money hand over fist in Oklahoma, Mom and Dad basically said,    Look,  if you want to go to college, you have to pay for it.    So, that   s another  goal you have to set for yourself is financially position yourself so that  you can do that. That   s a powerful motivator when you   re filling out  those scholarship applications.  The other thing (it sounds generic and it may even be trite, but it   s so  true) is just working hard. Nothing really comes easy out in the western  frontier, and that   s actually kind of a good thing for a kid to grow up in  because that taught you if something   s hard you keep chewing at it and  you keep working on it, and eventually you wear it down and you can do  it. But you   ve got to stick to it. The first time you get knocked down,  you   re not down for the count. You just get back up and come at it  again. I   d say those are the two biggest lessons that definitely got  instilled in me early on.  You lose your crop, you re-plant, huh?  Exactly, right.  What kind of farming and ranching operation did you all have?  We had basically a wheat and cattle operation. Most of it was   the cattle  was probably the biggest side, but we did lots of cultivation, too. And  I   ve got to admit, I was never much of a literal cowboy. I was definitely  an OSU Cowboy, but not much of a literal cowboy. I was more of the,  6  Gill  Ferrell  my dad called it, the    tractor jock.    I was an equipment pilot most of my  days, so I spent a lot of my formative years on orange tractors, big Allis-  Chalmers that the family owned. But, yes, wheat and cattle was  primarily what we did.  What were some of your high school experiences, activities that you  participated in?  Well, you know, I was talking to somebody about this just not very long  ago. The fact that Leedey High School, where I went, Leedey High  School was so small. It   s nothing uncommon for Oklahoma, but our  graduating class was twenty-two students. At that point in time when  that class was graduating in 1994, that was the largest class in Leedey  School. Everybody was smaller than twenty-two; most of them were in  the low to mid teens in class size. I joked with folks that we couldn   t  have cliques because if you were a clique you   d be the only member of  it. (Laughter) Everybody kind of had to do everything, and that actually  worked out really well for us because I really think that you had the  opportunity to be involved in more things because everybody was in  FFA and everybody was in 4-H and everybody had some involvement  with the sports teams. I didn   t play sports, but the guys still kept me  involved. I was the announcer, manager, all that sort of stuff.  I   d say probably the biggest thing that I was involved in in high school  and the things that probably shaped me the most was 4-H. Very active in  4-H, eventually went on to be a state officer, and to the extent that we  have national officers, I held a couple of those positions as well as a  National 4-H Ambassador and was a National 4-H Congress Committee  member. 4-H is one of those things that whenever you   re interviewing  for a scholarship or an award on campus, and after the interview the  judges talk to you, they always say,    Were you involved in 4-H, or were  you involved in FFA?    Because they could always tell that those kids  that have had that experience and being up in front of people, it really  shown through.  That was a big chunk of it, but I think that the bigger part about 4-H for  me was I got a lot of my belief in self from being involved in 4-H, and  some people wonder what I mean by that. Well, I was not a very  confident kid until I became really involved in 4-H. I was like,    I   m a  nerd. What do I really have to offer anybody? I   ll just stay over here and  read, and I   ll be fine with that.    But 4-H is a wonderful organization  because it gets youth involved not only in learning themselves, but it  involves them in teaching younger children. I really started to gain some  value from that and said,    Wow, I really have something I can offer  somebody else.    They gave me a lot of confidence, and without that  confidence I know I would not have done what I did when I was here at  7  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  OSU.  The other two things that I was involved in a lot were speech and  Academic Bowl which, again, just gave me the opportunity to kind of  mix it up with kids from other schools, get to know them, expand my  horizons a little bit. It was one of those rare high school atmospheres  where it was okay and, in fact, even admired to be smart. It was okay to  be bookish. It actually served you pretty well, and that helped me out a  lot, too. (Laughs)  Shannon, in addition to the farm and ranching, did your parents work  outside the farm?  Yes, like I said, my mother worked for OSU Cooperative Extension,  which was another great way of plugging me into a lot of opportunities  and getting me connected with the university. My dad was a farmer   s co-op  manager at a couple of the towns nearby where we lived. I learned a  lot through that as well, getting to be the cheap help whenever he was  short-handed. Of course, when you   re the kid of the boss, none of the  labor laws apply to you, so they can tell you to do whatever. (Laughter)  But that was fun, too, and that was a good way to get mixed up with  some folks from other towns, as well, kind of expand those horizons.  What were your early impressions of Oklahoma State? I   m sure you   d  been on campus a lot, but as a student when you first came here as a  freshman.  I think I was kind of surprised by how much OSU was like a small town.  A big chunk of that was the fact that so many of us at OSU come from  small towns, and we carry those values with us. But even folks that were  from Tulsa, Oklahoma City or the big out-of-state towns all seemed to  fit into part of this OSU culture. It   s so welcoming and so embracing.  Just last week I had the opportunity to interview some of the candidates  that were up for Homecoming Royalty. It was amazing to me that even  all these years after I   d graduated, almost to a person it was uncanny  how similar their answers were when we asked them what was one of  their favorite things about OSU. They all said how welcoming of a place  it was.  The other thing that I really enjoyed about OSU was that there was  something for anybody. Like I said, when you   re from a small town,  everybody does everything, and those folks are your friends because  that   s who you   ve got. At OSU when you come here from a small town,  for the first time in your life perhaps, you have the opportunity to seek  out your own crowd and to kind of build that yourself. I was so amazed  by the fact that there were actually other people out there that thought  8  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  like me and were interested in the same things I did. And no matter what  the interest was, I could find somebody to kind of be a partner in crime  there. Those are the two things that really stood out to me when I first  showed up.  Your major was ag econ from the get-go?  That   s right.  Why ag econ?  (Laughs) Well, there   s a couple of reasons, I suppose. The more noble  reason was I kind of felt a draw to the business side of agriculture and  entertained ideas of maybe going into law or policy, maybe elected  office, and thought that the tools I would need to understand those  decisions would come from ag econ. That   s the noble reason. The reason  I   m probably not as proud of   this is kind of mimicry. When I first  came here as a freshman, I really thought I wanted to go into politics.  Our congressional representative at that point in time, still is today,  Frank Lucas was an ag econ major. So, I thought,    Well, if I want to be  like Frank, I should be an ag econ major.     From western Oklahoma?  From western Oklahoma. So, it was just following Frank   s footsteps.  Well, obviously, as you were talking about having a plan, your parents  taught you, you were a very focused student. Did you have an academic  plan here at Oklahoma State when you came here as a freshman? I  mean, specific ideas about where you wanted to go as an undergraduate,  what you wanted to do?  I knew of some of those scholarships out there, those big scholarships.  The one I   d actually heard of from one of Mom   s co-workers was the  Truman Scholarship. And in the story I   m sure Bob Graalman will be  happy to regale you with at some point in time is a freshman from  Leedey, Oklahoma who sets up an appointment the first few weeks he   s  on campus, marches into the office and says,    Dr. Graalman, I   m  Shannon Ferrell. I want to be a Truman scholar and a Rhodes scholar.  Tell me what I   m supposed to do.    (Laughter) So, come in there, guns  blazing, thinking I   m just going to take this stuff down. I think I knew it  may have been more work than I thought I had in my mind, but still I  thought,    I   ll just go in here, and we   ll get this lined out.    I did want to  do those things, and as you know I succeeded with the Truman, did not  succeed at the Rhodes. But in retrospect, I think I was more of a Truman  guy than a Rhodes guy, anyway. And Dr. Graalman was great about  9  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  guiding me through those goals. I was so grateful that there was  somewhere to go, kind of that one-stop shop to say,    Hey, if someone  has this kind of aspiration, what kind of plan do they need to put in  place?    Because I knew the goal was out there to be a scholar, and I  knew people from OSU had done it, but I didn   t know the pathway to  get from where I was to where I wanted to be.  And preparation that would be necessary for that.  Exactly.  Well, speaking of that, were there some professors, administrators early  on that influenced you and helped direct and guide you? Not necessarily  from the Scholars Program, just from the university.  Absolutely. Other than Dr. Graalman, which that goes without saying,  but I was extraordinarily blessed to have an absolutely outstanding  advisor in Dr. Joe Williams. Dr. Williams has enough Advisor Of The  Year plaques you could build a small house out of just the plaques. But  it was so coincidental. The way that I got affiliated with Dr. Williams  was that his daughters were very active in 4-H and they were the same  age, and I hung out with them a lot. So, whenever I was coming to  campus for a 4-H event, they   d invite me.    Hey, why don   t you stay at  our house while you   re in Stillwater,    and that   s how I got to meet Dr.  Williams. So, as soon as he found out I was enrolling, he was like,     You   re mine. I don   t care what day it is, you   re my advisee.    He took  such fantastic care of me. I could probably tell you a lot of stories. I will  tell you this one.  Go right ahead.  Dr. Williams   and I look at this story as different examples, depending  on your perspective of it, but I was filling out the Truman application.  Again, I   d been working on the Truman application for years, getting  myself prepared. What I had not realized was the deadline for the  recommendation letters. Dr. Williams was one of my recommendation  letters but I didn   t realize how quickly I needed them. So, the deadline  was looming large. I had to find Dr. Williams. He was on vacation. He  was elk hunting in the mountains. I don   t know how we managed to get  a hold of him, but we got a hold of Dr. Williams, who rode his pack  mule down the mountain to the nearest town, found where he could get  to a typewriter and a fax machine and made that recommendation letter  out, and shot it back to me so it would make it into the packet in time.  Now, he would tell you that story as an example of    you need to get  those undergrads lined out and help them have some sense of deadline.     But I use that story as an example of just exactly how devoted Dr.  10  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Williams was to his students. It did not matter what. If it needed done  for his students, he would get it done. So, that   s one person.  Another person would be Dr. Wes Holley. Dr. Holley was, at the time I  believe, the Assistant Dean for Academics in the College of Agriculture,  as such was responsible for the freshman orientation program, but I  think kind of unofficially served as the leader for groups like Ag Council  and lots of the student leadership roles. I got to know Dr. Holley really  well. He was a tremendous mentor to me in a relationship that kind of  transcended academic departments. He was just an outstanding mentor  and really guided me along in my process and constantly encouraged  me, supported me, and helped me keep a level head about things, too.  And so between Dr. Williams and Dr. Holley, I was extraordinarily  blessed to have two mentors like that in my academic career.  In addition to the academic things we   re talking about, were you  involved in student leadership activities and organizations? Could you  share a little bit of the non-scholar participation in things?  Sure. Probably one of my favorites was being a member of the ag  student council. I was, again, blessed enough that as a freshman I got to  join the group as one of their freshman representatives on the council.  And so, again, got to be involved with some extraordinary leaders at the  college level. For example, Sean Copeland, a very prominent alumni, a  great business leader now, but was a tremendous leader here as a student  as well. Really enjoyed getting to work with him. I loved ag council so  much because it wasn   t departmental. By all means I loved my  department, but I loved getting to interact with everybody. That was a  great place for plant and soil scientists, ag engineers, ag economists, and  everybody, animal scientists, all worked together. I   m one of those guys  that just loves to learn. Again, that may be a nerdish trait, but I guess it   s  good for a scholar to have, I suppose. But I just loved to learn about  what everybody else was up to. That was a great opportunity. We talked  earlier about that sense of community, and I think in the College of Ag  that was exemplified so well in ag student council because all these kids  from all these backgrounds came together, and it was almost like having  a barn raising every week when we met. (Laughter) Everyone got  together and did great things because of the work ethic and the vision  that they each individually had.  Shannon, you talked about going up and visiting with Bob Graalman,  head of the Scholar Development Recognition Program, early on. How  did you become involved and engaged in the Scholar Development  Program?  Well, during that initial meeting that I had with Dr. Graalman, he kind of  11  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  laid out if you want to be a Truman scholar, these are the characteristics  that that panel looks for, and if you have those, let   s look and see how  we can cultivate that and make you a richer candidate. If you wanted to  go for the Rhodes, this is the kind of candidate they look for, how we  can cultivate those traits as well. So, we kind of laid out a plan there.  But the other thing that really helped me out a lot was Dr. Graalman   s  Windows to the World class, which I believe he still teaches, which was  an honors class. It was designed to help students start to play around  with the type of discussion that they would have if they were a candidate  being interviewed for one of the national prestige scholarships. The way  that Dr. Graalman handled the class was we would pick an issue each  week. We   d have some reading, and we would have a class discussion  about that. It was good for a valedictorian from Leedey to be in that  class because I might have been a valedictorian from Leedey, but there  were some other people out there with much more intellectual  horsepower than I had. I learned in that class in a very respectful way  and a very nurturing way that there   s some competition out there and  you   ve got to improve. It   s not good enough to be at the level you are  now. You   ve got to become more eloquent. You have to become better  read. You have to expand the breadth of your interests. I recognized  there were a lot of smart people out there going after the same stuff. But  that was a wonderful environment to be in, and that class, I think, really  accelerated my preparation for those activities.  You talked about meeting with Bob and kind of developing a plan. What  were the parts of that plan, Shannon? What are specifically some things  that you needed to do to cultivate and develop yourself?  Well, one of the things that they do a great job of is helping you identify  what your passions and your strengths are, because that   s kind of the  core of the candidate that you   re going to be. I tell the story about trying  out for the Rhodes and being,    Well, I didn   t get it. It wasn   t a  successful    trip.       But in retrospect, that   s because I think I wasn   t really  a Rhodes kind of candidate, and I was trying to make myself be  somebody that I just wasn   t. I wasn   t that guy.  Would you describe that as more a liberal arts kind of person?  Exactly. Yes. I was more of a technical, kind of pragmatic kind of  scholar. So, the Truman was a great fit for me because with the Truman  you   re focusing on a policy issue, coming up with a practical,  implementable solution for that. That worked for me; that was a fit. So,  one of the things that the Scholar Development Program helped me do is  realize who I am and how to enrich that person, so to speak, how to kind  of expand around that core. That included things as simple as identifying  12  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  good classes to take, expanding out what your degree sheet says, use  those electives wisely, so to speak. But that also includes just having the  opportunity to interact with folks of that kind of high caliber of  individual. Being part of the Scholar Development Program gave me the  opportunity to go to functions where I would meet with past successful  candidates and leaders on campus and off campus. Being in that  environment, interacting with those folks kind of brings life to that  proverb,    Iron sharpens iron. One man sharpens another.    And putting  yourself in those environments and forcing yourself to interact in a cadre  of folks that you may not be accustomed to really helped me hone my  interview skills, my discussion skills, and I realized that I needed to have  a breadth of knowledge to speak intelligently about whatever the  important issues were at the time.  Shannon, part of a question you alluded to earlier about identifying who  you were and then a plan and doing some research and policy. Were you  part of the Freshman Research Program?  I was.  And the Wentz, could you speak to those two programs?  Oh, absolutely. Yes, I was very blessed to have a Freshman Research  Scholarship and was able to kind of leapfrog from that into three Wentz  projects. So, I was very, very blessed that every year I was here, I had  some sort of undergraduate research project. Most of those centered  around rural economic development, which was one of my passions.  That was so perfect for my Truman application because that, again, gave  me that depth of knowledge about an issue that not a lot of folks knew  about and fed perfectly into my policy statement, which wound up being  about business incubators as a tool for developing small businesses in  rural Oklahoma. Having that undergraduate research experience was just  invaluable from a number of perspectives. First off, it   s something that  hardly, at that point in time, hardly any undergraduates did. So, it was a  true stand-out item on your application if you could show that you had  research experience there, which, as a matter of fact, it even enabled me  to have some published work and to do a presentation at a professional  conference. How many undergraduates get to do that?  The other thing about it was it showed you had the ability to articulate a  project, apply for a grant, you receive it, administer it. Again, it showed  a lot of leadership in a unique role where many undergraduates didn   t  have the opportunity for that kind of academic leadership. So, I think  OSU probably owes a larger debt than we realize to the folks that  sponsor the Freshman Research Scholars and the Wentz Scholarships  because that gives our students just fantastic and unique opportunities.  13  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  I   m hearing you describe parts of the preparation components, if you  will, of the Scholar Recognition Program, but it   s a little different for  each candidate, isn   t it? It   s a combination of some of the outside class  works and electives you take, meeting with Bob Graalman, participating  in some of the special Windows to the World program that he has, its  research programs. Are there some things I   m missing about different  components of that program?  I think you   ve got them all, and I think if you look at that as a whole,  then the unspoken thing there is finding your passion and then  expressing it. Because it   s easy for candidates to talk a good game when  they   re in their interview and show that they know a lot about this policy  issue or that policy issue, but that   s easy to see through. What I think  we   ve been so successful at here at Oklahoma State University is  identifying students that really have a genuine passion for something.  With me, it was all my work in rural economic development. Another  excellent recent example would be Courtney Timmons in the  Biosystems Department. Courtney was one of the people that organized  Real Cowboys Recycle. It   d be easy for an ag engineer or environmental  engineer to talk about the importance of recycling and sustainability,  but, you see, folks at OSU don   t just talk about policy. They go out and  start wildly successful recycling programs. They   ve actually done  something about it, and that   s because, I think, again, they   ve identified  that passion in themselves.    This is something that I genuinely have a  concern for,    and then they actually go out and do something about it.  That   s great. I appreciate that explanation, Shannon. Specifically  preparing for your Truman and maybe focusing on your competition for  the Truman scholarship, what are some specific things you did to  prepare yourself for that competition?  Speaking about the application and the competition itself, we   ll kind of  divorce ourselves from the career preparation, but when it comes down  to the nuts and bolts, you fill out an application packet, you go to an  interview. So, how do you prepare for that? Again, OSU does such a  tremendous job of having lots of folks that were willing to look at my  application materials, make lots of constructive comments. Lots of red  pens died at the hands of my applications for all the people that marked  them up, (Laughter) but it made it so much better.  The other tremendously valuable thing that we did (and this is something  that was really an asset) was, because we   d had some success at those  programs in the past, we had some faculty members who had the benefit  of working with those past candidates, some of them that had been  interviewers at some of those selection panels. So, we had a wonderfully  rigorous, if you can use that word, wonderfully rigorous mock interview  14  Gill  Ferrell  program where two or three times, at each stage of the process as a  candidate advanced, they would put together these mock interview  panels and give you the real-world combat environment where they were  lobbing the high fast ones at you. You were getting the chin music when  you were up at the plate, but that was tremendously valuable for me  because I   d never been in an interview environment like that. I   d  interviewed for scholarships and interviewed for campus positions, but  never in an environment like the national scholarships put you in.  Having that experience took so much of the fear out of the process  because you knew you weren   t jumping into the unknown when you had  the real interview. So, the application reviews at all levels, at the college,  the university level, the mock interviews, were probably the biggest  pieces of the training program as you went to the selection process itself.  Could you explain that application process, the types of questions they  would ask on the application itself, what they   d want you to say about  yourself?  Certainly. Of course, you have kind of the usual CV information, where  have you been, what have you done, but with the Truman at that point in  time, you had a series of essay questions with fairly narrow limits (you  couldn   t go on forever) about specific examples of leadership that you  had performed, specific aspirations you had for service, your plans for  graduate study, a very detailed plan of study for your graduate programs  as part of the Truman application. The last, the perhaps most important  piece is your policy statement wherein you pick a policy issue and you  pick a specific individual to whom it is going to be addressed. It needs to  be a name, it needs to be a position, it needs to be a specific agency. So,  basically, it   s like you   re preparing a policy recommendation for a real  person and handing it to them. In your policy statement you outline a  solution that needs to be implementable. It can   t be a pie in the sky,    If  we had unlimited resources this is what we   ll do.    It needs to be a very  realistic, implementable solution to some real problem.  With my application we were in the midst of a new farm bill. At that  point in time, there was a lot of debate about payments to farmers in the  form of commodity payments, which isn   t really news. Every time we  have a farm bill it   s the same debate every time, but I thought,    Aha,  I   ve got something. I   m going to derail this debate,    because there was  talk about eliminating a few commodity programs. And I said,    Okay,  with the money that we   re going to save from those commodity  programs, let   s take those funds and invest them in establishing these  rural business incubators to provide some diversity to the rural economy  and use the incubators to help businesses when they   re in their most  vulnerable phase.    When most businesses fail is there in those startup  stages. That was the way we could show it was implementable was by  15  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  taking a kind of zero-sum game and deducting some federal expenses  here and creating them there. That   s probably the most challenging part  for lots of candidates is,    Okay, how do you pay for it?    So, that   s how  the Truman application kind of flows.  And that   s one of the areas where, in addition to your background of  learning to write, that   s where review by mentors and faculty members  help you with your application process.  Absolutely.  In addition to helping you in the mock interviews.  Absolutely. As a matter of fact, it worked out tremendously because that  was actually the topic of my Wentz Research Project that year. I   d been  studying business incubators here in the state of Oklahoma, and so it fed  right into that. I had the benefit of having Dr. Woods here in the  Department of Ag Econ who was a rural development specialist. He was  my mentor in the research project and then helped me provide a review  of the policy: Was it something that was feasible? Were we using the  right language? Is this something that would speak to folks?  What a synergy there between the students and the faculty. Wonderful,  isn   t it?  It   s tremendous, absolutely tremendous. Cannot say enough about it.  So, the interview. The application and just one interview?  One interview.  Where did you interview? Can you tell me a little bit about the  interview?  The interview was held in Dallas, Texas, at the Federal Reserve branch  down there. So that there   s no opportunity for the questions that the  committee   s asking to leak out, you   re sequestered for the whole day.  You go to the interview, you report in at a specific time and you   re in a  room with your fellow candidates for the whole day. So, you kind of  hope you   re one of those first interviews so you can breathe the air of  sweet freedom again. While I was sitting in the interview room, I  remember thinking,    I love OSU. I love what they   ve done for me. I   m a  pretty good candidate, but I   m going to get destroyed. These guys are  phenomenal.    Everyone   s there, and they   re talking and they   re making  chit chat. No one   s being boastful or trying to intimidate anybody. It was  a wonderfully genial group, but in just talking about their experiences I  16  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  thought,    My gosh, this guy   s done study abroad in this country. This  guy   s done these community service projects. I   m going to get creamed  here, kids. It   s not even going to be close.    But I kind of shoved all that  aside. I said,    You know what, I   ve got a reason to be here. They  selected me, so they must think I   d at least be entertaining to talk to if  nothing else.    I went in there and did my best. I think we do a good job  of training because I think they had me to the point where I thought it  was just going to be all-out bloody combat from the first time I stepped  in there, and the interview panel was actually very genial. It was an  enjoyable conversation.  And how many were on the panel?  I want to say   I can   t recall if it was five or seven. It was a decently  large panel. (Laughs) I got frustrated at a couple of my answers. I  remember they asked,    If you could go anywhere to vacation, where  would you go?    In speaking honestly, I said,    I   d like to go to D.C.  because I love the government system, and I love to learn about it. I   d  love to be there.    Well, they thought that was too much of a Truman  interview answer. So, they said,    All right, forget that. Where would you  go internationally?    I said,    I   d like to go to Rome.       Why Rome?    I  was like,    That   s obviously the seat of the Roman government where we  got a lot of the structure of our democratic system there.    They   re like,     No, that   s a Truman answer again. Where would you go?    (Laughter)  I   m like,    Chicago. It   s a really fun town. I went there at 4-H Congress.  Go to Michael Jordan   s restaurant. I don   t know. Hang out at the  Adler   Planetarium, get some Chicago pizza, I guess.    That was it. And then of  course, Dr. Graalman will tell you this story, but then there   s the  infamous envelope of dirt. Has Bob ever told you that story?  No, I haven   t heard it.  I   ll rat myself out. Bob tells this every time we   re in the same room, and  I suppose it deserves retold. But I thought I needed some sort of hook.  You   re going to interview approximately fifteen to twenty amazingly  qualified candidates over the course of the day. How are you going to  remember this kind of generic looking kid from Oklahoma who   s got a  really strong ag background? Well, the week before I left the farm as a  freshman, I took an old mason jar and I went out to the field. It was my  field. Dad had given me a field that was mine to cultivate. I got the  revenues from it and everything else. I went out to my field and I  scooped up a jar of dirt so I   d always have a little bit of home with me. I  thought,    Well, you know what? This is going to be,    Local kid done  good    if I can pull this off.    I took a little bit of the dirt from that jar, and  I put it in a little envelope and I took it with me to the interview. I get to  the end of the interview, and it   s like,    Is there anything that you   d like  17  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  for us to know, Mr. Ferrell, that you haven   t already told us about?    I  thought for a second, and I pulled out this envelope of dirt that I   d  brought from home. It   s dirt; it   s red Oklahoma clay dirt. (Laughter)  And I tell them the story of where this dirt came from, and I said,    You  know what? This dirt kind of represents me. You know, this is my tie to  rural Oklahoma. I want to make a difference for those folks, and that   s  why I carried this with me, to show my connection to the people that  farmed this land the same as I did.    I   m hoping it was either the merits  of my other answers or maybe that was the hook. I don   t know, but I got  the scholarship. So, to this day, Bob Graalman cannot believe that I did  that. I   m sure he shrinks in embarrassment every time he hears it, but  that   s what I did.  Did you find out that same day, Shannon, at the end of the day? How did  you get notification?  How did we find out? There   s a funny story in itself. I found out because  I was sitting in my farm appraisal class here in the Ag Econ Department  and at the time. President Halligan comes in followed by Dr. Graalman  and some folks with some balloons. I thought,    This is really odd. What  is going on?    President Halligan goes up to Dr. Kletke, the instructor,  and says,    Dr. Kletke, we are so sorry to interrupt your class but can we  borrow your class for just a second?    And Dr. Halligan says,    We   ve  just received word that one of your students was a successful candidate  for the Truman Scholarship, and it was Shannon Ferrell.    Oh, that was     oh, I shrank. I was terribly ecstatic but, you know, embarrassed at the  same time. But it was wonderful. It was one of the stand-out moments in  my college career and I   ll never forget it. But I have to say   here   s the  funny thing. That day I was interviewing for an internship with the  Noble Foundation. The interviewers asked if I   d like to go to lunch with  them. I said,    Well, guys, I would love to, but I have to turn in an  assignment in my farm appraisal class, otherwise I   d go with you.    And  if that homework assignment had not been due that day, I would have  missed class because I would   ve been going to lunch with those guys.  That   s what everybody says:    When a potential employer asks you if  you want to go out, go out with them.    So, I would   ve missed that class,  and Dr. Halligan and Dr. Graalman would   ve went to a classroom  without a Shannon Ferrell in it, (Laughs) because their Truman Scholar  would have skipped class that day if it hadn   t been for that assignment.  Great story. Well, Shannon, how has your selection as a Truman  Scholar impacted your life initially and now?  I would almost say that the initial impact has actually been the same as it  is today, and that is that the scholarship money is great. There   s no  bones about that. But I would almost   well, I would not almost, I would  18  Gill  Ferrell  place that second to just the fact that it opened so many doors. Being a  Truman Scholar   understandably the university kind of wants to  showcase, say,    Hey, this is a Truman Scholar.    That gave me so many  opportunities to visit with people like regents, the large supporters of the  university, the administration, opportunities I would not have had had it  not been for that. Again, it reinforced to me that,    Wow, if I can hang  out with this cadre of individual maybe I can make a difference.    And,  again, it gave me that confidence to try things and do things that I  wouldn   t have otherwise. I think that   s still true to this day. I really  appreciate it now because it gives me the opportunity to work with the  candidates of today. I don   t know that I   d have the opportunity to work  with so many of those fantastic students if it wasn   t for the fact that I,  myself, was a scholar. I still appreciate the fact of having that honor  really provides a lot of opportunities.  Aside from your selection as a Truman Scholar, how did your  participation in the Scholar Program impact you personally and help  you develop as a student and as a person? I mean, if you hadn   t won the  Truman Scholarship, how would it have impacted you?  I was actually telling some students that were identifying themselves as  wanting to participate in the Scholar Development program   I was  telling this a couple weeks ago. We were talking just a few minutes ago  about the interview day. Being in that room, sequestered with those  folks, talking to them, and I remembered as I was driving home that day,  I thought to myself,    You know what, Ferrell? Even if you don   t win  this scholarship, it   s been worth it.    Because it forced me to have a  richer experience at OSU than I would have had if I   d just been going  through trying to get a bachelor   s degree. It made me do exciting things.  It made me really push myself and see what I was capable of. I was so  grateful to have the opportunity to work with the folks that helped me.  Working with the Bob Graalmans, the Joe Williams, the Wes Holleys of  the world. I would   ve had so much richer a life if it had just been that.  That   s all it   s really taken in, and the opportunity to meet my fellow  candidates for the Truman interview, which some of them I still keep up  with today. We still talk about the day we all interviewed for the Truman  there. I think that   s a big part of it.  It also taught me to be more open-minded. I say that because in the  process of going through the Scholar Development Program, you   re  hanging out with a lot of your fellow students that are very articulate,  very thoughtful, very well-read, but many of whom may have a different  perspective on a lot of issues than you. As part of the discussions that  you have in your preparations and your Windows to the World class,  etc., you get to see that you can be open to well-reasoned arguments  from others and be embracing of that and have a civil, open dialogue and  19  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  really talk about issues and not just have to be locked into your  provincial view of the world to the effect of tuning out everybody else as  well. I needed that because I came from a small town where everybody  kind of has the same values, and there   s nothing wrong with that at all.  Nothing wrong with that at all, but you weren   t often confronted with  different points of view and sometimes you need that.  Shannon, help me understand. When you receive the Truman  Scholarship, do you get to pick where you want to do your graduate  education?  Exactly.  And you picked     I actually finished up my master   s degree at OSU, but fortunately was  able to continue on some scholarships that I already had there, and then  the rest of my award went with me to law school at Oklahoma City  University.  Thank you, and we   ll get to that here in just a second. But I wanted to  ask you real quick, can you think of some names of other individuals that  participated with you here at OSU in the Scholars Program when you  were a student?  Well, the biggest name that pops into my head is Chris Stephens. Of  course, Chris was successful in his pursuit of the Truman, and then  Blaine Greteman. Chris and Blaine and I were all in the same class.  Wow.  As our career went on, our academic years spread apart a little bit so that  Blaine and I won our awards one year and then Chris the succeeding  year. But there were lots of other great students in there as well. Those  were some of the stand-out names.  About how many students in a given year would actually seriously  develop themselves for a competition for a prestigious scholarship?  I   d say probably around twenty or so, I mean, give or take a little bit. It   s  not a huge number, and one of the challenges we have is convincing  students not so much to go for it, but to convince them that they could  do it. You know, say,    Hey, you   ve got the talent. You   ve got the  potential. Let us help you cultivate that.     I   ve had a chance to do some interviews now and have picked up that in  20  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  some instances, not a lot but in some instances, people have indicated  that perhaps we shouldn   t be utilizing so many resources in scholarship  dollars and time and focus on such a small number of students. How  would you answer that?  I   ve been presented the same question as well. Again, you are spending  lots of resources on a relatively small number of students, but I think     and I don   t know if this is the negative or the positive argument, but it  seems like it would be a shame to have students of that level of talent  here at Oklahoma State University and not do everything you could to  accelerate them as much as you could. Because those students obviously  benefit themselves, but the benefits bestowed upon those students  radiate out to the students that they   re around as well. I know so many of  them reach out to help their fellow students succeed in their classes or  their organizations. We have some secondary benefits from that as well  because I think by having some outstanding examples of students that  have done so well in that program, we could hold those students forward  as an example that really, I think, encourages other supporters to donate  perhaps to Scholar Development, perhaps to other scholars programs  across the university or to scholarship programs themselves because they  say,    What if my scholarship dollars could help a student like that?     Then, I can point to that student and say,    Hey, I helped someone reach  that level of achievement there.     Good point. Are there other student awards and recognitions that you  received at Oklahoma State University aside from your Truman  scholarship? You   ve mentioned a couple.  Yes, we talked about the Wentz and the Freshman Research. I would say  probably, other than those, the one that probably I was proudest of was  my recognitions as a Top Ten Freshman and Top Ten Senior. It was a  tremendous honor, but I think what made it more of an honor other than  just the fact that you were a Top Ten was the people that had received  that award. I mean, the people that I had known that were Top Ten  Freshmen and Top Ten Seniors were people that I held in the absolute  highest esteem. It was an honor to be considered just like them, so to  speak. The other one that was also tremendously important to me and I  was equally proud of was being the Outstanding Senior in the College of  Agriculture. Again, because there had been so many outstanding people  before me that had received that honor, I felt kind of humbled to be put  into that company.  Shannon, what about your social life, activities on campus? I mean,  anything you could tell on record?  Social life. (Laughter) It   s funny to talk about social life. I was actually  21  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  talking with somebody yesterday about this and the fact that our social  life equaled our campus life.  Yes, like,    What life?     Exactly. (Laughter) I wouldn   t trade it for anything, though, because  that   s how I had my fun was my clubs. And people say,    Okay, you   re  not applying for a scholarship now. You can be honest with us.    But it  really is true. That   s where I had so much fun. All my friends from OSU  that I still keep up with today are the people that I met through those  clubs. It was the opportunity to meet people and interact and share  friendships while you were still doing something good for the college  and for the university. I embraced that so whole-heartedly because when  I was a kid I got really frustrated when I   d hang out with my dad  because we could never get anywhere fast. He would always find  somebody he knew and he   d always have to talk to them. We   d never  make it anywhere because he   d start talking to somebody, and he   d get a  little closer to the car. Then he   d talk to them kind of in the door of the  car. Then, he   d be in the car with the window rolled down, still talking  to them. And as a little kid, you   re saying,    Dad, can we go home? You  know, it   s been forty-five minutes.     But he told such a wonderful story about the friends that he   d made at  OSU, I couldn   t wait to have those friends. It   s kind of funny, but I think  it   s true. I think both my dad and myself   and I think you could even  say if there are multiple generations of Cowboys in a family, the friends  that you make here, it   s as though it   s the same play but different people  are playing the parts. Like everyone has this kind of friend, and for Dad  it was this guy, and for me it was this guy, and for my kids it   ll be some  other guy. But it   s so wonderful to see that you   ve got that kind of  continuity all through the generations. And, so, that was my social life at  OSU, was all my organizational work.  Well, kind of shifting gears here, could you give some highlights of your  graduate education here at Oklahoma State, and then we   ll get into a  little bit of your legal career?  I can blame me being a professor on a couple of things pretty first-and-foremost.  Number one was my advisor, Joe Williams. I thought,    Wow,  if I can have the kind of impact on students that he had, that would be  something that would be a life well spent.    The other thing that Joe  Williams did to/for me was when I was his graduate student I did some  teaching assistant work. I taught a lab section of his farm and ranch  class. Now, prior to that point, I had done presentations in 4-H, and I   d  done public speaking, and that was fun. But that was my first time to  really teach. I really, really had a blast teaching. I mean, I really had fun  22  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  with it, more so than I thought I would. I was surprised by that, and I  think that   s what kind of sealed my eventual academic fate, was the fun  that I had as a teaching assistant for Dr. Williams in my graduate  program.  My graduate work was centered around environmental regulation of  large farming operations. Specifically we were talking about large swine  operations, which at that point in time were really starting to be  prominent in the state, and it was getting to be kind of a topic of public  debate, were the environmental impacts of these farms. I did not know  that doing a master   s thesis on the economic impacts of increased  environmental regulations to these farms was going to eventually dictate  my legal career, which when we talk about law school we can talk about  that. But that would come back to haunt me in my legal career. (Laughs)  Taking your words about teaching and finding something you have  passion for and doing it, as you said earlier?  Yes, and that really clicked.  So, you then went to Oklahoma City University, OCU Law School.  Right.  And, let   s see. Let me get some dates. You graduated, got your first  degree, your bachelor   s degree in     Ninety-eight, and then my master   s   I   m sorry, in 2000. And then went  on to law school 2000 to 2003.  Did you have in mind, Shannon, when you went to law school you  wanted that background in policy and a legal background, but did you  assume you wanted to get back into teaching at some point then?  My thought was,    Someday I would really like to do that,    and famous  last words. I told myself I   d like to go out into the private sector, get  some really good experience, kind of make my fortune. Then, you know,  once that fortune   s made, hopefully by that point in time this ag law  position that I currently have, I thought ten to fifteen years down the  road, that   ll probably be opening up and that   d be a good time for me to  slide back in. Things move along a little quicker than that, but that   s  perfectly okay, and I   ve loved it anyway.  So, when you graduated, and I think you graduated fifth in your class of  167, something like that?  23  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Yes.  Congratulations.  Thank you, thank you. (Laughs)  Then you, for four years, you were in law practice at a couple different  firms specializing in     Environmental law, and so here   s where the pigs come back to bite me,  so to speak. I was interviewing with a large firm in Oklahoma City. It  was a large general practice firm, had many individualized departments.  They interviewed me and said,    Well, Shannon, what area would you  like to go in?    My thought had always been corporate transactional law  because my ag business background and I was kind of intrigued by  making the deal, so to speak. And I said,    Well, you know, I   ve kind of  thought about corporate law.    They asked,    Would you consider  environmental law?    And I   m not paraphrasing too much when I said,     You guys sign the paychecks, so if you want me to do environmental  law, I   ll happily do environmental law.    The reason they gave was they  said,    We notice you   ve got this background in agricultural sciences,  and your thesis was on an environmental topic. We need somebody in  our environmental group and we think you   d be a good fit.    I said,     Well, hey, sure, I   d be happy to give it a try.     I got into it, and I was surprised at how much I really enjoyed  environmental law. I   d always loved the sciences, and early on in life I  kind of thought about being an engineer, but calculus kicked my rear,  (Laughter) so engineering was probably out. It gave me a great  opportunity to apply that love of science and couple it with agriculture  and the things I learned there. I really enjoyed environmental law. It was  really a fit for me. Never would have thought it until that point.  So, is there a story about how you got back to Oklahoma State, then,  before you got your     Before I got my fortune? (Laughter) Well, really it was kind of odd. The  person that held the position prior to me retired well before my   I don   t  know what I was basing my projections on when she would retire, but I  was off. She retired early, so they were kind of caught in a lurch. There  was no one to teach the agricultural law class, which is one of the  degree-sheet courses for a lot of the ag majors, and they said,    We really  need somebody to teach this class, or a lot of students are going to fall  off the end of the table.    I joined kind of as a visiting lecturer just to  teach the class. After I taught it for the first semester, I was just hooked  again. I had that love I had for teaching reignited, and I thought,    Man,  24  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  if this full-time position opens up, I   d be stupid not to apply for it.     I loved my job in private practice, but I absolutely loved teaching. I  thought,    If it opens up, I   ll do it.    I had to run that by my lovely bride.  We   d just been married at that point. It took a little courage to summon  up the nerve to ask your wife that you   ve just married,    Would you mind  taking a fantastic pay cut if it meant seeing me around Stillwater more  often?    And bless her heart, my wife, who   s got a passion that is equal  to my own for OSU and is a third generation OSU grad, she supported  me wholeheartedly because she wanted me to be happy, and that   s one  of the things I truly adore most about her. So, she said yes, and I went  through the application process, and here I am. (Laughs)  Great story. So, what year, then, did you start teaching full-time at  Oklahoma State?  I started teaching full-time in 2007.  So, you taught for, what, a year or two on a part-time basis?  Yes.  Can you share a little bit of information about your teaching and  extension responsibilities and activities now here at OSU?  Sure. From the teaching side, we teach an agricultural law class, which  is an undergraduate class. We teach it in the fall and spring semesters  here. That   s a general survey class of basically all the areas of law that  would touch on an agricultural or an agribusiness operation. We talk  about everything from contracts and real estate to environmental  regulation, wills, trusts, estates, the whole nine yards. We make the joke  that we   re a mile wide and an inch deep, but at least we talk about it,  make everybody aware of those issues. It actually flows very well into  my extension program, which is 70 percent of my appointment.  Teaching is 30 percent. With my extension appointment, we do  agricultural law programming throughout the state, come up with OSU  extension publications to kind of help illuminate issues that would touch  and concern our rural land owners, agricultural producers, agribusiness  owners, again, over the entire range of topics. It   s a broad net that we  cast, so lots of that   s in writing. Lots of that   s now being in presentations  out in the public, visiting with folks one-on-one from Guymon to Idabel.  Actually, from Boise City to Idabel has been my range so far.  From Altus to, what, to     From Altus to Miami. That   s right.  25  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Mercy. So, you   re on the road quite a bit then?  I am. Yes.  So, 70 percent of your time is in extension activities for the college and  then 30 percent in actual teaching here?  Right, that   s correct.  That   s an unusual combination for most instructors, is it not?  It is. It   s actually paid off very well because the two actually  complement one another. The materials that we develop for class  oftentimes are the materials we can easily adapt to teaching out in the  public through extension. The contact that I have with folks through  extension, be they the landowners, agribusiness operators, or anybody of  the like, that gives me some real-world experience and perspective that  we can bring back to the classroom, and you can tell your students,     Look, we   re not talking about theoretical constructs. This is something  that a real landowner faced just a couple weeks ago. So, this happens;  you need to be prepared for it.    That gives some relevance to what we  teach in the classroom.  That   s great. How many students do you advise, Shannon?  Right now I   ve got about twenty students.  Looking down the road, you talked about your first plan change. You  didn   t get wealthy before you came back to Oklahoma State. (Laughs)  Right.  But looking down the road again, what do you hope to accomplish with  your life? What do you hope to contribute to society?  Wow.  Normally, I wouldn   t ask, but knowing the kind of guy you are, Shannon,  you   ve probably got a plan.  (Laughs) I have thought about it. When you   re a young person, you have  these wild aspirations of what you want to do. The thing I always told  myself was that,    Ferrell, I want to make a tangible, positive difference  in the lives of every Oklahoman.    That   s kind of lofty. I   m still  committed to it, and I think that the way to do that is I want to develop a  top-flight agricultural law program here at Oklahoma State University  26  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  second to none in the nation. The reason for that and the reason that I  think that fits well with that goal is that the law in so many aspects is  somewhat intimidating for people. They view it as this veil that they  can   t quite get through when in fact it   s probably more accessible here in  the United States than it is anywhere else. Citizens can make a  difference in effecting change and influencing their policymakers if  they   re willing to devote some effort to it, some study to it, and follow  the channels. I think that if we can do a good job of educating folks  about what the law is, that positions them to make decisions and to  create change as to what they think it should be. I view having a top-flight  program in agricultural law as one thing we can do to make that  change in the lives of Oklahomans.  From the student perspective, it   s not a real concrete goal, which I feel  terrible about because I tell all my students to have really concrete,  distinct goals. But I just want to make as much a difference in the lives  of my students as I can, whether that   s trying to develop the best  advising tools to enable my students to get out of here as quickly as they  want to and as cost effectively as I can. That   s great, but if it   s a student  that has a need, I want to be able to meet that and to let them know that  as a community at OSU we really genuinely care about their success and  about their well-being. Let them know that this is a place to get a degree,  but that   s the merest chunk of the OSU experience. I think the thing that  drew me back to OSU so strongly, the thing I knew I would not be able  to resist, is the fact that while I was here, I never felt more passionately  about what OSU could do to help someone become who they were  meant to be. I mean, this was an amazing place to grow and to become. I  just want to be part of that for students, to help them grow and become  the person that they know they can be if they really want to be.  That   s great, and you   re helping some of the students now with their  dreams too, I understand. Could you talk a little bit about your  participation as a faculty member now in the OSU Scholar Program?  Yes. I started in earnest, but I   ve been really fortunate to reconnect with  all the folks that I worked with in Scholar Development and to work on  the same things we talked about. I   m doing some application review,  doing some of the mock interviews, but what   s really been valuable is  working with students on the front end, helping them as a freshman. Say,     Is this something that I want to pursue, and, if so, how do I map out that  course to do that?    It   s been very exciting for me to be involved again in  every step of that process, and it   s something that I hope to expand my  involvement in the future.  Shannon, could you expand on that just a little bit? I know a couple  of  people  that I   ve had an opportunity to visit with about the program  27  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  have talked about how important it is to identify students early on, some  of them even in high school, then some, of course, as freshmen at  Oklahoma State University. Can you talk a little bit about that  identification process, generally, and about you, specifically?  Sure. It takes a couple of different avenues. The straightforward way of  doing it is you look at the academic records, and, of course, someone  with spectacular ACT scores or a wonderful high school GPA obviously  that stands out, you kind of look at those students. But the more difficult  side of it and the one that involves a little bit more art than science, so to  speak, is just trying to get to know as many students as possible. I mean,  you have to kind of cast a wide net and see if you can get an intuitive  feel for the students that either you think have the opportunity and the  ability to pursue some of those scholarships or to make it known to some  students that you   re a person who can serve as kind of a liaison for that  program. Let them know,    I   m accessible, and if you   re interested come  talk to me and let   s examine what you can do.    It   s a two-pronged  approach, and they   re very different approaches, but you kind of try to  use each to their maximum benefit and try to cast a wide net and get  everyone a chance that you can.  Do you ever go out with Bob Graalman and Bob Spurrier, who heads up  our Honors College? I know   talking to Bob Spurrier, he said that they  go occasionally with the Undergraduate Admissions Office and talk to  high school students every year. Are you ever a part of that? Have a  chance to go out to any of the high school events?  I haven   t had a chance to do that on a formal basis. But the way that I  have done it, I still remain very involved with the 4-H program, and in  that role I try to identify students that I think once we can get them here  to Oklahoma State that we can kind of segue into that program. Another  thing that we   re working on doing and we used to do in the past (we   ve  kind of gotten away from it and we need to revisit it) is using our  extension appointments to our advantage. If we   re out in the counties  talking to folks on a daily basis, let   s incorporate talking to the local  high schools while we   re out there anyway and saying,    Hey, let   s talk  to students who think they might have an interest, and if they want to  pursue these prestigious national scholarships, let   s identify them now,  as well, and let   s position them while they   re still in high school to start  taking advantage of the opportunities that   ll lead them down that road.     Shannon, the Scholars Program, I know, again talking to Bob Spurrier a  little bit about the Honors College, is that an important segue for a lot of  students into the Scholar Development and Recognition Program?  I absolutely think that. That   s one of the things I was very grateful I was  28  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  a part of was the honors program for the reasons that we   ve already  talked about. Again, it was one of those programs that would challenge  you, but the thing that I love about Oklahoma State University is that I  think in many respects our most challenging environments are also our  most supportive environments. When I say that, the Honors College is a  great example. In the Honors College, obviously, there are higher  expectations of our students, and we push them hard. But we also do that  in a smaller classroom environment than most of their classes. We do  that with faculty that are nationally and internationally recognized for  their expertise in those fields. You find yourself as a student in a more  challenging environment but also equipped with more tools than you  might have even if you were part of one of the general courses at the  university. I think that   s a tremendous asset for us.  Do you think the success we   ve had in competing for prestigious  scholarships, has that created a little bit of a buzz out there amongst  some high school students? Has it created an entr  e, if you will, to think  about Oklahoma State University in a different way?  I think so. I think you   re exactly right. I think that in a way it sort of  legitimizes something that we already knew. I mean, I think people  already knew that OSU offered a quality education and that it was a  terrific environment, but maybe it took winning some of those  scholarships for people to say,    Oh, okay, there really is something to  what those Cowboys are doing up there.    Our neighbors to the south  always boast their numbers with respect to National Merit Scholars,  which, by the way, OSU competes with very favorably. We just don   t  tout it as much. But having some Trumans and  a  Rhodes and Udalls  and Goldwater and Fullbrights and on and on and on as we could say, I  think tells people,    Look for the value. OSU really is a tremendous place  to be. Why not tap into that resource that   s in your backyard?     In addition to yourself, can you think of other faculty members that you  consider champions, if you will, for the Scholar Development Program,  that are really passionately involved with it?  Oh, I think so. I   ll focus on my own college here and, not to be too  narrow but, maybe even my own department a little bit. I know that Dr.  Larry Sanders and Dr. Mike Dicks, both of whom teach agricultural  policy courses and have research appointments, have been fantastically  supportive of our candidates and helping them analyze their policy  statements with respect to the Truman, for example. I know that Dr.  Glenn Brown has been very involved in working with our students that  are more inclined toward engineering sciences and helping them see the  policy tie-ins there. Dr. Jeff Hattey, who   s the head of the environmental  science program here in the college, has also helped coordinate our  29  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  students. Our environmental science program is kind of unique here in  the College of Agriculture Sciences and Natural Resources because it  doesn   t have a departmental home. Our environmental sciences students  basically belong to the college, and so that   s actually been an advantage  in that Dr. Hattey doesn   t have departmental boundaries that he really  has to contend with. He can cut across all those departments to pull in  faculty from anywhere that they need for that assistance. Those are the  examples that I   m most familiar with, but I know across the campus we  have faculty from every college that have been wonderfully supportive  of that.  Ed Miller, Associate Dean.  Ed Miller. Dr.  Eric  DeVuyst, also. Very much so.  How does the Scholar Program mesh and synergize with other academic  programs at the college level, university-wide?  I think it   s really kind of an accelerator for those programs because it  provides an opportunity to enrich students that really have a particular  gift or passion for a specific area. But all of our departments have  resource constraints all around them, and there   s only so much that can  be done. The wonderful thing about the Scholar Development Program  is that, again, it knows no departmental bounds, itself. Whether you   re  an ag economist or a political scientist or biologist, mechanical engineer,  it doesn   t matter. It provides an environment for enriching experiences  regardless of your background.  What do you think should be the goals and desired outcomes of the  Scholar Program for, first of all for, Oklahoma State University and  then perhaps for students?  From the perspective of the university, I think the Scholar Development  Program takes   I hate to use this analogy, but it takes a good product  and makes it better. I think it gives us an opportunity as a university to  say,    We   ve got a tremendously gifted and talented student body, and  with that much more investment and support, look at how much more  those students can do.    I think that obviously creates a very high quality  product that our university can showcase and show that OSU is capable  of, but at the same time, I think that also serves as kind of a prototype  for what our academic units can do. I   ve seen it happen, even here at the  College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources. It may not be  formalized, but I   ve seen us as a college more and more start to try to  develop a capacity to identify talented students early on and position  them for greater opportunities with just, again, that much more  preparation and investment. From the student perspective, I think that   s  30  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  a tremendous value-add for our students because all it basically takes is  a student self-identifying, saying that they want to participate in that, and  if they can show some legitimate ability to make good on that, the doors  are thrown open for them very generously. It costs them no more as a  student in terms of tuition dollars, but just their personal effort to  commit to the program as much as those that support it. You have all  those resources made available to you, and it was all just for the asking.  You probably know students in the Scholar Development Program  who   ve unsuccessfully competed for prestigious scholarships. What do  you tell them? I mean, are they failures, or did they benefit from the  program in other ways?  Yes, I   m glad you asked that because I had the opportunity to learn that,  myself, in a scholarship competition that I wasn   t successful in, but I   ve  also known other students that haven   t succeeded at any of the  scholarships they   ve shopped for. What I find encouraging, and it   s not  surprising at all, is that to a person, every one of them has said,    I was  glad I did it.    I   ve never had to talk any of them down or say,    Chin up,  Champ. You   re doing fine.    To a person they   ve all said,    I felt like I  had the best shot I could   ve had because of the support and the help that  I got.    They felt so much richer for the experience and that they, again,  did some things that they wouldn   t have otherwise thought they could  have done and did more than they ever thought was possible anyway,  that they were just so glad to do it, they really didn   t have all that many  regrets.  Shannon, you mentioned the word    richer,    and I   ve heard you refer to  that in our conversation a couple of times. Richer in what ways?  I think that lots of students come to OSU with the thought that you   ve  got to punch your ticket. In today   s workplace, you need to have a  bachelor   s degree.    Okay, I need to have a bachelor   s degree, but what   s  the least-resistance path for me to get from here to a bachelor   s degree?     It   d be easy for us to do that, but I think through involvement with  programs like the Scholar Development Program, we don   t take that  path of least resistance, but we do things that we wouldn   t have  otherwise done. We take the hard courses. I think in so doing, people  realize maybe they were a little smarter than they thought they were,  maybe they were capable of more than they thought they were. As a  result, their target   s no longer a bachelor   s degree. It   s making  meaningful contributions in their profession, or maybe it   s going for a  graduate degree when they hadn   t thought about one previously, but  basically becoming more than they really thought they were.  Maybe an international experience.  31  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Exactly. Exactly.  I appreciate that, thank you. From your unique perspective as a former  student, scholar, now faculty member, how has the university benefited  from the Scholar Program? You mentioned that earlier, but how has the  university, perception-wise regionally and nationally, benefited from the  exposure that we   ve received from these programs?  I think to point to a specific example, being named a Truman Honor  Institution as we were, which is a very prestigious honor and something  that very few non-Ivy League or quote    prestige schools    had ever  received, really woke a lot of people up because they   d never paid  attention to OSU if it wasn   t football season or basketball season. Other  than that, it was just another university out there in middle America. But  I think receiving that honor really made people understand that OSU is a  serious university. This is a place where scholarly activity happens, and  it   s not just any scholarly activity. It   s national- and international-caliber  scholarly activity. We used the word before, but I think that legitimized  a lot of what we do here. It   s not that we changed what we were doing.  We were doing it all along, but now people acknowledge that it was  happening here. Success kind of begets success. You know, people find  out about that, I think that has a tendency to make students consider  OSU that might not have otherwise. Now, if they   re a high school  student and they have aspirations of being a Truman or a Rhodes  Scholar, they know that they can come to OSU and have a chance of  success at that. Whereas previously, maybe they thought they had to go  somewhere else to do that.  Out of state and Ivy, something like that?  Exactly, somewhere with a lot higher tuition bill. (Laughs)  In your opinion, what have been the strengths and successes of the  Scholar Development Program through the years?  I think it provided an opportunity for our faculty who wanted to make a  contribution above and beyond just the classroom to really have an  opportunity to do that. We have some fantastic classroom teachers here  at the university, but I think there were a lot of folks out there that said,     I want to do something in addition to that. How can I have another  opportunity to interact with students? Beyond the honors program, as  well, which is another opportunity to work with excellent students, but  how can we exceed even that?    I think another success that we   ve had is  our faculty has been so motivated to succeed in whatever we do because  it   s just a wonderful group of individuals. I think we   ve done a very  good job of understanding the selection processes and criteria for a vast  32  Gill  Ferrell  number of scholarships. For the Trumans, the Rhodes, the Udalls, the  Goldwaters, Javises, we could go on and on and on. But every time we  come across a scholarship, we have a group of people that kind of focus  on that and really deconstruct it, really understand what kind of  candidate are they looking for, how can we identify that kind of student,  what   s a successful application, what   s not a successful application,  what   s a successful interview and an unsuccessful interview, and helping  our students train in a focused way and still a genuine way. I don   t mean  it to sound as though we game the system or anything like that, but I  think we do a good job at knowing what those processes require for  success and genuinely developing that in the students that have a desire  to pursue that opportunity.  Shannon, did I hear you saying, too, one of the successes, perhaps one of  the strengths, has been the interaction between faculty and students in a  special way? We talked about the Freshman and Wentz Research  Scholarship Program. We talked about, of course, the preparation, the  training, the helping with the applications, but that intellectual  engagement, if you will, between students and faculty, how important is  that?  I think it   s true; I think that   s huge. I would point out a couple of  elements of that. Number one, I always told my advisees and my  students,    We professors are humans. We like for people to be interested  in the same stuff that we   re interested in. And if you talk to your  professor outside of class, oh my gosh, it   s like Christmas came early  because it   s like,    Wow, they   re really interested in the stuff I   m talking  about. They   re not just trying to get a grade.       This is that writ large  because you can find a student who   s passionate about the thing that  you   re passionate about as well, and it gives you an opportunity to work  with that student who so many faculty, I think, really crave. They would  love to have a student come to them outside a class setting and say,    I  just want to learn more about your area.    How gratifying is that for an  instructor? So, this is an opportunity through the Scholar Development  Program where we can take that and point it in a direction and really  make it pay off both for student and for faculty member.  The other side of that is that it creates an opportunity for a mentoring  relationship where that opportunity might not have existed otherwise.  It   s not as though we have, like, formal assignments or any sort of really  formalized program, but I   ve never known of a faculty member in the  course of the Scholar Development Program who didn   t enthusiastically  embrace a student even if they weren   t from their own department.  Harking back to the example of Courtney Timmons, I mean, Courtney  was a biosystems engineering student, the furthest thing you could be  from an ag economist almost. I worked very closely with Courtney on  33  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  her application because it had some environmental aspects to it, which  fit my private practice days. I thought absolutely nothing of it just  because I was so joyed to work with someone so passionate about what  they did that I was happy to do it. Again, we wouldn   t have had that  opportunity had it not been for the Scholar Development Program.  Many universities developed their Scholar Programs similar to how  Oklahoma State University did, and the competition for prestigious  scholarships, already fierce, is becoming even more competitive. What  changes will OSU have to make, and what components will we need to  enhance to remain competitive in this environment going forth?  I think number one, and we   ve already kind of mentioned this, is, again,  trying to identify those folks as early as possible. I think that the key is  almost reaching back there into high school and positioning our students,  saying,    Look, as you finish up your junior and senior year, let   s start  doing these things that will help you open up these opportunities once  you come to campus that will position you as a stand-out candidate for  the scholarship.    I think we   ll probably have to get more creative in our  course offerings because to date we   ve done a lot with the already  existing courses that we have and trying to enrich that experience.  We   ve had a couple of courses that have been created, basically to  advance the Scholar Development Program. I think we   re going to have  to do more of that. But, again, with our faculty and with our students I  think there are a lot of opportunities to put some course offerings out  there that not only provide the content to help advance our students  intellectually, but I think we can provide some very meaningful  experiences and meaningful service opportunities that will set our  candidates apart.  What comes to mind is the new innovations class which we have here in  the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources that cuts  across a number of our departments. It   s jointly taught by our ag  economics, agricultural communications, biosystems, ag engineering. I  mean, basically all of our departments share in this class where students  take on real world issues and come up with real world solutions that real  world companies go out and implement. That again is something that  very few undergraduates have the opportunity to do, to work with the  private sector like that. We   ve got that culture of innovation here at  OSU, and I think if we tap into it, we can provide some offerings that  will really advance our candidates compared to everyone else.  You think giving students more international opportunities, more  opportunities to do internships here in the US and Oklahoma, these  kinds of things, is that what area you   re saying?  34  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  I think that   s exactly right. I   m so encouraged by the strides that we   ve  made in international study here at OSU. If I had one regret about my  academic career, I wish I would have spent more time in international  study because I had one international study experience which was  tremendous. I wish I would have done more of that. I think that is very  important, and, again, I think the practical real world experiences where  people as students make a difference is going to be very important.  Because at any university you can take classes, you can make good  grades, you can do research. It   s much more difficult, but much more  rewarding, also, I think, to have those sorts of real world impacts where  you can say,    Hey, I put my money where my mouth was. I went out, I  rolled up my sleeves and I, you know, did it,    so to speak.  What will be critical to the Scholar Program   s continued success? What  kind of resources do we need to provide for it, and what do we need to  do?  I think   wow, this is going to sound like an ag economist   s answer, but  it always comes back to dollar signs, right? I think some additional  financial support is important, but let me explain. It   s not just that  throwing money at the problem solves it, which clearly it doesn   t. It  takes time to engage in this sort of activity. I mean, you   ve got time  spent in application. You   ve got time spent in preparation. You may be  taking more hours than you absolutely have to take. That costs money. I  don   t want to ever see our students not pursue this objective because of a  financial constraint. I think that having some scholarship dollars to  defray costs of things like our international study or just providing more  scholarship dollars so that a student may not have to work as much and  thus free up some time for them to pursue the things they need to be  doing to advance their candidacy. I think that   s very important. I think  the more money that we could have for undergraduate research  experience the better because, again, as we   ve talked about, that has  tremendous value to our candidates. And then, that may not be  something that we do centrally through Scholar Development. That  might just be something that we all have to look at as a university to say,     We recognize that so much of our research dollars goes toward the  graduate student level, but let   s make a concerted, conscious effort to see  how we can allocate research dollars to enabling undergraduates to  participate in those experiences, as well.     Shannon, would it make any sense at all to think about some release  time from teaching, as opposed to putting more staff on Bob Graalman   s  team, but to maybe give faculty support to quarter time, let them in there  to help with the program or to be more engaged? Is that something  you   ve thought about?  35  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Gill  I think that makes a lot of sense. I think that we   ve benefited so much  from people that just did it out of their sheer good nature. They want to  see students succeed, but there   s really not a vehicle for those faculty  members to receive any sort of professional recognition for that, from  the perspective of evaluation as the advancement of their academic  career through promotion and tenure or as any virtue of their  appointment. But, by gosh, that provides a lot of value to the university,  and I think it is a valuable professional contribution. We just lack a  vehicle for recognizing that, and that might be the low-hanging fruit, so  to speak, to enable us to do that.  Shannon, we   ve had a lot of conversation. I appreciate your answers  and your insight. Is there an aspect we haven   t talked about that you   d  like to cover, some comments you   d like to make as we conclude here?  I was trying to think. Is there anything we haven   t talked about? It may  be going back on the last issue we talked about. We   ve benefited so  tremendously from the willingness of our administration to support the  Scholar Development office and to take Bob Graalman, who used to do  this as kind of a part-time gig himself, to move in that. That   s been one  of the most tremendous single moves, is giving Bob the kind of the  reigns to really purse this, his passion, full-time. That   s tremendous. I  can   t say enough how grateful I was to all of the faculty members who  took their time when it wasn   t recognized. It was just them being them,  loving what they do, to help me out because I know I would not be  where I am or doing what I   m doing had it not been for them. I   m  constantly encouraged to see that that cycle keeps continuing and there  are evermore faculty members that want to be a part of that. I think our  students are so much richer for it.  I   ve heard a couple comments that perhaps we should look into maybe  endowing our program or at least as part of our next comprehensive  campaign that   s on the horizon to invest some time and fundraising to  support the Scholar Program.  Without a doubt. Without a doubt because I don   t know that there could  be any higher return on an endowment investment than putting it right  there. As somebody who grew up in extension, we were always trying to  figure out how to beg and plead the county commissioners to come up  with a budget. Having an endowment, a pot of money that is solely  dedicated to that purpose, gives tremendous security. That security is so  valuable because when you quit worrying about where the next budget   s  going to come from and you can focus on what you   re meant to be  doing, that   s tremendously liberating, I think, to anybody.  Any further comments, Shannon?  36  Ferrell  Gill  Ferrell  Just none other than to say I   m just tremendously proud and excited to  be part of the story of the Scholar Development Office, and I hope there  are lots more stories to come.  We   ve got some coming down the pike. (Laughter) Thanks, Shannon, I  appreciate it.  Thank you, Jerry.  -------  -------
