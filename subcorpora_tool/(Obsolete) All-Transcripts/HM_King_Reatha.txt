Speaker 1: All right.  My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Ma'am, can you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My full name is Reatha Clark King, spelled, Reatha, R-E-A-T-H-A, Clark, C-L-A-R-K, King, K-I-N-G.
Speaker 1: Okay, and is there a story about the name Reatha?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It wasn't originally Reatha.  It was originally Recie, R-E-C-I-E.  And I got that name because when my uncle came to visit my mother just as I was born, his name was Reecie, Reece, and, well, my mother said, name him after, after Reece, her brother, Reece, her oldest brother.  And Clark was not my name then, as you know, got married later.  But my maiden name was Bell--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so I was named Recie Bell, B-E-L-L, Clark.  And my grandmother, midwife, delivered me and apparently, she wrote it or somebody wrote my name down on the birth certificate wrong.  So I went through the years, not sure of how it should be spelled.  And in different schools, it started to get written in different ways.  So eventually, I got a birth certificate, and I saw all of these--I saw my name written on there, Recie Bell Clark.  And by that time, I was being called Reatha, Reatha, R-E-A-T-H-A.  So along the way, my birth certificate was changed.  So it is Reatha Bell Clark, B-E-L-L-E, though.  So--
Speaker 1: Oh, so okay.
Speaker 2: That's--
Speaker 1: But your maiden name was Belle initially?
Speaker 2: No, my maiden name was Clark.
Speaker 1: Clark, oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Right, C-L-A-R-K.
Speaker 1: Okay, but the Belle was still without the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.  But that's, that's the way I got the name Reatha.  It evolved from Recie.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: April 11, 1938, Pavo, Georgia.  Pavo is spelled P-A-V-O.
Speaker 1: All right, and ma'am, what is your occupation.

So I focus on corporate boards, corporate boards of directors, serving on them, teaching seminars on how to be a good director and also doing writings and articles, along with my speeches.  I serve on many panels at conferences on how to be a very effective director.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, but you're trained as a chemist.  You're a PhD in Chemistry, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I'm a chemist.  I'm a chemist, is--was an expert research chemist for a number of years.  And that was my professional, my education, formal education was first chemistry and mathematics at Clark College in Atlanta, Georgia, and then later a Doctorate in Chemistry at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]; got a Master's and a Doctorate in Chemistry.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, we're gonna get into the education part.  I just wanted to know, to establish that you have a PhD in Chemistry.
Speaker 2: Yes.

Story_ID: 20501
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family, and then I'm gonna ask about your father's side so we can keep track of one side and the other.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So first I'd like for you to give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name, married--well, married to my father, it was Ola Mae Watts Clark, C-L-A-R-K.  Her maiden name was Watts.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you spell the whole name for us?
Speaker 2: Ola, O-L-A, Mae, M-A-E, Watts, W-A-T-T-S, Clark, C-L-A-R-K.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And later, though, she, when she and--after she and my father were divorced, she later remarried.  Do you want me to give you that married name?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: And her second husband's name--well, then her name became Ola Mae Watts Campbell, C-A-M-P-B-E-L-L.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is December 17, 1918, Pavo, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how far back can you trace your mother's side of the family?  What do you know about your ancestors and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, they were all farmers, farmers and the work was field work.  I can trace my mother's side of the family back to my maternal grandmother's mother to--I can, so I can trace her side of the family back to her grandmother.
Story_ID: 20502
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is to your great grandmother?
Speaker 2: My great grandmother, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Lucy Brinson, B-R-I-N-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you know, was she born in the same area?
Speaker 2: She was born in the same area, South Georgia, I would say.  Yes, she was in the same area, but I would say South Georgia, and as you know, a lot of little towns clustered together down there and not that far apart.  But in those days, they seemed far apart because of limited transportation.  But it was in the same area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Lucy Brinson, and then I--do you want me to talk about my grandmother or go on to--
Speaker 1: That's the oldest ancestor you have a record of?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What do you know about her, and what were aspirations or are there any stories about her that have passed down?
Speaker 2: Yes.  The stories that I knew about are the parts where she lived with my grandmother.  And my grandmother was taking care of her mother when I was in grade school and when I got to know my great grandmother.  She was, she did not live alone.  She lived with my mother--my grandmother.  And I recall my grandmother's sister, you know, coming to the house to visit their mother.  And the people in the community would refer to her as Lucy Brinson.  So that is the earliest generation, but all I knew about her was the time when observing the way she lived with her, her daughter, my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Do you have any idea what her date of birth was?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  I, I wouldn't know, wouldn't know her date of birth.
Speaker 1: I'd say it'd have to be the 1880s, I guess, I would have to think at the earliest or--
Speaker 2: I would think so, I would think so because this was around 1940s or about 1940 that I have the recollection of this situation.  And, oh, my grandmother [great] was much more than forty years old at that time.  Yeah, she was, she might have been as old as eighty at that time.
Speaker 1: And so she would, yeah.
Speaker 2: She was, she was elderly.
Speaker 1: Going back to the, now, was she a person that remembered slavery or was she the daughter of slaves?
Speaker 2: Definitely, I feel she was a daughter of slaves.  But, you know, we never took an oral history and talked with her about that.
Speaker 1: She never talked about slavery or--
Speaker 2: No, no, I never heard her talk about it.  But definitely, I would say she must have been the daughter of slaves.
Story_ID: 20503
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, you knew your--what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: My grandmother's name was Mamie Watts, M-A-M-I-E, Watts, W-A-T-T-S.  And she was, her maiden name would have been Brinson, Mamie Brinson Watts, W-A-T-T-S.  And she was, well, I would--do you want me to describe her?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: I remember her clearly, a nice-looking lady, religious, really feisty and very feisty and, illiterate though.  She couldn't read and write.  And that had significant connections to me.  But she was religious, churchgoer and she could shout in church.  She would shout a lot in church.  But she would fix herself up and I got to know her much better after my grandfather died.  So, and I lived with her at one point.  So I got to know my grandmother well.  She had seven sons and five daughters by her husband.  And so she gave birth to actually--and she had one child who died, and I think it was a son.  So she had thirteen children herself.  She gave birth to thirteen children.  And I got to know my uncles and aunts well.  But my, after my grandfather died, my grandmother lived by herself in the community.  And one of her sons who went to World War II [1939-1945] served in the Army sent her, you know, the check.  She, she was--those who were not married had their monthly check come to their mom.  And she bought herself a house to live with that money.  And I was one of the grandchildren who was, who was asked to live with her so she would not be living by herself.  She also had two, a young son who was at home.  And so she was, my grandmother then got to be the head of a household herself.  And she had some, she was opinionated, some strong views.  But all the people around the community knew her as Mamie Watts.  She, she had her own property there, her little, about five acres that her house was sitting on and her own house and her own home.  And that meant a lot to her.  But people always told--my mother [Ola Mae Watts Clark] always told me that I looked like Mamie.  And I,--her mom, and she and my mom were very close.  But, oh, they were teasing her all the time.  They thought she had a boyfriend, you know, how those jokes (laughter) go about in the community.  And naturally, it was a preacher that she liked very much.  And the word about the, this small town was that she had a crush on this Reverend Larking.  And we went to his church.  We attended his church.  So, he was a bachelor, but that was the word about the community.  But I think my grandmother would have loved any preacher.  She was just a religious, praying woman.  And, yeah, I--but she loved her children.  And she always loved having her sons looking for--she was looking forward to her sons coming home from the Army.  And I was, got up to be about third or fourth grade, I became her letter writer.  I was literate.  I could write letters.  I could write.  So I would, I would write to her sons for her.  And she would talk to me about the burden of being illiterate.  And that left an impression on me my whole life, I think, of why education is important.  She, she would tell me about how difficult it was to ask people to write for you.  And my father would tell me the same thing because he could not read and write.  But anyway that, my grandmother's story was around trying to get along as head of the household.  And it was, it was quite a story.
Speaker 1: Okay, now are there any stories about your grandmother you remember, about any specific incidents?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, one in particular.  It was about 1945.  She and I were walking.  This was, it was something around the announcement of World War--the end of the War.  She and I were walking down this dirt road in a little town called Merrillville, Georgia M-E-R-R-I-L-L-V-I-L-E.  And we were walking--and we would walk everywhere because she didn't have a car, and she couldn't drive.  She would get rides with people.  But she, we were walking to the store, and this white man came along on a pickup truck, driving a pickup truck.  And he stopped, and he said, Mamie, the War is over.  He had gotten news that the War was over.  And I remember her words, exactly.  "Thank God Almighty, my sons will be coming home."  She had several sons serving in World War II at the time.  And I could, I could taste dust now of that dirt road.  And, well, naturally, it would be some time before that happened, and they would be out of the Army.  But those were her words.  I, I remember that specifically.  Other than that, it was the matter of just going to church every Sunday morning, every Sunday morning and waiting for dinner on the church grounds, you know, as they served food.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of your church, family church?
Speaker 2: It was not--I'm going to think about it.  It was right in Merrillville [Georgia].  My later church was Mother Easter Baptist Church [Moultrie, Georgia], so that wasn't it.  I'll have to think about it, that one.
Speaker 1: All right, but it was a Baptist church?
Speaker 2: It was a Baptist church.  Now, there's another church that's more significant in my mind because it was my school too.  But that was much earlier.
Story_ID: 20504
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, did your mother's--your mother [Ola Mae Watts Clark] was part of a huge family--well, was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that considered big in those days, having thirteen?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was considered big, but it was not too unique because I know a lot of her friends, they had large families too (unclear).  But it was big, but not unique.  And, and, you know, the large families were needed to work on the farms and to make ends meet.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was big, but not unique.
Speaker 1: Yeah, nowadays, well, you know, people have two children.  Well, there are still big families, but not like down South in those days, I guess.
Speaker 2: It's unique now to have (laughter)--
Speaker 1: So did your mother's generation, did they go to school and have a chance to go to school?
Speaker 2: Generally not.  They were, they did not get much schooling the way I recall it.  Her--going up to the third grade or maybe the fourth grade.  My mother went to school to the third grade.  So she was educated up to that level.  My father--no, no, and my mother's sister, youngest sister, got more schooling than her, than the other children.  My mother had four sisters, so it was five girls.  My--I don't think any of them were educated through grade school.  They might have gotten up to fifth or sixth grade, but I don't recall any of them completing high school.  And I don't recall any of her brothers completing high school, except maybe the youngest one.  His name was R.B.  He lived with my grandmother at one time.
Speaker 1: Now, was there a high school in Merrillville [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: No, no, there was not.  I remember fondly that we rode the bus to Coolidge, Georgia, Coolidge.  And there was an elementary school in Coolidge, Georgia.  Remember, we're talking about an elementary school for blacks.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The schools were segregated then, and if I recall correctly, the blacks had to go either to Moultrie or Thomasville for high school.  But there was an elementary school in Coolidge, Georgia, C-O-O-L-I-D-G-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there wasn't an elementary school in Merrillville either?
Speaker 2: No, no, there was not an elementary school in Merrillville.
Speaker 1: And then you'd have to go to high school in Moultrie?
Speaker 2: In Moultrie, that's right.  That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, okay, now, so did your mother talk about--I mean what were her aspirations growing up, and what--did she wanna go further in school or did she think it was possible, you know, in those days?
Speaker 2: She, my mother, my mother's aspiration for education was for us, through us.  Her, she had three daughters.  And her aspiration was for us to get an education.  My mother was an attractive lady who got married at either nineteen or twenty years old.  And she had, early on, my sister, oldest sister was born.  Then I came along, and then my younger sister was born in 1940.  So that gives you the War years, you know.  It shows you where, how things were.  My oldest sister was born in '36 [1936].
Story_ID: 20505
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to ask you for all the names in a minute, but I just wanted to--at this point, can you tell me if your mother had any stories about growing up that she shared about race relations down there or, or--because Georgia was, that part of Georgia sounds like it was pretty rough, to me, I mean as you have described it.
Speaker 2: It was.  The stories I heard about race relations were all about staying in your place and not having a conflict with the law.  And things were segregated.  Blacks were, you know, to, not to use fountains.  They were not to be in stores and not to be in certain places, unless it was a place for the Colored, the Colored section of town.  So not violating those boundaries.  That's what you would, that had been set for black people.  So that you would hear about.  And then the other stories you would hear about were how worker--how you were treated as workers in people's home.  You would hear others, hear your parents say, that man is good to blacks.  He's a good person to work for.  Oh, he's bad.  He's a mean person.  You would hear them talk about being treated badly.  And so it was, there were a lot of, it was a lot of caution to younger blacks, especially, black boys, black men, "Don't do anything out of place" because you get put in jail or you, you get talked badly about, you know, or scolded and, or the white man will come and talk to your parents about you.  "You'd better take care of that boy; you better teach that boy how to talk to others."  And don't be belligerent, you know.  Don't show any annoyance, and don't feel, show that you are offended if you're insulted.  For example, being called "boy", "that boy" or "uncle".  If you were a grown man, and you were a black man, nine times out of ten, you would be called "uncle" or "auntie" if you were an older woman.  So, but now that's an insult.  We think it's an insult, but don't you show reaction to it.  That's the kind of mindfulness my parents had about the races, staying in your place and not being deprived of things that you needed to get along with, deprived of pay for your work, the work that you had been doing, and I think there was a lot of underpayment of people for their, for their services and their work.  But you didn't complain about that, you know.  We were sharecroppers.  We were sharecroppers.  So we were quite mindful of being, of being robbed of what we would do.  And you heard a lot of stories about that because people would go to the boss and borrow money before the crops were gathered.  And you hear people, overhear people saying, you won't have anything at the end of the season when the tobacco is sold because they're gonna--they tell you don't have anything coming to you.  You borrowed it already.
Speaker 1: Now, just for the sake of those who are watching this and don't know what a sharecropper is.  Sharecropper is renting basically, land, and has to share the crop with the owner, right--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right--
Speaker 1: --whatever you plant.
Speaker 2: --that's sharecropper.  Yeah, you don't own the land yourself.  You're renting, you're living on a farm and housing that's set aside for workers.  And you're really not sharing the crop.  You're just working for the people, the owners.  And now--
Speaker 1: And get a share, I guess.
Speaker 2: You, it's possible that you could have a little land, and you can do some of your own farming and take it to market.  But I'd never seen that happen, that, say my father who would take the cotton to the gin [cotton gin] and say, that's mine.  It's always Mr. John's crop, you know, that you were taking.  You shared the resources out there in that your house was sitting on the land that the, the landlord owned.  And your rent, perhaps was forgiven, maybe, could have been forgiven in return for the work that you would do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, where's the income?  Is there any income in this?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at the end of--sometimes there would, you would have some income at the end of the crop--at the end of the season, you were supposed to have some pay, something coming to you, if you hadn't borrowed it already.  Frankly, I don't know, I don't recall specifically what the pay arrangement was, but it was--there was no, not that much free cash flow to you in return for your services.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, let me ask you this question too.  The lack of schooling in a situation like that would mean that it would also probably mean that you couldn't count as well as, or keep track of the money as to what's owed and what's--is that true?
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's true.  See, that was the burden of illiteracy again.  You, they have cheated you out, you'd hear that said, that expression all the time, they cheated you what was due you because you couldn't count, and you couldn't keep records of what you had borrowed.  You couldn't write.  You just could--you were beholding to them because you were dependent on them to be honest.  And then, now, you could--some farmers, black farmers taught themselves how to read and write and how to do numbers, we called it.  We didn't call it mathematics.  It was how to do numbers.  Or some people could keep track in their heads.  One of my father's gifts was that he had a good mind, a good head, we called it.  He could figure things out.  But you didn't have the, enough formal education to be able to keep records of what was, of what you--versus what you were borrowing, what you were promised, what you had used up.  And again, that's one of the cost to you of being illiterate.  And my mother could write well enough, eventually, to write a letter to me, say when we lived away from home, and I lived in school.  But there would be a lot of misspelled, misspelled words, but I could figure out what she was saying.  She was, she was literate enough for that.  And she, I have some of her letters around that I hold onto.  I cherish them now.  But, and she went to school later to learn to, to take a cooking class that the government was sponsoring for low-income families out at an Air Force base after I got to college.  And when learned how to vote, she, she and my stepfather first voted, and they were so proud of that.  But you see, that was another cost of illiteracy.  People didn't participate in other things either.  But back--
Speaker 1: Oh, let, can I--we have to pause here to make a notation, but we'll--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 20506
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, well, let me--oh, well, you were in the middle of something when I stopped.  So I don't wanna break--do you remember what you were--
Speaker 2: We talked about my mother's [Ola Mae Watts Clark] aspiration for our education, her daughters' education and what that aspiration was.  I, we didn't get far on that, but it was significant and so was my dad's aspirations.
Speaker 1: Now, let's go to your father.  And, can you give me his full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: His full name is Willie, W-I-L-L-I-E, B. Clark, C-L-A-R-K.
Speaker 1: And what does the "B" stand for?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, I thought you were going to ask that.  I'll have to find out and I'll be sure to get it to you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He has a sister today.  She's 94 years old.  She lives in Poughkeepsie, New York, and I can get that for you.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Now, his date of birth was--frankly, I don't have the exact date, but I can, I'll give you the year.  His date of birth must have been about 1917 or 1918.  He died in 1969 at age 51.  So I'm subtracting here, 51 from 69.  So it was about, he and my mother were about the same age.
Speaker 1: Now, was he born in the same area?
Speaker 2: No, no.  He was born up in, in North Georgia.  He was born to a family of thirteen children, eleven sisters and two boys.  He and his brother were the only males, boys in the family.  Their mother died early, and they were raised by an older sister.  And after their mother died, his oldest sister moved them to South Georgia to Pavo, that area of Pavo, Georgia, and that's where he and my mother met in, around Pavo.  But he was not born in the--as a matter of fact, I think he was born in a town, around the town of Brunswick [Georgia].  I'm in the process of sort of deposing my aunt to get all of this information.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she, she has a very clear memory of those years.  But he, he--they moved to Pavo [Georgia] and, and started, settled on a farm in Pavo, and that's where my father met my mother.
Story_ID: 20507
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask you about that story, but first, I wanna ask what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?  Do you have--
Speaker 2: I have--my, yes, I, I--
Speaker 1: Did you know his [Willie B. Clark] parents and grandparents?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't know his parents.  I have the picture of his father.  And I'm frankly unsure that that's his father.  But my aunt sent it to me with, just in an envelope, with no note on it.  And it's George Washington Clark.  That was the name, George Washington Clark, and that didn't surprise me too much because it was not uncommon for children to--black children to be named after some white figure, you know, George Washington Clark.  And this is a striking looking gentleman, could very much be like, look like my aunt and father.  Like the picture of my father that I have, my father had a lot poise.  He was illiterate.  He could not read and write, but he had a lot of poise.  And he could pray in church.  Oh, he could get on his knees.  I remember that clearly, get down on his knees and prayer, prayer to God.  And you'd think that he was composing it like some poet, you know, his prayers.  And his sisters, I got to know my aunts on my father's side well.  They were caring people, and even after my mother and father separated, they stayed close to my mom and encouraged us.  And I, they were, they were very attractive people, I always thought.  And they, I loved the way they carried themselves.  They were sophisticated acting, but they were--they were not educated.  And my mother made the comment once that they were--when her family got to know them, said my father's family were a pitiful group, a pitiful group of people because they had--it was so many children, and they had no clothes.  They just were pitiful and I got, I got to know his sister who raised them up.  She's dead now, and, but I got to know her.
Speaker 1: Is there a story as to how they, you know, why they faired worse up on Brunswick [Georgia] than, and moved to Pavo [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: I'm sure there is, and my aunt would know it.  I think that her name, she is--she lives in, up in New York in that assisted living place.  She would know it.  But I, I'm sure there is a story of how they got--now, they got dispersed once they got down, got further South because after the married.  My, the oldest sister stayed around Pavo, and, but the--one of the sisters moved to Belle Glade, Florida and worked in the sugar cane industry.  And then my--that's where my father went when he and my mother separated.  That's where he died.  But to answer your question, exactly what triggered their moving to South Georgia, I don't, I don't know.  I'll have to research that question.  That's a--and one of the sisters ended up in Atlanta, Georgia.  And I talked with her before she died on the telephone, and I was told by one aunt, the one who's in New York, that the sister in Atlanta, Georgia didn't wanna have anything to do with them, down in South Georgia.  She happened to get up to Atlanta [Georgia] and ran into some good luck.  And she did not wanna identify with her sisters who were so poor and helpless down in South Georgia.  So.
Speaker 1: Now, could his sisters read and write or did they, were they--
Speaker 2: One could, and she's deceased now.  But her name was Marie.  Marie used to write to me and send me money when I was at Clark, $5.00 at a time, you know, in an envelope.  So their reading and writing ability was spotty amongst them.  And I think, I don't know how, whether Marie got a little schooling once she got to South Georgia.  But she was, my mother said she was a smart woman anyway up here.  She said Marie was smart, and, but Marie loved living on the farm.  She loved working in the field.  And I, my mother said that's what killed her.  I heard her say, Marie ought to stay out of that field.  She ought to stay out of that field up in the years.  But on, my father's side of the story.  Their mother died young.  They were raised by the older sister.  It was a lot of girls in the family, and my aunt tells me, she says we have Indian in our blood.  You know, the talk like that.  You hear that comment that we have Indian in our blood.
Speaker 1: But that's a, but there's no explanation as to what she meant?
Speaker 2: No, no.  They--
Speaker 1: Now, what happened to your father's father?  Was he, I mean after--was he around when your father was being raised?
Speaker 2: I think, I don't know where, whether he was around after their mom died.  I got the impression he was around somehow.  I'm thinking he got ill and the burden fell on my older sister.  As a matter of fact, my aunt, my father's [Willie B. Clark] sister, said that her mother, once she knew she was going to die, she asked Nig--that's what they called the older sister, to take care of the younger ones.  She, she said she had, she told Nig to take care of, of the younger children.  But she didn't mention her, their dad, what happened to him.  My father eventually, well, he would get drunk.  He would, he had a drinking problem too, you know, which was very common.  On the weekend, people, men, they would borrow money from their boss and drink, drink it up.  And he had, he did have a drinking problem.  And I don't know whether alcohol was a--home brew.  That was it.  This was a problem with his, on his side of the family too.  But all in all, the records are spotty and the stories are oral stories, you know, that's passed on through, through the generations.
Story_ID: 20508
Speaker 1: Okay, so, then, now, is there any central story out of your father's side of the family as you remember before I ask you how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Any central stories out of my father's [Willie B. Clark]--
Speaker 1: Any central story they talk about that, something that happened to the family or something that happened to somebody in the family that they--
Speaker 2: No, I've heard him talk about his brother who was younger and I don't know whether they were half brothers.  That was typical too, but, you know, my mother [Ola Mae Watts Clark] had half-brothers as well as whole brothers.  I don't know.  I really, no, I didn't hear my father talk about their family.  He was quite differential to his sisters, particularly, the older sister, Nig.  And, but he didn't, I didn't hear him talk about his, his family much.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, he didn't serve in the War, did he?
Speaker 2: No, he did not, he did not.  He didn't serve in the Armed Services at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what is the story?  How did your parents meet?
Speaker 2: How did they what?
Speaker 1: Meet.
Speaker 2: Meet.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I got the impression they met through church, the community church which is the gathering place.  I, I got that impression that--that was the social network, the social networking happened in the church.  But, and that's--then it ends up they decide who's courting whom.  And that's where courtship started.  That was my impression.  And at that time, it was common for the man to go to the girl's house, and they would have "company" in the house, like the man who--the boyfriend would come and sit at the girl's house and they, you know, you called that having company.  And you kept your living room fixed up because that's where people wanna sit.  And then you decide when you're gonna get married.  If you get married, then the rumors start in the community who's going with whom.  But I think it, the church became the meeting ground for people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it could happen on, in the work environment too on farms.  School attendance, and it could happen in schools where there was some schooling.  But basically, as I'm going to explain later, that was the church because the, in segregated communities, the church doubled as the school.  But I, I think it--so, basically, it started in the church.
Story_ID: 20509
Speaker 1: Okay, now, can you describe your parents' personalities and kind of tell us who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's easy.  And that's a delightful story.  I, I have traits from both parents [Ola Mae Watts Clark and Willie B. Clark].  My mother was an outgoing woman, friendly, caring, and curious.  She, she was one who had strong awareness of other people.  She could be quiet, but she was observant.  She did not ignore anyone.  She had quite a, she was mild mannered, but she had a pretty strong presence herself.  I, I do think I have many qualities that my mother had.  On my father's side, I, my father was a thinker, and I think I have some of that trait from him.  And he was one who would leave people alone, and he would--he was an observing person, but he, he did not push confrontation with anyone.  And he could, he could look over confusion too.  He, my father was, I would say friendly.  He was a friendly man and well liked.  Both my parents were well liked by others.  They, they were sort of magnets for other people.  And pretty social, he was social.  But my mother was more talkative, I think, than he was.  I, my father would, I'd hear him talking to other men and his common expression was, "You're lying, you're lying" (laughter).  He would challenge somebody like that, in a kidding kind of way.  You're lying.  He was a big man, and had sort of a reddish tone.  One of our sons looks sort of like him.  But he, and he was a strong person in that, the field work he did.  You could feel that, worked long hours.  But they, in summary, they were likeable.  They were friendly, and they were, they carried themselves well, upright, respected by, by--in the community, respected.  And people called her Ola, and they called him preacher.  I've never heard anybody call him Willie, Willie B.  He had that nickname, Preacher Clark, and that's what they always called him.
Story_ID: 20510
Speaker 1: Okay, now, can you name your brothers and sisters, I mean your family, I mean your other siblings in order that they come?
Speaker 2: Yes, well, one came before me, oldest sister, Mamie.  Mamie, named after my grandmother, Mamie, Mamie Lee, Mamie Lee Clark.  And I don't know where the 'Lee' came from, but Mamie Lee.  Then I was born, and then my older sister was born, it was September 3, I think, 1936.  And I was born '38 [1938], April 11, 1938 and my youngest sister was born, May, I think it was May 12th or so, 1940.  So we were about one year and seven months apart.
Speaker 1: So it's three of you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Three sisters?
Speaker 2: And my youngest sister is named Dorothy.  Dorothy Ola, O-L-A.  Her middle name is after my mother.  And she was, she's the one who's deceased.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My younger sister, now, you're coming to probably the traits of us, how different we were or how similar.
Speaker 1: No, you can tell me (laughter).
Speaker 2: My older sister and I were pretty close.  We have, my oldest sister took on the role of being sort of the leader in the family, especially after my mother [Ola Mae Watts Clark] and father [Willie B. Clark] separated.  And we were pretty close.  She was good in school, and I tried to model her, be good in school too, for example.  She learned to sew and knit in school, and I tried, I did the same because that's the way we helped ourselves with our clothes.  My oldest sister was fair skinned, a little fairer than mine.  And everybody would see her and say, you're just like Ola.  They thought that she looked just like my mother.  I've heard people say that over and over, Mamie Lee, Mamie Lee, you look just like Ola.  And she was, my, she wanted, she somehow wanted to be a nurse, said she wanted to be a nurse from early on.  Now, where she learned about being a nurse, I don't know, but she did become a nurse along the way and went to Dillard University [New Orleans, Louisiana] to become a nurse.  And I was, people always--well, my uncles teased my mother saying that child is very independent.  They saw me as independent, and I don't know.  People say you have the middle-child syndrome.  You're the middle child.  And one of my uncles told my mom that, that child is gonna move away from here, and she's gonna live a long ways off, some--one of these days because they saw me as having an independent spirit.  Well, at that time, we all had to look forward to going up North for opportunity because of segregation.  So, a lot of people moved away, you know, as part of the migration North for better opportunity.  My younger sister, Dorothy, was, had the name of being the pet in the family.  She was a pet.  She would, she, and, but she was--she had a lot of hair.  And she, you know, we would all sit to get our hair platted.  That was a ritual that you went through Saturday because you had to be ready for church Sunday.  And Dorothy, Dorothy never did any work.  My older sister and I had to do the chores.  And we, we were smart in the field too.  We would be sent to the field to pick cotton, gather crops, and we could, we could pick a lot of cotton.  At twelve years old, I could pick 200 pounds of cotton.  And I was imitating my older sister. Well, that was, that earned us a reputation with the farmers because they, they liked to hire us as field workers, field hands to gather their, gather their crops.  And, but my younger sister got off from going, doing that kind of work because she didn't, she didn't care for it too much.  And she could get away with it whereas my mother would make us go to work.  So my younger sister was--later, though she turned out to be the one with the great sense of humor.  And she could tease her way, laugh her way out of anything.  And she was the first to get married too.  She, of the three of us.  She went--my older sister went away to college at Dillard University.  And I went the next year to Clark College in Atlanta, Georgia, and about two or three years later, my younger sister went to Fiske [University].  And she dropped out of Fiske and got married.  So, and we went, we kept going.
Story_ID: 20511
Speaker 1: Okay, well, I'm gonna catch up with that, but we always ask this question, describe where you grew up and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up? I The sights, sounds and smells from growing up.  Okay, I, just to roll back a little, there in Pavo [Georgia], when we were together as a family and with my mother [Ola Mae Watts Clark] and father [Willie B. Clark] and my two sisters and I, and sometimes there was, there was a relative living with us too, you know.  But the sight was, it--the smell was that of a farm place.  You know, you could smell either manure, pine trees or tar or--and the sound was that of a dog barking (laughter) outside.  And the, it would rain quite a bit in certain seasons of the year.  And then you'd have the wet mud around the house.  That was the, that was the--because this was, this was really country, wooded house in sort of a forestry like area.
Speaker 2: So this is like Southern Georgia too and near Florida and then near Northern Florida?
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: Okay, so the temperature is warm most of the time.
Speaker 1: That's right, temperature is warm, and the grass was sort of that tough Bermuda grass, that you see a lot of down in Belle Glade, around Belle Glade [Florida].
Speaker 2: Now, were you all near the coast or near, or more further inland?
Speaker 1: We were a little further in, but about sixty or seventy miles from Tallahassee, Florida.  So it was close to the coast.  It was about 225 miles South of Atlanta [Georgia].  And then you would have Tifton and Quitman (ph.) and Valdosta [Georgia] and Jacksonville.  So you're really going near the coast there. But it was fertile, pretty fertile farmland.  And now, the smell changed with the season.  Come summertime, oh, you would, you could feel the green tobacco getting ready to be, where you--you planted the tobacco and then it grew up and it was ready to be harvested.  And that was our main field work, going out to harvest tobacco.  And, you know, have you--I don't know whether you have the picture of how that's done.  It's, the men would go to the field and crop the tobacco and put it on a sled and the mules would bring the sled to the barn.  And then the women would put the tobacco on, string the tobacco on sticks, and those sticks then would be put in a barn in rows.  And it would be cooked.  So that season of the year, the smell was tobacco barns cooking the tobacco because you would fire them up and heat them and dry it out.
Story_ID: 20512
Speaker 1: I don't know as much about it myself, but I think tobacco leaves are pretty big, tough leaves, right?
Speaker 2: That's right, green leaves.  But if you were the tobacco stringer, and I was, I was quite a good tobacco stringer, and you would be positioned to string the tobacco.  And then you would have handers.  The handers would be on each side of the stick, and then you would take a hand from that side.  Then you would take a hand from this side.  There was a technique to it.  And you would have a rhythm, and if you were a tobacco stringer, you could do that real fast.  You got a dollar more if you were a stringer.  A hander simply got $3.00 per day.  A stringer earned $4.00 per day and if you were fast, if you were really fast, you could have three handers handing it to you and you would earn $5.00 a day.  But typically, a stringer, tobacco stringer is sort of like the, a short stop on a baseball team (laughter) or the pitcher or the catcher.  Some players are more valuable than others.  A tobacco stringer was in great demand, a good stringer.  But a characteristic of gathering, of tobacco processing like that, the tar sticks on your hand.  And at the end of the day, your hands would be tarry and yellow.  And you would need turpentine to get it off.  And, so you said, what did it smell like?  Oh, it depends on the season.  And when cotton picking season, when you were gathering the cotton.  Oh, you were going to the field early morning.  You got up at 4:00 a.m. in the morning and get the truck to go to the cotton field.  And you start picking the cotton while there was a dew on it.  It was heavier.  But midday that sun would be steaming hot.  And then it would smell differently, dry.  And you wanted it to be dry because if a shower came, then you stop.  But the cotton would be damp and it would sloppy and muddy, and messy.  Then you, there you got $3.00 per hundred pounds for picking it, and if you were, could pick 200 pounds per day, you would earn $6.00.  But that was early morning to night, to dawn, so that was quite a--that was very laborious, that was, well, hard work.  That's all you could say.  It was hard work.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I read in our research that you said that you could earn more money picking 200 pounds of cotton than you could working in somebody's home or something--
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: --in the course of a day.
Speaker 2: And so, to have the children go to the field and work, do field work, if the children were good, it could be a good supplement to the family's income.
Speaker 1: So that's one way to make an income too if you're in that sharecropping situation.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Now, when my mother [Ola Mae Watts Clark] and father [Willie B. Clark] separated, my mother would keep her day job as the maid, and she would let us go to help on the farm, her friends, people she knew.  And by that time, we had moved to Moultrie, Georgia.  We lived in town.  But I'm intrigued by the question, what did it smell like?  Then, it smelled differently at different seasons of the year.  The drudgery came from having such limited options.  That's where the drudgery in your mind came from, having those limited options and, now, that will bring us to why there was such eagerness to get an education.  You know, you--
Story_ID: 20513
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, let's talk about school.  Now, what was the--did you go to school in--that was in the other city, right?  You had to go to another town to go to school?
Speaker 2: No, the beginning.  I, my beginning of school was there at Pavo, Pavo, Georgia.  My mother's [Ola Mae Watts Clark] family and my father's [Willie B. Clark] family all went to a church in Pavo called Mount Zion Baptist Church [Georgia].  Mount Zion Baptist Church was the church for the black community, and it was the school for the black community, for black people.  Schools were staunchly segregated and about everything else in South Georgia.
Speaker 1: Now, did the school have a separate name other than the Mount Zion School or did they call it--
Speaker 2: No, it was Mount Zion, the school, Mount Zion Baptist Church School.  I mean it was a public school sponsored by the, by the state, but it wasn't a church school like a charter school, like we have today.  It was a public school.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, these are in the days of segregation, and did they spend as much money on-- I suppose, well, the State of Georgia didn't supply you with a school, right?
Speaker 2: No, no, that's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: But they paid the teachers?
Speaker 2: They paid the teacher, and--
Speaker 1: And supplies and that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they paid the teachers, but meager supplies.  It's just like separate and unequal, you know, that principle applied then.  That's just the way it worked.  We would go--did we have a school bus?  How did we get there, well, because we were dispersed on our, in our homes.  We would be, we would be taken to school at this Mount Zion Baptist Church.  And we had there--all seven grades were taught in that one room, the church sanctuary, all seven grades.  This was a country school for blacks.  And the teacher, her name was Ms. Florence Frazier, F-R-A-Z-I-E-R.  She, her home was Thomasville, Georgia, but she would come out to our community and live with a family for, during the weekdays and teach at the school, and teach us.  So she, she would room, roomed with a family, and that was what it was called, "taking up residence".  She would room with the family.  And so I started first grade at four years old in that school in about 1942.  That was my first school, elementary school.  She--and my older sister had started first grade the year before.
Speaker 1: So, let's just highlight this for whoever is listening to this.  You're starting first grade at four years old--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --not kindergarten--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: --and not preschool.
Speaker 2: No, we didn't have anything so fancy in our vocabulary as those differentiations of kindergarten and preschool.  And frankly, I'm a tell you why I started so soon.  I remember clearly that I was seeing--my mother needed to go to the field.  And my, I think I went to school so soon because I was going along with my older sister.  I wanted to go with her.  And our school wasn't so formal that Ms. Frazier wouldn't let the younger children just come.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I started first grade at four.
Speaker 1: Okay, we have to pause here again for another little break.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 20514
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so you start at four years old, and--
Speaker 2: Yes, and this, in this, at Mount Zion Baptist Church [Georgia] which was my school.  And we look forward to seven grades going, you know, finishing the seven grades in that one-room school house taught by the same teacher.  But Ms. Frazier was remarkable because she would have the smart students, she would teach them how to help the other students.  So she could have a lot teaching activity going on, where she's working with one group of students, and she would have my sister and myself teaching our fellow classmates how to do certain exercises.  For example, learning your ABC's, I can remember in the cotton field, being in the cotton field and writing my ABC's in the sand practicing.  I can remember that vividly.  And if you were an eager or diligent student, that's a good way to practice.  And learning, back in those days, learning your ABC's and your multiplication tables, that was something.  That was a goal to work for.  So, if you were, if you knew yours, you could pair up with one of the other children and practice, and say let's practice.  And you could help the others.  But Ms. Frazier lived in the community during the week days.  And she would talk about, with the community people, the children who were smart in school.  So the word got out that my sister and I were smart in school.  And that made our parents [Ola Mae Watts and Willie B. Clark] proud.  So on the question--and that caused them to have the aspiration, I think, a strong aspiration for us to get an education, though the opportunities had missed them or they did not--frankly, there was something that as a distraction to young women, that our expectation that you would be finding a husband too, you know.  So you would choose education or getting married.  But our parents had the aspiration for us to get an education.  And with Ms. Frazier taking the interest in us that she did, that helped our cause toward getting--and the community people too.  You see, on Sunday, you would come to church and, or you would be in church school.  And people would talk about, oh, I hear, honey, you have a brain on your head.  Use your head.  That kind of encouragement and motivation was beneficial to us and my family.  Now, that motivation, some of it missed my younger sister.  She did well enough, but she did not have the ambition that my older sister and I had.  But I'll be honest with you.  I think I was keeping up with my older sister too because we were, we were quite close.  No, Ms. Frazier, this woman continued to follow us, my sister and me, our progress through other people over the years, even after we moved out of that community.  I moved first.  We went to Mount Zion Baptist Church for school for several years.  But then I was sent to live with my grandmother.  You know, I mentioned that when she got her own house--that's skipping ahead.
Story_ID: 20515
Speaker 1: What happened to your parents' relationship?  Do you have any idea?  They split up when you were about seven or eight?
Speaker 2: Seven or eight.  Yeah, I know.  It's a, I told you my father [Willie B. Clark] had the drinking problem.  And there was the spousal abuse, get drunk, beat my mother [Ola Mae Watts Clark]--
Speaker 1: So his personality would change when he drank.
Speaker 2: Yeah, personality would change.  And, and the frustration of not having money and not having--frustrations that come from being unfulfilled man, you know, not having the money.  I think, because I can remember--and the reason I think that finances and that arguments over how you would use the money you have, probably was a factor, drink it up or use it for the family.  I can remember when gas was rationed in World War II [1939-1945].  See, this was all in the '40s [1940s], the War was on.  And the women in the family would be arguing, we need to save the gas and use these stamps, these gas stamps to go to the grocery men.  And the men would be arguing, use the gas stamps to go out and have a good time.  Arguments around how you were going to use the stamps for sugar.  See sugar was rationed just like gas.  Those, there were lots of family arguments, and I think spousal abuse.  And women were beat, beaten, you know.  I can, and I remember my mother and father started arguing, and we children would start crying and we would just be fearful.  And I think--I went to live with my grandmother because I was sort of assigned the child to do that so she wouldn't be living alone and--
Speaker 1: So did your oldest sister stay there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my oldest sister and youngest sister--
Speaker 1: She stayed with your mother?
Speaker 2: --stayed.  And when I knew, learned later, the news was Preacher and Ola had broker up, you know.  So, I--that's the way I got the news.
Speaker 1: So, you were away from home when they broke up?
Speaker 2: I was away from home by then, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then, though, my mother eventually came and got me--no, she came, she left Mamie and Dorothy, my younger, my sisters to live--all three of us lived with my grandmother for just a brief period of time, while my mother went up North to work and to earn money in the New Jersey area around Trenton and Camden, New Jersey.  She went and lived my grandmother's sister.  She had a sister up there named Lessie (ph.) who would have relatives come and stay with her and get situated.  And maids could earn more money up there.  And my mother would send money back home, to--back to my grandmother to help take care of us.  And I remember clearly how my grandmother would meet the mailman, you know, and my mother was very diligent.  She was very diligent about caring for us and, and helping my grandmother with the expenses.  And then later she, she returned from New Jersey.  We called it "Up North", and she would, she got us, got my older sister and younger sister situated in a small town called Funston, Georgia, Funston.  She went from Merrillville [Georgia] to Funston because she found a job.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Funston?
Speaker 2: F-U-N-S-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's a small town near Moultrie [Georgia].  And my mother, my sister was, was in elementary school then, still in elementary, my older sister, and then I stayed.  And I was going to school in Coolidge [Georgia], that was near my grandmother.  And eventually, though, my mother brought me to live with them, and she kept doing maid work.  And my older sister started school in Moultrie.  We all got situated in the town of Moultrie where we went to high school.  But for quite a while there, she, we were transient, going from place to place with, in a single-family household.
Story_ID: 20516
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did you, did that--how did that effect you and did it affect your schooling at all or did it affect how you felt?
Speaker 2: No, amazingly, my--well, naturally, you feel for your parents [Ola Mae Watts and Willie B. Clark] 'cause you could see your mother with the responsibility.  And I, what I witnessed there, though, with my older sister sort of became a companion or a sister to my mother.  For example, when a bill collector would come to the door, my mother would have my older sister go to the door and say I don't have the money, don't have the money, insurance people.  That was a very common thing.  But the neighborhood people, even around Funston and Moultrie, particularly the church people, took a special interest in us and, and would report to my mother how good we were in school.  The teachers, I think that was the trick.  I remember one year when the, a minister who taught in a country school out in Funston, took, would drive, take my, me and my younger sister--I was still in elementary school, with them.  And we registered in school out there.  And I kept the schooling going.  And my oldest sister started high school in Moultrie [Georgia] a year sooner than I did.  And she came home talking about those fancy people.  I won't forget at all her talking about the fancy people, the Home Economics teachers, and you know, Home Economics teachers would take a special interest in girls.  And they taught you how to cook.  They taught you how to sew.  And my older sister was taken aback by the, those fancy people.  So, and then we joined a church in Moultrie called Mother Easter Baptist Church [Georgia].  And that's another anchor point for us, Mother Easter Baptist Church.  And--
Speaker 1: Now, was it named after somebody?  It sounds like it's named for someone that, named Easter?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  No, Mother Easter, it sounds like it was, but I don't know whether that was the mother of the church, which was a, you know, real significant position in a Baptist church, the Southern or not.  But it was the Mother Easter Baptist Church, and we met two women there in Sunday school that took a--one named Marie Jackson and the other one's name was Savannah Williams.  They took a very special interest in us, and they taught us, us girls how to take care of ourselves.  And they were--my, my oldest sister met them first.  And my mother trusted us, trusted them to take care of us and the counselors.  But at the same time, my mother was, had gotten to be self conscious about her dress and her clothes.  She was a nice looking woman, but she was not educated.  And these people seemed educated.  As a matter of fact, both were school teachers.  And my mother was quite self conscious about her not having an education.  And she, so she, she would have us go to the school conferences and the school programs, but she wouldn't wanna come.
Story_ID: 20517
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: That was, so that split was there in the family.  Yet, she was very proud of us because everybody would give her reports about what good students we were, how well behaved we were.  And, but then we started singing in the choir at church, at the Mother Easter Baptist Church.  And we met a pianist, a Ms. Bridges who played for the church choir, for us, and the choir director was a school teacher.  He was the English teacher in the high school there.  And then that's where we met up with the principal of the high school, George W. Parker, who had attended Dillard University in New Orleans.  And Dillard University--Mr. Parker was high school principal in Moultrie, Georgia of the black, for the black school, Moultrie High School for Negro Youth.  That's the name (laughter), that was the name of the school.  And so as my, when my sister--Mr. Parker influenced my sister to try to go to Dillard University because they had a Bachelors in Nursing program.  And eventually, she chose to go to Dillard University.  And so it was--
Speaker 1: So, she's going to college.  She not only graduates from high school, but she's going to college.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, after she met Mr. Parker, she, she started college, eventually started college at Dillard.  And the next year, mainly because of the influence of the college recruiter from Atlanta, from Clark College in Atlanta, I got a scholarship to go to Clark College in Atlanta, Georgia.

Speaker 1: Okay, now, we get you out of high school, kind of describe high school for us and what were--I mean, so was this high school like a regional, the Moultrie High School?  Did people come from all around Moultrie [Georgia] to it?
Speaker 2: Yes, by--it was by bus.  But we could walk.  We were, we lived in town, and Moultrie High School [Georgia]--but it was a long walk.  We walked from across town, and oh, it was about an hour walk to school one way.  And I, it was Moultrie High School for Negro Youth.  That's on my high school diploma.  And it was, they had a band.  They had a good football team.  It was well known, and it was, it was in Moultrie, but it just--it serviced the county as well, you know, the people came in and attended there even if they lived, you know, from the rural community.  And--
Speaker 1: So in those days too, your team would play other black schools, high schools in the area?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's right, Fort Valley, yeah, Fort Valley, Altman and Thomasville.  These were rival teams.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause they couldn't play though--the white schools didn't play the black schools.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  This was separate.  And I knew the football coach well, the band director, and at first, I started--I always had a job after school to help my mom [Ola Mae Watts Clark] with the expenses.  For example, after I got out of school, I would go in to work for, clean house for two hours.  I would get on my bicycle and go clean house for two hours for a lady.  Or after my mother remarried--well, when she remarried, she married a man who made brooms in a mop factory, brooms and mops.  And I would work in that factory, painting broom handles, I remember, to earn money to help out at home.  The other--connected with that, the other job that we would do is, in a certain kind of season of the year, we would stay out of school and go chop cotton.  So at times, if there was day work to be done on a farm, and we could get the work, we would miss school and just go to the field, earn money that day.  Typically, you could earn $3.00 a day.  Now, we--parents, I would say my mother knew we could catch up and keep up with our school work.  So she didn't think that was too bad, you know, for us to miss school every now and then to go to the field to earn money if there was a work opportunity.
Speaker 1: Now, that wasn't an exception, I mean for you and your sister to do that?
Speaker 2: It wasn't what?
Speaker 1: An exception.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --'Cause a lot of students probably were doing--
Speaker 2: But, it was, it wasn't too much of an exception.  It, it became an exception for us because these were families, white families my mother trusted us with.  They would come and pick us up and--but it's interesting.  Their children would be going to school.  See, you would, the black children would be going out there working for them.  Their children would not be kept out of school.
Story_ID: 20519
Speaker 1: I know I've heard that some black communities had shorter school years than the white schools, I mean they would only go to school certain when there was nothing to be done in the fields.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, no.  We, our system wasn't that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Moultrie [Georgia] had a population of 25,000 then.  And the population has since dwindled to 17,000.  So Moultrie was the county seat for Colquitt County [Georgia].  And it was a little more progressive than those schools, than those systems that would do something like that.  No, it was family choice that that happened to us to make ends meet, to cover the bills.  The, I heard my mother [Ola Mae Watts Clark] say a number of times that, what she was most proud of was ability to put food on the table.  She really agonized over, about not having enough food to eat.  And sometimes, the families we helped would send her back peas and beans and share stuff that they had raised, that they were raising on the farm, tomatoes.  We called those crops, truck crops, we called them, and okra, greens.  She loved getting these contributions because it helped to make ends meet.  And she was pretty frugal, but that was the help.  But she actually worried about not having enough to eat.  And, and you couldn't often, you couldn't see her worries.  Well, there's much more to this story about her caring for herself and her not getting her healthcare, healthcare that she needed because of not having the money, some painful stories there during this time.
Story_ID: 20520
Speaker 1: Other than teachers, were there any other black professionals in town other than teachers and preachers?  Were there, was there a doctor or a lawyer or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, we did not have a black doctor.  And I remember after I got to college, there was a black physician who came to town.  And that was big news.  That was, that was big news.  I think there was an insurance man.  Our choir teacher, choir musician was an insurance person, and--her husband, her husband, Mr. Bridges.  He wrote insurance.  And he was considered one of the more educated people too, you know.  There was, certain professional types, we assumed that they were educated.  They were the educated ones compared to the other people in town.  And there might have been a black nurse's aid out at the hospital, but the hospital was in the white part of town and we didn't get over to the white part of town unless you were doing maid work, you went over.  I went over to clean house.  I had a job for people in the white part of town, but if you wasn't doing maid work, you didn't go to that part of, section of town.  You, the--because it was segregated.
Story_ID: 20521
Speaker 1: Now, what was the information flow like?  Did you get magazines and newspapers at home or did you have a radio or--
Speaker 2: A radio, yes.  I remember living with my grandmother and getting the radio.  And your other news came through the mailman, you know, when you got a letter from a relative.  And then, it was, your other information was word-of-mouth in the church.  And unfortunately, these were rumors, rumors of somebody was picked up, put in jail.  There were rumors around how to protect yourself or somebody was accused of saying something unbecoming to a white woman.  And they were being--they left town or they were, they feared something was gonna happen to the--rumors like that, that was, that would scare the community.  That was, but I tell you what did happen.  When we lived around Pavo [Georgia], I don't know how they got there, but the 'Pittsburgh Courier', the black newspaper out of Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], I remember seeing that lying around our house.  And it was quite a, quite exciting to glance that and hear about what black people were doing.  And that paper got spread all the way, a lot in the South, and especially, it was prominent in, during my high school years and during Black History Month, you would see all these stories about Cab Calloway and oh, the Louie Armstrong and all of these--and George Washington Carver and Tuskegee and all the black history figures.  That, but the 'Pittsburgh Courier' was a pinkish color paper, and I can see it now in the house.  And I went to a conference in Pittsburgh for the Council on Foundations a few years back.  And I went looking for it, and I found the--I asked around and found that the paper was, the archives had been turned over to a museum.  And they were ordering them, putting them in order.  And so they have revived the memory.  I think it's still going on in some other format though.
Speaker 1: No, it's still the 'Courier', yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that paper, that's an old paper, and it was sort of the, a source of hope for us, like a Beacon.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't have the scope it used to have.  It was the most widely-distributed black paper in the country.
Speaker 2: Well, it found its way South to South Georgia.
Speaker 1: That and the 'Chicago Defender', yeah, those were the two.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Oh, it was--that was for us, for young blacks like ourselves that had dreams, and that were dreaming possibilities of a better life or that were trying to vision better opportunities for yourself than your parents had, that was, that was powerful.
Story_ID: 20522
Speaker 1: Now, you as a high school student, I mean what--you made good grades.  Now, we've established that, but were you involved in school activities?  Did you take a leadership role in school?  What were people saying about you in high school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, we--I attempted to.  I participated in student government.  And I was the high school queen for--I was runner-up.  I was part of the Queen's court.  I was a runner up.  And my good friend, Osa Belle Jackson, who lives in Atlanta [Georgia] now, was the Queen.  Osa Belle was a year behind me, I remember.  She was, she's younger.  And, but I was the, I was selected by my schoolmates to be a candidate for the Queen.  "Ms. Moultrie High", that's what we called it there.  And I also started to play in the band.  I started to play the clarinet.  But I had to go to work after school.  I couldn't go for practices.  That was the problem there.  And I was in the Home Economics Club.  You know, we had that kind of club.  And, but we, I had to give priority to going to work and so did my sister.  But these extracurricular activities, they were, they were sort of helpful, helped you develop some social skills.  Most of my extracurricular activities revolved around the church though.  I remember going to a church camp for about a week one summer.  Maybe it was two weeks.  It wasn't that long though.  And that's where I learned that bible verse I told, when you said, what is your favorite quote?  I quoted second Timothy, 2:15.  I learned that in that church camp, many, many years ago when I was just a young child.  And so that was, that could be considered an extracurricular activity.
Speaker 1: Now, what about Science, you know, what about Science?  When did, when was your first exposure to Science?
Speaker 2: My first exposure to Science, actually, in a formal way came in high school, and we had sort of a laboratory course, lab, not very sophisticated though and nothing like what I found at Clark [College].  And I encountered that in high school.  I would say my first aspiration for Science, the study of science started in the first grade in four years, you know, when I was four years old and starting out schooling in the formal sense and discovering that I could--I was such a good student.  That wet my appetite for wanting more and more education and also my love for numbers, you know, mathematics.  And you can just call it arithmetic at that time.  It was about, oh, I would say when I got in what would be the late elementary school level, when we--and kind of Black History Month, discovered George Washington Carver, learned about a black man who was a scientist and that he was a chemist.  And you start learning about other things black people were doing.  And that's why the 'Pittsburgh Courier' was so significant.  And, but that, learning about that scientist was quite an enlightenment to me.  But then real science, my introduction to real science came when I was a freshman at Clark College [Atlanta, Georgia].  And when I went to college, I went there to be a Home Economics teacher.  Okay, I'll stop there.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, we can pause here.
Story_ID: 20523
Speaker 1: Okay, so in high school, you had a basic education, but not really a specific, no specific biology or chemistry or--
Speaker 2: No, no, not a memorable science experience.
Speaker 1: Now, how high did they go in mathematics in high school?
Speaker 2: Oh, algebra, I think it was, multiplication table, algebra.  I think we might have gotten to algebra, geometry.  I don't know, maybe we got that--I knew triangles and figures by then.  So it was, high school math.  It wasn't very sophisticated.  But it was enough to get you ready for college, you know, qualify for college.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you went to--so how did you wind up going to Clark [College]?  Who advised you about Clark?
Speaker 2: I had somehow heard about Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia], and by the time I got to high school--I believe it was through Black History Month that I learned about Hampton University.  I had my sights set on going to Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia].  And then they, the Dean of Students at Clark College [renamed to Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta, Georgia] would come to my high school to recruit students for college.  And he would answer a lot of questions about what the college experience was like, and he was hoping that good students would come to Clark [Clark Atlanta University].  And that's when doctor, when our high school principal told me about Clark, the colleges in Atlanta [Georgia].  And I listened to Dean Harold Hamilton, that was his name, the Dean of Students, Harold Hamilton.  And I think his first name was Harold.  I know he had a nephew named Harold also.  But anyway, his last name was Hamilton.  He was the Dean of Students and also the recruiter.  I told him about my financial needs, and he said that I--he would, I could apply for a scholarship with Clark, and he would try to get a job for me.  And he did arrange for me to work in the registrar's office.  And so that's how I got to Clark.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you were a Valedictorian of Moultrie [Moultrie High School For Negro Youth]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was.
Speaker 1: I'm just seeing this here on the on note.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was the Valedictorian and my sister was Valedictorian.  There was no question that I would excel in my studies.  That was--and I, I had the ability to master any subject I set my mind to.  But I, and I enjoyed studying my subjects.  I enjoyed being studious.  So I was, I would say I'm pretty much a born student, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: --even to this day.
Story_ID: 20524
Speaker 1: Now, how did you--what was, well, how did you like Clark [College] initially?  I mean did you really like it?  I mean did it seem to be a good place for you?
Speaker 2: Yes, it--well, coming from the environment, the home environment I was in, and having, eager to see and to learn from those more sophisticated environments, I, I just fell in love with it right away.  But I had benefited from what my sister told me about Dillard [University].  See, she had been at Dillard for one year.  And she, when she got to Dillard, she would--and she would come home for the holidays.  She would tell us about that great place, the campus, the way it looked and all of those--the students and, and, oh, she just made it sound like she was, it was heaven compared to our poor country setting.  And, now, I had gone a high school tour.  They took us, some high school students on a bus up to Atlanta [Georgia].  Well, going to Atlanta was the thing that we lived for in South Georgia.  So Atlanta was the Mecca.  It was the big city.  So I had visited the big city of Atlanta and we had heard about these black colleges, and I'd heard about Clark, and, you know, the historical significance of those colleges.  And so when I got in the dormitory--I lived in the dormitory all four years, got--I was assigned a roommate.  And I got in the dormitory.  And I was introduced to the library, and we had a Dean of Women that was very sophisticated woman.  And the faculty persons there were quite conscious of the need for us to have role models and examples, to show us how to carry ourselves.  That was the language they used.  So, and, oh, we had chapel every day.  Chapel and to find that marvelous course, you know, the Philharmonic Society was the equivalent of the college course.  And we had just--so I was given my subjects, you know, to take and I took to them and became very studious.  I loved it, I really loved it.  But it was an adjustment for me because I remember going, getting on the Trailways Bus in Moultrie [Georgia]--this was September, with my footlocker.  You know, every--we had those footlockers where we took our clothes.  Then we had been told to come to the bus station on Spring Street in Atlanta.  The ticket was $4.35, so I bought that, one way.  And my, I got there and got a cab over to the campus.  And I, I was pretty good at following instructions.  All right, got on the bus.  I went to the back of the bus as instructed, you know, you--it was segregated then.  And the bus stopped in Albany [New York], and then it stopped in Americus [Georgia], and then, then it went quite a distance before we made another stop just outside of Atlanta.  But it was a memorable experience and later, my mother [Ola Mae Watts Clark] came up to visit me.  And, oh, she loved the way people treated her.  She was quite self-conscious about not being educated.  She loved the way people treated her.  I remember her having some kind of meal, like a banquet in the Home Economics Department.  And she loved the food.  What struck me as unique in my setting, to have three meals a day in the cafeteria at Clark.  You see, to have regular meals and have a nice dormitory setting, and I'd never been in anything that fancy.  To me, it was fancy compared to my home environment.  And I didn't have anything to complain about, and I couldn't understand why some of the students just complained all the time.  But they were used to fancier things at home.  There was--and, oh, to meet students from Florida and from Memphis, Tennessee, from Chattanooga [Tennessee], and to hear them complain, "I don't want that food", "I don't want this", I loved it (laughter).  I loved it because that was, that was a comfort that I wasn't accustomed to.  But I adapted well to my supervisor in the Registrar's office.  I worked in the Registrar's office four years at Clark, twelve hours a week for $0.35 an hour.  And that was to supplement my, my income to get along there.
Story_ID: 20525
Speaker 1: Now, how did you--I mean I guess you could have done almost anything, you know, academically at that point, but how did you--what drew you to chemistry?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, that's a special story.  I went to Clark [College] thinking I was gonna major in Home Economics and then, and graduate with a major in Home Economics and become a teacher, high school teacher, go back home and work in the local high school.  But the Home Economics major required a year of freshman chemistry, a year of chemistry.  And you completed that in your freshman year.  And I took that, once I got in the chemistry court, I fell in love with the lab part of it.  And then I went through the first semester of chemistry for that major, and then by the time I was in the second semester, Dr. Alfred Spriggs, who was a new faculty member at Clark, and who came there to be chair of the Department of Chemistry.  The second semester, Dr. Spriggs had, right away connected with us students.  And he started telling us about what we could do, the field of Chemistry, what we could do with it.  And I told him, I--you know, he noticed how much I liked Chemistry.  So he told us you could be a research chemist if you majored in chemistry.  And, but you would have to go to graduate school, and then you would--so naturally, I was on my way to becoming a Home Economics teacher.  And I decided to be a, to change my major to, to major in chemistry.  So it was that, what you might call, "I came to the crossroads" after I met Dr. Spriggs and got that mentoring and that advising.  And I then changed my major to be a chemist.
Speaker 1: Now, were there any other young black women in Chemistry?
Speaker 2: Yes, there was, in the chemistry course.  There was one called Alberta Ferguson.  That was her name.  Alberta was from Americus, Georgia.  And she became a chemistry major, and then there was the gentleman, he's in the picture, Avon Kirkland.  Avon became a chemistry major.  So it was--and I'm sure there were some others.  But we went through the four years together, and so they stand out.
Speaker 1: Okay, but was it unusual for a female to be a chemistry major?
Speaker 2: It was, it was unusual for a female to be a chemistry major.  And, but not with Dr. Spriggs.  Dr. Spriggs, our professor, was gender neutral, I would say.
Story_ID: 20526
Speaker 1: Now, what was Dr. Spriggs' background.  Where did he go to school and where did he come from?
Speaker 2: Okay, Dr. Spriggs was--where was he from?  He had some sisters.  Dr. Spriggs had graduated himself from Washington University in St. Louis.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's where he got his, I believe, his doctorate degree.  And I think he had worked for a little while in the past at Tennessee State or another historically black college.  And he was, but those two things I remember pretty much about him.  And I believe, family wise, that he had a sister, had some sisters.  He did have a family there in Atlanta [Georgia].  And when he died, I went down and said some words at his funeral, and his wife, Mozella, I believe she's still--and his children, they're still in Atlanta.  We had another professor in chemistry named Booker T. Simpson.  His name is on one of those pictures.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Mr. Simpson was another person who encouraged us to be good in the sciences and encouraged women.  Now, it's interesting how the--well, we didn't have any women chemistry professors.  So the mentoring we got, the encouragement had to come from, you know, the men.  And we mentioned the name Dr. McBay.  There were others who--if you were a good student, those professors seemed to be gender neutral.  They were, they--if you were a good student, man or a woman, they would encourage you, and they seemed not to have any biases about the women studying chemistry, studying the sciences.  It's just whether you could do the subject matter.  And they were demanding.  They were demanding and they made it a challenge.  And I think that's one of the things that appealed to me, the fact that it was a challenging subject matter, taxing.  But I loved the lab, and I remember one of my very first experiments, testing the acidity of something with litmus paper, and you see yourself, you see the color changes the litmus paper depending on whether it was acidic or basic.  And then, but working the problems in the book was a, was a challenge, and that was, made it appealing to me.  I liked the, the challenging subject matter.  But I had no difficulty with any subject.  It's just a matter of what I found most interesting.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, it says here that you were terrified of Dr. McBay--no, not you.  It's somebody else, but John Hall, I think, says that he was terrified of Dr. McBay.
Speaker 2: John Hall, John Hall said that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was Dr. McBay terrifying?
Speaker 2: I didn't find him terrifying.  Eventually, later in my chemistry studies, I took a course from Dr. McBay at the University--called Physical Chemistry.  I was a good student.  Dr., Dr. McBay found any good student appealing.  I think he was, he wasn't lenient on you, but what he wanted most was the students to work hard and to do a good job.  And if you didn't, he had no--I don't think he would be reluctant at all to advise you out of chemistry.  He never thought of that with me, and one reason I went to the University of Chicago is because he, he graduated from the University of Chicago.  No, I had no difficulty with Dr. McBay.  He was, he--I think the word got around to all of them about my financial difficulties and humble circumstances and that I couldn't afford to waste time.  And they admired that, they did, I think they really did.
Story_ID: 20527
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in the summers, you would go to Poughkeepsie, New York and clean homes?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Pauling, New York, that's right.  The Dean of Women at Clark [College] found those jobs for students who would agree to take them, maid jobs.  I was called into the Dean's office, Dean Birney, Birney was her name, Phoebe Bernie.  P-H-O-E-B-E, or something like that Birney, B-I-R-N-E-Y or something.  And she knew that I was looking for a summer job, summer work.  The option was to go back to the field.  But she, she said that some women in New York were seeking students to come and serve, work in their homes for the summer.  And I talked with my mother and said that I would be willing to go.  So I would, she paired me up with a family called the Dann Family, D-A-N-N.  And I would take the train from Atlanta [Georgia] in May, in May to Penn Station in New York.  And I would be picked up there by, I was picked up by a lady named Mrs. Calder, C-A-L-D-E-R, the first summer and driven up to Pauling, New York where I met the Dann family.  And that first summer, I was to take care of their little, five-year old son, Harvey (laughter).  I was going to be the babysitter.  And the next summer I advanced to being the, the cook, the cook for the family.  And so, and I went, I went up North, there in New York, and worked as a live-in maid four summers, even the summer after senior year.  So I was--that became sort of my standard summer job.  And I, I could save every penny 'cause I earned $25.00 a week, and I had Thursdays off, and I could put all of that in the bank.  And I went sightseeing on Thursday in New York City.  Mrs. Dann would help me plan out the day.  And I would, so I got to know the city what it was like.
Speaker 1: Now, were the Dann's, did they have a connection with Clark in terms of expecting that they were gonna get a student, and they knew that that student needed, you know--did they expect to try to help you in some way or did they--or were they, they didn't really know who they were getting and didn't care.
Speaker 2: They didn't know who they were getting, but I think, I think they assumed they were getting a student who needed to earn the money.  And I didn't, I don't know whether they saw this as social responsibility or a giveback initiative on their part or not.  But they--Mr. Dann told me, said once, he greeted me.  He said, I'm so happy you're here because Lois has her hands full doing so much work with these three children, and she could really use your help.  They had three children, Harvey, little Harvey, was the five-year old, the youngest and the other two were in high school.  And Mary, the middle--she might have been in middle school, but little Harvey was a pistol.  He was the--and Mrs. Dann did the cooking and the house work, the cleaning, the usual things.  And he, Mr. Dann--Mr. Dann had a job in New York and he'd come home on weekends.  He was, had his own business, and they had an apartment in New York.  I think it was reassuring too for him to--for someone to be there with her.  But they had, it was a fancy area, a ritzy community.
Story_ID: 20528
Speaker 1: Did it have a name, I mean the--
Speaker 2: Quaker Hill [New York], Quaker Hill is the name of the community.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Edward R. Morrow and Norman Vincent Peale, quite a few famous names had homes out there, summer homes.  It was very educational to me.  Right next door to the Dann's house was a Quaker meeting house.  I never, being a Southern Baptist, black Baptist, I'd never heard of the Quakers and their big religious, how they did whatever they did, how they worshiped.  Mrs. Dann would inform me about all of that.  Then she would tell me about Dr. Peale's church in New York City, Norman Vincent Peale.  I knew his name, and I knew the name Edward R. Morrow, but I got to see his wife and their son and hear about his work, more about his work.  They were very down-to-earth people.  But that opportunity to go into New York City and see the big city and learn about the fancy places, Yankee Stadium, Metropolitan Opera house and the Rockefeller Centre, Empire State Building, to see the famous Penn, Penn Station, and the Chrysler Building, and to go on a Staten Island Ferry around the city, at seventeen years old, a young black from New York City--I mean from the South.  That was really--segregated South too.  That was eye opening.  So I would go back to Clark, as I was going through Clark, I was becoming more enlightened as to what other states might be like, other sophisticated experiences.
Speaker 1: Now, did you go to Harlem during those periods of time?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, I did.  She would, the day before I left, would write out what I would do over the period of the day, even when I would eat.  And then she would, she would tell me to--she sent me once to Fifth Avenue to see all the famous department stores, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdales, and the others.  And she said if I wanted to buy something she would give me her charge card.  She said, you could use my charge card.  She trusted me, and I didn't buy anything.  And, but she was--oh, and New York Public Library that she would--she would, she was just that conscious of helping me learn, helping me learn.  So, and I would follow her instructions.  That was courageous on my part because, you know, I could have been fearful.  But there, we didn't have telephones.  We didn't have a lot of other distractions.  We didn't have the cell phone, you know, or computers, very simple things.  And, oh, when she would go to the library to get a book for the children, she would take me too.  And, you know, I was learning some habits there, but I hadn't practiced in Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was an enriching experience.

Speaker 1: Now, you were--also back at Clark, you were elected the queen, homecoming Queen, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was, back then.  You want me to describe that experience?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: That was quite an unusual experience.  I was ambivalent about the whole thing, but you were the court football's queen--you were the football team's queen, I mean the, you were Ms. Clark College for the whole students, but it was sort of a booster experience for your sports program too.  I was ambivalent about doing that because by that time my mother--
Speaker 1: Did they need your permission to run you for that position or did--how did you get selected?
Speaker 2: My, some friends encouraged, well, they--the question at the end of your junior year, every year is, who's going to be the college queen.  Who's gonna run?  Who's gonna be Ms. Clark?  People start speculating.  Oh, that person would be.  They want somebody with good character, good grades and who would just be a good role model.  And I didn't have the money, and besides that my mother needed surgery, terribly bad.  And my--so I didn't know.  This was at the end of my junior year 'cause my sister was still at Dillard [University].  And my sister joined the Army Nurse Corp, while she was at Dillard.  And that gave her about $200 a month, and she then decided, she made the decision for me.  And she said, if they're asking you to run for Ms. Clark, to be Ms. Clark, why don't you go ahead and run, and I'll help you buy your clothes.  And I'll pay the expenses.  And that was--and then there was a lady who worked in the Registrar's office, her name is Marietta, she said, I would--I will make your clothes.  So she made the gown.  She sewed, and I bought the hat, and she made another dress that I needed, and then I bought the shoes.  And that's the way we put things together.  And I was elected Ms. Clark.  And that was quite an honor.  It meant a lot to the campus.  The president--you had a coronation and the president crowned you.  And they, there were some runner-ups, these--your Court consisted of your people, other people who had run and not won.  And, but to have the Valedictorian also be Ms. Clark meant a lot to them.  And that was--I did that because people encouraged me to do it, but I was very ambivalent because of the need for the money.  By that time though, I was, I had decided to go to graduate school.  And I was applying for a fellowship for that.  And I got the fellowship, Woodrow Wilson Fellowship.  It paid all of my expenses to the University of Chicago that first year.  And so, things started coming together for me nicely.  My sister graduated--
Story_ID: 20530
Speaker 1: So what year is this when you graduate from--
Speaker 2: From Clark [College], '58 [1958].
Speaker 1: Yeah, '58 [1958].
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty eight [1958].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So that, it seems like I was seeing light at the end of the tunnel.  But I had some rough periods financially before then and with the special help and encouragement of the president of the college, James B. Brawley, the, my supervisor in the Registrar's office, Dr. Spriggs, my chemistry professor.  It was the encouragement of, and my high school principal, the encouragement of a lot of people that kept me going, I would say.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And certainly my older sister.
Speaker 1: So Dr. Brawley was president?
Speaker 2: Yeah, James P. Brawley, B-R-A-W-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, well, let's pause here a second.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 20531
Speaker 1: Was to get permission to take my exams.
Speaker 2: Okay.  We were talking about James P. Brawley, president of Clark [College].
Speaker 1: Clark, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you come to Chicago [Illinois] in the Fall of '58' [1958]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh-huh.  After I'd gone up to New York and worked as a maid for a Mrs. Stone, a lady named Mrs. Stone whom I lived with.  And she lived alone, and--a rich woman, very rich.  But I can't--I came onto the University of Chicago [Illinois] in September.
Speaker 2: Now, did you stay on campus or--
Speaker 1: Yes, I did, Beecher Hall.  I stayed, and I stayed on campus all of my graduate years at Chicago, about four and a half years, lived in a dormitory.
Speaker 2: Okay, now how did you like Chicago?  Now, you'd seen New York City, which is a little bit bigger, but what did you think of Chicago?
Speaker 1: I, it was, I liked Chicago [Illinois].  I liked the campus, you see.  I didn't get out of the city at all until about my third year that.  I would walk from the campus to Hyde Park [neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois].  I got around Hyde Park, but being in the dormitory, I didn't have need to go down on Michigan Avenue [a major street in Chicago, Illinois] and downtown to the, to what they called "off campus", to the off-campus things, go shopping downtown.  And besides that, I got, when I got there, I was 19 years old.  I was still young.  And I remember having a dorm mother who, who--I was still under supervision at that young age of the dorm.  It wasn't until 20, I got 20 that I had the full freedom, you know, to do things that a student would do, even though I was a graduate student.  It was a graduate student dorm.  What was different about Chicago though, and I felt it right away, and this was my biggest adjustment at first, it was September, came October and November, it started to get cold.  And I felt the cold, and I remember writing home and asking my mother to send me some Long Johns [long underwear].  It was the wind off the lake that really, I found a big adjustment.  And so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is the first time you've been in a cold city, I mean, you know, in the wintertime--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause you were in New York in the summer.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.  And the other memorable experience was, my--see, I was, I wasn't anxious or scared, but I was very concerned that I do well in my subjects.  And I remember the counseling session I had with my, the counselor that the chemistry department had assigned to me when I first got there.  My first meeting with him, his name was a Dr. Clements, C-L-E-M-E-N-T-S.  Another person that I was close to was a Dr. Parsons, P-A-R-S-O-N-S.  He was secretary of the chemistry department.  They were the ones who advised me on which courses to take for my chemistry major and work toward a doctorate degree.  And Dr. Clements gave me a very good advice, I can see it now.  He looked at the courses I had taken at Clark [College, Atlanta, Georgia], chemistry course, and particularly, he looked at physical chemistry, the last course in which I'd taken in my senior year.  And he looked at the textbook we had used, and it wasn't the most challenging textbook being used at that time.  Some textbooks were harder than others.  So Dr. Clements said to me, you know, at Clark, you were a big fish in a little pond.  You were Valedictorian, very good student, but I want you to know that here at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], you're gonna find a lot of Valedictorians in your freshman class from different places.  And so the competition is going to be stiff.  You're going to have a lot of good students here.  He said I would advise you--for that reason I would advise you to take the chemist--the physical chemistry course over and, because we use another textbook here.  And it was a textbook--I was familiar with the textbook.  It was called 'Moore', by someone named Moore, M-O-O-R-E.  And it was a harder textbook, but I took his advice.  And I made an 'A' in the course, and I think that gave me the confidence, that boosted my confidence.  But you didn't see any women faculty members, still.  You had male advisors, but I studied hard.  I met women friends in the dormitory.  I took out the cafeteria plan so I got the three meals a day on campus, though we had, in our dorm, we could cook.  We could shop and cook if we wanted to.  But, and I was, got to know other students, and I think being in the dormitory served me well.  But it's, so there were two things, two big adjustments, the weather and the, the wind, Chicago wind, and that getting to know the faculty and the advice from Dr. Clements.  And I took the advice because I was--and naturally people back home, you know, wanted to know how I was gonna do, Dr. Spriggs and Dr. McBay, but they were very proud.  And Dr. Mays, Benjamin Mays, because he graduated from the University of Chicago as well.  And so, you don't wanna let them down.  All along the way, you have people that you don't wanna let down.  And that was--and I was keeping in touch with my parents, and my sister, my older sister and, who was in the Army at that time, working as a nurse, though, and my father.  My father had moved to Belle Glade, Florida, and he worked on this sugarcane farm.  And I would write him.  Not being able to write, I didn't hear back from him, but I would hear from him through my aunt who was in touch with my mother.  And I did get to see my father when I was--I went down to Belle Glade on the bus once over time to see him.  And he was so happy, and he, he told me, he said, "Baby, I would write to you, I would ask somebody to write to you, but it's so hard to get people to write for you."  And he said, "For God's sake, I wouldn't put any money in an envelope to give them to send you because they'd keep it" (laughter).  There again, that cost of illiteracy, you know, the burden that you carry.  And I understood.  Now, my sisters didn't understand as easily as I did.  You know, they were not as forgiving as--but I was very forgiving.  And then when I got married some years later, I went down with my husband and our three-year old son, our little--our oldest son was three.
Story_ID: 20532
Speaker 1: Okay, so the work at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], it wasn't, I mean it wasn't like it was--it wasn't too challenging or anything for you after coming out of the--because of the connections, I guess that Dr. McBay and the rest of them had with the University of Chicago?
Speaker 2: No, it was, I would use the word, "rigorous".  You would, rigorous.  Besides that, in addition to that, that the work being, it was challenging for me, particularly in the--the next year, I took some, I took another set of courses that were less familiar.  Quantum Mechanics, for example, I remember that course.  Quantum Mechanics, that probably was my most difficult course.  And I might have gotten a 'C' and C-plus, but I remember that course being very, very difficult.  And, you see, you're with students who have been exposed to that sometimes back in their schools.  So you with--Dr. Clements was right.  You have another set of minds there with different kinds of backgrounds.
Speaker 1: Did you know Dr. Lester, William Lester?
Speaker 2: William Lester.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he graduated in '59' [1959].
Speaker 2: Graduated from the University of Chicago?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, he got a Master's Degree in Chemistry.
Speaker 2: In '59' [1959].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I believe I did know him because I got a Master's in '60 [1960].  I did get a Masters but I didn't do the thesis.  I think I did, I think I did.
Speaker 1: Well, he's out in California, the University of California, Berkeley [California].
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  But it was, for a woman too, you didn't have the circles, the networks.  I had a study group with a few students, but you don't have, you didn't have the circles and the networks that could be so beneficial when you come across a difficult problem or a difficult assignment, you know, to work on.  But I tell you who was helpful, this Dr. Parsons, the secretary of the department.  You could take any, any challenge to him.  He would--and talk with him about it.  He was very, a helpful gentleman.  Dr. McBay was, Dr. McBay was the person who just felt that you were capable.  He had confidence in you.  That's the thing that helped you so much.  They all had confidence in you.  And the other thing that helped me, I was still--I still have that habit of going to church, going to chapel.  Rockefeller Chapel [tallest building on the University of Chicago campus] there in terms of the quality of service and the choirs and the speakers, they, they don't come any better than that.  I enjoyed that experience.  I saw Martin Luther King, Jr. there.  He spoke there, and I remember sitting in the midst of history, but not knowing it, you know.  But I would go there.  I was very diligent about going to chapel and taking advantage of that.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember the year that Dr. King [Martin Luther King, Jr.] spoke?
Speaker 2: No, you know, I can look it up because I be they have all the speakers on the website now.  And it would have been between, I think it was about '60 [1960] or sixty--about 1960 because I went there in '58 [1958], and I graduated in '63 [1963].  So it was in that timeframe, probably about 1960.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went straight through for the Ph.D. and then you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did.
Speaker 1: --so you went straight through.
Speaker 2: I went from my freshman year at Clark [College] straight through to a doctorate degree.  I lived in a dormitory for eight years, four at Clark and four and a half at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  I didn't take a break there.  I just went full through.
Story_ID: 20533
Speaker 1: Okay, now, physical chemistry, now, some of the other chemists I've talked to, they seem to spend like all year in the chemistry department with test tubes and in the lab, and they hardly ever come out.  But you were spending like summers away from the campus and coming back and that sort of thing.  And did that, I mean when you were at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], did you spend like most of your time in the lab?
Speaker 2: Yes, as a matter of fact, while I was there, I only one summer--I took one summer off.  And I went to Washington [D.C.], thinking I would get a job.  And my sister lived in Washington by then, and I would get a job.  But, and I, I remember saying, I wanna go and sleep on her, you know.  So I went down and got a job typing in the government office building.  And I typed up these reports all summer on employment benefits for postmen, what they call, 'workers compensation', workers compensation reports for postmen, their injuries.  And I learned there that postmen get more dog bites than any other kind of injury, letter carriers.  And the people around didn't know that I was temporary, the ladies I was working for.  And they, I got along famously with them.  I was a good typist.  I did a good job, and when I told 'em I was going back to school in September, they were very disappointed.  But that was the only summer that I took off, and otherwise, I would go about eleven months out of the year, eleven to twelve months.
Story_ID: 20534
Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell us about your dissertation and what was your dissertation about?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my dissertation was on the heater formation, the thermochemistry of laves phases, L-A-V-E-S.  Laves phases are intermetallic compounds and between--and I studied the one formed between magnesium zinc, magnesium copper, magnesium and nickel.  And I did my dissertation in the department of chemistry but also in the department, in the Institute for the Study of Metals.  So my focus was on pretty much material science, alloys or, and special, special kinds of materials.  I learned a world of information about mixing metals at high temperatures, and as a matter of fact, my field of chemistry, my lab work was called high temperature chemistry.  And I became very skilled in calorimeters.  Calorimeter they use to measure the heats of--heat changes when you bring two materials together.  And I, that was, my thesis work was on the thermochemistry of laves phases, intermetallic compounds, that is.  But I did several preliminary studies before I got to my dissertation, and I published papers on those, the heats of, mixing of fuel salts.  I mean these were very high temperatures, 500 and 600 degrees centigrade.  It was very high temperatures, not room temperatures, really.  Temperatures to melt copper, zinc, magnesium, aluminum.  Aluminum is a low melting metal for the most part, and tin is lower melting, but and then I, my--Dr. Kleppa, K-L-E-P-P-A was my thesis advisor.  He was quite, quite skilled in high temperature chemistry and construction equipment for high temperature calorimetric.  My project required using analytical chemistry a lot.  I had to be very concerned about the purity of the materials that I was using.  And it's interesting.  When I looked at my thesis this morning, I was most attracted to the chart showing the purity of the metals that I used.  And to see one there that says, this sample is 99.9999 percent pure, I said, good Heavens, is that believable.  And then some of them were 99.90 percent pure.  But if you're starting with the materials that you don't, ingredients that are not pure, you--it's very difficult.  You're going to get to that crytalon phase that you're looking for, for that compound.  And I, then this chart also gave the source of the metal, where we got it from.  We had to confirm the purity of it.  And I saw the names of some companies there.  They're probably out of business now (laughter), so over fifty years.  But it was, it was a tremendously education experience that equipped me well for the National Bureau of Standards [NIST] that I went to later, which is also the, the custodian of standards for the country, for our country.  And I worked with a lady who was the analyst--we had a special analytical chemist that we students would go to for help.  And she could do, test samples for us.  And she was, her name was Myrtle Bachelder.  But they did, when you went to those specialists for help, they charged a fee.  So you would do all you could to solve the problem before you would take your materials to them to be tested.  And then the other thing I had to do was to, if I were to design a piece of equipment, I would have to rough it out, sketch it out and make a rough prototype before taking it to the machine shop to be finished up really, precisely.  The machine shop charged also.  So that gentleman there would need a project number to charge his time to.  So what all of that process did for me was to teach me to be good with my hands.  I came out of there being a pretty good machinist by the time I finished my thesis work.  And, and frankly, the people stay in those, in the lab all through the summers and year long.  Most, a lot of that time for me consisted of doing prototypes or doing rough, rough mark-ups for something that needed to be done better.  You do the prototype to see if it's gonna work, and then you do the finished thing if the system works.  And one of the things--so I learned a lot of analytical chemistry.  I learned equipment construction.  And one of my supervisors, after I got to the Bureau said to me, something that was flattering, and he didn't know it.  He said, "Reatha, one day you're going to be an inventor," because I was good at coming up with solutions to  problems, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And if you don't find it on the shelf, the solution to the problem, then you invent it.  So it was, the work was trial and error a lot, but it required persistence and care because high temperature of anything, you burn yourself, you know.  You could, or (unclear) I did have an accident.  See, I still have the scars for it.  I had a sulfuric acid burn in the lab.  It was treated and so you, it's the kind of discipline you get in no other area, I think.  I'm biased to chemistry.  So my, I feel like, now that I look at my dissertation and I look at the published papers from my research, I, I'm very proud of them though I've been away from the research lab now for some years.  And that work led me to the National Bureau of Standards where I did some very remarkable work to help the space program, NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], 'cause we were seeking to put a person on the moon.  And I--that was a great time to be in the lab and to be connected to such significant pioneer kind of work in the country.  I mean I was, they call it "heady".  That was at--those were heady times for America and for scientists, in particular.  So the University of Chicago [Illinois], that lab and my work, research were sort of a launch pad for bigger things.  And I'm particularly proud of it.  So now I can go back and read my thesis--my dissertation like I'm reading a novel.  And I said--I think that my professor is deceased now, but I said, the University should still be pretty proud, be proud of this work.  Material Science is a very important part of, you know, our economy, an underlying part.  And after I got into, with corporations and seeing their labs and their systems, I can see how material science becomes the underpinning of a lot in our economy.
Story_ID: 20535
Speaker 1: Can you see, now we as laymen, you know, don't probably understand, after you just explained this, I still don't necessarily understand all this, but have you seen the results of your work in, with--applied to something that's, you know, that's of benefit now.  I mean can you, you know, do you see--
Speaker 2: No, you would--
Speaker 1: --portions of your research being used to--
Speaker 2: No, you wouldn't see it on the street applied.  If you were to go into a producer of tubing on metal systems, like something so simple as that post that's holding up that light there.  And if you are, you probably--no, you would not see it.  You would have to go to something that's highly refined before you, before they would get concerned about decrystaline structure there.
Speaker 1: Or maybe my question should be what, can you tell us, like how it's, you know, used?
Speaker 2: Okay, so I can translate one of the systems, preliminary systems I did leading up to it into something you would understand.  Brass, the composition of brass, brass, copper and zinc.  I never knew the makeup of brass.  You know you use brass all the time comparing with brass, silver and gold.  Silver is a pure metal.  Gold is a pure metal, but brass is alloy, is a mixture of metals.  And I have a phase chart in my, my, one of the books there, I think showing the structure of brass at various amounts in the mixture.  So you could, there are some--and another one is ceramics.  Another system I worked with would be ceramics, and it's very common ceramic, which, you know, you could--it takes a high temperature to fuse, like alumina, A-L-U-M-I-N-A, aluminum oxide.  That forms about, depending on the conditions of temperature and pressure, different curtailing structures.  So I, but you would be doing something in a laboratory or maybe for NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], where you have systems in different environments before you could see what I saw in the lab, and that is the formation of aluminum oxide and have it deposited from a, go from a very high temperature to a cold surface.  And it comes out with a powdery form.  And I open up the equipment and say, what is this with this powdery coating all over the surface.  And that was, it shows that, that--then I examined the crytality of it, the form.  It was a different crystaling form from the aluminum oxide that you would, formed under other circumstances.  You would have to have--you would be in the environment there where you would, you would have produced conditions that lended themselves to that kind of form.  And if you wanted to understand what was going on in your system, then you would analyze what this new structure was.  But for the person on the street, you wouldn't see that ordinarily.
Speaker 1: A metallurgist or someone would know--
Speaker 2: A metallurgist would see it, know.  But I did think about this.  When I saw that ship, the luxury ship that just capsized, went aground, and I said, what could have happened, they, they probably had tested, had stress tested every, every key component of the rudder and whatever keeps it afloat.  And I said, something cracked, something broke.  That's what I said to myself.  But there, you bet they're going to take, try to salvage all the pieces and, and figure out what failed, what cause a system failure there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think, now, I don't wanna get too deep into this, but I think that, I mean not from me, on my side anyway (laughter), but I think when the Titanic [RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912 after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton, UK to New York City, US. The sinking of Titanic caused the deaths of 1,502 people in one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in modern history] sunk, it had to do with the coldness of the water and the metal was really strong, but the coldness of water made it brittle or something.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, well, under extreme conditions, you get materials behaving differently, and that's what I was concerned about.  That was the nature of my research.  That, now, I went to an exhibit on the Titanic at the Science Museum [Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, Illinois], and they talked about when they brought up the Titanic, and how the scientists put everything together again.  And they were surmising what had happened.  That was a remarkable exhibit, just a few years ago.
Speaker 1: Is that basically true, though, that it became as it, as the metal was cold, under cold conditions?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I think--it's a possibility.  It could happen, but I couldn't say.  I don't recall specific reasons, but they really had a lot of minds on that.  But the, the practical application--a lot of the science is done to understand systems and materials rather than to, to drive toward practical application at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: However, the work at the National Bureau of Standards [NIST] was pushing for, toward a practical solution to a problem.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So we'll just pause here, and then we'll pick up at the National--
Story_ID: 20536
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you earned your PhD in '63 [1963]--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: But before you earned your PhD, you got married, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hum.
Speaker 1: So tell us how you met your husband and events leading to your PhD?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I met my husband, well, my husband-to-be in about, it must have been late '59 [1959] or '60 [1960] at a basketball game in the City of Chicago [Illinois].  A gentleman from Morehouse [College, in Atlanta, Georgia], a fellow student, I learned about this exhibition basketball game between Morehouse and Fisk [University in Nashville, Tennessee], I think.  I think it was Fisk.  And I think it was at a Y [YMCA] or some place in the community.  And he offered to take, escort myself and three other dorm mates from our graduate student dorm to this basketball game.  His name was Finley Campbell and he lives in Detroit [Michigan] now so we know Finley.  And my husband was there, along with other Morehouse people and Fisk graduates, you know, supporting their teams.  And Fisk knew, knew--they knew Finley, this fellow from the University of Chicago whom we had all gone with.  And later my husband called and asked if I would go out on a date with him.  And I did.  He was teaching at Englewood High School in Chicago.  He's a Morehouse graduate from Birmingham, Alabama, and he had gone to Chicago to live because he has a sister there, and he was driving cab and also teaching at the high school.  He was a chemistry major, having studied with Dr. McBay and others.  But after about a year, this fellow whom I later married decided he want to go back to, go to graduate school.  So he went, decided to go to [Clark] Atlanta University [formerly, Clark College in Atlanta, Georgia], and then after he had been in Atlanta University for about a year, or maybe a little less, he decided--he asked me if I would marry him.  Well, that was a decision, quite a decision, and I--because that meant we would be separated.  I didn't wanna stop my graduate studies.  We would be separated, have a commuting marriage.  And eventually, we decided to do that.  So we got married on December 16, 1961 and decided to get married on Morehouse College campus and then for chapel with Dr. Mays officiating at our wedding.  And Judge, my husband then, decided to stay on at [Clark] Atlanta University and complete the work for his Master's degree and then go to Howard [University, Washington, D.C] to study for a doctorate degree.  And he did that with Dr. Lloyd Ferguson--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --at Howard and whom just, who just passed.  And--
Speaker 1: We interviewed him last April, Dr. Ferguson--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --right.  I'm sorry to hear that.
Speaker 2: Then we took a little temporary, an apartment, small apartment in Atlanta.  So he finished his--I finished my work at the University of Chicago.  I had one more year, exactly one more year.  I finished my work there in December 1962.  And then by that time I'd interviewed at the National Bureau of Standards and been given a job offer from the National Bureau of Standards and the Naval Research Laboratory; decided in favor of this bureau.  And my husband and I decided we would then find an apartment in Washington, D.C. because he was going to Howard.  So that's the way it happened, and though I finished my work for the doctorate degree in December, 1962, I, my--I finished writing my thesis and graduated, I think, from the University of Chicago in April of '63 [1963].  My thesis is dated March '63' [1963], I see.  So this is--and I started work at the Bureau of Standards, actually January 1, 1963.  So a lot was happening during that time, finishing my work at the University of Chicago, starting work at the Bureau of Standards, going back to graduate at the University of Chicago in April and my husband starting Howard [University] in early 1963.  But the decision around marrying was whether I would continue my doctorial studies.  And I say, yes, I will.  I wanna finish my work.  And that was a wise decision.  And then he finished his doctorial studies at Howard, while I worked at the National Bureau of Standards.  And we had two children while I worked there.  So it was--

Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's the way it happened, and by the way, Dr. [Benjamin] Mays was very proud of my decision because that was his alma mater too, the University of Chicago [Illinois].  And he, he was very supportive of us.
Speaker 1: Now, there's a photograph of Dr. Mays at the wedding, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.  He officiated at our wedding there on campus.  And we met with him before and his wife, and we met with her to get her advice for newlyweds, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have any personal reflections of Dr. Mays?
Speaker 2: I just admired him.  I had known about him while I was at Clark [College] because he was a very impressive figure, you know, around, and the national community.  We knew he was a Baptist minister.  He was friends with the president of Clark.  I had known about him, but I didn't, I had not met him before this encounter.  He knew about me through Dr. McBay.  He knew that I had gone from Clark to the University of Chicago to get a doctorate degree in chemistry.  Dr. Mays was always looking for blacks with doctorate degrees to consider working at Morehouse [College] (unclear).  He was always scouting for potential faculty.  So he knew that I was sort of in the pipeline.  And Judge, my husband, had graduated from Morehouse, and he knew him from--he knew all the Morehouse people.  But that was my first personal experience with Dr. Mays--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when he would be marrying us.  And then I met with his wife, Sadie Mays, separately, and she asked, I believe, to meet with us.  And she wanted to give me some advice, and one piece of advice, "Never go to bed mad with each other", and the other one is "whatever you earn, save part of it".  And my husband said I never forgot that.  So they were--
Speaker 1: That's good.
Speaker 2: --they got up front and personal with you.
Story_ID: 20538
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you continue to publish papers after you graduated and--
Speaker 2: Yes, after I graduated, I published, in the open literature in a magazine called, a journal called 'Octave Metallurgical', the work for my doctorate degree.  And then immediately after I got to the--oh, and I published with my professor two other studies from the University of Chicago [Illinois].  One was on the thermochemistry, some fuse salts, and then another one on the copper zinc, the brass system, and those were not the main, main projects for my doctorate degree though.  And then immediately after I got to the National Bureau of Standards [NIST: National Institute of Standards and Technology], this was in 1963, my supervisor asked me to do two projects in another kind of calorimetry, called bum calorimetry.  And that was burning samples of materials in an atmosphere of oxygen and it was a well-known technique call bum calorimetry.  It was, and that was mostly a training project to get me accustomed to some of the procedures of the lab there.  My main project for, during my stay at the Bureau was, was a project that the Bureau was funded to do by the Defense Department.  And one of their agents is called the Advanced Research Project agency, ARPA, was the funding entity.  And they wanted the Bureau to do some test on a material called oxygen Difluoride.  And Oxygen Difluoride, they wanted the heater formation of Oxygen Difluoride, and it was to, it was under review to be a possible fuel sample for, in the system to boost the rocket into space, to put a person on the moon.  So it was a NASA related project, NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration]-sponsored project and very exciting.  The one problem is the Oxygen Difluoride was corrosive under the, under certain conditions, very corrosive.  And the reaction we chose to study it was with hydrogen.  Now, and that led to a highly corrosive product, hydrogen fluoride, one, and water.  Well, hydrogen fluoride, you know, etches glass.  So materials handling in every way turned out to be tedious and difficult.  One, you were working with gaseous systems and we designed a technique or fine-tuned a technique called flow calorimetry because we were mixing gases in a flow system, and it took, emission, flourine flame calorimetry, flouride and flame calorimetry required us to produce a flame.  Once we got the oxygen difluoride into this hydrogen atmosphere, we would ignite, introduce it, and that produces a flame, and then we measured the heat and the energy from that reaction.  And you wanted to collect and account for all of the products.  And we could, we were mainly interested in accounting for the, the flourine, they hydrogen fluoride.  And so you had to collect it in the proper kind of vessel and, otherwise, the hydrogen fluoride could eat its way through.  And that produced some, you could have some very inaccurate results.  That project led to studies with the, several inner halogen compounds, chlorine with florine, chlorine trifloride, chlorine pentafluoride and that was, as well as, the combination of fluorine and hydrogen directly, where you were just burning fluorine in the hydrogen and producing hydrogen fluoride trapping the product in water.  That was--now before getting to the bureau and working on that project, I never even considered inner halogen compounds, never--so I was learning something new.  And you just need the periodic chart and you saw the halogen group there, and you, with Chlorine, iodine, bromine (ph.), and you just heard that those were very reaction gases.  So, this was, you were learning something new every day and then to do exploring to find the kind of metal, metal tubing that would be inert to these highly corrosive materials.  That was, that's the day my supervisor told me, when I told him, I said, I think I have solved the problem.  And he agreed with me, and he said, Reatha, I think one day you're going to be an inventor.  But it was a lot of tinkering.  It was a lot tinkering.  And I--the exciting part was to know that the people at NASA [National Aeronautical and Space Administration] and your oversight agency were waiting on these results because they had a particular interest in this material, oxygen difluoride.  Now, you wasn't driving toward any, any result there.  You're just giving them the accurate information and whether it fit their need, they, you never knew because they promptly had put a project, funded projects in other places as well.  As a matter of fact, they needed--and whatever you gave them, they probably would verify it out there in some way.  But for a young scientist, it was just a great feeling to be connected to such a, such a critical project.  My side work at the Bureau was to test fuel samples for submarines or for any other project.  But this particular one was for an agency that was involved in a lawsuit around the performance of submarine fuel.  And so, but the Bureau, as part of its mission did tests upon requests from other agencies.  And I would need to interrupt my research project at times to perform, do these tests that had been requested of the Bureau.  And that turned out to be quite an exciting piece of work because the Bureau had a reputation for accuracy and precision and you wanted to learn the skills for providing those kinds of results.  So, while I was rejected because of gender from positions in industrial labs or corporate labs-well, maybe rejected is too strong a word, but women applicants had a hard time because of your gender and the government turned out to be sort of the hirer of last resort there, the government labs.  I lucked out to I think a great place, no better place that I could have gone than the Bureau of Standards for my kind of work, measurements and material science.  It was just remarkable.  And to work with such talented scientists and esteemed scientists.  So that's, that was, and then I, I worked there until 1968 for about five and a half years.  And my husband by then had graduated from Howard [University] and gotten a job, he took a job at Nassau Community College in Garden City, Long Island [New York] as chair of the department of chemistry.  And we moved because he wanted to take that job.  And so I resigned my position at the National Bureau of Standards and started teaching at York College of the City University of New York [CUNY].  That would, that brought me into the, into academia as an assistant professor of chemistry.  And then I moved through the ranks in administration and also as a faculty member.
Story_ID: 20539
Speaker 1: Did you find that an easy transition to go from, you know, working for the Department of, for the government to teaching?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was--
Speaker 1: From research to teaching.
Speaker 2: --it was a unique, you said, did I find it to be a unique transition or unusual?
Speaker 1: Yeah, or did you find it difficult to move from doing research to teaching?
Speaker 2: Yes, I didn't find it difficult in terms of the subject matter, you know, getting used to preparing for your courses and working with students.  What I found challenging was getting used to the faculty environment and the kind of, the faculty meetings.  It was a different kind of professionalism, that I had to get used to.  The Bureau of Standards [NIST], and the scientists and working with the scientists on and off campus at the Bureau that was a highly professional setting.  When I went into academia, it was just about '68 [1968], and the campus tensions around the Vietnam War [1955-1975] were very strong and tensions on campus were very strong.  And that was, you know, as a young faculty member, coming out of that very professional environment, you asked where am I?  You had to do that.  So you had to--the adjustment was with your fellow faculty members and getting used to the kind of conversations that you needed to engage in with them.  But to be honest with you, I thrived on it later because I brought some skills from my work environment at the Bureau that served me well in relating to peers on campus.  And also this was a young university, and they needed willing hearts and willing heads and willing hands.  And I was very willing to pitch in and help out.  And I rose through the ranks rather well.  But it was an adjustment, a big adjustment.  But mainly, it was because of the, the kind of professionalism that I found compared to the professionalism in the environment that I left.  But it was a joy working with students.  So that was, that was something to--you could, you got leverage over there to deal with the frustrations that you felt there.
Story_ID: 20540
Speaker 1: Okay, so, how many black faculty were there?  I mean were you, were there just a few of you or were there many or--
Speaker 2: There were a few of us at the time.  However, this was in the City University of New York [CUNY], and the tensions were not on campus, was not black versus white, as much as it was are you--where you stood on the issue around the war, and the social change issues in the community.
Speaker 1: Was there a black student organization?
Speaker 2: The agitation wasn't coming so much from a black student organization.  This was totally a new campus.  The agitation was coming in disagreement amongst faculty themselves.  And there was an administrative situation where this was a faculty in temporary quarters and on the campus of Queensboro Community College [New York] and we were trying to decide a site.  The City University of New York was deciding a site for this new campus.  See, the college was just in the second year when I went there.  So you had the site decision, you had the--which people had a point of view, and there was polarization about.  You had the tensions around the war, and there was polarization around that, the position that faculty and students should take.  There was quite a lot of anger in the external environment about that.  So it was--and, but still, I had a lot to do.  I was able to pitch in and work with my fellow science faculty especially, science and math, and I became Associate Dean for Academic--no, Associate Dean for Natural Sciences and Mathematics after my third year there, and started ranking--
Speaker 1: Now, the year you got there, Dr. King [Martin Luther King Jr.] was assassinated, Bobby Kennedy [President Robert F. Kennedy] was assassinated--
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  You had, yeah, so a lot of social tensions, societal tensions.  And the campus--the York College, like all the other campuses was sort of immersed in this environment of change that's happening.  I, but that, that challenged me and helped me learn new skills.  And I was able to care for our family, and my husband and I would pitch in and care for our family.  So we had that responsibility there to deal with.  And I just dove in, worked with my students and fellow faculty members and made the best of it.
Story_ID: 20541
Speaker 1: Okay.  During your tenure there, is there any one thing that you're the proudest of doing?
Speaker 2: At York College [CUNY]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  I think, we, we did a great job expanding--well, see, it was a new college.  In the sciences right away, we set about recruiting students, you know, getting the word out about York College's mission and encouraging students to come.  We printed a brochure, an outreach brochure.  I was proud of student recruitment.  I was very proud of the way the curriculum developed.  We added new programs, Allied Health Science programs.  We added a component, computer in the curriculum.  Computers were just becoming prominent in, computers in the classroom.  And we were able to recruit some outstanding faculty in all fields.  Being a new college, many of the faculty had come over from other campuses, Brooklyn College [New York], in particular.  I remember several of them had transferred over from, had been at Brooklyn College.  But we were able to fill in and recruit some new faculty members.  There were--and I was also responsible as Associate Dean for helping to construct a new temporary building, a new science building in Jamaica Queens [neighborhood in New York].  You see we were in temporary shelter on the campus of another college.  And we needed to relocate to, to a more prominent facility.  And we, we--they constructed a science building.  And I was able to, help oversee, the campus architects oversee the construction of that building and get us re--and get us located into that.  So, and I was all of thirty-one--about thirty-two years old.  I wasn't, I was pretty young, and this was--and had two young sons.  And my husband was working so, that was hefty responsibility for me but very productive.
Story_ID: 20542
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you also get involved in, you start developing an interest in management, I guess because you're doing all this administration.  So you went on sabbatical with a fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation, and in '77 [1977], you went on to earn an M.B.A from Columbia [University], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.  Well, after six years at York College [CUNY], I became--I qualified for a sabbatical year.  And my, I was at the crossroads then, asking the question, should I stay in academia or should I go back to research full time or should I consider working with businesses more closely.  What I, what appealed to me about the Bureau of Standards [NIST] was that I was in the right contact with quite a few businesses and with people that I enjoyed working with.  They were the suppliers of our materials.  And I mentioned about having that chart in my thesis showing the specifications, the purity of those samples, and then I was--there's the column showing where you got them from.  I liked the professionalism of those people I worked with for my lab.  And I said, gee whiz, maybe I should consider future employment in a business lab, again, the corporate one.  So I was at the crossroads with all the, asking these questions.  And so I finally thought that if I wanted to move higher in administration as a woman, I would need to demonstrate how to handle--that I could handle money and understand something about the management of organizations.  So I started looking, I said, where could I go to improve my skills and knowledge in that regard.  And I started looking at business schools.  I went, specifically, I went up to Harvard and met with their assistant dean for admissions.  He said you have a good business school right in your backyard there.  With your responsibilities, two children and a family, why don't you consider Columbia [University]?  Why don't you go over there?  It was very wise counseling.  I went to their admissions office, talked with them about how to use this sabbatical year.  And now, they told me about the Rockefeller Foundation fellowship.  And I, as luck would have it, met a man there named Bruce, I think it was Bruce Williams.  Bruce was the program officer in charge of this fellowship program for black professionals.  Their intent was to provide business education for people who would go and work in the historically black colleges because they were short of people trained with business skills in their finance area especially, in the business office.  So Bruce, though, he said, though you're unsure, why don't you apply for the fellowship anyway.  And I did, and I got the Rockefeller Fellowship and went to Columbia and got an M.B.A degree.  So that was, that was a good decision.  The coincidence later was that Bruce was a native of St. Paul, Minnesota and I didn't know that St. Paul would be in my future, you know, was in my future and that he would know people in St. Paul.  So when I graduated--no, when I applied for the position in Minnesota, and it was announced that I was appointed, Bruce read about it in the paper and called to congratulate me and told me the background, his, about Minnesota.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, let's pause here and we'll pick up.
Story_ID: 20543
Speaker 1: All right, here we go.  And okay, all right, so Bruce Williams has connections with St. Paul [Minnesota].  So how did you wind up applying for--is this how you wind up applying for the job at Metropolitan State [University]?
Speaker 2: No, that was totally different from him.  And, well, just as I was finishing my work, no, in the midst of my work at Columbia [University] while I was on that sabbatical, I got a contact from the American Council on Education [Washington, D.C].  They have, had there an office for Women in Higher Education.  And they, their mission for this particular office was trying to find women about the country to nominate for university presidents.  At that time there was, there were few women presidents of public universities.  And there was a gender bias, frankly, again, appointing women to those positions.  So this office set out to challenge that situation.  And they sent me a letter asking if they could nominate me for this position in Minnesota as president of the University.  And I talked with my husband about it.  I could see myself standing there now in the dining room, and he said, yeah, apply.  I think we will, if you get the position, we'll move.  I don't think he thought I was gonna get the position.  Anyway, I applied, went through the process, and they invited me to come for the preliminary interview.  There were two sets of interviews.  I first went and then I made that stage, got through that stage, and then I went back--they invited him to come with me for the final interview.  And they asked me, both of us if I would take the position if offered.  And we decided that we would, and that meant we would move from New York.  They interviewed four candidates.  I was one of them, in August 1977, and they selected me.  And we moved from Long Island to New York--I mean to Minnesota.  And, no, that was an era of considerable social change to try to get minorities and women in some positions where they had been resisted.  And both, that was happening in several fields, higher education, philanthropy and so forth.  And they're still--but anyway, I'll stop there.  But, no, Bruce didn't nominate me.  It was--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --this other group.
Speaker 1: Well, how did this--well, I'm not even gonna ask.  I won't ask that question.
Speaker 2: Go right ahead, go right ahead, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's okay.  A better question is about Metro[Metropolitan] State.  Now, it's unique-- It's just upper division college, right?
Speaker 2: At the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was upper division, and it was the seventh university in the Minnesota State University system, and it was upper division college, Bachelorette level plan to provide more educational opportunities for adult learners.  And I started there August, 1977, very end of the month.  And it just thrived, but it--now, I think it's four-year Bachelorette.  It's the--but I was there eleven years, a long time and able to get a lot of things done.
Speaker 1: So is Metro State in Minneapolis [Minnesota] or St. Paul [Minnesota]?
Speaker 2: Both.  It's in both, yes.  The headquarters is in St. Paul, and then the--it has a downtown location in Minneapolis.  It's co-located with the Minneapolis Community Technical Institute.  It's on their campus.  And it has some other locations, one in the Midway.  But this main campus now is in St. Paul.
Story_ID: 20544
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this made you the first African American and the first woman of a public higher educational institution president, right, of a public--
Speaker 2: In Minnesota.  I don't know if I was the first--I believe I might have been the first African American woman president in the country ever, public institution.  But I don't know that.  I know in Minnesota, it was.  And that was, it was--this was 1977, oh, quite a year for focus on social changes like that.  And there was some other unique things happening in higher education too.  Metropolitan State [University] was innovative was considered non-traditional, innovative, and I would say sturdy, not fly-by-night, you know.  But there was quite a bit of resistance to changes in concept in higher education.  I had to hit the street and the job was a selling job to convince people that you can get a quality education through this kind of institution.  And you had to win over--see, it was publicly funded.  So it took some lobbying.  You had to win over legislators, yeah, you have to win over all the skeptics.  There were quite a few skeptics about doing something different like that.  I mean adult learners on campuses, period, you know.  There was a lot of bias toward traditionally students and a lot of attitudes about adult learners.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this was a commuter kind of a campus?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There were no dormitories, no sports teams.
Story_ID: 20545
Speaker 1: And various pared down, in those respects anyway.  Now, what were you proudest of as president of Metro State [Metropolitan State]?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, first of all I was--three things I'm gonna mention.  First and foremost, straightening the fiscal administration out.  The board, the board very much wanted a president who could bring order to our fiscal management.  It was just six years old, but the recordkeeping and the, the orderliness of the fiscal records just wasn't there.  The auditor had just, the state auditor had just completed his work, his work.  And he left thirty-one recommendations.  And the board didn't like that, and when they interviewed the candidates--frankly, they picked the candidate who could best tackle that problem.  That was fundamental.  And so I knew I could do that because I was just out of the Columbia Business School [Columbia University].  And I had studied exactly what you needed to do.  And I had the discipline to do it, having demonstrated that in the laboratory and other places.  The other thing, though, was, and this was number one importance, to bring confidence, to get the faculty more confident about the viability of the school.  Because it was a non-traditional, and there were complaints about it in the public, I found the faculty with low confidence and a lot of concern about the viability.  They believed in it, but they were concerned about what people at the University of Minnesota [Minneapolis, Minnesota] thought and said and people in (unclear).  So I said, you gotta get out there and explain the school to them, and legislators.  So I was able win people over to show that, not only was the place viable, it was the future.  And so I, I accomplished that--and that is a president's job, you know, to do that.  The other things is that the enrollment started to mushroom, to grow, to grow.  And to, and there was a fourth thing that was very significant, was to develop the foundation to start private fundraising.  We had a foundation on the books, but it wasn't highly functional and I, with the help of the trustees that were there--first, define the role of the trustees and then recruited more.  And we just, we just won people over and got donors and the thing became--the foundation became one of the leading entities.  It led us in a lot of areas that needed to be beefed up.  And the thing here in Minnesota, the thing, the selling point was the enrollment growth.  If, you know, that's the first thing the legislators want to know, who cares about the place.  And what I did was to work with the graduates who had graduated from the place and let them tell the story, why it was important.  The good thing about adult students is that they vote too (laughter).  They have the ear of the legislators in their district, so they can--and they can be credible in telling their story.  But we had a strategy.  We had a strategy that worked beautifully, and other presidents who came later have built on that.  And I, I--if I were to--and I came in with the traditional credentials, you know, with doctorate degree and the PhD in science, and with--but I was black; I was a woman.  So I was different in that regard.  And I went outside of Minnesota in the higher education circles and made friends and got a lot of moral support from Father Ted Hessburg of, at Notre Dame [University] who was very active in higher education circles.  Mr. Bach, president of Howard--Harvard [University] at the time.  He was very active in the American Council on Education, and President Bill Friday, president of University of North Carolina.  One, one advantage to me was that Metropolitan State [University] was on the map because it was different.  People knew about it, and they greatly admired it out of the state of Minnesota as an innovation whose time had come.  And we had to get the local people to believe that.  And, but I got a lot of moral support from these people outside of the univer--outside of Minnesota, and I took advantage of it.  So I didn't have a pity party with myself, worrying about people didn't love me here.  I just called my friends in these other places and worked with them and got their counsel.  And it worked, it worked.  But soon after I was there, the computer came into being.  And one of the indications to me that things were becoming more decentralized was that I saw change on the way, was decentralized libraries, decentralized computers, and I said, other campuses can have a lot of snob appeal.  But I think we're all gonna under pressure to produce because the consumer, things are shifting to the hands of the consumer.  But I was tough on academics.  If there wasn't the quality, I'd tell the faculty, we've just got to do something about it.  So that was the story.  It was, it was a wonderful story.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were there ten years?
Speaker 2: Eleven.
Speaker 1: Eleven years, okay.
Speaker 2: I was going in--I was in my twelfth year, two months into my twelfth year.
Story_ID: 20546
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and the enrollment had been increased from 1,600 to 5,000 graduates per year, six Bachelorette programs added, a graduate program in management, you know, just--so, General Mills [Inc.] calls one day, and then what happened?  Tell us what happened.
Speaker 2: Oh, it was July of 1988, I received a call from the then CEO of General Mills.  His name is Bruce Atwater.  And Bruce called to let me know that the head of their foundation, their philanthropic foundation was retiring.  And they planned to replace him, and the trustees of the foundation wanted them to start with me and ask if I could come for an interview or to talk with him about the position.  They had, by that time asked a search firm to give them some names of people from, who might--that they might consider to meet certain criteria.  They had had that done quietly.  So they had my name on the list, and Bruce said the trustees wanted him to start with me.  So he was calling to ask if he could come to my office and tell me a little more about the position.  And that was a Friday morning--he said, I'd like to come over today.  That was in the morning and about eleven, and he came over at about three o'clock to my office in St. Paul.  My office was downtown St. Paul.  And, oh, he just told me a little about their situation, the company, the--he brought their statement of corporate values and asked me to think about it.  I was going to Wichita [State University, Kansas] to give a talk, and to--I told him I wanted to think about it over the weekend.  I wanted to talk with my husband.  He asked me if I would keep it confidential and I asked him if I could talk with my family about it.  He said, oh, sure.  So I talked with my husband about it, and he wasn't sure.  I was very happy at Metropolitan State [University].  So, he said, oh, Reatha, I don't know.  But then I talked with our two sons.  One wasn't sure.  The youngest one--the oldest one said, mom, you should take that job.  He thought it was exciting.  So I did go for the interview, and I talked with other trustees and after about a week and a half, I decided that I would go, accept the job at the foundation.  One of the things I considered was I had been at Metropolitan State, I was in my twelfth year and the average tenure, what was considered a good tenure for a university president, of a public university was seven years.  So I thought to myself, these jobs can be political and they can be volatile, and, you know, I'd better take a serious look at how long I should stay here.  And to the disappointment of the faculty and the board members, I decided to go into philanthropy and go to General Mills.  That's the way it happened, and it was, and I stayed there fifteen years.  Fourteen years as president and one year as chair of the board of the trustees.  I retired in 2003.  So that was, that's the way it happened.  But Bruce was, became--he was chair of the board of trustee for the foundation over there.  But they appointed me as vice president of the company and also president and executive of the foundation.  So it was a double role that worked exceptionally well for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But there again, my business, that M.B.A., gave me quite a bit of comfort- ability with companies, and I didn't realize that at the time, but even in my work as president of Metropolitan State, I felt very comfortable in and out of companies when I would seek support from them or talk with them about their recruiting and what have you.  So that's the way it happened, and--
Story_ID: 20547
Speaker 1: So what does the General Mills Foundation basically fund?
Speaker 2: Four main areas-- four program areas.  One big one is education and we have, there we make--it's grant making to organizations, colleges and universities, big in the United Negro College Fund [UNCF], and American Indian College Fund and Hispanic College Fund.  It was, and it has a very generous gift-matching programs, for education.  The other three program areas are arts and culture, family life and health and nutrition.  And in recent years they've developed a big focus in international giving, a global dimension that's just been added to that, to the philanthropy, company's philanthropy.  But it's the--today it hosts and sponsors a very large breakfast program for the--on Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday.  That was today.  I started that when I was at the foundation.  Now, it's over twenty years old.  So it has a few signature programs that the whole company engages in.  And, but it, it's a little unique and it provides quite a bit of operating support money to organizations.  Operating support money is not easy to come by.  So many people shy away from it.  When I was there, 40 percent of the budget went for operating support grants.  And I was a staunch supporter of that because it gives organizations stability in communities, you know.  And if you're gonna have a stable community out there, you need some stability in your social service and arts and culture organizations.  So I, I enjoy that work very much.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, the year you started, you were named the Twin Citizen of the Year.
Speaker 2: Yes, oh, that was in, that's right 1988.  That was sort of a culmination of the, my work at Metropolitan State [University].  But that, that magazine is over there where my picture is on the front, that was, that was a bold move for that magazine, to be honest with you.  And I was very proud of it because they named some other people who are local heroes there.  I was very proud of it.  But I, we did some, with Metropolitan State University, we did some bold strokes, I would say.  The founding of that university was a bold stroke itself, and the founder by then, was deceased.  And, and I, coming into a state with my whole family and moving our whole family here and being--it took a little courage on that part, a state so different from my home state of Georgia and my husband's home state of Birmingham, Alabama.  It was just, it was just different for us.  And, but I really embraced the community, embraced people, and I--and they responded in kind.  And I work with a lot of other non-profits so I had--that was with a lot of humility, I felt rather proud of that, that achievement, for the faculty and the students and others, the supporters of the school, not for myself necessarily, but, you know, you get a lot of achievements along the way, but the people you work with, it's a blessing for them as well.

Speaker 1: Okay, now, you were a chair of the board of directors of the Minnesota Council on Foundations.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Who else served with you on that board?
Speaker 2: Oh, representatives from several other foundations.  That's what we call the regional associations for foundations and giving programs.  And in addition to, well, I succeeded a woman who's in charge of the giving program at St. Paul [Minnesota] Companies at the time, but we have, if I recall correctly, the Minnesota, the St. Paul Foundation might have had a representative--we have community foundations in the community.  St. Paul Foundation, the Minneapolis Foundation, we have the McKnight Foundation.  We have the Headwaters Fund, I recall that, the head of that, Headwaters Funds.  We have Target Foundation.  Then it was Dayton-Hudson when I was chair of the board.  We had, and we have foundations in Duluth.  This is, this organization is a statewide association of foundations.  I, of the specific names, I recall Mary Decard (ph.), who's connected with the St. Paul Foundation because she--companies, she was chair of the board at the time.  But there were several representatives, but these were probably some of the representative foundations on there.  That marked, that probably was one of the milestone points connected with my entry into philanthropy.  See, that was, I was career building there.  It was a different career for me going from president of a university to head of the General Mills Foundation.  And now, becoming established in another industry, another kind of community, work community, getting to know the foundation world, locally, regionally and nationally.  It's just like I had--by the time I left Metropolitan State [University], I had gotten to know the higher education world and community.  Now, you got to do that all over again for the foundation community, for the philanthropic community.  And that activity--by then I was also on the board of the Council on Foundations which is the National Associations of Foundations in the country, and they're headquartered in Arlington, Virginia.  I was on that board, and I became a strong voice for diversifying foundations and having foundations become more inclusive.  It was, so I was a champion for diversity and inclusivity and eliminating, getting rid of gender bias and bias against minorities.  And I became a strong voice for that, and I chaired the key committee for the National Council on Foundations board of directors.  They call it the inclusiveness committee, the inclusiveness committee.  But, I could see fruits from that work now that make me very proud, and I--it is clear that we have, for some time, we were not accepted into key roles in these organizations.  And the question, and it's an important question today, can you be a voice for change and, if so, how?  That, you're gonna figure out, you know, if you're committed enough, and if you have enough respect for your colleagues you're working alongside, you're gonna figure that out.  But I enjoyed that work.  That's a longwinded answer, the "who else was on the board with you".
Story_ID: 20549
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's good, though.  I mean I don't expect you to remember every name.  But that's a good answer.  And you also were appointed by President [William] Clinton in '94 [1994] to the board of the Corporation for National Community Service which was one of the, I think one of the most important things that the Clinton administration did--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --revived VISTA [Volunteers and Service to America] and service learning.  Tell us what you did.
Speaker 2: And AmeriCorps--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --led to the formation, creation of AmeriCorps.  Well, I was on the predecessor organization that was established by Mr. Bush, Senior, George W. Bush, what George Walker Bush [43rd President of the United States], that was the Commission for National and Community Service.  It was a slightly different name, but Mr. Clinton continued my appointment when he came into office on this one.  That was quite, it was quite a challenge because at first, you know, they were seeking funding.  Well, there were attitudes about paying people to do volunteer work.  It was ideological sort of confrontation there.  So Eli Segal, I don't know whether you remember that name--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Eli Segal, right.
Speaker 2: --who's now deceased was a friend of service, and he had worked with the (unclear) city you're in and Boston [Massachusetts], and before that under Mr. Bush, Sr., it was Governor George Romney of Michigan, former governor of Michigan was on the commission.  And I think he was one of the chairs or co-chairs.  Anyway, he was a friend of the Service movement, but there were some people in Congress, outside of Congress who saw the stopping arrangement as paying young people to serve.  And they didn't believe philanthropically that you should do that.  And then the "Points of Light Foundation" came into being, if you remember that, that helped to champion.  So I was in the, helped to champion a lot of these notions.  I was in the midst a lot of this attitudinal change that's happening.  And I--then Harris Wafford came along to be president, I think, of the commission, and he did a masterful job working with Congress to deal with some of these notions.  And along the way AmeriCorps became rooted and VISTA became saved and it was, it was quite an outstanding experience.  But you're close to the public policy arena in Washington in the shaping of public policy, and there's no--you got to deal with those attitudes, ideological attitudes, along there.
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety four [1994] was the Republican Revolution [what the media dubbed the Republican Party (GOP) success in the 1994 U.S. midterm elections.], led by Newt Gingrich, right, where they took over the House [the United States House of Representatives].
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.  Now, we had, Minnesota had commission back here that was connecting to that commission too.  There were state commissions, and we had some friendly voices back here for all of these, amongst the politicians, former governors.  So the notion of AmeriCorps had friends back here in Minnesota.
Speaker 1: I know Paul Wellstone was--
Speaker 2: Yes, indeed, Yes, indeed.  And I saw AmeriCorps, and I still do, as sort of what the peace--the thing that we abroad that we have success with--
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is a domestic Peace Core.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a domestic Peace Corp.  I saw that, and I see AmeriCorps people now are doing some wonderful work, you know, around.  I, yeah, I--I enjoyed that service.  I, you know, that gets you to the White House.  It gets you to working with public policy people very closely.  We traveled down to other locations and it was all worthwhile.  Hadn't I been at General Mills, you know, I'm not sure--well, that gave them that connection to a corporation too with my being there, having been at General Mills.
Speaker 1: Okay, we have to pause here again.
Story_ID: 20550
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety nine [1999], you were selected by the 'Minneapolis Star Tribune' as one of the most 100 Influential Minnesotans of the last century.  Now, that seems like a big honor.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, well, there were several people selected.  That was '99 [1999], yeah, that we were going into 2000.  I, I felt humbled by their designation.  But I, I'd gotten to the point by then where I, I would--I couldn't, I was just embracing the total public very well, very comfortable with it, in and outside of the Twin Cities [Minneapolis and St. Paul Minnesota].  And I had gone to other sections of Minnesota with great excitement, you know.  And being at Metropolitan State [University], I got a chance to do that because the state university board would have its meetings on other campuses.  But I had done lots of community service by then, working with different organizations and with people of different backgrounds.  And they had done a few feature stories on how I got from 'A' to 'B', you know, in terms of upbringing, and my following the opportunity journey, you know, the journey to get opportunities to get doors opened is sort of like a journey.  You know, you just follow the opportunity trail, and that opportunity trail had taken me to some unusual places like to Pawley, New York working as a maid, you know, at such a young age, at the University of Chicago [Illinois], far away from my home state and family.  They had done quite a bit of research, and frankly, how they, why they chose me over fancier people, I never figured it out.  But it certainly was an inspiration, you know.  And when, frankly, most of the time--I would do my work and do it well, but I'm not a social climber, and I don't seek out social situations just because they're important or there're important people there.  I spent a lot of my time trying to car pool my children, getting them to their rehearsals and their music lessons and things like that.  So a lot of my time was focused on my family.  And apparently, they were aware of that too.  I would go to my board meetings.  By that time, I was serving on several corporate boards, boards of directors.  And I was meeting a lot of different people through those channels and meeting a lot of different people through the channels in Washington [D.C].  So I think that's how that came about.  I'm, I'm rambling because I'm trying to think back on why it came about and how.
Speaker 1: They chose you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they chose me.
Speaker 1: You didn't choose yourself, so they chose you so they know, they--apparently, they know about all, a lot of your good work and chose you for that reason.  Now, in 2002, you retired from General Mills [Incorporation], right?
Speaker 2: 2002 I retired from running the General Mills Foundation-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I stayed on a year to chair the board of directors.  And I officially retired then at sixty-five.  They have a mandatory retirement age at sixty-five.
Story_ID: 20551
Speaker 1: And then you went on to serve as Louis W. Hill, Jr. Fellow in Philanthropy at Hubert Humphrey Center at the University of Minnesota.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.  Yeah, that was, that was a call out of the blue too.  And they chose me, and I was just delighted.  They, they on purpose wanted an experienced philanthropist or community person, and I was delighted.  It had a stipend, respectable stipend, and, but I wanted--
Speaker 1: This is to teach, right.  Let me be clear.  They wanted you to teach?
Speaker 2: To do a research project.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: To do research, and I ended up engaging with the faculty in seminars in small group sessions.  And so there was a lot of sharing of what I knew and picking up on--sharing of learning between us.  But basically, the fellowship was to enable me to do research, and--on some significant topic in philanthropy, and I welcomed that because my work in philanthropy had been so practical and applied that I did not have the knowledge for the scholarship in the field that I wanted.  And they have some faculty scholars in philanthropy in the non-profit sector over there, that I was able to work with.  I did a project, a research project, interviewing people and then writing a significant paper on public policy and government, working together to make a bigger difference.  'Philanthropy and Public Policy: Working Together to Make a Bigger Difference', that was the title of my project, 'Philanthropy and Public Policy: Working Together to Make a Bigger Difference'.  And the whole idea was to get the community, those two communities, more comfortable working in partnership with each other.  My assumption at the time, and I think I've proved this, is that some of our bigger problems, community problems can't be solved by philanthropy alone.  We're going to have to work with government, and the question is, why can't we work more comfortably together.  And I, you have a lot of philanthropists who go to the community with a project idea like they're gonna solve the problem.  The problem is too big.  You don't have enough money, and most times, you don't commit yourself for long enough to solve the problems.  But you can provide seed money and catalyst money that can make a tremendous difference.  But you gotta have, you gotta have somebody with deep pockets usually and with staying power to make a sustainable difference.  And that's where government comes in.  Government can institutionalize progress much better than foundations and people who are doing shorter-term philanthropy, so institutionalizing progress should be the goal.  I interviewed about sixty people, legislators, non-profit people and foundation reps and got in a lot of good information on how the two sectors can work together better.  And I got--the most unusual part of it was the perceptions that government people have of philanthropists as their, in terms of their strengths and perceptions that philanthropists have of government people.  I knew some of that because I've heard them talk.  But I was, I was really excited about what the government people feel we can bring to the table, you know, in partnerships.  That was, that project clearly rejuvenated me as a professional because when you leave an office as intense as the General Mills Foundation has been and the company, you feel dried up, you know.  You need to rejuvenate yourself (unclear).  And that scholarly project did that for me.  And I came out of there just feeling very excited about my other work for the future.  So it was--and I was able to do that, come back to a campus setting to do that here, the, you know, the Hubert Humphrey Institute was a good place to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How was your paper received?  I mean did people really--do you think that most people see the need to partner government with philanthropy?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was received very well.  And I presented it at a national conference.  I think it was called the NOVA [National Organization for Victim Assistance] Conference.  And I co-presented it with one of the faculty members here, very well received.  And I did, I presented parts of it to the Council on Foundations.  And it's a great paper for professional development of philanthropists, frankly.  But it, it--the legislators asked the philanthropists to do something that philanthropists aren't inclined to do, unfortunately, and that is to come to the congressional chambers, come to the legislative chambers and participate in hearings, committee hearings and observe the committee sessions.  Philanthropists thought, too many see that as a tainted environment.  No, no, stay distant from that, those public policy debates, you know.  And so many of the legislatures felt that they wished the philanthropists would show up and lend their voice and participate in those conversations around--and so it was--the feedback was good for professional development of philanthropists in helping them learn how to do their work better.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it was well received.
Story_ID: 20552
Speaker 1: Okay.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Oh, my hopes and concerns--well, they reside on having--well, to have, number one, better engagement with each other, especially, if you look at the economic strata levels of our community, have more engagement between this level and the level down there.  I, I just--it pains me.  I have some friends who don't wanna go into the low-income communities as they would call them.  That pains me, and now, you can understand.  That's the community I came from.  That's where I came from, though, it was safer then, you know, you might say when I was there.  But I think I would, I would--first and foremost like to see more extensive engagement between the educated--those who have and those who don't and more willingness for those who have to mentor and advise those who don't.  And when I say what they don't have, often they don't have resources, but they don't have ideas--they don't have information.  They don't have the knowledge-based information about careers, for example.  And they don't have motivation for any number of reasons.  I think we gotta find that out.  I, that's what I would wish for.  Now, yes, what do you wish for the African American community.  So I'm thinking about what we can do for our own community first (chuckle), and then looking outside of our community, I yearn for better engagement by others to learn better what the African American people are about in our country and not--and to stop making assumptions about our community, about us and bad assumptions, false assumptions.  And I'm, I'm not very scolded about politicians and their views, but I've heard candidates, for example, for office, say things and I shook my head--I shake my head.  That's not true, that's not true.  But, so I think there's a lot of misinformation and there's a lack of information about people who are different from you, you know, ourselves.  I suppose we have that same problem where we don't understand other communities.  So I, I think for the African American community, I wish, I yearn for more opportunities for our people, our people to have more opportunities.  And I, I have pictures with young people and, with whom I have talked and encouraged to get outside of their community as best they can and to learn because you've got--and then to be willing to prepare themselves so that they will have more opportunities.  I used to go into a lot of community agencies, and I hear young people saying I wanna, I wanna go out.  I wanna visit General Mills [Inc.].  I wanna visit this company so I can see, I can see what happens.  They wanna come out of their communities to see things.  And I think that should be facilitated because maybe they would get more motivated to do that.  And I, I just yearn for us to be, participate more effectively in education.  That's, that's--I think with education, you could do a lot for yourselves that you can't do without education.  Lack of education, weak education, that's a, that's a burden.  That leaves you with a burden from Day One.  And, then with that situation, you are blocked, you are blocked from problem solving and getting the remedy, solutions to things.  I, I say education is the best enabling resource I know.  Money is second (laughter).  Education is first.  I've said that--I said that at Metropolitan State.  You'll see that printed in some of that stuff.  Education is the best enabling resource I know.  And then if you can get education and then you can couple that with hope, on the part of people, then I think we're on our way to--and then, to have--third, if then we could engage with each other, I think we're on our way to a remedy to a lot of our problems.  On Saturday, I participated at the Science Museum, in their African American Science Festival, they call it, the Annual African American Science Festival, and this was the twentieth anniversary of that event at this science museum, and Saturday afternoon, they had what they called 'Science Fusion'.  One exhibit after another on the table, sponsored by companies, and with all these young people participating as low as the age of three years old.  I found myself in line behind a three-year old to test out an exhibit on light dispersion over at the, that 3M [formerly known as the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company] was sponsoring.  And I just that, I thought that was the coolest thing, that whole festival.  And I was just so proud of it, and I think we've got to have more such activities for young people by, in these learning opportunities outside of the academy, outside of the schools to motivate them.  And I never thought that a three-year old could do that, what I saw this little girl doing.  I asked her mom, I said, how old is she?  She said, three.  But her older sister, who's five, had done it before, and her little sister looked at the older sister and did it exactly the same.  She wanted to do exactly what her big sister had done, and I thought about my following my sister along.  And I, I think--and now this was predominantly African American crowd.  It was a cross section, that is, for the young people because they have one for--they have another weekend for Asians and for Asians, science festival.  And then they have one for Hispanics and then they have one for Native Americans.  And the whites are mixed in.  So it was mixed in that regard.  But it was just a wonderful, wonderful experience.  And I think we've gotta--it was eye opening to me.  So we professionals have to get out there and learn what's there.  I have a lot of wishes for our communities because I see a lot of possibilities for making a difference, lots of possibilities.  And I can--in talking about, talking about seven hours, I could talk seven hours on this question.  I've thought about it.  But I think we've gotta--we ought to work at all levels of our society, public policy level, community level, family level, businesses, faith level, churches.  We got to work it at all levels.
Story_ID: 20553
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you've received numerous awards.  I know in 2005, you achieved the--you received the Lifetime Achievement Award in Philanthropy Award from the National Center for Black Philanthropy.  Now, we could--we're not gonna resertate all of them because people can see this when they, you know, when they go to the archive, but when you look back on everything you've done to this point, what, how would you sum up your legacy?
Speaker 2: Okay, I, I would sum up my legacy as having tried to do the best I could do with the resources available to me.  And I put the emphasis on having tried to do the best that I could do.  And that's what I aim to do, frankly.  I don't aim to, for any particular recognition.  I don't aim make a certain discovery, and I, I--I'm, I can set a goal to get a degree or to, to sponsor an event.  I've chaired a lot of galas, fundraising.  I can set a goal to do that, but I'm typically not sure that I have done my very best.  I have done, achieved up to potential.  I, I, my--I want my legacy to be that I have achieved up to potential possibilities.  I, I want to effect the lives of people and enrich the lives of people and improve the quality of life for people, including my community and my family and my friends, community, family, friends.  And I said that my foundation platform was "faith, family, community".  That's sort of the foundation I work on.  I thought a little about this question the other day, and I answered it in the most, in the goofiest kind of way.  And I said, well, if I would die today, what would I want to be on my tombstone?  And I said, I would want it to read something like this, "I have achieved a lot on this earth, and I haven't finished yet."  Now, I'm dead saying that, and why do I put it that way?  Because I want people whom I've touched and worked with to keep on benefiting from those encounters that we had together.  It really makes me feel good to meet people in the community.  I met some this morning at that breakfast who said, you remember that time we met.  And then they go on to tell me what happened from that little, that, that--what I thought was a little encounter or you remember that time you wrote that reference letter for me.  Now, that to me, is just as significant as the picture with Mrs. [Hillary] Clinton [First Lady to President Bill Clinton] up there, going to the White House, meeting with Mr. Reagan and going--so I have had big achievements in my life, and I have had smaller accomplishments.  And I think my real legacy is the impact I have made from both kinds, the small achievements, meeting with the simple things that you do with people, for people, as well as the big thing you should do from your, with your contacts in Washington or the Exxon Mobile Board or the Wells Fargo Board of Directors.  So I want my legacy to state like this, "I have achieved many big things, but I'm not finished yet because I, I want the benefits that I have brought, wherever I was, to be working, to keep on working."  I, I just, you're asking me this question at a time when I'm old, so old now that I've gotten beyond wanting material stuff (laughter).  You know, when you're, you're seeking another kind of gold, G-O-L-D, or diamond.  You say, what's your diamond--what diamond now are you aiming for?  What's that heaven you're trying to reach?  It used to be a dress from Neiman Marcus or some material thing.  It's no longer that, but you want that lasting impact on people.  I think that, I want that to be my legacy.  I thought of writing a book, but, and I might say, well, I want that book to be my legacy.  I want the book to be a project, but I'm not sure that's the legacy that I'm aiming for, the impact it could have on people could be--that's the legacy I'm aiming for.  Now, how do you do that?  You could write a book or you could say, 'yes' when somebody calls you to meet with you, which I'm gonna do next week, meeting with several people.  That simple "yes", Yes, I'll meet with you, talk with you about your frustration, maybe we can, together, come up with some ideas."  That's the legacy, the benefits from that as much as to write a book, which would be very fulfilling because I'm studious and academic.  But that, that's to benefit me.  Knowing that it's gonna benefit somebody else.  That's the legacy that I would reach for.  And I, so I, I will think about this question a lot and be able to answer it more crisply and clearly in the future.  Surely, I enjoy the recognition, and I have gotten a bundle of recognition in my life, and there's more coming.  But on the other hand, the--I would ask what does that recognition suggests?  It suggests something that's special to me because I have a--it suggests that in different kinds of careers, I've been able to rise to the top in terms of my performance, in the eyes of others.  And higher education, I--my performance led to some of the top awards and recognition.  And philanthropy, the recognition I've received represents some of the top award and philanthropy.  And the, and corporate board work, I have received the top national awards, as well as local awards.  And some of my corporate work, I received the top.  So that suggests that I'm coming close to working up to my potential.  That's what that recognition suggests.  So I say to young people, whatever field you go into, and you're going to do different endeavors, it's a pretty good feeling to be able to see one day that you have been able to rise to the top through your own efforts and through the help from others without seeking that particular award, you know.  You were chosen for it.  You didn't seek it.  You were chosen for it because of what others saw from your performance.  That, that's the way I see the recognition on, in my resume and the recognition that comes monthly, you know, from somebody.  It's that, and that's the one lesson my grandmother always said that I'll never forget, "If anything is worth doing, it's worth doing well".  She was illiterate, but that was her way of saying, you've done half--you've done a bad job there.  Do it over again.  If anything is worth doing, it's worth doing well.  These are the words of my grandmother, illiterate, but you know, I have seen that in my more sophisticated work in life.  And I think that maybe that's a great legacy to have if it benefits also somebody else, right.  I'm Baptist, I'm thoroughly Baptist, through and through, and a Baptist minister says all the time, the blessings you receive are to be used to bless somebody else.  That's the legacy I want.  So that's a--I wish I could hear some of the legacies that other honorees have given you.  I, and I hope they have said theirs better and in fewer words than I have said.  But I would put mine that way.  I, I try not--I try hard not to squander opportunity, never, never.
Speaker 1: Okay, we have to pause here.
Story_ID: 20554
Speaker 1: Okay, tell us something about your family.  We haven't talked about your children and so--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, my immediate family here.  Well, we have--let me tell you what it consists of, the way I'm, then you'll know why I'm answering it the way I will.  My husband of fifty years, our two sons, didn't have a daughter, one forty-three, the other one forty-six, and I have to do the math every time I say that because, yeah, the forty-six and forty-three.  One son lives in Atlanta, Georgia.  He's been married.  He's not married now.  The other one lives in Tucson, married, and they have three children--three grandchildren, ages fifteen, soon to be fourteen in February and nine.  And then, my daughter-in-law, wonderful, she and my son have been married sixteen years this past Friday.  They, he's a radiologist, a son, in Tucson [Arizona], a violinist who trained to be in Radiology here at the University of Minnesota Medical School.  And the one in Atlanta [Georgia] went to Morehouse College, a trained mathematician and then went to computer science school and then studied guitar at Berkeley College of Music in Boston [Massachusetts].  So he's a cross discipline person who works in the public school district as the Media Production Specialist.  And my husband and I are just chemists, and both of our sons trained in the sciences.  Well, one in mathematics, the other one in biochemistry, in medical school.  So we all have the science in our DNA [deoxyribonucleic acid], and I think our daughter-in-law, before she married became a computer specialist herself.  My family, we, we have focused on doing things together all through the years, moving together, supporting each other in our various hobbies and modest lifestyle, no fancy housing, and focused on education and staying in touch with home.  All relatives all lived in the South typically, either Birmingham [Alabama] around my husband's family or where he's from or South Georgia, being connected to my family or Washington, D.C. where my sisters lived, and staying in touch with cousins as best we can.  More recently, I've connected very closely to my ninety-four-year old aunt, my father's sister who lives actually in an assisted living place in Poughkeepsie, New York.  And her main caretaker there is my cousin who's the daughter of another aunt on my father's side.  So my husband and I now try to stay connected with her to provide her some support in caring for my aunt.  My, we are a family where mom cooks.  We don't eat out that much, and when I'm not traveling, and we cook soul food and eat soul food, the things we grew up with.  And my husband and I both like public policy.  I'm not a television watcher.  He's a television watcher, and I like to read the newspaper and read the same in the paper.  I'm a reader for the most part, and increasingly, I'm liking my computer because I get so much done on it.  My husband is a chemist but he's also a tinkerer with sort of adventurous streak.  He built a beautiful airplane in our garage.  After we moved here in Minnesota, he worked at 3M [formerly known as the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company] for ten years, and that's when he became connected with a flying club and got introduced to home built planes.
Story_ID: 20555
Speaker 1: Now, these are models or full-sized planes.  Is it a full-size plane or a model?
Speaker 2: A full-fledged plane, it flies and it's sold and it's still flying.  It's, built it from a home-built kit, and I brought a picture of it with me with him standing next to it.  And he took it around and exhibited it at air shows, one air show after another.  And he bought another plane, and he would fly that one down to the Tuskegee [Alabama] air shows.  I tell people I've been to enough air shows to last me for a lifetime.  We used to go to the Oshkosh air show on a regular basis, and that's where they exhibit the home-built planes.  And he--that was a wonderful hobby for him.  He started aviation about forty, forty-two years ago because I was expecting our youngest son and before we moved to Long Island, and he became a pilot.  And that was, I don't think his license is current now, but that's been, that hobby has been a family--so it was something to talk about in the family and something he wanted to do and we can support him with.  I, most of our resources in terms of you would, the little wealth we have, the extra, a lot of it came from my service on corporate boards of directors which I've done now for about thirty-three years, starting serving on the first corporate board in 1978, a company in St. Paul here, New York Stock Exchange listed the H. B. Fuller Company.  After that I went on the Wells Fargo Company board, a much larger company, financially.  And then after that, Minnesota Life Insurance Company and then the Exxon Mobile Company, close to my field, thermochemistry for sure, the petroleum industry.  And then after that Lennox China Company.  So I served on those five public company boards which kept me plenty occupied beyond my regular job, along with, through the years serving on many non-profit company boards.  So I, through experience, gained some expertise in organizational governance, an area that I like very much and now am considered somewhat of an expert in because of service on different kinds of company boards.  So that's become, that's one of my work endeavors, along with caring for my family.  And then keeping in touch with our grandchildren and nurturing them and trying to be supportive to them.  They have school projects too, and I like to go out occasionally to visit them and visit their schools and observe in their classes, to get the--to be able to keep in touch with what's happening in that K through 12 environment.  And now, we're talking to them about, and they're talking to us about what they wanna be when they grow up and college, you know, college, getting ready for college.
Story_ID: 20556
Speaker 1: I truly believe in giving back to the community so my husband and I are active philanthropists in terms of our own giving, family giving to help non-profit organizations and to help different causes in the community.  I learned the benefits of that, great benefits, while we've been in Minnesota.  This is a culture that--there's a strong civic culture here, and I like that part of, this side of this community, and I'm an advocate for it everywhere.  People sharing, people helping each other, and keeping institutions strong and, so that the public would have places to enjoy.  So we sort of take pride, sort of enjoy at the end of the year, us sitting down talking about which organizations we're gonna support and why, and then trying to get as much gift matching as we can.  And that's been a wonderful bonding activity for the two of us and I hope we can pass on that value to our family members, our children.  We have--so our--and I'll stop after I mention the importance of church for us.  We, at this stage, get a lot of satisfaction out of connecting to the faith community, being active with our church and our Sunday school class and having that as one of our social networks.
Speaker 2: What is the name of your church?
Speaker 1: Fellowship Missionary Baptist Church.  I said to someone last week in Washington that I'm--I'm finally discovered that I'm thoroughly Baptist.  So it's American Baptist Church affiliated.  It's Fellowship Missionary Baptist Church here in North Minneapolis.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So that, that is an endeavor which my husband and I enjoy a lot, and when we travel to visit our children like we did Christmas day in Tucson [Arizona], we visit their churches.  We go to church with them.  And that was on--we were in Christmas Eve there, and had we been in Atlanta, we would go to church somewhere there.  We are--that, that's part of my upbringing that has stayed with me, that love for, that connection with the faith community, when, even when I was a student like I said, at the University of Chicago [Illinois].  And now other places we visit.  I, so we put right now, and we have for some time actually put an emphasis on staying healthy.  Health, being careful about our, the health and taking care of the risk factors we have in our family, given what our parents died from.  We, you know, are careful about the physicals and the, try to be careful about the exercises and those things that would give us a good quality of life.  That is, that's become another habit of ours.  So that's our family life, early risers in the morning because we, you know, grew up at four o'clock, going to the field or doing whatever.  We both are just naturally early risers and that is--then we try to plan the day.  And, hopefully, if I'm going to travel, I have, let him know in advance.  We plan that out, and so we just, we have shared values for the most part.  I'll stop there.  What else can I say about family life that--
Story_ID: 20557
Speaker 1: I don't know now.  Is there anything I haven't asked about that you think we ought to cover that we haven't?
Speaker 2: No, I think we have cover the waterfront.  I hinted that, you know, you're--I'm always striving to do things better, and in answering your question here, I'm asking what, what would I like to do better now?  I think, for, and I could have a thing a week probably on this. Probably making sure and keeping in touch with relatives, relatives, cousins, my older sister in Washington, my nieces.  They seem to get a lot of joy out of just hearing, getting a call from you sometimes or a birthday card or something like that.  I, I try to use Sunday afternoon for that.  That's my keep--those are my keep-in-touch, a few hours to do that.  And sometimes I take a break because I say to myself, they got to be better at keeping in touch with me and letting me hear from them and I don't have to take the initiative.  But that, I suppose that I shouldn't say too much because some people just have it in their aptitude to that more than others, you know, just get a certain amount of joy out of it.  I don't--I'm trying to think of my categories over there.  I have indulged in my share of continuing education over the years.  I'll keep on doing that, and that's one of my sermons to younger people, keep educating yourself, keep learning because there are new things all the time, and there are ways you can enhance your own performance if you continue learning.  I have benefited greatly from my international work, travels, by getting the equivalent of another degree from that and are taking a seminar every now and then or doing extra reading on the treadmill and wherever.  But that, that's my own attempt at continuing education.  I, and keeping yourself vital.  That's a word I love, vital, as you grow older.  And so I, and sharing with others.  I meet a lot, I spend a lot of time in meetings with young professionals, whenever they call, you know, or send me an email or in passing, want a business card.  And I, I think there are some things you just don't learn from books, you know, and I learned from engaging with them, and they, hopefully, learned from engaging with me.  So that has become a value, I think another one of the values.  I can't, I can't think of anything more right now.  I just--I could think of the question, "How do you manage time"?  You just manage it.  That's all, the best you can.  One thing, if you don't use it, you're lose it (laughter).  So time management gets to be--which can be a challenge when there are many demands on you.  But I find that it's, managing it well is partly attitudinal too.
Story_ID: 20558
Speaker 1: That is a question, being so busy and then having--you still maintain a kind of a Southern attitude about motherhood and being a wife and all that.  So you cook meals and do all that too.  That must be kind of hard to do, you know.  You have to make sure you have time for yourself, I guess, at some point.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's true.  You want to carve out some time for yourself.  But then I, I have now paused from time to time and asked, what time--what kind of time do I need for myself and why?  I will carve out some time to do a word puzzle on my Kindle.  I love to do that.  That's my main way, that's my refresher.  Now, another way to have time for myself, would be to go down there and browse in the stores.  I'm not one for, I don't enjoy hitting the malls, just going to the malls and browsing like that.  I don't like that.  I don't enjoy that.  There're some people who need time for themselves to do that.  So the question is, what, what kind of time do you need for yourself?  Sometimes I just need some quiet time to think.  And I need to find a room with no television sound, you know, away from the television.  And I--my husband loves to watch television.  So it's not being hostile to him, but I'm finding that because I am busy a lot, just some quiet time is a good way to refresh.  And I, I will seek that out.  So I've--occasionally, we go on a cruise.  And that's been a fun thing.  To see that cruise ship on its side is no--it doesn't encourage you to go on a cruise right now.  But we went to a cruise, on a cruise in Alaska, the Alaska cruise about a year ago, a little over a year ago.  That was so educational that I'm still learning from it.  And I have some fun photos where I kissed a moose, you know, and they took photographs of you kissing a moose.  And I brought one, so that's the, I'm a pretty serious person.  If you would ask, what is the silliest thing you've ever done.  I said, "I kissed moose."  They have a trick for getting that accomplished.  They give you a gram cracker and you put it in your mouth and put it up to the fence, and the moose is eager to get the gram cracker.  The moose gets the gram cracker out of your mouth, and they get a picture of that.  So we, I found that to be a totally relaxing cruise, but educational.  It wasn't the lying on the deck looking up at the sun kind of cruise.  It was just learning from animals and doing things.  But that's, see that's still learning, learning.  I, so the question is, you go through different stages of life.  You can ask what kind of time do you need to refresh yourself and how much.
Story_ID: 20559
Speaker 1: Now, do you keep up with current research in chemistry?
Speaker 2: Current research?  Somewhat, I do--in corporate boards, you know, you do these--they do all kinds of research and you do the site visits.  I don't keep up with the research in my field in the same way, except to, with the analytical chemistry to get a glimpse at how the equipment has changed and the impact of the computer on, in that field.  That was my latest, most studious project.  And I happened to have been talking with a lady who works for a company that sells gas chromatic graphs.  And we talked about, the whole conversation about gas chromatography, 'cause that is the business of her company.  And I--now, she had called me to talk about serving on a corporate board.  She's general counsel at that company.  But we ended up talking about changes in equipment and things like that.  I keep up with it that way, but when I was on the Exxon Mobile board, going out to the facilities and visiting with the scientists and engaging with them around their projects, that was another way to engage with that part of my background again.  I don't go to the American Chemical Society meetings.  You know, that--if I was an active member of the American Chemical Society, but I went to--if I were to attend their conferences and sit through the papers, the presentations, that would, I would keep up with a little more.  I tend to immerse myself in the research with the scholarly work of the field, of the field that I'm working in at the time.  I think that as I've moved into other careers, that's, that's what I have tended to do.  There's a research side of corporate governance, there's a research side of higher education.  And there's a research side of Philanthropy.  You tend to connect more.  Then there's a research side of the hard sciences.  But what I do find, and I, I would like to spend a little time on this, is that the attributes that I learned and the skill set that I learned in the science, I have used it everywhere in all of the other fields.  It's been a foundation, and I, I--in my private thinking, I said, I should get a better handle on that foundation because it certainly has been valuable, and it has paid off.  It, I'm--so that part, say--and talking with young people and young professionals, they--that's a question that they are interested in from time to time.  And I tell people, I never loved chemistry and chemistry never loved me in that I'm thinking science and thinking chemistry all the time.  That's the language that I think in, I think with, often.  And just an example, and I'll stop there, in one of our board meetings for the National Association for Corporate Directors, one of the officers, the program officer was making the report on some credentialing that they were designing, giving people certificates for completing a certain number of courses.  And she said well, the first level of credential will be the silver, and then the gold and then the platinum.  And then she said, a titanium (laughter), and I nearly hit the ceiling.  I said, do you know what that is, that's a metal, metal, that's a hard metal.  And I nearly--I said, go to the periodic chart and look up titanium or you can Google it up and get the properties of titanium.  I said, I think you mean Diamond.  Diamond fits that highest category, but not titanium.  So, and the board nearly cracked up and so did the staff who were sitting on the side.  But, and she was laughing about that last week.  I don't think she would do that again.  When she said, titanium, I equate it with Reatha's name.  But your consciousness about the material sciences and the properties of materials, just instinctively cause you to do that.  Now, it so happens with Delta Airline does use that kind of identification for its sky miles Frequent Flyers.  It's silver, gold, platinum and diamond (laughter).  And this lady who's smart as I don't know what, she came up with titanium.  That's what I mean by thinking science.  I, I, and when I think water, I think H20.  I don't write down water, the word water.  I think H20.  So I think science.  And it's, and in the kitchen I'm careful not to mix Clorox and ammonia.  I said you'd better be watching what you mix here, thinking of the days in the laboratory.  But to answer our question, get back in the research and the sciences, I am more connected to the public policy questions around that, which will be the funding of research in our society today, funding of research.  And then I have notions about that, where the money should come from.  And when people talk about using public dollars for research, my question is, do you leave it all to private hands to fund it and then it become proprietary information there.  The public won't benefit from it.  It means they control who benefits from it.  And I, so I have--I have questions about that.  Shaping of public policy in our society and how we should manage that for the greatest benefit to the public, for the greatest public good.  I'm not ready to out and confront somebody about it, but I do that kind of thinking and connecting with, connection with the research, scientific research, biological and other kinds as well, particularly, the research to support the health sciences.  So, I--so that's my answer to your question there.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, thank you.  I think we'll just go on and do our photos now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you'll have to move from that seat--well, unclip your mic.  We'll want you to sit back here. (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Story_ID: 20560
Speaker 1: (PHOTOS) He'll tell us when he's ready. (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  We're recording.
Speaker 2: Okay, give us a description of this one.
Speaker 1: Okay, that is the, the photograph that National Council--National Association of Corporate Directors chose from a vast number of photographs they have from their meetings.  I'm in a seminar on corporate governance, and it's in Washington, D.C., the National Association for Corporate Directors, and I--
Speaker 2: About what year is this?
Speaker 1: That was about three years ago.  It was about, so it's about 2009, yes.
Speaker 2: And do you remember who this is for the caption.
Speaker 1: And you want the, the gentleman who's sitting next to me is just a colleague, and the purpose--that was used as a recruitment brochure.  That's one of their--recruitment of new members.  So that was the purpose.
Speaker 2: That was taken in 19--that was publication was done while I was, just as I was leaving the presidency of Metropolitan State University.
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety nine [1999].
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety nine [1999], and I left in 1988, and it was Twin Citians for the Year.  That was the, that was the recognition.  It was a surprise but welcomed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That is a commemorative book that was published by the Metropolitan State University Foundation to honor me on my 10th year, 10th anniversary of my presidency of the university.  It is, it covers me, the educator, my roots and my vision.
Speaker 1: Do you know, what year was that?
Speaker 2: That was, the tenth anniversary of my presidency, that was in 19--about 1987?
Speaker 1: Yeah, '87 [1987].
Speaker 2: Eighty seven [1987].
Speaker 1: This photograph is a community service activity.  I gave a speech at an organization in North Minneapolis [Minnesota].  The organization is called the "Cookie Cart", and they were recognizing excellence in student work there over the course of the year and I'm there with the young people and the young lady, the other adult standing up there is, was a nutritionist from General Mills [Inc.] who was a volunteer with that organization.  I came over as head of the foundation.
Speaker 2: Here I am--but her I am presenting the keynote address at the Urban League of Wichita, Kansas.  I believe it was their annual meeting, and the lady sitting here is one of their officers or a fellow participant in the meeting.  And that was something I did regularly, to travel to other cities to help with their community work.
Speaker 1: This, here, I am representing actually the Seaquest Centennial Commission of the State of Minnesota.  The commission was appointed by the governor to plan for the 150th year of statehood, a celebration for the State of Minnesota.  And I'm standing next to the commemorative stamp, prepared and published by the U.S. Postal Service to honor the State of Minnesota, and that's one of my most fun projects because I chaired the initiative to get the stamp done.  I suggested the idea and then chaired the initiative, and it was very successful.
Speaker 2: This is Mrs. Coretta Scott King [wife of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.].  It was the, the occasion was that she came to the Twin Cities to give a keynote address for an event that helped to establish, helped to establish the women's program at Metropolitan State University.
Speaker 1: This is my entire immediate family, my husband on the right, our two sons in the back, our daughter-in-law, Chris, next to--
Speaker 2: Actually, could you start back row, left to right and then first row left to right.
Speaker 1: Okay, sure.  Okay.  This is our entire family from left to right, our oldest grandfather, McKinsey, who is now fifteen, our daughter-in-law, Chris, who is my married to my son, right next to her for sixteen years.  Our son, Jay, oldest son Jay, and then next to him is Scott, our youngest son, and then next to him going to the right is my husband.  And on the front row, we have our darling little grandson, N-Jay, his name is Judge as well, and then here I am in the middle.  And then our daughter, Kala, who's thirteen years old.  We were all at the New York Hilton.  They came to support me when I received a very special award from the ELC in Washington, D.C., the Executive Leadership Council.
Speaker 2: Okay, and did you have a date for that?
Speaker 1: A tape?
Speaker 2: A date?
Speaker 1: Oh, a date, yes.  That was on October 14, 2010.
Speaker 2: Ten, right.
Speaker 1: This is our oldest son, Jay, when he was in high school.  He was the first violinist for the Twin Cities Youth Symphonies, and he was quite a skilled violinist and this is one of their, at one of their concerts.  And that was when he was a high school student.
Speaker 2: This was, this is our whole family again, convened in Hawaii, and from left to right, it's Reatha, myself, and on the--next to me to my left is our youngest son, Scott, and next is our oldest granddaughter, McKenzie, who's now fifteen, and then my husband, Judge, and then N-Jay, our little grandson and Judge too.  And then our daughter-in-law, Chris and then 13-year old granddaughter, Kala and then our oldest son, Jay.  We were all in Maui, Hawaii celebrating mine and Judge's 50th wedding anniversary in, and that was 2011, in 2011.
Speaker 1: This is my, mine and judge's wedding picture and officiating at our wedding ceremony was then president, Benjamin Mays, of Morehouse College.  The date of this was December 16, 1961 on Morehouse's campus in Atlanta, Georgia.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: This is at Clark College, Atlanta, Georgia, Clark Atlanta University on the occasion of my 50th year of graduation from Clark.  That's why I have the golden cap, and that was in 2008.
Speaker 2: This is me as a young scientist, research scientist, at the National Bureau of Standards at Washington, D.C.  This is the cover of their technical news bulletin, which was published on a regular basis.  And the Bureau of Standards is in the New York--in the U.S. Commerce Department.  This is a photograph of me doing chemical experiment in the laboratory there.  Actually, I think that was at the university, at the University of Chicago.
Speaker 1: This is my mother at age forty-two.  She was, had that photo made and one sent to each of her daughters while she lived in South Georgia and Moultrie, Georgia.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Ola Mae Campbell is her name, I should have said that.
Speaker 2: This is Reatha giving a talk at, for one of the community organizations, American--African American Academy for Accelerated Learning.  It is a very active, community-based organization fostering closing the gap in education here in our community.
Speaker 1: About what year is that?
Speaker 2: Beg your pardon?
Speaker 1: About what year?
Speaker 2: About what year?  That was 2010, 2010.
Speaker 1: This Reatha in Atlanta, Georgia visiting one of the schools to try to excite young people about careers and taking their educational opportunities seriously.  And that was, and about--that's for the Atlanta Public School District and about 2007.
Speaker 2: This is the annual legislative conference at the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington, D.C.  One of their special events where the General Mills Foundation presented special grant to help them with the scholarship program.  This was about, in, oh, it was about 2001 or 2001.
Speaker 1: Isn't that Jim Clyburn?
Speaker 2: Jim Clyburn, and the gentleman from Chicago there on the right there.
Speaker 1: Danny Davis [Congressman Danny Davis].
Speaker 2: Then the lady there is the spouse of one of the Congressmen.  He's from Alabama.  He's no longer in Congress now.
Speaker 1: This is James Earl Jones in Minnesota to participate with the Vocal Essence, a community organization that I served on the board of.  And that was, I think that might have been 2000--early 2000.
Speaker 2: This is Malcolm--I think on the back, Malcolm X's daughter.  She was--
Speaker 1: Attallah  (ph.) Shabazz.
Speaker 2: Shabazz, yes.
Speaker 1: Attallah .
Speaker 2: Attallah , Ms, Attallah  Shabazz, yes, it is that.  In the Twin Cities then to give a talk at the Westminster forum, a noon day forum, very successful, and I was one of the host people.  And we were photographed there at a luncheon.  That must have been about 1998 or so.  It was some years ago.
Speaker 1: This is our oldest son, Jay, at his wedding.  My husband and I are featured with him, and this was--he's been married sixteen years last Friday.  So we can do the math here.
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety six [1996].
Speaker 1: It must be 1996 then.
Speaker 2: I think it's on the back (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, it is, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: This is for corporate board meeting in Taiwan for the H. B. Fuller Company.  And these are some of the employees there in the Taiwan facility.  And it's one of the, that was probably 2000 or before then, nineteen--I don't know whether the date is on the back of that one.  There's a little--
Speaker 1: No, it's not here.
Speaker 2: It might be as early as '95' [1995].  I have that.  It would be on my resume because the time I went to Taiwan, I think the date is on there.
Speaker 1: This is Israel, and outside of one of the larger cities, but I went down to give a community-based, give a talk, was traveling for the United States Information Agency, and it was a delightful trip.  And that one was--I could look up the specific, but I traveled that--I would say it must have been about 2000-1988, it would have been 1988, I believe, yes.
Speaker 2: This is my graduation photo from the University of Chicago in 1963.  And it was quite, quite a wonderful, wonderful experience.
Speaker 1: This is a childhood photo.  I was, oh, about seven years old or maybe seven or eight years old, showing myself on the left, with then next to me is a cousin who sometimes lived with us, my mother's sister's son came to live with us when he was two weeks old.  Then next, the tallest one is my older sister, Mamie, and then to her right is my younger sister, Dorothy.
Speaker 2: This is 1958, my senior year at Clark College, Atlanta, Georgia, nearing our graduation time, my last year there.
Speaker 1: This is my father, Willie B. Clark.  I know the photo was made, my estimate is that that photo was made in, as early perhaps as 1960 or before then.  He's deceased.  He passed in 1969.
Speaker 2: This is a photograph from my years at Clark College, 1958 or it might have been '57' [1957]-'58'[1958], a picture with me on the right with two of my professors, Booker T. Simpson on the left who taught me at Clark, chemistry teacher.  Next to him is Avon Kirkland, a fellow student.  I'm seated there, and then next to him is Dr. Alfred Spriggs who was chair of our department of chemistry at Clark and a mentor.
Speaker 1: This is Mount Zion Baptist Church in Pavo, Georgia.  It is the church for our community, and it was also my first school, where I started first grade at age four.  And that is, was the community and family church for my, all of my father's family and my mother's family.
Speaker 2: This shows me with my oldest sister.  I'm on the left.  We are right in front of one of the graduation hall at the University of Minnesota here.  My older sister, Mamie, came up to celebrate the graduation of our son, Jay, from medical school at the University of Minnesota.  And was in about, I can check the year.  It was--it's not on there.  I could find that and get that from Jay.  It was about 19--over 10 years.  I would say that was maybe, oh, '95' [1995].
Speaker 1: Okay, what about this one?
Speaker 2: This is, shows myself on the left, and then our oldest granddaughter who was a little girl at that time, McKenzie, and then Judge, my husband, and then our little grandson, N-Jay, who was about two and a half to three years old.  That was about six years ago at Kenzie's piano recital.  Judge and I went out to Tucson to celebrate that with her.
Speaker 1: This is the--at Morehouse College in front of Martin Luther King, Jr. Chapel.  We were there for the graduation of Scott, our youngest son.  From left to right would be Jay, myself, Scott, and my husband Judge.  And that was I think 1992, I believe.  I can check that more accurately if it's not on there
Speaker 2: And that as at the same time, at Morehouse College, myself, Scott, who as graduating and then my husband, Judge, on Morehouse College campus.
Speaker 1: These are my two sisters and me.  To the left is my youngest sister, Dorothy, then Mamie, my oldest sister and then myself, Reatha.  And that was '81' [1981] at Christmastime.
Speaker 2: Now, is this one that you developed yourself?
Speaker 1: No, that was from my wedding.  That was my mother at my wedding.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).  No, the ones I developed myself has the curliest paper (unclear) (laughter).
Speaker 1: And that was, that's my mother, Ola Mae Campbell at my, mine and Judge's wedding, and that was at, would have been at the, in the chapel at Morehouse College, then for the chapel that's on campus there, 1961. (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION):
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's the Clark yearbook, the 1958, the year I graduated, Clark College.
Speaker 2: Let's get you as Homecoming Queen here.
Speaker 1: Okay, this was, I was the college homecoming Queen, "Ms. Clark" of Clark College my senior year and this was at the coronation ceremony, and I think that was the 1957-'58' [1958] school year. (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION):
