 Wilson  Winkler  Today is April 6, 2012. My name is Latasha Wilson, and I   m with the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State  University Library. I   m in Tipton, Oklahoma, today at the home of Opal  Winkler, who I will be interviewing as part of the Spotlighting Oklahoma  Oral History Project. Thank you for talking with me today. Would you  mind telling me when and where you were born?  I was born in, well, I always say Durant, Oklahoma. I had a sister older  than me, and then, let   s see, I had a little brother but he passed away.  Lillan and Avis. There were three girls, and both of them passed away.  And what   s your birthdate?  January 6, 1919.  And what were your parents    names?  Mother was Emma. Her maiden name, Troxell. Emma Troxell Owens,  and Daddy was Noah.  Noah Owens?  Yes.  So were you born at home?  Oh, yes. Yes. Back then, we didn   t have a hospital or anything like they  have now.  So was it a farm?  Oh, yeah. My daddy was a farmer.  5  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  What kind of crops did he farm?  I suppose cotton back then. I   m not sure. He probably had cattle, too,  though, and he owned his own farm.  How did you help out around the house?  Well, of course, I was little, and Daddy was in bad health, so the doctor  told him he needed to move West. So met up some friends and came in a  covered wagon. We were in a covered wagon. When we got to Altus, we  met up with some friends, they were going to New Mexico. He told  Daddy,    Why don   t we just go together?    So they were in their covered  wagon at Elida, New Mexico, is where they were going. Daddy had  rented out his farm there, and then when we were on our way, well, the  way we would cook, we would have to go out and get cow chips. I was,  oh, I think I must have been about four years old. His name was Holley,  and they said,    Mr. Holley, here   s you a piece of cake.    And I was  calling them cakes. (Laughter) Of course, they thought that was cute of  me.  But you would help gather the cow chips?  Oh, yeah. I thought that was fun, picking up the cow chips. And when  we got to Elida, we got to a wagon yard. The people that owned it lived  next door, and they had a little boy my age and oh, we enjoyed each  other. Of course, we weren   t in school then. And then, Daddy bought a  ranch there and we moved out there. Mother had to have surgery, and  she never was happy there. She wanted to come back with her folks,  where her folks lived, so Daddy, at that time, he got a Model-T truck. I  believe it was a    24 model. I don   t remember, probably a    24 model  truck. We came back to Altus, then, and he rented our place out and then  we just rented a man   s farm. He didn   t buy anything because he didn   t  know what to do. By that time, Daddy wasn   t well and he had a place on  his chin and they said it was cancer, so he thought then that he wouldn   t  live long. He told mother, he said what we should do was move to  Tipton. And of course, Mother had never worked and he said,    You  could open a caf   if something should happen to me.    He always looked  ahead, and that   s why come us to move to Tipton.  Did they know anyone in Tipton?  No.  Why did they choose Tipton?  6  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  I don   t know. Daddy came to Tipton to look for a place for us to move  to. I think he knew someone here. I don   t remember. He went to   he  sells houses.  A realtor?  Yeah, asking,    Is there a place in Tipton that   s for sale?    And he says,     Mr. Owens, there   s a house that is two years old and it has a bath,    and  that was in    30, what year? Anyway.  In the    30s, though?  Oh, yeah, because I finished in    36. I think I was a freshman when we  moved here. Anyway, so it was a two-bedroom house, and my older  sister had married, and it was just Avis, she was younger. This elderly  couple had built it and it was real nice house, but they lost it. He told  Daddy, he says,    There   s several people that   s really wanting this house,  but I   ll sell it to you.    Daddy says,    I   ll pay cash for it.    So that   s how  we moved to Tipton.  I wonder how much he paid for that house?  Seven hundred dollars.  Wow. (Laughter) And where was that? Does it still exist?  No. After, let   s see, I think they moved that house off and built a brick  house where it was. But it   s not in Tipton.  So did your dad stay in good health for a while?  No, not really. No.  Did your mother end up opening a caf  ?  No. At that time, they had sewing rooms. That was during the  Depression, so Mother got a job because she   s a seamstress, too. She got  a job there, and Daddy worked out at the cemetery.  Just tending to the area? Keeping up the area?  Yes.  And that was the Tipton cemetery?  Yes. I don   t know how long he worked there. I don   t think he worked  7  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  too long, but anyway, that   s what they did.  So he didn   t farm in this area?  Oh, no.  Well, what was Tipton like when you moved here?  Well, it didn   t have any of this. It was just a   well, downtown was big.  Have you had any pictures of Tipton back?  Yeah, I   ve seen some.  I think there were three grocery stores.  Was there a movie theater?  Yes. I can just hear this lady, she and her only sister, I guess it was.  They would come out and,    The show is beginning to start     Yell, and  then of course, everybody had a quarter and went to the show on  Saturday night.  Was the town bustling on a Saturday evening?  Yeah. Oh yeah, people would come to town, sit in the car, and watch the  people go by.  So did you walk to school and walk everywhere around town?  Yeah.  How many kids are in your class?  I believe there was thirty-six.  Thirty-six?  I believe it was.  What year did you graduate?     36.  And there were about that many kids in     Well, it was a big class, though, because see, all the farmer   s children  8  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  was, it was a big school.  Did you make friends quickly having moved here in the     Yeah, I can   t think of her name.  Did you play any sports in high school?  No. Oh no.  What would you do for entertainment?  What did we do? Well, we had a radio. This is when I was at home.  What were some of the radio shows you would listen to?  I think it was Wichita Falls, I believe, or something. It   s been so long.  Yeah, I know.  I finished high school and then I married. I have two children, Tyrone  and Sharon. Tyrone  and Barbara Penick  have a boy and a girl, and  each one of them have a boy.  Paige Webb and Jay Penick are Tyrone   s  kids    names.  Sharon and Jimmie  Smith  have three boys and they  finished  college at  Stillwater.  The boys are Bryan, Kyle, and Kullyn  Smith.   Mother was a nurse, too, later, probably after I got out of school. I think  she worked for that doctor.  In Tipton?  Oh, yeah, because when they lived in Durant, the doctor would always  come around and pick her up when a lady was having a baby at home.  Of course, they didn   t go to the hospital.  So your mother would help out with that?  Yes. And then she worked as a nurse here.  Was there just one doctor in town, in Tipton?  Oh, let   s see. Later on there was two, then we had a dentist, too. That   s  when Tipton was really booming. Two doctors and a dentist.  Well, were you aware that there was a depression going on?  9  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  No, not really, because we had a cow here in town. We had a cow and  we had chickens, and Mother would go to the kitchen and make a big  meal out of nothing. Sharon   s just like her, because Mother could sew  and cook. At that time, when we   d get our chicken feed, it would come  in beautiful sacks, and she   d make our dresses out of those sacks back  then. That was back in probably    33 or    32.  What were some of your favorite meals she would make? Did you have a  favorite, like for dinner?  No, not really.  Did she do fried chicken?  Yeah, we had fried chicken.  Did you raise a big garden in Tipton?  Yes. We had a big cellar there at this house, and it was full of all kinds  of canned goods. Now, this was after Avis, my younger sister and I  married, but we   d come home and Mother said,    Now, what vegetables  do you want?    I wanted beans and she wanted peas. Mother said,    Now,  each one of you get what you want, get both.    (Laughter) We had  canned goods. She was a very active, jolly person.  Did your parents talk much about politics?  No. If so, it wasn   t around me. We were just a happy family.  Did you play any musical instruments?  No.  Were your parents involved with the church?  Yes.  The Church of Christ, or     It wasn   t at that time. It was made up of the members of the church.  Well, what would your parents do for fun? Did they get together with  friends and play games or anything?  I don   t remember them getting together and playing games. It   s been so  10  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  long ago.  But then later, you would get together with friends and play.  Oh, yeah, Billy and Aubrey, and John and I, we   d have the best time.  Playing Forty-two?  Oh, yeah. Playing Forty-two. Let   s see, it was in    81. I started to work at  the REC. Sharon was just a baby. I think she   s sixty-five, and I think she  was just a few months old.  What   s the REC?  The Rural Electric  Cooperative . What year did Rural Electric start? I  think about ten years, but anyway, they hired me out there and I worked  thirty-six years at the Rural Electric. They just made a place for me, I  guess, from the very bottom. (Laughter) When the meter cards would  come in, well, I would record, and I worked up until I was an assistant  accountant.  Wow.  Lura  Fay Van Scoder  was the main  accountant . Of course, I knew it  from the bottom, see, because I had worked up in all the positions.  So what year did you retire from that position?  Well, the reason I retired, we built the house in back of Mother and  Daddy, and then from that house    We had John   s Auto Parts at Altus.  He built that and then, we built that house, and then John   s Auto Parts,  and then we built this one. I don   t remember what year, this house.  Well, Tyrone worked at the store, my son, he came back. John would  take off on Saturdays, and of course, I didn   t have to work on Saturday,  and that was the day that we   d go and do what we wanted to. We   d  always go to Lawton and eat. When we were going to Lawton on the  county line, over as you go to Snyder, a man was a farmer, he was  coming across and he pulled out in front, just came right in front of us.  We had a wreck and John was killed. I was in and out of the hospital for  a year. They wanted me to come back to work, and I said no. I just  couldn   t.  What year was that?     81, I believe.  11  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Did you sell Mary Kay?  No.  Oh, you didn   t. Okay.  No. All I   ve ever done is worked at the Rural Electric.  You just live on Mary Kay drive. That   s it.  I enjoyed my work. I loved it. Seemed like it was just one big family out  there.  That   s great. Well, how has Tipton changed over the years?  Oh, well, all of my friends have passed away or moved away. Lura and  Elton Van Scoder are the only close  friends left  that  we ran  around  with. The rest of them have either moved away and new people have  moved in. The church is the only place that I go. Sharon and Jim are  gone on a trip. John and I traveled a lot. We have gone from coast to  coast both ways, and we   ve been overseas three or four times.  Well, what kept you in Tipton all these years?  After he passed away?  Well before, or after.  Well, of course, working, and I had a good job. John was, that   s when  things were really booming.  Was he from here?  Humphreys.  Just down the road a ways. And what was his profession?  Auto. John   s Auto Parts is what he did.  Yes, in Altus. So did both of your children graduate from Tipton High  School? And they   re both near here?  Yeah. Tyrone lives at Altus. Of course, he   s retired, too. I just can   t  believe. And Sharon. Of course, Sharon is so young looking. She   s just  another Mother. Jolly. She has a business, now. She has two big  12  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  embroidery machines, sewing machines. Have you seen?  I think I have, last time I was here. What do they do, though?  Oh, he farms. He has several farms.  But her machines, what does she do for people?  Well, makes caps.  Monogramming?  Oh, yeah, everything. All that. Oh, I tell you, she had over a thousand  caps this year that we have made, and I would finish them out, and then  she would burn them all to seal it, if you know how they do. But she  does beautiful work. She got a job in Altus, and this man at Altus called  her and said he would like for her to come over, oh, it   s a big outfit there  at Altus. He says,    I would like to talk to you about your work.    And  when she went over, he said,    I was at a sale and I picked up one of your  caps and your address was in it.    See, we put her address. He said that  was the most beautiful cap he had ever seen.  Wow.  She got over two thousand dollars    worth of business with caps and  jackets. I don   t know what all.  That   s wonderful. So she   s a new business owner in Tipton.  Yes. She stays busy.  Well, where do you buy your groceries? Do you shop at the store  downtown?  I don   t cook anymore. I go out to Sharon   s, she always cooks for me.  Now I eat breakfast, and of course, when we   re at Altus, well, we   ll  drive over there. We   re lucky to have this little store, though. That man  is so nice. He   s not making any money, but he says,    I   m staying open  just to help Tipton.     Where do you get your hair done?  Bobby Lawson here in Tipton.  Well, what does Oklahoma mean to you?  13  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  It   s home. Home sweet home is Oklahoma. Because I   ve been into a lot  of states and     This is your favorite?  Yes. And during the war, we traveled from coast to coast, following my  husband. I had Tyrone then.  So was your husband in the military?  Yes. I guess all the young men were, and so was he. I know he said there  were a lot of younger men than him and they had little ones, and he was  the first group that left Altus. So when the war was over, of course, they  were the first ones to get to go. He said,    No, there   s a lot of young boys  here that have young wives, and I   ll stay.    He was that kind of person.  Well, what are some of your hobbies these days?  Really, what I enjoy the most is working in my yard.  And that   s how I found you today. Trimming the bush. (Laughter)  I do my own housework and my own yard work. I   m ninety-three years  old, but I enjoy it.  Well, that   s wonderful.  Oh, and that house over there looks terrible.  I bet that drives you crazy.  And this one over here.  Well, yours looks amazing.  This house over here that burned, they had   I don   t know really how to  say it. Anyway, that was a filth house that burned. Just accident. They  had just remodeled it and fixed that up and bought brand new furniture  and don   t know how it caught fire or anything.  Was anyone hurt?  No.  Well I   m glad it didn   t spread over here. That   s scary.  14  Winkler  Wilson  Winkler  Wilson  Well, Sharon was out there and, of course, everybody out here was there  and you probably don   t know him, he   s a young boy that volunteered at  the fire department. He was here visiting, and his mother says,    I   m  afraid those sparks are going on her house, and with those wood  shingles, it   ll be gone.    He says,    I   ll take care of that.    So he went  down and got the water truck. And he put all that water on my house or  it would have burned, because the wind, it was at night, and the wind  was blowing sparks.  Well, is there anything else we should talk about?  I miss your grandmother. I just miss her sometimes. Oh, we had a good  time. That was, see, like, there at church, it   d couple off. Lura and Elton,  and let   s see, who was the other couple? The Kellys. When we four  would get together, but that   s the way that we   d want to go. Your  grandmother and granddaddy, John and I, we had Saturdays, we   d take  off. We went to Lubbock once and we spent the night, and we just had  such a good time and played Forty-Two, and oh     Lots of fun adventures together. Well, it has been wonderful talking with  you.  -------  -------
