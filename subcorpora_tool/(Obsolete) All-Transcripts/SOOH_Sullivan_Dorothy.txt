 Little Thunder  Sullivan  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is February 1, 2012.  I   m in Norman, Oklahoma, with artist Dorothy Sullivan. Dorothy, you   re  a Cherokee artist who has worked as a teacher and commercial artist,  evolving a style that can be poetically realistic or decorative by turns,  which always has a place for a certain spirituality. Thank you for taking  the time to speak with me today.  Thank you.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  I was born in Seminole, Oklahoma. I grew up all around in Oklahoma.  How many brothers and sisters did you have?  I have one sister.  And what did your folks do for a living?  Well, my dad, he started working in the oil fields when he would have  been in the eighth grade. They moved to Seminole, so that   s where our  family started. Then later, he worked as an insurance salesman and was  pretty much self-educated, so I was pretty proud of him.  Your mom was a homemaker?  She was until I was in high school, and then she started working as a  sales lady in a department store, and she loved that. My dad was the  Cherokee. He used to sit in the porch swing with my sister and I on each  side, and he would sing to us and play the harmonica. Then he would tell  us about being Cherokee and some of the family history and how we  should be proud of being Cherokee.  5  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  His folks had already passed on?  His mother passed away when I was six. She was one of my favorite  people when I was little. She always lived close to us.  What are some of your memories?  She always had hugs. She was really short. She looked Cherokee, and  she was fluffy, I guess. (Laughter) I remember her holding me and  rocking me and singing to me.  Did she ever sing in the language?  I don   t remember that, if she did or not.  What is your earliest memory of doing art?  I started drawing before I went to school. I remember one of my  mother   s sisters trying to show my sister and I how to draw something  when we were driving somewhere. I don   t know where we were going. I  was just fascinated and was able to draw what she did. That   s when I  started. From then on, that was just what I did.  Were any extended family members artists, as well?  No. No, just me. (Laughter)  Did you have experiences with art in primary or secondary school?  No, not really. The first art class I had, I was a senior in high school.  Before that, I just self-taught.  But you had discovered that you could draw something that looked like  what you were drawing?  Yes. It was easier in a lot of ways. I was so right-brained and left-handed  that it was easier for me to draw something than just talk about it or to  say something.  When you were doing these drawings around the house, did you have  plenty of materials?  No, not a lot. I had some, but just anything I had, I worked with.  What were your folks    reaction?  6  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  They liked it. They were encouraging. My mother, especially,  encouraged me.  You got into high school, and you had an art class. What did you learn  in that class?  The instructor was the college art teacher at East Central University  because our high school was part of the teacher training program, so we  got to take a few classes, go across the street to the university. I did my  first piece of sculpture there.  With what materials?  Clay, and I liked that. I did my first oil painting, which I was thrilled  with that. I liked the class. I made good grades, but I just didn   t like that  part. I just liked doing the pieces, but I didn   t like the assignments. I  guess I   ll put it that way. (Laughs) I liked doing my own.  What was your least favorite assignment?  I think a craft project. I can   t even remember what it was.  When did you decide that art was something you wanted to explore?  Seemed like I just always knew that that   s what I wanted to do. I grew  up in the    50s in southeast Oklahoma, and everybody, all the kids, we  expected to get married when they graduated. My family didn   t have  money to send me to college, so I just dreamed about it. I didn   t really  plan on it. I got married right out of high school and had four little boys.  It was kind of a tough time then because we lived in Ada. If you didn   t  have a lot of education, you were a fifty-cents-an-hour person. My  husband worked in a service station for fifty cents an hour. Pretty tough  times, so he was in and out as far as the home. Finally, my sister  graduated from college. She got a scholarship to go as a teacher. She  encouraged me to try for that to take care of the boys. It was a pretty  emotional time because the thought of welfare and that kind of thing just  horrified me.  By the time you were in high school, or even before you started to  college, had you been exposed to any Native art?  Not very much. Not very much. I didn   t really see any difference  because   when I was really exposed to that was when I moved to  Konawa, Oklahoma, after I   d been teaching for a while. There were a lot  7  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  of Native American kids in my classes, and they were interested in doing  their type of art, so I started one of the first Indian art programs in the  state at Konawa. The kids had a choice. If they wanted to be in the  Indian program, that was fine if they were Native American, but one  requirement was they had to give a report by interviewing at least one  elder. They had to learn about their tribe. If they were Creek, they  couldn   t do tipis, that kind of thing. They had to learn about their tribe  and give reports on that as well as their artwork and why they were  drawing this, trying to help them not just copy some of the Native art but  to help them develop their own style of that, which was a lot of fun.  Then I had a four-year planned art program for the other part. I had to  work in the things that the Native kids needed with their program. It was  a lot of fun, and at the end of that year, there was an art show contest at  East Central University. Both art groups went, and they both won a lot  of awards. They really liked the principal. They came back, and a  representative of each group took their awards and dumped them on his  desk. (Laughter) We had an art show at the end of the year. The kids had  never had one before, and it was pretty exciting. They loved it.  That   s really innovative. I want to go back and then come and pick up  this topic again. When you went through college to get your teaching  degree, did you also have a minor in art? Was it with the thought of  teaching art?  My major was in art education, and then I had another major in history  because I loved history. At first, I thought I wanted a degree in industrial  arts because I loved designing anything, houses, furniture, anything. I  took one drafting class. I was born in the wrong time. (Laughter) I did  well, but if I asked one question, I had all these guys over here trying to  help me do it. I thought,    Okay, we   ll go for a different major.    (Laughs)  It was because you were a woman. It was unusual for a woman to be in  their classes.  I was told by a counselor that I wouldn   t be able to get a job teaching  industrial arts because I was a woman. That was in the    50s. Things are  different now. (Laughter)  Yes, fortunately. You got a good foundation as you were taking that art  education program? You got more of a foundation than you   d had in  high school.  I got a very good one. I had two very good instructors at East Central at  that time. They really taught the basics of how to draw, how to see, how  to imagine, all these things that I think are important. I think drawing is  8  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  the basis of it, so when I started teaching, that became the basis of my  program to help the kids. I had a poster that I had up in my room.    In  order to do your art, you need to learn how to see, how to think, and how  to feel, and combine all those things into your own expression.    That  was the fun of it, especially with high school, trying to work with each  kid individually and help them develop their style, not just copy, but  they learned the basics first.  By the time you ended up at Konawa, what time period are we talking  about?  Seventy-five, seventy-six. I graduated from the university in    66.  There had been some reforms in Indian education, but you pretty much  singlehandedly had decided that you were going to take that approach in  your art program.  Yes. When I started that at Konawa, I met with some of the Native  parents and got all the information that I could find to try to make it  what I thought it should be, and tried. Then every year, I worked on it if  I had a Native in my class. When I went to Tahlequah, I did the same  thing. I had a Native art program.  You sort of implied that the principal was perhaps not crazy about the  idea at first, or was he always supportive of that?  He was. He was supportive.  After you started this Native art program, are you then going to Indian  art shows or continuing to paint on the side?  I painted on the side. Where I got interested in doing my own Native  art   I had always just kind of taken for granted about being Cherokee,  but as far as trying to express that, I didn   t that much. My dad was killed  in a car accident in his fifties. There   s two things that caused me to start.  One was thinking of a way to honor him. Another is I went to the Trail  of Tears Art Show just to view it. I think it was 1980, in the    80s. I was  so thrilled by all of the art and the artists, and I just had a very emotional  feeling that,    This is what I need to do.    So after my children were  grown up, I retired from teaching and started in 1990, I think, full-time.  You did study under Fred Olds, who   s a well-known     No, I really didn   t study under him. He was just a mentor. When I was  teaching at a little town called Perkins, teaching art     9  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Because you went to Konawa to Hennessey and then to Perkins?  No, I went to Hennessey then Konawa. Anyway, I also was the gifted  teacher for the high school, and so I tried to find mentors for some of the  kids who were in that program. I had one kid that was a cowboy kid, and  he was the neatest kid and very talented in his artwork. I contacted Fred  Olds. Didn   t know him or anything, but just for the kids, you know. He  said,    Come over, and we   ll talk,    so I did. Went to his studio, and I told  him all about the kid, and I was all excited. He said,    All right, now let   s  see your work.    I did, and then that summer I ended up going to Guthrie  every day and working in the studio there with him and a couple other  artists.  Was it an official workshop or were you just     Nope, just a little gallery he had and studios upstairs. It was a lot of fun.  That   s when I started really showing with him. He had cowboy and  Indian artists. One really good friend I had that was also a mentor was  Jerome Bushyhead. Those two are the ones who really said,    Now, you  need to go for this.    I was scared to death, but I did it.  Encouraged you to think about doing it full-time.  Yes.  In Hennessey, I   m thinking you probably did not keep up your Indian art  program. You didn   t have enough students.  No, we moved up there, and it was a whole different population. A lot of  them were farmers, wheat farmers and oil field workers. A lot of the kids  were German or German-type background, so they weren   t as interested  in that. When I moved, I moved to Perkins, and there were Native  Americans there. From there, I went to Tahlequah, and we worked on it.  What medium did you start out in? I guess you   d been experimenting in  school, but what did you choose?  I liked everything. I liked drawing. I did a lot of pencil drawing, colored  pencil. Then I mixed it with watercolor. But my favorite forever was oil.  When I got to where I had to hurry and get something finished for the  shows   because being an artist is a job. It   s a lot of work and sometimes  stress, trying to get ready for the shows, so I would switch to acrylic so I  could get it done faster. Wasn   t my favorite. (Laughter)  I remember seeing you, though, at art shows maybe in the mid-   80s.  Once you   d had that Trail of Tears experience, were you visiting more  10  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  shows and talking to Indian artists?  In the late    80s, yes.  Who were some artists you especially admired and especially liked their  work?  A lot of them. (Laughs)  I think Daughters of the Earth were painting around the mid-   80s, the  mom and sisters, and Mary Adair and Virginia Stroud.  I saw some of Virginia   s work, and I liked it. I   m trying to think. Of  course, Donald Vann, I liked his work. Your husband  Merlin Little  Thunder , I liked his work a lot. (Laughter) Gosh, there   s so many.  Did you get any business tips from anybody when you started out, from  any artists?  Yes, Jerome was pretty good about telling me,    You should do this or  that,    and that helped. So was Fred. Before I started the Cherokee art, I  did a lot of Western art, too, because I loved history. I   d put all this  together.  When I started the Cherokee art, I had what my dad had told me, but I  did a lot of research, not just books but talking to elders, to people both  in Oklahoma and in North Carolina and Georgia because I would go  back there. Then I got to where I could have shows at the museum in  North Carolina. Tried to go every year for a while. That helped a lot, and  then working with the museums, as much as I could get out of them. I  worked with them.  To go in and you might ask to see certain artifacts and sketch?  Right, and learn as much as I could about the culture and history.  Which museums?  There was two in Cherokee, North Carolina, that I really liked. There  was some in Georgia, and I can   t think of the name now. The Cherokee  Heritage Center in Tahlequah. Also did research on my family,  Cherokee family. All that was really interesting and fun.  When you first went to North Carolina, started visiting Eastern Band  Cherokee people, did you and your husband go together? How did that  unfold?  11  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  I got an invitation to come to Asheville, North Carolina, to a show.  Because they had that Indian art show for a couple of years.  I think it was more than that. I went several times. Then we would go up  to the Cherokee reservation after and spend a week there. Then I made  several friends who were full-blood Cherokee that I always looked  forward to seeing. A lot of them painted. I really enjoyed going there  every year.  In terms of your trips to Georgia, which is where your Cherokee family  is from originally, what are some moments that stand out for you?  All I had to go on was what my dad had told me about the family  coming from there to Oklahoma, so it   s really strange. I had two distant  cousins that I   d never heard of before that contacted me and invited me  to Marietta, Georgia.  How did they get a hold of you?  They just saw my work. I went there and got acquainted with both of  them. One of them, he   s like a local historian, and so he was a lot of fun.  He wrote a column every week for the local paper. He took us up on the  mountain north of Marietta where my Cherokee family lived. Well,  there   s several generations, but one of them lived at what used to be  called Allatoona Town. It was a Cherokee town before the Trail of  Tears. It   s now part of Red Top Mountain State Park.  We got to go and see where he lived. His sister and his son actually  came on the Trail of Tears from Georgia, but he was killed by the  Georgians. They were south of the Chattahoochee River, south of  Atlanta. The Cherokee land was north, and our family lived close to the  Chattahoochee on the Cherokee side.  Before the Trail of Tears, when the gold was discovered, people were  wanting to take Cherokee land for that. They even passed a law that the  Cherokee could not mine gold even on their own land. (Laughs)  Anyway, they would send these marauders, people that would come and  raid some of the Cherokee farms and things. Young Deer was my  ancestor   s name. He went down by a little creek near the Cherokee town  to pray every morning. He was a Christian. His sister found him there.  He   d been shot, and so that was his story. She came on to Tahlequah and  lived there. Young Deer   s son was called Indian John. He came on the  Trail, but he ran away and went back to Georgia and hid up in the  mountains north of Marietta and worked as a blacksmith. We have a lot  12  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  of fun stories that I got from them, and how his sons fought for the  Confederacy in the Civil War and all that. It   s kind of fun.  How did it impact your art, that kind of really direct experience?  Encouraged me. I had always been interested in western history and  Indian, especially that. The Cherokee, when I actually got to go back  there, the first time that we drove into the Smoky Mountains, I couldn   t  keep from tears. It was so emotional. It   s hard to explain, but I   ve heard  there are a lot of other people who do that when they go back there. It  was hard to explain, but it was like you were going to your home.  What   s an award that you won early in your career that was important  to you?  The first time I entered the Trail of Tears art show, I had no thought of  winning, and I won first in the Trail of Tears. It was a real shock.  (Laughs)  Do you want to explain that category a bit?  The Trail of Tears category is where you do a painting that expresses  what happened on the Trail of Tears, which was the forced movement of  the tribes to Oklahoma.  What was your image?  It was just a young Indian girl. She has on blue jeans and a t-shirt, and  she   s got her thumbs in her pockets, and she   s acting kind of tough, you  know. Behind her is a memory circle, which became my symbol. Inside  of that is the people on the Trail. It   s like,    Don   t forget your heritage.  Some of these changes are not that great.    (Laughter)  You   ve spoken a bit about encountering prejudice sometimes as a  Cherokee artist because you maybe weren   t as identifiable as some  other people. Was that from other Indian artists or non-Indians or a  mix?  I really didn   t even think about it when I went into it because I felt so  strongly that I was supposed to do it, but, yes, I did run into some of  that. Most of the ones who were verbal about it were white people who  came to the shows, and they would say,    You don   t look Indian.    I said,     Well, I are one.    (Laughter) It   s funny. There are some, usually full-blood  people   I never had anyone ever question it. The only ones that I  really noticed were either white or part white. My dad looked like one,  but I just happened to not get the darker skin. (Laughter) Some of my  13  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  sons are. It doesn   t bother me one way or the other because I just felt  that I had a purpose for my painting and it   s what I did.  You weren   t as immersed in the gallery scene as long as some people,  but what changes did you notice, I guess from the   90s, when you really  started being active with galleries?  I did some galleries. I didn   t a whole lot.  You focused on your shows more?  Yes, I   d rather have gone to the show and sell my work myself because,  as you know, the gallery takes quite a chunk out of the money. That part  was kind of hard at first, but as I got older I decided to work with one or  two galleries because it is very expensive to go to the art shows, travel  and show fees and all that. It balances out.  Of course, you were having a museum show back east for a while. Do  you think your market is more in Oklahoma or outside of Oklahoma?  It   s all over. The gallery I work with now, there   s collectors from  different places. Oklahoma, yes, but they   re all over. There   s one in  Connecticut, several different places.  Your two galleries, are they both in Oklahoma?  Both. Tribes Gallery here in Norman and then the Cherokee Gift Shop  and Gallery in Tahlequah are the only two. I sell my prints and cards and  things all over.  Do you sell from a webpage, too?  Yes.  What was your first sale or a sale that was very exciting to you?  Actually, this was when I was going to college. I went to college, all of  it but one year at East Central in Ada, but one year I went to  Southeastern. That fall, my boys and I were by ourselves and really  needed some money. We had a little show at the school, at the art school  at college, and I sold a painting. I was so thrilled  That was my first real  sale. I went and spent every penny at the grocery store. (Laughter) That  was the most important sale, I think.  Right. Well, 1999 was kind of a banner year for you because you were  Honored One at Red Earth. Is that right?  14  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Yes.  Best of Show at Red Earth, and here you   ve only been really painting  full-time for about nine years when this happened. Starting with Best of  Show, what was your image for that, and what did that award mean to  you?  Well, I didn   t win Best of Show at Red Earth. I won at the Cherokee  Museum show. That  gesturing  was my piece, She Speaks for Her Clan,  which was about our seven clans of the Cherokee. The models were all  real ladies from the clans they represented.  Wilma Mankiller was one of those models.  She represented the Blue Clan, which was one of her grandmother   s  clans. That   s become my signature piece. It   s been in so many  publications and things, including Time Life Books, the Smithsonian.  Do they have the original at Tsa La Gi Museum  in Tahlequah ?  No, it   s at the Museum of the Cherokee Indian in Cherokee, North  Carolina. The Eastern Cherokee bought the site of what they call the  mother city, Kituwah. It   s in the mountains out there close to Cherokee,  North Carolina. They are in the process of restoring that mother city into  a museum complex, and they said that painting is going to go there, so  I   m very thrilled about that.  One of my Cherokee friends, Tommy Wildcat, went to Cherokee, North  Carolina, with us even way before they bought that painting. Some of  the full-blood kids took him to that site, and at that time, just a little bit  of the mound was there, and it was part of a farmer   s field. On the way  home, he took my husband and I by there. We had to walk down this  little hill, across a railroad track and everything. We got there, and it was  a beautiful little valley that was ringed with the Smokies. Very  emotional for both of us.  I filmed him for a report for one of his classes at Northeastern  University. He got up on top of the mound and was talking about it.  Then when I shut the camera off and he came down, he had tears. He  said,    Someway, somehow, this has to be brought back.    Well, they   re  working on it now. It   s very important to a lot of people. I   m looking  forward to that. I hope I get to see it.  It   s kind of proof how art and social change interweave.  15  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  I used to teach a class called Drawing as a Second Language. Art, it   s  the best, I think, way of communicating that there is because you don   t  have to have language. People remember the picture more than they do  the words. I really think that art is so important for Native people or any  people to preserve their heritage and their culture and their history.  You did win an award in    99 at Red Earth.  Yes, first in drawing.  Was that with a bark drawing?  No, that was at Five Tribes, a painting on tree bark. The one at Red  Earth was a pencil drawing. It   s    Praise the Lord    in Cherokee. It   s three  ladies, three generations, and they   re singing hymns in Cherokee. They  posed for me at the museum. I took a lot of pictures of them and then did  a pencil drawing, and that was it.  Honored One, that   s a special award. It   s not just for achievement.  I know. I could not believe it when they called me and told me that I was  to be the Honored One that year at Red Earth. They select one artist each  year (and they   re all different tribes all across the United States) to be  the Honored One. That was like the Academy Award to me. (Laughs) It  was wonderful. Then the next year, I was named Master Artist at the  Five Tribes Museum. It was just a huge, huge year. (Laughter)  You   ve done several one-woman shows. A solo show is hard, I think,  anyway, but what   s the challenge of doing one?  I enjoy doing them. I had one at the Red Earth Museum in Oklahoma  City. I   ve had several in North Carolina at the museums. Lots of  different places. Tulsa, had one there. I believe it was Gilcrease.  Did you prepare for a whole year?  Well, that was before I was selling as much, so I had some, and then I  worked quite a while. Now I   ve sold all my originals, so I really have to  work to get something done.  Well, we   re going to get to look at one, so that   ll be great. I know your  husband, George, has passed on now, but what was his contribution in  terms of this is sort of a two-person business?  It really is. He was a minister, and then he retired because of health. He  was always, from the beginning, very encouraging with my artwork and  16  Little Thunder  Sullivan  helped any way he could. When I decided to try to go full-time, we sat  down and talked about it. I said,    I   ll do the art. What are you going to  do?    (Laughter) So he did all the business part, which is a lot. He taught  himself to do all the matting and framing. He got to where he could cut  real fancy mats and all that stuff, thank goodness. (Laughter)  Another thing, I had a very difficult time trying to use the mat cutter  because I   m left handed and it   s set up for a right-handed. So after he  passed away, I finally got up the courage and tried to use my right hand,  which is retarded, to try to cut. I finally can do it, but not near quite as  good as he did. (Laughter)  The best contribution he did was encouragement, just being there when I  was working on a painting. Sometimes he   d just kind of sit and watch  me paint, and it helped. That   s one thing that I really miss now. I think  artists need a spouse to be there and just to help them keep going.  Another thing, I think artists are the worst business people in the world,  so they need that support. (Laughs)  You were contracted by the National Park Service to do a painting of the  Trail of Tears that was going to be placed at a dispersal center. Can you  explain what a dispersal center is, and then tell us a little bit about what  you did?  Well, there were seventeen, I believe, different detachments that came to  Oklahoma, of Cherokees. There was anywhere from five hundred in a  detachment to fifteen hundred or so. When they got here, there were  sites set up. There were several, but there was two that were the main  ones. One of them was near Stilwell, and the people would go there. The  wagon train would come in, and there would be government contractors  or people who were in charge of giving supplies out. Each family would  get one month   s worth of supplies. That would just be flour, maybe  some hog meat or something like that, a little bit of coffee, a little bit of  sugar. It wasn   t a whole lot, and corn. Every month, they would have to  come back. They were given rations for a year, so they   d have to come  back every month to get their supply while they were trying to find a  home site, put in a garden or a crop. It was a pretty tough time.  The National Park Service, they are putting these historical markers up  at several of the sites. The first one that I did was Mrs. Webber   s  Plantation, which, I think, the majority went to that one. There were  several different groups of Cherokees that came to Oklahoma. The first  ones came, they were the Old Settlers. They came before the others did  and had already settled and set up their own government. Then the  second group was the Treaty Party, who were considered traitors by  some of the majority that were still in the old Nation. And then the Trail  17  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  of Tears group.  Mr. and Mrs. Webber had a plantation set up where the site of Stilwell is  now. In fact, their home site is now part of the Stilwell cemetery. I went  out and took a lot of pictures in all directions from where the home site  was. There   s a little hill that   s down here, and the stream, below the site.  I thought,    Well, if my family had just gotten their rations        A lot of them had to hang around the site because they didn   t have  anywhere else to go. Some of them had old ragged tents and things like  that, but I thought,    Well, I would want to go down and grab that site by  the creek.    So I have a family that   s there, and they   re cooking and  setting up their stuff. Then, way in the background is Mrs. Webber on  her porch, and all these wagon trains coming in, and people standing in  line to get their stuff. This was special to me because my grandmother   s  Cherokee allotment land was just north of the edge of Stilwell and not  far from that site. It meant a lot to me to be able to do that.  Are you active with the Cherokee Artist Association at all?  I haven   t been. I would like to be, but it means driving to Tahlequah for  the meetings. When my husband was ill, that was impossible to do. Now  it   s a little hard to go, but I would like to.  What do you see as some of the benefits of being in an association, an  artists    association?  I think just supporting each other, encouraging each other. That   s good.  That   s another thing that was good about going to the shows, was just  visiting with the other artists and being able to encourage each other and  share.  Good interaction. It gets kind of lonely sometimes, doesn   t it?  Yes.  How has your color palette changed over the years? I know it depends  on whether you   re working in acrylics or oils.  Well, I pretty well just use a basic palette, just earth colors.  Do you think it   s gotten lighter or darker?  No, it just depends on what I   m working on.  You mentioned that you like to draw. Do you do a lot of preliminary  18  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  studies before you do a painting?  Not a lot. I used to do, not as much anymore, a detailed pencil drawing  before I would do the painting.  I see. And then once you   ve done your drawing, paint directly on the  board or canvas?  Yes, I usually transfer an outline of the drawing but not the drawing  itself. The reason I do the drawing is, first of all, the composition and  design. The second thing that I think is important is the shading, the light  and dark, determining where the light   s coming from and all that. I think  it   s important to get those two things before you start putting the paint  on there. (Laughs)  When you   re working with acrylic, are you working on canvas or a  board or both?  Both.  How often do you do oils anymore?  It depends what I   m working on. If I have something I have to finish in a  hurry, I use acrylic. I started doing a lot of dancing turtles for fun. When  I need to get one of those done, (they   re usually in a hurry and for fun)  those are acrylic or watercolor.  Family interactions are a strong thread of your work. What do you try to  convey with those images?  Well, I just really think that family is very, very important. I have five  sons, and they   ve been my life. I have a large extended family from  them, so I think that family is very important, love of family, support of  family. I try to show that.  Another thing, I   ve painted a lot of women, strong women. I think that  was a part of the Cherokee and a lot of other Native people, the respect  and love for their women as well as the depending on the strength of  their women. That   s something I   m kind of proud of, so that   s what I  was trying to show with that.  You use live models, and you take photographs. Will you also do on-site  studies, have somebody sit or stand?  Just stand there and pose for me? Sometimes, but not as often because  it   s so hard to get people to do that. Sometimes I can grab a family  19  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  member, but sometimes it   s easier to work from   I don   t just copy a  photograph. A lot of times I will take two or three or more and work  from that to do the person, so it   s not just a copy of a photograph.  Is the same true when you   re doing a landscape? Are you working  straight from the photograph as much as you can?  Well, if I can, I   d rather work from the place. On this painting we were  talking about a while ago, Mrs. Webber   s Plantation, I took a lot of  pictures a lot of different ways of the site, and then I worked from that.  There really wasn   t any way just to set up and paint there. I did most of  that from  photos  and remembering the site. A lot of it is in your head.  You   ve talked about the kinds of research you do for your paintings.  How important is humor in your work?  I think it   s important. I think emotion is very important. Trying to  portray a feeling or an emotion, that   s part of the communication of the  art, whether it   s humor or something else. I like to try to show strength,  love, some humor, especially with the turtles, the dancing turtles,  because the way that came about, the dancing turtles   would you like to  hear that?  Yes, I   d like to hear that story.  Well, my husband had been sick for quite a while, and it was kind of a  tough time. One summer, he was sick. My sister had a stroke, and my  mom almost passed away. My grandson wrecked a car, so there was a  lot of things. We even had a storm that blew our fence down, so a lot of  stuff to deal with. I was in my studio one day, trying to get myself to  where I could work and concentrate, and kind of having a pity party. I  collect little miniature turtles, have for a long time, just because I think  they   re fun.  All of a sudden in my mind   my imagination works overtime  sometimes. All of a sudden, I was dancing around the room with my  turtles. It just made me feel good, made me smile, and so I did a painting  of three turtles dancing because I needed a piece to donate to OU. It was  the arts department. They were having a fundraising thing. That   s what I  did it for. Then from then on, I   ve had people wanting dancing turtles.  It   s been a lot of fun to think of different ways to show dancing turtles  because, you know, why are they dancing? (Laughter)  When you look back at your career, what do you think was that fork-in-the-  road moment where you could have gone one way, but you chose to  go another?  20  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  You mean to be an artist? I think I   ve always, always felt like that   s  what I needed to do. To go full-time as a full-time artist, that was scary  because I had depended on income as a teacher, and the art business is  tough. It   s hard work, and it   s a gamble of whether you   re going to sell  or not.  One thing that had happened was I moved from Tahlequah to Oklahoma  City because I was working so many long hours in Tahlequah. I was not  only the art teacher, photography teacher, humanities teacher, but I also  was in charge of the news for all the schools. All kinds of things. I was  working all the time. I decided that I was wearing out and was offered a  job in Oklahoma City. It was supposed to be in upper-elementary and no  sponsorships or anything. When I got there and reported for work, it was  in a huge junior high that was horrible. I had thirty to thirty-five students  in a class at a time, and it was just a disaster. I finally got ill from it.  It   s like I had to have a real hit on the head to realize what I needed to do  because I had a lot of friends who were encouraging me to go ahead and  go full-time, but I was too scared to do it. My husband at that time had  retired from his job, so we sat down and talked about it and decided  what he was going to do, what I was going to do, and we went for it.  You brought up your memory circles, and I think we   re going to get to  see one or two in a couple of the images here, but I wonder if you can  talk about how that device came to you.  Well, a lot of my paintings have come from when I just wake up in the  morning. I see an image, a picture finished in my mind. It   s like a color  slide. In those, a lot of those, especially the Trail of Tears pieces and  some of the Cherokee culture pieces, I would see those. To me, it would  mean all the wonderful things we   ve inherited from the past, what we   re  doing with now, and our hope for the future. That   s what those mean to  me.  You described part of your creative process. What else is involved? Do  you keep a little notebook of ideas?  They   re here. Sometimes they stack up too deep. (Laughter) Sometimes  there will be one or two that will be very emotional to me, that keeps  bugging me until I have to do it. (Laughter) I don   t like to do  commission work because I have too many of the others that I   m  wanting to do, but sometimes the money helps.  Are you a daytime painter, or do you prefer working at night?  21  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  Little Thunder  Sullivan  I used to work all hours. I used to work all night sometimes, but now I  don   t. My best time to work is early in the morning until about one or  two in the afternoon.  What has been one of the high points in your career?  I don   t know. We   ve already talked about some. The achievements are  good, but I think the most important thing to me is just being able to feel  that I   m doing what I need to do. It   s nice to be recognized for doing  that, but it   s not the most important thing. It   s doing the art that   s  important. I think that   s the best part, is just being able to do it.  How about a low point in your career?  When my husband passed away, because nobody really understands that,  going through that, until they go through it. It   s like half of you is gone,  and he was really half of the job. I mean, because art, you   re an artist.  It   s work. So that part was gone, and then trying to figure out who you  are again. I wasn   t sure I could even do the work. I wasn   t sure I wanted  to.  That was why it was such a blessing to get   I think God took care of me  because I got the commission from the National Park Service and all of  the encouragement from that. I got several things of recognition that  helped. The Cherokee Nation was very encouraging on a lot of things. It  was like every time I sat down and said,    I quit. I don   t want to do this  anymore,    then it was like,    No, you   re not through. You have other  things to do. Get with it.    That, I think, was good. It was not time for me  to quit yet.  Is there anything else you   d like to talk about or anything we   ve  forgotten to mention before we look at your work?  I can   t think of anything. We covered it pretty good.  All right, great. We   ll take a look at some of these paintings and  reproductions. Would you like to tell us about this piece?  This is called War and Peace, but it   s also Man and Woman. My art has  sometimes been described as spiritual abstraction, so this illustrates  some of that. This is the memory circle. This divides   this side is male.  To the Cherokee, the man is the moon and the winter. The falcon is the  war bird. This is still the symbol for the Cherokee veterans, and the  seven feathers for the seven clans. Man went to war in the winter. This  side is woman. The eagle is the peace bird or the messenger. Woman is  summer and the sun. She brings life, and the harvest is in the summer.  22  Little Thunder  Sullivan  This is the rattlesnake design. This is the peace design.  Great. Okay, let   s take a look at the next one.  This is a poster of Mrs. Webber   s Plantation. This is the one that we  discussed that was the first painting that I did for the National Park  Service. This shows a family that have gotten their supplies, and they   re  sitting down here by the creek preparing a meal. This is the first one  in  the series .  This is a print of the painting I did for the Trail of Tears. It   s called But  This is My Home. The actual site is in Georgia where my ancestor lived.  It   s got the red clay of Georgia. This is the background they would have  seen out of their cabin, the Smokies. We got to go to the New Echota  and found that their cabin was sixteen foot by sixteen foot and got the  description. I tried to show that. I even put the newspaper here,  Cherokee paper on this porch. You   ll notice, these are the soldiers,  shadows of the soldiers that are coming to take them away from their  home, and they   re saying,    But this is my home.     The Georgia Trail of Tears Association and the National Park Service  used this image on some of their historical markers there in Georgia.  That was thrilling to me because that   s where my family came from  originally.  This painting is Gifts of Our Ancestors, Fourteen Generations. This is a  painting about my Cherokee family, fourteen generations of them. It   s  based on family history and also on a dream that my eldest son, right  here, James, had about this. He described what was going on in the  dream. There were seven men around the fire. There were five women in  the background in his dream. There was a medicine man that stood  behind this old man, sang a song in Cherokee, and then he gave him a  gift which was a deer hide. Then he stood behind this man, sang a song,  and he gave him a red arrow, and so on.  My son had never studied the costumes, the history, or anything, so it  was quite an event for us. Anyway, after we got through all this, we  realized that the gifts represented what went on in their lifetime. The  Cherokee were slaughtering the deer to trade to the whites. In his  lifetime, he was given the red arrow because he lived during the French  and Indian War and the Revolutionary War.  His gift to Young Deer in Georgia was the turtle rattle. That was during  the forced civilization policy of the government. It says,    Hang on to the  culture.    See, he   s got it right here. Then Young Deer gives his son,  Indian John, the talking stick. The man who is speaking in the council  23  Little Thunder  Sullivan  holds the stick. When he   s finished, he gives it to the next one.  He lived in Georgia, (he was killed by the vigilantes or whatever) and  then he came to Oklahoma. His gift to my father, who is right here, who  was born in Stilwell, he gave him a little gold ring with a hole in it. We  couldn   t figure out what in the world, but during his lifetime, my great-grandmother   s  lifetime, his daughter, my grandmother, my dad, they  worked really, really hard to try to hang on to what little they had, and it  always had a hole in it. Also, the gold that was discovered in Georgia  during their lifetime wasn   t really that good. It always had a hole in it.  We thought that was pretty good. Then my dad   s gift to James was a  little black book. We didn   t know for sure what it was. He thought it  might be a Bible.  A couple of years after I did a sketch for James, (he said,    Mom, you   ve  got to do this,    so I did a sketch for him) I didn   t think any more about  it, but when we went to the Jacobson House in Norman to hear Chad  Smith and one of our tribal elders, Hastings Shade, give a talk, Hastings  was telling some of the old stories and things. He talked about a bunch  of stuff, but then one of the things he said was,    The Cherokees believe  life goes in cycles of fourteen generations. The fourteenth is now. What  we do to prepare that fourteenth to start it all over again, that depends on  whether it will be good or bad, what we do to prepare them.     So we went, like,    Whoa  That   s what that was about.    The woman on  the far end is James    daughter, my granddaughter, and her daughter. Her  daughter is the seventh woman in the picture, and she   s also the  fourteenth generation, which we thought was really interesting. My dad  was real involved in his church, and so is he, so we thought,    Well, the  Bible does make sense after all.    So that   s what the painting   this is the  blue timeline and the memory circle showing the gifts, except right here,  Young Deer giving Indian John the gift.  That   s a wonderful painting and a wonderful story. Thank you for  sharing that.  Thank you.  -------  -------
