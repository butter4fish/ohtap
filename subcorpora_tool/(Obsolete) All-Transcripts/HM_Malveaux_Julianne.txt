Speaker 1: ...By slating it so I want you to state your name and spell it for us.
Speaker 2: Okay.  It's Dr. Julianne Malveaux, and Julianne is J-U-L-I-A-N-N-E, Malveaux, M-A-L-V-E-A-U-X.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I want you to look at me.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, you know I'm a media person--,
Speaker 1: I know, I know. She's got it, she's (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: --I look at the camera.
Speaker 1: What types of things have you produced, too?
Speaker 2: A few documentaries.  When I--long story, but maybe one, two, two little documentaries, one that got some PBS [Public Broadcasting System] play [on television], and then it took me about four years to raise the money for this King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] piece.  It's something I've been on forever, about Dr. King's economic legacy.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And finally pulled all the money together actually as of January of 2000.
Speaker 1: Uh huh.
Speaker 2: But then it was an  [presidential] election year, and in fact, I thought I was going to have to work harder to get that last bit of money, and it turned out that I was just blessed.  A friend had a grant to increase the number of African Americans majoring in economics and public policy, and I'm kind of the poster child for, "What do you do as an economist if you don't teach?" so he had some money left in his grant, and he said "This is perfect for my grant," and so I got more than I expected.  I had expected to have to spend another, you know, couple months begging and calling.  You know how that fundraising thing goes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And it didn't, and I was lucky, but meanwhile I'd started on a project that was convention-based, and my company produced a pilot called 'A Room Full of Women' at both the Democratic and Republican [political party] Conventions.  It's a program that's in development now that I co-host with a Gen [Generation] X white Republican woman, and it's a woman's kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So this has been something in the making a very long time.  I imagine when we finish it that I will--you know, my problem is that I'm always sort of doing everything.
Speaker 1: Lots of things.
Speaker 2: Which is the way that I have to live.  Otherwise--but it's not quite as focused as some I'd like.  It works for me.
Speaker 1: But it works for you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Doing okay.
Speaker 2: So some I'm not worried about, but it works for me.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Okay, so we're going to continue with the slating.  I want you to just state your birth date.
Speaker 1: September 22, 1953.
Speaker 2: And your--I want today's date?
Speaker 1: Today is June 20, 2001.
Speaker 2: And I want also the location that we are.  We're in your--.
Speaker 1: You're at my home in Washington, DC, 1318 Corcoran Street, Northwest.  My offices are located on the top floor.
Speaker 2: Okay, and your profession.
Speaker 1: I'm an economist, writer, syndicated columnist, author.
Story_ID: 18574
Speaker 1: The first question is what's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Hmm.  Gee, that's a hard question.  What is my favorite?  Shrimp.
Speaker 1: A favorite color?
Speaker 2: Red.
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Accra, Ghana.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Probably fall.
Speaker 1: And favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Hmph.  "Don't believe the hype."
Speaker 1: Okay, Boy you did that well.
Story_ID: 18575
Speaker 1: Often what I like to do is ask people about their background, their, you know, their parents, and your mother's name is--is it Pro--?
Speaker 2: Proteone.
Speaker 1: Proteone.  That's an unusual name.
Speaker 2: It's very unusual.
Speaker 1: Proteone.  What was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Alexandria.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 18576
Speaker 1: So there's three girls and one boy?
Speaker 2: Four girls.
Speaker 1: Four girls.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Marianne--it was me, Marianne--me, then my brother--sibling order is me, then my brother [James Malveaux], then Marianne and Mariette, who are twins.  Marianne is a Wharton [Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] Business  MBA [Masters of Business Administration].  Mariette is the only of us who has children, and then Antoinette, the baby, who also has a Wharton MBA so Antoinette and Marianne both went to Wharton.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And some folks find that just they were early on at Wharton, Marianne especially, early on at Wharton.
Story_ID: 18577
Speaker 1: ...[asking] about your mother [Proteone Alexandria Malveaux], and I was just wondering what you can, you know, what you know about her family and her background?
Speaker 2: Sure.  My mom is from the Gulf Coast of Mississippi, Biloxi.  I believe she was born in Biloxi.  Her maternal--her mom [Rose E. Hawkins Nelson] was a teacher at Tuskegee [Tuskeegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], did homemaking, taught homemaking in the [Biloxi] Bay area early on, worked in one of the factories, and her dad [James Alexandria] was Haitian and came here, I guess, in the 1920s, spoke a bit of patois [dialect].  He died when I was about nine, eight or nine, so I did know him, although obviously not super well, but--and had very fond memories of him.  He was a electronic type, fixing radios and doing that kind of thing.  My great grandmother had eight children, five of whom lived, all of whom went to college.  Education is a like huge value in our family.  It's--I think the only time I remember my grandmother slapping me, I had picked up some little, for want of a better word, white trash girlfriend whose whole family sort of started reproducing at seventeen or something.  I said, "Well, I'm just gonna be like them and have a baby, and I'll find a husband and sit home."  Smack! You know, and I'm picking up my jaw.  That was just like the totally unacceptable answer so it was always assumed that all of us would go to college.  My mom went to Xavier [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana] for a year, and she tells us--I probably shouldn't tell her story, but this wonderful story about having been put out of college for drinking creme de cacao [liquor].  Contextually you have to hear the story because the way she says, "Well, I was only drinking creme de cacao."  Well, Xavier is a Catholic College, and this was the 1940s, and this was simply not done, and she was, you know, a bourgeoisie, debutante type, pledged Delta Sigma Theta [African American sorority], and was in love with some drummer who she continued to talk about until I finally told her "I'm tired of hearing about this man who could have been my father," and anyway she used to sneak out to meet him at this club at all of eighteen, and one of her cousins who was very jealous of her, because of all that old black folks stuff, light skin, long hair--just sort of in memory to that, I don't have hair.  No way, never, but in any case, she used to sneak out and meet this guy, and one of the nuns followed her so she got put out of school, and she ended up--they made her--my great-grandmother had a laundry in--I believe a laundry or some kind of store in Biloxi, and they made my mother do menial tasks in the window as a way of just sort of humiliating her and reminding her that she had not--you know, she blew it.  She screwed up.  She immigrated to San Francisco [California] and went to San Francisco State [University], met my dad, had us, was one of the first African American social workers in the city and county of San Francisco, worked at the post office when my parents were divorced when I was six, and worked at the post office, responsible for some of my early rising habits because I was the oldest.  I had to get up and lock the door, and it was about four [o'clock] in the morning, and then I had the house to myself, and I continued to just to feel like you have the world to yourself at four or five o'clock in the morning.  Nobody would call you, nobody would bother you so it's all yours, but anyway I had a clipping of her from 1963.  I think I finally lost it, but it was a great clip, '63 [1963] or '65 [1965], where it was in the 'San Francisco Chronicle' [newspaper], and she talked about divorced women needing services, to testifying before the Commission on the Status of Women in San Francisco, and so in 1984 when I ran for the Board of Supervisors [of the city and county of San Francisco], she sort of slapped this on me like, "You're playing bid whist and this is a card."  This is a trump card and said, "Well, now, you're not the only one in this family who has had interactions with public bodies."  "Well, okay.  Gotcha," but she's a fascinating lady.  She went back to get her doctorate in 1970 when I went to undergraduate school, and went ABD [all but dissertation] at UC [University of California] Berkeley and became one of the first African Americans--in fact, she and another woman were hired at the same time.  They were the first African Americans to teach at the University of Mississippi [Oxford, Mississippi].  She founded the social work practicum program at Ole Miss [University of Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi], which they didn't have there before, and she stayed there for about three or four years, and then she came back to San Francisco.  Mississippi--although she was from Mississippi and was used to Mississippi, as a middle-aged person in a town like Oxford, I don't think it was very socially inviting for her.  Her students were her social life.  There weren't very many African American professionals, and so, you know, her big kick of the week was cooking a big pot of beans and having a bunch of students over and listening to some jazz.
Story_ID: 18578
Speaker 1: You were saying that there were several stories.  I was asking.
Speaker 2: We--you know, my--because my great-aunt, great-great aunt--is she--no, she's great-aunt.  My grandmother's sister just died in January of 2000.  She was ninety three or four, and she would just tell all these stories about everyone, about just how mischievous they were and everything.  There was a lot of storytelling in the family just about things that had happened because we were a family who apparently--it's a source of irritation to me.  We knew who owned us, and they seemed to get some pride out of knowing their white people.  I did not find this to be a matter of pride, and one time my great-aunt [Annie Mae Randall] slapped me.  I was living in Moss Point, Mississippi.  I had to go there for high school for a year 'cause I'd been kind of a problem child, and she pointed out these Dancels and said, "They're the Dancels that used to own us," and I responded--it was maybe '69 [1969] or '70 [1970]--I responded in the vernacular of the day, "And who the--?"  "I don't give a--," and the next thing you know, I'm picking up my jaw again so they knew who the people were, and they had great folklore to tell about how we had land and how some of the land was taken back in the '30s [1930s] during the Depression.  We had the myth of the moving fence.  We owned some land, and one day the white folks just decided we didn't own it.  It eventually was donated to the city as Hawkins Street.  Hawkins is my grandmother's [Rose E. Hawkins Nelson] maiden name.  They were Hawkins so it was donated to the city of Moss Point as Hawkins Street, but as far as I'm concerned, that's an insufficient resolution.  I have very absolute reasons for liking reparations, and they're not just ideological.  My mom [Proteone Alexandria Malveaux] went to Catholic school.  We actually--in 1986 we went with her to the anniversary of her church which was Our Mother of Sorrow Church in Biloxi [Mississippi], and it was their seventy-fifth or hundredth anniversary.  It was the oldest--one of the oldest catholic churches west of the Mississippi or something.  I'm sure I'm getting part of it wrong, and the order of nuns who ran the show were the nuns who were chartered to help the Negro and the Indian so she took us to this to meet all her people from school, and you know, everybody talked about how, you know, how bright she had always been.  They knew that she was gonna be a teacher or something.  I met some of her schoolmates, and they all told how studious she was and playful as well.
Story_ID: 18579
Speaker 1: What about the family that owned you?  Do you know much about them?
Speaker 2: I don't want to know.  It would cause me--no, I don't know, and I don't wanna know because it would cause me to behave in a way that would be inappropriate.  I know that they were pillars of this town of Moss Point [Mississippi], and there were two brothers, and one of them was kind of a party guy.  One of our relatives used to regularly pick his pocket and was able to buy a funeral home and do all this stuff because the guy would just get so sloppy drunk that he'd have money in his pocket, and my cousin, whatever, the chauffeur would just pick his pocket, and when he came to, he'd say, "Did I have any money?"  He'd tell him, "No."  You know, he just accumulated.  I guess our folks were slightly more honest and not quite as devious, but we hopefully have made up for that in subsequent generations.  No, to me, it's a source of bitterness, and so it's something that I really frankly would, you know, rather not know much about.  I had some white boy call me, one day, and I use the term white boy freely at folks.  I get in a lot of trouble for it, but 'til it's even, I'll say whatever, you know, as long as I don't call 'em a white--, you know, whatever.  One guy called me.  He found me on the Internet and wanted to know--he thought we were related because they may have owned us, and I said, "You know, you have a hell of a nerve.  How dare you pick up a telephone and dial my digits [phone number] and initiate a conversation about something like that?"  I said, "If you did, then you should just send me a check," you know.  "Just put the check in the mail, you know, but I'm not gonna engage in dialogue with you."  I know that there are these black folks who wanna go back and be friends and 'Kumbaya', but, you know, I study economics and the gap, the wealth gap, the income gap, and the other gaps are so large that I just don't find this stuff all that amusing.  When African American people own two percent of our nation's wealth, then I quite frankly don't wanna know who owned me unless they wanna give up some of the ducats [currency], plain and simple.
Story_ID: 18580
Speaker 1: Your father.  Can you tell us his name, and, you know, and what you know about him and his background, too?
Speaker 2: His name is Paul Warren Malveaux, was Paul Warren Malveaux.  He passed [away] in 1989.  I was not very close to him.  My parents were divorced when I was six, and he and I had a fairly stormy relationship.  Many say it's because I was just like him.  My family has--everybody has some form of a temper, and some people modify--Antoinette [sister] is probably the nicest Malveaux, but she has one, too.  It's up in there somewhere, and she's the baby.  She doesn't have to have a temper, see, because we have her back, but we all have these, you know, terrifying tempers or so we're told.  I just think, you know, you say what you think and do what you have to do and get over it, but anyway he and I did not get along so I don't know a whole lot about him.  He came from a humongous family in Opelousas, Louisiana, about twelve or thirteen of them.  I don't think that any of his siblings are still alive.  He was one of the younger of the group, served in the military, came to California, was a teacher.  He went to University of San Francisco, and there was this group of African American men, just a handful of them, in the '50s [1950s], early '50s [1950s], late '40s [1940s], who went to USF [University of San Francisco, San Francsico, California], which was a Jesuit school, and people--there's a guy named Burl Toler, who you actually may also want.  He's one of the first black coaches in the NFL [National Football League], not coaches, referees, and he lives in the [San Francisco] Bay area.  He's probably in his mid-seventies now, fine as wine, and a really nice guy.  This group of men are sort of--people in San Francisco talk about them.  That was that group that went to, that first group that went to USF so people sort of use them as a benchmark for access so he was a teacher, one of the first African American teachers and principals in the city and county, and retired, I guess, in the mid '70s [1970s] to go on and make a bunch of money doing real estate.  They were giving people buyouts if you had been in the district for a certain amount of time so a principal, who--temper.  One of my favorite and funniest stories about my father, I met a guy when I was running for office, and he said, "Well, you know, Mr. Malveaux was the scariest man I've--," and I'm like, "Scary?  I mean, he evil, but he's not scary," and this guy told a story about how he had some beer in his locker so he had--my father knew, was hip to him and was trying to catch it in the act, and so one day he had opened his locker, and the beer was in the locker.  There's my father, and he said he saw him so he took off running 'cause he just didn't want to deal with it, and he said my father, who's a hefty guy, ran after him, and he looked back, and my father was bent over like he was in pain, and he said,"Well, you know, Mr. Malveaux was kind of old so I went back to see if he was okay, and he grabbed me," and I said, "Well, see, he was slick, too,"  but, I mean, he cared, you know, passionately for his students.  I guess my source of whatever is that I have one brother who has had a--who could have benefited from that kind of caring, and when--once my parents were divorced, they just had the war of the roses.  I think they went to court--they used to go to court annually, you know.  It was one of these same time, next year kind of things.  They would look forward to going to court.  They would get dressed, buy new stuff to go to court so, you know, I went to college when I was seventeen, and I came home for Christmas, and my mother [Proteone Alexandria Malveaux] was about to go to court, and again, you know, smack in the head.  She's getting a new dress and she--and she was looking good, and I said, "Well, you know, you gonna go through all those changes to go to court.  Why don't you just give him some?"  Smack!  You know, but I mean, she had to put her makeup on and eyeliner, you know.  There's obviously something going on here that, you know--but they--I mean they had literally the war.  They would go--I was twenty years old, had published in 'Essence' magazine, had been admitted to graduate school, and these people went to court for custody of me, and it was about the tax deduction, which was $600 at the time which neither of them, I believe, was giving me, you know, as--but it was just, you know, neither one of them was gonna give, and both of them had their point of view, and you know.  They were fascinating.  I'm--actually one of these days may write some fiction about them.  They're fascinating, both brilliant, obviously just not meant to live in the same household.
Story_ID: 18581
Speaker 1: Were you born in San Francisco [California]?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  I was born in San Francisco in 1953.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: What were some of your earliest memories of growing up?
Speaker 2: Hmm.  What--you know, I don't know.  Remember--there was a farmer's market by my house.  When I wrote poetry, I did that a long--for a while.  A lot of stuff was set at the farmer's market 'cause we would have, you know, one of those big urban out--now they're very trendy for yuppies and buppies and such.  Then they were a matter of necessity for people of modest circumstances.  Once my dad [Paul Warren Malveaux] was out of the picture, even though both my parents were professionals, my mom [Proteone Alexandria Malveaux] really had to sort of struggle to keep it together in terms of, you know, making ends meet so you needed to go to the farmer's market 'cause stuff--the produce was fresh, but it was also cheaper.  There was a--it [a store] was called like The Cannery, and it was an outlet where you could get dented cans for less, and so it would be a major excursion.  All of us had to go to the farmer's market and lug that stuff back up the hill, and we'd always have a lot of fun, but, you know, we'd end up eating half of the fruit and then get in trouble 'cause we're eating up the fruit or what--you know, just real that we were--yeah.  My mother had a handful on her hands so the farmer's market is central to some of my memories.  The bus, I went to Catholic school 'til the eighth grade, and the school was over the hill so we did a lot of stuff on the bus.  Talent shows in the backyard, we have a double lot in San Francisco like a Victorian house and then a lot that's the same length.  There are very few of those so we'd have all kinds of stuff going on in the backyard, picnics, talent shows, getting up on the picnic tables seeing who could sing.  I was always writing songs.  Couldn't sing, but I always had something for somebody else to sing.  Yeah, and reading.  I was--I mean, I'm a nerd.  I'm an old nerd, but I was always a nerd, and I just enjoyed it.  You could not punish me.  I'd get locked in a room for punishment and the only way that I would be pained is if there was no book there.  I would read the dictionary so you really, literally could not punish me.  I think I'd read two-thirds of what was in the library up the street by the time I was ten or eleven years old.  I mean I just systematically, "Okay.  I've read the A's.  Now I'm gonna read the B's."  Just go, and encyclopedia, and I'd take the encyclopedia, and you know how at the end of the encyclopedia, they say--you know, "If you want to see this," so I'd have this little row going where I'd start out with something, and it'd say, "See this," so then I get the see thing, and I'd have the whole little row down the hall, and forbid anybody to come out to step on my encyclopedia because I was on a mission to learn whatever there was about whatever the subject was.
Story_ID: 18582
Speaker 1: Julianne, why do you think that?  Why do you think you were so attracted to reading?  Do you think it's the way your parents [Paul Warren Malveaux and Proteone Alexandria Malveaux]--what they did early on or do you think that it was just intuitive?
Speaker 2: Well, both.
Speaker 1: You think reading represented something else for you, too?
Speaker 2: Well, probably all of the above.  I mean my mother, if you went to her house now, it looks like my house in terms of books.  LaToya would say, "You have books in every room."  Pretty much, and my mother has pretty much the same thing.  She's a freak for--she orders books today that--and she'll send me a packet of books and say, you know, "You need to read this."  I clipped these book reviews for you so I think for them, I mean, if you go back in our family, there's lots of teachers.  You know, my aunt, the one I mentioned to you, had been a teacher in Moss Point [Mississippi] for like sixty years, and it was a point in time where every black person in this town had had Miss [Annie Mae] Randall [great-aunt], every black person so she knew everybody so that was one thing.  It's just books have always been valued.  Too, for me, it was an escape.  I mean, I was--I won't say that I was an unhappy child, but I probably was as intense as I am now, and you know, have the same kind of issues of "fitting in."  I was always was just intellectually curious.  I always wanted to know more.  "What's next?"  I mean if, you know, someone would mention Africa, then I wanted to know what, where, who, when, why, how, and would just read it until I was almost sated.  I mean I don't think there's a night even now when I don't fall asleep reading with, you know, with a book in my hand or a report or something and still do.  I mean yesterday I was reading something in the 'Times', and I said, "Human Rights Watch."  I was like, "Oh, I'll just download this report from the Internet," and so about two o'clock this morning I'm reading the rest of this report about domestic abuse.  Now some of it obviously bounces off my work, but I think that if I were a bus driver, I would still read like crazy 'cause it's just--you know, it's enjoyable.  It's exciting.  I love words, but I'm sure there's just piles and piles of things.  I mean I remember years ago, maybe about fifteen years ago, I was dating an idiot, and the man told me one day, he said, "These books are your friends, you know.  I'm not your friend.  These books--."  And I said, "You know, you're right.  Thank you for sharing that.  See ya," you know.  But it was one of these situations, and one of by best friends gets really angry with me if I go to her house.  She's like, "Why are you reading in my face?"  "Well, there's a conversational lull.  Nothing is happening.  You're watching TV [television].  Why shouldn't I?  I mean it's not personal.  I mean, you know, I didn't leave the room.  I'm still sitting here, you know, kind of keeping you company, but you know."  I think the worst thing you could probably do to me was just tell me I could not read, and if I have something to read, I'm fine.  I can wait in line.  I can endure airline delays, I mean, but if I don't have anything to read, we're all in trouble.
Story_ID: 18583
Speaker 1: You were saying earlier also that you were like your father [Paul Warren Malveaux] in some respects, and, you know, we all have some of our parents, and I was wondering, you know, when you look at your, you know, at your parents, what your mother [Proteone Alexandria Malveaux] and your--you say your love of reading has come from your mother, but I'm wondering what do you have of both of your parents?
Speaker 2: Hmm.  Well, my father was a math teacher, and I think all of us, the economist, business people--that's the math piece.  I won't say you'd like to deny it, but it's just weird you end up with an economist and two MBAs [Masters in Business Administration] in one family, and you sort of say, "This is not random," so I think that the precision that comes with mathematics is my mother--I mean my father, and I think that for those of us who have these tempers that that's definitely--my father had a legendary temper, didn't like injustice, wouldn't mind telling you who, what, when, where, how, why, and I think we have that, too.  I think also my mom is a social worker, and I just said to Sharon, I said, "You know, one of these days I'm gonna overcome my tendency to do social work out of my office."  I'll tell you a funny story.  I was--years ago, the [newspaper] 'Milwaukee Journal [Sentinel]' did a review on one of my books, and the woman who did the review was really a nice woman.  I ended--I had gone to speak in Milwaukee [Wisconsin], and I had gone with one of these groups of black folks.  Interesting, you go to speak for black folks.  They want you to party all day and all night with them.  I mean you're finished with the speech, and then they wanna go out, you know, and if you don't go, they think you're stuck up, and it gets around, and they'll never ask you back.  On the other hand, if you go with some white groups, it's like, "Okay.  You gave your speech.  The speech was at six o'clock.  We're done at eight o'clock.  See ya."  You know.  "Do you have dinner plans?" And often it's put out there like, "Do you have dinner plans?  Well, you know, that's a nice restaurant over there," you know.  Well, this woman kind of saw me getting just sort of dumped off at this hotel and sort of said--and she said, "Well, what are you gonna do for dinner?"  I said, "I guess I'll, you know, order me some room service or--," and she said, "Well, let's have dinner," so we got to be friendly.
Story_ID: 18584
Speaker 1: Time passes, dot, dot, dot.  I'm walking up the street one day, and as I'm walking on 14th and U [intersection in Washington, D.C.], someone says, "Hey! Malveaux," and most people who say, "Hey! Malveaux" are friends, you know, or they'll say, "Julie" or "Malveaux."  I hate Julie, but that's what folks called me in college so I heard, "Hey! Malveaux" so I just speak to everybody, which is something I've--"Hey," and I keep walking, and I'm like "Why was that person speaking to me?  Did I know them, you know?"  It just hit me like when I got around the corner so I came back, and the woman says to me, "You're not gonna speak to me."  And I said, "Well, do I know you?"  Well, it turned out to be this woman [columnist for the 'Milwaukee Journal Sentinel' newspaper] who had interviewed me, but she was now homeless, living on the streets, had hooked up with some no good man who had pretty much took her money, treated her bad, and she was between a shelter and a friend's house so I said, "Well, come home with me and have a cup of tea."  And so she came and I said, "Well, you know, why you living like this?"  And she kind of telling me her story, and the sun was setting.  It was early, late fall, early winter, and I said, "Well, what are you gonna do?  You just can't be living on the street."  And she said, "Well, I don't know."  Proteone Malveaux's voice came out of my mouth.  I didn't say this.  My mother did.  "You could stay here."  I looked.  I said, "Who said--?"  It's like the body snatchers came and got me.  I was totally amazed at myself.  I said, "I know that was not my intentions," but my mother is a social worker.  When she worked for the department, she would bring folks home, anybody.  I mean bring them home, give them my new clothes, which is probably why I have so many clothes 'cause she'd literally give--I'd have some new with tags on it.  "Oh, give it to them.  They poor."  "Excuse me?  I just bought this," you know.  And I had this woman in my basement for a couple of months.  In fact, I finally--I think everybody around here said, "What is wrong with you?"  And actually it finally occurred to me that the--and it was an abject lesson from a policy perspective.  The act of living in the streets will make you crazy if you're not, you know.  I mean this woman when I first knew her was wonderful, brilliant, interesting, fun.  She just turned really weird, and when I began to feel uneasy in my own house, that's when I sort of said, "Okay, we have to go to Plan B," and Plan B was to get her back to Milwaukee [Wisconsin] where she had a cousin and to help her financially to do that, and it was really funny because she went to stay with her cousin.  She was here for a couple of months.  She went to stay with her cousin...
Story_ID: 18585
Speaker 1: Stay with her cousin, and then her cousin couldn't keep her so she went to stay with some nuns in Upper Peninsula of Wisconsin, and them nuns put her out of there in a week, you know, 'cause she wouldn't work.  Them nuns said, "No, no, no, no."  This is tough love.  So it was kind of interesting, but that was definitely--the social work piece comes from my mom, although I try very hard to suppress it because, you know, I will give you the shirt off my back, but I'd really rather keep it.  You know, if I have my druthers, I'd rather keep my shirt.
Speaker 2: Tell me schools you went to.  You went--where did you go to elementary school?  You were going in San Francisco [California], right?
Speaker 1: I went to Immaculate Conception Elementary School in San Francisco--it was a Catholic school--through the eighth grade.  I went to Lowell High School.  No, I went to Aptos Junior High for the ninth grade, Lowell High School for the tenth grade.  Then I got into a little trouble, just sort of [Black] Panther-related, juvenile-delinquency-related, had great grades, no deportment whatsoever so my mother got tired of me and sent me to Mississippi to live with this old [great] aunt, Auntie Annie Mae, Annie Mae Randall, and I was there for the eleventh grade and was in--caused more trouble down there than was useful for anybody and had a big old Afro, little bitty miniskirts, you know.  The principal was constantly having me come to his office so he could measure my skirts, and I'd always say, "Man, you a freak.  Why do you feel like you need to measure my skirt?  You just wanna feel my legs."  You know, I mean you could look at the skirt and tell that it wasn't that long.  What would you get from measuring the skirt, and then he'd send me home, and then my aunt who was part of educational, you know, community there would be embarrassed, and then she'd "Girl, you're gonna be the death of me."  And you know we'd go round and round and do that three or four times, but it was obvious that structure and me weren't making it so I took the ACTs and the SATs [college admissions tests] and ended up going to college after the eleventh grade so I went to Boston College [Boston, Massachusetts] under early admit, and I was in class '74 [1974] there.
Story_ID: 18586
Speaker 1: Could we go back a minute--go back before we get to the college--.  Were there--as a student were there teachers like even in--did you do okay at Catholic School?  See, it seems to me that you would be--.
Speaker 2: No, not particularly.  Well, actually I had the highest GPA [grade point average], and there's still a picture that they have at this school.  I think the first time that they got--someone got the award for having the best grades, but I didn't get the award for the best behavior, so they had to split the award up and give the best behavior award to somebody else which was fine with me.  I mean Catholics--no.  I didn't like Catholic school, but my mother insisted on it.  About the sixth grade, seventh grade, your little hormones start racing, and there were maybe--there was a brother who had Coke-bottle glasses and white socks, and, you know, that wasn't gonna happen, and there were no other black men, you know, boys or whatever in the class so I wasn't, you know, feeling that--we used to have little uniform skirts and roll them up so you could flash your legs on the bus or whatever, and I didn't like the white girls, and this was, you know, getting to be Black Power time, and I really just did not like--I remember I had a friend who we used to walk back over that hill together, and her sister had said something about the niggers, and you know, I hit the girl.  I had no choice, and of course, that was more trouble, but you know, you just--San Francisco [California] is a city that has what I call, "Have a Nice Day" racism.  I mean it's not, you know, you never had signs.  You never had that, but there were lots of unspoken things and so I found myself just sort of chafing and kind of always--and that may be part of the book thing.  You know, I could always find solace, friendship, whatever in a book.
Story_ID: 18587
Speaker 1: Talk about the, you know, the unspoken things that you're talking about, I mean 'cause, you know, we are a function of how we grew up in some respects, and it sounds like you were rooted, definitely rooted in the black experience in your family, but you were still growing up in a white, you know?  Am I wrong or--?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean our neighborhood [in San Francisco, California] was mixed.  We lived in a mixed neighborhood.  We lived in Bernal Heights.  My mother [Proteone Alexandria Malveaux] still lives in the house I grew up in so it wasn't very--it was, you know, working class, ethnic people really, not a lot of black people.  There is a neighborhood Bayview-Hunters Point that was sort of the 'hood, and of course, the Fillmore which was sort of the center of jazz and also the 'hood, and after redevelopment in 1946 they began to tear up the Fillmore area.  The Ocean View-Ingleside area became more African American as people left there so we didn't live in any of those areas.  We lived in a different area which was a nice area, and it was kind of a derivative area in an interesting way.  There was a group called the Mission Rebels which were famous for a Latino group that--as you were doing the Black Power so we had to have the Cortland Progressives.  Cortland was the main street, and we were no where near--and I was the secretary of the Cortland Progressives 'cause that's all the woman could be, but, you know, then we were nowhere near as bad, as formidable as the Mission Rebels, but we had to have our own thing, too, so we did.  So it wasn't--the neighborhood, as I said, was a mixed neighborhood, but it was a weird--some blocks in Bernal Heights were almost all African American.  Some blocks like ours, I don't think there was one other African American family on our block.  There was a project area beneath where we lived like on another hill, go down the hill, and that was mostly African American, but depending on what was going on, you know, we were not necessarily allowed to go to the projects.  We grew up in a Catholic church which again was mixed, but, you know, not very black.  Hmm.  My mother was very involved in the church and very involved in teaching catechism and doing this kind of stuff, godmother, too, and sort of outreach, too.  She sort of felt that we shouldn't think that we were too privileged so she had lots of kids from the projects that, you know, we hung out with or whatever.  Because I didn't go to public schools, I was always kind of in the mix with the neighborhood black folks who thought I thought I was better than they was, and basically I did.  In retrospect, I remember once coming home from the library with about ten books, and this boy who had always been trying to talk to me said, "Well, who do you think you are with all these books?  You know, you're not smarter than me."  I said, "Yes, I am.  I can read.  You can't."  Then I ran like hell, you know, but it was very clear to me.  I mean to me education way over there and not better in terms of material or anything else, but see, "You can't read, and you eighteen and you up in somebody's face.  You crazy."
Story_ID: 18588
Speaker 1: Julianne, back to this whole thing of what you said that there was--not--you didn't say subtle racism.
Speaker 2: Unspoken.  Well.
Speaker 1: Unspoken, and I'm just wondering.
Speaker 2: Like Auto Row.  I mean now this--I was six or seven years old so you'd have to go into San Francisco [California] history, but Dr.--what was his name--Burbridge [Dr. Thomas Nathaniel Burbridge], his daughter Lynn Burbridge is an economist at Wellesley  [Wellesley College, Wellesley, Massachusetts]--Nate Burbridge who's one of the early presidents of the NAA- [NAACP, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in San Francisco.  Black folks could not shop on Auto Row.  Now no--again there were no signs that said you couldn't go to Auto Row.  They didn't even have a black secretary on Auto Row, and that was Van Ness Avenue where you had all of the car dealerships so there were things like that, again not said, but they were there.  My family folklore before my parents [Paul Warren Malveaux and Proteone Alexandria Malveaux] were married, they would buy furniture for the house, and a clerk wouldn't wait on my dad because someone else was there, and I understand he had quite a fit and threw the couch and turned the place out and almost got arrested, but, you know, it was perfectly acceptable to say, "Okay, I'm gonna wait on the white person first."  Things like that, you know.
Speaker 1: You're going to Catholic school.  You're excelling.  You excel, but there's a rebel side to you.
Speaker 2: Oh, very much so.  Really, excelling was only about academics.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then--okay, so at what point in time are you getting politically--I mean I know that, you know, there were a lot of--there was activism, but everyone didn't get active, and so I'm just saying what got you politically active?  You said, you know, you got into the Black Power thing?
Speaker 2: Well, at Aptos [Aptos Junior High School, San Francisco, California] we had a BSU.  We were all--I was active in the BSU, Black Student Union, and that was like in ninth grade.  I remember writing my paper about South Africa, and 'cause I used black construction paper and wrote South Africa apartheid in white chalk, you know, just to make the point quite clearly.  I was real active in that stuff at Lowell High School [San Francisco, California] which was the academic high school, was on SF State's [San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California] campus when they had the strike, and we were running around selling little Red Books, the [Chairman] Mao's [Mao Tse-tung, leader of Communist China] 'Red Book,' and [Black] Panther [political party] newspapers, and that was, you know, fourteen, thirteen, fourteen, trying to go to Panther meetings, and my poor mother used to say, "You can go as long as you come home by a certain time, and you don't sign anything."  And if you didn't come home, she would show up at the Panther headquarters with pink rollers on in her housecoat so if you did not want to be embarrassed, your best bet would be to get home on time.  You know, she pulled that one on us a couple of times.  "Okay," you know.  She's quite a character, and she's gotten worse.
Story_ID: 18589
Speaker 1: So did you--so those were the things forming you.  Were there other things forming you during this, you know, period?
Speaker 2: I think those things as much as--well, I also think the sort of--there was a lot of turbulence in our home life because of the, you know, war of the roses, and probably that is one reason that at forty-seven I have never married and feel no overwhelming desire to do so.  You know, I mean it would take a lot.  I have been engaged a few times, but, you know, I think it's the whole issue of having conflict up in your house or as a structured part of your life so repels me from anything like that.
Speaker 1: Being the oldest did you feel any--you know, a lot of times--I'm the oldest child.  You know, people say they feel burdened.  Did you feel any, you know, that you had to be an example or were you?
Speaker 2: I didn't feel like I had to be an example, but I felt like I had to do a lot.  I mean cooking was the chore that I had which I actually kind of didn't mind, but it was a chore that I had, when, you know, my mother was--she worked very hard, sometimes two jobs so that we had stuff.  I mean we were constantly doing stuff, the arts, you know, Nutcracker Suite [ballet].  I mean, she had us running to the museums, art class at the museum.  My sisters did dance, and she didn't drive either so this was all being done on the public transportation system, but we were gonna be exposed, no matter what, because that's what she had been, and so when she was not in the house, then I was in charge, and I made sure other people did their homework and all of that.  I won't say--I mean I know people who are oldest who say, "You know, it's like I raised them." But we're the five of us, and we're about a year and a half.  My mother had five children in four and a half years so I'm forty-seven.  I think Antoinette's [sister] forty-three, and that's the span so ours was not the raising kind of thing.  I think they looked up to me, and in retrospect the twins [sisters Marianne and Mariette] will sometimes say it doesn't feel like we grew up together because I hung out with my mother a little bit also, and in the context of the household I probably had a someone privileged position vis-a-vis the others, if doing all the work--well, not all the work--doing a lot of work is a privilege.  I used to use her credit card to pick stuff up and do that kind of thing so, you know, but it was--but as I say, I know people who're like maybe a bit older, and they say, "I feel like I raised them."  No, I don't feel like I raised them, but--and I never really felt--I mean that example thing.  I always tell people, "I don't consider myself a role model.  I consider myself an option," you know, 'cause role model means, you know, people look at what you do, and they wanna do that, and they wanna do it the way you did it.  Well, this is one way to do it.  It's not the only way to do it, you know.
Speaker 1: So when you say an option, you're talking about an option of what one's life can be.
Speaker 2: Right.  A possibility, you know.
Story_ID: 18590
Speaker 1: Now so you you get active in the Black Power Movement.  You find that sort of--what about that sort of attracts you 'cause really it started there, right?
Speaker 2: Well, the [Black] Panthers [political party] were, you know, we want freedom.  We want the power to determine our destiny.  That's the first point of a ten point program.  I mean that is attractive, especially when you feel--when you see, you know.  Again San Francisco wasn't the south.  You don't see that deep kind of discrimination, but you had the stories and we'd been south which was not necessarily pleasant, and because I read everything, you almost sort of like ingested civil rights, and this whole notion that black people can determine their destiny was exciting to me and important and just the--I think it was very intoxicating.  I remember we were out at the Free Huey [Newton] Rally, May 1, 1969, and there are two reasons I remember it--one, I wrote some poetry about the period.  The other is that I sometimes tell people in jest, "That was my television debut."  I think I was all of about sixteen, not quite sixteen, fifteen, and we were told to go to school, and when my mother [Proteone Alexandria Malveaux] said, "The Malveaux children will be going to school," we said "Okay, cool." so we went to homeroom, you know.  You'd go to homeroom, and they'd mark you present, and you leave, and my brother [James Malveaux] and I went down to the rally, and one of the news people had gotten something of a profile of me, but then, you know, there were so many sisters with big Afros that it could have been anybody, but I--at some point had given some newsperson the finger so that was kind of unmistakably me 'cause it was full face, and at the end of the day when my neighbor said to my mother "Your daughter's on television," she said "Well, that couldn't be.  She went to school."  And so we sat at the table.  She said, "Did you go to school?"  I said "Yes, ma'am," and so she's flipping channels and trying to figure it out, and shit here I come.  She said "Well, tell me."  I said, "I have nothing to say."  I mean one picture's worth a thousand words, you know, but I mean it was very intoxicating to see us like literally surrounding city hall.  There was a bookstore in San Francisco [California] that was very important to me, shaped me quite a bit called Marcus Book Store [Marcus Books].  Julian Richardson was the proprietor and just passed [away] last year.  We'd go down to city hall and raise hell, and then we'd go over to the bookstore, and, you know, just--I mean you just inhaled, and the poetry was out there.  Sonia Sanchez came to my high school and told us we should do whatever we could for the movement, but don't give it up, and, you know, she was very clear.  You know, "You do not make babies for the revolution," because that was what the brothers would tell you.  You know, I mean, "Give it up for the revolution so we can build an army of strong black people."  I mean, it's a novel rap if it works, you know, but so all those folks were around us, and so it just was you almost couldn't help but get caught up into it, although, you know, I imagine there are those who didn't, but for me, again, it was the intellectual curiosity, the whole notion of self-determination really, and then as you looked at stuff, differential status, unemployment rates, stuff like that.  I mean I kept little notebooks with that stuff.  When I was fourteen and fifteen years old, I could tell you what the black unemployment rate was because it was different from the white unemployment, and I'd tell you in a minute.  Don't tell me because of da, da, da.  You know.
Story_ID: 18591
Speaker 1: So who were you reading at the time? Who were your bibles, I mean, of, you know, of authors and things like that?
Speaker 2: Oh, I read everything and anything, Maya [Angelou], 'The Red Book' [by Chairman Mao Tse-tung, leader of Communist China] .  We read the, you know, the '[Black] Panther' [political party] paper every week, the 'San Francisco [California] Sun-Reporter' [newspaper].  Dr. Gundell was another one that we all sort of gravitated around.  I read a lot of [William Edward Burghardt] DuBois back then, which was, yeah, different, but I can't tell you what I read 'cause I literally read everything.  I mean if it was African American, if it was written by a black person, I had it.  If it was poetry, I mean we all thought we were poets, and we all wrote poetry, and we could all stand at the microphone and (unclear) these little performance kids, they have nothing on us, these folks who do the spoken word.  Well, you know, we were doing that, and it was, you know, what we did.
Speaker 1: So when you went back--when you were shipped off, you know, after you said you got in trouble.  What trouble did you get into?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was just very worried about me.  By hanging out with the Panthers it exposed me to hang out with a lot of older guys so, you know, I would stay out and come back in whenever.  My mother [Proteone Alexandria Malveaux] would say come in at midnight, and I would tell her "The statistical probability of me getting in at midnight was point, something, something, something because after all no one could arrive exactly at midnight."  She'd say, "Well, come in ten minutes earlier."  "Well, why would I cut my fun down because of da, da, da."  So, you know, she just couldn't handle me.  I had behavioral issues at school.  You know, the teacher was a white pig.  You know, I didn't want to read this because they were written by white authors and, you know, they didn't have anything that was relevant.  I mean at high school we had struck to get Swahili taught.  It wasn't the most relevant language in the world, but anyway, in retrospect, but we struck to have Swahili and to make sure we had that exposure and this, that, and the other, and she just felt like, "I just cannot handle this."  So she wanted me to go to public school.  I would've lasted in public school about a week.  I'd have my butt beat everyday.  I'm real clear 'cause those little sisters did not play.  They did not like nerds.  I was definitely a nerd and a cute nerd, too, so, I mean, I could pull if I had to, but that was going to be a problem so, you know, she said, "Okay, we're sending you"--well, so she sent me actually to L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and in L.A. my aunt there was like one of the strictest--I mean she'd smack you for rolling your eyes, I mean, and you're like--and I argued with her, and I mean I walked around just bruised.  "Well, they're my eyes.  How can you tell me what goes on in my head," you know.  And finally they had to get me up out of there because I probably would have been killed.  I mean this aunt was, you know.  She didn't play, and so she'd never had any children, and people sent their children to her, it's like sort of like boot camp, you know.  And so, you know, then I went down [to Moss Point, Mississippi] to Auntie Annie Mae [Randall] who sort of felt like, "Well, you know, if nothing else, she could hang," and it actually turned out, she couldn't either, but meanwhile we had an interesting year, and she had a house that was like my mother's house.  There were books everywhere.  I had my own room.  I didn't have to do too much, basically go to school and stay out of trouble, and I managed to do A and not B so.
Story_ID: 18592
Speaker 1: And so then you were there for the eleventh grade and then you came back?
Speaker 2: Then I went straight to Boston [Boston College, Boston, Massachusetts].  I mean I came--.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right so.
Speaker 2: I mean I only came home for a minute and then I went to.
Speaker 1: But what was part of that decision for you to go to school?
Speaker 2: Everybody.  I didn't want to go back to high school.  I didn't think I was going to enjoy it.  Some of the peer stuff wasn't me.  My mother [Proteone Alexandria Malveaux] didn't want to have to handle--she sort of felt like if I was in a more intellectually challenging environment, maybe I would chill out.  My dad [Paul Warren Malveaux], at the time, pretty much felt the same way.  I mean he called periodically.  "I hear you're giving your aunt a hard time."  "Whatever," you know, so and I tested in and had, you know, I had great scores and great grades and all that good stuff, and they wanted--I got into four colleges without finishing high school, including Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], where I really wanted to go, but unfortunately Howard kept sending me these letters saying, "Now send us your high school diploma," "But I don't have one," and then somehow this thing just got lost in translation.  I was afraid.  I said now, I'll go to Howard University with no diploma, and they'll send me back to high school, and that's not gonna happen so BC [Boston College] offered a full ride.  Howard offered a scholarship also, but BC offered a full ride, and that was all she wrote.
Speaker 1: So you're up, and BC is actually a Catholic university.
Speaker 2: It was a Catholic university.  Yeah, which made my mother feel somewhat better until I got there, but they had a black talent program that was for us, and--but they'd somehow had not made dormitory space available for the black students.  So--for all the black students--so we ended up taking over a dorm and decided we were gonna have the first coed dorm on campus, our rationale being we were black before we had gender.  You know, when two black people laid down, they knew they were gonna have a black person.  They didn't know whether they'd have a boy or girl so we were black before we had gender.  We could all stay in the same dorm together, and we did, but the Jesuit priests' bow to propriety was that we had fire doors between the top floor, which was women, and the bottom two floors were for men, but those fire doors were regularly disabled so it kinda didn't matter, but well, it did for propriety's sake, and then, of course, when the white students got back, "Like how come the black students have coed dorm and we don't?" and the next thing you know, half the dorms at BC had gone coed, but so we walked right into protest activity at Boston College and fell right into it, enjoyed it, and felt like "Yeah, this is what we do."  We took over.  We took over the Treasurer's Office one time because they didn't have our stipends.  We took the checkwriting machines so the school would have to come to a screeching halt until we got our money, and we got our money.  You know.
Speaker 1: So is this 1970 or '71 [1971]?
Speaker 2: '70 [1970], yeah.
Speaker 1: '70 [1970], okay.
Story_ID: 18593
Speaker 1: Tell us about what was significant about the BC [Boston College, Boston, Massachusetts] experience and your going.  I mean you're away from, you're away from home.
Speaker 2: Which didn't bother me.
Speaker 1: No.  We just--I mean.
Speaker 2: It was--no, it didn't bother me.  You know, people would think you'd be homesick.  Not really.  It was intellectually challenging.  It was fun.  It was--the black students had brought in--of our class, which I think were about eighty, about twenty of us graduated on time.  What had happened was that a wonderful man who I call my godfather who was really the Dean of Black Students at that time, A. Robert Phillips, literally had just gone out and admitted folks and just used the authority he had to just admit folks, folks.  I mean we actually had a couple pimps and prostitutes in our class, too, who used the dormitory for their activities, but--and they didn't last long, but, you know, his argument was that if people were exposed, some of them who might not ordinarily get there would be there, would grow and revel from the experience, and some did, and I would argue that even if you went to college for a year, and you hadn't planned to go at all, then you're better off.  At the end of the day, you really are better off so it was very heady.  A. Robert resigned over some imbroglio, and we took over the program so we ran the Black Talent Program.  The students ran it for like two or three years, and I was always sort of in the thick of things as--I believe at one point I was the Director of Academics, which meant that I could recommend that my peers be put out of school if their grades weren't good enough.  Of course, we erred on the side of leniency, but I remember someone making the argument that they had only passed one class three semesters in a row.  I said "Oh, no, you've got to go," and they said "Well, you're not being lenient," and I said "At the rate you're going, if you pass one class a semester and it's required that you pass thirty-eight classes to get out, you will be fifty [years old], and you will still be in school."  And that didn't go over well, but in any case we took over literally the functions of the office, so it was empowering.  It was, you know, heady.  I lived in a dorm for, I think, a year and a half, and then I was on my own, got my own space, bought a car when I was a sophomore.  Yep.  Was working, just did my thing.
Speaker 1: Was Boston--did you like it as a place to be at school?
Speaker 2: For a minute.  I liked it for the first couple of years of undergraduate school.  Then I didn't like it anymore.  The racism in Boston was like nothing I had ever experienced.  The white people there are cut from southern cloth.  I mean, these are true and utter redneck white people who are--I mean, if you look at South Boston and you look at Roxbury [Massachusetts] and you do the demographics, they're the same.  They're poor white people who are--have not been to college a lot, who have little participation in some of the decision-making in their communities, but they, instead of being mad at City Hall, they were mad at black people.  Then you had the 'Queen of the Nine Chins,' Louise Day Hicks, who had run for the school board and had said "Over her dead body would black people go to school in Boston, in South Boston," and I'm saying like "Give me something I don't want.  Your dead body could be very easily produced."  You know, this is not--but she was gonna lay out in front of the buses and so the buses would not roll over her.  Hmm, but yeah, you had that so the '75 [1975]--really '75 [1975] is probably the year, '75 [1975], '76 [1976].  The racism in Boston was just like ugh.  I was in graduate school by then, but at that point I did not like Boston.  It was a hard place to be because you could just very easily wander into a racist situation and find yourself threatened.  You would have a white classmate who'd invite you to go somewhere to eat, and you couldn't go to the better Italian restaurants in the North End because you'd be spat on or beaten.  We had classmates who would go--the cheaper housing was in these ethnic white neighborhoods, and you'd go to study somewhere and come back.  Your tires would be slashed.  That, and it just wasn't, you know, it wasn't pleasant.
Story_ID: 18594
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask first about why you went on--you got your degree in economics--,
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and then you went on with the master's program there [at Boston College, Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: What were your thoughts about what you wanted to do at this time, you know, career-wise, and why did you pursue, you know, your master's then?
Speaker 2: Well, I was finished with college in three years, and I couldn't get out so that was something to do for my fourth year.  I wasn't sure whether I wanted to do economics or law or journalism.  I think I might have even applied for a graduate school in political science and public policy.  I mean, I knew that I wanted to do something with public policy.  I knew that I wanted to do something that improved the lives of black people.  It seemed to me that economics, you know, is about allocation, the allocation of scarce resources, and so it seemed to me from that perspective that that would be a place for me to make a contribution.  I mean I flirted with law and flirted hard with it, but I think my line when I pledged about half of those folks were going to law school, and just my basic need to be different said "If everybody else is going to law school, I'm not.  I'll do economics then."
Speaker 1: And were there people that you admired, you know, economists that you admired that you wanted to emulate or that were influencing you or?
Speaker 2: I didn't really know any then.  I mean by my junior year I met Margaret Simms who at the time was--she's an economist at the Joint Center [The Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, Washington, D.C.].  At the time she was a Ph.D. student at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California], and I met Sam Myers who now is at the University of Minnesota [Minneapolis, Minnesota] who was a graduate student at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  Sam was among the early African Americans to attend MIT's graduate program, and he was basically on a mission of any African American he found who had even a sliver of interest in economics, he was gonna get them over to MIT, but I didn't know any, and I think my sophomore year, the summer of my sophomore year, I worked for the Black Economic Research Center [in New York City] which no longer exists.  Bob Browne was the head of that, and I just thought he was the most wonderful person.  I thought he walked on water.  A guy named John Handy who's now at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] was a student there then.  Stephanie Wilson who's at Abt Associates [economic consulting firm in Cambridge, Massachusetts].  There was a group of young women--me, Stephanie, a woman named Barbara Britton who's the Director of Advertising at 'Essence' [magazine] now, and Michelle Graves who I believe does banking in the Midwest, and we worked for David Swinton, who's now the President at Benedict College [Columbia, South Carolina].  David was like--he used to lock us in the basement because when we come to work, we're in hot pants with our stomachs out, and he just thought this was entirely too indecent to be walking down 125th Street [in New York], you know, looking like you were whatever, you know, a working girl so he would lock us in the basement, and we'd do things like bring caftans to work and walk around.  We were the sisters of the African whatever, and as soon as he turned his back, we'd whip those things off, and we're ready to go but taught us some good stuff just about methodology, but people like David were--I mean David, I think, is probably within ten years of my age, and Margaret.  We saw them more as like not people to--not like role model types, just like interesting people who were really, you know, were very accessible, but being at Black Economic Research Center, I remember because John Handy wrote me like a--I aced my first econ [economics] class, and then I started looking into economics, and I'd written the Center, and John Handy wrote me back like a two-page single-spaced letter with all these suggestions about how do you become an economist, and one of the things was that you start attending National Economic Association meetings which is the black economist organization so junior year I started doing that, and, yeah, I really just sort of got into the writing papers, doing this, doing that way of living, and it is kind of a way of living.  It's not the way that I live, but it is a way of living, and for awhile it was something that I found very intriguing, and the first--I guess the economist who has probably had the most impact on my life was Dr. Phyllis Wallace.
Story_ID: 18595
Speaker 1: Well, Dr. Phyllis Wallace was the first African American Woman to get her Ph.D. in economics from Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] in 19 maybe '45 [1945] or '46 [1946].  She came to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] my second year or maybe at the end of my first year.  She had this very, very distinguished career and very interesting career.  I at some point will archive everything, and I'll send you some stuff I've written about her.  I've written a little bit about her but actually had been in the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] and we--it had been rumored that she was in the CIA, but we really didn't know, and then one day I asked her, and she said, "Oh yeah."  I said. "Okay," but because she--of her career time, black folks couldn't work in white institutions, and she--I had a letter.  I hope I still have it.  Who knows, but she had written [U.S. Congressman] Adam Clayton Powell [Jr.] in 1959 and said, "I'm a Negro economist desirous of employment with the federal government," and she ended up with at the CIA translating Russian, and you know, 'cause they had all these input output models, and that's what she really basically translated, and it had all these impacts on her life that are fascinating, and one day I want to do more full-length work on her.  The whole issue of intellectual biographies is something, if I had unlimited time, that I would spend some time doing, which is what I find intriguing about your project.  It's sort of how people who do stuff think and whatever, but anyway she--Dr. Wallace came to MIT maybe in '74 [1974].  She was in the business school, and at some point she issued an invitation to myself and Linda Datcher, who is Glen Loury's wife and was in my class at MIT, to come and have dinner with her, and she basically mentored both of us, and she and I--I mean people--she was my mom.  She was my intellectual--I mean my own mom [Proteone Alexandria Malveaux] is certainly--has been an intellectual role model as well, but Phyllis was just a gentle guiding force, always sort of there, and she influenced me.  She was a labor economist, and that's where my early academic research was on the labor market.  Most--if you talk to many African American economists, I think those who got degrees before 1985, you'll probably find nearly half have done some work in the labor area.  That's probably less true of younger economists, but that certainly was true then so Phyllis--she influenced me greatly, although certainly I didn't take her path.  I mean she--but then again she didn't take her path either.  I mean she had a very interesting path that ended her up at MIT, but she probably--if I were to say who really pushed me or shaped, she.
Story_ID: 18596
Speaker 1: When do you think you decided you wanted to be an economist?  Do you think it was at the time you say I'm applying to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or was it, you know, when you were doing your master's program?  I'm just wondering.
Speaker 2: You know, I mean I think the issue of economic research became intriguing to me after maybe about sophomore year and I had taken more economics classes, and it became--just,you know I always say it sort of--you know, if you look at allocation of resources, that's the biggest issue that faces African American people.  If you look at a neoclassical economic model that talked about people being paid rents or rates of return on a set of factors of production, then you can go back in history and really tell why you end up with these gaps because we didn't have access to all the production factors, and if you care about issues of distribution and wealth, it at some point becomes quite intriguing, and then as you start to look at patterns of employment and both the macro patterns that come from just looking at data and kind of the micro patterns that come from looking at history, then to me it's like totally absorbing.  Now fortunately or unfortunately, I mean I could spend all my time doing academic research.  I also happen to have sort of this media bug and write a column and love doing TV [television] stuff so those are two--those require two very different kinds of, you know, preparation, et cetera, and at some point I've been bitten by the political bug, and that's a whole other story, but so, you know--but when you look at some of the pattern, I mean it's fascinating stuff.  You go back in and pull out the data from the 400-some occupations that government classifies, and you look at what percentage is African American, what percentage is white, and then how that breaks down by male, female, and you look at the kind of stories you can tell about what institutional things made these things happen, and it just becomes quite intriguing, and, you know, you can--why do you have so many black women, for example, working in the post office?  Well, you know Ph.D.s worked in the post office back in the day, and when you look at certain stamp--certain science fields and you see the differences.  Often because the base is so small, you can attribute our presence to an act of generosity or justice depending on how you wanna look at one or two people.  You know, it's fascinating, and the ways that one can permute it I think are just sort of limitless.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And so.
Story_ID: 18597
Speaker 1: So you finish MIT, and what are you--what do you do at that point?
Speaker 2: Well, after my third year at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], I came to work in the [President Jimmy] Carter White House [Washington, D.C.] as a Junior Staff Economist with the Council of Economic Advisors, and so that's the policy bug, and that's when the policy bug sort of bit me, and as I did that, I also was working on my dissertation and went to the Rockefeller Foundation after my year at the White House to--as a visiting research fellow and to finish my dissertation, which was on unemployment differentials by race and occupation.  I spent two years there and then went to the New School [New School University for Social Research, New York, New York] and taught for a year, wasn't--I don't know, and then went back to San Francisco [California], and I wasn't crazy about it.  It was fun, but it wasn't.  I was teaching in the Graduate School of Management/Urban Professions so it wasn't quite a standard econ [economics] job.  I think at the time I had a great offer at University of Wisconsin [Madison, Wisconsin] and was dating somebody in New York and was kind of like--and New York was much more interesting than Madison, Wisconsin.  I had been involved civically in a couple of arts boards and enjoyed that and so sort of said I'll stay around and then sort of thought better of the decision and ended up going home to San Francisco to teach at San Francisco State [University] and to write for the San Francisco 'Sun-Reporter' which is a black newspaper, and to sniff around and think about politics.
Speaker 1: And where did the politics come in?  Was it from your early leanings or I mean?
Speaker 2: A combination of my early leanings, my love of public speaking, the policy analysis piece, and the time that I spent at the White House, really seeing how random factors could shape legislative initiatives, that your interest in something could make something happen.  You could throw a rider or an amendment into a piece of legislation, and suddenly we never had the Ryan White AIDS Bill [Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act, 1990], for example, that someone was interested in AIDS and Ryan White was a very visible death, that you know, I think in the late '70s [1970s] you often got health, you know, health or other kinds of things because some individual was interested in that, and it seemed to me that if you wanted to talk about economic justice as well as issues around women that--you know, legislators who were fully grounded in policy would be effective.  Yep.
Story_ID: 18598
Speaker 1: That's true so what did you want to do with politics?
Speaker 2: Well, I wanted to be a [U.S] congressperson at one point, but I ran for the Board of Supervisors in San Francisco [California], got my butt beat, didn't take it well, you know, kind of pouted, was active with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], was president of the Black Leadership Forum which is--and ran and probably should have run again, but, you know, did one of my usual, you know, six and one-half this, that, this, that, this, that, and ended up, you know, getting a syndicated column and deciding to focus more on my writing and that piece of what I was doing but ran for the board [Board of Supervisors, San Francisco, California] and had a fun campaign, learned a lot, learned a lot about public presentation, and probably that was the experience that gave me exposure to begin to do something in radio and TV [television] and other stuff that I was doing, but I had this clique at one point in time when I went to an academic conference in San Francisco.  It must have been like the Western Economics Association [Western Economic Association International], and I was just--I was a discussant on a panel which means you didn't prepare a paper, but someone is responding to your paper, and I was very excited because I had gotten my first piece in 'U.S.A. Today' [newspaper], and one of my friends said, "Well, this is the wrong crowd for that," you know. 'Cause I said, "Y'all see my piece in 'U.S.A. Today'?"  And everybody was like--you know, "Did you read the papers?"  You know, so it was sort of like this clique.  Okay, well, you're gonna be juggling this stuff probably for the rest of your life between doing the public consumption stuff and the more academic stuff.
Speaker 1: And see and so you've really sort of created your own path in many ways.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: Well, let me ask you are you happy with the mix between the academic and, you know, sort of--I call it pop economist?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Pop economist.
Speaker 1: I like what I do.  I feel extraordinarily blessed.  I'm not like the most entrepreneurial person in the world, but I do have an entrepreneurial streak so that I'm able to package and repackage myself to make, you know, a good living.  I love to talk so when you pay me to talk, you--I mean please.  As my mother said, "You shouldn't pay her.  She might talk for free."  She's lying, but, you know, that to me is fulfilling.  To be able to travel around the country as a lecturer and just really see how people live all over the country and some of the issues, I think it's just an absolute blessing.  I mean I do really feel very, very blessed.  Now there are times certainly that I think the work that I do has its challenges.  Sometimes I wish I did have a network position or something so that when you had a hot story, you knew that you had some place to take it.  I don't always have that, and as my column is weirdly distributed, I'm not with King Features Syndicate anymore so I'm waiting to find a new syndicate so meanwhile we've got about a dozen papers that we syndicate to.  It's--you know, you're always juggling.  My company does some training, some diversity training.  I've worked with any number of Fortune 50 companies and done really transformative work, and I'm very proud of that, but, you know, as I approach fifty, I certainly wonder, you know.  Should I go get a 'real job,' and what kind of actual contribution, I mean, that you make?  Now so I get gratified when people say, "So you've made that point for me," or "You did that," because I think that, you know, you always do--I mean what does Ecclesiastes--when they say (paraphrasing), "Those to whom much is given, much is expected." [Luke 12:48].  You always want to have the notion of your giving back in front of your mind.  Cecelia Bryant [Reverend Dr. Cecelia Williams Bryant], who I don't know if you know her, she's someone you might want to interview as well, a wonderful woman, was at St. Paul's [African Methodist Episcopal] Church in Cambridge [Massachusetts].  Remember St. Paul's?
Speaker 2: Um hmm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  She was there with John Bryant [Reverend John R. Bryant, Bishop of the Fifth District, African Methodist Episcopal Church] and Juvester Jamal's mother, Jamal [Reverend Jamal-Harrison Bryant], the young brother who was at the NAA- [NAACP, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and now has his own church [Empowerment Temple African Methodist Episcopal Church, Baltimore, Maryland]?  She says you can't consider yourself a success unless you've replicated yourself seven times, and you know part of the reason that like LaToya is here.  I don't think I'm gonna replicate myself, but you want to make sure that you provide young folks with the exposure that you were once provided and that perhaps some of them decide they wanna do something similar to what you're doing.  Some of them see it as an experience that perhaps, you know, think about it one day like when she's writing a paper and say, "Aha, she told me I was gonna have to write," you know, something like that.
Story_ID: 18599
Speaker 1: But in many ways you are almost--you've done for the field of economy, whatever, economist.
Speaker 2: Economics, yeah.
Speaker 1: Economics.  You've done for that field what Dr. Alvin Poussaint did for psychology because he, you know, he popularized in many ways and made it, you know, and that does--and you're taking a very technical area and making it accessible.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: From a black perspective.
Speaker 2: Um hmm.
Speaker 1: And so that's, you know, he was writing in 'Ebony' [magazine].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, you know, popularized it, and so that's what, you know, I sort of see you doing, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, that's the attempt.
Speaker 1: You know, modern-day version of doing that.
Speaker 2: That's part of the attempt, and you also want us to not think of economic issues as unattainable.  I mean the thing I hate the most ever, ever is I'll meet someone at a cocktail party or an event, and I'll say, "I'm an economist."  "Oh, I flunked that in college."  Why would you share that with me?  Do you find that amusing?  I mean, do you want to put "I flunked that in college."  I just don't find that particularly amusing, and I--you know, maybe it's an icebreaker or a conversation piece, but it shouldn't be.  I mean we shouldn't be proud of flunking economics, and when I taught, I mean I really worked very hard.  I actually used the newspaper as a teaching tool when I taught so that they had to do these news analysis, and they'd say, "Well, do we have to go to the business section?"  But if you believe that the allocation of scarce resources is what economics is about, you can go to the comic page.  You know, we're looking at how people make allocation decisions.  In a capitalist economy you primarily make those decisions by the use of the dollar, but then what's hidden when you only use the dollar to make allocation decisions so, you know, I just used the paper because everybody reads the paper or everybody doesn't.  This is a problem, too, but everybody should read the paper, and this is a way that before you get to the charts and graphs, you actually begin to think in allocation terms.
Story_ID: 18600
Speaker 1: But see, the thing is all that person is really saying to you is that "I find it intimidating in some respects," you know.  Economics has not been part of the black experience, even though we've been subject to it.  It's not been part of our, you know--.
Speaker 2: Well, subject and participant.  You know, I used to teach a class called Black Economic History at UC [University of California] Berkeley [Berkeley, California] because we do--you can go back and find our full participation in economic institutions, both as objects of commerce but also as actors in commerce.  I mean one of the most poignant things I think about when I think about in history is those of us who bought ourselves.  I mean that's a phrase that is almost impossible for me to repeat without, you know, shivers just going, but imagine the entrepreneurship of someone, the entrepreneurship and the discipline of someone who was willing to literally purchase themselves.  Juliet Walker is an economic historian in Illinois.  She's getting a lot of play now 'cause she has this Oprah class [at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Illinois] that everyone's talking about, but one of her books, 'Free Frank,' is about her great-great-great-grandfather, and she tells a story about how he purchased himself and then purchased his wife and then had to purchase his children, you know, and--but that was literally mastering the laws of supply and demand and manipulating the laws of supply and demand.  I'm not--we all didn't buy ourselves, of course.  I mean this probably represented two or three percent of the slaves at any point in time who were involved in the process of doing that, and there are horrible stories about those slaves and what happened.  I mean some were being--usually what they would do is be allowed to hire themselves out, you know, a day, a week, or something like that so that they then could keep their wage and use that wage to pay.  Oftentimes the person who they were hired out with would pay their master directly.  Sometimes these masters often were unscrupulous.
Story_ID: 18601
Speaker 1: So anyway you were--we were talking about.
Speaker 2: We were talking about 'Free Frank,' [book by Juliet E.K. Walker] and I mean we really--'Free Frank' is an important story because it is symbolic really.  'Free Frank' is very, very symbolic of how many African American people were agents and active in the economic system, and then you go even further back and you look at the 1850s, and what's his name?  William Leidesdorff who was the treasurer of San Francisco [California] has a street named after him in Wall Street [in New York], had been a Wall Street broker so you had the participation of some free blacks.  Some of them were free because they were the offspring of, you know, influential white people.  Some of them were free because they had been freed after a death.  You had this whole group of whites who inherited slaves, enjoyed them, but then freed them at their death.  They knew it was wrong, but they didn't want to be inconvenienced too badly, and so you really did have commercial involvement on our part.  Then if you go look at the development of all of our colleges, the HBCUs [Historically Black Colleges and Universities], especially those that were church-related, and you think about all the bake sales and everything that made these things happen.  I mean we shouldn't see ourselves as people--I mean if we're at the periphery of the economic system, it's because of issues of access, but we've never been at the periphery in terms of a failure to be entrepreneurs, but at the same--what my analysis--you look at the post-Civil War period, many black men by law were prevented from owning the tools of their trade because the craftspeople, the blacksmiths and all that, had been African American.  They'd been trained on the plantations.  Now they're free, and they're competing with guess what?  White folks.  So you pass a law that said you can't own a blacksmithery.  In some states you had laws that said you couldn't have more than a certain amount of dollars or a certain amount of land, and you know, I think that those kinds of laws dampened some of our participation, but even still--I mean you just go through.  Look at Madame [C.J.] Walker and her phenomenal effort.  You know, go through and look at those things.  We need to understand that stuff a lot better.  You know, we need to more clearly understand and also understand that when we go back--one of the things I love about Ghana--it can be frustrating, but I love it, too--is the fact everybody over there is an entrepreneur.  They have no choice.  Their currency has been so devalued.  So much has happened that everybody is selling something--water, fruit, yams, clothing--but you see people as--if you can't make a living with the formal labor market, then you will find a way with the informal labor market so I--probably one of the things that I regret that I haven't done is more writing about our economic history, the understanding of just where we've been and teaching it.  You really do--you've got to make the point that we have always been economic actors.
Story_ID: 18602
Speaker 1: Now economics, of course, the thing that we forget is economics is not a science.  People want to act as if economics is something very exact.  You've got people's preferences, and you've got politics that shape many economic conditions, and so you'll find out, for example, again back to my [President Jimmy] Carter White House experience, remember that they passed some legislation, but they had some input quota for something called rutile.  Now I'm an urban so I didn't know what rutile was.  It's a form of hemp, but at the time it was only grown in like one area in a part of Texas, and this area suddenly got a windfall because they were the subject of a piece of legislation that said the rutile is to be treated a certain way so when you start looking at the price of rutile, what would explain it?  Well, that legislation, and so that's another--you know, you really look at the political economy, and there is a nexus between politics and economics, and you see it working frankly for white folks everyday.  There's now this Internet Freedom Act [Internet Tax Freedom Act, 1997] that is being discussed in [U.S.] Congress.  It will--there's been a five-year moratorium on taxing--no, a three-year moratorium so far on taxation on the Internet.  Now this means that states cannot collect revenue because you go and buy your books from Amazon [Internet book store].  If you bought 'em up the street, you'd have to pay eight percent tax.  Well, now there's a conversation about whether or not this moratorium should be extended another five years.  Well, what's bad about it?  What's bad about it is the homies are not buying on Amazon, and so if the state is not able to collect the money from the spenders, it gets transferred to the other people so everybody else ends up taking the (unclear).  Personally I love shopping on the Internet.  The last few weddings that I've had to go to--Internet gifts, and I just went to a baby shower, and I hate baby stores.  I don't know why, but I just--you know, it's just all the stuff so I got the baby shower gift on the Internet.  I was happier than a clam.  I said, "Okay, click, click, click, point, send," you know, and it worked, but, you know, it's a convenience, but it's also a convenience that says that those who have access are the ones who are being advantaged, and it's political, and nobody is--I won't say nobody 'cause Maxine [Maxine Waters, U.S. House of Representatives, California]--you've got one of the best advocates out there, but few people--most people look at this legislation and say it's race neutral.  If you have a digital divide, it's not race neutral.  This tax falls more heavily on us.
Story_ID: 18603
Speaker 1: Let me ask you.  What do you think a current day--you know, you write a lot about it, but what things do you think the black community needs to address, you know, from an economic standpoint, and what are the key areas?  You talk about the intersection of politics, you know, and economics, but what are the other areas that you think are important?  You've talked about home health care workers, you know, and that whole bit, but I'm just wondering if you could go over, you know, some of your--.
Speaker 2: I think one of the biggest issues now is the issue of the accumulation of wealth.  If you look at incomes, we've come--for people with college educations who are under thirty-five, we've come relatively close to income parity.  People are within ten percent of each other in terms of income.  Aggregatively I think African Americans earn about sixty percent of what whites do, but when you control for education and occupation and other stuff, you get the gap down so there's still issues with that, too, because we have more single moms, etcetera, etcetera, but you get the gap down so in terms of saying, "Prepare yourself for the labor market," which I think we have to continue to say to young people.  Our college attendance rates are not quite what they should be at all, but preparation gets you a good income, but what do we do about the accumulation of wealth, and that's an issue that I think we need to pay some attention to.  I think Reverend [Jesse] Jackson's Wall Street Project, some of the work that Hugh Price is doing with the [National] Urban League, and indeed the resurgent movement for reparations are all about looking at how you close the wealth gap because the wealth gap is more important than the income gap because it's more permanent.  If you look at something as simple as home ownership, seventy-one percent of white people own their homes compared to forty-six percent of African Americans and Latinos.  Now for middle-income people, the route to wealth accumulation is generally home ownership, and the equity that's generated through home ownership provides people with the financial flexibility to begin to do things like send their kids to college without having to go out of pocket.  They can get a home equity loan for that.  You know, I hate to use this example, but I always do.  You get racially profiled, and suddenly you've gotta come up with bail.  Well, some people have spent a year in jail because their family couldn't come up with bail.  If you own a home, you've got again that home equity.  Now don't try to get the home equity for everything at the same time, but I mean you've got that home equity there to deal with that so I mean why do you have a home ownership gap?  Part of it is that we have lower incomes.  Part of it also is there remains discrimination in the housing markets, remains--ACORN [Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now] has done really great work just looking at turn-down rates and things like that.  I mean I can even tell you stories about my own home loan, and I mean I'm not broke, but when I bought this house, I was told by a lender if I were a man, I could have my loan immediately.  It's the whole question of "If I got sick, who's gonna pay my mortgage?"  I said "Well, if a man gets sick, who's gonna pay his?" You know.  And it chafes me to no end to look at my mortgage, and it says "Julianne Malveaux, an unmarried woman."  I'm like, "None of your business," you know.  "I'm Julianne Malveaux who pays the mortgage."  That's what it oughta say, you know, but the wealth issue is extremely important.  I mean part of it is internal.  Part of it is external.  The internal part is that obviously we have to say we have to do this, we have to do that, but the external is if the playing field is not level, how do you make it level?
Story_ID: 18604
Speaker 1: I think the interest in reparations is that people have been playing by the rules, and the game is still slanted, and so you say, "Well, what's the big problem?"  Well, part of it is the wealth piece so you go back and try to unpack the wealth piece, and all these little bitty so-called affirmative action programs that people keep attacking have not done a whole heck of a lot.  They've done some things to obtain some access, but an 8A program [Federal Business Development Program] or minority business set-aside creates a few millionaires.  What are we going to do to create more?  Well, the third thing ,and I don't know if it's the third or the second.  It's very important.  I think we keep forgetting.  It's the piece about poverty.  It's why I'm doing this documentary on Dr. King's [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] economic legacy.  I mean we can get real caught up in--I mean the question I'm gonna raise with Reverend [Jesse] Jackson is, "How do you get from the Poor People's Campaign [1968] to the Wall Street Project?"  "Cause we can all get real caught up in this issue of wealth, especially when you have these ghetto-fabulous folks walking around making ten million, twelve million [dollars], whatever.  We still have--what is it--twenty-five percent of our population is poor, ten million people earning the minimum wage, five dollars and fifteen cents an hour, so really at some level--and this is kind of probably where I will part with the civil rights establishment of a bit--we have to look at issues of economic structure and to what extent exploitation is a necessary condition of capitalism, and if there is going to be exploitation, how come it has to be us?  But the how come it has to be us is almost a footnote.  Really we need to be stuck on is there exploitation?  That's the broad movement that Dr. King was working on when he died, how the Poor People's Campaign was for white people, black people, Latinos, native people because who do you find on the--who is on the bottom and how are their life chances impacted?  I mean we are--he has this great quote.  He says, "Well, when you look at--"--he said, "There are 40,000,000 poor people in America, and when you see 40,000,000 poor people, you have to ask yourself why are there 40,000,000 people?"  And then you ask a question about the basis of the economic structure.  You see, as Dr. King says, "Who owns the oil?  Who owns the iron ore?  If the world is two-thirds water, why should we pay water bills?"  He says, "Why is it that we pay water bills in a world that's two-thirds water?"  That's one of my favorite King quotes.  I'm like, "Don't send it to the water company, but if the world is two-thirds water, why do we pay water bills?"  In other words, "What are we doing about making sure that there's a floor below which no American should go?" And we're not doing anything.  As a matter of fact, in some sense we're exploiting--I mean exporting exploitative conditions to other places, but I mean in terms of our economic agenda, there really is some--and you can go through and look at the business piece.  I think it boils down to wealth and poverty.  Really, you would want to boil it down to wealth and economic discrimination, the extent to which economics discrimination still exists and the extent to which we're really prepared to fight it, and I think we've gotten timid in the '80s [1980s] and '90s [1990s] in terms of litigation.  I mean although we have the very visible Johnnie Cochrans of the world who do just wonderful things, I think at the same time you are discriminated against.  Many of us individually are reluctant to become a poster child.  I mean you've got a good life, you've got a nice job, you're driving two cars, you don't want to stand outside and say, you know, "My employer discriminated against me," because guess what?  You're gonna get blackballed, but you know what else?  You're gonna create a situation where it won't happen again so the agenda is a long one, and we can--as I said--but you distill it to be--distill it to wealth and poverty.

Speaker 1: Okay, what about the black church, the role of--when you look at, you know, our low-income areas, you see two sources of money, and that's really drugs and, you know, and the black church, and I wonder from an economist's standpoint, what views do you have of that?
Speaker 2: I think the black church has been very irresponsible.  I think it's an enduring institution in our community.  Still, unlike most Americans, probably sixty percent or seventy percent of us have some relationship with the church.  We may not all be members, but we go or Aunt Minnie goes or somebody goes, and we're there a few times a year.  The church can really do teaching about economic development in ways that I think it has not, and instead I think there's been this whole megachurch movement that has been really about enriching a few ministers and creating--they say they're creating all this stuff, but I wanna see what's happening with congregations, and I get a bit worried.  I think about the parable of the talents in biblical terms when in Matthew, you know, the farmer goes away and he leaves one person with five talents and one with two and one with one, and he tells them to go take care of his money, and the one with the five and the one with the two multiplied their talents, and the one with the one buried it, and when the guy comes back, he says good job, good job, "You're a fool."  Not quite what the Bible says, but, you know, we paraphrase here, and I think of the black church as the "You're a fool."  I mean you have all these people coming in.  Why aren't we teaching people how to really be stewards of what God has given them because whether you're a welfare mom who's taking home $600 a month and trying to scrape by or you're the CEO [Chief Executive Officer] type who's got six figures and trying to scrape by because, you know, American debt is at an all-time high now, and we're a big part of it.  If you look at every financial instrument that exists, the only place you'll find equivalency between white and black folks is in credit card debt, not in stock and bond ownership, not in land ownership, but in credit card debt, which is crazy, but why aren't churches doing more about our financial responsibility?  Oh, they'll tell you to tithe.  They will tell you to tithe, but why not teach people how not only to tithe to God but also to tithe to themselves?  Why not begin to bring--we used to see neighborhoods like this one which are just turning.  This used to be a black neighborhood, but they're turning.  How come we can't get someone to teach folks how to cooperatively buy property?  I mean, there are so many things I think the church should do.  Now there are many who say that their job is the saving of souls, but it's not money that's the root of all evil.  It's lack of money.  Actually, of course, in the Bible it's love of money.
Story_ID: 18606
Speaker 1: What do you think is gonna be necessary to put in place for us to, you know, thrive and not survive?
Speaker 2: I think that African American people need to feel as if we have access to everything in this society, that there are no barriers and no boundaries, and I think that the boundaries have come two ways.  We have a set of boundaries that are imposed on us, less so now, but they still exist.  They're either imposed by signs, and the signs aren't sitting out there saying white or colored anymore but imposed by signs.  By that I mean do you go to the country club?  Are you in the United States Senate?  What kind of signals does life send you about what's possible, what you can create a possibility about so I think that that's external, but then there's an internal piece, too.  The internal piece is the piece where we accept the stereotypes, I mean where--you know, white people say, "Black people don't play golf."  Excuse me, there is Tiger Woods [professional golfer] or tennis, [professional tennis players Venus and Serena] the Williams girls, or you know, "Black people don't" or, you know, "I've never met a black economist before."  Please.  You know, it's a way of accepting the notion that we have limitations as opposed to getting out of the box and really just saying, "We claim everything that life has to offer and everything that this country has.  Not only do we claim it, we demand it, and not only do we demand it, but we're willing to fight for it," so I think it's a mind-set change and gets you off of that shuffling along and gets you into that sort of striding boldly.  Beyond that, I think we have to raise questions about what do we mean by thriving.  I mean if thriving means that we all have to be millionaires, then we're never gonna thrive, but should we all be millionaires?  Some of us don't have those kind of pecuniary needs.  We perhaps wanna be social workers, and then we have to raise questions about what does our society value, and are we willing to fight about that because I think it's just pathetic that you have people taking care of our grandmothers who earn minimum wage.  I mean when people earn the minimum, they're not happy.  You know, this--you get these old women dropped in nursing homes.  Why were they dropped?  Because the person who dropped them was making five dollars an hour, and she was not a happy camper, you know, so if when we begin to start talking about human needs being important, then we need to reward the people who do human service work, you know, teachers, teachers, nurses, social workers, those typically female jobs that our mothers and grandmothers, if they were professional help, and these jobs have sort of been tarnished in the public view, and they need to be as important as being a member of [U.S.] Congress or a basketball player, you know, for that matter, and so that then gives us some work in terms of structuring.  That's not just work for the black community, but it's really work for what Dr. King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] would call the 'Beloved Community,' for all of us to do.  We really think that these things are important.  I don't want people watching children who are trying to figure out where they're gonna get their next meal from because that's a condition for them to turn around and ignore the child.  They're not happy.  Why are they going to make a child happy or encourage a child to thrive so the question of what thriving means is a question I think that as a society we owe ourselves a dialogue about, and as we have that kind of dialogue, that we begin to deal, you know, with our responsibilities as Americans in a world where we snarf up most of the resources and put out most of the misery.  In other words, I'm looking at our connections between other countries, especially developing countries, and what kind of conditions our behavior engenders in those places, but--.
Story_ID: 18607
Speaker 1: You know, let's go back to reparations.  You were saying that you, you know, you believed in reparations, and you have several different theories, you know, about how it could be accomplished.
Speaker 2: Well, I think reparations are just about paying.  Our country--we--black people provided unwaged labor for this country for two centuries, and we have not been paid for it.  People were caught up in the fine points of can you prove it?  Some of us can, and some of us can't 'cause guess what?  It was in your interest, white folks, not to keep those kinds of records, and often you didn't.  Are all white people here now descendants of slaveholders?  No, they absolutely aren't.  Many came here.  The biggest influx of immigrant population came in 1900 to 1915, you know, pre-World War I area--area--era, but that's when we got our biggest influx of immigrant populations, Irish, Italians, Poles, et cetera.  No, they weren't slaveholders, but the reality of slavery advantaged them vis-a-vis the competition with black people for scarce work, and so they still were beneficiaries, and so I think it's a national debt that the country owes, and I would simply impose a tax on certain entities and provide tax credits to certain people, and that is one way of offering reparations.  I think, too, and I think Randall [Randall Robinson] makes that point so very well.  There needs to be some notion of what slavery was about on the Mall [in Washington D.C.].  We need to make sure that this is something that is never forgotten.  I mean the [Jewish] Holocaust did not happen here, but it's sitting there, and I do not begrudge that because the Holocaust was a horrible thing, but we, too, survived a Holocaust.  The last time I went to Ghana, I went to Elmina Castle [slave trading post] again.  It was like my third trip there, and I don't--sometimes I don't even know why I go, but this last time was especially wonderful.  I went, got a young brother named Clifford Ashune who goes to the University of Cape Coast as my guide, and we asked for a private tour, and the reason I asked for a private tour is that on a previous occasion I had gone, and some ignorant white woman opined aloud that "Slavery was probably not that bad," and before I had thought about it, I had just grabbed her, and, you know, I mean I thought--I was like, "What did you say," and she said "Well, what I mean is--."  I didn't want to know what she meant, but I find that in the face of slavery and in the face of all that, I don't want to see white people so I decided that what I would do is get a private tour and for the first time in Elmina really allowed myself to experience some of the pain, but what Clifford said to us was that "For every one of us who made it, four didn't," and just imagine that so, yeah, there's a--and to now portray Africa as a debtor nation.  No, Africa is at the basis of the development of civilization all over the world, you know, in Europe, you know, in England because they built their empires from what was happening in the Caribbean.  You know, here in the United States, our Capitol built by slaves so--that stuff needs to be documented, but people also need to get paid, and then we need--because you see the outcome, and the outcome is a wealth gap.  You could argue anything you want to along the way, but when you end up with a wealth gap, the wealth gap is the result of wealth accumulation on the part of some people and the denial of wealth accumulation opportunities for other people so as I say, a tax.  I mean you see these insurance companies who had insured slaves, and if the slaves ran away, they paid.  Tax them.  Allstate [insurance company]--you could go down the list, and then provide an implicit subsidy.
Story_ID: 18608
Speaker 1: In addition, provide subsidies for things like home ownership and education for young African Americans.  Now there's an economist who--I gotta look for this book upstairs.  He has an interesting idea.  It doesn't have to do with black people, but he suggests that every young person in the United States should get about $100,000 at the end of their high school period to be used for education, growing a business, starting a family, or whatever they want, and he doesn't allude to reparations at all, but it's an interesting concept.  Basically I was talking to a friend about it and said "Well, you know this is something we could pull, because obviously in the United States--how many black congresspeople do we have?"  "Not enough to vote for reparations," so--and I don't know how much persuasion it would take for us to get these devils to do the right thing, but some notion of that kind of situation also is one where at least we could see young people, young African Americans, getting a leg up.  You know, what if the white kids get a leg up, too?  I don't really care, but I want to make sure our young people get a leg up.  More and more of them come out of college with all this debt because they're paying their own way or they're taking out these loans.  Yeah, the scholarship money was there when we were students.  It's not there anymore, you know, so I see something like that as something that could be explored intellectually as a way of doing something, and then finally putting together some form or foundation kind of thing that might say you had some chit that could be cashed at pivotal points and times in your life when the issues of the wealth gap are most poignantly clear for you.  I mean, I bought my first home when I was forty-three years old.  I had peers who were buying their first homes when they were thirty-five 'cause their parents were able to give them, you know, twenty, thirty, $50,000.  My folks couldn't do that for me.  I mean they gave me everything else, you know, including the encouragement to do whatever I needed to do, but you know, if I was sitting there saying, "Yo," it wasn't happening, and that's the difference in terms of home ownership opportunities between young whites and young African Americans so I see this as a combination of those kinds of things happening to say, "Let's close the gap."
Story_ID: 18609
Speaker 1: What about the things that--you said there were two approaches to things.  What about the things that black people need to do for themselves?  What are your views on that subject?  You know, you were saying there were two sides.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Boundaries that were created, you know, around us and there were boundaries that we.
Speaker 2: That we created.  Well, I think that obviously that the issue of financial responsibility--among young black people, you have an awful lot of fatalism of people who don't know how long they're gonna live, you know, so live for today and don't worry about tomorrow, but the whole issue of saving and investment is something that I think we need to continue to preach to younger African Americans, issues of community and how we work together as a community and if we work together as a community.  I think that we need to talk to young African American people about issues of responsibility, and that exhibits itself even if we, you know, are in dire straits economically, "Why is your community blighted?  You can't pick up a piece of paper?  You know, you can't get rid of the graffiti?"  You know, something about going back to, and I don't believe in going back, the sort of 'Once Upon a Time When We Were Colored' [movie] kind of notion of having more pride about that which we do have, and I think that our generation frankly being what I call the golden generation because  of the beneficiaries of the affirmative action unchallenged and college scholarships, many of those folks who had access don't have children, especially among African American women, more people who simply never married and don't have children, and many others at some level don't give back in the way of they've skipped a generation so you've got young greedy folks who basically when you look at a rapper, what is a rapper?  A rapper is a child who was ignored, you know, at some point because some of the language, some of the--you know, it's almost as if you see the relative depravity.  Now part of what's happened, of course, is this whole crack [cocaine] epidemic and what it's done to community, and it is (unclear)--you've never seen black women abandoning their babies the way they've done with this crack thing, and the way that our country has approached the drug epidemic has been to do zero tolerance, but it's, of course, zero tolerance for black people.  In 1995, I believe, one year in the '90s [1990s], not one white person was arrested under federal charges for crack possession in LA [Los Angeles] County [California], not one white person, nary a one.  Now I could find a white person with crack, you know?  Not that I would be looking for one, but you know, what I'm--so you basically have these laws that are used to enforce, basically to contain if you will, black people.  Eight hundred percent incarceration increase among young African American women?  Most of those women not because they were distributing drugs but because they had bad choice in boyfriends.  If everyone who had bad choice in boyfriends had to go to jail, man, the jails would be overflowing, but the point here is that this whole crack thing is something we have to begin, and I think the epidemic is receding, but the consequences of it are not.  You have all these folks in jail, all these folks who as young people feel very, very neglected.
Story_ID: 18610
Speaker 1: I ran into a young brother maybe two years ago at a high school in San Francisco [California], handsome guy, about sixteen, very sort of engaging, the kind of young person you're just immediately attracted to, and, you know, I thought this kid is going places, but his grades were like C grades, and he seemed extremely proud of these Cs, and I said to him "But, honey, you can't go to anybody's college with these Cs," and he said, "Well, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to go to college anyway."  I said "Well, you know--"  I mean he was a great speaker and had all that, you know, charisma, and he said, "Well, you know, I have to help take care of my younger brother and sister," and I said "Well, is that why you're"--he was working forty hours a week.  I said, "Well, why are you working so much?"  His mom was on crack [cocaine], and his activity at the beginning of the month was to race her to the mailbox to get the check first so that the rent could be paid, and he's flipping burgers so that his little sister and little brother could have opportunities.  Now when you have a kid like that and you start talking community and family values to a kid like that, I mean there is an understandable bitterness, and then when you have somebody like me saying, who comes and says, "Gee, why don't you go to college," it all seems very glib.  You haven't really thought through the whole pipeline of how you get from there to there, and I think that more of us need to think that through and begin to create opportunities, and you have two or three black communities.  You have a black middle-class community that only marginally interacts with the rest of black America but will use the rest of black America as a base for whatever they want, and so when you go to California and you look at a piece of legislation on the ballot that says, "Let's get rid of affirmative action," if you're a homey from the 'hood who has not really seen the beneficiaries of affirmative action reaching out to them, why should you care that college opportunities are gonna be restricted when you're not thinking about going to college?  You know, so it's really--there's a lot of internal work that we need to do, and I think the issue and the problem is always for black people you're colliding with--you live in a country where individualism is the most prized trait that people are trained to have, that you go out--the rugged American, you know.  You go out, and you're an individual, and you accomplish, and you achieve, and you're rewarded for that as an individual, a pioneer, but how does the individual interact in a community, and every incentive that America provides is an incentive to behave as an individual and not as a community member, and I think that that's the tension that you see in a post-civil rights era where young people have not been bitten by dogs or--and the images of dog biting are even a generation old.  I mean I wasn't dog-bitten.  The images are a generation old.  They've not seen signs that say "white" or "colored," and they wouldn't see them unless they open up a history book.  Many of them, if they've experienced discrimination, it was shopping discrimination.  Somebody followed them around Eddie Bauer [sporting goods store] so to get someone like that to say, "I care about community," requires the other members of the community to exhibit something to them, and I don't think that that always happens.
Story_ID: 18611
Speaker 1: So what are your--do you have hopes or fears or concerns for the black community going forward?  I mean do you hope?  You have hopes?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I have all of the above.  I mean I think that being African American in this country is to hover somewhere between hope and despair two-thirds of the time because I think the hope piece is always that you see--even as we talk about generations, you see these young people like a (unclear) and folks like that coming up.  You say, "Um hmm," you know.  You see young people.  I was coming from speaking at Benedict College [Columbia, South Carolina] and talking to the kids, and they talked about some of the things they want to do, and, you know, you can generalize, but when you talk to individuals, you really do see, you know, ideas about entrepreneurship, ideas about professional development, young people who want to start childcare centers and old folks homes, and part of their concerns, of course, is, "How am I gonna do this?"  One young sister told me--she was really funny.  She wants to own a childcare center, and she knows it's not gonna make very much money so she needs also to hook up with a broker so, you know, her significant other will be a broker who makes a bunch of money, but she knows she's not gonna make it.  Well, I think I find it interesting to have a young woman articulate that kind of thing and decide, "This is my life plan, and I'm looking for a partner that will enable me to be able to do this which is a giving back kind of thing."  The thing--and you--I don't think that the light ever goes out so that's the hope.  The fear is that you live in white America, that progress is something that oscillates, that the devil is busy, that you've got these Timothy McVeigh [domestic terrorist] people who consider people, human beings, collateral damage, that he probably did not tell who all else was involved with him, that he did this without--it didn't seem a racial motive, but there's these folks like him who do these things racially, that you still have these racial incidents, though, not necessarily always as igniting as a lynching.  When you see a James Byrd dragged to his death [in Jasper, Texas, 1998], you deal with that, and then you have sort of the "Have a Nice Day" discrimination that comes because you're trying to get in the job, and you can't get a foot in the door.  People employ their friends, and with the economic restructuring that we're experiencing, we're gonna have both huge complexes and small businesses and kind of not a lot in between.  The smaller the business by law, the more easy it is for you to discriminate.  Business with fifteen employees is not subject to federal law so you wonder how young black people will make their way.
Story_ID: 18612
Speaker 1: One of the things that we need to be doing is generating more jobs, and I don't see necessarily enough of us attempting to do that.  To say that "One of the reasons I am an entrepreneur is because I can create opportunity for other people," you don't see a lot of people doing that or as many as you'd like to see, and you see a lot of people who have so little historical memory that when you begin to talk about a community, you really have a legitimate question about what that means, but I think that we live--and then the whole technology piece we haven't even talked about, which is a whole other story, just in terms of where we are with the technology and how, but I mean I think that in some you end up just constantly churning a set of concerns, some of which make you smile and give you hope and some which really make you--reinvigorate you and recommit you to the notion of struggle.  I mean what has to happen, at the end of the day the goal has to be to close gaps.  The goal especially has to be to close economic gaps, and we really can't lose sight of that so as we talk about closing gaps, a whole set of public and social policy issues come along with that, and you look at employment and talk about why you have so few African American scientists.  Then you start going right back and saying, "Where are they?  You know, if they're not here employed at this lab, are they coming out of graduate school with Ph.D.s?  Are they majoring in economics as undergraduates?  Are they getting their prep classes in high school?  Did they even see a microscope when they were playing with dolls and trucks?"  You know, some kids are playing with microscopes and computers while other folks are playing with dolls and trucks, and you can begin to just talk about issues of access, but access is not enough.  You also want to talk about closing gaps.  You have to have measurement, and what--I guess another thing that worries me is this whole rap about the playing field being leveled and people repeating it with impunity, and then the historical stupidity of having a president [U.S. President George W. Bush] who goes to Yale University [New Haven, Connecticut] and brags that, "You, too, can be president if you have a C average."  Why I say the historical stupidity, I can't be president with a C average, you know?  I mean I have better than a C average.  I graduated magna cum laude.  I can't be president.  Race and gender and a whole bunch of other stuff so for people to applaud that line is if the nation just wiped out a whole chunk of reality, and, you know, it--don't get me started.
Story_ID: 18613
Speaker 1: Who do you think in the African American community would you say were your role models Or--I mean you've mentioned a couple people, but what have been important in terms of the last century?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I wouldn't say role models, but I love--well W. E. B. [William Edward Burghardt] DuBois, of course, I'll always claim.  I love W. E. B. DuBois.  I wish I was alive when he, you know.  I mean I wish I could have sat at his feet just constantly, and, of course, Dr. [Phyllis A.] Wallace [Economics professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology] is someone who's not very  well-known but should be.  I think of Ida B. Wells [newspaper journalist] as a personal shero [female hero] as a crusading journalist who, you know, lifted up the veil on lynching and made sure that people knew about this crime that was being committed and recommitted and Carter G. Woodson [author, publisher and historian] who reminded us that our history is so very important.  When you look at living people, I'll tell you two women I would trade places with in a heartbeat.  I admire them so much, Maxine Waters [U.S. House of Representatives, California]  and Eleanor Holmes Norton [U.S. Delegate, District of Columbia].  Eleanor--I always tell her, "I would switch brains with you, and I think very highly of my brain," so I love her thought process, and I think she's just one of the most well-prepared legislators.  We disagree on some race matters.  I mean she's not quite as racial a person as I am, but I just admire her.  I did my senior honors thesis on her.  It was on affirmative action and seniority in 1974 when, in the middle of economic turndown, when you've just had affirmative action, do you do last hired, last fired or what do you do, and she had crafted this very brilliant solution of a racial hiring so what we had happening is that you would make lists, and then if you had to lay off ten percent, you'd lay off ten percent pretty much by race, not a perfect solution but one that was sensitive to the very recent gains that African American people had made.  Maxine is just like I think one of the boldest people in the universe.  Once I was on CNN [Cable News Network] years ago, and I got a nasty letter from a crazy white man who said, "You are as rude as Maxine Waters," and I thought that was the highest compliment.  I kept it on my wall for quite some time, but I think that she really does define that which is bold.  She is fearless.  Of course, both of those women live in the legacy of Shirley Chisholm [U.S. House of Representatives, New York] and Yvonne Brathwaite Burke [U.S. House of Representatives, California], and it's important that they're mentioned.  I think in terms of civil rights leadership, you know, I admire [Reverend] Jesse Jackson.  I really do.  He has had recent troubles, and people have attempted to tarnish him.  I think that Jesse's major challenge is that he was probably born at the wrong time.  Had he not been involved with [Operation] Breadbasket and other stuff, he probably would have sown the seeds to run for public office formally so that his presidential race would not have been his first race.  However, I think, first of all, he raised all of our aspirations with that 1984 race.  He literally raised all of our aspirations about what an African American man could do, and he has been brilliant in articulating the issues.  Now I consider him what the Bible calls a wilderness prophet whose job is really to illuminate.  I think that if, you know, the follow-through issue is one where there will always be criticism, but I'm not sure that you ask one man to do everything, and it's not clear how in a post-civil rights era you also organization-build, but I look up to him and think that he's done wonderful work, and, of course, he is a flawed individual, but God always gives us a flawed vessel in which to carry our water.  None of us are perfect.  You know, we always have clay feet, but I do admire him and Dr. Hyatt, of course.  You know, you get to go back to Dr. Hyatt and the way that she has nurtured and molded and shaped so many African American women in her very gentle way, being as much, quite frankly, a revolutionary as a Maxine Waters.  You know, just--I can't imagine Dr. Hyatt, you know, walking up to a door or something and banging on the door.  I simply cannot, with her hat and her gloves on, but I have seen her with using two words manage to have the same effect as if she had gone up and banged on the door so those are some of the people that I admire.

Speaker 1: You were talking, you know, that you aspire to one day be a college president, but I want to ask in more general terms.  You've accomplished so much in your life to date, but what do you still sort of dream and aspire to accomplish?  What roads haven't you traveled that you would like to?
Speaker 2: Hmm.  I mean I am this intellectually curious person who constantly seeks challenge so there are all kinds of things I haven't done that I'd like to do.  I'd like to have my own television program.  I'm working on that, of course, always.  I'd like to have better distribution of my work in the media, would like to be able really to use the media as a teaching tool.  I mean I, you know, see myself as doing some teaching with some of the work that I do so, you know, one of the areas that I think we don't spend enough time, and I'd love to just sort of be at the vanguard of some of this is talking about the workplace and its challenges 'cause that's where we all earn our living.  You got fifty shows on the air about the stock market going up and down, nothing that really talks about the work place, and how you prepare yourself for it, and how you make job transitions, but we're in this really interesting era, and it's something that, you know, I'd like to be at some level an important voice for.  I want to write fiction.  I've got probably three half-done novels laying around here.  One is a political novel.  One is a mystery called 'The Affirmative Action Murders,' and, you know, I'd like to spend some time and, of course, that's always my thing, but spend some time, you know, just sort of writing some fiction.  I'd like to do more writing.  I mean I write short stuff, long stuff.  I have a weird attention span so long stuff is always challenging.  I could write a thousand words in an hour.  If I've thought about a subject and pulled together the resources, I can sit down and write.  There have been columns that I have exhaled.  I have been so annoyed and just said [Malveaux makes blowing sound], and there it is.  I'd like to write more longer things that really dealt with some of these issues of economic history and some of the other things, and when I said, "I want to be a college president," I guess that's always my thing about giving back, and education is just something I value more than anything else and to be able to take and shape an institution and to provide guidance for young people.  Now I'm probably a little too crazy too be a college president right this minute, and that's why I say, "Maybe when I'm a little calmer, it might be something that I'd like to do," but I don't close any doors.  You know, I--you know, love challenge.  I mean you can get me off center by just offering me like a wild challenge.  Yeah, and I'd like to do more international travel.  I have traveled significantly.  Again I find myself extremely blessed to have been all over the place but not to Russia, not to China, not to Australia.  Those are places that I'd like to go, and I'd like to spend more time in the African continent.  I spent quite a bit of time there but more.  I'd like to do some writing about Africa.  I think we're writing Africa off in a lot of ways, and even when--[Washington] D.C., you're sitting here in the mecca.  You probably have more African immigrants here than anyplace else, you get in someone's cab, and they've got an accent, and you say, "Where are you from?"  They'll tell you Africa, which really speaks to our ignorance, not theirs.  "There are fifty-two countries in  sub-Saharan Africa so give me a break.  You're from Ghana or Nigeria or Togo or someplace.  Don't tell me you're from Africa."  I have this spiel that I give the cab drivers, and they would be like "Okay," but in any case, you know, we as people of African descent who probably would never be able to tell people exactly what country we're from ought to--but I do think I'm from Ghana--ought to be able to talk about, you know, where we have come from.

Speaker 1: Did you when you were younger in the Civil Rights Movement, you know, in the Black Power Movement, did the color issue ever come up, and the reason I ask that is that, you know, I have found--I want to ask were you too light-skinned?  Did people ever say you were too light-skinned to be a producer in the movement?
Speaker 2: No one ever quite said that, but other things were said.  Obviously color is an issue for African American people.  Now I'm from California where, of course, half of California is from the south, but because I'm from California it did not come up as bluntly as it might have come up if I had been raised in Mississippi, but, you know, you're high yellow, red boned, and these things are not compliments.  They're often said quite derisively.  You know, half white--I suppose that's why I'm not that fond of knowing about the white people who--clearly I mean as I tell people all the time, you know, you don't have black people who look like me and not have had a whole bunch of rapists on the white side.  You know, these were not love connections that people were making, but no, color is an issue for us, and it's an issue for African American women as well.  It affects our relations among each other.  I mean I've had several very painful experiences with women friends that have boiled down to "Just because you're light-skinned doesn't mean--" and then you fill in the blank.  I'm like, "Well, that's not an issue for me so it's clearly an issue for you."  Now historically you understand why it would be an issue for another woman, but at the same time it--you know, it's something that we use to divide ourselves, and we should not.

Speaker 1: Well, I was with some youngsters very recently, and one of them asked me why did I identify myself as African American, and I said, "Because I am."  She said "Yes, but there's so much da da da," you know.  What are--and I know who my Europeans are, I mean because when I was a kid, once in the third grade they had this European exercise where you had to write an essay about the country of Europe from which you came, and the teacher, who was a singularly ignorant nun, sent me home without homework so my mother [Proteone Alexandria Malveaux] wasn't feeling that.  She went back, and she said "Look, this child has French and Irish and Italian."  I'm like, "Stop with the white folks.  I'm gonna have triple the assignment," but these young sisters were really into this whole thing of owning all your heritage.  They were mulatto.  They're one parent white, one African American, and they just felt like they wanted to have this whole conversation about, you know, what else did I have in me.  I'm like my mama's black, my daddy's [Paul Warren Malveaux] black, my grandparents [Rose E. Hawkins Nelson and James Alexandria] are of African descent.  I said, "Now, you know, there's some white folks back there.  I know that, but they're not in the past two generations."  The skin color thing is something we really have to work on.  We absolutely have to work on, but it's there, and it's clearly there, and it works for you and it works against you, you know.
Story_ID: 18617
Speaker 1: And then what do you think you want your legacy to be?  Do you--you know, I ask that question.  That's our historic final question we ask, but do you--you know, you're at the age.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you're thinking.
Speaker 1: You're at the age now where that you start thinking about those things, and I'm just wondering, you know, have you given that much thought?
Speaker 2: Oh, I--you know, I--yeah, because I'm very introspective so I have--and that's how I got to the college president piece is that you want to have something that's institutional as your legacy, but I want to be known--A, I would like to replicate myself seven times, and I think I'm on about two and a half or three so we got a few more to go.  I've got one young woman who was one of my students and is finishing her doctorate, and I'm just so extraordinarily proud of her and a couple of others who are kind of in the pipeline somewhere so that is a goal.  I mean, I think it is important to look at young people and say who can I take and bring under my wing and work with, and, you know, and help and be a resource to.  That's what [Dr.] Phyllis Wallace [Professor of Economics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, Massachusetts] was to me.  She was someone who started out as an intellectual and academic mentor but at some point really became a personal mentor as well, who, you know, I could bring my problems to, who I could occasionally, not very often, but occasionally borrow money from, who I could just ask about life's path and talk about life's path with.  In terms of the body of work, I want--I'd like my body of work to be known as boldly critical of an unjust system, as always questioning, and I'd like to add to that body.  I always want to continue to add to that body of work.  I think there are some things that I've written that, you know, I would--may well be classic at some point in time, certainly aren't now, but you look back and say, "Gee, that one--I mean, you hit that one out of the park."  When you're writing weekly columns, it's, you know, at some point you're writing, and, you know that in the midst of the writing, there's sometimes every now and then you might come up with a gem or two, and you hope that those gems will have legs, that they'll be around, that people will refer to them later, and as I said, I want to be thought of as an option, as a possibility, not as a role model but as someone who might say to someone considering an academic career, "You have to do it this way."  No, you don't, or to say that you're considering a media career that has to be done this way.  No, I think that increasingly we will all invent ourselves, if you will, because we'll have jobs for less time and more jobs, and the policy space will change.  I kind of want to be thought of as an intellectual adventurer, if you will, who's kind of been on a number of paths, not necessarily just one.
