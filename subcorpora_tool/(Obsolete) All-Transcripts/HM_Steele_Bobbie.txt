Speaker 1: All right, I have five "People" magazine-type questions we ask at the beginning of each in--interview.  They just require a short answer.  The first one is what is your favorite food?

Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes, you become what you think about.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, that's scary (laughter).
Speaker 2: If you're not thinking about anything, you know what's coming (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 56151
Speaker 1: So let's, let's talk about your, your, your origins and your, your parents.  And can, can you give us your parents' names and, and spell their names for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Mary, M-A-R-Y, Laney, L-A-N-E-Y, Rodges, R-O-D-G-E-S; strange way of spelling Rodges, but that's how we spell it.  My father's name was Abraham Lincoln Rodges, A-B-R-A-H-A-M, Abraham, L-I-N-C-O-L-N, Lincoln, R-O-D-G-E-S, Rodges.
Speaker 1: Now were your parents from Mississippi, from--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Cleveland, Mississippi?
Speaker 2: They were from--my, my father originally was from Florence, Mississippi.  That's near Jackson.  And my mother originated from Greenwood, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how did they meet?  Did they have a story?
Speaker 2: They met on a farm near Skene, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that?
Speaker 2: S-K-E-N-E, Skene.  It's probably not on the map, it's so small.  But my father was an overseer of a farm, and my mother lived on a nearby farm.  So somehow or another they met.  They never really told us how, but I do know that my father was 27 and mother was 17 when they got married.
Story_ID: 56152
Speaker 1: Okay, now, does, does your family pass down any stories about slavery days or about the origins of the family or, you know?
Speaker 2: My mother [Mary Laney Rodges] was a great storyteller, and she often told us about her history and about the history of her father, who was her only parent that she knew.  Her mother died when she was 11.  My father [Abraham Lincoln Rodges]didn't have a great history.  He was given to a white landowner at age eight, so he was separated from his family.
Speaker 1: He was given to the--
Speaker 2: He was given for a debt that his father allegedly own--owed--the landowner.  And he stayed there until he was 27 years old, so I want reparation (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, by you--what, what year was your father born and when was he, was he eight?
Speaker 2: My father was born 1904 in, in Florence, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: So this is about 1912 when he's given--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, about that time.
Story_ID: 56153
Speaker 1: Was that unusual--(unclear)?
Speaker 2: I don't know if it wa--if it were unusual, but he's the only person that I know of that claims to have been given up for a debt, yeah.
Speaker 1: He was raised by the white family then as--
Speaker 2: Yes, and the family's name was--last name was Hilton.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did he talk about how he was raised?  Was he, was he treated--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he would often talk about the young girl that grew up with him.  The landowner had a girl about his age.  I believe her name was Mary Louise.  And he would often talk about how she went to school, but he couldn't go.  But she taught him everything that--she taught him what she learned at school, so that's how he learned to read and write.  And he eventually became a teacher, a local country teacher.  In those days, you could be a teacher without a high school education, so he actually taught my mother [Mary Laney Rodges].
Speaker 1: Okay, so, da--did he talk about how he came to be separated from that family that raised him?  And did they just raise him like a son or something--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, he--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --he talked a--he talked a lot about how they treated him.  And, and in his opinion he was treated fairly decent I guess, because he didn't have anything to compare it with.  And he was elevated to the position, if you will, of being an overseer of the farm, which in, in that case was a sort of a, a badge of honor, if you will, for people in--at his--you know, during his time.  And he, he didn't go to school, formal school, but he was anxious to learn, and he learned as much as he could from the girl, from his--the landowner and so forth.  So it was a pretty--he turned out to be a pretty smart man.
Story_ID: 56154
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, so he was appointed as a teacher by the--I guess, guess the local people, you know--(unclear) getting paid him to teach--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --their children.
Speaker 2: Well, you know in those days, the school was in the church.  And he taught school in a one-room church where they had grades from one through eighth, and my mother [Mary Laney Rodges] was one of his students.  So I don't know who evaluated his credentials (laughter), if you call what he had credentials.  But I would imagine it's pra--it--his capability probably grew out of his participation in church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now, so did he teach during most of the time that you, you know, you were growing up?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't continue his education as a teacher, but my mother did.
Story_ID: 56155
Speaker 1: My mother [Mary Laney Rodges] went, went on to become a teacher.  She was seventh grade when she and my father [Abraham Lincoln Rodges] married.  And she never stopped going to school.  She never--she never really gave up the thought that learning was important.  She graduated from college with my youngest brother.  And subsequent to her first graduation, she got three master degrees, and she taught school for 40 years.
Speaker 2: Now, where did she go to school?
Speaker 1: She graduated from Mississippi Valley State [University] in Itta Bena, Mississippi.  She had previously attended Tahoma Junior College during off-season.  When I say off-season, I mean during the time we were out of--we were not farming because we were farmers; we were sharecroppers; we worked land.  And when I say work it, we raised cotton.  And during the summer months, spring and summer, we had to chop the cotton.  And during the fall we'd pick cotton; we harvested it.  And when--in between the time of chopping the cotton and picking it, there's a little lapse in time.  My mother would go to school during that time.  And she'd go to night school.  And by the way, she finished high school without ever putting her foot inside of a high school.  She took a course called High School Self-Taught, and it was done via mail.  So, the book that she ordered contained all of the subject areas that were necessary to finish high school.  And as she completed various--the respective sections of the book, they would send her a test.  She would take the test and send it back, so that's how she finished high school.
Speaker 2: That's interesting.  So when she went to Mississippi Valley State, and did she have to leave the family?
Speaker 1: No, she went ex--she went evenings, weekends, extended day, and--until she finished.
Speaker 2: It was, it was close enough then for her to commute?
Speaker 1: She would drive. Valley State is at Itta Bena, Mississippi, and we lived at that time at Cleveland--she lived in Cleveland [Mississippi], so she had about a 40-minute ride every--you know, there, forty-minute ride back, so.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And she taught school before she actually finished college, because in--you know, in the State of Mississippi, you could actually teach school with a high school education in some school districts, or some counties rather.  And you had to go back to school to, to meet the requirements for your license.  You had different categories of license, C license, D license and so forth.  So she continued to go to school to meet those requirements, and in the process, she just went ahead and completed--had a burning desire.  She really, really had a burning desire to get an education, she really did.
Story_ID: 56156
Speaker 1: So, can you tell me about some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes, I can tell you about sights.  I studied the stars in the galaxy as a child, because our house had a tin top--tin roof, tin top roof.  And where they pound the nails into the roof, you could actually see the galaxy.  And so--and at night when we would sit on the porch, we would study the constellations.  My mother [Mary Laney Rodges] would teach us the Big Dipper, the Little Dipper, and I've even seen fragments of meteorites.  An astrology teacher at Chicago State he didn't told me I'd ever seen 'em, but I've seen tails of comets or meteors or whatever they were falling from the sky.  They'd light up the sky, and they would have a, a streak of light that would pass through the sky.  And my brother and I would pass down to the ground--fall down to the ground.  My brother and I would run over the fields and find those pieces of lava that had fallen.  And we've picked them up and they've been hot.  So that was--and then we'd ask our mother to explain to us what it was, and of course she would.  So, certainly, that's something that is very memorable and is a--that's a sight that I won't forget.
Story_ID: 56157
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, now, there's a difference between what the night looks like--night sky looks in a city like Chicago [Illinois] and the way it looks in, in Mississippi, out in the country.  And for those who are gonna be watching this tape later on, can you kind of explain the difference in what--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, in the, in the South, in the rural area of the South, there is no interruption of what's in the sky.  In the city you have a lot of tall buildings and a lot of smog, a lot of smoke.  But in the country you see the open sky.  You can see, you can see the constellations.  You can follow the shapes.  There is no glaring of lights, and there's no layer of smog or smoke, so you can actually--when the sky is clear, you can actually see the constellations; you can see the North Star; you can see the brightness of Polaris; you can see Cepheus; you can see the Big Dipper; you can see all of the constellations when they're out.
Story_ID: 56158
Speaker 1: Okay, what, what, what are some of the other memories of growing up in the South--other, other sounds and the sights and the smells of--
Speaker 2: Well, I was particularly interested in science when I was growing up.  And I remember catching grasshoppers, lightning bugs and trying to figure out what made the grasshopper hop, what made the lightning bug's tail light up.  I remember crickets, the sound of crickets.  I was curious about how a cricket made a sound, what made cricket make sounds.  I was interested in knowing why grasshoppers--where grasshoppers went in the winter, because you don't see 'em in the winter.  And we often would play with ants.  Ants are very, very educational animals, if you will.  The ant will build an ant hole, and all of the little ants will follow the ant right into the hole.  So, we used watch the ants build their holes and march--(unclear)--have to be very intelligent because they follow leadership.  And then we used to--I used to play a lot with some--I don't--I've, I've forgotten the name of the bugs, but we, we, we would stick a straw in the ground.  And I think it was--we call 'em "doodlebug, doodlebug round and around, doodlebug, doodlebug in the ground."  And the doodlebug is supposed to come out.  If you, if you roll the straw around long enough in the hole, the bug is supposed to hear you and come out.  I don't know if the bugs did that, but we played the game (laughter).  So, though, you know--and then I used--I remember the sound of the cows' voice, the lowing of the cow.  The cow would moo every morning.  And of course we had pigs, hogs, if you will.  And I remember the oink sound of the hogs.  Because we had chores, and every morning my oldest brother had to milk the cow.  My youngest brother had to feed the hogs, and I had to feed the chickens.  So I distinctly remember the sound of the animals.
Story_ID: 56159
Speaker 1: Okay.  What kind of food did you all eat down there, and did you--you, you, you have any memories of food or--
Speaker 2: We ate, we ate most of the food--well, most of the food that we ate we raised.  We bought such things as flour and meal.  But most of our meats were meats that we raised.  We would kill hogs.  We had bacon, ham, chitterlings, all of the parts of the hog we ate, except my mother never allowed us to eat the feet of a hog nor the ears.  My dad [Abraham Lincoln Rodges] liked the ears, but momma [Mary Laney Rodges] didn't let us eat that.  We ate beef.  We ate--we'd kill a yellon (ph.)-- that's a young cow--and we would have all kind of beef, beef steaks.  And we mostly got our sausage from the hog we would grind up.  I don't know--I don't remember the part of the hogs that we would use to make the sausage, but it was some good sausage.  I remember momma would put sage in it to give it a little kick, and they'd put a little fat in it to make it tender if it was--if it were lean.  They would also store it, store the side of the hog that we used for bacon in the smokehouse--was--kind of cure it so that we could use it all winter.  So that's what we ate in terms of meat.  We never ate wild game unless we went to visit someone.  My mother didn't cook it.  She was adamantly against it.  She said she ate enough of it--too much of it as a child, and she wasn't gonna give it to her children.  We ate a lot of vegetables.  We grew a lot of vegetables.  We grew all kinds of greens.  And I, and I distinctly remember sweet potatoes, 'cause we used to have a big field of sweet potatoes.  And my daddy would take a plow and plow--after the sweet potatoes were fully matured, he would plow the sweet potatoes, and we would go out and pick 'em up, and dust them off, and put 'em in a sack.  So we ate lots of sweet potatoes.  We ate lots of green beans, and crowder peas, and dried beans.  We ate a lot of chicken, 'cause we raised a lot of chicken.  We ate fried chicken, smothered chicken on Sunday mornings, and which was always a treat, smothered chicken and pork chops, where I mean real, a real treat on Sunday mornings for breakfast.  We ate--what else--fish, not too much, 'cause my daddy didn't--dad and our mom weren't people that fish, so we didn't eat too much fish.  We only--most of the fish that we got was either bought from someone who was traveling through the neighborhood and sold it.  But our basic meats consisted of just pork, beef, and chicken.
Story_ID: 56160
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what, what kind of a little girl were you?
Speaker 2: Feisty, smart.  I remember my mother [Mary Laney Rodges] said that I was very brilliant, and I thought it was, it was something that I should kind of flaunt.  And because she thought I was smart, she taught me to memorize a lot.  She taught me when I was about six, seven years old the name of all the states, and I could just rattle them off.  I don't think I can do it anymore.  She taught me the capital of each state.  And when her friends would come over, she would kind of show me off by having me to recite those to them.  She taught me a lot of poetry.  And of course, she had books for us to read and she read to me a lot.  I remember the first story she read--first book--I'm sorry--that she gave me was named "Alice in Wonderland."  I think I was about eight years old then.  And I enjoyed reading; I enjoyed making things; I have--I enjoyed sewing.  I made my first prom dress.  I have a little dolly at home now.  A dolly is a cloth that you would put on your dresser.  And you put crochet around it and pra--put a design in the center, and you'd use thread to make the design.  So I have a dolly now at home that I made when I was about 10 years old, so it's pretty old.
Story_ID: 56161
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so, so you--was, was it hard to, to come across books and stuff, or did you--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, no, I didn't have an abundance of books that weren't--but my mother was a reader.  My mother read everything.  She'd read true story magazines; she would read the Bible; she would read "Reader's Digest"; she would read "Life" magazine.  I have a "Life" magazine that my mother--well, several that my mother collected from the '50's [1950s] and '60's [1960s].  When she died I just kept them.  But she was an avid reader and she passed that along to us.  And there was always printed material in our home.  And she liked--she loved to work puzzles.  She had about a four-foot stack of puzzle books near her bed, and she would hold you a conversation and work a puzzle at the same time.  And of course, our house had a lot of printed material in it.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: Even when we were struggling we had books.
Story_ID: 56162
Speaker 1: Okay.  How many brothers and sisters did you have, and where do you fall in that--the--
Speaker 2: There were five of us.  I am number four.  I'm next to the youngest.
Speaker 1: And how, how many boys and how many girls?
Speaker 2: There, there were three girls and two boys.  My oldest sister passed away in 1998--'96' [1996].  My younger sister is a retired schoolteacher.  My youngest brother is a retired school teacher and a minister.  He lives in the South--he's a retired high school principal.  My oldest brother lives here in Chicago [Illinois] and he's retired.  He retired from I think it was some company, warehouse company.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So everybody in my family is retired except me.
Story_ID: 56163
Speaker 1: Okay, well, how did you like school, or how did you do in school?
Speaker 2: I did fairly well in school.  I first--in high school I caught up with both of my brothers.  In the South if you didn't make the grade you failed.  I mean it was no secret you didn't make it; you failed.  So at one time there were three of us in the same room: my oldest brother, my youngest brother, and myself.  And so I think I left my youngest brother in, in seventh grade.  And my oldest brother went to the Ar, Army so he, he kind of dropped--(unclear)--out of the scene.  But I did well in school.  I was very determined to, to do well.  I didn't--it didn't come easy.  Some things I had to really work at.  And--but I, I, I tried to do all that I could to make good grades.  And of course, in the South there were teachers who, who would give you a bad grade if you did--if you looked a certain way, and I had to endure that.  You know, I was dark skinned, didn't have long hair, and in the ca--and the community that I came up in, you know, it seemed to be a preference for people who were fair skinned, that long hair, you know, come from a certain family.  So I had to always work a little bit harder.
Speaker 1: And, and this is in a black school too?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, in a black school.  The high school that I graduated from is named--was named Cleveland Colored Consolidated High School.  And I went on to--after I graduated, I went on to Alabama A and M College [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University] in Huntsville, Alabama, and stayed there for two years.  And at which time, my youngest brother had gotten out of college.  And mother had two of us in school at the same time, and it was a bit overwhelming, so I decided to stay out and work for a year.  And during that time, I came to Chicago [Illinois] and I've been here since.
Speaker 1: Okay--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 56164
Speaker 1: How did you--when you were in high school [Cleveland Colored Consolidated High School, Cleveland, Mississippi], did you have any idea what you wanted to be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: I wasn't really--I, I, I, I really wasn't clear on what it is I wanted to be except that I had a yearning to do something in science.  So when I went to college, I took--the first two years of college I took all of my electives in science, so I took biology, zoology, physiology, anatomy.  And I really enjoyed it, but I, I knew that I wanted to do something that would allow me to give of myself.  I didn't know what it was, and so when I came to Chicago [Illinois], I lived with my brother for a short time.  I moved out and I got married, but I continued to go to school.  I went to night school for ten years.
Story_ID: 56165
Speaker 1: So, how did you--oh, before I ask this quick question, how--who were some of your teachers in, in grade school and in high school [Cleveland Colored Consolidated High School, Cleveland, Mississippi]?  Now, you, you were in a segregated school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And who were some of your, your teachers that, that made an impression on you, you know, when you were--'cause they, they were fueling this education--(unclear)--fire I guess, you know.  And--
Speaker 2: Pauline Holmes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from Mound Bayou, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Pauline was my biology teacher.  She was so wonderful.  She was energetic; she was fair; and she was resourceful, and I wanted to be just like Pauline Holmes.  Another teacher that left a lasting impression on me was Mrs. Emma Jean (ph.) Adams.  She taught me in eighth grade.  And I vividly remember how stern she was.  If she gave an assignment, she wanted it brought in.  If it wasn't brought in, you had to hold out your hand to get your lack--your spanks with a ruler.  She gave us spelling tests every Friday form the spelling list that was given out on Monday.  And if you failed the spelling test, you had to pay.  You had to pay with laps and your hand.  Mrs. Adams was, in spite of her way of punishing, she was very concerned about us getting a good education.  There was another teacher that taught me after school that I remember.  She taught typing.  Typing was not taught in high school during the time I was in high school, so my mother sent us to--sent me to take private typing lessons--Ms. Davis, and I vividly remember her.
Story_ID: 56166
Speaker 1: And there was Mr. Boone who didn't know too much, but he was a funny man (laughter).  He taught algebra in high school and geometry.
Speaker 2: And he didn't know much--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: He didn't know anything, but we had fun with Mr. Boone.  And I remember him saying the kids would get so noisy when they came into his room.  And he would say, "People, people, people, let's stop talking, people.  Let's stop talking people."  And kids wouldn't pay him any attention.  So, the long and short of it is, Mr. Boone always had to get help from other teachers to even settle the class down.  But he knew--I guess he knew enough to--for somebody to hire him, but I didn't learn anything, or very little from his class.  But I do remember him because he was so different, very eccentric.  Then there was Miniola (ph.) Thompson who taught English.  And then there was Mr. Gibson.  I can't remember his first name.  He taught, I believe--in my senior year he taught trigonometry.  And then there was Mr. Howard from Philadelphia, Mississippi.  Mr. Howard was my basketball coach, and I played basketball, played good basketball.  I was a guard.  And I remember him.  And I remember Mr. Bell, who was the superintendent of Bolivar County [Mississippi] education system at the time.  So, and then I remember, just going back awhile, my fifth grade teacher--I believe it was, was Clotee (ph.) Kissart (ph.).  And I saw him not long ago, 'cause her husband passed away and I went to the service.  So those are some of the teachers I remember from Mississippi.  Now, there are other teachers that I remember from college.
Story_ID: 56167
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of the school in Mississippi again, your high school?
Speaker 2: High school was Cleveland Colored Consolidated High School [Cleveland, Mississippi].  And the funny thing about it is that the high school and the elementary school were connected.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they were in the same building or?
Speaker 2: They were virtually in the same building.
Speaker 1: And how many students went to school there do you know or, or--
Speaker 2: I don't recall--
Speaker 1: --approximately?
Speaker 2: Well, I would say about--we had elementary one through eight, and then high school, you know, of course, freshman through senior.  So I would say about four or five hundred at least, minimum.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was a pretty good sized rural school.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Now this school was in town.  By the time I got to high school, we had moved to town.  Yeah, we had moved up a little bit.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you weren't sharecropping anymore.  You were--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, we--no, we didn't sharecrop anymore after we moved to town, yeah.
Story_ID: 56168
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what, what was your father [Abraham Lincoln Rodges] doing for a living?   What, what was he teaching or?
Speaker 2: No, my father never got, got a chance to go back to school, or he didn't choose to go back, so he went into the insurance business; he wrote insurance for a while.  And then he worked at an automobile showroom for a short time.  And I believe he, he eventually started organizing in the community, trying to organize NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  And word got around that he was organizing this group, and his--he lost his job at the car dealer.  So he left Mississippi and came to Evanston, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what year was this?
Speaker 2: That probably was 1956 or 1955 or something like that.  And he, he started working at the Arthington Hotel in Evanston [Illinois].  And then he went back--he went to school after he got here and took electronics and learned to fix television sets.  So he opened a television repair shop with a friend of his.  So he worked at Arthington Hotel and he worked at the television shop--repair shop.
Speaker 1: He sounds industrious, you know, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 56169
Speaker 1: Now, when you--how did you wind up at Alabama A and M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Huntsville, Alabama]?  Did--wa--what--did--had you planned to go there--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --or--(unclear)?
Speaker 2: I had never seen the place.  My father [Abraham Lincoln Rodges] was working for--I believe it was an electric company, and they were doing some work in Huntsville or somewhere near Huntsville.  And it was around the time that I was coming out of high school.  And he saw this college and he told me about it.  He said it's a beautiful college over there.  You ought to check it out.  And so I wrote for information, and they sent it.  And I made an app--made an application to the school and they accepted me.  So that's how I ended up there.  My father introduced me to that college.
Speaker 1: Okay, where there ever any issue of money or anything--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Of course.  I had to work.  In order to pay tuition, I had to work out part of it.  And I had this wonderful job of cleaning the bathroom.  After all--I lived in the girls' dormitory.  And every night, after all the girls were gone to bed--well, most of 'em, 'cause some of 'em stayed up all night--I had to go clean the toilets, and clean the face bowl, sweep down the bathroom.
Story_ID: 56170
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well, how did you find Alabama A and M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Huntsville, Alabama]?  Was it--was it as, as interracially segregated as high school in terms of the light skin, dark skin thing?
Speaker 2: Well, I only found that in the sororities.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At Alabama A and M the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, girls were fair skinned.  And the AKAs [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] were brown, so I opted to join AKAs.  And they were more into--I felt that they were more into service projects, doing things in the community.  So I ended up pledging AKA.
Speaker 1: That's interesting 'cause it's usually the opposite--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, I guess--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --it varies from campus--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess so.
Speaker 2: --to campus.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  So, so you, you were an AKA.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 56171
Speaker 1: And, and so how--tell, tell me about some of the other, the other activities at Al--Alabama A and M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Huntsville, Alabama].
Speaker 2: Well, I, I only stayed there two years.  And I was involved with--well, I pledged my last year.  I was there in '56' [1956].  I was also in, in the marching band.  And suffice it to say, I played trumpet.  And my mother [Mary Laney Rodges] hated 'cause I would travel with the swing band.  And on many occasions, I was the only girl.  So, in those days that was sort of like unacceptable.  But the guy that play--I played second trumpet, but the guy that played first trumpet, solo first trumpet, taught me how to play his solo, because he would get drunk.  He would drink White Lightning.  They'd put Kool-Aid in it and make it look like it was--they were drinking Kool-Aid.  And he would take me to the band room and teach me how to play a solo part, so I loved that.  I, I had great fun.  And during the football season, of course we played--we traveled with the football team, the band did--the marching band.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I was in band; I was in pledging for the sorority; and I worked.
Story_ID: 56172
Speaker 1: Okay, those are basically--now, now you mentioned there, there were some teachers in college that really inspired you with that.  Was, was--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --some of them--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Some at A and M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Huntsville, Alabama] and I--after I left A and M and came to Chicago, I went to Chicago Teacher's College [currently Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois].  Just looking back at A and M, one of the teachers that really inspired me was Dr. Chambers.  Dr. Chambers was a science teacher.  And Dr. Chambers could lecture from a book from cover to cover without looking at the book, and I just thought that was so brilliant.  And he would give us projects after we had studied let's say the digestive system.  He would give us a project, and he said--for a grade.  And it goes something like this: digest a butted ham--digest a buttered hamburger.  So, we had to tell what enzymes were in the mouth, in the stomach, in the small intestine, how it broke that hamburger down so it could be absorbed by the bloodstream--products from it could be absorbed by the bloodstream and eventually pass from the body.  So he was really cool.  He would also give us--if-- let's say if we were studying the Circulatory System, he would give us an earthworm to dissect, so we could see the band around the earthworm's body covered the earthworm's heart--hearts--earthworm has five hearts.  So, it was very creative, very gave--very innovative kinds of assignments.  And Dr. Chambers was cool.
Story_ID: 56173
Speaker 1: Another teacher that I remember from Alabama A and M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Huntsville, Alabama] was Ms. Love.  Ms. Love was a librarian.  And the boys used to often tease Ms. Love because they'd call Ms. Love ugly.  But Ms. Love was so smart.  She knew the Dewey Decimal System like--I mean it was just a natural phenomenon for her.  And if you would go in the library and ask her for books on certain topics, she would say it's in the corner over there, it's in that corner over there, you know.  She was just so knowledgeable about the library.  And then there was another teacher that taught world literature, and her name was Mrs. Thigpen.  And Mrs. Thigpen was--she was a creature of Greek literature.  I mean when it came to really learning literature, the gods, Agamemnon, the god Zeus, and all of that, Mrs. Thigpen would just make it so real, you know, till you feel as though you were right there and a part of it.  Boys used to make fun of Mrs. Thigpen when she'd come into the room, when they didn't wanna have class.  Mrs. Thigpen wore several different colors of slips.  And they would say, "Mrs. Thigpen, your slip is hanging" (laughter).  And she would say something like this: which one, the red one, the blue one, the white--or the white one?  (Laugher) So, it was--I mean she really--we, we, we really had fun in Mrs. Thigpen's class.  But she, she knew when the boys were trying to throw her off and not have class, so she would just quiet 'em down and go to toilet and pull up her slip and come right back and have class.  Those are probably the most impressive teachers that I had at A and M.  I had some very impressive teachers at Chicago Teacher's College [currently Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois] though.
Story_ID: 56174
Speaker 1: Now, that's another story.  But the--you actually--I think you said--I'm not sure if it's on tape or not, but you left Alabama [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Huntsville, Alabama] to come up here for the summer--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and ended up staying.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: This was in 1956.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And your--was your father already here?
Speaker 2: My father was in Evanston [Illinois], mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I didn't stay with my father [Abraham Lincoln Rodges] when I came here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I stayed with my brother, who lived down in Chicago [Illinois] at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so, so what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, after I didn't find a job that summer, I didn't find a job until September when it was time to go back to school.  And I got a job at Spiegel and started work.  Then I met this guy, you know.  He started telling me all this stuff that he was gon' do for me, you know, and I believed him.  And he said, okay, well, you know, let's get married, so we did.  But--and I worked at Spiegel for a short time after we got married, and then I stared going back to school.  I went to night school.
Story_ID: 56175
Speaker 1: At that time, Chicago Teacher's College [currently Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois] had a West Side campus at Crane, Crane High School, so I took most of my extended day classes out at Crane High School.  And I went to Crane High School in the extended day program for almost 10 years.  And by the time I graduated from college, I had five children.  So, and there were teachers there that really left an indelible impression on me.  One was Dr. McBride.  Dr. McBride was the principal at that time of Farragut High School.  He was a huge man, and he was almost frightening to talk--very intimidating to talk to.  So, he taught me the first class that I took--first integrated class that I ever sat in was his class, philosophy--history and philosophy of education.  And the class was made up of adults who had degrees in social work who were trying to become teachers.  They needed eighteen hours to become teachers.  At that time, there was a great demand for teachers, so they came back to get those eighteen hours.  And I was an undergrad, and most of them had degrees.  And it, it, it made me feel a little bit uneasy because they all seemed to know so much, and they were working, and, and they'd had work experience.  And here I am without a lot of work experience and new to the system, never gone to the integrated school.
Story_ID: 56176
Speaker 1: And so Dr. McBride gave an assignment.  We had to read a book of our choice on education, make an oral report to the class--a written and oral report--give him the written report, and make the oral report to the class.  And that was part of our final grade.  So I chose a book James B. Conard on secondary schools.  I don't know how or why I chose it.  It was just--maybe because it was something of a little book.  And I read the book and gave him my written report.  But when he called on me to give the oral report, I was frightened to death.  As much as I talk now you won't believe that (laughter).  But anyway, he called me up in front of the class, and I gave the oral report and I was so nervous.  And so he had me to turn my back to the class.  He said, "How many would give her an A--I don't how many hands went up--B, C, D, F."  I was so horrified I wanted to choke that man, 'cause I thought he was cruel.  I said why would he do that to me?  And I can't remember what the racial, what the racial mix was, but I know that I was among--I can remember that there weren't many blacks in the class.  And so after class--I, I did come out with a B.  (Unclear)--person that was averaging the grades for me averaged out a B for me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So after class--
Speaker 2: That day you didn't know how they voted though?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I knew that day how they voted.  I didn't know who voted.  I didn't know how they voted, but I know the average came out to be a B.  So after class that day, Dr. McBride told me to stay in the room.  And I said, oh my God, what is go--what's, what's going on now?  So I stayed in the room.  He said let me tell you one thing."  He said don't let these people intimidate you.  He was reading my body language, my behavior I guess.  He said you'll make a darn good teacher.  He said and I wanna help you.  So, from that point on, it kind of lifted the burden of fear from me.  And so I, I, I, I remember him and have great appreciation for what he did for me, even though at the time I thought it was cruel.  Maybe he could have done it another way.  But I, I, I remember him for that.
Story_ID: 56177
Speaker 1: I also remember Dr. Dimitrov (ph.).  She was like the coordinator for all of the teachers.  And Dr. Dimitrov would say to us, I want you so prepared to teach that if you go into a classroom with a brick, you'll be able to teach, just a brick.  She said you can teach weight; you can teach length; you can teach di--she said you, you could make a lesson plan from just a brick, a rock.  Because many times you'll go into a classroom--and I guess the books were short here in the system--and you're not gonna find materials to work with.  You have to create your own material.  You have to create your own curriculum.  And she--I mean she really drove that point home to the extent that we could not use commercial bulletin boards.  We had to make everything.
Story_ID: 56178
Speaker 1: And I'm just as--asking you about college.  We were talking about, you know, Chicago State Teacher's College [currently Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois].  And, and you went to night school ten years and got out, you know, showed a lot of perseverance.  Now, now what did your husband [Robert P. Steele] do for a living at that time?
Speaker 2: My husband worked at a company called Jefferson Electric, and he was an electrician there, and he worked there twenty-eight years.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you have help like with the children and stuff?
Speaker 2: You know, the one good thing about the family I married into--well, not--there are many good things, but they were so helpful in assisting with the children.  His mother would offer her help to keep the babies when I had need for her to keep them.  His sisters would help, and helped a lot.  He's a family man.  He loves his children, and they love their dad.  So, and he liked to cook, and they liked for him to cook.  So he had a big family, and they were very helpful in helping us with the children.  And then I had good friends in the church that I attended.  They helped out a lot.
Story_ID: 56179
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now while you're in college [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Huntsville, Alabama], basically, in, in Mississippi there's, you know, the voting rights struggle is going on and a lot of (unclear) where you find activities of Fannie Lou Hamer--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and you know, Bob Moses [Robert Parris Moses], SNCC [Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee] down there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you ever go back and, and talk to people about what was going on?  Or did you relatives write you and talk about all the changes going on in Mississippi in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, I was in Mississippi the year that Emmett--Emmett Till was killed.
Speaker 1: That was like '57' [1957]--'56' [1956], '57' [1957].
Speaker 2: I don't remember exactly what year it was, but--
Speaker 1: You had moved to Chicago [Illinois] at that point or?
Speaker 2: I, I don't--I can't remember if I had moved to Chicago.  I believe it was before '56' [1956].
Speaker 1: Fifty-four [1954] maybe.
Speaker 2: Maybe it was '54' [1954], 'cause I remember the big cars coming down there and the--it was lots of people, a lot of activity.  And 'cause I remember some car from Illinois pulled up into our driveway.  And of course it excited me because it was a big, pretty, shiny car, and it had an Illinois plate.  And so, then we late--later found out what had happened to Emmett Till.  And we said, well, you know, they must have been down here for that occasion.  Dr. T. R. M. Howard [Dr. Theodore Roosevelt Mason Howard] was a mover and shaker in terms of a civil rights leader at that time down in--he was a doctor at Mound Bayou in Mound, Mississippi.  And he worked very hard to make sure that we understood our voting rights.  He was often called upon to speak at large gatherings.  And then there was Amzie Moore that was the local leader in Cleveland [Mississippi] who organized NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].
Speaker 1: Now he's, he's fairly famous now, Amzie Moore.
Speaker 2: Is he?
Speaker 1: A lot has been written about Amzie Moore in relationship to the voters--voter's campaign--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in working with Bob Moses--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and SNCC--been movies made with people playing Amzie Moore.
Speaker 2: Is that right?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, ma'am (laughter)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, I knew him--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --very well.
Speaker 1: --they talk a lot about Amzie Moore.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: He was--well, he was the le--local leader, worked at the post office in our hometown, yeah.
Story_ID: 56180
Speaker 1: So--but my father [Abraham Lincoln Rodges] was one who wanted to become involved in the Civil Rights Movement for the sake of people having the right to vote, you know.  And momma [Mary Laney Rodges] was always kind of skeptical about it.  So when I was in high school [Cleveland Colored Consolidated High School, Cleveland, Mississippi], we talked about there, there was a college right across town, a Delta State Teacher's College [currently Delta State University, Cleveland, Mississippi].  And one of my friends who, who was in--was graduating with me said he wasn't going away to college.  He was gonna go over there and go that school.  And his dad told him if you go over there and try to integrate that school I'll kill you, 'cause you're just gonna cause trouble.  So he left Mississippi and came to Chicago--no, to Gary, Indiana, and I think he's still there.  But, suffice it to say, my mother integrated--helped to integrate that college.
Speaker 2: And she actually went to school there?
Speaker 1: She actually went to school there, years, years, many years later.  And she said they would put tickets on her car every day.  She said one time she had sixty parking tickets, but didn't discourage her.  She said she called the black policemen in that city and told him that she was being ticketed for coming to school over there.  And he said give 'em to me.  I'll take care of 'em.  So she said he took care of 'em.  She never heard anything from them, and they stopped putting tickets on her car.  But my mother carried a gun (laughter).
Story_ID: 56181
Speaker 1: Just talking all the activity and Civil Rights Movement going on in, in that part of the, the in Mississippi Delta.
Speaker 2: Scott Stearns: Can you find out what kind of gun that was?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, what, what kind of gun did your--what kind of gun did your mother [Mary Laney Rodges] have?
Speaker 2: I don't--I think it was a .32.  She, she was assigned--I guess what, what really got her to get the gun was, first of all, she lived alone, and I guess she got the gun to protect herself from invaders or whatever.  But when they integrated the schools they sent her to an all-white school.  And she was fearful that someone would try to do something to her--harm her, so she would take her gun to school.  And as she would ride to school she'd put it on the seat of her car.  And when she got out, of course she'd take it out and take it in the school with her and put her purse up.  But I was always fearful she was gonna have an accident and shoot herself (laughter).  But when she passed away, my brother came to the house, and he said the first thing he thought of was "where's mama's gun?" (laughter).  And he--of course, she had it in a nightstand by her bed.  It was fully loaded (laughter). 'Cause didn't want anybody to come in there and hurt themselves with the gun.
Story_ID: 56182
Speaker 1: Now those were days--these were very tense times.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Growing up in Mississippi in those days was, was tense.  I know that.  I wasn't there, but I--it was--I, I know it was tension.  How did you and the, you know, with the death of Emmett Till and all that, how did the community deal with all that tension, you know?  I mean, or did you really feel it was unusual (unclear) the tension?
Speaker 2: Well, if you live in an environment like what we lived in, you begin to know what your parameters are.  And you have a lot of anger inside, but you dare not let it go, for fear that you were gonna get re--you know, retaliated against.  So you kind of breezed through it, grieve through it, if you will.  And that's, that's what happened.  We, we knew it was wrong.  We were hurting inside, but we had to, we had to survive, you know, and so we'd talk about it among ourselves.  And my brother and I decided we were going to join the Civil Rights Movement.  And my mother [Mary Laney Rodges] was fearful that something would happen to us, so she discouraged us from joining.  So I guess that's why it's a bit of fight left in me now, because I didn't let it all out.  And, and it's been good for me, because having come from the background I came from and being a part of what I am now, I had to have some fight in me, yeah.
Story_ID: 56183
Speaker 1: Are there any similarities between some of the discrimination and experienced that Mississippi and that which is experienced here in Chicago?
Speaker 2: During that time or now?
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, yeah--
Speaker 2: During that time--
Speaker 1: --during that time--
Speaker 2: --it was blatant.
Speaker 1: --when you came up from--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Okay, because there's--what I see, Larry, the discrimination that I have experienced have been based on a period of time in which I lived.  In Mississippi discrimination was blatant.  You knew you had to go to the back door of a restaurant; you knew you had to sit on the back of the bus; you knew you couldn't drink at the same water fountain.  That's blatant.  In Chicago--versus in Chicago [Illinois], when I came in '56' [1956], you know, it was supposed to be--I thought you could go any place you wanted to go and, and, and you would not be discriminated against, but that wasn't the case.  On the job, I came to--I brought to Spiegel two years of college, but I didn't get the best job.  The lady that was my supervisor didn't finish high school, and I, and I couldn't move.  So that's another form of--now you know it's sort of subtle, but it was here.  And then in the community, when we started--I'm from the West Side of Chicago, North Lawndale.  When we moved farther west, where the Jews used to live, they moved out.  So it was saying to us, to me, that we don't wanna live with you.  And so the kind of discrimination that I experienced in the South was a little bit different than the discrimination I experienced here, but they were still discrimination.  So, and it still exists.  It still exists.
Story_ID: 56184
Speaker 1: But the thing now that exists that, that, that, that, that really blows my mind is blacks who discriminate against other blacks.  I live on the West Side, so some of my friends who live South will say: "You live on the West Side?"  Yes, I live on the west side of Chicago [Illinois].  "It's bad over there."  Well, heck, it's bad everywhere.  And if that's where I opt to live, that's my business, isn't it?  So, you know, I heard George, a friend of mine, the other night say that integration did us a disservice, black--when I say us, I mean blacks.  Because what integrati--his rationale was, what integration did was justified blacks who wanted to move out into another community to get away from around their people who were, they considered, not desirable.  It justified them moving and opened the door for them to do so.  Case in point: in the South where there were, before integration--when a child went to public school.  He went to school with policemen's son, the doctor's son, the teacher's son or daughter.  But after integration, those people left.  When open housing came, they left.  And now what you have in a--is a poor, a poor community, high crime.  And it's because the people that have been left behind don't really have the kind of leadership.  They can't put together the critical mass that's needed to really make this community viable, and not only in housing, but in businesses.  You know, we used to have the ma and pa stores, you know, and we don't have 'em anymore.  Two hundred and fifty thousand people lived over there in Robert Taylor Homes, no black businesses.  They could have supported the black business.  But the people that lived there or live in the community, if the small businesses there, they'll go downtown rather than shop locally.  So integration had a lot to do with our mindset of how we treat each other.  It did; it really influenced, had a, I, I believe, a negative influence on how we treat each other and how we look at each other, how we view each other.
Story_ID: 56185
Speaker 1: Do you have any ideas as to why black people have this kind of a cultural interracial problem with each other?
Speaker 2: Larry, I wished I knew; I, I really do.  I wished I knew what element could bring us together so that we can work together as a people.  I don't know.  I think now there is such a gulf between the haves and the have-nots, until it's just gonna be hard to close that gap.  I think education probably is the only, is the only tool that will help to bring us closer and closer together.  And I mean on both sides, not just the--for example, I looked at the paper the other day, and they said the middle-class people, middle-class people are moving back to Chicago [Illinois] while poor people are moving out, okay.  Robins, Harvey, Ford Heights, and all those communities that where there is a huge population of people, African Americans, going to had--we, we, we, we know from the last census that they moved to South Suburban Cook County [Illinois].  Those communities are not--can't, can't thrive unless they have a tax base, unless they have revenues being generated by people who come to their community.  The school systems are overwhelmed.  The infrastructure of the cities are overwhelmed.  So we gonna have to take more responsibility in caring for ourselves.  We can't wave freedom with one hand, a banner with one hand, and a public aid check with another hand unless we are doing something to, to, to get that public aid check out of your hand over a period of time.  Now I don't say that everybody will be able to do it, but there are some able-bodied people who are able to do more for themselves than they really do.  And we gotta stop blaming other folk for our miserable state, you know.  It's--or a miserable condition.  A lot of this stuff is self-inflicted.
Story_ID: 56186
Speaker 1: And you let some leaders sell you that somebody else is responsible, when in fact, we are responsible for a lot of our mishaps, a lot of--the killing for example, the killing, Larry.  When a white cop kills a black kid, there's march.  When a black boy kills another black boy, it's nothing.  It's like it's supposed to happen.  Well, both parties that died are just as dead.  So when are we gonna stop, you know, pretending that it's okay to be killed by another black, but not okay to be killed by white.  It's not okay to be killed by anybody.  Violence begets violence.  And when we have people march against us killing each other, then we're gonna have some--get some results, and really stand and really mean it, not just for the television sake, but, but, but, but really say that I'm gonna see that no guns are kept in my house for kids to get ahold to.  And I'm gonna do a, a, a check of my teenager, my teenager's room from time to time.  And I'm gonna sit down and talk to this boy about his friends and where he goes.  And I'm going to monitor his going out and his coming in.  And I'm going to monitor his education.  When we take that kind of responsibility, then we will have better communities.
Story_ID: 56187
Speaker 1: Okay, now, back to Chicago Tea--Teacher's College [currently Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois] (laughter)--(unclear).  So you--after 10 years--you, you graduate and, and you're able to, to now teach, right--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the public schools?
Speaker 2: I went into teaching.
Speaker 1: So and, and how did you find that, and like where did you teach?
Speaker 2: I went into teaching in 1969.  I started teaching at Paderewski Elementary School [Paderewski Elementary Learning Academy, Chicago, Illinois] at 22nd and Lawndale.  I taught second grade.  I worked at that school for seven years.  It was right next--right near where I lived.  I could walk home and cook dinner, walk to school with the kids.  After leaving Paderewski, I went to Matthew A. Henson [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] and I taught there, there, which is a stone throw away from my house.  I taught there seven years.  And then later I went to Washington Irving [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] in the Near West area, and I taught there ten, twelve years.  So that's where I finished my teaching career, at Washington Irving.  And during my teaching career, I taught elementary education from first through eighth grade at various times and reading.  I had a reading lab for several years.  And during the last few years that I taught, I worked with Spanish children, making the transition from Spanish to English.  So I did that on what's--in small group settings.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you were a teaching in the public school system when the, the overcrowding issue was, was hot in Chicago when the Willis Wagons were--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Shortly after.
Speaker 1: Shortly after that?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember the days, though, when they had double shifts and--
Speaker 1: Because your children were in school then.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, right.
Speaker 1: It's been a lot of issues in Chicago around education.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Story_ID: 56188
Speaker 1: And now I also read that you were involved in organizing activities, labor or--organizing and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I--you know, as I stated before, I didn't get all that energy out my, my system in Mississippi, so I brought a lot of it to Illinois.  And I began to work in the community early on when I was nineteen years old, when I af--right after I got married, I, I started working on the polls; I'd be a poll watcher.  And I didn't like what I saw.  I saw a precinct captain closed the curtain.  During that time, we had a voting machine that had a lever.  You'd pull the lever back, close the curtain, and they had these little keys in there.  You'd go down and, and, and pull down the keys of the candidate that you're voting for.  And the first election I worked I saw the precinct captain go inside the curtain with the people that were voting and just pulled the levers down for them, pull the little keys down for 'em.  I don't like that.  So he was a Democrat, and I was working as a Republican judge.  And so--although he recruited me, but I didn't like that.  And I said I gotta bet more involved in community work 'cause I think this is taking advantage of people.
Speaker 1: Yeah, just for the record, in, in Chicago the Democratic Party rules.  And if you're a Republican, they have to actually find people to pay to be Republican--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --judge--judges--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --'cause there aren't any.
Speaker 2: And I was his token.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so at the end of the day when you have to tally up the votes--how many Republicans and how many Democrats--this man would go back into the voting booth and vote some more to get his numbers up, because precinct captains were rewarded for the total number of votes they brought in.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And I said I don't believe this.  I, I mean it was absolutely mind-boggling.
Story_ID: 56189
Speaker 1: So you felt that this subverted the voting process--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It did indeed.  So I started going to community meetings.  And Bale (ph.) Whaley (ph.), who was a community leader out in the Lawndale area, invited me to the Greater Lawndale Conservation Commission to be coordinator of all the block clubs there.  And I agreed to do that, during which time, Greater Lawndale Conservation Commission was looking for an executive director.  And we brought in--they brought in Danny Davis [Congressman Danny K. Davis, HM].  I could not take this fellow with this bushy hair and this dashiki.  And he was just like--I don't know.  It was something about him I just didn't like.  And so Ms. Whaley said, well, we, we, we think he's a nice guy.  But when Danny began to talk, and I realized he was just, he was full of knowledge and, and, and totally committed.  I had another res--I had different respect for him.  So that's the way I first met Danny Davis.  And I believe the Greater Lawndale Conservation Commission did hire him, and he worked there for a short time.  Then I went on to work for the City of Chicago a short time under the War on Poverty program.  That's what we called it then.  It was created by the Economic Act of 1964.  And I worked in that program for a short time.  And so, someone needs to go out into the community and help people to learn how to connect with their resources, so I organized my block club.  And I stayed president of the block club for about 20 some odd years or more.  Then after I started teaching, I got involved with the Chicago Teacher's Union, so I was a union delegate for eight years.  So I heard all the grievances and dealt with the principal of the school.  So then after I'd really got involved with community work, I guess it was during Art Turner's [Illinois State Representative Arthur Turner, HM] election, maybe Danny Davis's or Art.  I can't remember which one--think Danny first, 'cause he ran for Alderman of the 29th Ward.  I volunteered to work in that election.  Then I volunteered to work in Earlean Collins' [Illinois State Senator Earlean Collins, HM] election when she ran for Senate, and then Art Turner's campaign, and, and David Rhodes when he was Alderman of the 24th Ward, and they threw him out--they tried to throw him out.  I worked for him.  I was always with the underdog, the voiceless, the faceless.  And the Democratic Party was my enemy at the time.  I didn't want any parts of the Democratic machine.  But--and, and that's how it pretty much evolved, you know.  And during when Harold Washington [Mayor Harold Washington] ran for mayor of the city, I ran as his endorsed candidate in the 24th Ward.
Story_ID: 56190
Speaker 1: Now, just for the record, Harold Washington [Mayor Harold Washington] was actually running against the Democratic machine.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And the, the--which had been long dominated by the Daleys--I mean Richard J. Daley [Mayor Richard J. Daley]--and some of his proteges that picked up after him late in the--the one when Harold Washington ran with Jane Byrne [Mayor Jane Byrne]--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, that was some election.  Were you here then?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was Richard M. Daley and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It became a movement.  It took on--it started out as an election, and it evolved to a movement.  And it was just--it just spiraled.  And there was so much energy in that election until people were just--I mean I had an office on the West Side, and I was a distribution center for the literature, and I was in graduate school at the time.  So I decided I was gonna help Harold get elected, but I wasn't gonna do too much for myself 'cause I just couldn't see myself working 365 days a year versus ten months out of a year.  And I had two months off to spend with my family, you know, when I was teaching.  So I worked really hard for him and organized the community for him.  And I virtually had 600 people to come to my office.  They wanted literature.  They brought money.  They brought food.  I mean it was--we were just overwhelmed.  And every day, I mean Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, every day, there was someone coming to that office wanting to do something.  I remember the last week of the campaign I had a food lady.  She coordinated the food.  We had cakes; we had pies; a big pot of chili.  I mean people would bring stuff from all over just to say they gave something to the election.  And of course there was a lot of conflict between the Democratic Party and Mayor Washington's group, so we had to settle disputes; go get folk out of jail; and you know, try to hold on to our good workers.  And of course when the election was over and Harold won, it was--I mean the jubilee in the street was just great; it was great.  I don't think I'll ever see that kind of energy in my lifetime again.  I just, I hope that I do, but I, I don't think I'll ever see it.
Story_ID: 56191
Speaker 1: That, that's a common sentiment in people--(unclear)--(unclear).  I mean I was here and I felt the same way.  So at that time, did you have any thoughts about running for office yourself after--
Speaker 2: I ran when Harold Washington [Mayor Harold Washington] ran.  I ran as Alderman of the 24th Ward.  There were four candidates in the race: three women and in--including myself, and Bill Henry.  And Bill Henry was, of course, the ward committeeman and the alderman incumbent.  And you know it was with the Democratic Party, and he won.  I came in number two.  But following that election, the Democratic Convention was convening, and I ran for delegate to the Democratic Convention, and I won that with big numbers.  And so Harold Washington had--he said he had great respect for the, the numbers that came out of that election.  And I think that kind of gave me a launching pad to go into county government.
Story_ID: 56192
Speaker 1: Yeah, Henry became sort of controversial in the Washington [Mayor Harold Washington] years I guess, or he, he may have been before.  But what's your assessment of Bill Hen--Henry?
Speaker 2: Bill Henry [Alderman William "Bill" Henry] was a very colorful person, and he would say things that would get attention.  But Bill Henry in his heart was really a good person.  I'm not saying it 'cause he's no longer here.  But when he--we were on opposite sides, you know, of the--politically.  And he tried all that he could to break my spirit to get rid of me, but he never could.  He couldn't figure it out.  He couldn't figure it out.  And after he couldn't defeat me or get rid of me and send me into oblivion, he decided to work with me.  So he would often tell me, "You know, you're crazy, but I like you.  You don't understand politics, but I like you."  And I said--I would tell him, "Bill, I believe in participatory government.  I believe that this government is of the people and by the people, and I think they should have some say in it.  I don't think we should be treated as little kids.  We should be told who to vote for.  You vote for who you wanna vote for."  Yeah, yeah, we'd have--we've had really in-depth discussions about his kind of politics and my politics.  But during his late years, when I ran for office, Bill Henry told me--and I really respect him for this--he said, "I'm with you 100 percent, and my captains are gonna carry you."  This was after my first term in office.  And if Bill Henry give--if Bill Henry gave you his word, he would keep it, right or wrong.  If he said I'm gonna try to knock you off the ballet, he did that.  I mean he gave it all that he had, and he tried to do that, and he couldn't defeat me.  So he would make statements to call attention to himself.  And he was outspoken and all that stuff and--but Bill Henry had a good heart; he really do.
Speaker 1: He was, he was machine oriented.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, without a doubt.  That's all he knew.
Speaker 1: And you were for participatory--
Speaker 2: I was progressive.
Speaker 1: --politics.
Speaker 2: I was for participatory government.
Story_ID: 56193
Speaker 1: All right, now, you said earlier that Bill Henry [Alderman William "Bill" Henry] didn't--was trying to figure out what made you tick, and so I'm gonna ask you what did make you tick then?  I mean what were the things that really were, were driving you for public office?
Speaker 2: I think what really motivated me to go into public office was to break the cycle of plantation politics.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what do you mean by, by plantation politics?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I saw, I saw people giving their votes away--giving their vote away just because somebody told 'em to do something for--or for some token, a pair of stockings, a chicken.  Jane Byrne [Mayor Jane Byrne] offered--when she found out that hams weren't going good for the people that she wanted to vote for her, she--somebody told her, look, the hams ain't sell--people not getting these hams.  They don't want no more hams.  She said go get some fish.  Well, she started (laughter) giving out fish.  And I thought that's a crazy way to run government.  That is an awful way to run government.  So I guess the driving force behind my wanting to be in public service was to free up people to make choices, intelligent choices and to bring the government to the people, instead of pe--the government suppressing the people.  Bring it to them; let them participate; educate 'em; let 'em know what opportunities are associated with different branches of government; help them to understand what county government is; help them, help them to understand what benefits they get from county government; and county give the people the benefits they deserve.  So I guess the driving force was my willingness or my passion, if you will, to help to open up government so that it was mutual respect.  People respect the government.  The government respect the people.
Story_ID: 56194
Speaker 1: So, so you're first elected to the county commission--Cook County--as Cook County Commissioner in, in 1983?
Speaker 2: Eighty-six [1986].
Speaker 1: Eighty-six [1986], okay.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: All right, okay, so you didn't, you didn't come in with Harold [Mayor Harold Washington] when he first came in office in '83' [1983], but you came in, in '86' [1986]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and well, how was that?  Was that what you expected when you got in, in, in office or was County Commissioner what you expected it to be?
Speaker 2: No, no, there was--you know, when I campaigned, I used to use the phrase that county government was the best kept secret in town, because there's no information.  There was no information out there in the library.  You know the city has a municipal library, and the county doesn't.  I couldn't find anything in the public library about county government.  So I went to the League of Women Voters, and they gave me some information, you know, sheets of paper, but nothing that was compiled.  And I just went around talking to people, trying to find out as much as I could.  And as it turned out, I said, hmm, this is interesting.  This was, this was before I decided to run 'cause I was--I asked about Cook County Democratic women if I would run.  So I called Harold [Mayor Harold Washington] and asked him if he thought it was something that I should devote my time to, and he said oh, yeah.  And I said if I, if I run, will you support me?  And he said, "Why did you have to ask me that?  You know I'll support you."  And so, anyway, I didn't wanna take it for granted.  But the long and short of getting acquainted with county government, it was--it's such a subdued--well, it was at that time--you know, the government--until it was scary.  And the job only paid $35,000 a year.  And was saying oh, they don't pay anything.  That's why nobody (unclear).  But I found out that at--in, in the old days, it was like the last stop before the graveyard if you were a politician, okay.  You could be an alderman, a state rep, or a senator.  And then you came to county government for your reward to get your last swan song in.  And on--you only came to a board meeting twice a month and you stayed there for an hour, 'cause the decisions had already been made by the time you get there.  And so it was like, you show up, roll call, answer roll call, and then you say I approve item dada-de, dada-dada, doon (ph.).  Everybody in favor, say yeah, okay, all opposed, no, and there was never, hardly ever any nays.  I think Jeanne Quinn was on the board.  She was probably the only one that I know that I recall that had opposition to the normal process of board meeting.
Story_ID: 56195
Speaker 1: But anyway, I was elected with the support of a lot of people.  My involvement in the community and with various civic groups, church groups enabled me to get forty-four endorsements my first election.  I had no money and I was teaching school at the time, had a daughter up a Syracuse University [Syracuse, New York] in school and another one coming out of high school.  So I couldn't afford to quit my job to run.  So I had to work every day.  So I worked every day and then won the election out thirty-nine candidates that ran for the ten seats for Chicago.  'Cause at that time, there were ten seats on the county board for Chicago and seven from the seven from the suburbs for the--there were thirty-nine candidates who were running for those ten seats, and I came in number five--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --over 500,000 votes.
Speaker 2: All the candidates ran at-large or?
Speaker 1: They ran for--no, there were--there're a set total of seventeen commissioners.  And before 1990, ten candidates were elected from the City of Chicago [Illinois] and seven from the suburbs.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was running for one of the ten Chicago seats.
Speaker 2: Okay, so it's to represent the West Side?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No, Chicago.
Speaker 2: Just--okay, that's how I mean at-large.
Speaker 1: Chicago at-large.
Speaker 2: At-large, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --at-large, right.  You're absolutely right.  It was at-large.
Speaker 2: Okay, so it--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --didn't matter where you lived or--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --or, or, okay.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Mm-mm.
Story_ID: 56196
Speaker 1: All right, so, so you're elected and, and did, did you think that you would shake things up a little bit--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, when I--in, in the process of gathering information about county government, I sat out--sat down and, and with my committee and we wrote up some goals, and that's what I campaigned on.  I wanted to, number one, build a new county hospital, 'cause it seemed to be that's what I was here as I went around campaigning.  I wanted--they, people wanted a new hospital.  I wanted to reopen Provident Hospital [Provident Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois].  It was closed and was a fairly new hospital that was privately owned by a foundation.  It was close.  I wanted to see more women in decision-making positions at--in county government.  I wanted to restore reproductive rights for women at Cook County Hospital.  I wanted to establish a daycare center for county employees.  I wanted to help to educate people about the services of county government.  And so those were some of the goals that I set out to accomplish.  And I, I'm very grateful today that all of those goals have been met.
Story_ID: 56197
Speaker 1: Well, one goal that I didn't mention was to open up the process of doing business with Cook County [Illinois].  There were minorities who had told me that they were not able to even get their foot in the door to bid on products.  So I wanted to open up to the products and services.  So I wanted to make sure that people who had--who were offering a service or supplies would have a level playing field in trying to do business with us.  So I wrote the purchasing ordinances.  I amended the purchasing ordinance in 1987--'88' [1988]--and that it provides that--you know, works toward a goal of twenty-five percent for minorities and five percent for women.  And the when Dick Phelan [Richard J. Phelan] came into office in 1990, we reworked that ordinance based on the "Richmond v. Croson" case.  And we established additional goals after we had done our predicate study that the Supreme Court called for us to do.
Story_ID: 56198
Speaker 1: So that goal--we, we, we, we're, we're, we're doing well, and, and one of the, I guess, crowning jewels of that ca--that ordinance is the new Cook County Hospital [John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois].  Have you seen it?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: It is wonderful, and it's being built--well, it has been built by a joint viture--venture--with an African-American contractor.
Speaker 2: Okay, and--
Speaker 1: And that's one of the accomplished goals.  Another accomplished goals--
Speaker 2: I know they own site--I mean they own edifices still there on the old site, but it--the new coun--county hospital is adjacent to it or what?  Or, or is it--
Speaker 1: No, it's not adjacent.  It's freestanding.
Speaker 2: Okay, and--
Speaker 1: See, county hospital, as we know it, was a building on Harrison Street.  But county hospital wa not--was not--a building on Harrison Street.  County hospital was fourteen buildings, the A Building, the B Building, the Children's Hospital.  And if you're in the A Building, if you wanted an x-ray, you need an x-ray, they had to take you through a tunnel, take you downstairs through a tunnel over to the main building.  And so what happened in, in the case--in this case, we just tore down all of the old buildings and put the patients into the old--into the one building, and then built the new building to accommodate all of our patients--large enough to accommodate all.  And health care is being delivered differently now, so we don't need as many in-patients there--in-patient beds.  We do a lot of same-day surgery, or out-patient surgery.  So, so that goal has been accomplished except for the opening of the hospital.  I didn't dream of renaming the hospital, but with the support and the cooperation of Reverend Jesse Jackson [HM], I introduced a resolution to rename the hospital from Cook County Hospital to John Stroger of Cook County Hospital.
Speaker 2: For the county commissioner, right?--for county commissioner, Stroger?
Speaker 1: Yes, in honor of the president of the board, John Stroger [President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, John H. Stroger, Jr. HM], right.  We've, we've opened a daycare center for 112 children.  That was one of my goals.  It's located at 69 W. Washington, have a state of the arts building and where we nurture children and from six months to five years old.  We are very proud of our daycare center, and it's for both city and county employees.  Mayor Daley [Mayor Richard M. Daley] heard about it, so he kicked in anoth--$500,000 of the Head Start money.  So the cit--we had to open it up to the city, so we're in a partnership with the city on that.  So that worked real good.
Story_ID: 56199
Speaker 1: We've reopened Provident Hospital [Provident Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois] and has the third busiest emergency room in the city.  I'll say it was last year--maybe the year before--we had 54,000 visits to our emergency room.  So that's working pretty good.  We've encouraged presidents that we've worked with to hire more women and in decision-making positions.  And I'm very proud that we have women throughout our county system that are at the top of the hierarchy in their departments.  So that's working very well.  We've tried to educate people about county government.  I think people now are more familiar with county government than they have ever been.  It's no longer a subdued unit of government.  It's a unit of government that people know about now.  They, in the old days, knew of county government only in the light of county jail and county hospital.  But now they know that we collect property tax dollars, 'cause we've gone out into the community and said to senior citizens, you're entitled to certain breaks and breaks in your taxes, and this is what they are, and you should apply for 'em.  So we've had the assessor, the board of review, to come with us to town hall meetings and fill out applications right there on site.  We reduced some of our senior citizens' taxes last year to zero.  And then there are some who get senior freeze.  So there are just many programs that can help out seniors.  There are many programs that can--on property taxes.  There are many programs that can help save property.  A lot of people have lost their homes because they didn't know what to do.  So we've held town hall meetings and tried to help educate them about how to save their home.  Your home doesn't need to go on the scavenger sale list or on the annual sale list.  Here's some things you can do.  So we've done that.  We've tried to educate people about how to take care of yourselves better.  You know, we live in a HMO [Health Maintenance Organization] society.  You know, supposed to be health maintenance organizations where you have a doctor that takes care of your--primary doctor takes care of your health records.  But many times it takes you two or three weeks to get to the specialist you need because the gatekeeper doctor has to approve where you go to get your next treatment.  And so we've tried to bring information to the community and to our constituents that will help them to live a healthy lifestyle.  I do a lot of work with asthma.  There are 17 million people in this country with asthma, and 5,000 children a year die from asthma.  It's not curable, but some of those deaths are preventable through education.  We tried to educate people about weight control, you know, taking care of yourself better, doing more exercise, eating better.  So, in addition to introducing people to the services of county government, we've tried to do other kinds of programs to help to improve the quality of life for our constituents.
Story_ID: 56200
Speaker 1: Okay.  What do you think--well, I know you still have years to go in the county at--well--
Speaker 2: I do?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, (laughter) you-a few more, at least--
Speaker 2: Oh, you sound like [Robert] Frost.  The road is lonely, dark, and deep, but I have promises to keep and miles before I sleep (laughter).
Speaker 1: What do--what is your future plans?
Speaker 2: Well, right now, Larry, I'm, I, I, I'm thinking through some things for my future.  I'm now President of the National Association of Black County Officials for this country.  And I would like to help that organization to grow because it is through county government that a lot of services are accessed, you know, human services.  And there's such a great need to help small counties in America help their constituents figure out how to access services.  I say that because there are certain issues that are faced, and particularly Black Americans--African-Americans--that we need to pay more attention to.  AIDS [acquired immune deficiency syndrome], for example, is running rampant in rural Mississippi amongst African-American women.  It's bad here, but it's bad there, AIDS STD [sexually transmitted disease].  We need to help lower the prison population.  This year more than 600,000 inmates will be released from prison with nowhere to go; family don't want 'em; they don't have jobs; they've been labeled for life.  So I'm supporting and trying to get my organization to support legislation that has been introduced into Congress by Congressman Danny K. Davis [HM] that I asked the Congress to establish a, a tax credit for those who would build homes to--for--ex-offenders, train them, and give them counseling under one roof and help to reintegrate them back into society.  So, in view of the national programs that I'm working with, I, I, I've, I think I would like to spend some time doing some work at that level for a while.  I have one more year in this term to go--also have been working with EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] on trying to do some outreach fo--for-- helping to educate people about how to improve indoor air quality to reduce the high incidence of asthma and asthma attacks.  So those, those are some of the projects that I've been involved with on a national level.  I've also--I'm also pra--chairman of the Deferred Compensation Advisory Committee for the National Association of Counties.  And as chairman of that committee, I help to oversee the investments of about $6 billion of county employees' money into the 457 Plan, tax deferred plan.  And so, and in so doing, I've been able to bring on some African American and minority, other minority, fund managers to manage those funds.  So it's education and breaking down barriers that I have focused on for the last couple of years.
Story_ID: 56201
Speaker 1: My plan for the future is somewhat uncertain now.  I really would like to groom someone to take my place.  I don't think that I have to--I should be swept out of office.  I think, you know, that I should leave honorably.  And I'm in the process of training some young people.  I have people who I've helped to go to college to come back and work for me.  And so I would like to see one of them, or some of them, go into public service.
Story_ID: 56202
Speaker 1: Now though, and though you're still young, what do you think your legacy will be?
Speaker 2: I would like, I would like to be known as someone who was fair and who tried to create a level playing field for people who were voiceless and faceless.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered for the courage that I've tried to--that I've had--always had to have.  I've grown into places and--that fools wouldn't go.  I've done things that, that the ordinary person wouldn't do.  You know, what idiot would go to school ten years at night with no money and five kids, you know?  At the end of the day--well, actually, seven now because I had a child after I graduated from college, and then my sister gave me one, so I actually raised seven children.  And by the way, I have thirteen grandkids.  So I'd like to be remembered as a person who really cared about other folk, who cared about the benefits that other people received from government that they were entitled to.
Speaker 1: Okay, is, is there anything that, that we haven't asked that you would like to say or, or?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, I, I did mention a line ago that I have thirteen grandkids.  And I would like to mention that the day that I filed petitions to run for county government, my first grandkid was born that same day.  She's now sixteen and is in advanced classes in a high school and doing well.  And most of the grandkids are doing well in school.
Story_ID: 56203
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have any, any, any regrets about going into government at all or?
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, I love what I do; I really do.  It gets to be a little challenging sometimes because people tend to think that because you're in government, you can get 'em a job, you know.  They look at you as though you're an employment agency.  Now which is something I do like about the job that I do.  I don't want people to think, you know--in the old days, you had an elected, you got stuff done.  Maybe some was illegal, but they could do it for you.  I remember one morning, for, for example, I remember one morning I was at church.  And this lady had some parking tickets.  You know, we came to the altar to say the morning prayer.  She brought her tickets to the altar and put 'em in my hand and said take care of this for me, at the altar.  I couldn't believe that.  And then there are those who are--
Speaker 1: You can expect that kind of thing (laughter) in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Only in Chicago.  And then there are people who will call my house and they'll say--I said, you know, I just got in.  I just came from an interview and I'm kind of hungry.  "Well, you can eat later.  I got to tell you about this.  My son really needs a job" (laughter)--(unclear).  So, you know, I have to be respectful and say okay, but I wish you would call me at the office tomorrow.  "Oh, but I got you on the phone now," you know, the, the, that kind of thing.  You know, that kind of thing kind of eat away at you sometimes, you know.  But other than those kind of incidents, I, I have really enjoyed being a part of, of a governmental group that, that I--where I feel I, I have tried to make a difference.  I really have enjoyed that.
Speaker 1: Well, thank you very much, Commissioner Steele.
Speaker 2: It has been my pleasure.  And maybe one day I'll get a chance to see this, okay, all right.  Thank you, Scott.
