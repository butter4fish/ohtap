Story_ID: 636092
Speaker 1: All right now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask as kind of a warm up.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And they only require a short answer.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: A favorite food? Anything with cinnamon in it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, do you, do you--
Speaker 2: I'm so sorry, French fries. Probably French fries.  They don't have any cinnamon in it, but French fries are probably my favorite.
Speaker 1: Cinnamon French fires might be--
Speaker 2: That, I may have to try that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I do, fuchsia.
Speaker 1: All right, a favorite time of the year.
Speaker 2: Spring.
Speaker 1: All right, favorite vacation destination.
Speaker 2: Cape Town, South Africa.
Speaker 1: All right, and the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  Normally I'm just screaming woo-hoo when we're doing something well (laughter).  Hopefully--that's usually that's my favorite when things are going well.
Story_ID: 636093
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Melvin Byrd] side, but separately.  And then we'll put them together.  So can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Diane Ione Diggs Byrd [Diane Diggs Byrd].  It's D-I-A-N-E, I-O-N-E, Diggs, D-I-G-G-S, Byrd, B-Y-R-D.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Data of birth is 1/14 [January 14], and I'm sorry I don't have--I, I actually should know the year, I think it's '47 [1947].
Speaker 1: Okay and where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Norfolk, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How, how far back can you trace them and what are the stories about what they were doing?
Speaker 2: You know I don't have a tremendous amount of background on, on my mother's side of the family.  I will say that my grandmother is a Meherrin Indian [Native American].  Her great-grandmother was the last of the full blooded Indians in her tribe.  In fact there's a, there's a, a stamp, a U.S. stamp I think that was actually made with my--I can't remember how many greats back, grandmother on it.
Speaker 1: Now what, what, what group is this?
Speaker 2: It's M-E-H-E-R-R-I-N, I believe that's correct spelling.
Speaker 1: Merin--
Speaker 2: Meherrin.
Speaker 1: Meherrin, Meherrin, okay.
Speaker 2: It's a tribe in North Carolina, which is where my grandmother grew up.  Ahoskie, North Carolina, specifically.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she--my grandmother was extr- was an extremely strong woman.  The tribe, at least my understanding with the tribe, is that the tribe was much more--it was run more by women than, than men.  So a very strong female presence in the tribe and she was brought up near the tribal grounds.  She grew up near the tribal grounds.  My grandfather passed when my mother was twelve.  So I never learned very much about him.  He was a bondsman, I know he was very well respected in Norfolk, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Can you give us his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Geazo Victor Dumas Diggs [Victor Diggs].  How's that for a name?
Speaker 1: Okay, okay G--
Speaker 2: I believe it's G, and I wrote it down, I wrote it down on a sheet.
Speaker 1: G-U-I-Z?
Speaker 2: No, I think it's G-E, like A-Z-O.  I'm not sure, it's Geazo.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Victor Dumas, D-U-M-A-S Diggs.
Speaker 1: And your grandmother.
Speaker 2: And my grandmother is Doris- Dorothy Diggs [Dorothy Wilson].  And then she remarried a man named Samuel Wilson [Samuel Wilson, Jr.], who was the man that I grew up with knowing as my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Geazo Dumas Diggs, that's, that's quite a name.  Is there, is there a story behind Geazo?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't know of the story behind him.  I know that he was extremely well respected in Norfolk.  He was a bondsman of course, so many people, people knew who he was.  He died very early.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay and all right so they were, so they were born in the '20s [1920s] or teens [1910s]?
Speaker 2: I think that's--so my grandmother, I'm sorry I wish I had the sheet with me cause I had all the dates written down on the sheet.  But my grandmother was probably at least fifteen years if not more, younger than my grandfather.  So he was much older than she.  She was beautiful, a beautiful woman.  She was one of twelve children and she was one of the youngest of the twelve.  And she--I remember--one of the stories that I like the most about her that is--if I can share.  When she married my--what I, who I know as my grandfather, Samuel Wilson, her children were all in their upper teens and they were getting ready to go to college.  And she--he, he was a doctor.  And he paid for all of them to go to college.  And she said that since they were not his children she wanted to make sure that she paid him back.  And so she started buying--she had apartment buildings and started buying more and more apartment buildings.  And basically had her own real estate business and paid every dime back to my grandmother--my grandfather for basically putting her children through school, which I love, I love that story.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So just honorable, she just, you know he didn't have to do it.  They were not his children and, and I just thought that was just a beautiful story.
Story_ID: 636094
Speaker 1: So your mother [Diane Diggs Byrd] was, was she raised then in Norfolk [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: She was raised in Norfolk.
Speaker 1: Okay, and does she have any stories about Norfolk she shared with you?
Speaker 2: Not many.  She went to Booker T. Washington High School [Norfolk, Virginia].  She, you know at the time my mom, my mother's mixed, although she looks more Native American than she does black.  Her hair--she had very long, straight black hair, very fair skin.  And she talks a little bit about the challenges she had in growing, growing up in the schools that she went, went to.  Namely because she looked different than everyone.  Even though she considered herself, you know, black growing up, she just looked different than everyone and all the issues that we have as a community and society around hair especially, since she had this long, straight black hair.  She said that--she tells stories of how she used to get teased about her hair all the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Cause that can be a blessing and a curse (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And a curse, exactly, exactly.  But she's very--my mother's very, a very religious person.  Has been since she was a child.  A very extremely straight laced.  I think her siblings will all say that about her.  She's one of, one of four and if you were to ask any of them, they would all say that she was extremely religious, very straight laced, and has been since she was a small child.
Story_ID: 636095
Speaker 1: So she went to Booker T. Washington High School [Norfolk, Virginia], now did she have a chance to go to college?
Speaker 2: She did, she went to Morgan State [Morgan College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] and she majored in biology.  And she was accepted--she was one of the first, one of the early, I guess the first group of minority women accepted to Johns Hopkins medical school [Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland].  And she really wanted to be a doctor.  Her stepfather [Samuel Wilson, Jr.] was a doctor.  She wanted to be a doctor.  And she--don't know exactly how this story goes, but he, he was not--did not encourage her to be a doctor at that time.  It wasn't necessarily the, the best route for a woman from his perspective.  So he was trying to coach her into being something other than a doctor.  And she decided that she was going to volunteer in the Red Cross and go into the war in Vietnam [Vietnam War], in- instead.  So she wasn't going to go to medical school, she was still going to go help and nurse and take care of people.  And so she went to--she volunteered to go to Vietnam.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did she, she, she did go to Vietnam.
Speaker 2: She went to Vietnam, yes.  My mom, both my parents--my mother and my father served.
Speaker 1: So what, what did your mother say about her Vietnam experience?
Speaker 2: She--I think she enjoy- I mean she enjoyed taking, you know taking care of people, finding activities and stuff like that for the, the, the men to do, trying to keep morale up in the camp, some of those things which is--was the responsibility of a number of the American Red Cross workers when they were there.  She tells a funny story about how when she first arrived, everyone was very talkative and they would always engage her and they wanted to know where she was form and all of these things.  And shortly after she met a number of the, the people there, everyone stopped talking to her, well they stopped engaging with her.  They were sort of standoffish.  And as the story goes, she always told us growing up that she met my father.  My father was the highest ranking black man in that area.  And he had given the directive to all of his subordinates that he--that they couldn't speak to my, my mother.  And he denied this story left and right the whole time we were growing up.  And when I was in my twenties I was--I went to a dinner with--his name is escaping me right now [HistoryMaker Dennis Hightower], but he was the president of Disney Europe [The Walt Disney Company], black. His name is escaping me right this moment.  Anyway, I sat next to him at a Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] dinner one time and I said my name and he said, "Byrd."  And he said, "You wouldn't by any chance, any chance be related to Melvin Byrd would you?"  And I said, "I, I, I am."  And he said, he said, "Well," he said, "and your mother's Diane [Diane Diggs Byrd]?"  I said, "Yeah."  He said "Oh, my goodness you're Diane's daughter.  We all loved Diane."  And he said, "Your father would not let us talk to him, to her."  And I remember, I remember going back to my hotel that- room that night and calling my dad and saying, and saying, "Mom was telling the truth the whole time.  You know she--the story was just corroborated, you did do that."  And so he was just kind of laughing, "I didn't do such a thing.  I never did such a thing."  So anyway he--I think it was--he spotted her early on.  She was a beautiful woman, a very kind woman.  And I think he said that she reminded him of his mother [Lenora Byrd].  And, and they were married in--I think they were married actually in--they met in Vietnam, I think they were married in Korea.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You were born in 1970, so--
Speaker 2: So that--this is all happening along '67 [1967], '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: So your parents were in Vietnam during the Tet Offensive?  That's one of the most horrible stretches of the war.
Speaker 2: Neither of my parents talk about Vietnam very much.  My father's deceased now, but neither of them talked, ever talked about it very much.  So--
Speaker 1: How long were they in Vietnam?
Speaker 2: My mother wasn't there very long.  Just a, a few months I believe.  My father took multiple tours and I don't exactly know how many, but I know there was more than one.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you were actually born in Norfolk [Virginia].
Speaker 2: I was born in Fort Lee [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Fort Lee, that's right, Fort Lee, right, okay.  That, that where your, where, where your mother was living when--
Speaker 2: So I was--yes that's where my parents were.  My father was stationed at Fort Lee at the time.  So we moved around in Virginia quite a bit when I was growing up.
Story_ID: 636096
Speaker 1: Let me ask about your father's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Sure, it's Melvin Leon Byrd [Melvin Byrd], B-Y-R-D, and Melvin, M-E-L-V-I-N, Leon, L-E-O-N Byrd.
Speaker 1: And his title--is he, he, was a general right?
Speaker 2: He was, he was a brigadier general.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's in the [U.S.] Army, right?
Speaker 2: In the Army, yes sir.
Speaker 1: All right.  All right now what, what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born November, November 1st, 1935.
Speaker 1: Okay and where?
Speaker 2: He was born in Suffolk, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay, Suffolk, okay.  Now what can you tell us about his side of the family?
Speaker 2: It was a very close knit family.  All from Suffolk.  They had a great deal of pride in Suffolk, Virginia.  Home of the peanut, (laughter) as they will tell you.
Speaker 1: So this is where the peanut was--or was first planted here or something (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I just don't have--they--you know it's--he also would say it's the largest county in Virginia, he was very proud of that too.  It's a very rural part of Virginia.  So I always teased him.  He had to have something to cling onto, the largest, you know the peanuts and the, and the size of the county.  But it's a, it's, it's actually a great part of the country.  A big, great part of the state.  And I still go, still go back there for family reunions.  It was a very close knit family as I mentioned.  He is one of five.  He was the oldest boy.  His father [Harry Byrd] also died around the same time he was--I think right around twelve, thirteen, he was very young.  May have been younger than that.  And his father died in an accident that happened I believe at a, at a shipyard.  And he basically at a very young age, assumed the, the primary male role in the family.  And most of his siblings, all of his siblings see him not only as a brother, but they, they saw him also as a father.  Or as their, you know sort of as their father figure.
Story_ID: 636097
Speaker 1: Now are there any stories about your father's family that survived from the 19th century? Any stories about emancipation or?
Speaker 2: So, so the name Byrd is an interesting one in Virginia.  My father [Melvin Byrd] knew much more about it than unfortunately I do.  It's something that I'd like to spend some time researching more.  But as of course the Byrds of Virginia, the white Byrds of Virginia that were all politicians, very well known politicians. All of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Senator Robert Byrd--
Speaker 2: Right, right. Virginia and West Virginia, but very prominent family name in Virginia.  And, and the story goes so we own land in Surry County [Virginia], and a sizable amount of land.  And have since the, I believe the 1800s.  And, and most of the records to my knowledge, the Byrds were always free Negroes.  So I know that there, there has to be a story there.  Plus all of my aunts are named after the white Byrds, or have the same names, I shouldn't say named after, but have the same names.  We have a Mary Byrd [ph.], and we Elizabeth [ph.]--the whole--just a number of Byrds.  But all the names are interesting because they all are prominent names from the white family.
Speaker 1: So but there's no, there's no discussion in the family about the, the history of that relationship?
Speaker 2: No actually there's not.  So there, there isn't.  It looks like the family--the farthest back that we can trace things is actually pretty far back.  I believe my father's side goes back to either the early 1700s, I think around the early 1700s.  So they've done quite a bit of research.  And it was--from what we can tell, it looks like a white woman had fell in--I think she actually fell in love with a black man and gave birth.  They went to court to try to--I think she was sued by the city, I'm not sure all of the, all of the dynamics.  But I believe her last name was Byrd.  And that--I, I'm not 100 percent confident about that in terms of her, was it her last name or his last name.  But, but I do know it was an interracial relationship very, very early on.  And that's the farthest back that we can trace things.  And there are court records of her having this mulatto baby.
Speaker 1: That's an interesting time in slavery and black and white interactions weren't exactly as people imagined them--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --imagined them to be.  Even though they--there is a lot of consistency in the, in the way people look at it, but there's an article, I think you even published it in The Root [theroot.com] about President Obama's [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] mother's family being related to John Punch--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --who was one of the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --one of the first slaves to--I mean the first Africans brought over as indentured servants in 1619.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So I mean it's a--and also Jeff- Jefferson's [President Thomas Jefferson] relatives around the mountains there--Charlotte [sic. Charlottesville, Virginia]--
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: --that were, that had white, black wives.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In--openly.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Who--that's before they--the codes were written and--
Speaker 2: Exactly.  So I, I think Virginia's history in particular is a very--when you start looking at race relationships, sorry early race relations, it's fascinating just to look at that area in Virginia.  And our family's certainly a part of that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it appears a lot of the laws are written for real situations.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: They didn't like a situation, they wrote a law to try to stop it.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: Rather than speculate about what's going to happen.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So, so that's interesting history.  You're still sorting that out.
Speaker 2: We're still sorting it out.  Yes, we've been doing--my father before he passed, was very focused on making sure that we understood the story.  And, and unfortunately passed before we got it all done, so it's something that one of us needs--all of us keep talking about picking it up and one of us needs to do it soon.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.  Someone told me once that all the Hamptons in the U.S. are related to the same Hamptons of Virginia.
Speaker 2: Interesting.
Speaker 1: You know and some--I mean I don't know if the Byrds have a similar, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I know it's probably--it's impossible to say that all of them are, but say a great deal, deal are probably from there.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 636098
Speaker 1: Right. I'd really like to know the relationship between the white Byrds of Virginia and the black ones.  I j- I thought it was interesting that my--there, there--to me there must have been some reason why my [paternal] grandmother [Lenora Byrd] named her daughters the same thing.  Even--unless she just wanted them to have good names, but that could have been one reason.  But I always wondered if there was history being handed down for a reason.  And my, my grandfather [Harry Byrd], I don't know very much about him.  Again, he died when my father [Melvin Byrd] was very young.  But he--I know that all of his siblings all had H, all their names started with Hs.  And I believe there were twelve in his family too.  So if you name an H name, there's probably one in my family.  So they were mostly--almost all boys.  So Hinton [Hinton Byrd], Harry, Har- I mean I, I can't even name them all.  There was just--if you name an H name, it's probably one of them.
Speaker 2: Now these are your father's--
Speaker 1: My father's--all of his uncles.
Speaker 2: All of his uncles.
Speaker 1: All had H names, or names that started with Hs.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So there's no reason, or there's no reason surmised as to why?
Speaker 1: No.  I suppose his parents liked the--they must have liked the sounds since they had twelve of them (laughter) with Hs.  Actually I should take that back.  There is something about sort of the naming convention that, that does exist on my father's fa- in my father's family.  So his, his uncles all started, all their names started with Hs.  In his family, all of their middle names I believe all start with L.  And then in my family, he made sure all of our names, our middle names, start with L too.
Story_ID: 636099
Speaker 1: So what did your father's parents do for a living?
Speaker 2: My grandfather [Harry Byrd] worked in the--I'm pretty sure the shipyards.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I want to do a lifeline call right now and get the answer.
Speaker 1: That's right, you said he passed away early.
Speaker 2: He passed away very early, I never knew him.  I never knew either of my grandparents on my mo- on my father's [Melvin Byrd] side.
Speaker 1: And, and what did your grandmother [Lenora Byrd] do?  Did she have to work?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't believe she worked.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I take that back.  I know she did some work.  I think she did work in the, like in the, in the--like cleaning homes and things like that.  But I don't think she--I don't, I, I don't know.  I--unfortunately I'm embarrassed to say I don't know very much about my father's side.  I never, I never knew my grandparents.
Speaker 1: Okay, you said your father tried to pick up the slack and be the man of the house (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He did, he did.  He was, he was also very well known in his community.  He was valedictorian of his class.  He--his nickname was Popcorn because he picked up a job at the local movie theater.  And he was the guy that would sell popcorn at the movie theater.  And so everyone to this day, people that know him call him Popcorn.  Or that know him from that time.
Story_ID: 636100
Speaker 1: And his story is, is somewhat interesting.  He [Byrd's father, Melvin Byrd] told it to me--he told this to me probably about four weeks before he died.  But he, as I mentioned he was the valedictorian of his school and, or his class.  And he really wanted to go outside of Suffolk [Virginia] and see what else existed.  Was very eager to, to learn about the rest of the state, the country, et cetera, 'cause he hadn't traveled very much.  And the day of his graduation, there was a family that was traveling up north to Atlantic City [New Jersey].  And he knew that that was his only way to kind of get out, that there was a, there was a--there was someone who was going up north and that if he--they had offered to let him you know, ride with them.  And, and so he did.  He didn't go to the graduation party he said.  And--which was a big deal since he was the valedictorian.  Instead he hopped in the car with this family that was going north, I mean going north for the summer.  And he arrived in Atlantic City.  He didn't have a job, he was--he had been accepted to Morgan State [Morgan College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] and he wanted to get some--basically figure a way--out a way to make some money so he could be okay in college because his family didn't--couldn't afford to pay for it; he was going to have to figure out a way to pay for it.  And so when he arrived in Atlantic City, the family that he'd gone up with arranged with a fri- arranged to have him stay with a friend for two days I believe.  But he could only stay there for two days and then he had to figure out the rest on his own, they sort of left him there.  And he wound up figuring out--finding a job and figuring out a place to stay, I think it was in someone's basement or something like that.  And while he was in Atlantic City that summer, he ran into all of these young, talented, you know, really smart young black people who were playing around on the beach or working odds and end jobs and they all went to--they were all Howard students.  And so he started playing basketball with the Howard students on his off time when he was--during the summer.  Became good friends, going to parties and clubs with all of them.  And decided that he was going to go to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] because these people were so smart, and they just had a different way of looking at the world.  And so he, he wound up at Howard.  The story goes that his, his guidance counselor did not send his transcripts and just, she just couldn't get around to finding them and sending them up, even though he was the valedictorian.  And so he had to basically talk his way into the school.  And he did.  After a number of semes- he, he would just go and camp out and was paying--joined ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] so he could pay his way.  He was not very happy about ROTC, but decided he would--that was one way that he could afford to go to school.  And you know that wound up being the path of his--in terms of his career for, for his entire life.
Speaker 2: Now he, he--I guess he was starting Howard up in 1953 I'm thinking.  He, he'd be eighteen in '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: That sounds about right. That sounds about right.
Speaker 2: So he was accepted at Morgan but he befriended the Howard players and decided--
Speaker 1: And decide, decided he was going to Howard University.  And he thought the--apparently he thought the, the women were very pretty at Howard.  (Laughter) So I think somewhere between basketball and great women and smart people, he was, he was done.  So he--and he--I think Howard was his first love.
Story_ID: 636101
Speaker 1: Okay so your father's [Melvin Byrd] at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], he's in ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].
Speaker 2: He's ROTC at Howard University.  He was working for the president, he wound up getting a, a really nice student job working for the then president.
Speaker 1: Was that Nabrit [sic. Mordecai Johnson] I think?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Yeah he was Nabrit I think.
Speaker 2: You--yeah. That sounds, that actually sounds correct.  He was very serious about his studies; wanted to do well.  But he also had a very good time while he was at Howard.  He pledged Kappa [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity]. Kappa and Howard University were definitely as I mentioned, his first loves.  He was-'til, 'til the day he passed, he, he was very passionate about Howard University and giving back.  And we've set up a, a fund in his honor at Howard.
Speaker 1: What was his major at Howard?
Speaker 2: My father was a--I want to say it was a history major.  You're catching me for sure on some of these facts.
Speaker 1: But did he have a--well let me ask this.  Did he have an aspiration, professional aspiration?  You know to pursue after Howard?  'Cause he--you said he wasn't really focused on ROTC but I thought--we know that he eventually becomes a general (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So he gets--once he gets into it, he doesn't get out of it.  But, but what did he want to be in the beginning?
Speaker 2: He never shared that.  I'm not sure.  The story--I was surprised that he--I was surprised that he got out.  He actually went into the [U.S.] military and there was a chance for him to get out.  He got out for a very short time and then decided to go right back in.  And he, he did very well, obviously, in, in the military.
Speaker 1: He would have gone back--he, he would have gone in--if he graduated in four years, he would have come out in '57 [1957].
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is the Cold War but there's no hot war going on that the United States is involved in at this point (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: So he's--it's a time of--one of the longest stretches of peace really in U.S. history.
Speaker 2: U.S. history.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) war.  So where was he--what are some of the stories about Howard maybe before we leave, you know.
Speaker 2: Trying to think of the good old--the good Howard stories.  I, I, I found after he passed and I was going through his things, I never knew my father was the, was the business director, basically the publisher of the Howard news- student newspaper.  Which of course for me when I was staring at it after he passed, was quite moving considering what I do.
Speaker 1: This is The Hilltop I guess.
Speaker 2: The Hilltop.  I think he was the business director.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I take that back.  You asked what his major was.  His--he did major in business.  I can't re- I don't recall exactly what facet, but he was majoring in business.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he talk about--there are a lot of interesting people there when he was at Howard.  Did he have a--
Speaker 2: You know I don't remember exactly who was there, but he would rattle them off.  Whenever--I, I think it wound up, wound up being something in our household.  We'd all just nod, "Yes Dad."  'Cause he would--he was so proud of Howard and all of its graduates.  And if there was--if anything was on the news that it was a Howard graduate, we all had to come in the room.  And if there was ever anything in, you know, Jet magazine with a Howard graduate, which was probably every single Jet magazine, we all had to come in the room and he had to point out Howard.  I think his greatest disappointment was that none of his children went to Howard.  So he said, "You know you have--." He told me when I was, when I was looking at colleges, "You have two choices: West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York] or Howard."  So (laughter) didn't really--I didn't go to either, but he was very focused on making sure someone went to Howard.

Speaker 1: So well when he [Byrd's father, Melvin Byrd], he, he--in '57 [1957], he, he's, he goes into the [U.S.] Army full time as a second lieutenant I guess right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Where was he--was he stationed here or overseas?
Speaker 2: He, he had a number of different stations.  I don't--his early career I'm not as, I'm not as familiar with in terms of where he was stationed.  But he--I know he traveled quite a bit.  He was in the Middle East for a while, I know that.  Of course was in Vietnam multiple times in the '60s [1960s].  He was back by the end of the '60s [1960s], so I think a couple of tours, certainly a couple of tours in the '60s [1960s].  And besides that, I don't know.  I don't know the early days.  I remember--I've seen pictures, but a number of them from the Middle East.
Speaker 1: Okay well that, that kind of catches us up to Vietnam in 1967, '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Your father's there.  What, what, what was his rank at that juncture?  Do you have any idea?  A captain or major or something?
Speaker 2: He's probably, right around then he's probably a, he's probably a, a cap- he's a captain or a major, I'm not sure which one, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right. That's when he meets your mother [Diane Diggs Byrd], and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 636103
Speaker 1: Is there a story that they tell about how they met?  I mean you know I know you, you kind of gave a version from your mother's [Diane Diggs Byrd] side.  But what--
Speaker 2: I don't know exactly how they met.  I think it was certainly one of these activities that the Red Cross [American Red Cross] was doing in the area.  My mom was definitely--she's definitely this just bright light of, you know she walks in the door and everybody sort of see--you can see her and she has just a wonderful spirit about her.  So it's not surprising to me that my dad [Melvin Byrd] spotted her.  But I don't know much more than that and I don't think she really remembered much.  But he started writing her immediately.  So she still has the first notes that he wrote to her and apparently told her he was going to marry her I think on the--after their first date.  So she said, "No, no you're not, I'm not getting married."  And so that didn't last very long.  She had changed her mind pretty quickly.  But he proposed after they saw 'The Sound of Music,' which they were playing on the base.  And I don't know when 'The Sound of Music' came out, but it may have been right--that may have actually been when it--it may have, I don't know.  Did it come out in the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 1: Yeah it did, it came out in the '60s [1960s].  The movie was out I think in '64 [1964] or '65 [1965] I believe.  I know it was playing.  I, I saw it while I was in high school.  I'd have been about fifteen or sixteen.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So in '65 [1965], '66 [1966]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --it was out and by the time it got overseas in Vietnam it was maybe '68 [1968], '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: That sounds about right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So they were--they went to go see 'The Sound of Music' and he proposed right after.
Story_ID: 636104
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions, how they walk, talk--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --how they look, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: You know it's interesting.  I do think I have a pretty good blend of both of them.  I am probably more like my father [Melvin Byrd] though.  Maybe more because of my interest than my heart, if that makes sense.  Like my, my--I probably have my mother's [Diane Diggs Byrd] heart and my father's businesslike approach to things.  But they're both, they're very--both very, very different people, extremely different personalities.  What is the same between them?  They have the same values, they have the same morals.  Like in terms of just how they were rooted and grounded and what was important in life and what was right and what was wrong and living a life of integrity and all of those things, and living a life of service.  That's what was common between the two of them.  Music, totally different.  You know what they did to have fun, totally different.  I mean just everything, completely different.  But when you looked, when you sort of, sort of boiled down to it, they were fundamentally--they were both wired the same way.  They were both leaders in their schools.  My father was valedictorian.  I mean he only had a small class, so I always teased him.  I was like, "Of course you were student council president and valedictorian, you didn't have any students there" (laughter). So my mother too was very involved.  She also was--was she student council president?  She may have been too.  I mean--or, or she was at least--she was very involved in student, in student affairs in her schools.  And she was also involved in the Civil Rights Movement.  She's twelve years younger than my father and so the way they saw the world was also very different.  The way they experienced race in this country was very different.  My father was in the, you know the back of a bus, my mom's fighting to get, you know--and, and, and, and my mother sort of fighting for the change--the wave that was fighting for the change.  And so the way they, the way they, they viewed this country and how they saw things was actually quite different.  But it was nice growing up in a family where you knew exactly the line between right and wrong, and you knew exactly how you were supposed to behave, and both of them were completely aligned in that regard.
Story_ID: 636105
Speaker 1: Do you have any--have siblings?
Speaker 2: I do.  I'm the oldest of four.  So my mother [Diane Diggs Byrd] had three girls back to back. Each--I was born in 1970, we have another one born in '71 [1971], another one born in '72 [1972].  And then my brother was born in '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Can you name them and tell us a little bit about what they're doing?
Speaker 2: Sure.  My sister is Melanie Latesha Byrd [Melanie Byrd Chisholm].  She is a hearing officer here in Washington, D.C.  She was--went to James Madison University [Harrisonburg, Virginia] undergrad and went to University of North Carolina law school [University of North Carolina School of Law, Chapel Hill, North Carolina].  She also worked for Teach for America for a number of years and became very passionate about advocating for special needs children, and is now a hearing officer here in Washington, D.C.  And she oversees cases that deal and may--most of them deal with children that have special needs.  My other sister is Rosslyn Byrd Singleton.  She went to University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia] undergrad and did her master's [degree] at the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] in counseling.  And she was one of the assistant producers on 'Dora the Explorer' for years, and then--which is a children's program.  And now is working in Birmingham, Alabama as a--for Chick-fil-A [Chick-fil-A, Inc.] marketing.  Her husband [Marcus Singleton] is a, a minister and that's where they're stationed.  And then my brother is Melvin Byrd, and we g- he goes by Bobby.  And actually that's the other name my father [Melvin Byrd] went by too.  None of--it doesn't make any sense why their names are Melvin and they both go by Bobby.  It doesn't make any sense at all.  But we call him Bobby just as my, my father's siblings called him Bobby.  Anyway, my--and my brother went to West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York] undergrad, did a master's at University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], and then he did another master's at, at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And he now works for Microsoft [Microsoft Corporation] in cyber security.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's interesting you know that one of the colleagues of James Brown was a Bobby Boyd--Byrd.
Speaker 2: Oh really? Yeah.
Speaker 1: He used to call "Byrd, Byrd"--
Speaker 2: Byrd (laughter).
Speaker 1: --like that. So, interesting.
Story_ID: 636106
Speaker 1: Now you grew up in--now you're a military child (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm a military brat through and through.
Speaker 1: You--so does that mean you grew up in a variety of places?
Speaker 2: I did.  I grew up--I was in Fort Bragg, sorry, Fort Lee [Virginia] of course, Quantico, Virginia, Alexandria, Virginia.  And that's where--I call Alexandria home namely because we were there for I think just about eight years of my childhood.  And so that's the longest place I ever lived.  My father [Melvin Byrd] did multiple tours without us.  Namely because he wanted to give us some level of stability and didn't want to keep moving--taking us out of schools.  So in fifth grade we started moving again.  And I was ten at the time.  And, and we went to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and then moved to Warren- came back to Virginia, Warrenton, Virginia.  My dad was doing stints at the Pentagon [Washington, D.C.] and then a stint in Warrenton, Virginia at a place called Vint Hill Farms Station, which is a military base.  And, and then I went to--that was middle school and one year of high school.  And then I went to Heidelberg, Germany.  And finished school in--my--I'm sorry, finished high school in Heidelberg, Germany.
Story_ID: 636107
Speaker 1: Now we always ask this question.  Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I think my--I have--I remember rolling down this hill in, in Quantico, Virginia the day that--I think we were moving.  I think the kids could go outside and play.  I was very, very young.  And then my next memory after that is taking--my mother [Diane Diggs Byrd] would always make our moves fun for us, even when we were small children.  So the movers would always have stickers on the boxes and of course they each had a number and then you can look at your list and made sure that everything came through.  And so my mother would put us in charge of taking the stickers off the boxes.  So I remember as a very small child, I was probably two or three, in one of our moves having boxes everywhere and just running around the house pulling off stickers.  So that was just one of our moves.  I mean most of my child- we moved, we were moving quite a bit, so I have quite a few memories of different houses and, and things related to moving.
Story_ID: 636108
Speaker 1: Now I know you lived in a variety of places, but were they, were they mostly on military reservations or, or--
Speaker 2: Did both.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Both, both on base and, and off base.
Speaker 1: Okay, well what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: You know so for the first few years when I was living in Alexandria [Virginia], I remember just a, a great neighborhood.  A very warm neighborhood where the--where we were one of two black families in the neighborhood.  But my neighbors were very--most of the neighbors were very kind to us, and this is the early '70s [1970s].  Were very kind to us.  And we lived next door to a three star general.  A retired, I believe he was three or four star general.  And he was next door.  And his family was always very, very kind to, to us.  And there was a Jewish family across the street who--I called the woman--to this day I call her one of my grandmothers, very, very close to her growing up.  So I felt this very--sense of community very early on.  And the house--there was always my mom, my mother was a teacher.  She was amazing, amazing teacher and loved teaching small children, so we were in heaven growing up.  Everything was about learning in our household.  And in the summers everyone wanted to come, all the neighbors, everyone wanted to come to our house.  First of all there were four kids in the house.  So we were kind of the place where everyone wanted to come 'cause there was always someone around your age when you came over.  But it was also because my mother was so creative in terms of what she did with kids and so she was also extremely organized.  I guess when you have four children and your husband's [Melvin Byrd] gone on tours quite a bit and you have to figure out how to keep the house roll- household running.  And, and we had activities every hour in the summer.  So in the morning we got up and you had reading activities.  In the afternoon you had sewing, we had cooking.  We had drama.  When we got older my--I was a gymnast, all of us were gymnasts.  So they rented the equipment from the school during the summers since no one was using it.  And we also had--then we would do gymnastics in the afternoons.  And they were--she was very serious about making sure that we got a broad exposure.  But she didn't--we didn't go outside of the house for it.  She just did it all in the house.  And in retrospect, I'm sure that some of that had to do with the fact that we were little black kids in a very white community and she was probably protecting us some.  And the other was--they also were not very wealthy and you know when you have all those kids, you need to figure out what to, you know, how to get them all exposed, exposed to things.  She just did it herself.
Speaker 1: Now the other neighborhood kids, kids would participate?
Speaker 2: Everybody came over.  We--the household would be full.  My mother would have all these activities going and people would participate.  My cousins would come sometimes for the summers and everybody knows, you know Aunt Diane [Diane Diggs Byrd], Mrs. Byrd, she was, she was the general of the house.  No, no question about it.  And she ran the house--she ran us like we were all very much on time and everything was very, I'll just say everything was very organized, very prescriptive.
Story_ID: 636109
Speaker 1: Now was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Huge part of my growing up for sure.  My mother [Diane Diggs Byrd] as I mentioned, my mother was very religious.  And so I grew up and my siblings, we all grew up going to church. On (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What denomination?
Speaker 2: So Baptist and then when you're on military bases, there are only two, there were only two options at the time.  You were either Protestant or Catholic, so we were Protestant.  And we went to church on Sundays and Wednesdays all the time.  And then--and my mother was a Sunday school teacher.  My mother is still a Sunday school teacher.  She's taught Sunday school for over forty years.  And she--and so we grew up going to church at least twice a week, sometimes more.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So these churches change--every time you moved you were at another church (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We were at another church.
Speaker 1: Different church.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  I have very--lots of memories about churches growing up and different churches.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't start in--it was interesting though when I--I don't know if you want to jump this far ahead.  But I wanted to be baptized when I was twelve and I wanted to be baptized.  I already had a sense of family and understanding like understanding tradition and, and family.  And even though we moved around in different communities and I never went to--we didn't go to black churches because on bases there were no black churches.  I asked to be baptized in my mother's church in Norfolk, Virginia, which was a black church.  And they obliged.  They were like okay, you can go back there.  Even though I'd never attended the church before.
Speaker 1: What, what was the name of your mother's church in Norfolk?
Speaker 2: Shiloh Baptist Church.  And that's where I was baptized.  And I just--I wanted to be baptized in some place that had a link to my family since I knew--I, I was very well aware at twelve that my growing up experience was different than most people's because we moved around so much.  So I wanted to have something that, that connected me to, to family and to a location.
Story_ID: 636110
Speaker 1: Was there a lot of reading material in your home growing up?
Speaker 2: Very much. Very much so.  We read all the time. I loved reading.  If you'd have asked me my favorite activity as a kid, I would have said two things.  I would have said gymnastics and reading.  So any, any opportunity I had, I was curled up with a book.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Actually fun to see my nephews now that they're, there's one like that, just like that.  I smile every time I watch him.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a better com- combination than reading and eating, say or--
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: You know yeah, so you had a, you had a balance going on.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: Reading and gymnastics.  So what was your favorite reading material?
Speaker 2: I used to love mysteries when I was a kid.  I loved mysteries and science fiction.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any specific books?
Speaker 2: That's funny, I actually don't remember many of them now.  I would consume books like, I mean I would always try to figure out how many books I could get through in a week.  On the weekends I was always curled up with a book.  Yeah I was, and I was a little bit of a tomboy.  I didn't--I was never, I never liked girly things at all.  Most people that know me today can't believe that because I'm very, I'm very much like a--well very female, very womanly now.  But when I was a, when I was a child I was--I didn't want to wear a dress.  You had--my mother [Diane Diggs Byrd] would--I mean I'd go kicking and screaming every Sunday because I had to wear a dress to church and I--every Sunday I would throw a fit.  And then she would take us--because the museums were free in Washington, D.C.  We went to church in Alexandria [Virginia], but the museums were free in Washington, D.C.  Every single Sunday for years right after church, she would bundle us all up, get us back in the car and we would drive to--we would go to McDonald's first and we would all have a hamburger and French fries.  And then she--and we would eat it in the car as she drove into Washington, D.C. to take us to X museum.  But we went to a museum every single Sunday.
Speaker 1: Lots of them--did you have a favorite museum?
Speaker 2: I used to like--I mean when I was a child I just remember the--what is it--the one with the, the big dinosaurs.
Speaker 1: Is it the museum of natural history [National Museum of Natural History, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Natural history.  That's exactly right.  When I was a child, I loved that one.  And I also liked air, the air and space museum [National Air and Space Museum, Washington, D.C.].  So I was a big fan of, of, of--I just thought it was fascinating.  But I think my favorite was definitely natural history.
Story_ID: 636111
Speaker 1: You grew up in a time when black history was celebrated in the museums and there would be exhibits from time to time at the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.] and--
Speaker 2: Right, right.  My mother [Diane Diggs Byrd] would take us.  I mean if there was a museum, yes, she, she introduced us to--definitely introduced us to, to black history in that way.  My father [Melvin Byrd] was more--my mother was very much of the ilk that you needed to--she wanted to, to make sure that we got exposed to as many things as possible and as many types of people as possible.  And she really kept race out of the conversation.  Where my father would inject it all the time.  And I have very vivid memories of issues surrounding race when I was a child, and just sort of coming into my identity as a young black girl and how my mother used to handle things and I sort of smile when I look back on things now.  But I, I remember, I remember the day that I realized that I was different and that I was--I had to go home and ask what is, what does it mean to be black.  And I was six, I was in, I was on the playground at my, my elementary school [James K. Polk Elementary School, Alexandria, Virginia].  And there were, there was a, a group of us that used to hang around and we did everything together.  And one of the little boys in the group was a guy named Philip [ph.], and he had blond hair and blue eyes.  And we were just the tightest, we were the buddies, did everything together.  And Philip had a birthday party and I was not invited to the birthday party.  And the next Monday after the birthday party--the birthday party, the day of the birthday party I remember crying at home and my mother said, "Oh, I heard that there's so many people over there and they just didn't have enough chairs.  And, and just think that someone is--you gave up your, you don't--you gave up your chair and so now everybody is comfortable.  And don't worry about it, you're going to--," you know.  She was just trying to make me--she was trying to figure out some way to handle this, which she probably knew exactly what was going on.  And on Monday I was on the playground and the kids were all talking and they said, "Donna [HistoryMaker Donna Byrd] why, why aren't you--why weren't you at the party?"  And I said, "I wasn't invited."  And this other little girl, she said, "Of course she wasn't invited, she's black and Philip's family's Mormon and they don't like black people."  And I remember going home and staring at the mirror and realizing--like looking at myself and for the first time realizing that I didn't look like all the kids that I went to school with.  And--
Speaker 1: Were, were there other black children in, in school with you?
Speaker 2: I remember two.  A young black boy and another girl.  That's all I remember.  But I didn't--I never--I didn't, I didn't--I just didn't process it like that as a, as a young child.
Speaker 1: About how old were you?
Speaker 2: This is six.
Speaker 1: Six years old, okay, yeah.  This is about the age when people try to think about that.  But now it had to be confusing for you too 'cause you don't, you don't look typically black necessarily.
Speaker 2: I was, I was--
Speaker 1: They see you, they would not necessarily know--you know a lot of people unless they knew who you were, they wouldn't know where to put you.
Speaker 2: Right.  Well I, I definitely wasn't white.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  That's true.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so right, right, right.  So and my hair might be a little straighter now than it was back in the day, so (laughter)--anyway the--yeah I remember I ju- I remember that like it was yesterday.  I can still remember, I can still remember the playground like it was yesterday.
Story_ID: 636112
Speaker 1: Okay, so six years old and you, you were at--what was the name of your school at this point? At six (unclear).
Speaker 2: I believe I was at James K. Polk Elementary School [Alexandria, Virginia].
Speaker 1: James K. Polk, now that's the famous Indian [Native American] fighting president.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: [President] James Knox Polk.  And, and this is in--
Speaker 2: Alexandria, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Alexandria, okay.  All right so now did, did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: Math.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well that's interesting 'cause you, you're more of a writer than math right now.
Speaker 2: Now actually I'm--and so even now I don't write, I, I'm on the business side of the, of the publication [theroot.com].  I was a math--I think a budding businessperson from a very young age.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So and so you were reading, we know that and you were in gymnastics and so, so you're starting school--this is 1976.
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-six [1976].  Busing started in '72 [1972], so there were--most of the other black kids that were in our schools, they were just starting to do all the busing.  And there was--it was an interesting period of time because the parents, the parents really didn't know how to help their children navigate through schools during this period of time because many of them had not--they had not grown up in integrated environments.  And so when we were--
Speaker 1: This was black and white, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is black and white.  But growing up in these, you know, our parents didn't know what to tell us to do in some situations because they had never had some of the same experiences.  But I had, I had a--I mean I had a great childhood.  And one that was, that was complicated with respect to race at a very young age, and how would I--I mean as primarily the only black child in most of my classes.  There might be one or two.  And I, I think just growing into my i- like a strong black identity took a little while because I was a little confused growing up.  Namely 'cause my mother [Donna Diggs Byrd] was--I mean in a very good, was--embraced all cultures and embraced so many different things.  And so that there, there are so many positives associated with that.  But for my own identity, I was trying to figure out where do I belong, how do I fit.
Story_ID: 636113
Speaker 1: Were there any special teachers or mentors in school at this stage, in elementary school [James K. Polk Elementary School, Alexandria, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: I remember my teachers.  Actually my gymnastic coaches in elementary school were very dear.  My sisters [Melanie Byrd Chisholm and Rosslyn Byrd Singleton] and I were, were pretty good gymnasts.  And these were white teachers, but they were very supportive of us.  And were just great coaches, wonderful coaches.  And I remember them in terms of people that were--that helped mold and shape me, I remember them the most; at least in elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now gym- what events in gymnastics were you involved in?
Speaker 2: So I did all events, but my favorites were the floor and beam.
Speaker 1: I would imagine being good at gymnastics must, must give you a lot of confidence.
Speaker 2: It definitely did.  It's a, it's an interesting sport because it's both an individual sport and a team sport in that you get judged, you know you're, you're judged on your individual performance, but you're also competing against your teammates in many cases.  So you're competing against your teammates and then you have to figure out a way that every--and then your teams of course are competing against other teams.  So it's a very interesting dynamic in terms of how you work together and also how you, you know how you excel on an individual level too.
Story_ID: 636114
Speaker 1: So did you go to middle school after Polk [James K. Polk Elementary School, Alexandria, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: So I went to James K. Polk, and then I went to Patrick Henry middle school [Patrick Henry Elementary School, Alexandria, Virginia] for--I don't remember of it's a full year or--it must have been a full year.  My parents [Diane Diggs Byrd and Melvin Byrd] were focused on making sure that we would always finish a school year before they would move us.  So I, so I finished a school year there.  And then we moved down to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, which I loved.  That was my first experience as a, as a, an older child if you will, on a military base.  And if you're familiar with Fort Bragg, it is, it is a city.  I think we had eight elementary schools on base, just to give you perspective in terms of how big it was, six, six or eight.  It's a huge, huge base.  And the rules were that we behaved when we were outside.  And as long as we were home by the time the canons went off at 5:15, everything was good.  So we had--the kids, when we used to walk to school.  We used to walk to the school in cadence.  So we'd all walk to school together and sing (singing), "Left, left, left, right."  We all walked in the same step, all going to school through the woods and stuff.  And then we'd have--we'd make up our own songs just like our parents, our parents did.  We had funny, funny cadences that people would start singing.
Speaker 1: What are some of the words?
Speaker 2: I, you know I don't even remember them.  I just remember that they were hilarious.  Now most of the boys would make up ones that were just completely hilarious, comical.  Some of them I wouldn't repeat, I'd just laugh. (Laughter) And so we had a--that was probably one of the best times growing up just because we had complete freedom.  You had to be--you had to get clearance in order to be on the post.  So there was a great sense of security.  So we could run all over and do whatever--wherever we wanted to, you know, wherever we wanted to go on our bikes or explore whatever we wanted to do in the woods, it didn't matter as long as when--the entire base could hear when the canons went off at 5:15.  So that you had no excuse, you had to be home.  I think it was--we had to be home within five minutes of the canon.  So you couldn't be too far from home.

Speaker 1: Now in middle school, now did you have a job or anything in middle school, or?
Speaker 2: So I started, I started babysitting actually when I was nine.  So that's before--that's even before I went to Fort Bragg [North Carolina].  My first job was a baby, as a babysitter.  All the neighbors knew that I knew how to take care of kids, namely because my brother [Melvin Byrd] is six years younger than I and my father [Melvin Byrd] went to Korea for a year two weeks after my brother was born.  So my mother [Diane Diggs Byrd] had a six year old, a five year old, a four year old and a two week old, and by herself.  And so I very quickly learned how to feed my brother, burp my brother, change my brother.  I pretty much could do just about everything with him.  Certainly by seven, eight years old I was doing--I could take care of him completely.  And, and so by the time I was nine when one of the neighbors in the community wanted, needed a babysitter for their children, I, I started babysitting.  And then it was the first time I ever got paid for taking care of kids.  And so I, I very quickly just started--I did more and more babysitting and by the time I was twelve I had a couple thousand dollars in the bank already.  Most of my--I did a lot of babysitting.  Every weekend pretty much.  Of course our family was the--our place was the place to call, namely because we had three girls [Byrd and her sisters, Melanie Byrd Chisholm and Rosslyn Byrd Singleton].  So by the time we're teenagers, everyone's--you know twelve, thirteen years old, everyone's calling the Byrd house because there's you know, there's a chance they might get one of the three of us to babysit.  And then we all had girlfriends and stuff, so ours was--our house was usually the first phone call that people made.
Speaker 1: Okay, so saving money.  You know are--so were you, were you, were you thinking business (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, I, I was, I was very independent I think as a child.  My, my father--you know, military people don't make a lot of money.  But my father, my father was--had believed that--he didn't believe in spoiling if you will, spoiling children.  He believed that if you, if you didn't give them that much, many things, they'd figure out how to make it themselves, or they'd figure out how to get it themselves.  And, and so that's how he was with us.  And my mother was just extremely creative.  And so if we didn't have something, she just made it.  If it was a dress, we made it.  If it was, you know whatever it was, we made it.  If it was something in school that we needed, we just made it.  And so I think somewhere between a deal, a great deal of independence trying to figure out kind of how do I make my so I have--so I can have, you know can get the things that I need to get, and my mother's creativity.  I think if you put those two things together, I just naturally fell into being an entrepreneur, actually.
Story_ID: 636116
Speaker 1: All right so after middle school, now, where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: So I went to--we moved from there [Fort Bragg, North Carolina] to Warrenton, Virginia.  I went to Warrenton Junior High School [Warrenton Middle School, Warrenton, Virginia].  And then from Warrenton I went to Heidelberg High School [Heidelberg American High School, Heidelberg, Germany].
Speaker 1: That's in Germany, right?
Speaker 2: So I went to Warrenton Junior High School, Fauquier High School [Warrenton, Virginia] for one year which is Fauq- Warrenton is in Fauquier County [Virginia].  And all the students used to have a great time with that name.
Speaker 1: Fauquier, how do you spell Fauq- ?
Speaker 2: F- I was also a cheerleader, so I know this well.  F-A-U-Q-U-I-E-R (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And, and from Fauquier, I went there--so now you're laughing, so yeah believe me, a whole bunch of--
Speaker 1: Just thinking of it.
Speaker 2: --fourteen, fifteen year old kids would have a ball with that.
Speaker 1: Other people would--
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.  So it was great in sports with the opposing teams, believe me.  So I went from Fauquier High School to Heidelberg.
Story_ID: 636117
Speaker 1: This is the first time your family was stationed out of the country with, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --your father [Melvin Byrd] was used to having assignments out of the country (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Your whole family is in Heidelberg [Germany].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there something special going on in the [U.S.] Army that they brought your father to Heidelberg (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know I don't recall there being something special, but I do--one of my, one of my favorite memories--as I mentioned to you, my mom [Diane Diggs Byrd] was just this incredibly creative woman.  An amazing military wife.  If you know about that, the [U.S.] military you know, you don't get as far as general, as general without having a very strong wife that's very active in the community.  It's tough to do I should say without that.  And my mom would make each of these moves like a journey for us.  She would make it as--like something that was exciting for us.  So my tenth grade year in high school [Fauquier High School, Warrenton, Virginia], I was on the cheerleading squad, I was in student government, I was doing all sorts of stuff at school.  And I came home one day and you know walked in the door and walked around the house, and there were all these cutout pages of magazines and there're castles and the Louvre [Musee du Louvre, Paris, France], and the Eiffel Tower [Paris, France] and all of these things.  And we all--all my, my sisters [Melanie Byrd Chisholm and Rosslyn Byrd Singleton] and I were all staring at each other like, "Mom, what's going," you know "what's going on?"  And she said, "Girls run around the house.  We're getting--we're going to move again and you get to see where you're going."  So we were running around the house and she had cut out stuff from Germany and France and Spain.  And had basically turned it into an exciting adventure for us.  So if you can imagine moving, you know with thirteen, fourteen, and fifteen year old girls from their schools, you know of course we weren't going to accept that.  We weren't going to be too happy about it.  But she made it, she made it fun.  And she made each, each move an adventure for us.  We were always--It was always about looking forward and who we had, the excitement of meeting new friends and learning new things, and she would always say, "Any of your friends that want to visit, they're always welcome."  So it wasn't like leaving--she never saw it as leaving things behind.  They could always come with, come visit, et cetera.  But we were going to something new.
Story_ID: 636118
Speaker 1: So this is nineteen sixty--I mean '84 [1984]?
Speaker 2: So now nineteen eighty--we moved to Germany ni- beginning of 19--I'm sorry, 1986.
Speaker 1: Eighty-six [1986].
Speaker 2: So I was getting ready to go into eleventh grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were going to school on base, right?
Speaker 2: I went to school on base.  In fact they just changed--they just closed our school a couple of months ago.
Speaker 1: And it was called--
Speaker 2: Heidelberg High School [Heidelberg American High School, Heidelberg, Germany].
Speaker 1: Okay. (Pause) Okay, all right so well describe--how, how many students were there and what was the racial composition?
Speaker 2: So it, it was, it was extremely diverse.  And my class was 220 something, so it was a large school.  Very, a very, very close knit school.  I still keep in very close contact with my high school class.  More so than many of my friends that are here in the United States.  So we're very, very clo- I guess we were all living in a different country together.  So there's, there's a, there's a bond in that regard.  But we're all very close.  So we had everything, it very much like a normal school in the states.  There was--to me there was very little difference between going to school in Fauquier High School [Warrenton, Virginia] in terms of the activities and going to school in Heidelberg, Germany.  It was better to go to school in Heidelberg, Germany because our field trips were, you know I took French.  So our field trips were to Paris [France].  We'd leave early in the morning, spend the day in Paris and come back that night.
Speaker 1: So you could do that.  It was that close (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So you know we--on the weekends we would go to Amsterdam [the Netherlands] or to you know somewhere in Spain.  We just, we just traveled a lot.  It was a great way to grow up and again the world was very different.  Things were just, things were much safer then.  And we didn't fear the things that we far in today's world.  So my parents [Diane Diggs Byrd and Melvin Byrd] even--they would let us travel with our friends.  As long as there was someone older.  But I remember going, going to Paris for New Year's 1987 with my cousin, just the two of us.  So I was seventeen, she was nineteen.
Speaker 1: So you went to Paris for New Year's, okay.  You had a party to go to or anything or just?
Speaker 2: No.  We got a hotel--yeah, but it was just a, it was just, just a different time and we, and we were so--in Europe people were very accustomed.  Especially young people, very accustomed to just traveling to different countries and hopping on the train and going places.  So it was very commonplace, it was commonplace there.  Here it was a little, you know it would have been a little bit different.  But I got exposed to so many things when I was there.  To me I had--I just, I had a great childhood in that regard.  I loved Europe.
Story_ID: 636119
Speaker 1: I loved being black in Europe too because the Germans at the time, most of my German friends were studying like the Civil Rights Movement and they'd studied all of these things related to African Americans in the United States.  And so when they met me, they would say, "Oh," you know, "you must be terribly oppressed there."  And they'd have all these--like they'd read all these things.  "It must be terrible."  And they were always very interested in my story.  So all my friends would be sitting around and they're all looking at me and I'm--, "Oh yes." And I'd start telling these stories of growing up. I don't know what I was talking about.  But just had a great--I used to have--I, I just had fun being the different one in the group.  Whereas in the states it was something that I was self-conscious about I think at certain points.  In Europe it was something that, that was celebrated.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now did you meet any of the Afro Germans?
Speaker 1: Not many, not many.  I knew more white Germans.
Speaker 2: Okay, German, Germany has a lot of people.  I mean it's a dense population.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So but not too many--
Speaker 1: Not too many.  We did most of the, the Germans that I met were at different events that I would go to, different school events.  So I was involved in Model United Nations, anything that was--I think I represented the U.S. on something or another, some type of global leadership conference.  I mean did a lot of that kind of stuff.  And most of the kids that were there were, were white.  So that was my--that was most of my interaction with, except for just going, you know just going out and shopping and interacting with people.  But I had--my, my school [Heidelberg American High School, Heidelberg, Germany] was quite diverse.  We had a lot of black, black students in my school.
Story_ID: 636120
Speaker 1: --just thinking now in--over here in those days Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] was still the president, or is towards the--right.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: This is--we're getting like close to the end of the Berlin Wall, Berlin Wall coming down.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: That, now did that come down while--
Speaker 2: No.  So I actually, I had the opportunity to see the East Berlin [Germany] when it was East Berlin.  My father [Melvin Byrd] had a special pass and, and clearance for us to go over and see East Berlin.  And I remember it vividly.  The thing I remember about is that it was so gray.  And there was no color in the whole place.  I just remember looking--it just looked so depressing because there was no color.  And when I went back after the wall came down, so the wall came down in '89 [1989]?  Is that right?
Speaker 1: I think so.  It was during I think the first year of George--
Speaker 2: Bush?
Speaker 1: --Herbert Walker Bush [President George Herbert Walker Bush].
Speaker 2: Right, right.  I think it may have been '89 [1989].  When the wall came down, I think a few years later I went back and I had a chance to see the--it was shortly after the wall went down.  I went back and I remember on the buildings the, the apartment buildings, people had put colored paint around their windows.  So just to provide some level of color.  So these gray buildings with like a splash of yellow paint around the window, or green paint.  And it was just, I mean it was not attractive.  But it--you could just see that people were just trying to add color to their environment.  And now, I don't know if you've spent any time in Berlin [Germany], but I, I'd move there tomorrow; it's a beautiful city.  It's a brand new, of course brand new city.
Speaker 1: The east side.
Speaker 2: The east side is, the east side is stunning, absolutely stunning.  Beautiful, beautiful city.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I had a chance to see both east and west.
Story_ID: 636121
Speaker 1: Now did you--I don't know if this is relevant at all, but I know the, the--there's a big, there's a, a group of two guys, two black Germans had a group called Milli Vanilli that was--
Speaker 2: I remember that.
Speaker 1: --videos around the time you were in high school [Heidelberg American High School, Heidelberg, Germany].
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: You remember, do you remember that?
Speaker 2: I do remember them.  I won't sing them for you, but I remember them (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter). They had a big hit song.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: They were, they were subsequently discovered to have lip synced (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Lip sync, that's exactly right.  Yeah, no I definitely remember them.
Speaker 1: I think one of them died last year [sic.] or something.
Speaker 2: I think that's correct, I think that's right.
Speaker 1: But I just wonder if they were, you know--
Speaker 2: You know what's interesting about being in, in Europe during that time is that rap music and hip hop music was really taking off here in the states.  And so I actually have a gap in the early years of hip hop because it wasn't over in Europe yet.  So I, I was introduced like 'Planet Rock' and all that stuff was, was on the radio before I left.  But there's a gap of about a year, you know a, a two year gap where a lot of the music came out and if I didn't--I, I, I was in college [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia].  When I got to college, they were playing music, I was like I've never heard any of this.  So I had a lot of catching up to do in terms of just hip hop and during that period of time.
Story_ID: 636122
Speaker 1: Now were there any significant teachers or mentors you know, in high school [Heidelberg American High School] there in Heidelberg [Germany]?
Speaker 2: I mean the most influential and sort of important teacher in my life actually was in Warrenton, Virginia, Warrenton, Virginia, in middle school [Warrenton Junior High School; Warrenton Middle School, Warrenton, Virginia].  Her name is Mrs. Tomlinson [Carol Tomlinson].  And I used to--I was very, very shy.  I was extremely involved in school, but I didn't like to talk very much.  And I--and when people would talk to me, I often stuttered a little bit.  And so Mrs. Tomlinson was the advanced placement English teacher.  And she always, she would always put on a play every year.  And she let me try out for different roles and I found out very early on that when I was on stage, I didn't stutter.  And I enjoyed having a script and acting.  It went back to what my mother [Diane Diggs Byrd] used to do with us in the summers, we had quite a bit of acting that went on at the house anyway.  And I enjoyed it.  And so she started enter me--enter, entering me into oratorical contests.  And so I started doing the American Legion oratorical contests when I was in eighth grade.  And I would, I would be in first place just about every single time.  I don't say this, this is not bragging; I'm just saying just about every single time on the prepared speech.  And the prepared speech had to be on something--it had to be related to the [U.S.] Constitution.  And it was an eight to ten minute prepared speech, no notes, no podium.  And so you had the entire stage and you had to basically give a speech.  And then there was a three to five minute segment on the articles and the--they would give you the--one of the articles five minutes before you spoke.  And you had to come out and you had to be prepared to speak on, on one of them.  Whichever one they had told you.  And I would always do this.  I remember my speech, I remember parts of my speech.  I was talking--I remember I had Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] quotes in it and I was talking about the fabric of the u- I mean this country and how we were all woven and held together by the same thread.  And this whole thing going on.  And then I'd get to the extemporaneous piece and every single time I would freeze up.  And I just, I would always--I would just--I would sort of stutter my way through the, the, the second half of the piece, the second half of the competition.  So I'd go from first place to third place or second place or whatever.  But I was able to pile up enough money over the years--I did it all the way through high school, all the way through twelfth grade in Germany since they had American Legions over there too.  And pocketed enough money to really help with my--definitely my first year of college [at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But Mrs. Tomlinson was the one behind all of that and encouraging me to sort of break out of my shell.
Story_ID: 636123
Speaker 1: Did you receive any special honors at graduation from--
Speaker 2: From high school [Heidelberg American High School, Heidelberg, Germany]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't remember special, any special honors.  I was, I was always involved in student council.  I started, I started getting involved in--like running for office and all of those things when I was probably in middle school [Warrenton Junior High School; Warrenton Middle School, Warrenton, Virginia], but not probably, definitely in middle school.  And I held, I held offices.  I was the captain of the cheerleading team when I was in eleventh grade.  I ran for treasurer, I ran for treasurer of my junior class two weeks after I moved to Heidelberg [Germany] I ran for office.  I used to find that running for office was the best way to meet people quickly and get involved.  So I just would show up to any school that I went to and just--I would run for office.  And so I ran for treasurer.  And I remember, you just mentioned music.  There was a song out, I don't remember who sang it, but there was a song out, I think the lyrics were "I've got the looks, you've got the brains [sic.].  Let's make lots of money."  So I was running for treasurer, so I changed it around.  I said "I've got the brains, you've got the looks.  Let's make lots of money."  And the whole cafeteria of people started cheering and yelling and I was the treasurer of the junior class (laughter).  And so, and so I used to, I used to enjoy doing stuff like that.
Story_ID: 636124
Speaker 1: Did you graduate [from Heidelberg American High School, Heidelberg, Germany] in '88 [1988]?  Is that, that right?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1988.  And what kind of counseling did you get about college?
Speaker 2: We had good counselors.  I, you know I was a Virginia--I felt like I was a Virginia girl.  And was very interested in Virginia schools.  My father [Melvin Byrd] was trying to push me to go to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] or West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York].  I wrote West Point and told them that I--they--I was pretty far along in the process.  And it looked quite positive, and I wrote them and told them that I wasn't interested.  And I didn't want to go.  And I remember telling my mother [Diane Diggs Byrd] or something like I've had a--all of I think--this is--now mind you, this is coming from a seventeen year old girl.  So I think my mother was just rolling her eyes.  But I was like, "Mom, I've had all of these experiences in life and I've traveled all over the world and why am I going to go to a school where they are going to make me lead the way they want to, and make me forget all the things that I've learned, and build me into the leader."  I was like, "I am already doing all of these things," and whatever.  I'm sure she was like, whatever.  And, (laughter) and so I said, "I can't even wear my own clothes, I have to wear a blue polyester outfit."  And so anyway of course I loved West Point, but I was not trying to go.  And so I applied to William and Mary [College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia] and the University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia].  And I don't remember what other schools I applied to, but the story about how I wound up at the University of Virginia is actually an interesting one.  I don't know if it's one you're--that you'd like to hear.
Story_ID: 636125
Speaker 1: All right.  This is how you get to the University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia].
Speaker 2: So I was in H- living in Heidelberg, Germany.  Decided I'm not going to, to West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York], which may have been a poor decision on my part, I'm not sure.  And it happened to be the week before I needed to let the schools know, turn in my acceptance.  And so I was going to go to William and Mary [College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia].  I thought William and Mary was a smaller school, very focused on academics, thought it was going to be a good place for me.  And, and UVA was a little bit more of a party school and it seemed like everyone had an aura about them that, I don't know I just, I just didn't--I was not as interested in UVA.  Anyway it happened to be spring break in the United States.  And the neighbor across the street from me had her son home.  And her son's girlfriend came with him, and she went to William and Mary.  And then across the other side of the street, the gentleman's daughter was home from nursing school at the University of Virginia.  Now how this winds up happening when I'm living in Germany the week before I have to give my acceptance, is kind of interesting.  So I leave, I was like I don't really want to go talk to the University of Virginia person, I want to go to talk to the William and Mary.  So I am bouncing across the street and I go knocking on the door and, and the woman--the young lady, she's a student at William and Mary, comes to the door and I had said hi to the families and stuff.  And she says to me, she goes, "Oh, you've been accepted?"  And I said, "Yes."  And this was a young white student.  She said, "Well most of the students at the univer- at, at William and Mary are very smart."  And I said, "Yes."  And she said, "It's a very rigorous academic environment, and some people just don't do very well."  And I felt this lump coming up in my throat while I was sitting there talking to her.  And she was so condescending and so--just pretty awful.  And so I remember saying, "Thank you very much."  I was very polite and said goodbye to the rest of the family, I knew the family well.  And I walked out of the door with my head bowed down just kind of going across the street.  And I knocked on the door to--her name was Jenny Asinapure [ph.].  I remember it like it was yesterday.  I knocked on the door.  Her father opens the door and yells, "Jenny, Donna's [HistoryMaker Donna Byrd] here to see you."  She jumps down the banister, rolls down the banister and she said, "I'm gonna sell you on my school, come on in."  And three hours later we had bonded.  She had told me all of these things about UVA and I went home.  My mom [Diane Diggs Byrd] was like, "Okay, we're going to William and Mary?"  I was like "(Makes sound) No, I'm going to UVA."  And that's how I wound up at UVA.  From, yeah, all the way in Germany.
Story_ID: 636126
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So was your family still living in Germany when you (unclear)--
Speaker 2: No we, we all moved back to the states the same--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at the same time.  They moved to Fort Monmouth, New Jersey and I moved to Charlottesville [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay, the University of Virginia at Charlottesville, founded by [President] Thomas Jefferson.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: So here we go.  So how, how did you like it?  Was, was it as exciting as, as your friend made it seem?
Speaker 2: So my friend sold me on student leadership.  And this, and this unique community where the students really ran everything and you could start anything that you wanted to and a very entrepreneurial environment, in addition to being a great academic school.  But when I got there, I didn't like it.  My very first year, year at UVA I was--I really, really missed Europe.  And I was, you know I was on the hall with people who--some of them had never been to Washington, D.C.  And I wanted to talk about you know, I wanted to talk about all of the things that I had been exposed to in a good way.  I just loved the world and I wanted to talk about traveling and I wanted to talk about all of these different things and I, and I couldn't find that group of people to do that with my very first year.  And it took me a little while to find that.  And so I would call--I remember calling my mom [Diane Diggs Byrd] and saying, "Mom, I want to go to a different school.  Where else can I go?  And can I go back to Germany?  Can I go to school at a university in Europe?"  And my father [Melvin Byrd] said, "Absolutely not."  So I knew I was going to be there at UVA.  And I really--I'm, I'm so glad I stayed.  I wound up loving it and being extremely--and I've been involved for twenty some odd years now with the, with the university.  But that first year was tough.  It was very difficult for me to adjust back to the United States, and especially the southern, southern mentality of the U.S.  All of a sudden race, you know, where race again, I had been cele- I was having a good time in Europe and then I came back and I go, yeah, I forgot.  This is how it goes.
Speaker 1: What was there--did you find any solace in the black student organizations?
Speaker 2: Very much so--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) yeah, very much so.  But it was just, it was just a different--just a very different feeling.
Story_ID: 636127
Speaker 1: I was very, as I mentioned, very involved at UVA [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia].  My very first year I was in--there's the--UVA has a very strong Honor System.  And your very first year at UVA you have these honor education courses where someone from the honor committee will come into your dorm and they talk about issues around integrity and ethics and all of these things.  And I was sitting my very first year, I can remember exactly where I was sitting in the dorm room.  I'm sorry, in the dorm social area.  And the honor educator was there and we're talking about all these issues.  And then we started talking about the issue of race.  And this young white student, male student stood up and he said, "Well of course black people cheat."  He said, "Their score--they don't have high enough scores to get in here anyway.  They're--they, they have quotas and that's the only reason why they're here, and so for the only reason they--the only way they can make it out of here is to cheat."  And he actually said that.  And I remember like the whole--like everyone turning in and looking at me.  They were like looking at my group, there were a few blacks, we all sort of sat together.  They all like looked at us.  And I remember this sick feeling coming over me and thinking where am I?  Like what, what you know, oh my goodness this is going to be bad.  And, and I wound up getting involved in the Honor System that year because of that young man.  There were very few black students involved in the internal part of the Honor System.  There were lots of students that were protesting against it because the system, I don't know if you're familiar with UVA, but it had a single sanction system.  Meaning if you were ever found lying, cheating or stealing, and they were serious about all three of those, and it was a se- and they judged it, deemed it as a serious offense.  You're asked to leave the university permanently.  So you are--so--and there were disproportionate number of black students that were asked to leave the university.  So black students of course were not in favor of the Honor System, it's quite understandable.  So there were--we were marching, people, you know all sorts of resolutions and all sorts of things that were going on at the university.  The black student union [Black Student Alliance] was always doing something to, to address this issue.  And I decided instead of protesting that I was going to get involved in the internal.  I was like wait a minute, well who in the world is inside of, inside understanding what's going on and how these students are being asked to leave in a disproportionate number--way.  And so I wound up getting, running for the representative for my first year, first year class.  And that was my first year involved with the univers- I mean with the Honor System.  And I wound up, I wound up being involved for the, the remaining parts of my four years.  So I wound up ultimately chairing the Honor System at UVA.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  Were you able to make a difference as the chair?
Speaker 1: You know we, we commissioned a study while I was on the honor committee, where we, we actually hired an outside group to come into the university, a group of researchers, and look at the disproportionate--look at what was going on and determine whether or not it was something that was inherently biased in the system, in the processes, or if it was something that was in the community.  And basically after this study occurred, we were able to release the findings while I was there.  And basically what they found was that people--and it was pretty basic--people were less likely to turn in people that--others that looked like them.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, so it's not that the, it's not the cheating rates or the lying rates or whatever were necessarily disproportionate.  It was just that if someone caught you or saw you and you were minority or you were an athlete, there was a higher likelihood of them turning in you than if they were to see someone that looked like themselves.
Speaker 2: You mean minority and an athlete.
Speaker 1: Minorities and athletes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was actually happening in both, both instances.  So then we spent quite a bit of my fourth year, since the study came out beginning my fourth year, quite a bit of my fourth year really talking about issues of race around UVA.
Speaker 2: So white people were less likely to turn in other white people caught cheat- cheating and let them go (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's correct.
Speaker 2: And--but they were, they were eager to turn in black people.
Speaker 1: I don't know if, I don't--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) expectation that the black people were cheating.
Speaker 1: Yes, I don't know, I don't know if I would use the word eager.  But I would say more likely to.
Speaker 2: Okay, as the young man said he--his expectation was that black people would--
Speaker 1: Yes, right.
Speaker 2: --would cheat and steal.
Speaker 1: And there were people like that.
Story_ID: 636128
Speaker 1: So I started a thing [at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia] called Nights of the Roundtable [ph.], and Nights with an N. Nights of the Roundtable.  And I would call together--it was a, it was a gr- basically I wanted to engage people around the issues of ethics, integrity and, and race.  And we did these sessions I think once or twice a month with ran- random group of students would be selected each month.  And I would host these nights at the roundtable and have these discussions with students.
Speaker 2: These are roundtable discussions with students about--
Speaker 1: About the issues of race and integrity and honor and all those things and how, and how you can operate in a community and, and how you--basically how you operate in a community, live in a community with people with diverse backgrounds, diverse religions, diverse cultural norms, and, and still find sort of common ground when it came down to issues of integrity and honor.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  Now do you think it did some good in terms of the, how people--
Speaker 1: I'd like to think so.  I don't, I don't know for sure.  I know we had--I mean I know we talked about it and, and I think the environment in which we--the environment that we created to have these discussions were, were ones where people felt very comfortable discussing these issues.
Story_ID: 636129
Speaker 1: Now what was your major?  Was it business?
Speaker 2: I was American government, actually.
Speaker 1: American government, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right now within that major, well anywhere else on campus, who were, were there any special teachers or mentors at the University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: I had a number of, of people that were associated with the students, like student leadership that I was very close to.  There's a gentleman named Ernie Ern [Ernest H. Ern], he was the dean of students at the time.  And I reported in to him when I was the president of the college and the chairman of the honor committee.  And he was extremely--just supportive, very nurturing, very strategic, very helpful to me as I navigated through politics of, of my own position as well as politics of race.  He was white, but very, very helpful.  There's a woman named Pat, Pat Lampkin [Patricia M. Lampkin] who was, who was--now the dean of students.  But she oversaw the residence life.  She was also very instrumental in those years.  I, I'm trying to think who else.  I mean I had Larry Sabato [Larry J. Sabato] was my professor in the government department.  I spent a lot of time over in the African American studies department too.  But I was really involved in student--I mean took, I took my coursework very seriously, but I was also extremely involved in student, student government as a young, young person on campus, or on grounds, sorry, on grounds.  The language at UVA, that's--you would, you always had to call it grounds.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Anyway, the--and so most of the people that I got to know outside of the class that really helped to nurture me and helped to, to coach me into, to being sort of who I am in many, many regards, were all people that had to do with development outside of the classroom with the students.
Story_ID: 636130
Speaker 1: Now, did you get a chance to study abroad, or?
Speaker 2: So I didn't study abroad in undergraduate.  I think my parents [Diane Diggs Byrd and Melvin Byrd] were very focused on making sure I stayed in Charlottesville, Virginia because if I got out again, I might not come back.  But I, I studied in, I studied abroad in graduate school.  I went to University of Cape Town [Cape Town, South Africa].
Speaker 1: Well let's get you graduated first here.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: So you're majoring in American government.  And you're, you're there from '88 [1988] until--
Speaker 2: Ninety-two [1992].
Speaker 1: Ninety-two [1992].  Okay this is, okay.  So the Gulf War starts up I think while you're in school. All right. Now did--was your father [Melvin Byrd] still in the [U.S.] military at this point?
Speaker 2: My father retired, retired while I was, when I was in college.  Right around that time.  Right around the time it was getting started, he retired from Fort Monmouth [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay so let me see what else? Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] was elected president.
Speaker 2: Right.  The Berlin, the Berlin Wall came down.
Speaker 1: Right, that's right.
Speaker 2: The--was Nelson Mandela freed right around then?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Nelson Mandela was freed while I was--I remember all of us toyi-toyi-ing in the, in the dorms.
Speaker 1: Toyi-toyi, the dance?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were all doing toyi-toyi.  It was quite a bit going on during that whole period in terms of the rest of the world, there's no doubt about it.  Fascinat- fascinating time.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any special lectures on campus by any national figures or, or--
Speaker 2: Everyone used to come through the university.  I mean it's such a beautiful setting.  It's such--I mean it's just a beautiful setting and, and of course Larry Sabato [Larry J. Sabato] was already extremely popular at that point.  And so he invited a number of different politicians and pe- they would come to the university.  There were debates that happened at UVA [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia].  There were all sorts of things that were going on.  We had exposure to a number of ambassadors.  I mean everyone used to just come through the university just to see it.  So we--there were always people on, on grounds of, of importance that we were introduced to.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Nobody you think really, really made a big impression on you?
Speaker 2: Trying to think.  Remember, I mean, so Jesse [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson], one of Jesse's sons, Jesse Jackson's sons [Yusef Jackson] was at UVA, and he came a couple of times.  I just remember hearing him speak.  Katie Couric was our graduation speaker.  I remember her.  I remember the one line she said in graduation she said she didn't know anyone on their, on their deathbed who had ever said they wished they'd worked more.  And that, that's always stuck with me.
Story_ID: 636131
Speaker 1: Immediately after graduation, did you go to grad school [Fuqua School of Business, Durham, North Carolina] or did you--?
Speaker 2: No, to--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --my father [Melvin Byrd] was not very happy about that one.
Speaker 1: Now were you--was there anything special about graduation?  Did you achieve any special honors or anything, or--
Speaker 2: So, so I, I did.  I, I received the Gray Carrington award, which is probably one of the honors that I'm most proud of.  The award--you have to be nominated for the award.  And it's named after a gentleman named Pete Gray [Arthur P. "Pete" Gray IV] and one named Ed Carrington [Edward C. Carrington, Jr.], both who passed.  One who passed I believe in Vietnam, the other one also passed very young.  And their friends--these gentlemen, one was the president of the college and the honor committee chair and they were very involved at UVA [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia] too.  And their friends got together and started a scholarship in their honor that pays for the fourth year of someone's schooling.  And every year all of the friends would come--it's something, I mean a group of like twenty men would come together and they would interview the students that had been nominated, and they would select the, the student that reminded them the most of their friend--their friends.  And so I got that award.  That was probably--that was probably the coolest award.  That was--and then I was--I also got the distinguished student award.
Story_ID: 636132
Speaker 1: Now is this when you, when you joined Procter and Gamble for a minute?
Speaker 2: So I went, I went from undergrad [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia] and I went, and my father [Melvin Byrd] wanted me to go to law school.  I told him I did not want to go to law--I did not want to be a lawyer.  He had a belief that anyone that wasn't going--if we wanted to get a graduate degree and you'd not already planned to be a doctor, then everyone else went to law school because they wanted to get a graduate degree and there was nothing you can--it was respectable I suppose with our, with families.  And I just didn't want to be a lawyer.  I wanted to be a businesswoman, an entrepreneur.  So he said, "If you want to learn, if you want to be a businesswoman, if you really want to do this, you need to learn how to sell.  So go find the company that has the best sales program and go learn how to sell."  And so I went to Procter and Gamble and I sold toilet paper and Tide soap and all sorts of detergents and paper, those were my primary areas.
Speaker 1: So, so did you relocate to Cincinnati [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: No, I came back up into this area.  So I did the Mid-Atlantic region up into the--I was based in Alexandria [Virginia].  And I, I wanted to come, I wanted to come--be in an area that felt like home again.  And I learned how to sell.  And back--basically grocery stores.  The, the back rooms of grocery stores where you're fighting for display area and all this stuff.  I learned how to get displays and convince people to do different deals in stores and all of this stuff, but that's how I learned how to sell.
Speaker 1: How do you sell?  I mean what, what is the secret to selling?
Speaker 2: Well one part of selling which helps is to actually believe in what you're selling.  That goes a long way.  And so I've learned that from, I mean early days.  I don't try to represent anything I don't believe in.  So that's the first, that's the first piece.  And then there are various sort of strategic things that you do in terms of understanding objections, figuring out creative ways to overcome those objections, really understanding, really understanding the situation and your, your audience.  And then figuring out ways that you can provide solutions to overcome any objections that they have.  And, and, and also I, I believe caring about the people that you are doing deals about.  Not making sure that it's not just going to be a one sided win is important too.  So people will do business with you again if they feel like they have also gained something from the relationship.  So it's important to make sure people feel good about the, the deals when they're done.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you weren't there long, right?
Speaker 2: I was there for two years.
Speaker 1: Two--okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Long enough--two, yeah definitely long enough.  I was, I was, I was in the back room of grocery stores with the cows hanging from the ceiling.  I was ready, ready to try something new.
Speaker 1: Right.  This is about the time they were calling Procter and Gamble the satanic soap company because of a logo or something. Isn't that correct (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's right.  Yeah that's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's the world we live in.
Story_ID: 636133
Speaker 1: So you got your B.A. [from the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia] in '92 [1992].  So you started at Procter and Gamble [Procter and Gamble Company] and then two years later in '94 [1994], you start working on your M.B.A. in--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --University of Virginia.
Speaker 2: No, I went down to Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina] for--
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right, Duke, that's right Duke.
Speaker 2: I went down to the Fuqua School of Business.
Speaker 1: Okay, the Fuqua School of Business and, all right so well tell us about Duke.  Were there any special instructors over there?
Speaker 2: I really enjoyed Duke.  I'll specifically say what I liked about Duke and one of the reasons that I went is because Duke at the time was trying--their goal and their vision was to get into the top three to five business schools in the country.  And at the time they were teeter- teetering around I believe like nine or ten or something like that.  And they knew that the, the companies, I'm sorry, the schools in the top three to five were institutions in this country; Harvard [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts], you know Stanford [Stanford Graduate School of Business, Stanford, California], et cetera.  All of these, these schools in the top, in the top business schools, Kellogg [Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois], et cetera.  And they decided that they were going to embrace technology, and they were not going to teach or do anything in the way that all the traditional schools did.  They were going to be very innovative and, and, and cutting edge and embracing technology, and teaching their students to work in a global community.  And so we were paperless in 1995.
Speaker 1: All right, now this is the beginning stages of the Internet (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Of the Internet, that's exactly right.  And--
Speaker 1: I remember the green screen computers that started to move off desks in the early '90s [1990s] and--
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.  That's exactly right.  So this is, this is right around that time.  And we were doing meetings with our teachers online.  We were in class already voting on things in class.  On, you know, through computers.  We were submitting our papers all online.  And that was very different than you know, the HBS' of the world at that time.  Like the way we did work and the way they saw themselves.  So they, they were going to be--they were going to embrace technology.  They were going to embrace the global community and, and figure out a way to win by doing that.  And I, and I loved being in that type of environment when there was a hunger to win as, as you know with the, the school itself.  And innovative--and the embracing of technology.
Story_ID: 636134
Speaker 1: Now Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina] is a fairly rich school from what I understand.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I think they, they took--by taking this path, they were able to fund it, everything and make sure that they had--
Speaker 2: Yes, I mean yeah, it's great, great school, great school.  And they also encourage--because they were focusing global- on globalization in business and, and a global community, they really encouraged us to do exchange programs.  So I did mine at the University of Cape Town [Cape Town, South Africa] in 1995 right after the end of apartheid.  Could not have been a better time to be there.  It was inspiring in many ways.  I--when I arrived, when I was there I was working in Khayelitsha [South Africa] which is one of the poor communities there in, in Cape Town [South Africa].  And working with blacks in, in Khayelitsha, talking about how--they wanted to build their own businesses and they were going to have their companies and talking about how to build skills.  I was working with one, one young man who wanted to build a bakery.  So I was helping him find funding for a bakery, for his equipment, et cetera.  There's another guy that wanted to start a fashion line.  And so it was very entrepreneurial at the time.  There was so much excitement and optimism about the future of what Africa was going to be now that apartheid was over.  And I had an opportunity to, to, to work with people in that very early stage, which was incredibly rewarding.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, now we've interviewed a few pe- people that went over to work in South Africa during that time period.  [HistoryMaker] Charlayne Hunter-Gault.
Speaker 2: Of course, who writes for The Root [theroot.com].
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah and I mean did--was there--the black community, I mean the African American community kind form a, a you know, sub-community there in South Africa?
Speaker 2: A little bit, yes.  I mean I was, I was primarily focused--I was at the university and most of my friends were all university students.  I went to--so it was very segregated.  They were just bringing blacks into the university because they wanted to teach them business school skills.  But many of them didn't have undergraduate degrees.  So they had a separate program for the black students.  And then they had the M.B.A. program for the white students.  So I went to school with the white students, but I lived with the black students.  So the--I lived in the dorms and stuff with many of the black students.  So I had a chance to go back and forth when I was there.  And--which was a great time.  I remember, I distinctly remember the O.J. [O.J. Simpson] verdict coming down when I was in Cape Town.  And we were all around the, around the television.  And some of the white students from America that had come over with me in my class--two, two or three of them.  They were sitting there.  And then there were two African American students that also came over.  And then the rest were all black Africans.  We're all waiting for the verdict to come down.  And they said not guilty.  The entire room erupted, all the Africans were toyi-toyi-ing and dancing and yelling and singing and doing all of this.  And I remember the, the white students just kind of sitting there staring at the TV.  And it was one of these very awkward moments.  Regardless of what you thought of the, the trial [People of the State of California v. Orenthal James Simpson, 1995] itself.  It was one of those just very awkward moments when the verdict came down.  And I just remember how excited--I was surprised at how excited the Africans were, that he was found not guilty.  So--
Story_ID: 636135
Speaker 1: Yeah we were just talking off camera about our impressions of the trial and I think we, we're in the, in the minority in thinking he actually did it, but he--the LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department] did it too, they framed him even though they didn't have to.  It, it appeared to me anyway.  But what, what did you think about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I thought--I thought he probably did it.  But it was one of those topics that people felt very strongly one way or the other.  In fact my father [Melvin Byrd] for years the way he would get people worked up at a dinner table or a conversation was he would just say out of the blue--everyone would be eating and having regular conversation.  And he'd say "O.J. [O.J. Simpson] was not guilty," or something like that.  And then everybody would just start to, you know, he would just start--he just enjoyed watching the whole place erupt.  But you know whether, whether you feel one way or another, you can't argue the fact that it was a very, it was a divisive period in our country.  And even in South Africa you could feel the tension between the races, so.
Story_ID: 636136
Speaker 1: I mean this is, this is quite an opp- opportunity.  You, you spent how many months there [Cape Town, South Africa]?
Speaker 2: So I was there from--I got there in early September and left in the end of December.  So just a few months.  But long enough to, I mean again back--circling back to race again.  I remember that everyone used to say to me, "You're not only white. What else are you?"  And I--it was such a difficult way for me to even think about myself because in the states people will say to me, "You're not only black. What are you? You know you're mixed.  What else are you mixed with?"  And, but, but my, my root and where I anchor is black.  And in Africa pe- the way people saw me is, was actually white and mixed with something.  And I really didn't know how to--it was very diff- I didn't, I never really processed that very well 'cause it just didn't fit with, with how I saw myself.  So I would explain that I'm, you know I'm a black American.  And they'd say, "But you're not black."  And then I would get very, very defensive, but I am black.  And so, so I remember that being just an interesting sort of point around race and my identity.
Story_ID: 636137
Speaker 1: So you come back in December and--so you finished up [at the Fuqua School of Business, Durham, North Carolina] in '94 [1994] I guess--no in, in ninety--
Speaker 2: Ninety-six [1996].
Speaker 1: --six, '96 [1996], okay.  All right.  What did you--did, did you think that the country was off to a good start?
Speaker 2: I thought that, I thought--I really enjoyed the optimism that existed.  I mean everyone was very optimistic.  I also saw the behind the scenes of what was going on from the business standpoint.  I did some work with a major consulting firm while I was down there and out there and they, they were talking about the lack of skills of blacks.  Basically there was all this optimism, there's this desire to run these corporations, to do these jobs but no one had been educated and, and, and they weren't trained to do these things.  So there was a big gap between desire and, and preparedness.  And, and so there was quite a bit of discussion going on at that point in time on how to get over that, that gap.  And, and so I was in meetings with you know, the consultants and white, very educated people, talking about this.  And then I would be back at the dorms (unclear) Khayelitsha [South Africa] and to see how excited people were about the future and think this is going to be a tougher road than you know.  But when I would try to explain that, no one wanted to really hear it because they were so excited.  And so I, I learned very--probably by month two or so to temper my desire to say well it's going to be a long process and things just don't happen overnight and even in the states when these types of things happen, there's lots of tension between the races and all of these things.  And I sort of--I just found that they didn't want to hear those stories.  And so--
Speaker 1: And we sit here today, like many years later, I mean it's a lot of disappointment in South Africa around the way things have moved.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: We've interviewed, we interviewed Phyllis Jackson [HistoryMaker Phyllis Tucker Vinson Jackson] and some other people that were in South Africa at the time and they, they related that they were sort of disappointed when they found out that African Americans--that there were like advantages set up for black people in South Africa, but they weren't for African Americans.  They were kind of disappointed to find out--they, they, they had business expertise.  And with the advantages that the South Africans had, they could have really pushed the accelerator down.  But they couldn't take advantage of them.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And the South Africans, many of them were not trained to take advantage of them.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  And it's a, it's a fascinating period of, of history that I was able to watch and, and I don't think I will ever forget the level of optimism that an entire people had about their future.  It was, it was infectious, quite contagious.
Story_ID: 636138
Speaker 1: So when you came back, you--you graduated [from the Fuqua School of Business, Durham, North Carolina] in '96 [1996].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you immediately joined Coca-Cola [The Coca-Cola Company, Atlanta, Georgia], right?
Speaker 2: I did, I went straight to Atlanta [Georgia] and started off in brand management at Coke.  So I was an assistant or associate brand manager and moved up into brand manager while I was there.  But right out of grad school I managed--I was on Coke Classic [Coca-Cola Classic].  So I mean you couldn't ask for anything cooler than that in my world, I was a marketer.  And so I--my first job out of business school is, is on, you know one of the top brands.  And--
Speaker 1: Coke Classic.  Now let's, let's, let's talk about that a second 'cause there's no, not, no longer any need now to talk classic versus any other kind.  But the--
Speaker 2: At the time--
Speaker 1: --the Coke experiment.  Now this, this happened in the '80s [1980s], right, the late '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Right, the late '80s [1980s] is when they changed from Coke to New Coke.  And then--and it was a terrible, terrible experiment, we'll call it.  And--
Speaker 1: Was the reason because of the competition with Pepsi [Pepsi-Cola; PepsiCo] and--
Speaker 2: Probably, probably the case.  They wanted--it was a little sweeter and all of those things and Pepsi, you know there was a little--they definitely changed the formula.
Speaker 1: Now I don't know, I've never see the stats, but I think most people from what I understand, Pepsi is considered sweeter than Coke.
Speaker 2: It is, yes.
Speaker 1: And so was then Coke felt it was--wasn't putting enough sugar in Coke or something?
Speaker 2: You know I, I just know they wanted to change it, they thought it was smart to change the formula.  It was a bit sweeter and it was, and, and the entire--I mean country, just you know was in an uproar.  Like why did you change Coke, the formula of Coke?  And you know depending on how you look at it, it was a huge, huge mistake.  But when they brought back the, when they brought back the classic Coke, basically what was originally Coke, the numbers soared.  People wanted to go back and they just wanted to have their old Coke again.  So it actually--when you look at the numbers and you look at how--like sort of in retrospect, it was a great move for the company.  People expressed their love for the brand.  They wanted to come back, all of those things.  And it was a great move.  But I don't think that was, I don't think that was the plan going in to changing the, the, the formula.  But I had a chance to work on the brand, which was just exciting.  I did out of home advertising.  So I did all the billboards.  I was the national--any billboards that you saw around the time that had anything to do with Coke, that was my project.  And I--and then I did some--my boss and I did radio.  He did more radio than I, but I did some radio.  And, and then the, the heads of the, the team all did television ads.  Even though we were all involved in the TV, the Coke TV ads.
Speaker 1: Okay, now I'm sure that Coke had a lot of older people at one time like working the--doing your job.  Now this in the--hiring you, you're young, you've got this M.B.A.  It was an attempt to like pump some new life into Coke ads and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know if they were--yeah they were bringing in, they were hiring groups of M.B.A.'s.  And in fact the class behind me, some of the things that they--some of those folks have done has just been amazing.  I mean we've--they were definitely hiring lots of M.B.A.'s in to ultimately run these brands.  And when you think about it, they were targeting teenagers, you know young people for the most part, and young mothers.  So it's not a complete disconnect that you would have--you would want an infusion of young people coming in and learning how to manage the brands and, and communicate the, the right mess- the appropriate messages, and understanding again back to what I was talking about before, understanding the audience.  So it's not--it, it would make sense that they, that they wanted to begin growing the talent from an M.B.A. pool, a young M.B.A. pool.
Speaker 1: Now Coca-Cola has been said, I heard not too long ago, that Coca-Cola sells syrup, basically, that's basically it.  And then advertises the syrup--I mean that they dis- distribute to these, these bottling companies (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's correct.
Speaker 1: Around the country.
Speaker 2: That's correct, that's right.  So--but it's, it's you know, it's a distribution company for sure.
Story_ID: 636139
Speaker 1: There's a great company--I mean I was living in Atlanta, Georgia, working for Coca-Cola [The Coca-Cola Company], you know it doesn't get much better for tha- than that, at least not in the South.  So I was having, I was having a great time.  And I, I stayed on Coke Classic [Coca-Cola Classic], and then I moved to--I remember this so well.  I moved to new brands.  So I was already starting to show a strong interest in being an entrepreneur.  And I moved to the new brands team. And so the guy--the new brands team was very tiny.  I think there were four or five of us.  And two of us were on the brand Citra [Coca-Cola Citra], and Citra was a--basically Fresca with sugar.  But it was a brand that we launched in 8 percent of the United States.  And I was on that brand, I helped launch it, doing all the packaging and all of the stuff for Citra.  And, and the guy that sat right next to me was working on this water product in secret.  And it was called Dasani.  And I remember the day we chose the name Dasani.  I remember the hue of--we were, we were looking at the hues of the plastic.  If you ever look at a Dasani bottle, there's a light, light blue hue in the plastic.  And we were--we had all of the different plastics up and we were trying to--the different colors and he had all these bottles.  I mean just bottles everywhere.  And we were just trying--which one looks most refreshing.  And we'd spend hours looking at these things and the Dasani label.  I mean all of the blues and everything.  This, this guy was doing most of the work--no all the work on it.  And he sat right next to me.  So I, I, I was there for the beginning of Dasani.
Speaker 2: What is the--
Speaker 1: It doesn't mean anything.
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were trying to find--they were, they were specifically trying to find a word that did not mean anything in any language.  So they wanted to make up a word that felt refreshing, that felt like it had some--like I don't even remember it.  But they were--I think they thought it felt like it had some native roots in America or something like that, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah I thought about it being some kind of a desert or some oasis or you know you hear Dasani.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Then I thought it might be French from the, you know Alps or something.  You know I mean different, different things come to mind.
Speaker 1: As long as they're all positive, I think everyone was good (laughter) with it.  So.
Story_ID: 636140
Speaker 1: It was, it was an exciting time to be there.  And I was really--I was having a great time on new brands.  And, and then something happened that was a real turning point in my career.  And basically the--I, I--right when we finished Citra [Coca-Cola Citra], we were doing so well in the communities that we had launched, the new locations that we'd launched, that we began cannibalizing Sprite.  And so they started pulling back on some of the funding because they didn't want to cannibalize one of their major brands, it doesn't make--it didn't make any sense.
Speaker 2: What do you, what do you mean in terms of cannibalizing?
Speaker 1: Meaning people were moving from drinking--we were in primarily a lot of Hispanic markets.  And instead of buying Sprite, they were starting to buy Citra.  And so the concern was that--one of the concerns was they were--they didn't want to cannibalize one of their own brands.
Speaker 2: So it was winning at the expense of--
Speaker 1: Of Sprite, right.  It would have been different if it was at the expense of a competitive brand.
Speaker 2: Or 7-Up or something.
Speaker 1: Or--that's right.  But it was winning at the expense of Sprite.
Speaker 2: Okay now did Citra taste like Sprite?
Speaker 1: No, it's sweeter and the taste has a little bit more of a grapefruit taste.  It's definitely--it's like Fresca with--but it has sugar.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: If you've ever had Fresca.  And so, and so we did well and I, I, I thought I was going to get a promotion 'cause there were only two of us on the team, my boss and me.  And he for personal reasons, had a lot of stuff going on.  And I did a lot of work that year to get us to launch.  And I thought I actually deserved a promotion.  And I'm not one to--I was not one to really boast about my performance, but I felt in my, my gut I felt like I deserved a promotion, and I didn't get it.  And the gentleman who was making the decisions basically told me that he just didn't think I was--just didn't think it was the right time or something like that.  He didn't have any sub- substantive feedback.  He just didn't feel like it was the right time to promote me.
Speaker 2: What was the relative position of women at Coca-Cola [The Coca-Cola Company, Atlanta, Georgia], and--
Speaker 1: Had a strong group of women.  Strong M.B.A.'s too.  Like it was--I don't remember there being a big--it was definitely heavily male.  It was more male.  And of course more white.  Very few--there were a few minorities that were there, blacks that were there.  Maybe one or two Hispanic women, Latino women.  But for the most--I don't remember any Latino men off the top of my head.  Anyway, so what they did is they moved me over to--instead of promoting up into new business which was what I was expecting, they moved me to the--to oversee--they moved me back to Coke Classic [Coca-Cola Classic].  Basically need--they needed someone to run minority businesses for Coke Classic.  And that was a lateral move, not a promoted, promoted move.  So they moved me back over to Coke Classic.  And I headed up African American and Hispanic marketing for Coke Classic.  And I have to tell you I went--I was, I was very disappointed.  I didn't want the job.  I was very upset because my budget was being--I was going to have a very small budget to manage at the time.  I--and I just felt like I was being pushed somewhere that they didn't have anyone else to fill.  I just didn't feel like it was--it didn't feel like it was a big move for me.  And in retrospect, I wouldn't be where I am today if that hadn't happened.  No question about it.  Because in that job I met Tom Joyner.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, and I wound up working for Tom years later.  But I never would have known him, I never would have been exposed to the work that he wanted to do if I hadn't actually--if that hadn't happened.  Anyway, they wound--I wound up getting over and then they promoted me.

Speaker 1: Now did you work with Burrell Advertising [Burrell Advertising Agency; Burrell Communications Group] in Chicago [Illinois] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did.  Yeah, Burrell, I mean I know all of the--I--all of the, the black agencies.  I worked with all of them at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  I know Burrell had Coke, had the Coke contract (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  Yep, I know the--I know Tom [HistoryMaker Thomas J. Burrell] and McGhee Williams [McGhee Williams Osse] and all of those guys when I was in my, my twenties.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what I was getting at before when I asked about the relative position of women at Coca-Cola [The Coca-Cola Company, Atlanta, Georgia], but was it a--you just told a story of hitting a glass ceiling, since.  Was this the usual thing that happens to women at Coke?  Or to African American women? Or African American people (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know.  I didn't have--there weren't many African American women around, there were a couple.  Candace Matthews was there when I--by the time I had already moved over, back over to Coke [Coca-Cola Classic], she came.  And at the time I felt, I did feel like there was a little bit of, of old boy network.  The gentleman that made the promotion and the guy that--my boss that got promoted, they were both HBS [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts] grads.  I think a year, a couple of years apart, but they were both you know, same school and, and I was coming from Duke [Fuqua School of Business, Durham, North Carolina] and I was a black woman.  And my boss actually said to me, "You deserve to be promoted, I'm sorry."  And that, you know that's--so I just remember this sick feeling and just feeling like I had been robbed of something that I, that I'd worked really hard for.  And my boss even supported the fact that I should have been--you know I should have been promoted.  And--but you know things work out in life.  They may not be the path that you choose, but they wind up getting you to the place where you're supposed to be.  And I, you know I look back on that, that moment all the time.  I tell people when I, when I talk to younger people about their careers, I talk about the fact that sometimes you might want to get to point, you know point B, but the path to get there might not be exactly what you planned.  And that oddly enough sometimes the detours that you take wind up being very helpful for you later on in your career.  And that's what happened to me.
Story_ID: 636142
Speaker 1: You were with Coke [The Coca-Cola Company, Atlanta, Georgia] from '96 [1996] until--?
Speaker 2: Ninety-nine [1999].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was itching to get out into that, the Internet space.
Speaker 1: Now you were introduced to something called ezgov.com? Is that--
Speaker 2: I was.  So I went over and worked for--I left Coke and as a brand manager on Coke Classic [Coca-Cola Classic], and I went over as a twenty-nine year old VP of sales and marketing.  Everybody had VP in all these kind of great titles when everybody was in their twenties right around the Internet time.  It was a great, it was sort of a fun period for young technologists and entrepreneurs that were starting businesses.  And I went over and worked for EzGov [EzGov, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia].  I remember leaving Coke because when I put in my resignation, within forty-eight hours I had met with every senior vice president and the president of, of Coke U.S., U.S.A. because they all wanted to know why I was leaving.  And they had me in everyone's office, "Why are you going?"  And I remember a woman saying to me, one of the top women that was at the company, she said, "Why, why are you doing this?"  She said, "Don't you know that one day you're going to--." She said, "Right now you can walk into any room and you can say 'I'm with The Coca-Cola Company,' and everyone's going to respect you."  And she said, "And you're going to go off somewhere and you're going to have to walk out somewhere and they're not going to know what it is," and she's like, "Why are you going to do that?  You're going to lose all of that, you know that immediate respect."  And I said, "You know hopefully one day I'll build something and I'll walk into the room of something that I've helped to build, and maybe, maybe they'll be, they'll respect me for something that I've helped to build in this technology space.  And that sounds kind of cool to me."
Story_ID: 636143
Speaker 1: And so I left and went to EzGov [EzGov, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia] and we were putting government services online. Your property taxes, your parking tickets, all these things in 1999.  So it was a fascinating space to be in, and an exciting time to be in the Internet.  It sort of just about the bubble, just around the time of the bubble.
Speaker 2: A lot of Internet companies that sprung up in the '90s [1990s].
Speaker 1: Right, right before--that's exactly right.  It was a fun place to be and I was, I have, I have always been an entrepreneur at heart.  And I traveled with the then chairman of the company.  We traveled around the country talking to state and--state and local government representatives about putting their services online.  And this was, I mean this was cutting edge back then.  The, the thought of actually paying your property tax or paying a parking ticket online was so farfetched.  You know people were like that makes sense, but no one was doing it.  And so we went county after county, state after state, selling into these, these local markets.  So it's still--the company is still in business.  They do, they do sort of different things now, but this company, EzGov is still in business.
Speaker 2: So what was it--were there, were there any strategic victories along the way?  Did you get a, you know a certain city or a certain you know, administration to latch onto it that, that made it work?
Speaker 1: We had a few.  We had some in Ohio and, trying to think, somewhere out in the Midwest.  I don't remember exactly now.  But--and we were so excited.  And they--we had great techn- I mean the, the staff at EzGov was so impressive, the technology guys were just amazing.  All of them out of Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia], and they were all friends.  They'd all started this company.  But they were very, very smart and, and everyone cared about revolutionizing the space.  And I remember the chairman, his name was Bryan Mundy, he would always see us and would run by and he'd say, "How does it feel to be changing the world?"  And that's how he'd greet us in the morning.  "Good morning.  How does it feel to be changing the world?"
Speaker 2: And as we know now the world did change (unclear).
Speaker 1: It did.
Speaker 2: So you can pay everything online.
Speaker 1: That's exactly right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Exactly right.
Speaker 2: Now you were with them as the world approached the millennium, right?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And the--do you remember the Y2K [Year 2000] scare?
Speaker 1: I definitely remember that, yes.  Definitely remember.  When everyone thought that the--everything was going to come to a complete halt.  We were going to lose all--every bit of data that we had as a global community.  I, I don't re- I remember all the--I mean backing up everything and all the things that we had to do right around that time.
Speaker 2: Did the EzGov people consider that to be a threat, or--?
Speaker 1: (Nods head) I think everyone did.  No one knew, exactly knew what was going to happen.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I'm surprised 'cause I, I kind of thought it was phony at the time.  I saw a lot of the--
Speaker 1: I think people--I think the folks that I worked with.  I don't think anyone really thought anything was going to happen, but, but it made sense to be cautious and to be prepared in the event that something did happen.  So--but a great team of guys.  They were all--there was one female that worked there when I got there.  All the rest were men.  I was the only black person, and the only black woman in the senior admin- the senior, the senior team.
Speaker 2: But in 2001 Bryan Mundy passed away, right?
Speaker 1: He did.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He died in a house fire from smoke inhalation, very sad.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So then did that just kind of stop EzGov (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It didn't.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They actually kept it going.  I mean it's still--the company's still in business.  But that was a very sad story.
Story_ID: 636144
Speaker 1: Okay now in 2001 you helped Tom Joyner launch a big project.  I know my mother talks about it all the time, so--
Speaker 2: Does she?
Speaker 1: Yeah. This is a--
Speaker 2: So Tom asked me, Tom may have asked me four times I think.  He said--he calls me by my full name--sorry.  He calls me [HistoryMaker] Donna Byrd.  And so he would call, "Donna Byrd," you know, "I'm going to start this black news site.  Come on down and help us run it."  And I would say, "Tom, I'm--I don't think I'm, I'm going to do--I don't think--I don't want to move to Dallas [Texas].  I don't think I'm going to do that."  Came back again, "Donna Byrd," you know, "why don't you come down here and help us run this thing?"  And, and then finally he called.  "Donna Byrd, what's it gonna take to get you to come down here?"  And so I sat down and I--he said, "Send me the list in the next fifteen minutes."  Or, "Fax me the list."  Tom never did email, he always had a fax machine.  So I wrote down some crazy list of things that it would take for me.  I needed to fly back and forth.  I didn't want to move to Atlanta--D.C.--in Dallas full time.  I needed to live in Atlanta [Georgia] and Dallas and needed to be able to fly back and forth every week.  I was dating someone seriously at the time in Atlanta.  And that was important to me.  And so I faxed it over to him and he called me back within seconds.  "Done.  Can you be here on Monday?"  And so that started my tenure at Black America Web.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what was the--what was their--what was Tom Joyner's concept for blackamericaweb.com?
Speaker 2: He wanted to start a smart news, black news site.  And, and he did, we did, all of us did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was on the business side trying to figure out ways to monetize the tra- the traffic.  And then I was--and then there were two people on the editorial side that were working.
