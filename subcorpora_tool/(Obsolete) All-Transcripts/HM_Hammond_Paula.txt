Story_ID: 24349
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we always ask, and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Great.
Speaker 1: The first one is:  Do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I have multiple favorite foods (laughs).  Multiple favorite foods.  Oh, gosh.  I love food.  So, I like--a brief answer is probably not possible.  I like most foods most of the time (laughs).
Speaker 1: Is there a genre of food you would like to list?
Speaker 2: I love Thai food, I love Chinese food and Japanese food.  I love certain forms of Italian food.  I really like--I love barbeque and collard greens, and holiday food like ham; all of those good things.  And let's see, fried chicken, which I hardly ever eat, but especially in Boston because you cannot find it.  Let's see.  I like various forms of fish.  I love trying new kinds of food.  I love spicy foods, and Mexican, I love New Orleans-style food, and I like cooking.  I like food (laughs).
Speaker 1: You were right when you said that.
Speaker 2: I said, oh, my God, how can that be brief (laughs).
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Oh.  When I grew up I had a favorite color.  My favorite color was blue and then moved to red, and then moved on to yellow.  Right now I have a strong love for any rich, intense color.  I love blues, yellows, golden colors.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: The fall.  I love the fall.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Right now it's Aruba, but Hawaii, you know, if I could get there more frequently that would be it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is:  Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I don't think that I do.  Maybe someone else would disagree, but I don't think that I have a favorite phrase or saying.  There are probably some quotes that I think are memorable.  There was one by Martin Luther King.  I'm trying to get it right.  But, basically, it means that, science informs--basically, it's about the fact that science and religion are not opposed to each other, they compliment each other.  And I'll have to find quote.  I actually know where I can find it, but I'm not quite--I don't want to mess up Martin Luther King's words (laughs).
Speaker 1: Well, that's a good clue for whoever is watching this.  They could probably find it--
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: --from what you've been able to tell us.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely.
Story_ID: 24350
Speaker 1: So, I'm going to ask about your family history now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family separately from your father's side.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And then we'll put them together.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: So, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Della Mae McGraw.  D-E-L-L-A, M-A-E, and then M-C-G-R-A-W.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is her--now is--yes.  So that--McGraw is her maiden name?
Speaker 2: McGraw is her maiden name.  My parents are divorced, and so McGraw is her maiden name.  That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother's is November 21st, 1931.  She was born in Claremore, Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How do you spell Claremore.
Speaker 2: C-L-A-R-E-M-O-R-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family, and what were they doing in Claremore or any other place where they--
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mother is the daughter of a Baptist preacher and his wife.  And her father, James McGraw, married her mother, Allie McGraw (ph. splg.).  They actually ran off from Little Rock, Arkansas, to Claremont, Oklahoma; got married, and he started his ministry in that area.  I think at the time they eloped, and I don't know the details about that except that there may have been some disagreement about whether the match was a good one for Allie at the time.  He was just starting off as a preacher and didn't have a congregation.  He started his congregation in Claremore, and they had four children, and my mother was the baby of that group.
Speaker 1: Now, they ran away from where?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: They ran away from Little Rock, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Little Rock.
Speaker 2: From Arkansas, exactly.
Speaker 1: Little Rock, Arkansas.  Now, it's interesting.  Your grandmother has the name of Allie McGraw, so she is the Allie McGraw, and the other Ali MacGraw is the--
Speaker 2: Yes (laughs).  She came first.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  She came first.
Speaker 2: And before she married James McGraw her name was Allie Meadows.  But having married James McGraw, she became the Allie McGraw.  That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Just want to clear that up.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: So, what denomination was your grandfather or Reverend?
Speaker 2: Baptist.  Yes, he was a Baptist preacher.
Speaker 1: Now, can you go back any further than that?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Allie McGraw, her mother was Henrietta, and, hopefully, I have this correct.  My mother will definitely correct me if I get it wrong, but for now my memory is that Henrietta Meadows was the daughter of slaves.  So, you know, if they're going back a couple of generations, and Henrietta was born to her mother, and her mother was the daughter of slaves.  Now, I want to make sure I get this correct so that's why I'm hesitating a little bit.  You know, I believe, actually, that Allie--what I'm thinking of is James McGraw's mother and not Allie's mother.  That goes back, because at this point, this is where the McGraw name came from.  It came from a Scot-Irish slave owner, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now is there--there a story about either your grandfather or grandmother's side of the family being from some other place in the South or some other place in--
Speaker 2: Other than Arkansas?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, my mother's side, the best I can remember is all Arkansas and then that wing from Oklahoma, to the best of my knowledge, from this group, from the McGraws and the Meadows.  There are now family members in Chicago, and I'm not quite sure how the Meadows, some of them ended up in Chicago, and there are McGraws in Detroit, and I think that happened around the same time, during the '50s [1950s], when people were moving towards jobs and opportunities.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, your grandfather had a church in Claremore, Oklahoma.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And what did your grandmother do, Allie McGraw?
Speaker 2: Oh, Allie--so she was a stay-at-home mom, and she raised the kids.  My mother was one of four, so there were actually two boys and two girls.  And--so she was essentially the preacher's wife (laughs).  And both my mother's parents died when my mother was a child.  First, you know, my mother's mother died, and then her father passed away.  I believe she was around twelve when that happened.
Speaker 1: Now where did--did she live with relatives then afterwards.
Speaker 2: Yes.  After that, she and my Aunt Gladys, her sister, moved to Little Rock, again, and my mother was raised by my auntie, Nettie Blackmon (ph. splg.), who had a store that she ran with her daughter Robbie Morgan and her husband.  And so, my mother went to live with her family there and went to school at Paul Dunbar High School, which still has class reunions; one of the oldest black high schools in Little Rock at that time.
Speaker 1: Right.  Now, that's the school that the students who integrated Central High School left from to go to--
Speaker 2: I do believe so.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) (simultaneous)--the North Central.
Speaker 2: That's right.  They really have a very proud history, and my mother goes back to the reunion periodically to see that group again.  She has a number of memories from that that she shared with me.
Story_ID: 24351
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did she tell you about growing up in Oklahoma and about, you know, Dunbar High School and growing up in Arkansas?
Speaker 2: My mother [Della Mae McGraw] seemed to have a really nice childhood in terms of the experiences that she had and the things that she enjoyed.  When she was in Claremore, she remembers playing in the backyard, making mud pies, doing all of the little girl things that you do.  She talks about, and I think she even wrote a poem about a memory of her mother that she had when she was growing up caring for her when she was playing out in the backyard.  She has very strong memories of being the baby, because her brothers and sisters were all significantly older than her.  I think between eight and more years older than her.  So, there were these older siblings who really took care of her and watched out for her.  She remembers, you know, stick candy and, you know, getting dressed up for church, you know, with the patent leather and the fancy little socks and all of those things.  So, she has memories that I think are very strong.  She has very strong memories of her father, who was a very fiery preacher and, you know, spoke with great conviction.  So she remembers going to church and hearing her father speak and, you know, singing and joining in with the congregation.  And she remembers, you know, the community that her father's church created.  She has very strong memories of that.  And the fact that her father was kind of a very thoughtful person, kind of a philosopher, her father would write poems on the side as well and had written a poem about faith and, you know, and about, you know, the choices that man makes.  So, her father had left some things like that for her.  She still has a stick pin.  Her father was a man of style, and she still has a stick pin that was kind of fancy, carved from bone, and it had sort of these crystals on it, and it was something that her father would put on on Sunday.  It was part of, you know--you know, presenting yourself in your best form.  And, I think I can see, you know, that thing continuing with my mother.  And she actually passed that on to my brother, who's a poet, very recently.  And it was actually a real thrill to see that, see that exchange because it has such meaning.  But, she has many strong memories of both parents.  And when she moved to Little Rock, she has memories of her auntie.  She remembers helping out in her cousin Robbie's store, and again, because of the large age range in the family, I think at that time just she and her sister were there; her brother had joined the army.  I think another brother had already finished the term in the army, if I'm correct.  So, she was really growing up with her cousins, and she formed close relationships with them.  And she went to school at Paul Lawrence Dunbar High.  There's a large sense of pride there.  So, my mother had a sense of style too.  She still does.  And I've seen pictures of her, and she's looking good then.  You know, among her classmates she was someone who was active in high school.  She was, you know, someone who was engaged, and so, my sense is that my other had a great experience in high school as well and decided that she would study nursing.  She studied nursing at Howard University [Washington, District of Columbia]  and then at Wayne State she completed her master's.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, she finished her bachelor's in science and nursing at Howard.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then she went to Wayne State [Detroit, Michigan], and by that time, many members of the Little Rock, Arkansas, family had already moved up to Detroit from Arkansas, including the aunt that raised her, whom we called Auntie, Nettie Blackmon and my cousin Robbie with the general store.  All of those, that entire group had sort of moved up and out.  So there're still family members in Little Rock, but the group in Detroit is much larger.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And this would be the '50s [1950s] going into the '60 [1960s].
Speaker 1: Right.  Your mother would have graduated from high school in '48 [1948], I guess, right, if she's (unclear) (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: Something like that.  That's sounds right.
Speaker 1: If she came out at 18--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --high school in '48 [1948].
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right.  '48 [1948], '49 [1949].  Then, if we go through college and, yeah, we're going into the mid-'50s [1950s], you're entering the mid-'50s [1950s].  So, yeah, that's about right.
Story_ID: 24352
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  So, that's--so, did your mother always want to be a nurse or did she have--?
Speaker 2: I--I don't know if she had thought about other things.  I think for certain that nursing was something that the mom that I knew had fully adopted as part of who she was.  And, I can say that because she was a nurse acting in the field, but she also established a school of nursing in Detroit [Michigan] at the Wayne County Community College [Detroit, Michigan], WC3, we call it.  It was the first school of nursing that, essentially, the primary community college for Detroit had offered.  And, she launched the program and began the dean of nursing for the school.  So, I don't know if my mother may have considered other careers.  I don't remember her telling me about other careers she thought about, but I do think that she was very close to nursing, and she was very close to education, and always very close to public health.  She sent me encyclopedias of illnesses and things of this nature.  So, I think it is in her nature to inquire about the health of others and to monitor it.  So I think that's something she was very clued in on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she share any stories about Howard [Howard University, Washington, District of Columbia]?  In those days, it was--I don't know, the doctors there were like pioneers, you know, in the days of--she may have--she probably just missed Charles Drew.
Speaker 2: She must have.  I don't remember my mother's stories about Howard, if she did share them.  I remember more about the life in Little Rock [Arkansas] and more stories about getting started in Detroit.  And so, and yeah, and I'm not sure how long program was at that time.  But it may have been that she was in--at Howard for two and a half or three years.  I'm not sure how--what the duration of the program was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she went to Wayne State [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan] to finish the bachelor's and then get a master's?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That's right.
Speaker 1: You know, they had, like, a certificate program or something, or nursing or nursing certificate or something like that.
Speaker 2: That's right.  She got her master's or her master certificate in nursing at Wayne State University.  At that time she was working at Boulevard General Hospital.  And so, she was doing shifts there, and somehow through that loop she met my father, who was--who got his Ph.D. at Wayne State University.  All of these buildings are located near each other or not far from each other.  So, I don't know the story of how they met, but I do know that they had to be moving back and forth in each other's circles for a little while.
Story_ID: 24353
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, let's go to your father then. Can you give us his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It's Jesse, J-E-S-S-E, Francis, F-R-A-N-C-I-S, Goodwin, G-O-O-D-W-I-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: All right.  So, he was born February 7th, 1929, in Greenville, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Greenville, South Carolina.  Now, what do you know about your father's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Let me see.  My father's parents, his mother was essentially--I'm going through one of my brain freezes here--but grandma was essentially born and raised in South Carolina as far as I can remember, and his dad, I believe, is from South Carolina as well.  When they got married they had three children, and I have two aunts, Aunt Naomi and Aunt Vera, and my father was the boy and the oldest of that group.  Now, my grandmother did have a child from a previous marriage or relationship from what I remember, and that child also had children, so that we have additional cousins from those children.  And, I'm trying to go back further.  If I go back further I know that we have these wonderful pictures of my grandmother's family where she is this tiny, three-year-old, the youngest of what looked like fourteen or fifteen children, in a rural area in South Carolina.  And, if I try and go back further, though, I know that my cousins have some information on this, but I can't pull from my mind further information about that family.  I remember that--hearing some stories about my grandmother's family, and it was a farm life or rural life.  They all a lot to do, and there's an advantage to having all of the children, and mother was frequently pregnant and a hardworking woman.  And their life was, you know, kind of, you know, their life was--things weren't easy, so it was kind of tight.  But they all seemed very close.  And again, the baby story prevails because Grandma was the baby and, therefore, somewhat, you know, lavished on, adored.  She has a great sense of humor, loves to laugh, you know.  So, she actually passed that trait on to my aunt Vera.  But, yeah, in general, when I try to go further back it's a little bit harder.  Frances Byrd (ph. splg.) was her name before she got married.  And, B-Y-R-D.  And I knew some of my uncles.  I had an uncle, Jim Byrd.  I remember a few other uncles from the same group.  But a number of them had passed away while I was small and growing up.  Now, my grandfather's name is Jesse Goodwin, without the "F."  And so, it's the same name, and he actually was in the Navy.  But before that, I can't remember a lot of information.  Again, I think that there may be information available if I go to Greenville and I probe the right kin.  But it turns out that between my grandmother and my grandfather, a large number of the people gathered around on any given holiday, were related to my grandmother.  And I know that I had an aunt Naomi for whom, you know, I had an older aunt Naomi for whom my direct aunt was named.  And she was on my grandfather's side, and I knew her well, and she lived nearby.  And I knew a few more of the Goodwins, but not a large number of them compared to the Byrds, that seemed to have large numbers present at any occasion.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that's as far back as I can go.  And it's--I know that my father inquired some, but I don't know if--I think that I'd heard things about possibly George and South Carolina being connected through my grandfather.  But that's about as far as I can get.
Story_ID: 24354
Speaker 1: Now, your father ended up with a Ph.D.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was he--did his family have a tradition of going to college?
Speaker 2: No.  My father was the first to go to college, and essentially, he had an unusual sort of path, because when he was growing up the family was United Methodists, but he actually went to a Catholic school where he met a priest, Father Gordon, who kind of took him under his wing and sort of nurtured him.  And when it was time for him to finish school, he was already thinking about college and preparing himself for college.  So, he was a very--very directed person.  My aunt Vera describes my father as very serious (laughs) and very focused.  So, he was a young man who was just bent on achieving certain things.  He actually got a scholarship to go to Xavier [Xavier University, New Orleans, Louisiana], and my understanding is that it was a scholarship that some of the priests who had mentored him directed him towards.  So, it may--I haven't--I'm not clear on this, but it may have been sponsored by the Catholic Church.  And at some point, my father converted to Catholicism.  So, my whole growing up was a Catholic upbringing with a Baptist and United Methodist relatives.  Now, my father went to Xavier University, which also has a Catholic charter.  He studied pharmaceutical sciences, and--
Speaker 1: This is interesting because even back then, you know, Xavier is known for its School of Pharmacy now.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: This is Xavier in New Orleans.
Speaker 2: This is Xavier in New Orleans.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: This is Xavier in New Orleans, and you're absolutely right.  He went to the School of Pharmacy, and he got his pharmacist degree.  He actually loved New Orleans, and I think, still has very good memories of New Orleans.  He then went on to Detroit.  He had been admitted into a graduate school in biochemistry in Detroit, and his advisor had been able to find funding for him.  And he did his Ph.D. work at Wayne in basically a biochemical focus in his work.  He completed his degree, and I could probably help bring back the year, but perhaps not at this very moment, but he finished his degree around '59 [1959] or this timeframe.  And it was around a similar timeframe that he met my mother.  My mother and father married, I believe, in December of 1960 or--no.  Maybe 1959, December of 1959; so maybe all of this was--this is all very close in time.  And my brother was born February of 1962.  So, my father, by that time, had, I think he may have worked briefly at a hospital in analysis, but he secured a position in the Detroit City Health Department.  And growing up, he--my whole growing up period he was the director of the health laboratories for the city of Detroit.  So, when my mother and father got married, it was, you know, unusual.  And, yet, again, it was also a Detroit story because Detroit has--had this population of black folks who were coming from the South, and maybe were the first in their family to get degrees and were beginning to establish a black middle-class in Detroit.  So, my mother meets my father, and one's a master's degree and one's a Ph.D., and they're both from families where they may be the only one who has a degree, because also was the only one who had gone on beyond, certainly beyond the bachelor's, but I believe, at that time, was one of the first to go on to get even a bachelor's degree.  My aunts and uncles--my aunt and uncles did not have bachelor's degrees.  So, I think it was interesting that--and it's probably clear why they had connections, you know, that they had a common focus.
Story_ID: 24355
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your father [Jesse Francis Goodwin], like, was employed by the health department in Wayne County or Detroit?
Speaker 2: It was the city of Detroit.
Speaker 1: City of Detroit.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm, that's right.  And so, he was responsible for public health issues related to the city, and he did work with the county in some of these issues.  But, certainly as, everything from water quality, ground quality.  In his role, he, as a biochemist, his leanings were analytical chemistry, so his role was actually to run a large analytical laboratory which monitored some of the aspects of things like water quality, quality of the grounds, and so forth and so on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's pretty good.  So, did he have success fairly quickly?  After he got his Ph.D., did he - -
Speaker 2: It seems to me that he began to run this lab when I was pretty young, so I guess you could say yes, yeah.  And he seemed to really, you know, enjoy his job, and he also was involved in some other things.  He was a member of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] chapter and became president of that, of the Detroit chapter for some time.  And that was a large part of his activity, I would say, was heavily toward organizations like NAACP and the Urban League.  And, he's also an Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Incoroporated], so he was involved Alpha Phi Alpha and all of the activities associated with it as well.  And there was just an entire sort of Detroit community of public service combined with trying to enact power, trying to enable the black community in many different ways.  So, he was very much involved in that.  He was heavily involved with the political scene, and he was a delegate for the local Democratic Party.  So, I walked - - I mean, as kids, I have memories of walking up and down the streets with him and putting little brochures in the doors with the rubber band for certain candidates, and so forth.
Speaker 1: Now, was he part of the Coleman Young Campaign?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm sure he was.  I certainly remember that he was heavily involved in Coleman Young in the first year that he ran.  And I don't know if he was a part of the Coleman's campaign or just in general as a member of the Democratic--as a delegate for the Democratic Party, he would have been involved anyway.
Speaker 1: Now, I can imagine, I don't know, you may have been too young, but I can imagine there was probably quite a primary fight--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --between white candidates and Coleman Young.
Speaker 2: I can--you know, I believe you.  In fact, what I would hear a lot growing up were political discussions that my mother [Della Mae McGraw] and father would have about what so and so was trying to pull, and what, you know.  I heard of that about the political climate and how positioning was taking place to try and discredit particular black candidates at that time, and, yes; I definitely think that my father was heavily involved in that arena in terms of support, and in terms of essentially gathering the community to bring things together.  I even remember NAACP meetings in our house.  So, yeah, he was very active on those fronts.
Speaker 1: Now, you were what--Coleman Young was elected, what, in 1970?
Speaker 2: You're probably right.  Now, that history I don't have the numbers right.  But a large part of my preteen and teen years and beyond, he was the mayor.  So that must mean that--see, I was born in '63 [1963]--it had to be early '70s [1970s], because by the time we get to 1976, when I'm starting high school, we have the Renaissance Center, and the new Detroit era, and Coleman Young's picture was everywhere.  I mean, he had become a part of Detroit.  So '72 [1972] is probably right.
Speaker 1: Probably so.  I'm thinking maybe--
Speaker 2: Because '68 [1968] sounds a little too early.
Speaker 1: Yeah, '68 [1968] was Carl Stokes in Cleveland.  He was the first, '69 [1969], the mayor in Gary.  And I can't think of his name now, in Gary, was Richard Hatcher; yeah, was the mayor of Gary.
Speaker 2: Wow.  That name is familiar.
Speaker 1: Those were the first two, and then there was one in New Jersey, and then, you know, so--
Speaker 2: It's a beginning.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a beginning.  And certainly by, I think, the early '70s [1970s], Carl Stokes was--I mean--
Speaker 2: Coleman Young.
Speaker 1: --Coleman Young was the mayor of Detroit.
Speaker 2: That sounds right to me, because it was--the Renaissance Center was one of his signature efforts to bring community in to Downtown, and that had to have happened in the '72 [1972], '76 [1976] term.  By '76 [1976] it was already--this new structure, we were going to see it, and, you know, everyone was sort of gathering around to check it out.  Yeah, I definitely remember that.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, this is like a golden era for black Detroit?
Speaker 2: It is.  And black politics and the growth of the middle class in Detroit or the strengthening of it.  I think between the time I was born and as I left high school, that was a very strong period.
Speaker 1: Yeah, people in the rest of the Midwest looked at Detroit like New York City or something.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: It was the home of Motown.
Speaker 2: The big city that was home to--yeah, home of Motown, the place to get discovered.
Speaker 1: Cars.
Speaker 2: Cars (laughs).  Exactly.
Speaker 1: Style.  Style, yeah.
Speaker 2: And style.  Yes, yes.  There's still discussion about, you know, ladies in Detroit and their hairstyles.  I sometimes get teased about that, you know.  I guess there's a reputation out there (laughs).
Story_ID: 24356
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, do you--now, when you think about your parents' personalities--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and their dispositions, their interests, their hobbies, their looks, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Ha-ha.  I think that I'm a lot like my mother [Della Mae McGraw] in terms of my personality and in terms of my disposition, and the way in which I go about things, the way in which I sort of embrace and reach toward family.  I think that probably my scientific inclinations are closer to that of my father [Jesse Francis Goodwin], and probably the way in which I study things, and the way in which I intellectually explore things might be a little more from him.  And, yeah, I think there's some aspects of both. In probably, though, in terms of just personality alone, I would say my mother.  I look at pictures of--I look at pictures of myself growing up, and she always had me kind of dressed in these kind of nice styles and things, and I still have that, that she gave me; sort of this sense of style.  We would spend a lot of time together.  We'd go to, you now, Fanny Farmer's, which, they had this maple walnut fudge that we would share.  Among the favorite colors my mother and I share, you know, yellows and oranges and all of those things.  We have a number of the same sensibilities about things.  So, I think in that sense there's definitely a lot with regards to my mother.
Story_ID: 24357
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, how many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: I have two brothers, a big brother and a little brother, essentially.  My older brother was born just eighteen months ahead of me, so he was born February 13th, 1962, and his name is Gordon Goodwin, Gordon Francis Goodwin; he's names after the Catholic priest.  And my younger brother was born December 19th, 1965, and his name is Jesse Stephen Goodwin-Asborn, and he's now Tyehimba Jess, and he is the poet that I referred to earlier that--
Speaker 1: I know him well.  Chicago.
Speaker 2: You do?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  We used to--he's a Facebook friend of mine.  I know Tyehimba's material.
Speaker 2: Oh, you're kidding me.  Now, you know a little bit about his family too (laughs).
Speaker 1: That's right.  That's right.
Speaker 2: Tyehimba Jess has the pen that my mother kept for so long from her father, and when you read the sort of thing--there are a couple of poems she saved that her father wrote, and, you know, he, you know, he wasn't a master poet, but there was something about the way he thought about and assessed things that is connected somehow.  And, certainly, as my mother said, when he got up to speak, he got up to speak.  And Tyehimba has that.  He has that when he does spoken word and he becomes, and he performs.  So, I think it's so interesting.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and in a sense of social justice too.
Speaker 2: Yes.  A very strong sense of social justice, which comes across as part of who he is.  So, Tyehimba Jess growing up was Stevie (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because we already had a Jesse, and, you know, so, we used the middle name, and then when he went to college, he began, you know, to think about and evolve his name.  He was going by Jess, and then he adopted Tyehimba Jess.  So that's exactly it.  He went to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], and my older brother went to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], and I went to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology].  So, we kind of--we grew up together, and we ended up in these different parts of the country.
Speaker 1: Well, okay.  Now, that's really something.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I know a clear picture of the family now (laughs).
Speaker 2: Yes.  Isn't that funny?  And Tyehimba Jess was the baby (laughs).  It's so interesting.
Story_ID: 24358
Speaker 1: So, now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: One of my earliest childhood memories actually is when my little brother came home from the hospital.  So, if we do the December of '65 [1965], and I was born in September of '63 [1963], I guess I was two years and three months old.  And my mother [Della Mae McGraw] and father [Jesse Francis Goodwin] came home--I remember--you know, I don't who opened the front door, but the front door opened; probably an aunt.  And my mother walks in with this white blanket and this tiny little brown baby, and he's like making movements, and I'm asking, "Why is he chewing gum?"  You know.  And it was just a fascinating, you know, this little being coming into our lives.  And I remember looking at my brother, and we're looking at each other, like, "Oh, there's someone else here."  It was just a--it was a good memory.  But it's one of my earliest ones is this concept of little brother.  I'm trying thing of anything earlier.  I think that probably that's right around the time memory hardens or begins to--
Speaker 1: Were you about three?
Speaker 2: I was two, two years old--two years and a couple of months, because Tyehimba's two years and three months younger than me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is 1965?
Speaker 2: It was 1965; December of 1965, and I was born in September of 1963.  And that memory--that I remember distinctly.  I remember that it was winter, I remember the coats, I remember that, you know, my brother and I--my older and I had been playing, and we had been called to the front door, and that the door opening; I do remember that.  That's very memorable.  If I try and I'll think of other early memories.  I remember being with--my older and I, when we were young, we had this, you know, we both had these Native American outfits that we got for Christmas, and we sort of played with that all day, and we had little horses.  My brother had a horse that rocks, and I had one that rolled.  And I remember trying to make my rolling horse rock like his, so I was banging it up against the basement.  I remember those things, and those were all around the same time.  I think, in fact, I was probably three at that point.  But, yeah, those are some of my earliest memories are of.  A lot of them are connected with my brothers, you know; playing with my older brother, my baby brother, and sitting in the house in the living room and dining room, certain foods that I remember to a large extent, you know.  Definitely, those are my earliest memories.
Story_ID: 24359
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was the name of your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: So, I lived in the northwest part of Detroit [Michigan], and literally, I lived in Apline Street (ph. splg.), near the corner of--Apline Street on the corner of Cambridge.  So, Seven Mile and Myers (ph. splg.) was the intersection that we were closest to.  And we were--our neighborhood was called the "Seven Shaeffer (ph. splg.) Greenfield; it was near Seven Mile Shaeffer and Greenfield.  And, I guess, the black clubs and so forth used those as reference points.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was about a mile away from--we were about a mile or so away from the suburbs.  So, if you went up a little bit further down Myers, you'd hit Eight Mile, and on the other side of the street was Oak Park, and if you went up a little bit further then you'd hit Southfield [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I was not very far from Northland, which was one of the early malls that developed in Detroit.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  I've seen that.  That's near Outer Drive or something like that?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We lived right off of Outer Drive.  You know how it curves a few times.  It curves right into Apline Street, and we were a block from where it hit Apline Street.
Speaker 1: Now, we always ask this question--now, well, describe the house you grew up in.  What was it like?
Speaker 2: It's actually a two-story house with a finished basement.  And, it's essentially a brick house with shutters, painted shutters and a backyard with a white picket fence, and a garage in the back; essentially a one-car garage in the back.  So, our house had a, you know, the kitchen and dining area all on one floor; kitchen, dining, and living.  And it was--I think the house may have been built in the '20s [1920s] or '30 [1930s], so these were separate rooms.  They were defined separate rooms, but they had archways through which you would connect.  And we also had a, what we called, the porch.  It was a porch, but it had been modified by the previous owners to contain the porch.  So it was actually an additional room that my father turned into his office area or his workroom.  It had a little heater, it had paneling.  Then up the stairs, we had the master bedroom, two bedrooms; the boys' room and the girl's room, and a bathroom.  And in the basement we had, you know, carpeted stairs and railing, and then we had--when I was growing up it was fully carpeted, but as I got older it became a fully carpeted area--was essentially the equivalent of probably like a rec room [recreation room] or something.  There is a bar in the back, again, from the previous owners, and it was converted into kind of like a storage area.  There was actually a low-hanging black kind of ridge along the more open area where we had the TV set.  That's where our first color TV set went.  And, it had couches and La-Z-boy, and then a more open area before that where you enter.  And we had sort of a desk area there as well.  Bookcases everywhere.  There we--we had bookcases with doors that hid books and bookcases with more books.  Even now there are a large number of books there.  My mother is in the house, living in the house now.  There were books about every step along the way in African-American history.  There are books, you know, that are about medical history, but also about political history; three different versions of the encyclopedia (laughs), at any given time; many, many journals; photographic essays from Gordon Parks; medical health journals; lots of books.  It didn't look--they were all placed very nicely in shelves, but there were--instead of having empty bookshelves, we had full bookshelves.  And then the porch, the office area where my father was, he had all of the journals, his journals.  The style of the house was, growing up as a small child, was classic 1960s, Danish-style furniture with kind of like the geometric shape and the kind of Mod [modern], you know, with the Mod colors, you know, sort of like there is kind of a--a kind of orange and a kind green, olive color that was hip then, and nubby tweed kind of.  It was very, kind of hip, recognizing that, as an older person looking back on it, we had a drop down lamp in the basement that had this ball with, you know, the frosted lime glass, and my mother always put an orange light bulb in, so it had kind of this Mod glow.  Yeah, it was a very kind of hipply (ph. splg.) furnished place.  And then as we got older, my mother transformed it a couple of times.  So, you know, updated it so it always looked elegant.  And we always felt like, you know, my mother had maintained this really beautiful home.  And to this day, you can go in there and say, "Oh, yes, it's very nice."  She keeps things for a very long time.  So, when she updates, she moves in some new things, but she keeps the old things.  So some of that hip furniture is recovered, but it's still there, it's just in a different place, and now it looks hip again, it's in, you know, (Madmen's?) style furniture.  She has a table, the kitchen table, that she got with--she purchased with my aunt Gladys in the 1950s, and she has the receipt from when she purchased it.  It's a solid maple table with pullout leaves.  And that and the chairs--my parents, they took care of their stuff, so everything is in very good condition.  My mother monitored and kept everything and kept track of it.  We had a stereo, which was long, beautiful with the sliding doors, and you uncover the record player, it comes out in it.  You know, it was just a very, very nice set of furniture.
Speaker 1: It's called a stereo--I mean a console stereo?
Speaker 2: Console stereo.  About the length--half the length of a room or so, and yeah, you had the records that were stored in the cabinetry, this fine wood with, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Very, very nice set up.  I can't remember the name, but it's a well-known name.  My brother would know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Absolutely.
Story_ID: 24360
Speaker 1: Now, we always ask this question in this way:  What were some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, wow.  Sights included big snows, because in Detroit, we--more then than now, we got these big snows.  Sights, like seeing snow higher than my little brother.  I remember walking home and worrying about him getting, like, buried in one of those drifts.  The three of us, in so many different settings, because we traveled a lot growing up, in the summertime we would go on these family trips.  They were usually, I found out later, often connected with where the American Chemical Society meeting was or the Analytical Chemists Society.  So, if it happened that it was in San Francisco [California], road trip through the Grand Canyon to San Francisco, for example.  And my father [Jesse Francis Goodwin] liked to drive.  Honestly and truly liked to drive.  So, even as planes became more common, of course, they were expensive, but I think my father also had a thing about liking to drive.  So, we would get in the car.  So, one of the scenes growing up is being in the back seat of the car with my two brothers, and I'd have the middle seat, and playing games to entertain each other, and asking are we there yet, and identifying the McDonald's rings, you know, and Howard Johnson's orange roofs, and sort of spending the night at these places along the way; seeing the Grand Canyon, seeing Yellowstone park, going to, you know, all of these different landmark amusement parks in different locations.  So, a lot of travel in the summer.  Going to my grandmother's.  Definitely, fried chicken, my grandmother; lots of food and, you know, hanging out with cousins.  Growing up in Detroit [Michigan] was definitely music in the background.  There were songs--I'm like my, in particular, my older brother who remembered every artist for every song all the time.  I didn't always know who the artists were, but I'd recognize the song right away.  So, growing up in Detroit, it's almost like there's a soundtrack to that (laughs), because there was always music in the background.  We were always were listening to WDRQ or one of the other major stations.  And, as the music changed, Detroit was very engaged in the music industry, so you were hearing a lot about it.  The style of Detroit, I think, I did sort of experience a kind of golden age for Detroit. So, going to Livernois, and it being sort of a place where there's high fashion in the streets, and people walking up and down getting, you know, these nice purchases from these nice stores off of Livernois; being sort of engaged in a community where you would up and down the street, and you'd see a number of other people walking up and down the street.  So, I definitely remember all of that.
Speaker 1: So, this is almost when Detroit had almost like full employment.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Exactly.  Our neighbors on the left, right, and in front of us were all working for oil companies, and were all very--doing very well.  And so, they all were providing very nice lives for their children.  You know, you would go up and down the street and kids would have these really nice bikes and these new toys, and it was, you know, people were doing well and you could tell that.
Speaker 1: Now, when you mentioned Greenfield, I thought of Greenfield Village, and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah (laughs).
Speaker 1: And, you know, a lot of people I know would go to Detroit just to go to Greenfield Village.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: It represented, you know, a future.  You know, this future of technology and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: That's right.  We went there several times.  So, I definitely know Greenfield Village.  We go to the--there's a part of Greenfield Village where you go back in time, and you know, back in the Edison [Thomas Edison] days, and then they take you through this journey of inventions, and you see what all the new gadgets are, what all the cool things, and I loved that.  Also, the Detroit Science Museum, all of these places I have strong memories of.  The library.  I loved to go to the library.  And we went there frequently.  I had a huge capacity for reading when I was growing up.  I read more than I played outside.  So, the books theme for me was big.  I was--my mother would take us to the children's section, and I'd just dive into it.  But the library itself was gorgeous.  When you walked into the public library, there were beautiful murals on the wall and ceiling.  It felt like you were entering a grand place.  And, we'd spend a lot of time in the Art Center in Detroit.  We took piano lessons around there.  We went to the museums frequently.  So a lot of time was spent there.  So, sights and sounds, definitely those qualify.  And then as I got older, a lot of the neighborhoods scenes, because we were playing out in the street with neighbors as we were growing up.  We began to get friends outside of our neighborhood and hang out in other places.  But the Renaissance Center was an area where people would congregate, and during the summer we had these international festivals; a different international theme each Saturday and Sunday, and you would go there and hang out and see if you recognized people there.  Yeah, and that was also very nice.  They'd be local dancers and music, and all of that.
Speaker 1: Now, this is in the plaza out there--
Speaker 2: That's right.  In the Hart Plaza.
Speaker 1: Hart Plaza.
Speaker 2: In the Hart Plaza near Joe Louis Arena (laughs).  Exactly.  And at this time, all of those things were just being introduced, just brand-new.  So, when the festivals were introduced, they brought huge throngs of people there every weekend.  And if it were a Mexican theme, you'd have Mexican food and dancing and all this.  You know, each time it would be something different.
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 24361
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a favorite Motown musician?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.
Speaker 1: Or group?
Speaker 2: (laughs).  I didn't have a favorite for two reasons:  One, my brother at that time was one who had the memory and knew who was singing what, and I tended to experience music without controlling it.  I don't know how that was, but things would be around me, but I wouldn't be the one putting the record on.  So, I didn't really know until I got older who some of the artists really were.  So, in Motown artists, as an adult I can look back and there are people I really like, like Marvin Gaye, you know.  But, and Gladys Knight, and you know, there may be a few others that are,'t popping up right now, but when I was growing up, it was really, well, I experienced music to a large extent from my brothers and from family members.  So, I didn't really know where--from whence it came, just that, you know, I really like this song.  Now, of course, the Jackson Five, that's a different thing (laughs).  Everybody knew about the Jackson Five.  And, you know, I like the Jackson Five, and at the time that I began to be old enough to manipulate my own music--
Speaker 1: So you were about nine when the Jackson Five--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Nine or ten.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, around the same age--two years younger than Michael.  Two years younger than Michael [Michael Jackson].  So, that's about right.  And, around the time that I was old enough to sort of select and choose music, you know, funk had come about.  I think the first record I bought is not a high-end piece of music at all.  I think it was like, "Bootsy's Rubber Band" or something like this, you know.  At that time, it was more about having fun with music and, you know, "Flashlight," Ohio Players, you know.  Those were the people that I began to become more familiar with, because I was--I was at an age where I was selecting music myself and buying music myself.
Story_ID: 24362
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, where did you start school?
Speaker 2: Oh, I started school--I actually went to a preschool at a nondenominational church and then started kindergarten.  I went to kindergarten in a public school nearby, which was called McDowell, but after that first year, I was entered into Presentation Our Lady of Victory School.  It was just three blocks from where we lived, and as I mentioned, my father's Catholic, and so, when my mother got married to him, she also became Catholic, so, we were raised Catholic.  And, from first grade through to twelfth grade I was in Catholic schools.  From first through eighth grade I was at Presentation Our Lady of Victory, and I walked to school.  And, for high school, I actually went to Academy of the Sacred Heart in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.  And that required a fairly long commute.  So, I would either get driven by my mother or I would take a shuttle that they had set up to get there.
Speaker 1: How far was Bloomfield Hills from--?
Speaker 2: It was--it's roughly a thirty five to forty minute car drive.  It's about, in miles, Bloomfield Hills is closer to the fifteen to sixteen mile line, and we're at seven miles, so there's at least eight, and then you have to--I forget whether you go east or west, but I would say it's probably something like twelve to thirteen miles away from where we lived in Detroit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Absolutely way out in the suburbs, very different setting.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, you just went to public school that one year (unclear) kindergarten?
Speaker 2: That's right.  I went to McDowell for kindergarten.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I went to Presentation Our Lady of Victory.  It was originally Presentation, was one parish.  Our Lady of Victory was the other and they joined them.  And there was a school that Presentation ran.  It was actually run by the Oblate Sisters.  I don't know if you've heard of that order of nuns, but they're the all-black order of nuns.
Speaker 1: (unclear) appointed in Baltimore, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's right.  Oh, yeah.  We had, you know, our sisters were pretty sisters (laughs).  They were real disciplinarians, so, you know, we had uniforms, rules, and at that time, corporal punishment was still, you know, kind of in, so they used the pointer, you know, against the hand, you know, as punishment.  Yeah, and basically, my experience at Presentation was first through sixth grade.  And I skipped seventh grade and finished with eighth grade there.  It was a great education in terms of the commitment that the teachers had to teaching the students.  They definitely encouraged us to learn, and I really loved school.  I really took to--I really loved the school components of school.  I took to the classroom.  I liked engaging with the teachers, and I liked the homework, and I liked, you know, the pencils and the paper and all that.  But I was a very--I was not a very socially-engaged person at that time.  I had one best friend from first through eighth grade (laughs), and then in high school, I maybe opened up a little bit more.  Yeah.  But the Catholic school experience was a good one.  And then, when it was time to go to high school, I was a year younger than everyone else because I had skipped that seventh grade.  My mother was especially concerned about my going to a school where I would feel comfortable and excel.  On the other hand, a number of schools had a slightly different level of math that they had been teaching, because a lot of these kids had been going to schools in their local areas.  So, I remember that I applied to several schools, and my Detroit options would have been Cass Tech [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan].  There was also a Mercy High School in Detroit.  There was the Academy of the Sacred Heart.  And there was the Cranbrook Institute, right, and--
Speaker 1: Now, that's outside of town too.
Speaker 2: That's outside of town too.  It turns out that it's only a couple of miles from the Academy of the Sacred Heart, and we played them in field hockey and a few other things.  It what--used to be all boys, but it became boys and girls around the time I was in high school.  So, yeah.  That one is--that's quite far out.  You can go to the Cranbrook institute and we did camp there a few times, and did their science, you know, classes and things like that.  But, Sacred Heart ended up being the best fir for me, and it's a very small school.  It had--my class had twenty students in it, entering, and we were the biggest class for a while.  Most of the classes were about twenty to thirty students.
Speaker 1: How many black students out of the total?
Speaker 2: Oh, wow.  Not a lot.  In my class of forty, I believe there were four of us.  So that's--I mean--
Speaker 1: Ten percent or--
Speaker 2: It's about ten percent.  And, I think, in the class ahead of me, maybe a little bit smaller, varied from class to class.  There were enough black students there that we, you know, we knew and recognized and commune with each other.  But we were definitely--it was clear that we were in the minority in that sense.  And, at that time, in those times, you know, there was--people were fairly opened about the fact that they didn't know very much about black people, so, when you would get to know people, they would ask about, you know, what about your hair, and how do you do that, and how do you do this.  So, it was, you know, an interesting experience because all of my previous educational experience was in what had become an all-black setting.  When my mother [Della Mae McGraw] and father [Jesse Francis Goodwin] moved to Detroit [Michigan], the neighborhood they moved into was all white and primarily Jewish in 1961 or when they made the purchase, my mother was pregnant with Gordon, and they were actually attempts to--the neighbors pulled together and tried to buy the house out from under them, but the attempt, it wasn't successful.  But, during that first to five years that we were there, our neighborhood went from all white to sort of a mixed group to completely black.  By the time I was starting at Presentation, there were very few, you know, whites still in the neighborhood by the time I was six or seven.  So, I grew up, a lot of my childhood  surrounded primarily with other black children; and then, at Sacred Heart, so this sort of inverted the ratio.  So, it was an interesting experience.  You know, it was something I adapted to very well.  But it definitely introduces you to different ways in which people view and perceive things, and how you handle it, and when do you get bothered, and when do you not get bothered and, you know, it's an interesting experience.  My own group of friends ended up looking like a little U.N.  I had Mary Margaret O'Neill who, despite her name, was a very tall, dark-skinned, afroed black woman, who was named after a Saint and, you know, adopted.  And Margarita Gomez, who was Filipino, and her father worked at a medical facility.  I had an Italian friend, then Maria O'Shreve, who was black; and we might call it Creole, you know, a little bit.  We had, like, a fairly broad mix of people in my set of friends.  But, in general, Sacred Heart was, yeah, didn't have a large amount of diversity, you know, in terms of blacks.
Story_ID: 24363
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you look back at your whole school experience, even going back to grade school, who were some of the teachers--were there any special teachers or mentors along the way that you remember?
Speaker 2: Yes.  So, in grade school, I remember a couple of teachers.  Mrs. McCray (ph. splg.) in fourth grade, who was just incredibly encouraging and, you know, Mrs. King in sixth grade, who was a hard-liner for writing in English, but taught me how to write well.  And even some of my, you know, there's a Sister Cornelius in my early grades who was very strict, but I think taught discipline.  When I got to high school, one of the most memorable teachers was my chemistry teacher.  I took chemistry junior year, and by this time I had decided I was going to be a writer of children's fiction.  And, you know, I was still doing well in chemistry, and physics, and so forth, and she noticed that I was really interested in the chemistry lab section and started to me and told me that I really should think about chemical engineering as a field.  So that was--that was the first time I had actually heard of chemical engineering.  And I started to look a little bit further into it, and she gave me some background material and so forth.  Yeah.  And so, that actually was a turning point for me, because I began to think seriously about a science and math based career versus something that might be more of a writing or a literary career.  So, that was a pretty significant influence.
Story_ID: 24364
Speaker 1: Now, you were really, from what I've read, you really wanted to be a writer.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.  I had been spending a lot of my time reading books, and I had--I'd been writing little essays and things on the side.  And, you know, I entered a contest that NAACP had set up and had won, like, maybe a second place for writing.  So, I was thinking about writing seriously, all the way up until chemistry, until chemistry class.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And then I thought, you know, the ability to put two things together and create something entirely new, that's pretty compelling; color changing, heat generating reaction.  And I began to get much more interested in the science world right around that point.
Speaker 1: So, this is in high school.
Speaker 2: That's right.  It's right in the middle of high school, the beginning of junior year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Did you have any--now, I know Detroit had a pretty strong poetry tradition, I guess, in those days with, like, Dudley Randall, Broadside Press; Naomi Long Madgett--all the people that associated with--Gloria House--a bunch of people that were poets.  Did you know any of those writers?
Speaker 2: I was not aware of those writers.  I think now when I talk to my younger brother [Tyehimba Hess], he knows and can make connection to who those people are and what their--how their tradition impacted his tradition, you know, how the poetry and literary traditions have been passed on in Detroit [Michigan] and Chicago [Illinois]; that whole area.  I knew nothing of it at that time in 1976 to 1980 when all this was going on.  I didn't know about the more detail and sophisticated side of Detroit in terms of poetry.  In fact, I wasn't even aware that there were famous, you now, black poets coming from Detroit at that time.  I think I was much more aware of some of the writers I had more access to in a traditional library setting.  So, that was actually something I learned from my brother years later, years later.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have go to Von's Bookstore in Detroit?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, although, again, as an older--as an adult as opposed to a young person.  It's fascinating.  It's fascinating.  But at that time, yeah, I didn't--I wasn't as aware of those things.  It's also interesting because right around the time I became a teenager, Detroit became a different kind of place to navigate.  So instead of just sort of walking opening down Livernois, you started walking with a little bit of a bracing, you know, an awareness of your boundaries and other people's boundaries, because our crime had increased significantly and, you know, our neighborhoods had begun to change.  So this is as the '70s [1970s] moved toward the '80s[1980s], right, and we are in the late''70s [1970s].  So I didn't because I hadn't learned how to drive yet, I didn't have my own means of transportation, and I only felt comfortable taking the bus to about two places, you know.  And the nearby district library section in Northland.  And beyond that, I had a large sense of discomfort about navigating Detroit, in part, because I was young, teenaged, girl, and I am sure my parents were making sure I wasn't just going to, you know--.  They were very protective of how and where I went and so forth; but also because there was some sort of clear shift in going even just to the drugstore to get candy at the corner store, you know--people--you feel a little bit more accosted.  People would say stuff to you and try and instigate stuff with you.  Just walking from my house to my best friend's house, you know, guys would start saying stuff, and so, I began to get, you know, I began to shift in my mobility in Detroit in those last years as a teenager, and my role became fairly well defined by the places that I could be driven to, and that probably limited my ability to visit a place like the Von's Bookstore or any of the other places that other people knew a lot about.
Speaker 1: Especially by yourself, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.
Story_ID: 24365
Speaker 1: You know, George Mathis really talked about the gang situation in Detroit at a certain (unclear).
Speaker 2: It really grew.  And in our neighborhood there was a Northwest Side, there was a gang associated with that, and graffiti started showing up on the street corners and things, and yeah, things did change.  And you couldn't just sort of walk to the corner, which is seven miles for us, and buy something and not sort of be looking and holding, you know.  I had so many instructions on how to hold my money, how to hold my purse, and my bag, and my keys, and the--you know, the defensive things with the keys and the--yeah.  I had a lot of training in that (laughs), because you had to be a little bit more on defense around that time.
Story_ID: 24366
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, when you were in high school then, when you were, you know, thinking about graduation, were you--had you decided what college you were going to go to?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  When I began thinking about graduation, having decided I wanted to do chemical engineering, I looked at where there were strong engineering programs.  And MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology]came up as being the best place, you know, in the world to go for engineering in general.  So, it was always on my mind that I would love to get into MIT.  I also was interested in a few other colleges, so I applied to, I think, Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] , Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], and Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan], of course.  And I can't remember if I even applied to a California school, but it was primarily Michigan and then a few of the other schools in the East and Mid-Atlantic corridor.  And, when I went out to visit MIT, I got on MIT's campus, and I thought, "Oh, yeah.  This works for me.  I really like this place."  There was something about MIT, the campus, and the people as I moved about that really felt like this was the right fit.  You know, there was this sense of being heavily into something, which is the way I was most of my life.  If I wasn't intensely into books, I was intensely into science; was perfectly and completely normal.  And the whole idea of caring more about that stuff than anything else, how you're presenting yourself socially, how you're engaging, gave you the sense of comfort, you know.  I think, as I mentioned, in a lot of my school days, I was pretty contained and shy.  I mean, I didn't want to, you know, I wasn't someone who sort of blended in easily in social groups.  So this was actually perfect because there were no real social rules.  It was just, you know, go in and just talk about your stuff and, you know, get engaged.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, when you graduated from Sacred Heart, did you graduate with any particular honors or anything?
Speaker 2: I was the--so, the valedictorian was Bonita, I was the salutatorian or the runner-up, the next thing.  Our class was so small, though, that we only had a recognition for the valedictorian, because if you can imagine if you have, like--if you have thirty or forty people, it's--so, I think I got--I can't remember doing anything special with regard to that.  But I do remember that I was sort of the next, the one right after that, Bonita Almeda, and then myself.
Story_ID: 24367
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well, MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology].  This is 19--?
Speaker 2: Eighty.
Speaker 1: Eighty.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: 1980.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: This is the year that Jimmy Carter is elected--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --president, and--no.  .
Speaker 2: That Ronald Reagan is elected president.
Speaker 1: Ronald--that's right.  That's right.
Speaker 2: And Jimmy Carter lost, and I was too young to vote.  It was very frustrating actually.  I remember.
Speaker 1: I had to catch myself on that.
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  I should have caught it too.  That's right. INTERVIEWER  So, okay.  So, MIT.  So, what was MIT like in 1980?
Speaker 1: In 1980, I went from going from Academy of the Sacred Heart where I had this United Nations sort of group of friends to going to MIT, which was a situation where I was thrilled by the setting, the science and technology setting, but fairly intimidated by my peers who were coming from much more expensive grounds than Catholics in science. MIT, itself, was an exciting place.  It was filled with people who were just fascinatingly smart and doing incredible things.  There's the sense that you could pick up and do anything you wanted if you'd just connected with other people.  Coming in as a freshman, though, I was wary of, you know, I was scared of failing.  I wanted to make sure I was going to be able to be there the next year.  So, for me, I hadn't taken calculus before, and I was the only one I knew who hadn't.  And so, that was one of the big deals for me, was just can I, you know, calculus is hard, what if I don't do well in it.  I hadn't had the level of physics that other people had had.  So, for me entering at that time, I was looking for people that I sort of communicate with and be comfortable with.  And, the black community was very strong at MIT.  As soon as I got on campus, there were black students were already communicating and, you know, reaching out and introducing themselves.  So I would say we had this, we called "Rush Week" or "RO week," "Resident's Orientation Week," during which you choose the dorm you're going to live with.  And within that week's time, I had, you know, sort lifelong friends.  It just automatically--in that kind of setting you make these hard and fast friends.  I had my freshman year roommates.  I had, you know, the friends that I was going to, you know, work with on physics and all of that before we even started classes.  So, I was very much a part the black student community at MIT.  I was a member of the Black Student Union, the National Society of Black Engineers; the--I pledged Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Incorporated] in my sophomore year, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority; I helped organize a major Black Science and Technology Conference with some of my other friends.  And, yeah, I felt very connected to MIT as a place, but I also, at that time, needed to connect with my black community, it's sort of you're at different points in your life where you are focused on different aspects of yourself and your growth, and in this case, this was the community that sort of helped boost me and keep me going while I was at MIT.  So, as an undergraduate, I found that a large amount of my support came from this group of students.  And that enabled me to, as I got to be a junior and a senior, feel confident about myself enough to reach out to other faculty members and begin to try other things to do, and undergraduate research projects, and to think more broadly about MIT and the opportunities that I had there.  So, it was actually an interesting experience, but it was in contrast to my high school experience while I was reaching out and getting to know people from a vast range of background.  Right?
Speaker 2: It was also the aspect that you could go from an all-female school--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --to MIT, which I assume was male dominated.
Speaker 1: Yes.  It was 17 percent women (laughs).  So that all of these differences were huge: the size of the place, the male-female ratio, the fact that there were men there at all.  And so, I went to--I went to the all-women's dorm, and I stayed there for all four years (laughs).  And that sort of felt much more comfortable with that setting.  But, yes, everything was different; every single thing was different.  So it was--I loved the experience.  It was intense.  It was always intense.  There was not a kind of--MIT isn't where you go for the quiet moment, at least not for the most part of it.  It's where you go to get completely and totally immersed in the thing you're into, and it's where you're going to see things you've never thought of.  So, I was always sort of, you know, engaged.  Work at MIT is intense, and that's true now; it was true then.  So, I was a fairly disciplined person and that helped me.  But, I had never seen workloads like what I had experience, you know, when I first started at MIT.  The management of the problem set that's due here versus the one that's due there, and managing your time, and splitting your night up into, "First I'm going to work three hours on this one, and then I'm going to work four hours on that one."  It was--it required getting your act together if you didn't have it together, and really exercising the skills that you did have.  So, I also learned how to manage things, you know, in terms of my own self-organization then.
Story_ID: 24368
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who were some of the role models and mentors here, you know, for you?
Speaker 2: Okay.  So in my undergraduate years, I sort of had two MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] experiences.  And in my undergraduate years, my mentors, the adults who were mentors to me included Clarence Williams, who was heading the Office of Minority Education at the time and was always reaching out and available, was quiet and thoughtful, and encouraging always.  And, I've known him for a long time since, and he has always held that role at MIT.  I was inspired by two young black professors who were there at the time: Jim Gates and Jim Hubbard (ph. splg.).  And there was also.  And there was also Jim Williams.  I hadn't thought about the Jim thing, but Jim Williams, who was a senior--
Speaker 1: The Jims (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I know.  I hadn't even--until I said it just now, it had not occurred to me.  I guess we were saying Professor Hubbard and Professor Gates.  Jim Gates went on to become an incredibly, wildly successful physicist at the University of Maryland, because when he--he actually was in his early years at MIT, and I may not get this correct, but he had some concerns that he brought to his department chair, and at that time, you know, regarding things that he needed to succeed, and they couldn't offer him the setting that he needed, and Maryland could.  So, he ended up going to Maryland and becoming wildly successful.  You know, at that time, they would come to our tutoring period.  We had this tutorial set up by the Black Student Union where you could go over some of the basic classes with people we offered to be tutors, and they offered their time.  And just seeing, "Oh, there's a black professor," that helped a lot, just knowing that they were there, and that they were smart and that they could explain something competently, sort of reinforced the idea that if they can explain, you know, this concept of quantum mechanics, then I can get it.  At that time, MIT was experimenting with introducing quantum physics in their intro to physics class that has since--that was since eliminated about four or five years later.  But we had a little book on quantum physics, which now I come to think that this is--it's kind of mind-blowing for a freshman.  But it was exciting.  Those people I think of immediately.  There were also faculty members who were things that interested me and were very encouraging.  One of them was Ed  Merrill, who's retired now.  He actually taught polymer science and Engineering.  And Bob Cohen, who also in the polymer science field, and I took their classes as electives.  It interested me then, and they were very memorable, both of them, and their teaching style and in their personalities.  They were very, very approachable people.  So, they ended up being mentors of a different sort, and they ended up playing a role in my life later on.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 24369
Speaker 1: Well, okay.  All right.  So, at the end of--so you finished MIT in '84 [1984]?
Speaker 2: I finished MIT [Massachusetts Institute or Technology] in 1984, and that's right.  I went on to--at that time, I had met John Hammond, and he and I married in 1985.  So, John was a mechanical engineering student, and essentially, I had been thinking about graduate school, but hadn't hardened on the idea.  It was a thought, but not something I was fully committed to.  And we both got very nice offers in process engineering.
Story_ID: 24370
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in 1984, I guess this is--is this before graduation you worked for Motorola?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was right after graduation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I got my bachelor's degree in chemical engineering and both me and, at the time, my fiance, John Hammond, got process engineering offers to work in the communications sector at Motorola in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, as engineers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you both went to--
Speaker 2: We both went to Motorola.  We both started there, and that was my first full time experience working in industry.  And we worked there for two years.  During that time, I definitely got exposed a range of work attitudes, which included my division, which was called Micro, had a very strong opinion about women engineers and a fairly--a very poorly hidden idea about black engineers, you know.  So, I think, my experience there was, you know, I joined a group in which some of the people were good colleagues who were trying to reach out, but there were people present who liked to make jokes about women engineers.  The whole group, I think they felt it was sort of hippishly (sic) funny to joke about how long I would last as a woman engineer, because the last couple of them had left after two years or one year.  There were two present at the time I joined who were new, and they both left within a year.  So, they were saying "Micro's a tough environment.  You have to be really tough to work in Micro."  It's where we encapsulate and fabricate the devices from integrated circuits.  So we actually take the integrated circuit, package it into its final package, which is a IC chip, and you have to have a very high yield in that process because the chips themselves are very expensive.  Well, it was interesting because that was one of the things.  The other one, as I said, there was another black engineer in my group and, you know, we did fine, but there were these--first of all, Florida is an interesting place.  Fort Lauderdale in the '80s [1980s] was a place where, after being in Detroit and even Boston, I felt like I was a community that was much quieter about who African-Americans were in the community.  They didn't feel like there was a presence, an African-American presence that was a positive one.  In fact, we used to joke about the fact that we couldn't find any sign of where or if there were ever a NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Chapter in this area, that there were a lot of blacks living on the edge.  So it had this very--what I wasn't used to--which was this very clear division, not only between black and white, but with poverty versus, you know, the haves and have-nots.  And in the factory, everyone in the factory who wasn't a supervisor was either black or Hispanic.  So, and they were all female in Micro because there's something about, you know, the ability to assemble these tiny little parts, wire bonders that look like knitting machines.  So, I would walk around--you have to wear a bunny suit, you know.  I would walk around and be mistaken for a factory worker all the time.  And there were always these sort of--there were odd comments.  And, I'm not a very sensitive person because I've gone through experiences in life where I kind of know when someone's just being curious, or just being open, or just expressing their opinion, or when someone is trying to prod you.  And they were situations where, you know, there was clearly some attempt to prod.  So, it was an interesting experience.  After two years, I got promoted once and decided this was it, and there's no way, you know, either of us were sort going to commit a career to that.  And we had already been thinking about the next step in education anyway.  My husband had a much worst time than I did.  I did reasonably well.  I mean, I did okay.  But his boss was very, you know, confrontational.  So it was not a good experience.  And as a black man, I think he experienced a bit more push from others.  I remember he came to join us for lunch, and my group was going to lunch and they saw him and they said, "Come and join us, John, and let's see how much a black man can drink," you know.  And that was, like, an example.  It's one I remember, but there were several of those little things that they thought were funny, that suggested to me that they were isolated from the concept of, you know, an integrated society.  So, it was just a strange situation.
Story_ID: 24371
Speaker 1: My husband got accepted to Emory Business School [Goizueta Business School, Emory University, Atlanta Georgia], and I got a job at Georgia Tech Research Institute [Georgia Institute Technology].  And so, this is, you know, we used that as an opportunity to move to Atlanta [Georgia].  So, this was my husband at the time.  We did eventually divorce when I went to--when I finished my Ph.D., and that's why you see my name with many different versions as you would go through my life.  But at this time, in Atlanta, I got back to working in a real research environment, and that was the driver for me.  When I was working at Motorola, aside from the work attitudes which I could deal with, I could filter fairly well on a day-to-day basis.  I wasn't able to work on problems that actually impacted long term--the final goal.  And I like problem-oriented sort of challenges.  So, going back to Georgia Tech Research Institute, I was actually able to work on research, understand and study phenomenon in a way that would actually lead to the development of something that does something.  And, I actually was working on contract research.  I had a wonderful boss who actually was from Arkansas, John Gooch (ph. splg.), a southern white man, incredibly polite, wonderful, delightful person, older, polymer scientist; and he just sort of took me under my wing, and then we became partners.  I was his one--I was one of his two major employees, and we worked on these projects together.  We devised what we were going to do and how we were going to approach it.  And, I developed a master's thesis by going to Georgia Tech while I was working, and GTRI [Georgia Tech Research Institute] would pay for that.  And, my thesis project was co-advised by someone at Georgia Tech, Abi Abbi Ramen (ph. splg.) and my boss.  So I got in a master's degree and a research work experience at the same time that my husband was getting his MBA [Master's of Business Administration] at Emory [Emory University].  So that worked out extremely well, and also, allowed me to realize that I really wanted to stay in the research environment.  And, in fact, when I got back on Georgia Tech's campus, I was so happy to be back in an academic setting.  I realized that I wanted to stay in an academic setting.  So, at that point, I decided I wanted to go into academia.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, I was wondering, because when you left MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], you weren't really thinking about pursuing Ph.D.'s?
Speaker 1: I was thinking about it, but I wasn't sure about it.  And so, I entered MIT at sixteen and graduated at twenty.  And, I think, still trying to figure out whether--how these pieces fit together.  I was interested in polymer science, but I couldn't quite picture myself in grad school at the time.  But after the two years working at Motorola, landing back on Georgia Tech's campus, I realized, "Okay," now, this is again, like I did when I hit MIT, I thought, "This is it."  I want to be in a campus environment, I want to do basic or applied research, I want to be able to examine problems from this kind of perspective, and I want to be able to choose my own problems.  And all of those things sort of came together at Georgia Tech.
Story_ID: 24372
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  All right.  So, you finished your master's degree in '88 [1988].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then you went on to--now, did you work after that or did you go on to MIT?
Speaker 2: Oh, I went on to MIT.  After '88 [1988], I finished my master's degree, but I had applied to the Ph.D. program at MIT that had just been introduced a couple of years called, "The Program in Polymer Science and Technology."  It allowed you to do a Ph.D. associated with your host department, which for me is chemical engineering.  But, your primary classes would be in polymer science, and your secondary classes are your electives, would be in chemical engineering.  That was perfect for me, because I had spent two years doing a master's program in chemical engineering and really was looking forward to being able to spend all of my time studying polymer science as opposed to doing, yet, a third or fourth chemical engineering thermodynamics class.  So, this allowed me to make the polymer science the core of my learning experience when I came back.  The person who founded the program was Bob Cohen, the person I mentioned earlier, was one of two faculty that I looked up to, that I was interested in, in terms of both his teaching style and his area of work.  And Ed Merrill was one of the primary teachers in the class and he was the other.  So, I ended up taking classes taught by Ed Merrill and Bob Cohen as a graduate student, along with several other faculty here on campus who were involved in polymer science and technology, and really immersing.  This Ph.D. program was a very different experience from undergraduate because, now, I was coming back with this huge sense of excitement at being a full-time student.  The value of not having anything to do but be a student was something that I hadn't appreciated as an undergraduate.  But having worked and come back, I was 100 percent there.  And, the ability to actually choose my problems, and you get to choose or select your advisor and your project, those were incredibly exciting to me.  So, I was very happy arriving on campus.  And my experience was different because in this case, my community, my set of friends that I immediately bonded with were my fellow first-year graduate students in the program.  And, once again, we were--we looked like a little United Nations, and we formed friendships which exist to this day.  There are six of us in this particular program; four of us are faculty, and one of them is across the river at BU, and we still talk to each other, you know.  We talk about writing proposals together.  So, I formed these really close friendships during my graduate year that I think were unique and were really based on our mutual interest in science that led to everything else that friends share.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now--I'm kind of confused from the outline here that I have.  Now, you did a post--well, before do post-doc--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --let's--did you finish your Ph.D. work before '93 [1993]?
Speaker 2: I finished it in June of '93 [1993].  June of 1993.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, tell us what your dissertation was about?
Speaker 2: So, my dissertation was about the development of what we call thermochromic materials.  They were materials that changed colors when you heat them.  And mechanochromic materials.  These are materials that change color when you stretch them.  So, in my Ph.D. work I actually chose to work with Michael Rubner (ph. splg.), and he is an organic chemist--physical organic chemist in the materials, science and engineering department.  At the time, he was designing materials that contain a chemical group in them, that when you irradiate it with light, formed a polymer chain that absorbs light at a very specific wave length.  And so, it appears to be a very specific color.  If you incorporate that into a stretchy polymer like a polyurethane in the proper way, then when you stretch it, you disrupt the way in which the polymer arranges itself, and it absorbs that at a different wave length.  So, basically, I had these polyurethanes, which are rubbery, stretchy materials, and you would stretch them and they'd be deep purple, and they'd turn red, and then orange, and then yellow; and then you release them, and then they'd go back to blue again as a function of strain.  The same with temperature.  I developed these polyesters, which are kind of, like, you know, the shrink wrap films.  And you'd heat them, they'd be deep purple, and they go through this color change; and then as you coat them they'd go back down.  You could actually make imprints in a certain color, and you could lock in the color.  So, we were understanding how to manipulate these properties and how to change the outcome by changing the structure of the polymer.  So, that describes the work.  It involves making the polymers and characterizing them.
Speaker 1: That sounds exciting.  Sounds like something that, yeah--.  Now, what application--well, what application was something like that?
Speaker 2: At the time that we working on a project, we were thinking about everything from sensors to, you know, gauges to displays.  So, here's a very simple example.  The Air Force was talking to my advisor about potentially using these as coatings on airplane wings.  You would actually see added stress in a wing structure if you saw a color change or detected a color change on the wing.  And, of course, you could use detection equipment to determine or examine that color change, as well as, you know, the human.  There's this sort of computer eye that can do that as well.  So, this was one example of--there's also some NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] people who were interested in this, being able to detect changes in stress of a system when it's in space, and there's no other way to examine it.  So, some of the mechanochromic sort of interest went in that direction.  And a thermochromic went in the direction of being able to detect temperature in vessels being able to generate displays which are based on laser heat, and all of these kinds of things, yeah, which can lead to a range of fun things as well, including packaging.  Some people from packaging companies were interested in this idea of having a polyurethane film.  You can imagine it might be a good or interesting thing for sneakers (laughs), as well for kids.  So, there were all--there're a very broad range of things that people like to talk about for these kinds of systems.
Story_ID: 24373
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, you did a post-doc at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?  Is that true?
Speaker 2: That's right.  I did a post-doctoral study at Harvard University in chemistry.
Speaker 1: This is still in '93 [1993]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I started my post-doc in September of '93 [1993].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And here it says in outline that you developed an interest in surface chemistry.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.  So, when I was in--this was the George Whitesides Research Group at Harvard University, a very well-known research group in chemistry.  And George had developed this method of creating essentially a molecular layer on the surface that would functionalize or change the property of that surface.  He could actually pattern those chemical layers in a way that allowed you to manipulate the surface layer and generate new structures or features.  So, these were the kinds of things which would allow you to make--you know how you lithographically etch a chip for a computer?  This was a way of doing this using stamps instead of high-level, high-res chemical etching methods in masking.  And he termed--coined the phrase, "soft lithography."  Soft for the stamp, which just a silicone stamp.  Well, I joined his group maybe six months after the first papers on this had come out, and I worked in his lab by using some of these soft lithography techniques.  One of them I actually adapted when I became a faculty member, which was in 1995, as I finished the post-doc, to direct the depth position of polymer thin films using electrostatic assembly.
Story_ID: 24374
Speaker 1: Oh.  Okay.  1993, George Whitesides said that "Hammond has a uncanny ability to take on projects unrelated to her previous work."
Speaker 2: That was very nice (laughs).
Speaker 1: And, immediately after completing your Ph.D. or almost immediately afterward, you were offered a position at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology].
Speaker 2: Yes.  In fact, it happened that I interviewed at MIT at the end of my--at the last year of my Ph.D.  So, I was made the offer at MIT and did my post-doc having already had the offer in hand, which was really a huge advantage, because--in fact, the reason I chose George's group was that, I wanted to experience an entirely different world and to be challenged in a very different way, and that's something George is excellent at.  He has this way of posing very unusual problems that lead to, you know, huge leaps in terms of the way we do things.  So, when I was interviewing, I was asked about my post-doctoral plans, and I began to look into whether I could do my post-doctoral position in George's group at that time; so everything came together almost at once.  I was made the offer.  George took me into his group, and I was able to spend my post-doc just doing the post-doc and not worrying about job searches, which was also a big plus.
Speaker 1: Well, it seems like you, you know, well, '93 [1993] was a good year (laughs).
Speaker 2: (laughs).  '93 [1993] was a good year.
Speaker 1: A very good year.  Now, some of the--now, so you've been at MIT, here, as a professor since 1993.
Speaker 2: Since 1995.
Speaker 1: '95 [1995].
Speaker 2: So, MIT made the offer and allowed me to work with George and my post-doc--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --before coming back, and I started officially at MIT in January of 1995.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 24375
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, since you've been here, professionally you've been involved with--and I'm going to ask you to explain some of these things.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Sure.
Speaker 1: It seems that we have a menu of your--of the areas you concentrate in.
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.  And I can help you narrow them too, if some of them are--some may be more important than others, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what about macromolecular design and synthesis?
Speaker 2: All right.  That just refers to the fact that we make new polymers.  We actually, in my group, have a couple of different skill sets.  One of them is what you just described.  We can, understanding the function that we want a polymer system to have, design the polymer to do what we anticipate it needs to do.  So, we actually use synthetic chemistry as a tool in that case to make a new material system that will do what, you know, the desired function.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I don't know if it's time to talk about this or not, but this is--I guess this what you--this is the core of what you're doing now.  I guess, it's you're using-- you're doing nanomaterials--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --where you're able to layer different compounds together and make new materials.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Exactly.  And, in fact, that's the other skill set that we use.  We put that all in the category of self-assembly or directed assembly.  We take a material that has a certain interaction with another material, and in a controlled fashion, assemble a new structure from those two systems, two or more systems.  Sometimes even one singular system can undergo soft assembly.  In this case it's two systems.  We're taking a positively and negatively-charged material and alternating them.  And, in doing so, we create nanoscale layers, and we build these materials nano layers at a time, and we can put different material systems into different layers.  With that level of  control, we can design a material system from the bottom up, and determine what function exists, and how it will function based on what we incorporate into the film.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And this is--the final product is a thin film, right?
Speaker 2: The final product is a very thin film, sometimes as thin as a few (tenths?) of nanometers; sometimes as thick as microns.  And, we can actually coat a very broad range of things, very large structures as large as--well, there's no limit.  It essentially can be--very large structures can be coated or very, fine, tiny structures and features can be coated.  So, we can coat everything from a nano particle that's used for drug delivery, to an electrode that is used in electrical chemical energy applications, to a very large surface that is used as an optical reflector for an antireflective surface for a large glass structure, for example.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this is what you mean by self-organized polymer systems?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That's one of the ways in which we generate self-organized polymer systems.  The other is to use that synthetic tool to create a molecule that assembles with itself in water, and we make some of those systems as well.  They assemble into micellar particles, small nanoparticles when they're in water, based on hydrophobic or water hating and hydrophilic or water-loving segments.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  What about alternating electrostatic layer-by-layer assembly?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's what you just described.
Speaker 2: That's what I just described.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Layer-by-layer assembly.  The automated pieces that we--the process I was describing originally was done by dipping and allowing time for the material to absorb it to go on time.  We developed an automated approach that sprays these systems one after the other, and we can generate the films much faster.  One of my students invented this approach.  We patented it, and we actually have a company he founded called, Svaya Nanotechnologies in Sunnyvale, California.  It was founded in 2009, and it's in its third round of funding right now.  And he's the one who's coating things that are as large as this table or long, rolled, reel-to-reel pieces of film, using the layer-by-layer technique.
Story_ID: 24376
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what are polymeric biomaterials?
Speaker 2: Polymers are the materials that I work with in all of my work.  Now, the biomaterials are actually a range of things.  Some of them are for drug delivery.  They're materials that regulate the release of drugs, perhaps protect drugs from things in the bloodstream that you don't want to interact with your drug or protect healthy cells from drugs that may have a negative effect, until you get it to the place you want.  Other kinds of biomaterials are used to help cells grow and function, and some of those can be used for tissue engineering to help cells develop into tissues in a polymer scaffold.  And some of them are used to just study cells and examine how they behave in certain environments.  All of those fall under that broad category, but we do work in those areas.
Story_ID: 24377
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, now, what about liquid crystalline polymers and block polymers?
Speaker 2: So, actually, that's an area of work that was--we did a lot work in.  We don't work in it right now, but it actually involves using elf-assembly of polymers to generate materials that have some sort of responsive behavior.  And some of the things we worked on were rubbery materials that would, actually, you know, with light, that's one of the areas that we worked on.
Speaker 1: It actually moved the light?
Speaker 2: Yes, bend or curve or contract.  Exactly.  These are part of a series of responsive materials.  In the biomaterials area, we also work with things that respond.  So, a lot of the things that I work on my group have that theme of responding to some stimuli.  Some of them fall apart at a certain PH or change in the presence of a certain PH or some other trigger that you might experience in the body.  That allows a drug to be released at a certain time, for example.  There are a number of other examples using temperature, a number of other triggers.
Story_ID: 24378
Speaker 1: Okay.  What are dendrines and dendritic block polymers?
Speaker 2: Dendritic block copolymers, okay.  Well, you know what?  I think--so this is a list of the different areas and the different kinds of molecules that I make.  But it perhaps isn't giving you a good idea of how our research comes together, and so, maybe what I'll do is, I'm going to invert it, and I'll describe to you our research group.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And here's hoping that it comes together and makes sense.  In our group, we do use those techniques I talked about.  The two most important tools we use are the ability to design our own molecules, and because we're polymer scientists they're big molecules, they're macromolecules; and, our ability to make those molecules assemble.  So, in our work we actually use both tools to generate material systems that have some very specific function.  In the biology area, this field we refer to as biomaterials, we're interested in delivery of drugs from surfaces which can be large surfaces or small ones.  In large surfaces, typically, we're interested in the release of drugs from implant surfaces.  So, imagine, for example, an orthopedic implant around which you want the native bone of the patient to grow to fortify that joint.  We actually have been developing layer-by-layer, these very nanoscale thin films which contain the proteins that signal cells to come and generate bone.  So, essentially, we can recruit the stem cells in--that are already present in the body, the adult stem cells, to the area that the implant exists in.  And those cells are then transformed into bone cells, due to the presence of the protein that we're releasing from our film.  This is form of tissue engineering.  And doing so, we can actually generate or manipulate bone and the growth of bone around an implant.  We also have a similar application in which we're looking at healing wounds by recruiting cells that are involved in wound healing, and manipulating them so that we can avoid scaring or fibrosis while promoting healthy healing.  We have a project that involves diabetic ulcers, which are a kind of wound that can't close because the wrong balance of proteins is present.  We're looking at introducing RNA, which is what, part of the genetic coding system that will turn off the genes that cause problems in wound closure and diabetic ulcers.  We also have developed very, sort of immediate use systems.  A lot of the first examples involved developing new tissue and new bone over long time periods.
Story_ID: 24379
Speaker 1: And we've also developed layer-by-layer films that release things that you need immediately.  One of them is coating of a gelatin sponge for layer-by-layer film that releases a hemostat, something that will stop bleeding immediately, so that when a soldier that carries this pack around places it on a wound, he can rapidly stop or staunch a wound on him or on a fellow soldier.  It releases a protein called thrombin, which is part of the clotting cascade.  We have a similar system that releases both the thrombin and a broad-spectrum antibiotic called Vancomycin.  So, again, imagine a soldier on the battlefield with a dirty wound from the many dirty bombs ((unclear).  Putting--throwing that on allows immediately release, stops the bleeding, and stops infection.  That's on big surfaces.  On small surfaces, we're coating nanoparticles--they're extremely small--that are designed to go through the bloodstream and reach the target of interest for a specific disease or condition.  In cancer, which is why we're here at the Koch Institute, we're targeting tumors, and the drug is a poison; it's chemotherapy drug.  So, the idea of being able to encapsulate the drug inside a nanomaterial, keep it from interacting with the healthy cells along the way in an intravenous injection, get through the bloodstream, and somehow find that tumor, is what we work on with the coating of the particle.  We take a particle that contains the drug and then we coat it.  Sometimes we even incorporate a second drug on the outside layers that gets released first.  And we designed a very outermost layer so that it has molecules that bind to only the cancer cells and not healthy cells, and that prevent interactions with the regular cells.  So that's sort of how a lot of the biomaterials work.  The block copolymers, including the dendrimers that you talked about, are another kind of material system we designed, but we design them so that they self-assemble in the presence of a drug to encapsulate it in water.  They also are nanometer sized, they also go through the bloodstream, and we use a different mechanism to target them.  We can design them so that they present these specific groups that binds to the cancer cell in clusters that are very highly binding, so that we can get sort of antibody-like binding to the cancer cell without using an antibody, and get very, very specific targeting, which is what you want.  In chemotherapy, the side effects are due entirely to the fact you have toxin being delivered to healthy parts of your body, especially the parts that grow rapidly.  And in doing this, we can actually direct the targeting.
Story_ID: 24380
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, what have been, I guess, your career research highlights?  I know--now, you teach and do research, right?
Speaker 2: I teach and do research.  That's right.  I would say some of the career highlights include some of our more recent work, including nanoparticle drug delivery work that we've been doing.  We've been able to find, very recently in our lab, a way to generate RNA, which is the mechanism we can use to turn off bad genes that can cause disease or promote disease in a way that is very unique.  It allows us to deliver a large amount of RNA in a nanoparticle without causing toxic side effects, which are common with other methods of RNA encapsulation.  So, that's something I think is a highlight, and we just published the work last year.  Some of the earlier highlights include the work that we've done in designing these layer-by-layer films to release different drugs at different times, and it's something that we've been able to demonstrate with simple systems, but we're now trying to make more advanced films so that you can, for the implant example, release antibiotics, get rid of any infection, and release the growth factors to bring in these new healthy cells to the body.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, we were reading about a partnership--well, a research agreement that you all made with--that MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] made with Farrosan.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  That's right.  This is with the sponge that stops bleeding, essentially.  And we, actually, from that work developed a coating that can be released or deployed very rapidly.  And that's another very recent highlight in our work, which we hope will, ultimately, be licensed, and used--deployed to the Army.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's exciting stuff.  Now, you're written over 150 articles or maybe more by now.  I know this is an old project.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Yes.  It's a little over 200 now, but it's close (laughs).
Story_ID: 24381
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, in 2003 you were named the Mark Hyman, Jr. Career Development Chair.  Now what is that?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  So, the Chairs are given by the departments or the university to support a faculty member.  It pays for the faculty member's salary, but also gives the faculty member a discretionary account that they can use.  And they're considered honors, an honor to have a Chair.  Right now I have the David H. Koch Chair in Engineering, and that is one that is specifically given to--there are three of us, three engineers who are working on cancer-related issues.  And that's also been a big honor.  It's an institute-wide Chair.  In terms of things that may be relevant, more to your question, I think last year I was named one of the top 100 Materials Scientists Over the Decade.  This was done by Thompson Ryders (sic) which is actually the company that runs the ISI Citation Index.  And they base it on the number of citations that different scientists have, and they've tallied these over the period of 2000-2010.  So that was a big honor.  And I think other highlights include some of the, you know, recent honors.  I've been recognized as a Fellow in the ACS [American Chemical Society], and as a Fellow in the American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering.  I also received several career awards during my time as a faculty member, including the National Science Foundation Career Award, which used to be called the Young Investigator Award.
Speaker 1: Right. Right.  You're now, as of 2006, a Fellow in the American Physical Society.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Right.   (Conthley?) Lecturer, I guess I'm pronouncing it right?
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right.
Speaker 1: Irwin Sizer Award.
Speaker 2: That's here.
Speaker 1: Out here at MIT.  2010, you were Scientist of the Year.
Speaker 2: That's why, at Harvard--
Speaker 1: At Harvard Foundation.
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right.
Speaker 1: Einstein Conference.  2008 Top 100 Scientists of 2008, Discover Magazine.  These are all honors.
Story_ID: 24382
Speaker 1: So, when you look back on everything that you've done to this point, well, today, would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think in terms in science, some of the things I was describing with regard to controlling the materials properties on a nano layer-by-layer basis to generate these very functional, thin film systems.  I think, big picture, we've been able to sort of show how you can use that kind of approach to develop a very broad range of responsive material systems, both for drug delivery, and even for energy, and some of the other applications that we worked on.  So, I think that will be, to a large extent, my legacy.  In terms of other parts of life, I think the biggest thing that I've given are the students and the post-docs that have come from my group, and are now going out into the world investigating materials on their own, investigation the world on their own.  They've gone into several different areas, but I think I feel like I've given something to each of them, and that's important to me to be able to give back to scientists in the community, and these young scientists who are developing their perspective on the world, and thinking about how their work can impact the world.
Story_ID: 24383
Speaker 1: What advice would you give a young minority in the sciences today, and especially, maybe, in chemical engineering?
Speaker 2: To stick with it, even if you're challenged.  When you face a challenge during the process of becoming who you want to become, you have to remember what the final goal is and find a way to get there.  So, when you're beginning to feel discouraged, look for things that inspire you, look for problems to get you excited, to get you motivated, and use that as a way to pull you through what can sometimes be the harder parts of your class work, or the drier parts of your lecture, and find a way to make that interesting to you.  Find what gets you excited and motivated so that you can actually stay focused on your work.
Story_ID: 24384
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you look back, again, at the things you've done to this point, you're still relatively young for the interviews that we do.
Speaker 2: (Laughs.)
Speaker 1: So, is there any major thing that you would do differently now, if you could go back and change something/
Speaker 2: Not that immediately jumps to mind, and because it doesn't immediately jump to mind, I imagine that there probably isn't.  I think I've experienced a great deal of--a large number of different environments.  I've been in an industrial environment.  I've been in a research institute environment.  I have been in the academic environment.  And I think that's actually opened up my perspective, my ability to understand how we can solve problems using science and technology in a way that I may not have had if I hadn't forayed into the industrial side of life before going back into the academic side.  So, I think in that sense I actually came back to graduate school with an inspiration to actually apply things in a way that I wouldn't have had if I had--if I hadn't worked.  And with regard to other steps in my life, I think everything added to what I know how I understand and how I view the world, you know.  So, right now, I think about the fact that I have a relatively full plate.  But, to be honest, I've probably been most productive at times when I've had a relatively full plate.  So, although there are times, most of the time (laughs) when I think it would be nice to sort of narrow, or trim, or make things a little bit more streamlined for myself, the reality is that, I think I have created a world in which I am engaged frequently.  But it makes me productive, it makes me motivated, and it pushes me to actually come up with solutions I might not have if I had more free time (laughs).
Story_ID: 24385
Speaker 1: We always ask this question:  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African-American community today?
Speaker 2: I think there are a few.  One of them is the gap that we have in terms of a black middle class.  And I think that during the time I was growing up, a large number of African-American kids had access to a great education, to a range of different career choices.  And it was my expectation that we would continue to move in that direction.  But I think that, over time, what we've seen is the gap get bigger between poor blacks and the rest of the world.  And I'm worried that if we don't address some of those issues by looking at our policy for education, by looking at how we allow access for students to elite institutions, that we're going to lose all of those gains that I got to experience personally.  I think my other concerns have to do with the fact that African-Americans have appeared less interested in science and engineering than even when I was a young person.  There was always an interest gap (laughs).  But I'm concerned that the interest is getting bigger.  And these are the careers that will get you somewhere, no matter what.  They are the careers that will lead to exciting experiences, but will also lead to sound, solid jobs that will help move our community forward, and having the black community immersed in the technological world means we're immersed in a world that is decision-making.  Because our ability to leverage technical knowledge is going to determine our political position, our political leverage.  It's going to determine our ability to impact social situations.  And, right now, I'm concerned that we are not enabling the beset position with regard to the technological world.  We're not making decisions in that world.  We're not impacting it in the way that we should.  So those are my concerns.
Story_ID: 24386
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, we always ask about your nuclear family.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Would you tell us what your nuclear family is today.  I know you were married once before.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: You're married once again.
Speaker 2: That's right.  So from my first marriage, I have a son and his name is James Hammond.  And I remarried.  My husband is Carmon Cunningham.  And, yes, so my son was born Therese Hammond.  He's transgender, and he came out while he was in high school.  He's a very brave young man, and he's now in college at Northeastern University.  And he's doing incredibly well.  He's actually studying psychology and American Sign Language.  He speaks Russian, and he also knows a little Spanish and Latin (laughs).  And he plays guitar and trumpet.  My husband is an entrepreneur.  He actually started a dry cleaning chain, and he's been working on that and developing that over the past few years.  Before that he worked for a non-profit organization called "Jobs for the Future," and their focal point was actually improving the number of jobs in that middle-income range accessible to those who tended not to graduate from high school, trying to get students from that, say, junior year of high school all the way up and through, at least, a two-year to four-year degree.  So, he and I both have similar interests in the importance of education.  Now, so that's my nuclear family.  It's a nice, small, compact unit.  I have a stepson who's going to get married very soon from my husband's previous marriage.  His name is Dante, and Dante is a business major.  And--I mean, he was a business major, now he's a businessman who has gone back for his MBA [Master's of Business Administration] at Indiana University.  So, there's myself, my husband, James and Dante, and yeah.  That's it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are your parents still alive?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  I didn't know they were nuclear (laughs).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.  So, now both of my parents live in Detroit, and they both celebrated their 80th birthdays a couple of years ago.  And my husband, his mother is still alive.  Yeah, so.  It's actually--it's good to have our parents available to us, and I've very blessed in that sense.  Yeah, my husband's father just passed away a few months ago.
Story_ID: 24387
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, is there anything else we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No.  I'm too curious about your last question, so (laughs).
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, the last question is similar to legacy, but it's a little bit different.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered as someone who always cared and always gave to others as much as I could.  I would like to be remembered as someone who fostered learning, and encouraged and supported others to become their best.  I think at the core I am a teacher, and an educator, and I want to be remember as someone who launched others on incredible journeys of their own, and was able to give that spirit, that knowing that you can do or accomplish anything that you want to, not only in my own family and those who are close to me, but to everyone that I engaged with or interacted with.
